355
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,194
- [Zak] I am not going to do it.
- [Billy] Come on, man.

356
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:46,295
- I said he can't swim.
- [Billy] Too bad,

357
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:47,461
- he's gonna do it.
- Hey!

358
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:48,528
- Jump, retard.
- [Zak screams]

359
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,664
[Tyler] Didn't I just say...

360
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:02,063
[urinating]

361
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,098
You said there's wrestling
schools in Ayden?

362
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:09,329
Yes.

363
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,063
We're in Manteo.
That's right here.

364
00:25:15,364 --> 00:25:18,062
One long road leads all the way
down to Florida.

365
00:25:18,064 --> 00:25:21,164
That's where I'm going.
Where you're going is Ayden.

366
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:24,164
That's where the wrestling
school is you're talking about.

367
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:26,331
You see that? It's on the way.

368
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:28,661
You bullshitting me
about this wrestling school?

369
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:29,564
You swear to God?

370
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:34,064
Yes, I swear to God,
I have proof on the videotape.

371
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,731
All right.

372
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,331
I'll drop you there, then.

373
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,095
I ain't doing no charity shit.
It's just on my way.

374
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:43,164
Get up.

375
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,631
So, what is your name?

376
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:54,197
Tyler.

377
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,765
That is a very cool name.

378
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:02,765
[Eleanor] Excuse me.

379
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,131
Have you seen
this young man anywhere?

380
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,430
Have you seen him anywhere?
His name's Zak.

381
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:09,732
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

382
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:12,127
I'm just wondering
if you have seen

383
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,429
this young man anywhere.

384
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:15,531
My name's Eleanor.
I wrote it down right there.

385
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,497
[knocks on door]

386
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,530
[Ratboy] You see a dude
come through here?

387
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,829
About this tall? Beard?

388
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:30,529
A real piece of shit.
You seen him?

389
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:32,362
Huh? What happened to your face?

390
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:33,461
What happened to your face?

391
00:26:33,463 --> 00:26:35,230
You seen him? Huh?

392
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,497
Where'd he go?

393
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,531
Tell me.

394
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,198
What'd they know?

395
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:47,031
They didn't see shit.

396
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,565
[Zak] Hey, Tyler.

397
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:53,664
My feet hurt.

398
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,665
[Tyler spits]

399
00:26:57,831 --> 00:27:00,097
Do you have a car?

400
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:03,498
Tyler?

401
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:07,697
Can we walk on the road?

402
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,131
Uh, excuse me?

403
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,664
Will you please answer me?

404
00:27:16,097 --> 00:27:18,228
Let me tell you something.
I'm gonna tell you a story.

405
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,327
I'm gonna tell you a story.

406
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:21,828
When I was younger,
my brother and I were camping

407
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,428
at this place
called Caffey's inlet,

408
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,395
and there was a big-ass
hornet's nest down by the water.

409
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:26,796
So I walked over to them
all excited.

410
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,064
I'm young, I'm into baseball.

411
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:30,295
And I hit that son of a bitch
like a fucking home run.

412
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:32,161
And it exploded on me,
and I got stung up real bad.

413
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:33,829
My face swelled up,
my eyes got real tight,

414
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:35,595
and I couldn't see shit.
Walked back into camp

415
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:37,595
and my brother Mark said to me,
"You keep stirring up shit,

416
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:39,231
you're gonna get yourself
killed, boy."

417
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,131
You understand what I'm saying?
You ever kick a hornet's nest?

418
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,598
Last night.

419
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:49,162
You hit a hornet's nest
last night?

420
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:50,163
Last night.

421
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,264
So you understand why we can't
go up on that road then?

422
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:56,628
Stop with this "Tyler" shit.

423
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,298
We're gonna be quiet
the rest of the way.

424
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,732
- [Zak] Tyler.
- Oh, my...

425
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,462
Finish what you got to say.

426
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:07,828
Finish what you have to say,
and then we'll walk on silent.

427
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,195
We're not gonna do this no more.

428
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:11,631
"Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler,"
what?

429
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:16,031
[Zak] I want you to know
about me.

430
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:20,697
I am a Down syndrome person.

431
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,530
I don't really give a shit.

432
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:33,264
Do you got supplies on you?

433
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:35,298
That's what we need, don't we?

434
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,230
You got supplies?

435
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,227
- [Zak] No.
- [Tyler] No, you don't.

436
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:44,464
No, you don't.

437
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:46,697
No more, "Tyler, Tyler."
No more.

438
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,530
Have you got any money?

439
00:28:56,463 --> 00:29:00,398
No. No, I have no money,
and I got no pockets.

440
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,464
I'm going to give you pockets.

441
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:09,598
There's pockets.

442
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:13,795
I'm going to go in there
and get essentials.

443
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:15,331
- Can I come?
- [Tyler] No.

444
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:23,464
[bell clangs]

445
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,095
[cashier] That'll be, uh...

446
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:31,698
Let me get a sandwich.
Hold on.

447
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,665
All right, then.

448
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:35,664
That'll be...

449
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:39,428
$13.83.

450
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,697
What?

451
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,128
Well, son, that sandwich alone
is four dollars.

452
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,629
Well, forget the sandwich.
How much now?

453
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:49,561
[cashier] And your Ding Dongs,
they're two dollars apiece.

454
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:52,531
- And that's another $1.35.
- [Tyler] All right, how about...

455
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,198
that, just that?

456
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:57,598
Three dollars.
And call it even.

457
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,729
- Peanut butter.
- Yeah, all right. That'll work.

458
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:02,461
Just the peanut butter
and fishhooks.

459
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:06,528
[cashier] Yes, sir.
Uh, pardon me if I seem alarmed,

460
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,529
but I don't normally negotiate
with fellas

461
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,228
if they got shotguns
all over their back.

462
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,398
Oh, shit.

463
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,030
I understand.

464
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:15,461
- Ooh, thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

465
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:16,630
Hey, you got any of the...

466
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:19,262
You got any of them
two-dollar airplane whiskeys

467
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:21,298
- back there?
- [cashier] No, but...

468
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,495
I got this.

469
00:30:26,497 --> 00:30:27,828
Oh, I can't afford that.

470
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,828
[cashier] It's on me, son.

471
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,162
It looks like you might need it
more than I do.

472
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,465
I'm just going to get
a little swig to calm my nerves.

473
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,162
Sure. Yeah.
You made it?

474
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:42,530
[cashier] I did, sir.

475
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:47,497
Ooh!

476
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:50,197
- Yeah, you did.
- [bell clangs]

477
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,631
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

478
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:56,730
[Eleanor] Gentlemen.

479
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,294
Sorry.

480
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,761
[cashier] Ma'am, you'll have
to forgive me

481
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:09,127
for staring at you,
but you're one of the prettiest

482
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:11,130
women I've seen in ages.

483
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:13,598
Where did you blow in here from?

484
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:17,261
- Richmond. Mm-hmm.
- Richmond? That's nice.

485
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:20,565
So you, uh...
You graduated JMU, or GW?

486
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:22,562
- [Eleanor] GW.
- Yeah.

487
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,094
Yeah, you got that look
about you.

488
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:25,660
[Eleanor] Oh, yeah?
What kind of look is that?

489
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:28,628
You know, just an "excited
to be alive" kind of look.

490
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,030
What you doing up here?

491
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,062
You're nosy, aren't you?

492
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,331
Yeah, nosy.
That's the word for it.

493
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,263
Nosy. Or interested.

494
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,362
- Interested?
- [Tyler] Yeah. Interested.

495
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:38,498
Are you interested?

496
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,594
No, I'm working.

497
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:42,498
Working.
What, you working crab boats?

498
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:44,029
[chuckles]

499
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:45,761
- [Eleanor] No.
- I know, that's funny,

500
00:31:45,763 --> 00:31:47,295
- because you...
- [Eleanor] I know why you think

501
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:49,127
- that's funny.
- Oh, you're trouble. I see.

502
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:50,163
Okay, you don't like jokes.

503
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:52,227
I'm looking
for a missing person.

504
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:53,495
Have either of you gentlemen...

505
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:56,661
I'm assuming I can use
the word "gentlemen."

506
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:57,795
- Have you seen him?
- No.

507
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:59,231
I ain't... I ain't seen him.

508
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,331
[Eleanor] Have you seen him?

509
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:04,227
Why? What'd he do?

510
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:06,395
[Eleanor] He ran away
from the nursing home I work at.

511
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:09,330
- Why? Have you seen him?
- So you got some kind of reward?

512
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:10,528
No.

513
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,697
What are you?
Are you a bounty hunter?

514
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:14,794
Would I be a bounty hunter
if I just said

515
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:16,529
- there's no bounty?
- No.

516
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:18,461
What are you, his sister?
Minder or something?

517
00:32:18,463 --> 00:32:20,062
Not that it's any
of your business,

518
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:22,562
but I care about him,
and he's alone,

519
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:24,098
- and I want to find him.
- [Tyler] Maybe.

520
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:26,362
- Maybe? Maybe what?
- Yeah, yeah.

521
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:27,795
Well, maybe he's alone.
Maybe he ain't alone.

522
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:28,695
You know, you don't know.

523
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,861
What if he's living
the American dream

524
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:33,428
and, you know, he just ran
into a bunch of hitchhikers?

525
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,561
You know, like the Mark Twain
story or something.

526
00:32:35,563 --> 00:32:37,763
- Mm-hmm.
- You like Mark Twain?

527
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:40,628
- Thank you.
- You like Louis L'Amour?

528
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,727
- You got a phone number?
- [Eleanor laughs]

529
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:45,228
- Yeah, I got a phone number.
- Yeah? You gonna give it to me?

530
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,760
So I find him,
what you want me to do?

531
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:48,727
- Just holler for you?
- Yeah, just do that.

532
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,131
Yeah? You got a name?

533
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,597
- Yeah, I got a name.
- What is it?

534
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:54,498
Eleanor.

535
00:32:54,695 --> 00:32:56,498
- Eleanor.
- [door chimes jingle]

536
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:00,227
[exhales]

537
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,430
- [door closes]
- All right, partner.

538
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,531
Come back.

539
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,564

[Tyler laughs]

542
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:23,664
You're a goddamn criminal.

543
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,564
You're a goddamn criminal,
ain't you?

544
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,064
Fugitive, little man on the lam.

545
00:33:28,595 --> 00:33:30,560
Met your girlfriend
back there, Eleanor.

546
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:32,365
Cute one
from the old folks' home.

547
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,594
She likes you quite a bit.
Got a picture of you

548
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,693
and everything,
showing everybody.

549
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:37,327
That's not a bad thing.

550
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:38,593
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a good thing.

551
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:40,227
See, we're going 70 miles
upriver.

552
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:41,594
We need a tie that binds.

553
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:43,327
And this right here,
you being a wanted man,

554
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,194
this is it,
just the kind of tie we needed.

555
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:46,694
Hell, yeah.
Two bandits on the run.

556
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:48,727
- [Zak] Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah, partner.

557
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:49,628
Come on.

558
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,827
- [thunder rumbles]
- [Tyler] Hell, yeah!

559
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,529
[Zak laughs]

560
00:33:56,264 --> 00:34:00,530
Listen,
we got new rules now, all right?

561
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:04,198
We can't keep doing it this way.

562
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,327
New rule is,
you can't slow me down.

563
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,997
You understand? Put those on.

564
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:09,761
So, what I says go.

565
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:11,328
I say, "jump,"
you say, "how high?"

566
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,497
- [Zak] How high?
- There it is.

567
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,062
Rule number one:
don't slow me down.

568
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:18,061
Rule number two: I'm in charge,

569
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:19,563
and you're going to carry
your own weight.

570
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,461
- [Zak] You are in charge.
- That's right.

571
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:24,660
[Zak] Maybe we should...

572
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,430
Maybe we should have
our own secret handshake.

573
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,464
What kind of secret handshake?
For what?

574
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:34,064
Buds, dudes, friends.

575
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:35,794
The buds, dudes,
friends handshake?

576
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:37,262
All right, here.

577
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:38,130
Let's go, hurry up.

578
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,397
All right, three of those.
Four of those.

579
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:46,430
One of those.
Now what?

580
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:51,097
- Like that.
- Yeah.

581
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:53,596
Only when special shit happens,
though, all right?

582
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:55,364
[Zak] Yeah. Special things.

583
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:57,262
Special things. You don't curse.

584
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:58,694
- No.
- Why don't you curse?

585
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,697
- Because I don't.
- Okay, come on.

586
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,630
- You are in charge.
- Exactly.

587
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:05,398
Come on.

588
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:12,998
Hey, what's rule number one?

589
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:17,063
What's rule number one?

590
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,661
- [Zak] Party?
- [Tyler] No, not party.

591
00:35:19,663 --> 00:35:21,427
No, it's not party.
Don't slow me down.

592
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,364
That's rule number one.
Let's go, come on.

593
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:25,660
Come on, pick it up.

594
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:27,395
There you go.
You got boots on now.

595
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:30,263
Rule number one is not "party."
What is rule number one?

596
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,163
"Don't slow me down."

597
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:35,095
- Rule number one?
- [Zak] You are in charge.

598
00:35:35,097 --> 00:35:36,693
All right, all right.

we ain't got many options.

I'm not walking through
two days of brier bushes,

610
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:19,693
and we can't go back
the way we came.

611
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:22,197
So we're going swimming.
You got a better idea?

612
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:25,163
We could get a plane.

- [Zak groans]

614
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:30,660
- I can't swim.
- Yeah, I know you can't swim.

615
00:36:30,662 --> 00:36:32,064
But you can float.

616
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:38,763
Zak, I need you to listen to me.

617
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,228
That bag and them pants
are gonna hold air.

don't want to have

thinking about you sinking us.

am I going to die?

00:36:55,762 --> 00:36:57,593
Yeah, you're going to die.
It's a matter of time.

627
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:58,828
That ain't the question.
The question is,

whether they're going to have
a good story

629
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:01,428
to tell about you
when you're gone.

Why do you want to be

You got a good-guy heart.

00:53:26,262 --> 00:53:28,428
Hold on, ooh, I got an idea.

876
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:30,759
Hold on right there.
Wait right there.

877
00:53:30,761 --> 00:53:32,462
You got to make a uniform.

878
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:35,459
[yells] Falcon uniform!
Hell, yeah!

879
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:36,562
Falcon.

880
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:38,529
Hey!

881
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:41,160
Did I tell you could have
some of that peanut butter?

882
00:53:41,162 --> 00:53:42,727
- [Zak] Yeah.
- It ain't snack time,

883
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:44,429
it's jack time.
Here we go.

884
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:48,029
Woo-hoo!

885
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:49,629
We need war paint.

886
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:51,293
Yeah.

887
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:53,096
I need peanut butter.

888
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:56,160
You want to be slick.

889
00:53:56,162 --> 00:53:58,161
The Peanut Butter Falcon!

890
00:53:58,163 --> 00:54:01,097
[Tyler] Get it up!
Pick that sucker up!

891
00:54:01,295 --> 00:54:04,161
You got all the power,
power of Zeus.

892
00:54:04,163 --> 00:54:05,663
Push it! Push it! Push!

893
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:09,295
[Tyler yelling]

894
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:12,563
You got it!
You got it!

895
00:54:12,762 --> 00:54:15,197
[yells]
Peanut Butter Falcon!

896
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,592
[Zak coughs]

897
00:54:17,594 --> 00:54:18,695
You got it!

898
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:22,130
[inaudible]

899
00:54:41,762 --> 00:54:46,097
[Tyler distorted]
Falcon! Falcon! Falcon! Falcon!

900
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:50,262
[Zak distorted]
I'm the Peanut Butter Falcon!

901
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:01,295
[birds chirping]

902
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:16,762
[Eleanor] Zak.

903
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:20,328
Zak.

904
00:55:21,728 --> 00:55:23,226
Zak.

905
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:24,328
Oh, my God.

906
00:55:24,562 --> 00:55:26,295
Zak, are you okay?

907
00:55:27,063 --> 00:55:28,596
- Oh, my God.
- [Tyler] Hello!

908
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:31,997
Hey!

909
00:55:34,461 --> 00:55:36,161
- Come on, sit up.
- [Tyler] You found us.

910
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:38,094
That's them pheromones.
Like a bear.

911
00:55:38,096 --> 00:55:39,659
What is this?
What's on your face?

912
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:41,328
- [Tyler] Yeah!
- I thought you said

913
00:55:41,528 --> 00:55:43,628
- you hadn't seen him.
- He's right there.

914
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:45,396
There he is.

915
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:47,727
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

916
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:49,392
- Come on. Thank you.
- No, you're good.

917
00:55:49,394 --> 00:55:51,627
You're good right there.
Sit right there, he's all right.

918
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:53,429
Okay, I don't know
what's going on, but...

919
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:55,726
[Tyler] Put that on, Zak.
Here, brother.

920
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:57,160
I've got it, thank you.

921
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:58,229
[Tyler] He could do it.

922
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:00,527
He could put his own shirt on.
He's 22-years-old.

923
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:01,763
Okay, thank you, I've got it.

924
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:04,196
- We're good now.
- Huh.

925
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,627
You ready? You good to go?
You okay?

926
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:09,459
- [Zak] Ah, my ankle.
- What? What...

927
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:10,693
- He's fine.
- What happened to his ankle?

928
00:56:10,695 --> 00:56:11,663
He's showing off
because you're here.

929
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:13,860
- What's wrong with his ankle?
- Nothing's wrong with his ankle.

930
00:56:13,862 --> 00:56:14,794
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

931
00:56:14,796 --> 00:56:16,696
- Who are you, even?
- Who are you, even?

932
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:19,793
You have a young boy
with Down syndrome

933
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:21,392
in the middle of nowhere.

934
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:23,193
I'm the one
who's been taking care of him,

935
00:56:23,195 --> 00:56:25,296
because you can't do it
unless you put him in a cage.

936
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:27,130
Okay, um...

937
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:30,293
look, he needs to be
properly taken care of,

938
00:56:30,295 --> 00:56:31,663
and that's my job.

939
00:56:32,062 --> 00:56:34,060
I'm sorry to break up
your little primitive gang,

940
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:35,559
- or whatever's going on...
- [Tyler chuckles]

941
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:36,660
...but this is not
<i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

942
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:39,093
You can't just... There's rules,
there's regulations.

943
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,292
- Okay.
- He has medication,

944
00:56:40,294 --> 00:56:41,492
- there's paperwork.
- Yeah, all right.

945
00:56:41,494 --> 00:56:42,426
Well, while you've been
doing paperwork,

946
00:56:42,428 --> 00:56:43,729
we've been doing something
called living,

947
00:56:44,128 --> 00:56:45,362
- ain't that right, brother?
- [Zak] Yeah.

948
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,696
Okay.

949
00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:49,596
Cool.

950
00:56:50,295 --> 00:56:51,395
[chuckles]

951
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:53,226
But we're going to go.

952
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:54,493
- So, thank you.
- No, we're not.

953
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:55,429
He's fine where he is.

954
00:56:56,227 --> 00:56:58,426
[sighs] May I please speak
to you in private?

955
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:00,428
Oh. Oh, like a private party?
Yeah, all right.

956
00:57:01,062 --> 00:57:02,826
- One second, Zak.
- I got water, you want water?

957
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:04,195
[Eleanor] Right now.

958
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:06,193
[Tyler] Primitive gang.
Hell, yeah.

959
00:57:06,195 --> 00:57:08,193
I like when you put
your hair up like that.

960
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,429
It's nice. Some water?

961
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:15,261
Look, I could have you arrested
for kidnapping, okay?

962
00:57:15,462 --> 00:57:17,093
Oh, you're going to have me
arrested for kidnapping?

963
00:57:17,095 --> 00:57:18,061
How do you figure?

964
00:57:18,063 --> 00:57:19,429
You can't have me arrested.
He's a runaway.

965
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:20,759
Can't kidnap a runaway.
Come on, genius.

966
00:57:20,761 --> 00:57:22,293
You said GW, didn't you?

967
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:24,326
I'm sure I could find
some reason to arrest you.

968
00:57:24,328 --> 00:57:26,096
Hey, let me ask you,
what do you want for him?

969
00:57:27,261 --> 00:57:29,259
I'm not going to sell him
to you.

970
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:32,195
No, no, what do you want
for his life? His future?

971
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:35,663
Why are you... You don't know

972
00:57:36,763 --> 00:57:37,726
- anything about him.
- You know about the wrestling?

973
00:57:37,728 --> 00:57:38,826
Yes, of course I know
about the wrestling.

974
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:40,362
All right, so I know something
about him, don't I?

975
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:43,526
So, uh, you're a little late
to the party.

976
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:45,295
This is what's going on.
I made a promise to him,

977
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,160
to get him to that wrestling
school in Ayden.

978
00:57:47,162 --> 00:57:48,329
- [Eleanor] Oh.
- [Tyler] You understand?

979
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:50,359
I gave him my word, and I ain't
gonna back down on my word.

980
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:51,629
Now, you seem like
a nice person.

981
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:53,826
You care for him and all.
You came all the way out here.

982
00:57:53,828 --> 00:57:54,560
Maybe it's because you like me.
I don't know.

983
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:57,360
And, uh,
I'mma offer you a favor.

984
00:57:57,362 --> 00:57:58,295
You can get on that raft with us

985
00:57:59,229 --> 00:57:59,696
and you can ride down there
if you want.

986
00:58:00,795 --> 00:58:03,759
N... No, we're not going to hop
on your little raft

987
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:06,293
- and cruise around the river.
- It's hot, you're confused.

988
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:09,030
- I'm not asking you.
- [Zak] Hey, Eleanor!

989
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:13,261
Oh! Ooh! Oh.

990
00:58:13,462 --> 00:58:14,462
Oh!

991
00:58:14,694 --> 00:58:17,396
I want to see...

992
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:21,162
Salt Water Redneck.

993
00:58:21,595 --> 00:58:23,826
And I don't want to go home.

994
00:58:23,828 --> 00:58:27,096
[crickets chirping]

995
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:46,095
[Eleanor clears throat]

996
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:50,363
So how far is it on, um...
On the raft?

997
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:53,628
About that far on a map.

998
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:58,730
- Are your fingers to scale?
- [Tyler] Yeah.

999
00:58:59,528 --> 00:59:02,092
So how much time is that much?

1000
00:59:02,094 --> 00:59:03,759
That's different
than what I put up.

1001
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:05,662
- [Eleanor] All right.
- What I did is about a day.

1002
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:07,563
Maybe two days.

1003
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:10,696
- Days? Like...
- [Tyler] Yeah.

1004
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:13,628
[chuckles]
Okay.

1005
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:21,061
- Are you kidding?
- [spits]

1006
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:23,696
What in the Christ...

1007
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:26,526
Hey, Zak,
why don't you sit down, bud.

1008
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:28,126
You're kind of close
to the edge.

1009
00:59:28,128 --> 00:59:29,429
I don't want you to fall in.

1010
00:59:31,394 --> 00:59:33,295
Hey, are you hungry?
Have you eaten anything?

1011
00:59:33,628 --> 00:59:35,559
I am not really hungry.

1012
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:37,560
[Eleanor] Well, maybe you should
just have a bite of something

1013
00:59:37,562 --> 00:59:38,427
for your blood sugar.

1014
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:40,092
[Tyler] He don't want
nothing to eat.

1015
00:59:40,094 --> 00:59:42,061
You know how you get, buddy.
I have an apple.

1016
00:59:42,262 --> 00:59:43,996
- Hey.
- I have some M&M's.

1017
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:46,126
- [Eleanor] What?
- Don't do that.

1018
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:47,295
[Eleanor] Don't do what?

1019
00:59:53,662 --> 00:59:55,660
Hey, I got an idea, why don't
we keep our training going.

1020
00:59:55,662 --> 00:59:57,126
Just because we're on a raft
don't mean

1021
00:59:57,128 --> 00:59:58,195
we gonna stop training, does it?

1022
00:59:59,428 --> 01:00:00,293
All right, so we're going to do
breathing control exercises.

1023
01:00:00,295 --> 01:00:01,294
She's worried
about your blood sugar.

1024
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:03,659
We're going to breathe.
Take a deep breath in.

1025
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:04,729
[inhales]

1026
01:00:05,161 --> 01:00:06,562
- Out.
- [exhales]

1027
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,325
All right, cool,
now, come over here

1028
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:09,995
and put your head underwater.
I'm gonna time you.

1029
01:00:10,562 --> 01:00:12,592
What? No, no, no.
He can't do that. Zak...

1030
01:00:12,594 --> 01:00:14,793
No, he can do that.
He can do that. He can...

1031
01:00:14,795 --> 01:00:16,596
[Tyler continues muffled]

1032
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:18,427
There you go.

1033
01:00:18,429 --> 01:00:20,126
You'd better stop calling him
a retard.

1034
01:00:20,128 --> 01:00:22,827
I have never called anyone a...
That word.

1035
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:23,694
Okay. Hold on, listen,

1036
01:00:23,696 --> 01:00:25,196
when people are saying
he's a retard,

1037
01:00:26,461 --> 01:00:27,061
really what they're saying is he
can't do some shit they can do.

1038
01:00:28,095 --> 01:00:29,159
See, you might not be saying
the word "retard",

1039
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:29,827
all right, I'll give you that,
but you damn sure

1040
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:31,526
is making him feel retarded.

1041
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:32,826
That ain't going to help
his life.

1042
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:34,826
- Hey, there we go.
- Time.

1043
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:36,128
- How long is that?
- Long.

1044
01:00:36,462 --> 01:00:38,162
Not long enough, Zak.
Do it again.

1045
01:00:38,494 --> 01:00:39,495
Okay.

1046
01:00:43,228 --> 01:00:46,096
You have got some real nerve
talking to me like that.

1047
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:47,995
Do you even know what I do?

1048
01:00:48,328 --> 01:00:51,226
I've spent the last two years
of my life volunteering

1049
01:00:51,228 --> 01:00:53,996
to hold people's hands
as they pass away.

1050
01:00:54,295 --> 01:00:56,592
I talk to them, I feed them,
I wipe their asses,

1051
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:58,663
I change their clothes,
I put them to bed.

1052
01:00:59,395 --> 01:01:01,129
And I'm the last person
they see.

1053
01:01:01,728 --> 01:01:03,726
Don't act like you know
jack shit about me.

1054
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:05,293
- All right.
- [Eleanor] Yeah,

1055
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,126
maybe he should not be
in a retirement home,

1056
01:01:07,128 --> 01:01:08,560
but I didn't choose that
for him.

1057
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:10,393
But that's what happened,
and now I am doing

1058
01:01:10,395 --> 01:01:12,496
- the best I can.
- [water splashes]

1059
01:01:12,728 --> 01:01:14,393

Hey! Oh, shit!

1061
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:18,695
God! Zak! Okay.

1062
01:01:19,127 --> 01:01:20,325
[Tyler] Yeah. Lunch!

1063
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:22,760
[Eleanor] Zak, did you just
catch that with your hands?

1064
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:23,763
[Zak yells]

1065
01:01:24,796 --> 01:01:26,192
[Eleanor] How'd you do that?
You're a wild man.

1066

[all laugh]

1067
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:29,028
Oh, my God.

[Tyler] <i>We got three options
for lunch today.</i>

1069
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:02,093
We can boil water
from the sound,

1070
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:03,262
make a little chowder.

1071
01:02:03,628 --> 01:02:04,794
- Huh?
- [Zak] Uh-uh.

1072
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:06,429
- Plain fish?
- [Zak] Uh-uh.

1073
01:02:06,729 --> 01:02:08,326
Fish with peanut butter?

1074
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:10,228
- Fish with peanut butter.
- Hey!

1075
01:02:10,462 --> 01:02:12,092
You got to give him
what he wants then.

1076
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:13,428
Here, go ahead.
Load up.

1077
01:02:14,395 --> 01:02:15,627
Oh, just right on there.

1078
01:02:15,629 --> 01:02:17,262
- There you go.
- [Eleanor] That's... Yeah.

1079
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:19,592
[Tyler] You want a big piece
or small piece?

1080
01:02:19,594 --> 01:02:21,659
- That's good, that's great.
- [Tyler] If you fold it,

1081
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:22,884
- you can make a little taco.
- Okay, that's nice.

1082
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:25,287
[Tyler] Yeah.
That's a good bite.

1083
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,821
That's good, huh?

1084
01:02:31,452 --> 01:02:32,387
Five stars.

1085
01:02:33,154 --> 01:02:34,254
You hear that?

1086
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:38,654
Bang.

1087
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:41,287
- Boom!
- What is that?

1088
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:43,355
That is...

1089
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:47,118
our... Our special handshake.

1090
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,385
- Yeah.
- That is our special thing.

1091
01:02:50,387 --> 01:02:51,785
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1092
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:53,451
[Eleanor] I want to have
a special handshake.

1093
01:02:53,453 --> 01:02:54,687
It's only for special shit.

1094
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:56,820
Like what kind of special shit?

1095
01:02:57,853 --> 01:02:59,218
I don't know. Go ahead.

1096
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,821
- [Eleanor laughs]
- No, you tell her.

1097
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:02,221
You brought it up.

1098
01:03:02,419 --> 01:03:04,017
Um, hmm...

1099
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:05,351
[Tyler] Tell her about the boat.

1100
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:06,386
[Zak] Oh, um...

1101
01:03:06,987 --> 01:03:09,217
we did... Hit by the boat.

1102
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,152
- [Tyler] Almost.
- You got hit by a boat?

1103
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:12,918
- [Tyler] Almost.
- [Eleanor] What happened?

1104
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,653
We almost got run over
by a shrimp boat.

1105
01:03:14,852 --> 01:03:16,154
- [Eleanor] What?
- Yeah.

1106
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,988
[Zak] And we did have the, um...

1107
01:03:19,753 --> 01:03:21,450
- shotgun.
- Shotgun, buckshot.

1108
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:22,884
He fired a shotgun.

1109
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:24,117
And we got shot at, remember?

1110
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:25,686

01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:36,127
and prostitutes, not Zak.

1214
01:10:37,694 --> 01:10:39,725
Yes, I know,
I did label him a flight risk,

1215
01:10:39,727 --> 01:10:42,194
but I just think that he might
be better suited in an...

1216
01:10:45,294 --> 01:10:46,660
I understand what you're...

1217
01:10:46,662 --> 01:10:48,825
[Zak grunts]

1218
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:49,892
Okay.

1219
01:10:49,894 --> 01:10:50,959
- Boo-yeah!
- [Eleanor] Okay,

1220
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:51,962
yeah, no, I get it.

1221
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:56,596
Okay, schedule his processing
for tomorrow afternoon then.

1222
01:10:59,728 --> 01:11:01,828
Oh, you mighty thirsty,
here you go.

1223
01:11:04,662 --> 01:11:06,229
Can I get you
anything else, hon?

1224
01:11:08,261 --> 01:11:09,262
No, I'm...

1225
01:11:11,762 --> 01:11:14,792
Actually, do you know
who the Salt Water Redneck is?

1226
01:11:14,794 --> 01:11:17,662
[laughs] Oh, everybody
around here knows Salt Water.

1227
01:11:18,027 --> 01:11:19,528
He used to be a celebrity.

1228
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:21,162
[chuckles softly]

1229
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,228
Do you know where he lives?

1230
01:11:28,128 --> 01:11:29,195
Maybe it's...

1231
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,692
- Let me see.
- Maybe it's not the right place.

1232
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:33,128
This is the right place, 5-3-0.

1233
01:11:35,193 --> 01:11:36,528
Yeah, this is it.

1234
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:48,827
[TV playing indistinctly]

1235
01:11:51,594 --> 01:11:52,660
[clattering]

1236
01:11:52,662 --> 01:11:54,862
[Clint] <i>Shit! Jesus Christ.</i>

1237
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,827
Who're you?

1238
01:12:00,793 --> 01:12:01,995
You're Salt Water Redneck?

1239
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:08,958
What is this?

1240
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,894
I'm sorry,
is this the wrestling school?

1241
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,761
[Clint] Who's asking?

1242
01:12:13,294 --> 01:12:14,495
My name's Tyler.

1243
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:18,629
I ain't selling nothing to you.
You see that boy back there?

1244
01:12:20,893 --> 01:12:23,728
- [Clint] Yeah.
- Yeah, so, we done, uh...

1245
01:12:24,662 --> 01:12:26,229
We done some hard traveling
to get to you.

1246
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:29,795
It's a big deal seeing you here.
You mind waving to him?

1247
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:34,728
He's got a lot riding on you.
You mind just waving to him?

1248
01:12:35,793 --> 01:12:36,795
[Clint] How you doing?

1249
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,760
[Zak] Hey.

1250
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:40,828
You don't teach no wrestling
school here no more?

1251
01:12:43,928 --> 01:12:45,795
I closed that
about ten years ago.

1252
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:49,661
Did you?

1253
01:12:56,028 --> 01:12:59,158
So I promised him he would...
He would do this one thing.

1254
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,728
You know, this wrestling thing.

1255
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,229
And he told me
about this school here in Ayden.

1256
01:13:03,827 --> 01:13:07,062
And we had... We had
a big journey to get here.

1257
01:13:07,628 --> 01:13:08,629
And, uh...

1258
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:11,825
now I got to break his heart,
you know?

1259
01:13:11,827 --> 01:13:13,760
And I don't really know
what to say to him.

1260
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,059
But that ain't your shit,
you know?

1261
01:13:20,061 --> 01:13:21,892
I don't mean to bring shit
to your doorstep

1262
01:13:21,894 --> 01:13:23,127
or nothing like that.

1263
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:26,694
What's your name?

1264
01:13:27,327 --> 01:13:28,694
- [Clint] It's Clint.
- Clint.

1265
01:13:31,727 --> 01:13:32,827
It's nice to meet you.

1266
01:13:34,028 --> 01:13:35,194
So... [clears throat]

1267
01:13:35,993 --> 01:13:38,658
- ...he used to be a fan?
- [Tyler] Oh, man, shit,

1268
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,694
you're his hero.

1269
01:13:40,728 --> 01:13:42,091
He believes in you.
That's a hard thing to do,

1270
01:13:42,093 --> 01:13:43,261
believe in something, you know?

1271
01:13:45,794 --> 01:13:46,828
Hey, Zak.

1272
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:48,259
Yeah.

1273
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:49,262
[Tyler] This is Clint.

1274
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:51,025
- Hey, Clinton.
- [Tyler] Hey, come up here.

1275
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:53,061
You mind if he comes
and says hi?

1276
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,827
That'd be all right.

1277
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:56,925
[Tyler] Hey, pal, Salt Water
don't live here no more.

1278
01:13:56,927 --> 01:13:59,926
But Clint's just a regular guy
like me or you.

1279
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:01,229
He wanted to shake your hand.

1280
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:03,127
Hey.

1281
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:07,995
- How are you doing?
- [Clint] Good.

1282
01:14:08,295 --> 01:14:09,728
Nice to meet you.

1283
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:11,928
[Zak] Thanks.

1284
01:14:12,861 --> 01:14:14,496
All right, thanks, partner.
Come on, bub.

1285
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:17,528
Nice to meet you, Clint.

1286
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:31,062
[Zak] Hey, Tyler.

1287
01:14:31,994 --> 01:14:32,995
[Tyler] What?

1288
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:38,795
I bet we could find him by...
By the raft.

1289
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:44,895
Maybe he is hiding by the swamp.

1290
01:14:46,261 --> 01:14:49,496
He's not real, bud.
Salt Water don't exist.

1291
01:14:50,627 --> 01:14:52,962
I saw the videotape...

1292
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:56,961
and he is real.

1293
01:14:57,694 --> 01:14:59,326
- He's not real, Zak.
- I just saw, like,

1294
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,293
a thousand movies of him.

1295
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:04,262
Zak, I don't think
we're going to find him.

1296
01:15:05,028 --> 01:15:07,229
I think it's time for us
to go back now.

1297
01:15:07,761 --> 01:15:09,195
[Zak] I don't want to go back.

1298
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,326
Tyler told me this,

1299
01:15:12,328 --> 01:15:15,195
and he lied to me,
and he promised me.

1300
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,661
And I don't wanna go back.

1301
01:15:18,827 --> 01:15:20,095
I wanna stay here.

1302
01:15:20,694 --> 01:15:23,760
[Eleanor] We can't, Zak.
We have lives to go back to.

1303
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,694
[Zak]
Eleanor, I am strong enough.

1304
01:15:27,893 --> 01:15:29,791
And I could catch a fish
for you.

1305
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:31,496
And I'm going to be a hero.

1306
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,727
And... And I could
take care of you.

1307
01:15:35,093 --> 01:15:36,995
We could be a family.

1308
01:15:42,694 --> 01:15:43,761
[rock clangs]

1309
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,228
[vehicle approaching]

1310
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:50,795
[engine revving]

1311
01:15:52,894 --> 01:15:55,561
[rock music playing over radio]

1312
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:07,795
[turns engine off]

1313
01:16:07,993 --> 01:16:09,495
Holy shit.

1314
01:16:09,761 --> 01:16:11,259
Salt Water Redneck.

1315
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:12,824
- It's you.
- Hey.

1316
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:14,225
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

1317
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:15,194
I'm doing good.

1318
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:18,559
- I am so happy to see you.
- I'm happy to see you.

1319
01:16:18,561 --> 01:16:23,059
And for me, I... I...
I saw so many videos about you.

1320
01:16:23,061 --> 01:16:25,058
Yeah? You want to learn
some wrestling?

1321
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,958
- [Zak] Oh, hell, yeah.
- [Eleanor laughs]

1322
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,194
And I feel great.
Um, can I...

1323
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:32,791
Uh, can I join you for the ride?

1324
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:34,859
- [Clint] Of course. Get in.
- And... And... And...

1325
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:37,628
- And can I bring my family?
- [Clint] Sure.

1326
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:42,528
I told you. I told you.
I told you. He's real.

1327
01:16:42,993 --> 01:16:45,761
Come on. Join us.
Have some fun.

1328
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:47,159
[engine starts]

1329
01:16:47,161 --> 01:16:48,226
Hang on.

1330
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:52,694
[rock music playing]

1331
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:55,826
[Clint]
The first thing you do is,

1332
01:16:55,828 --> 01:16:58,159
you're gonna kind of just, like,
you're gonna feel out,

1333
01:16:58,161 --> 01:16:59,825
you know, how big the ring is.

1334
01:16:59,827 --> 01:17:02,325
You just go, you know,
kind of check out,

1335
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:03,892
you know, what your space is,

1336
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:05,061
where you're gonna be
moving around.

1337
01:17:05,827 --> 01:17:08,126
All right, now,
one of the fundamentals

1338
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:10,226
is when you go to hit a guy
with an elbow.

1339
01:17:10,228 --> 01:17:12,059
You got to hit a guy
with an elbow,

1340
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,595
- but also do a foot stomp.
- [grunts]

1341
01:17:13,793 --> 01:17:15,559
Yeah.
But kind of pop your head too.

1342
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:16,992
- Just gives it more energy.
- [grunts]

1343
01:17:16,994 --> 01:17:18,561
Yeah. Okay, that's good.

1344
01:17:18,827 --> 01:17:21,761
Um, was there anything special
in the video

1345
01:17:21,994 --> 01:17:23,026
that you want me to teach you?

1346
01:17:23,028 --> 01:17:26,628
Uh, will you please show me
the Atomic Throw?

1347
01:17:27,295 --> 01:17:28,758
- [Clint] Ah.
- [chuckles]

1348
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,128
Yeah, the Atomic Throw.

1349
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:32,192
Honestly, Zak,
we just made that up.

1350
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:33,891
You know,
it was smoke and mirrors.

1351
01:17:33,893 --> 01:17:35,528
It was just a camera on my face.

1352
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:38,226
And then it looked like I was
holding the guy up over my head,

1353
01:17:38,228 --> 01:17:40,862
and then we'd cut to a guy
getting thrown out of the ring.

1354
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:42,859
It's not possible to do.

1355
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:44,695
But I can show you a lot
of other cool stuff.

1356
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:46,325
What do you think, Sam?

1357
01:17:46,327 --> 01:17:48,126
Might try a collar
and elbow lockup.

1358
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:49,691
There you go, a lockup.

1359
01:17:49,693 --> 01:17:51,691
All right, now, what you do,

1360
01:17:51,693 --> 01:17:53,195
you come in and boom,
right there, boom.

1361
01:17:53,827 --> 01:17:55,891
You know, boom, boom.

1362
01:17:55,893 --> 01:17:57,625
But when you come in to do it,

1363
01:17:57,627 --> 01:17:59,824
you got to really, really,
really slam...

1364
01:17:59,826 --> 01:18:01,559
- [Zak growls]
- [Clint] Yeah.

1365
01:18:01,561 --> 01:18:02,928
Yeah. Growl all you want.

1366
01:18:03,194 --> 01:18:04,792
See? Then we kind of...

1367
01:18:04,794 --> 01:18:06,892
Now we can move around
a little bit, like this.

1368
01:18:06,894 --> 01:18:08,558
You don't know
what I'm going to do...

1369
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,695
What are you gonna do?

1370
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:12,859
What do you mean?

1371
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:14,759
[Eleanor] I mean,
what are you going to do

1372
01:18:14,761 --> 01:18:18,062
after all this is over?

1373
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:21,895
[Tyler] Well, I'm gonna settle
my debts with Duncan.

1374
01:18:23,927 --> 01:18:26,027
I'mma go up to Jupiter, Florida.

1375
01:18:28,827 --> 01:18:31,628
Town called Jupiter up there
is a small little fishing town.

1376
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:33,225
It's on the Indian River,

1377
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:35,594
and it opens up
to this big estuary.

1378
01:18:37,627 --> 01:18:38,991
It's the biggest estuary
in America.

1379
01:18:38,993 --> 01:18:40,695
I'm gonna get a boat
and I'm gonna...

1380
01:18:41,761 --> 01:18:42,726
just live a good life.

1381
01:18:42,728 --> 01:18:45,660
Run charters
