1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,160
(silence)

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,700
(whooshing)

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,200
(zooming)

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,650
(eerie music)

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,530
(drum and gong music)

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,800
(tinkling)

7
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,070
(slow orchestral music)

8
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,960
(dark piano music)

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,120
(roaring)

10
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,690
(crashing)

11
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,270
(gun clicking)

12
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,790
(eerie music)

13
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,070
- Hello?

14
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,490
(dramatic music)

15
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,120
Hello?

16
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,140
(fire crackling)

17
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,460
(light drumming)

18
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,590
Hey, are you hurt?

19
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,100
(crashing)

20
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,370
(shouting)

21
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,440
(heavy footsteps plodding)

22
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,650
(screaming)
(roaring)

23
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,020
(dramatic music)

24
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,990
(bird chirping)

25
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,300
(light orchestral music)

26
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,140
- What are we doing here?

27
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,040
- I need to give Will a call.

28
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,310
- If you didn't get
rid of our cell phones,

29
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,840
you wouldn't have to
stop at a pay phone.

30
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,180
- Michael, I don't
know how many times

31
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,680
I'm need to say this to
you but, we're broke.

32
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,850
We can't afford to pay any
unnecessary phone bills

33
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
right now.

34
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Besides, there won't
be a place up there

35
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,420
to charge 'em anyway.

36
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,120
- Yeah, but we would
have saved on quarters.

37
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,080
(light music)

38
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,150
(clinking)

39
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,230
I thought we were
trying to save money.

40
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,760
- Well, when Will
comes to check on us,

41
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,030
he's gonna wanna relax, so
gonna have the essentials.

42
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,500
(light orchestral music)

43
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,240
(engine revving)

44
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,160
- Right here.

45
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,980
(dramatic music)

46
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,760
(heavy piano music)

47
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,830
(birds chirping)

48
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,610
Where's the cabin?

49
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,950
- Will said it's a few
hundred yards that a way.

50
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,020
Let's start gettin'
the stuff unloaded.

51
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,890
I don't want this
to take all day.

52
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,660
Here we go.

53
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,600
That'll (mumbles).

54
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,490
(heavy music)

55
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,180
Well, this doesn't look so bad.

56
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,350
(birds chirping)

57
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,170
Which one of these
opens the door?

58
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,740
Thanks for labeling these, Will.

59
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,710
(eerie music)

60
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,720
(door squeaking)

61
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,490
- What's going on?

62
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,030
- Stay right here.

63
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,970
(ominous music)

64
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,850
- What do you think happened?

65
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,020
- Looks like somebody
ransacked the place.

66
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,820
- You think they're
still around?

67
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,190
- No one else is in here.

68
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,790
I'm gonna go check around back.

69
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,900
You just stay right here.

70
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,770
(eerie music)

71
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,360
(crashing)

72
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,730
(sighing)

73
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,030
Whoever did this,
they're gone now.

74
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,700
Yeah, we gotta get
this place cleaned up.

75
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm gonna head over to the truck

76
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,070
and handle moving
all the boxes in here

77
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,710
and chop some firewood.

78
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,680
You just take care of this mess.

79
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,180
- What if they come back?

80
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,350
- Your uncle said
there hasn't been

81
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,680
anybody up here in years.

82
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,080
This could have
happened a long time ago

83
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,890
and no one's been
here to see it.

84
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,060
(laughing) You'll be all right.

85
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,360
Well, better get a move on.

86
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,430
Thanks for taking care of this.

87
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,470
(door slamming)

88
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,510
- (chuckling) Yeah, no problem.

89
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,720
(light piano music)

90
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,420
(door creaking)

91
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,770
- Comin' through.

92
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,310
That mess out there isn't
gonna clean itself, Michael.

93
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,180
Come on.

94
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,050
(sighing)

95
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,390
(birds chirping)

96
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,830
(muffled rock music)

97
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
(sweeping)

98
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,630
(light piano music)

99
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,020
(chopping)

100
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,330
How's the house comin' along?

101
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,200
- Good.

102
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,230
(chopping)

103
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,140
We got enough wood?

104
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,270
- We could always
use a little more.

105
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,640
Want a go at it?

106
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,540
- No.

107
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,950
I was thinking about asking
you if I could borrow the car.

108
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,220
- What for?

109
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,680
We brought everything we need.

110
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,290
(chopping)

111
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,390
- Yeah, uh, actually I
wanted to see if maybe

112
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,960
there was a college in the area
or somewhere I could access

113
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,960
online courses from in town.

114
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,330
- Michael, I don't wanna get
into another argument with you.

115
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,100
(chopping)

116
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,430
We talked about this before.

117
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,300
- Did we?

118
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,770
Because I remember bringing
it up and you saying no

119
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,270
without even listening to me.

120
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,840
- We're down to the
last of our savings.

121
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,780
I can't afford to
send you to school.

122
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,910
But maybe if you'd gotten
better grades, you know,

123
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,350
a scholarship would be
in the cards for ya.

124
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,320
- I'm sorry I was
distracted from my studies,

125
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,690
but have you ever heard of this
things called student loans?

126
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,890
- And you'd need me to
co-sign for your loans.

127
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,960
And my credit's been god-awful
since before the funeral.

128
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,960
I can't afford to
take on more debt.

129
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,760
(chopping)

130
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,230
- So, that's it?

131
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,770
My life is gonna consist
of living in a shanty

132
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,970
and working a minimum wage
job at some local feed store.

133
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
- We're both gonna
have to make do

134
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,450
with what's been given to us.

135
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,750
You're not the only
one who's grieving.

136
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,760
If you want the car,
you can take it in town

137
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,530
and look for job applications.

138
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,360
'Cause once I'm done
repairing things around here,

139
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,430
I'll be right there with you.

140
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,330
- And, it's not like you
could do both or anything.

141
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,770
(chopping)

142
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
- I'm gonna be busy
making this place livable

143
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,200
for quite some time.

144
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,800
And I might not be
making a paycheck,

145
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,340
but my days are gonna
be filled with work.

146
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,640
- Never mind.

147
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,310
I'm gonna go inside and
wait for Uncle Will.

148
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,780
- Well, you can't just
do nothing all day.

149
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,950
Why don't you, uh,
clean up that back room

150
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,120
so Sergio can have a place to
sleep 'cause of his bad back.

151
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,550
- Sergio's coming?

152
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,720
- Yeah, him and Will are coming
up this weekend together.

153
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,390
- But him and Will
aren't even friends.

154
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,630
Why is he coming here?

155
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,790
- 'Cause he's my friend
and I haven't seen him

156
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,200
in a long time.

157
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,800
- I don't want him
going into my room.

158
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,870
He's just gonna get drunk
and root through all my shit.

159
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,400
- It's not your room, Michael.

160
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,840
- You got any other
buddies coming, Dad?

161
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
You know, it's a good
thing we moved to this

162
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,180
new palatial estate so
now all your friends

163
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,710
can come visit us.

164
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,080
(chopping)

165
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,520
(heavy orchestral music)

166
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,000
(knocking)

167
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,500
- How are we supposed
to get inside,

168
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,340
if you're standing in the
middle of the doorway?

169
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,310
- Hey, Uncle.

170
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
- Good to see you, Michael.

171
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,340
Glad you're here.

172
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,580
- Glad to be back.

173
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,750
- How's it been so far?

174
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,650
- Well, I mean, it's
as good as it can be.

175
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,750
You want something to drink?

176
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,190
- Uh, no, thanks.

177
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,260
- Sergio?

178
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,060
- That's Mr. Guerrero to you.

179
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,360
Where's Rog?

180
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,690
- He's sleeping.

181
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,160
- This early?

182
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,970
- Everyone needs a nap
once in a while, Marx.

183
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,770
So, you gonna get him
up or just stand there?

184
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,780
- Dad (knocking), wake up.

185
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,250
Will and Sergio are here.

186
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,110
- Okay.

187
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,050
(door creaking)

188
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,250
- He should be out in a minute.

189
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,890
(clattering)

190
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,720
- Why don't you wake
up the whole mountain,

191
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,830
while you're at it?

192
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,090
- Lay off, man.

193
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,900
- [Sergio] Shut up
just once, Marx.

194
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,100
- You guys take
down the shelves?

195
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,570
- No, when we got here,
this place was wrecked.

196
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,570
Somebody took down the shelves

197
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,210
and the table was knocked over.

198
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,540
- Never had a problem with
vandals up here before.

199
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,880
- Yeah, they busted in
through the front door.

200
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,180
It won't even lock anymore.

201
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,450
(eerie music)

202
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,220
- If you don't tell me there
are hoodlums around here.

203
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,180
If they come back,
can't even keep 'em out.

204
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,750
- Calm down, I can fix the lock.

205
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,250
- I'll be a lot
calmer once we go,

206
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,190
get my guns out of the car.

207
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,960
- Guns, what do
we need guns for?

208
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,860
- So shit like this
doesn't happen.

209
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,930
- Okay, besides the mess, how
are you guys likin' the place?

210
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,400
- Uh, well, it's run on propane
and there isn't even radio.

211
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,270
I don't really know how
anyone could like it.

212
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,770
- Kids, never grateful
for what they got.

213
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,740
Always something
to complain about.

214
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,080
- Did your dad have a chance
to check out those places

215
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,480
in town I told him about?

216
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,810
- No.

217
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,150
He says he has to
fix this place up

218
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,180
before he can get a real job.
(door creaking)

219
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,990
- Hey Will, how's it going?

220
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,850
- Doin' good, Roger.

221
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,690
How you doin'?

222
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,890
- Can't complain.

223
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,390
- Dad, we'll need--

224
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,930
- Hey, who let a fuckin'
Mexican in here (laughing)?

225
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,760
- How's it goin'
you old bastard?

226
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,030
Long time no see, man.

227
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,000
- Where's your stuff?

228
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,830
- Left it out in the car.

229
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,800
- Ah, how's the family?

230
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,300
- Ah, you know how it is.

231
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,640
My last weekend with Marty,
the kid had the shits

232
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,500
like you wouldn't believe.

233
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,010
Didn't wanna stay inside either.

234
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,410
Cleanin' streams of that
stuff off the sidewalk.

235
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,080
So, I give him a
little what's for.

236
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,210
The fuckin' landlord
calls Child Services.

237
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,950
Can you believe that bullshit?

238
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,620
I got court with Sheila if
I wanna see that kid again.

239
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,750
- Who would have thought the
courts would look down on

240
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,650
child abuse like that?

241
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,860
It's a strange world.

242
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,490
- You can start talking
about raising kids

243
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,890
once you stop pumping
iron every wakin' second

244
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,660
and work on pumpin' some pussy.

245
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,930
- Okay, Sergio, I opened up
my second gym last month.

246
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,670
In my experience, success
is definitely something

247
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,130
women respond to.

248
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,640
Although I'm sure you know
all about that, right?

249
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,470
I'm sure they're just bustin'
down your door after seeing

250
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,010
your beefy list of debts.

251
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,510
- Hey, listen you dick--

252
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,810
- Hey, I'm not gonna listen
to this shit all weekend.

253
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,680
Just knock it off, you two.

254
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,810
- You mind if we take a
look around the property?

255
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,810
I wanna talk about a few things

256
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,120
before we get too distracted.

257
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,320
- Sure, just step outside.

258
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,990
(door creaking)

259
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,270
Everything looked good,
for the most part.

260
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,700
The place was busted
up when we got here.

261
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,700
- That's what Michael
was tellin' me.

262
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,910
We can always swing
by the Sheriff's

263
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,070
on the way back through town.

264
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,940
- Ah, it's not
that big of a deal.

265
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,310
With Michael and I both working,
we got it all cleaned up

266
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,350
and everything up and running.

267
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,280
- [Will] Glad to hear it.

268
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,180
Let's go check around back.

269
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,450
- [Roger] Sure.

270
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,050
(birds chirping)

271
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,630
- What the fuck is that?

272
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,890
- That's an outhouse.

273
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,530
There's no running
water up here.

274
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,930
- Fuck, Rog, I knew you had
it bad, but not this bad.

275
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,870
So, what's the story
with this place, Marx?

276
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,100
Family find it abandoned
and claim it for themselves?

277
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,970
- My grandfather
built this place.

278
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,270
We used to come up
here for vacations.

279
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,480
- [Sergio] I thought
my vacations were bad.

280
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,610
- Why didn't we
ever come here, Dad?

281
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,480
- Your mother didn't feel
like making the trip up

282
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,510
after your grandma died.

283
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,650
- It's too bad you didn't
spend a lot of time

284
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,420
up here, Michael.

285
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,950
Your mom really liked it
when she was your age.

286
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,960
She really loved the
outdoors, seeing nature.

287
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,390
- We all read the obituary,
Marx, no need to rehash it.

288
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,000
- Hey why don't you show
some respect, all right?

289
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,630
Shannon meant a lot to us.

290
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,500
- Relax, dude, it
was only a joke.

291
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,970
- Yeah, well, no one
thinks you're funny.

292
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,740
(sad piano music)

293
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,840
- [Will] You have enough wood?

294
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,840
- [Roger] I think so.

295
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
- All right, I guess all
that needs to be done

296
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,810
is to paint it and
build the porch

297
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,250
with the tools in the shed.

298
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,080
- [Roger] Yeah, it
shouldn't take me too long.

299
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,950
- How are you doing for work?

300
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,120
You been lookin'?

301
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,760
- Ah, no, but I figured since
I'm only fixin' things up

302
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,960
around here, I can be looking
for a job at the same time.

303
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,030
- Can we do something else now?

304
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,900
- Well, there's really
not that much to do.

305
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,040
- Are you kidding?

306
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,570
There's tons of great stuff.

307
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,070
In fact, there's supposed to
be a meteor shower tonight.

308
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,440
I figured we could find
a good spot and watch it.

309
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,270
- What?

310
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,710
No fuckin' way.

311
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,410
I brought booze.

312
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,250
Roger, why don't you
follow me down to the car,

313
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,110
help unload the goods?

314
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,120
Marx (fingers snapping),
toss me your keys.

315
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,820
- So, the plan for the
weekend is to get drunk?

316
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,030
- No, the plan for the
weekend is to relax, Michael.

317
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,870
(sad music)

318
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,370
- Come on, I'm sure
they're gonna wanna do more

319
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,140
than just drink beer.

320
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,310
(laughing)

321
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,340
- Oh man, usually I'm the
one doin' the fucking,

322
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,650
but that night, I got fucked.

323
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,650
(clattering)

324
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,490
(laughing)

325
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
- [Roger] Oh man.

326
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,060
I'm so glad you came
this weekend, man,

327
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,930
it's been too long since
I had a really good time.

328
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,260
- Man, it worked out.

329
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,360
You know I told you I
was in the area for work.

330
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,870
- Yeah.

331
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,870
- I'm actually with a logging
crew on this here mountain.

332
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,700
- No shit.

333
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,910
- Yeah.

334
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,140
We're clearing all
the woods around here

335
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,480
starting at the top,
working our way down.

336
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,150
Hey, Mikey.

337
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,550
(clattering)

338
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,180
Come here.

339
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,320
(muffled rock music)

340
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,260
You wanna beer?

341
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,230
- No thank you.

342
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,100
- Come on.

343
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,370
- Go ahead.

344
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,670
- See, your old man doesn't
care if you have a beer

345
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,170
and we won't let anyone
know you're under age.

346
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,140
- Even if I could
drink, I wouldn't.

347
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,010
- What's wrong with
your boy here, Rog?

348
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,280
How about some
(speaks in Spanish)?

349
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,220
I got it from this guy Darby.

350
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,290
Best shit in town.

351
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,220
- Get out of my face.

352
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,490
- Don't you fucking hit me.

353
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,830
- Well, I think Michael and I

354
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,440
might check out
that meteor shower.

355
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,700
- Fine with me.

356
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,270
We're gonna smoke
some of this shit.

357
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,810
We don't need any
little pussies around.

358
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,680
When you decide to grow a pair,

359
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,880
then you can sit
at the man's table.

360
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,480
Of course, I can't
remember the last time

361
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,290
a little bitch miraculously
grew balls (laughing).

362
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,290
- Go easy on the kid.

363
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,430
- All right, all
right, so sensitive.

364
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,970
(gentle piano music)

365
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,280
- [Michael] I knew
this was gonna happen.

366
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,550
- [Will] I know you don't
like to drink, Michael,

367
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,750
but your dad can
make his own choices.

368
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,620
- After the accident, he
said that that was it.

369
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,160
Clean living.

370
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,300
He wasn't gonna let alcohol
hurt our family anymore.

371
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,340
That lasted, what, three weeks?

372
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,210
- You have to understand, man,

373
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,510
he was married to
Shannon for 20 years.

374
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,420
That's a hard thing to get over.

375
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,880
- Yeah, it's terrible.

376
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,650
Now, who's gonna
make him dinner?

377
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,020
- I know he doesn't show
it, but I think deep down,

378
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,960
he feels the exact
same way you do.

379
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,660
- No, no, this is how
he's always wanted to act.

380
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,870
You know, she was preventing
him from being a lazy slob.

381
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,570
And now he has the perfect
excuse, "My wife's dead."

382
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,480
- I hadn't talked to
your dad in months

383
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,580
before he called
about the cabin.

384
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,190
Is it really that bad?

385
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,120
- My mom died in a hit-and-run.

386
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,820
My dad drank himself out of work

387
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,290
and out of our house.

388
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,260
- Look, hey, I'm sorry.

389
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,440
But today isn't how
it's always gonna be.

390
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,610
Have you looked at any colleges?

391
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,310
- Yeah, Dad says that
we can't afford college.

392
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,110
But that's okay,
'cause, you know,

393
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:54,880
I'll learn how to cook
grits and hogtie squirrel

394
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,420
and really that's all the
learnin' you need around here.

395
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,320
- You know, things have been
going really well with the gym.

396
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,430
I was thinking about
maybe asking your dad

397
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,590
about you moving in
with me for awhile.

398
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,800
There's schools around my place.

399
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,330
You can hang out with
kids your own age.

400
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,200
Maybe we can even set up a
student loan with my bank.

401
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,070
- Really?

402
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,640
- Yeah.

403
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,380
Like I know, I know that things

404
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,080
are never gonna be the same
now that your mom's gone.

405
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,220
But I want you to have as
normal of a life as possible.

406
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,920
- He'll never go for it.

407
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,130
- Won't know until we ask.

408
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,470
I'll ask him on
the trip tomorrow.

409
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,230
- What trip tomorrow?

410
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,440
- Your dad didn't tell you?

411
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,170
No, it's why Sergio
brought all those guns for.

412
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,910
It's huntin' season.

413
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,780
Sure he wants to shoot some
of the woodland creatures

414
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,740
before he has to leave.

415
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,550
- Great.

416
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,580
- If he's not killing
things one way,

417
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,880
he's just gonna do it another.

418
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,450
- What?

419
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,330
- Sergio's crew,

420
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,490
they're gonna be logging
a lot of the mountain

421
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,130
this side of Eight Canyons.

422
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,600
It's really gonna mess with
the wildlife around here.

423
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,100
You know that great job he
was telling your dad about?

424
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,000
- Yeah.

425
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,240
- It's bullshit.

426
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,570
They got him watching
the equipment at night.

427
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,840
Any jackass can do his job.

428
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,980
- So how'd he get
the weekend off?

429
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,580
- (laughing) He didn't.

430
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,920
His dealer's watching
it over the weekend.

431
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,950
Stupid asshole's been pulling
shit like this for decades.

432
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,250
- I can't believe you've
known him for that long.

433
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,790
I don't know how you stand it.

434
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,890
- You saw us back
at the cabin, right?

435
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,330
Well, I still can't stand it.

436
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,400
Whenever him and Roger
would come and visit Shannon

437
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,570
after school, he used
to just make it a point

438
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,200
just to poke at me.

439
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,610
I never thought
in a million years

440
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,440
I'd still be dealing
with him now.

441
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,580
- So, when's this thing
supposed to start?

442
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,520
- The guy said it should
start any time now.

443
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,620
- There it is.

444
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,100
- Rise and shine (smooching)!

445
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,340
(laughing)

446
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,770
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

447
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,140
- Hurry up and eat or we'll
leave your ass behind.

448
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,680
Come on, let's go.

449
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,340
Hey Rog, got more ammo?

450
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,140
- [Roger] Uh, all
I got is there.

451
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,550
You look like the
one who's hungover.

452
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,820
- Yeah, well it's hard to sleep

453
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,290
when you two won't
shut up all night.

454
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,390
You know, I don't really feel
like going out today, Dad.

455
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,660
I'm gonna stay.

456
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,290
- Come on, Michael.

457
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,890
You're complaining about there's
nothing to do around here,

458
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,800
so now we're finally
doing something.

459
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,300
- Okay, but can we do like,

460
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,540
like target practice
or something?

461
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,870
I just don't really understand
why we have to kill stuff.

462
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,280
- Hunting happens to be a
very fun sport, Michael.

463
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,240
You'll see.

464
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,280
Hurry up and eat.

465
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,910
We gotta get going.

466
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,290
(dark orchestral music)

467
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,250
- Roger, find us a
nice clear spot, yeah?

468
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,550
- There's a place
up ahead over there.

469
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,590
- All right.

470
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,410
(mumbling)

471
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,210
(sighing)

472
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,580
(crunching)

473
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,660
- Hey, give me an Oreo.

474
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,330
Okay.

475
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,660
(crunching)

476
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,430
(birds chirping)

477
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,740
- Roger, hold still.

478
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,610
- Guys.

479
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,480
Get down.

480
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,820
- That is a beauty.

481
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,030
- Who gets it?

482
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,670
- We'll let Michael
get the first shot.

483
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,270
- What am I supposed
to do with this?

484
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,270
- You're just gonna
shoot the deer.

485
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,740
- No, I don't wanna hunt.

486
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,440
- Come on, be a man.

487
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,950
- Do it for me, Michael.

488
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,450
- No, Dad, take the
gun, I don't want it.

489
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,550
- Nope, I'm not gonna take the
gun until you take the shot.

490
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,450
- You're really gonna
make him do something

491
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,620
he doesn't wanna do?

492
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,320
- Will, he's my son.

493
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,760
I think this will
be good for him.

494
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,620
- Dad...

495
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,700
- Your father's been looking
forward to this, Michael.

496
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,570
Now, stop being a
pussy and do it.

497
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,140
Don't touch me again.

498
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,540
- [Roger] Quiet guys,
you're gonna scare him away.

499
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,410
Come on.

500
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,210
Listen, you (mumbles)

501
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,880
Get it in the cross hairs.

502
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,090
You gotta let go of your
breath, then pull the trigger.

503
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,590
Pull.

504
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,660
(gun firing)

505
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,760
Ah, so close.

506
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,400
- How do you fuck that up?

507
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,930
Did you do that on purpose?

508
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:52,870
- What are you doing?

509
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,470
- I'm not gonna let it get away.

510
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,770
(heavy breathing)

511
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,910
- You know, Michael, something's
gonna kill it eventually.

512
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,650
- Yeah, but it
doesn't have to be me.

513
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,360
(snapping)

514
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,590
(yelling)

515
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,000
(eerie music)

516
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,170
(grunting)

517
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,470
(vomiting)

518
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:36,040
(ominous music)

519
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,790
(panting)

520
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,960
- Whoa, whoa, what
the, hey it's me.

521
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,830
What's wrong with you?

522
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,670
You look scared shitless.

523
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,900
The deer do that to you?

524
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,170
Those things can be
pretty ferocious.

525
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,470
(laughing)

526
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,910
(thudding)

527
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,780
- Let's take a
break for a minute.

528
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,390
- [Will] How many breaks are
we gonna take today, Sergio?

529
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,170
- What's that?

530
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,470
- I don't know.

531
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,670
- It almost looks
like hair from a bear,

532
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,140
but I've never seen
one around here.

533
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,440
(growling)

534
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,610
- Is it a bear?

535
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,990
- We have no bears around here.

536
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,820
- It's the woods.

537
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,320
Of course there's bears.

538
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,820
- You work on this
mountain, right?

539
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,830
Have you ever seen
a bear before?

540
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,990
- No.

541
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,630
- But what else makes
noise like that?

542
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,160
- I've never heard it before.

543
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,500
- It's gotta be a bear.

544
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,230
Maybe we should head back.

545
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,470
- I've never seen
a bear around here

546
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,370
and I've been up in this
area dozens of times.

547
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,140
- Roger, just because you
haven't seen something

548
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,240
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

549
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,740
- Even if it was a bear,
it's gonna keep its distance.

550
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,680
They're not gonna do anything
unless they're aggravated.

551
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,550
- You see, so let's
stick with the plan.

552
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,810
We'll set up camp soon.

553
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,020
We'll play it safe
from here on out.

554
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,380
- Well, I'm not
taking any chances.

555
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,880
- (chuckling) chances with what?

556
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,220
The nice trail?

557
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,090
- I gotta take a piss.

558
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,730
- Now he's gonna scream bear

559
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,430
every time he starts
acting like a dick.

560
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,730
Don't worry, we'll
be right here for you

561
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,430
when the bear gets
you, all right?

562
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,530
- [Sergio] One of these
days I'm gonna shut you up,

563
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,140
you little pissant.

564
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,920
- You want one?

565
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,950
- No thanks.

566
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,520
(birds cawing)

567
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,560
(crackling)

568
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,800
- Hey Will, remember that
thing we were gonna talk about?

569
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,780
- So yeah, Roger.

570
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,650
I wanna talk to you
about something.

571
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,850
(rustling)

572
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,750
- Guys!

573
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,490
(ominous music)

574
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,550
- What is it?

575
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,860
(rustling)

576
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,020
(gun firing)

577
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,430
Shit.

578
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,200
(dramatic music)

579
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
(gun firing)

580
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,370
(thudding)

581
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,570
(whimpering)

582
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,040
(heavy breathing)

583
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,480
- What are you doing?

584
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,110
- Watch it, man.

585
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,250
- What the fuck you shooting at?

586
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,080
- It's down there.

587
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,280
Do you see it?

588
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,320
- What was it?

589
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,290
- I don't know.

590
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,290
It's down there.

591
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,490
- Where down there?

592
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,920
- Down to the bushes.

593
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,890
- You hit something?

594
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,890
Was it a bear?

595
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,930
- No, it wasn't a bear.

596
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,230
This was huge.

597
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,560
- Have you ever seen a
full-size bear before?

598
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,530
- Not up close.

599
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,800
- Well, then you don't know

600
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,770
they can stand up
to seven feet tall.

601
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,230
- No, no, no, this was bigger.

602
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,200
- Everything looks bigger
when you're scared.

603
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,070
The point is, did you kill it?

604
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,340
- [Sergio] It don't think so.

605
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,640
- Well, then we
need to find out.

606
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,870
- Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,480
- Just stay up there
with Michael, all right?

608
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,640
I need to check this out.

609
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,180
- Be careful, Dad.

610
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,580
- I don't see anything.

611
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,990
- We gotta get out of here, man.

612
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,550
That thing is still out there.

613
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,490
- What are we gonna do?

614
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,020
- There's nothing down there.

615
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,160
- There was.

616
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,590
- Well then, it's invisible.

617
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,560
All right, can you
wait to go crazy

618
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,660
until after this weekend?

619
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,370
- What's going on, Sergio?

620
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,670
- I don't know.

621
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,110
I thought I saw...

622
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,310
- It'll be okay.

623
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,710
Let's just get
back on the trail.

624
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,020
We should set up camp.

625
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,860
We're all tired and--

626
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,230
- Imagining things?

627
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,160
- And it's getting dark,
so let's find a nice place

628
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,560
up ahead and relax.

629
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,070
- We should head
back to the cabin.

630
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,370
It's not that far back.

631
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,200
- Maybe he's right.

632
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,640
We can't sleep out
here with a hurt bear.

633
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,770
- We've already concluded
that there aren't any bears.

634
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,440
So, Sergio freaked out and
shot a bush, who hasn't?

635
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,510
But, some of us should
stop overreacting

636
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,550
and start growing a pair.

637
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,650
- You don't know what I saw.

638
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,250
- Knock it off you two.

639
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,680
We're all sane adults here.

640
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,690
Let's just act like it.

641
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,060
- So, we're still
camping for the night?

642
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,390
- Come on.

643
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,670
- Come on, Michael.

644
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,600
We'll find a good spot.

645
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,180
(dramatic music)

646
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,450
(growling)

647
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,590
- [Roger] This looks good.

648
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,500
- [Will] We're
gonna need firewood.

649
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,940
- [Roger] Michael, can
you go get us some wood?

650
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,310
- Yeah, I guess.

651
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,040
Shouldn't we wait until
the tent's set up?

652
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,880
- There is no tent.

653
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,250
- [Michael] What?

654
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,680
What's gonna keep
the animals out?

655
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,380
- [Sergio] Oh Jesus, we
should have brought the tent.

656
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,450
- There is no tent and
nothing's gonna bother us.

657
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,720
- But Dad--

658
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,990
- Michael, you're
just gonna have to

659
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,920
get comfortable on
the ground, okay?

660
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,190
So, please go get the wood.

661
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,740
(ominous music)

662
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,090
(snapping)

663
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,710
(snapping)

664
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,150
(drumming)

665
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,820
- [Michael] Jesus Christ.

666
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,720
- Don't go all
Sergio on me, man.

667
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,590
Come on.

668
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,870
(fire crackling)

669
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,150
(howling)

670
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,190
- Calm down, will ya?

671
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,120
- What's got you so freaked?

672
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,390
- I don't know.

673
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,560
It's about three
feet taller than me,

674
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:15,230
completely covered in hair.

675
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,700
I'd never seen anything
like that before.

676
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,170
- Maybe it was Sasquatch.

677
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,040
- Don't be ridiculous.

678
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,070
Come on.

679
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,540
- I don't know what
else it could have been.

680
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,080
- Are you serious?

681
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,250
You think you shot
at a Big Foot?

682
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,510
- No, he's not serious.

683
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,380
He's being very
stupid right now.

684
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,550
- No, that's the only
explanation that makes sense.

685
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,690
- That's the only
explanation that makes sense?

686
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,890
- That thing is still out there.

687
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,160
And there are
probably more of them.

688
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,490
We gotta go back.

689
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,330
- Calm down, man.

690
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,030
Just relax, all right?

691
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,570
There's no such
thing as Big Foot.

692
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,530
- I don't know,
I've heard stories.

693
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,840
- [Sergio] What stories?

694
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:55,970
- Knock it off, Will.

695
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,670
- What did you hear?

696
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:04,250
- Stories of strange things
being seen in the woods.

697
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,980
I heard them when I was a kid.

698
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,410
There's even one about
a group of miners

699
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,620
that were attacked on
this very mountain.

700
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,490
- Will, this isn't funny.

701
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,420
- Keep going.

702
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,020
- Now, it's gonna scare Michael.

703
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,490
- I'm not scared.

704
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,060
Go ahead, Will.

705
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,090
- All right.

706
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,330
It happened about 90 years ago.

707
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,430
There was a group of miners
working on this mountain.

708
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,200
One night, they were
attacked in their cabin.

709
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,410
Rocks, they fell
from the hilltops.

710
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,640
The sides of the cabin

711
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,740
they were just being
shaken violently.

712
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,280
The attacks happened throughout
the rest of the night.

713
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,290
At one point, one of
the men ventured outside

714
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,820
and went around back, was
knocked unconscious by a rock.

715
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,130
And when he came to,
everyone was gone.

716
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,200
But there were these big
footprints all around the cabin.

717
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:05,040
Ever since then people
referred to it as Ape Canyon.

718
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,680
It's only a few miles away.

719
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,580
Pretty short walk for
our friend Mr. Sasquatch.

720
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:14,450
- [Sergio] That's true?

721
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,750
- No, it's not true.

722
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,590
He's yanking your dick, man.

723
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,850
- [Sergio] We shouldn't be here.

724
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,220
- Come on, Sergio.

725
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,760
Even if Big Foot did exist,

726
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,960
he's not gonna attack
people, all right?

727
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,830
He's friendly like ET.

728
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,530
- I don't know, Dad.

729
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,170
Maybe he felt threatened.

730
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,470
- Michael, shut up, all right?

731
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,770
This stops right now.

732
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,770
- No, we gotta
stay alert tonight.

733
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:41,180
What if they come back for us?

734
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,380
- Don't worry, all right?

735
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,510
We got our guns,
you got your knife,

736
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,150
Michael's afraid of
every sound he hears.

737
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,750
I mean, that's a pretty
good security system.

738
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,820
All we have to do is hang
the food up in the tree

739
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,050
then nothing has any
reason to bother us.

740
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:54,920
- Yeah.

741
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,790
Okay.

742
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,370
(eerie music)

743
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,550
(crackling)

744
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:30,120
(drumming music)

745
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,830
(crackling)

746
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,100
(heavy breathing)

747
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,240
(low growling)

748
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,580
(screaming)

749
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,020
(gun firing)

750
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,320
- What the hell's going on?

751
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,490
- [Sergio] It's the Big Foot.

752
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,390
I told you it would
come after me.

753
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,590
- Fuck, Sergio, come back.

754
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,560
Stay here with him.

755
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,170
- Did you see anything?

756
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,800
- Sergio was right.

757
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,940
It was Big Foot.

758
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,210
- What?

759
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,640
No, damn it, Michael,
that's the story I saw

760
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,880
on Unsolved Mysteries.

761
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,010
- I saw it, Will.

762
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,380
Someone's, someone's been here.

763
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,880
- Oh, God, Sergio's crazy
ass must have scared him off.

764
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,420
Come on, we gotta go find 'em.

765
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,290
(generator humming)

766
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,730
- [Sergio] Darby!

767
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:40,760
Darby!

768
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,130
Darby.

769
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,400
- [Roger] What's
going on, Sergio?

770
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,230
- [Sergio] Darby's
supposed to be here.

771
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:47,200
- Who the hell is Darby?

772
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,640
- This guy from the town.

773
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,300
I had him watching the
equipment for me this weekend.

774
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,510
- [Will] He said
it was his dealer.

775
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,640
- [Roger] Fuck.

776
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,080
Did you tell him
we'd be camping?

777
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,540
- [Sergio] Well, yeah.

778
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,680
- [Roger] Don't you see
what's going on here?

779
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,910
He's the one from
back at the campsite.

780
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,850
He was trying to steal our shit.

781
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,820
And he might have been the
one that fucked up the cabin.

782
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:05,850
- [Sergio] No, no, no, no, no.

783
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:06,690
They were here.

784
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,690
(dramatic music)

785
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,390
They killed him.

786
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,990
All that blood.

787
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,500
- [Roger] What the hell
are you talking about?

788
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,530
I'm gonna go find this guy
and put an end to this.

789
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,030
- [Michael] Dad.

790
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,630
- [Roger] Stay with your uncle.

791
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,340
There's no one here.

792
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,270
- [Sergio] He got him.

793
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,270
- [Roger] Enough of that.

794
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,150
(eerie music)

795
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,580
Hey, who's there?

796
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,460
(screaming)

797
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,290
- [Will] Oh my God.

798
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,660
- [Michael] Dad.

799
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,390
- [Roger] Help me.

800
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,760
- [Michael] Dad.

801
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,300
(dramatic drumming music)

802
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,000
- [Roger] Help me.

803
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,510
- Dad!

804
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,310
Dad!

805
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,140
- No.

806
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:01,980
What was that?

807
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,180
- That was Big Foot.

808
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,450
It won't stop until
it kills us all.

809
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,510
- Sergio, for fuck sake,
someone just took Roger.

810
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,780
We gotta find him.

811
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,520
- NO, no, fuck you, I'm
going back to the cabin.

812
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,620
- Come back here, coward.

813
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,560
Come on, we gotta
go find your dad.

814
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,130
- I saw it.

815
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,230
I really did and
it's gonna kill him.

816
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,600
- All right, I know
you're scared, Michael.

817
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,970
But someone's gotta help him.

818
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,010
And right now that's us.

819
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,110
- I can't.

820
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,420
- Okay, okay.

821
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,550
Let's figure out what to do
back at the cabin, all right?

822
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,460
All right?

823
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,920
Come on, come on!

824
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,480
(footsteps plodding)

825
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,340
(heavy breathing)

826
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,750
- It couldn't have
gotten in front of--

827
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,220
- There's more than one.

828
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,050
(cracking)

829
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:19,890
Shit!

830
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,690
(dramatic music)

831
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:28,330
(growling)

832
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,870
- [Will] Come on, Michael.

833
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,810
(heavy breathing)

834
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,010
- [Michael] You got us lost.

835
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,640
- [Sergio] I think
it's this way.

836
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,050
Let's just keep moving.

837
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,910
(heavy breathing)

838
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,520
(gasping)

839
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,690
(crackling)

840
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,250
(drumming music)

841
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,190
(clattering)

842
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,790
- [Will] Open up this
(mumbles), you son of a bitch.

843
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,590
(heavy breathing)

844
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,460
(door clattering)

845
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,330
(heavy breathing)

846
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,800
(clicking)

847
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,440
- Shit, we left
the packs outside.

848
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,210
- My dad's still out there.

849
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,210
- The extra ammo's in the packs.

850
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,720
- I thought he was your friend.

851
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,080
- Well, that doesn't
matter any more, Michael,

852
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,190
because he's dead
and we will be too

853
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,720
without any fucking ammo.

854
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,720
- Then why don't you
go get it, Sergio?

855
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,760
Okay, and hopefully we'll
remember to let you back in.

856
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,860
(punching)

857
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,090
(grunting)

858
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,030
- What the fuck is
the matter with you?

859
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,400
You don't fucking touch him.

860
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,530
- Stay back, Mother Fucker.

861
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,170
I'm tired of listening
to your shit.

862
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,670
- My shit?

863
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,170
You're the one crying about
coming back to this cabin

864
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,270
as soon as possible and now
you're gonna bitch about,

865
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,570
what, not having bullets?

866
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,440
- Guys.

867
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,310
Well, what are we gonna do?

868
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,280
- We stay here.

869
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,710
- What?

870
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,750
- Yeah, and we got an advantage
over those things outside

871
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,450
as long as we stay in the cabin.

872
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,720
- But, what are we
gonna do about my dad?

873
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,950
- Yeah, we have to find Roger.

874
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,020
- You don't have any
idea where he is.

875
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,690
- Then we, we take the cars.

876
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,120
We go back to town, we
come back with the cops.

877
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,290
Michael, I need the truck keys.

878
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:43,030
- I think my dad has them.

879
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,900
- Oh shit.

880
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,530
- Sergio (fingers
snapping), keys.

881
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,070
We need to find Roger.

882
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,800
Who knows what those crazy
fuckers are doing to him.

883
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,070
- Oh man, Roger's dead.

884
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,240
He's being ripped apart
by Big Foot as we speak.

885
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,410
- I'm tired of your bullshit.

886
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,610
You're gonna give me those keys,

887
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,810
or do I have to
take them from you?

888
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,780
- Back off!

889
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,120
(eerie music)

890
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:07,620
- You wanna stay here?

891
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,490
Fine.

892
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,320
We'll take a car.

893
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,860
We'll come back with help.

894
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,360
- You'll lead 'em back here,
you'll lead 'em back to me.

895
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:15,330
- Give me the keys!

896
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,160
(punching)

897
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,000
(grunting)

898
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,830
(slashing)

899
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,130
(grunting)

900
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,440
(slashing)

901
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,180
- [Will] Oh God.

902
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,120
(clattering)

903
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:43,020
(heavy breathing)

904
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,770
(eerie music)

905
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,680
- You killed him.

906
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,420
- I gotta get rid of him.

907
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,060
I can't have him staring
at me all night long.

908
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
Pick him up.

909
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,390
- What?

910
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:25,530
- You're gonna move the
body, put him in your room.

911
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:26,400
- No.

912
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:36,040
- Stop fucking looking at me!

913
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,640
Fuck you, fuck you.

914
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,210
(clacking)

915
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,510
(grunting)

916
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,860
(clattering)

917
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,570
(crying)

918
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,050
(clattering)

919
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,160
(heavy breathing)

920
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,840
(door creaking)

921
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,460
(thudding)

922
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:05,990
(gasping)

923
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:06,860
- Oh shit!

924
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,130
(heavy breathing)

925
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,230
- Help me.

926
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,470
- úWhat do you want?

927
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,600
- Look, my name is Bauman.

928
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,240
I haven't eaten in days.

929
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:21,540
Please help me.

930
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:24,740
- Okay.

931
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,450
Sit down.

932
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:31,620
And put your hands on
the table and don't move.

933
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,660
- Okay.

934
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,760
Thank you.

935
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,030
Thank you.

936
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,090
- Oh Jesus, what's
happened to you?

937
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,500
- I was kidnapped.

938
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,270
I don't know if they're
still after me or not.

939
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,540
- The Big Foot?

940
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,980
It took my dad tonight.

941
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,380
Okay, you, you have to tell
me what happened to you

942
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,580
so I can try and find him.

943
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,550
- All right.

944
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:47,890
For years, I'd heard a
story about a lost gold mine

945
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:50,260
out in these mountains.

946
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,130
When I heard they were
gonna start logging,

947
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,770
I knew somebody would
find it eventually.

948
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,300
I needed the money, so
I scrounged together

949
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:01,440
whatever I could, made my
way out to the mountains.

950
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:06,010
That night, started to hear
strange noises in the trees.

951
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,080
I found an abandoned campsite.

952
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,420
That's where it happened.

953
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,690
(growling)

954
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,790
(footsteps plodding)

955
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,790
But when I couldn't
escape its grasp,

956
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,090
it carried me for
what felt like hours.

957
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,860
(growling)

958
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,360
(grunting)

959
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,330
(growling)

960
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,530
(yelling)

961
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,440
(pounding)

962
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,780
(grunting)

963
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,990
(heavy breathing)

964
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,190
- Oh, no!

965
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,250
No!

966
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,120
No, no!

967
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,430
(grunting)

968
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,570
(eerie music)

969
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,800
(heavy breathing)

970
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,100
(chirping)

971
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,470
(crunching)

972
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,850
(shouting)

973
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,480
(growling)

974
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,490
(screaming)

975
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:00,860
I saw three of 'em in that cave.

976
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:02,530
Could have been more.

977
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,630
I don't know.

978
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,800
I didn't try to move again
until the sun came up.

979
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,350
(heavy breathing)

980
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,040
(rocks clattering)

981
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:56,880
(growling)

982
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:01,990
(pounding)

983
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,930
I'm not sure why they
didn't try to kill me.

984
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,130
Maybe I wasn't a threat.

985
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,360
Maybe they didn't
want me to escape

986
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,500
and bring back more
people, I don't know.

987
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,300
I sat there for

988
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,170
I don't know how long.

989
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:24,480
Watching 'em go
about their routine.

990
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,280
Then two of them left.

991
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,560
That left me with just the one.

992
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:41,760
I knew if I was ever gonna
escape, it had to be now.

993
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,430
I didn't have anything
to use as a weapon on me.

994
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,800
But I did have some tobacco.

995
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,140
- Hey.

996
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,040
Hey Boogie Man.

997
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:09,020
Mmm.

998
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,460
Good.

999
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:14,960
Want some?

1000
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,170
(grunting)

1001
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:29,440
(slobbering)

1002
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,740
(growling)

1003
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,960
(thudding)

1004
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,730
(dramatic music)

1005
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:53,330
(thudding)
(grunting)

1006
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:05,410
(dramatic drumming music)

1007
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:17,620
I had no idea where
I was so I just ran.

1008
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,830
I don't know for how long.

1009
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:23,600
(heavy breathing)

1010
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,400
Then eventually
I saw your cabin.

1011
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,740
- But, where's the cave?

1012
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,480
Okay, you have to tell
me where the cave is

1013
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,350
'cause that's where
they're holding my dad.

1014
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,550
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

1015
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,180
When I got out of there, I
just ran in whatever direction

1016
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,390
I was pointed.

1017
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:52,290
Hey, was that an
outhouse I saw out back?

1018
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,230
- Yeah.

1019
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,770
- You got a gun or anything?

1020
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:05,510
- No.

1021
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,080
- Will you come with me?

1022
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:16,520
You can keep an eye out.

1023
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:20,050
We gotta watch
each other's backs.

1024
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:20,920
- Okay.

1025
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,310
(ominous music)

1026
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,290
(crunching)

1027
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,300
- Hey.

1028
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,270
Can I have that?

1029
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,870
- I thought I was
watchin' your back?

1030
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,910
- I don't like the dark.

1031
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,210
(grunting)

1032
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:25,890
- Okay.

1033
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,530
(shouting)

1034
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,530
(grunting)

1035
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,460
- Dad, Dad, what happened?

1036
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,800
- [Bauman] Oh shit.

1037
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:43,100
(grunting)

1038
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,110
- Oh.

1039
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,070
- Are you okay?

1040
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:50,710
(grunting)

1041
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,040
Are you okay?

1042
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,580
- It pulled me into the woods.

1043
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,580
They beat me.

1044
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,790
It messed up my leg.

1045
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,030
I had to play dead before
it would (mumbles).

1046
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,560
- What happened to your gun?

1047
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:12,770
- (mumbles) outside
before I saw you.

1048
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:16,500
- We're gonna need that gun if
those things come back here.

1049
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,370
(heavy breathing)

1050
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,670
(grunting)

1051
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:35,720
- Ah.

1052
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,390
Thank God you're okay.

1053
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,270
And who the hell was that guy?

1054
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,130
- That's Bauman.

1055
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,270
The Big Foot had him too.

1056
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,910
- Where's everyone else?

1057
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,920
- Will and Sergio were arguing

1058
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,130
over whether we should stay here

1059
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,390
or we should go

1060
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,560
and Will tried to
take his keys back

1061
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:22,570
and Sergio stabbed him.

1062
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:26,070
- Oh my God.

1063
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:31,680
- And it's my fault because
Will wanted to go and find you

1064
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:35,820
and I told him not to
because I was too scared.

1065
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,280
And now it's my
fault that he's dead.

1066
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,490
- No, no, what happened was
not your fault, Michael.

1067
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,260
I would have told Will to do

1068
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:47,860
the same exact thing if I could.

1069
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:52,900
The entire time I was out there,

1070
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:55,270
I prayed that you were safe.

1071
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,740
Where's Sergio now?

1072
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,010
- I knocked him out
and put him in my room

1073
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,450
with Will's body.

1074
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,490
- Well, we'll just
leave him in there then.

1075
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,360
When Bauman gets
back, we're gonna go

1076
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:20,890
and we're gonna get some help.

1077
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,000
- Okay.

1078
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,700
Do you think we can
make it to the car?

1079
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,330
- We got no choice.

1080
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,200
Where are my keys?

1081
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,470
- I don't know.

1082
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:40,610
- I must have dropped
them in the shed.

1083
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,320
(grunting)

1084
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,820
- [Michael] Come on, come on.

1085
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,050
- I can't go.

1086
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,320
- We're gonna get
the key and the gun

1087
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,190
and we're gonna get the
fuck out of here, okay?

1088
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,090
- Oh my God, they followed me.

1089
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:55,860
(dramatic music)

1090
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,300
(gun firing)

1091
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,600
(yelling)

1092
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,440
(growling)

1093
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,710
(clicking)

1094
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:10,180
(growling)

1095
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:16,720
(screaming)

1096
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,080
(screaming)

1097
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,260
(growling)

1098
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:25,630
(screaming)

1099
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:29,530
(cracking)

1100
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,900
(screaming)

1101
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,740
(grunting)

1102
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:48,480
(clacking)

1103
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,120
(gun firing)

1104
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,260
(thudding)

1105
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,070
(growling)

1106
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:06,900
- What are you doing?

1107
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,500
He's still out there.

1108
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,170
- I'm sorry, Michael, he's dead.

1109
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,670
We have to look out
for each other now.

1110
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,310
- But it left.

1111
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:18,140
- We don't know where to.

1112
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,750
We have to be smart
about this, Michael,

1113
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,310
or we may not last
through the night.

1114
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,580
(thudding)

1115
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:28,750
What was that?

1116
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:31,790
(heaving breathing)

1117
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:36,900
(door creaking)

1118
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,710
(door creaking)

1119
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,150
(thudding)

1120
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:05,090
(glass shattering)

1121
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,030
(grunting)

1122
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:06,990
Stay down.

1123
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,260
(thudding)

1124
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,700
(clattering)

1125
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,470
Shit.

1126
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,520
- Think they thrown a rock?

1127
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,260
(crunching)

1128
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:40,130
(heavy breathing)

1129
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,670
(crunching)

1130
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,700
(heavy breathing)

1131
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,640
What is it?

1132
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,640
- They're leaving.

1133
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:58,110
- Well, then we
should leave too.

1134
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,150
(footsteps plodding)

1135
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,820
(creaking)

1136
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,790
(glass shattering)

1137
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,720
- Pay back time, you bastards.

1138
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,420
(gun firing)

1139
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,260
Michael, grab a gun, help me.

1140
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:15,830
- It's locked in the
room with Sergio.

1141
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,230
(crashing)

1142
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,100
- Oh shit!

1143
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:22,200
(gun firing)

1144
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,900
(dramatic drumming music)

1145
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:26,710
(heavy breathing)

1146
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,310
(low creaking)

1147
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,710
- What are they doing?

1148
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:36,580
- It sounds like they're
pushing on the walls.

1149
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,160
(clattering)

1150
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,290
- Over there.

1151
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,230
(gun firing)

1152
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,160
(dramatic music)

1153
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,630
(growling)

1154
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,470
- Dad!

1155
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,300
(yelling)

1156
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,100
(thudding)

1157
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:56,940
(grunting)

1158
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:57,770
- Come on.

1159
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,700
Gotta block the window.

1160
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:02,570
Are you okay?

1161
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:03,710
- Yeah.

1162
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,710
(creaking)

1163
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,110
- They're on the roof.

1164
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,210
Get down.

1165
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,480
(clicking)

1166
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,750

1167
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,390
(gun firing)

1168
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,530
(gun firing)

1169
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,130
(gun firing)

1170
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:30,440
(creaking)

1171
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,270
- Did you get it?

1172
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,010
(crashing)

1173
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,810
(dramatic music)

1174
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,450
(slashing)

1175
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,710
(growling)

1176
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,550
(slashing)

1177
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:44,750
(growling)

1178
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:46,420
(slashing)

1179
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:48,090
(grunting)

1180
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,290
(roaring)

1181
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,690
(growling)

1182
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,600
(grunting)

1183
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,100
- [Roger] Grab the
dresser from your room.

1184
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,570
We can use it to hold the door.

1185
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,840
- Sergio's in there.

1186
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:04,770
- We don't have a choice.

1187
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,170
We can't hold this ourselves.

1188
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:07,540
Go!

1189
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:09,840
(grunting)

1190
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,480
(shouting)

1191
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,390
- You need something, Michael?

1192
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,300
(grunting)

1193
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,130
- [Roger] Michael, hurry!

1194
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:34,430
- Rog?

1195
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:36,300
(grunting)

1196
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,170
Come on.

1197
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:39,500
(shouting)

1198
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,940
(roaring)

1199
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:43,210
(grunting)

1200
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,410
(crashing)

1201
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,750
(gun firing)

1202
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,560
- Thanks.

1203
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,160
- Yeah, no problem.

1204
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,670
- We gotta get to the cars.

1205
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:11,700
- No way.

1206
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,410
Those things are
still out there.

1207
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,810
You want them to kill us all?

1208
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,080
- Okay, maybe you're right.

1209
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,910
- If we're gonna stay here,

1210
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,020
then we need to
block these windows.

1211
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,050
- With what?

1212
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,890
- With the wood for the deck.

1213
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,130
With the wood for the deck

1214
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:36,900
that's in the shed.

1215
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,970
- Yeah, he's right, Sergio.

1216
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,500
If we can get that stuff,

1217
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,940
we can keep these
bastards out for good.

1218
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:48,410
- I'm not going out there.

1219
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,410
The cabin is the only
place we're gonna be safe.

1220
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,080
- Well, they're hurt pretty bad,

1221
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:55,150
we got all the main
entrances blocked.

1222
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,180
And we don't hear them
outside anymore, do you?

1223
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,520
Maybe they're
regrouping in the trees.

1224
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:03,160
We can't secure this cabin
unless we get that wood.

1225
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:04,920
- Well, I'm not leaving.

1226
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,960
And you're gonna go out
there with that bad leg?

1227
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,030
Well, are you?

1228
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:09,890
- I'll go.

1229
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:14,770
- Are you sure?

1230
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,140
- Sergio's right.

1231
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,310
We have to stay here.

1232
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:28,550
Okay, which means
that the only option

1233
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,850
is to lock this place down.

1234
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,820
- Well, you can take
your daddy's rifle.

1235
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:38,290
I'm keeping mine right close.

1236
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,360
- Take it.

1237
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:45,860
- No, because I need to have
my hands free to carry stuff.

1238
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:46,730
Okay?

1239
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:51,670
But that means I'm gonna need
one of you in that window.

1240
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:52,940
- I'll cover you.

1241
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:54,140
- Thanks, Dad.

1242
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:58,310
Okay, let's use my window.

1243
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,340
- All right.

1244
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:03,520
Well, no time like the present.

1245
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,460
(clattering)

1246
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:29,070
- Be careful.

1247
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:31,040
- Don't worry, we will.

1248
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:37,680
(heavy breathing)

1249
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,450
(grunting)

1250
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:45,320
(heavy breathing)

1251
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:04,510
(eerie music)

1252
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:32,270
(footsteps pounding)

1253
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,080
(heavy breathing)

1254
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,200
(clattering)

1255
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:10,780
(yelling)

1256
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,650
(drumming music)

1257
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,520
(heavy breathing)

1258
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:22,250
(crunching)

1259
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,620
- [Roger] Oh no.

1260
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:26,860
Michael, look out.

1261
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:27,790
(crashing)

1262
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:30,130
- [Michael] No, don't shoot.

1263
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,030
(growling)

1264
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,630
Dad, open the door.

1265
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,400
- Sergio.

1266
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,240
- Yeah?

1267
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:37,070
- I need your help.

1268
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,270
Get on the dresser.

1269
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,910
We just need to
make a distraction.

1270
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:41,940
- All right.

1271
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,310
(glass shattering)

1272
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,150

1273
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,010
Jesus!

(crunching)

1277
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,820
- You don't hurt
my family, Sergio.

1278
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:57,420
(coughing)

1279
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:58,260

1281
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,590
(tapping) Hey, over here.

1282
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:03,860
This is the one you want.

1283
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,300
(gun firing)

1284
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,630

1287
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:16,440
- [Sergio] Roger!

1288
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,280
(growling)

1289
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:18,210
(crunching)

1290
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,410
(yelling)

1291
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:24,650
(squirting)

1292
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,780

1293
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:26,620
(knocking)

1294
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,990
- [Michael] Dad!

1295
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:31,490
- Thank God.

1296
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,300
Never been more afraid
in my whole life.

1297
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,260
You got the key?

1298
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,900
- Yeah.

1299
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:40,630
Where's Sergio?

1300
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:42,100
- He got what's coming to him.

1301
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:44,300
Now, let's get the
hell out of here.

1302
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,670
(crunching)

1303
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,910
Stay right here.

1304
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:55,210
(door creaking)

1305
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:02,650

1306
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:03,690
Get the gun.

1307
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:08,430
Go.

1308
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:14,100

(grunting)

1311
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,970
I won't be able to
make it on my leg.

1312
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,180
Just go.

1313
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:25,110
- I'm not gonna
leave you here, Dad

1314
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:25,780
Come on, come on, come on.

1315
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:27,950
(grunting)

1316
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:30,350
Oh no.

1321
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:53,870
Where'd he go?

1322
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,940
Come on.

1323
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,340

1335
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,600
- [Roger] Go.

1336
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:52,330
Get to the car.

Give me the key.

(grunting)

1341
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,850

(growling)

1343
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,760

1344
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:21,460
(grunting)

1345
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,790
Dad!

We're leaving and
we're not coming back.

Okay, you're gonna be okay.

1364
