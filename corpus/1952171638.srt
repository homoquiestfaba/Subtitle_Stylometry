1
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:05,838
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

2
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:09,875
for the Comedy Hall's
very own Michael Borland.

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:10,509
(applause)

4
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,945
Look, look, the Kennedys
killed Marilyn Monroe.

5
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,614
I'm pretty sure the gunman
in the grassy knoll

6
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:18,384
was either Arthur Miller
or Joe DiMaggio.

7
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:19,385
"Bang my wife, will ya?"

8
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,619
(imitates gunshot)

9
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,388
(laughing)

10
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:24,857
"Hey, if you'd have me,
I'd ask you to marry me.

11
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:27,359
Hell, somebody's got
to clean my apartment."

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,060
Hey, how many of you people

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,362
know the theme
to
Gilligan's Island?

14
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:31,196
(applause)
All right.

15
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:33,665
Now, how many of you can recite
the Bill of Rights?

16
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:34,633
That's-that's-that's...

17
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,403
Who cares?
It's really not that important.

18
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:38,871
We don't use it anymore.

19
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:42,204
(mumbling)

20
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,145
(laughing)

21
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:47,379
I hear a lot of folks saying,

22
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,914
"You know, if it wasn't
for the US,

23
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:51,116
the, uh, French would be
speaking German."

24
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:53,919
(mild applause)

25
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,422
Yeah, well, if it,
if it wasn't for the French,

26
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:58,982
you'd be speaking Cherokee.

27
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:01,460
Get off the stage!

28
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,395
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I hurt your brains?

29
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:04,696
"That's my time, everybody.

30
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:05,464
"Tip for the night:

31
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:07,399
If you don't know
what you're doing,

32
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,233
"don't do it harder.

33
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,501
Good night, everybody!"

34
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:10,569
(laughing)

35
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,938
Zip me up.

36
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:15,641
(sighs)

37
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,443
Anything else?

38
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:18,010
Yeah. Laugh.

39
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,614
It recently came out that
Jesus could've had siblings.

40
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:25,451
Could you imagine growing up
having Jesus in your family?

41
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,920
"Why can't you be
more like your brother?"

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,620
What's up, dude?

43
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,090
"Uh, 'cause he's the Messiah.
He's the son of God."

44
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,124
Hi, ladies. All right.

45
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,725
"When your brother's home,

46
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,260
we always have wine."

47
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,463
Caught your act
on the tube
last night.

48
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,430
You knocked
them out.

49
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,465
I had to turn up
the volume,

50
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:40,432
I was laughing
so loud.

51
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:41,200
This art exhibit get any laughs?

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,435
Hey, come on, you're
my only headliner,
you know that.

53
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:47,599
Well, I'm Michael Borland,
and that's my time...

54
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,676
and that's your silence.

55
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:51,710
All right, now,
ladies and gentlemen,

56
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,745
let me introduce you to your
headliner this evening...

57
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:55,247
(loud cheering,
rock theme plays)

58
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,715
...a man I'm sure you know

59
00:01:56,715 --> 00:02:01,487
from his hit TV show,
Dougie to the Max,

60
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:02,688
Mr. Dougie Max!

61
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,990
(cheering and applause)

62
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,724
Save me.

63
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,193
Remember when I used
to open for you?

64
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:11,526
(rock theme playing)

65
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,728
What's up, Vegas?

66
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:20,962
(cheering and applause)

67
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:26,512
(cheering and groaning)

68
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:29,515
Hey, kid, it's a cruel world.

69
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:32,712
(cheering and applause)

70
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,020
Ain't it great? Bam!

71
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,255
Welcome to The Tragedy Hall.

72
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:40,559
Hey, you hear the one about
the comedian who died onstage?

73
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,027
Literally.
Bah-dum-bum.

74
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:43,095
I'll be here all week.

75
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,564
Maybe he slipped
on a banana peel.

76
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:46,999
Bah-dum-bum.
Hmm.

77
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,302
Crowd thought
it was part of his act...

78
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,037
till he didn't get up.

79
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,272
Hi, David.

80
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:55,672
Hey, Catherine.

81
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,278
Well, there's no foam
on the mouth.

82
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:03,182
No discoloration
around the lips.

83
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,516
Pupils aren't dilated.

84
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,319
No overt evidence
of a drug overdose.

85
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,520
When was the last time

86
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,023
a comedian died
of natural causes?

87
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,257
Clenched fist...

88
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,358
classic Levine sign.

89
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,294
He's awfully young
for a heart attack.

90
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:17,196
Well, live fast,
die young...

91
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,031
I forget the rest.
Excuse me!

92
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,166
Could someone turn down
the house lights,

93
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,035
and turn up the stage lights?

94
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,369
Thank you.

95
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:29,671
I want to see what
he
saw...
right before he died.

96
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,678
What do you see?

97
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:34,846
Nothing.

98
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:36,348
What are you looking for?

99
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,217
A punchline?

100
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,775
Bah-dum-bum.

110
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:16,246
(garbled radio transmission)

111
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:18,123
See, here's a switch.

112
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,392
They've got
him
rolling in the aisles.

113
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,894
Well, I guess he's off
to a better place.

114
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,764
Any place would be
better than this dump.

115
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:26,365
Hey, hey!

116
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,133
Sorry, Alan. I didn't see you.

117
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,401
At least Dougie put laughter
in the air

118
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:31,926
and asses in the seats
and drinks on the tabs.

119
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,373
I loved that guy.

120
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,141
Took me 15 years to find
the next Kinison,

121
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:37,743
and the minute I do,
he gets a sitcom.

122
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,611
Now I have to pay
him a king's ransom

123
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,912
to come back here
once a year,

124
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,147
and this is where
he started.

125
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,316
(laughs)
Figures the bastard
would die on me.

126
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,218
You know, l-I should
put up a sign,

127
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:49,921
you know, like
in Dealey Plaza,
"Kennedy Shot Here,"

128
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,789
"Dougie Dropped Here."

129
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,157
Hey, Alan, you got
a spot open now.

130
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,426
What do you say tomorrow
you give me some time?

131
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:56,690
You got a job.
You want to keep it?

132
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,464
Dougie was a hack
with hack material

133
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:02,367
who caught a break
and never let anybody forget it.

134
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,935
Oh, you want suspects?

135
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,437
Here, check out
the wall.

136
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:09,669
Any one of these guys'd kill
to have his stage.

137
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:02,861
Oh, China.

138
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,763
Six bottles of Innoko water.

139
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,766
Three partially filled,
three unopened.

140
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,501
Don't go Cousteau
on me here.

141
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,203
It was all part
of his shtick.

142
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,405
He was like Tarkanian
with the towel.

143
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:15,841
You know, always
biting and pacing.

144
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:16,942
Dougie's mantra was,

145
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:20,309
"It's a cruel world.
Ain't it great?"

146
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,715
Uh, it was low-brow.
Strictly chug-and-belch.

147
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:26,885
Laughter is an involuntary
motor response

148
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:28,854
triggered by survival issues:

149
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:31,490
Food, sex, body functions...
death.

150
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,326
Yeah, it's a cruel world.

151
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,728
So, who has access
to the Green Room?

152
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,829
Well, according to who?

153
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,531
According to me,
just the talent.

154
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,734
According to these
meat sticks... the world.

155
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:43,435
All right.

156
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,471
I would like to see
everyone's wallet.

157
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:49,341
I don't need to see
your identification.

158
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,575
Just open
your wallets.

159
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:55,414
Uh, it says I'm
180 pounds, but I'm 145.

160
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,582
I know that,
in Nevada law,

161
00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:00,552
if there's a 25-pound
discrepancy, that...

162
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:02,884
that's actually
against the law.
Thank you.

163
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,093
Thanks.
You're welcome.

164
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,797
In this one
I'm wearing a thong.

165
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:16,401
That's more than
I needed to know.
Thank you.

166
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,925
(chuckling)

167
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,431
(garbled radio transmission
in distance)

168
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:32,781
When was the last time
you used this credit card?

169
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,109
What?

170
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:40,586
(garbled radio transmission)

171
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:01,580
O.O.D.?

172
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,482
Myocardial necrosis.

173
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,318
Just what you'd expect
from a heart attack,

174
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,119
only I didn't find
any blockages

175
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,988
consistent
with coronary disease.

176
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:12,324
He was remarkably healthy
for a dead guy.

177
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,327
Well, Dougie Max
had more than comedy
in his blood.

178
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,828
Tox came back
positive for coke.

179
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:22,494
The answer is... the three
main ways to take cocaine.

180
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,538
All right, Alex.
What is snorting it,

181
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,874
smoking it,
or injecting it?

182
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:29,407
Very good.

183
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:32,377
The answer is normal
nasal passages,

184
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:36,448
clear lungs, and no
track marks on the body.

185
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,083
Continuing this
childish metaphor,

186
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,652
what is how did the drugs
get into his system?

187
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,388
We'll have to wait
for
Final Jeopardy.

188
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,390
(sighs)

189
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,458
(exhaling)

190
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,127
My client has agreed
to plead to possession

191
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:50,595
and answer any questions.

192
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:51,363
Nothing she tells you

193
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,031
can be interpreted
as criminal intent...

194
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,432
Well, that's between
you and the DA.

195
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:57,536
The preliminary tox screen
on Dougie Max

196
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,905
came back positive
for cocaine.

197
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,140
Dougie was in
a program, okay?

198
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,410
It was my cocaine.
He wasn't using.

199
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,512
It was in his blood.

200
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,447
Well...

201
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:12,217
Dougie always liked to do
a little hum-and-coke

202
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,684
before a show.

203
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:26,565
Cocaine on the foreskin,
or any skin, for that matter,

204
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,467
is not a stimulant;
it's a numbing agent.

205
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:31,670
Right. That
was the idea.

206
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,674
You see, the goal wasn't
to pop the cork.

207
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,944
It was to...
shake the bottle.

208
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:39,611
Sounds frustrating.

209
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:42,747
Dougie liked to go out
on stage frustrated.

210
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,183
I ran away from home at age 25.

211
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:48,954
I drank... and I whored...
(cheering)

212
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,422
...and I got my own show!

213
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:51,156
(cheering)

214
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:54,526
Yeah,
Dougie to the Max,
bee-yatch!

215
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,428
Gave him an edge.

216
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,231
That was Dougie's philosophy:
Go in hot...

217
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:02,927
burn the place down.

218
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:07,606
Oh, you're making coffee.
Good. I could use some.

219
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,707
How do you take it?

220
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:11,109
Today, high-octane black.

221
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:14,679
I need your help with something.

222
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,113
Shoot.

223
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,784
A few weeks ago,

224
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,654
Homicide gets called
to Green Valley.

225
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:25,290
A woman in her 40s slips
in the bathtub and drowns.

226
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,125
You know, cracked skull,
raccooned eyes...

227
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,128
I mean, a traumatic death,
but nothing suspicious.

228
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:31,229
OSI found what?

229
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:34,299
I didn't call them in.
I ruled it an accident.

230
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,266
What changed?

231
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,969
Last night I saw
the husband

232
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,004
out on the town.

233
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:41,072
I mean, I could tell
you something, Nick.

234
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,141
Three weeks ago,
this guy was devastated.

235
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:46,244
(sobbing)
I should've been here.

236
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,213
What am I going to do?

237
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:51,583
I mean, she was my life.

238
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,485
Onward and upward.

239
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:54,552
No, but this is way upward.

240
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,688
I mean, trades in
his beat-up old Acura

241
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:57,622
for a brand-new Ferrari.

242
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,791
He's with a girl
who gives more lift-off

243
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,659
than-than Cape Canaveral.

244
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,762
(laughs)
People grieve
in different ways, man.

245
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:04,663
No, I understand that.

246
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,164
I got no problem with that.
I'm not a priest.

247
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:09,034
That's why I called
the life insurance carrier.

248
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:09,801
And check this out.

249
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,537
The morning...
Shelley Stark...

250
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:13,038
was found,

251
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:16,541
George Stark made a call
to the life insurance agent.

252
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,844
Went like this: "My wife
is dead. I want my money."

253
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:23,314
I mean, just like that.
All in one breath.

254
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,849
What's the payout?

255
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:25,316
$750,000.

256
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,153
Now, I got the police report,
autopsy protocol,

257
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:31,179
detective summary,
and scene photos.

258
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,326
You sure you're not
looking for Grissom?

259
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:40,198
I'm chasing something that Gil
Grissom isn't interested in...

260
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,700
a hunch.

261
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,101
I don't have to run any tests.

262
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:47,338
You cannot absorb enough cocaine
through your penis to OD.

263
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:48,540
Cite your source.

264
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,708
I don't have a source.

265
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,043
That's why we
did the tests.

266
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,044
Whatever.

267
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,569
All right, who wants it?

268
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,383
Cocaine levels

269
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:02,253
are less than.05 milligrams
per liter.

270
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:05,323
Way too low.
That's not what killed him.

271
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:05,857
So what did?

272
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,892
Well, according
to your blood sample,

273
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:08,727
naratriptamine.

274
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,195
The new migraine medication?

275
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:11,696
Mm-hmm. Powerful stuff.

276
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:12,897
And what were the
levels in the vic?

277
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:16,668
30 milligrams... 12 times
the recommended dosage.

278
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:20,605
Ooh. Dougie Max was poisoned.

279
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,072
To the max.

280
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:31,616
Cop shots.
No rulers, no markers.

281
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:35,609
Just a bathroom,
a towel bar,
and a dead woman.

282
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,625
Injuries are consistent
with an accident.

283
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,095
Yeah, but the contusion
to the back of the head

284
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,619
was not fatal.

285
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,676
Abbreviated autopsy.

286
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,411
Dr. Robbins oversaw.

287
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,413
Cause of death: Drowning.

288
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,115
It jibes
with the husband's account.

289
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,950
It jibes
with the detective's account.

290
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,152
There is nothing in this file

291
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,687
that suggests anything
other than an accident.

292
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:10,355
I don't know, Sara...

293
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:13,224
other people's notes,
other people's photos,

294
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,225
evidence twice-removed.

295
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:16,785
No OSI ever even got
to look at it.

296
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,724
Do you want to go
to the bathroom?

297
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:25,370
Consumables from the club

298
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,639
that matched
Dougie's stomach contents.

299
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,175
We know that he had
naratriptamine

300
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:30,809
in his system,

301
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,710
and we also know
that the poison was ingested.

302
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,647
Because Spam can't be absorbed
through the penis,

303
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:37,916
and if you ask me
to cite my source...

304
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,941
I'll take your word for it.

305
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,503
Death by chocolate again?

306
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,772
Hmm.

307
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:13,818
I'm Nick Stokes,
that's Sara Sidle
over there,

308
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:17,222
with the Vegas crime lab.
We're just here to...

309
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:17,856
Miss,

310
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,457
plea-please-please
don't get so close

311
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:20,391
to the car,
all right?

312
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,227
The alarm
is really delicate.

313
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:25,363
We're not really
as concerned
with the car, sir.

314
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,732
What we'd like to do
is look at your bathroom.

315
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:28,499
Um, why, wha-what

316
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,870
would you like
to look at the bathroom for?

317
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,204
Like I said,
we're with the Crime Lab.

318
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:36,241
We're here to tie up some loose
ends regarding your wife's case.

319
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,344
I appreciate how thorough
you guys are being,

320
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:42,714
but... I got...
I got to be honest.

321
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,349
This is pretty painful
territory for me.
Right.

322
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:47,418
I mean, it's still pretty hard
to get up in the morning

323
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,419
without Shelley.
I understand...

324
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:49,921
(knocks on car,
alarm sounding)

325
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:51,923
Ma'am, miss,
I thought I...

326
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,949
Sorry. L-l-l-I'm sorry.
I, uh...

327
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:58,730
Your neighbors are looking.

328
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,723
I'll get the keys.
Come on. Come on in.

329
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:08,239
It smells like fresh paint.

330
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,910
Yeah, I had
the whole place
redone this week.

331
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,411
Bad memories.

332
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,747
Did you replace the tub?

333
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:16,414
No.

334
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,279
But you replaced the fixtures.

335
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,452
There used to be
a towel bar there.

336
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:22,287
Yeah.

337
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:23,421
Would you by any chance

338
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,290
have the old towel bar
lying around somewhere?

339
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,393
No, the contractor tossed it.
It was junk.

340
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,427
Came with the house.

341
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:32,063
This whole
subdivision
comes stock.

342
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:32,964
In fact, the first thing

343
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,899
the broker told me
when I bought it...

344
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:35,767
if I ever want to sell,

345
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,602
invest in upgrades.
You selling?

346
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:40,298
Too big for one person.

347
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:42,874
Thank you.

348
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:46,577
Uh, thanks for your time.

349
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:47,874
Mmm.

350
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:51,783
You pulled the plug
kind of early.

351
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:52,583
What's going on?

352
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,919
Yeah, that bathroom's
not the crime scene anymore.

353
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,547
I say we go with
the next best thing.

354
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,825
Model home.

355
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:02,093
Model home.

356
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,462
What do Socrates,
Edgar Allan Poe,

357
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:06,597
and Dougie Max
have in common?

358
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,800
They all drank themselves
to death.

359
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,969
You've isolated the source
of the poison?

360
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,003
Naratriptamine...

361
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:15,073
Innoko water bottle
number three.

362
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:20,979
(cheering and applause)

363
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,810
Oh, God.

364
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,484
What about the other bottles?

365
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:26,985
Olean.

366
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:31,489
Okay. I need you to process that
bottle for trace impurities.

367
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,325
Got it. Anything that might've
mixed in with the poison

368
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,627
could help us identify
the original source.

369
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:38,363
We identify the source...

370
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,923
maybe we identify the killer.

371
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,468
Where are you going?

372
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,333
To get a drink.

373
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:53,144
75 units
with 75 identical floor plans.

374
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:57,148
I never thought I'd be grateful
for cookie cutter homes.

375
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,983
Like bees in a hive.
Gives me the creeps.

376
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,885
You sure you
don't want me
to do this?

377
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:01,953
Are you kidding?
I live for this.

378
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:04,889
And Shelley Stark and I
are the same height and weight.

379
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,692
Yeah, but you're
taller, thinner.

380
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:10,528
Oh, butter that toast, Nick.

381
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,430
(laughs)

382
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,159
(clears throat)

383
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,168
Okay, I'm Shelley Stark.

384
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:22,040
My bath is over,
and I'm about to get out, so...

385
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,043
I brace myself
with my left hand,

386
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,478
and I'm getting up
at a 45-degree angle,

387
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:31,382
and I slip... so, I grab
the first thing I can.

388
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,417
Towel bar.

389
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,577
Towel bar.

390
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:36,087
Okay.

391
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:36,687
So, at this point,

392
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:40,625
all of my weight
is being supported by this bar.

393
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,960
And it doesn't budge.

394
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,086
No.

395
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:48,232
(laughs)

396
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,100
You okay?

397
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,202
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine...

398
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:53,237
but this thing is coming down.

399
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:54,639
(clears throat)

400
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,436
Okay.

401
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:59,944
You sure you don't want me
to do that?

402
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:00,945
No.

403
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:02,146
(grunting)

404
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:03,408
Okay.

405
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:07,685
Sara.

406
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,243
(grunts)

407
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:12,190
There is no way

408
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,659
that Shelley Stark
brought down this towel bar.

409
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,526
You want me to give it a shot?

410
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,097
(rattling)

411
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:37,243
(pants)

412
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,453
Someone took a lot of effort to
make this look like an accident.

413
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:45,957
Yeah,
about $750,000 worth of effort.

414
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:46,557
Okay, so you know

415
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,059
the thing that drives me
crazy about men?

416
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,961
You know how
they take the toilet paper,

417
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,463
and then they put it up
on top of the holder.

418
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:53,531
What is that?

419
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:56,033
Do they not see that?

420
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,503
Are they just busy looking
at their underwear on the floor?

421
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,606
(laughs)
I got a nickname for my man.

422
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,107
I call him Mr. Drop-and-Stay,

423
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:06,511
'cause if he drops it, man,
it just stays there.

424
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,979
God, uh,

425
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,180
ooh, well,

426
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,681
and that's my time.

427
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:11,682
Uh, you've been

428
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:12,783
14 quiet people,

429
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:17,088
six empty tables,
and I'll see you in hell.

430
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:21,252
Modern version
of the old hook.

431
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:25,229
Welcome to Open Mike Night,
guys. What can I get you?

432
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,230
Information.

433
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,766
Wow, your coffee stinks.

434
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:31,536
Oh, really. I'm sorry
it's not up to the standards

435
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:32,503
of your crap-ass home brew,

436
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:35,106
but that'll be five bucks
all the same, my friend.

437
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:38,042
Dougie Max's Innoko water
bottles that were on the stage

438
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,177
his last performance...

439
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,344
who set them up?

440
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:42,013
Yours truly. Bartender.

441
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,015
Mr. Max had very
acquired tastes.

442
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,050
Lofty demands, you know.

443
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,186
Six pristine
Innoko water bottles,

444
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,188
labels all facing
the Luxor.

445
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,022
And a Green Room?

446
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:54,525
Forget it.
Silver tray, Spam, Choco Bees...

447
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:55,193
all blue.

448
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,194
Not-not to mention
that, uh,

449
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,696
passionfruit stuff...
what is it, two bucks a pop?

450
00:19:58,696 --> 00:19:59,630
Try to find that stuff.

451
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,066
Let's get back to the water.

452
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,829
It was poisoned.

453
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,571
Really?

454
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:06,837
Mmm.

455
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:09,173
The, uh, bottles
you took out to the stage...

456
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,175
where'd they come from?

457
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:13,077
That... Dougie's private stash.

458
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:16,781
Well, besides you and Dougie,
who had access to it?

459
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:20,318
Nobody's allowed behind the bar
besides the bar staff and me.

460
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,254
But no one listens to him.
You got a bottle opener?

461
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:25,556
Hey, that's going on your tab,
you leech.

462
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:26,224
I'm scared.

463
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,592
Well, you've got a temper...

464
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:29,393
and a record.

465
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:31,362
Assault. Club in Tucson.

466
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:32,230
Yeah, I had a temper,

467
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,898
until I kicked the crap
out of a heckler

468
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,766
for interrupting
my closing bit.

469
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,134
Do you get headaches?

470
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:38,202
I'm getting one right now.

471
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:40,670
We want all the Innoko water...

472
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:43,731
to go.

473
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,115
Warrick...

474
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:52,083
this just in.

475
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,385
D.B. At a convenience store
on Torrey Pines.

476
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:55,653
You're all I got.

477
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:58,222
I'm on it.

478
00:20:58,222 --> 00:20:58,756
Oh, hey, listen.

479
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,191
I checked the bartender's
medical records.

480
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,194
The guy's had six different
prescriptions for migraines

481
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,128
in the last two years.

482
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,396
Guess which one he's on now?

483
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:06,795
Naratriptamine.

484
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm Warrick Brown from OSI.

485
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,182
You want to tell me
what happened here?

486
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:25,950
I don't know.

487
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,286
Kid walks in.
He goes down an aisle.

488
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:31,278
Next thing I know,
he drops dead.

489
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,191
Where'd he start?

490
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:37,728
He was pacing back and forth,
scoping the place out.

491
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,297
I always spot
those kids.

492
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:39,964
People don't know.

493
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,433
You consume food or drink
in the store,

494
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,302
it's the same
as shoplifting

495
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,670
until you pay for it.

496
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,737
What'd he steal?

497
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:47,305
A beverage.

498
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,874
He put it back before
I could catch him.

499
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,676
Where?

500
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:53,371
Over here.

501
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:13,287
This isn't funny anymore.

502
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:18,035
Total recall.
We pulled 140 bottles

503
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,738
of Innoko water off the shelves
in this store alone.

504
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:22,606
There's 500 convenience stores
in Vegas.

505
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:25,109
We need to get this product
off the shelves now.

506
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:27,545
Grocery stores,
restaurants, wholesalers...

507
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:28,446
Right now,
it looks like

508
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,014
only your Innoko water product
is involved.

509
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,516
OSI is going to need the name
of any recent firings,

510
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,251
anyone with a lawsuit
against the company,

511
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,687
anyone who's made threats
against the company...

512
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,055
anyone with an axe to grind.

513
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,190
I know
that we risk panic,

514
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,658
Chief, but I'd rather

515
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:43,594
risk that
than have another victim.

516
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:44,562
Hang on.

517
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:47,064
We need to find out
what's in there.

518
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:49,066
I'm back.

519
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,167
Yeah.

520
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,001
Right.

521
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,537
I checked her
lungs... bath water.

522
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:55,740
And the blow to the
back of the head

523
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,941
consistent
with a fall.

524
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:57,975
Besides, Homicide
reported

525
00:22:57,975 --> 00:23:00,678
that nothing at the scene
indicated foul play,

526
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,713
so, there was no
reason to do more

527
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,515
than an abbreviated autopsy.

528
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,150
No one's impugning
your work, Doctor.

529
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,685
Yeah, it's nothing personal,
Doc.

530
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,520
Well, this
is
personal, Nick.

531
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,489
I tend to take
my work to heart,

532
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,624
and when the two of you
come in here

533
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:15,960
asking me to sign
a court-ordered request

534
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,997
for an exhumation of a body
that's already left my hands,

535
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,299
I tend to take it
very personally.

536
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,734
Look, I'm the one
who said

537
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:26,203
Shelley Stark's death
was an accident,

538
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:28,305
and I'm the one
with second thoughts.

539
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:29,807
I mean, it's my ass
on the line.

540
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,276
That's wrong, Captain.
It's my ass on the line.

541
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:34,478
I don't think the two of you
are sensitive

542
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:36,313
to what we're
really talking about here.

543
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,582
First of all, exhumations
are costly and public.

544
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:41,819
Makes this office look inept,
and that's just internally.

545
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,821
God forbid it gets
in the newspaper.

546
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:44,588
Remember something...

547
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:48,159
the public does not understand
abbreviated autopsy.

548
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,028
All they hear
is "Oh, what did he miss?"

549
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:52,997
No one's saying
you missed anything.

550
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:53,798
We have new evidence.

551
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:54,999
We need to reevaluate the body.

552
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,735
Respectfully, Nick,
I don't think you understand.

553
00:23:57,735 --> 00:24:00,137
I think I do understand.

554
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:01,605
Yeah, Nick...

555
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,274
Give us a minute,
will you?

556
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:04,832
Just a minute.

557
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,245
Neither of us want to be wrong,

558
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:10,714
but this isn't about
the press, the public,

559
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:11,749
your office,
you or me.

560
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,083
This is about Shelley Stark.

561
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,618
Now, we can do
one of two things.

562
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:16,554
We can do nothing,
let this guy walk,

563
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:19,523
or we can go to work,
exhume the body,

564
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,125
and find
new evidence.

565
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,355
Now, it's your call.

566
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:12,877
The poison
in both bottles

567
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,078
is naratriptamine.

568
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:16,647
Same trace impurities
in the water... sulfides,

569
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:19,183
phenols, amino acid complexes
and caffeine.

570
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:21,852
So, we've got two bottles
of poisoned Innoko water...

571
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,420
one from a comedy club
on Western,

572
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,322
the other
from a convenience store

573
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:26,423
halfway across town.

574
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:27,658
What's the connection?

575
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:29,693
There may not be one;
it could just be random.

576
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,295
So, how are we going
to get this guy?

577
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:32,329
You know, they never
caught the guy

578
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:35,266
who put the cyanide in the
Tylenol back in the '80s.

579
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,100
They found out

580
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,601
how the bottles
were tampered with.

581
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:39,865
That's where safety seals
came from.

582
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:06,330
No injection holes
in the bottle from
the Speedy Mart.

583
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,632
Do you see anything?

584
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:11,396
No... no, nothing yet.

585
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,407
Wait a minute.

586
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,967
It's in the threads.

587
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:27,484
Would you like to try
one from the Comedy Hole?

588
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:30,254
Mr. Phillips,
she's not going to hop out

589
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:31,655
of that coffin by herself.

590
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:34,391
Doc, I'm not quite sure
how to proceed.

591
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:35,993
First exhumation.

592
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:38,195
Well, it's very simple.

593
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:39,897
You open it up.

594
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,231
Now, if she grabs you,

595
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:45,002
use your free hand
and hold her down, okay?

596
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,171
Okay.

597
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,765
(lid squeaking)

598
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:54,478
Wow.

599
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,413
She's pretty well-preserved.

600
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:58,182
Well, embalming does...

601
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:01,018
Removes the blood,
retards bacterial growth,

602
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:03,287
and, uh, pickles the tissue.

603
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,021
David, would you
do me a favor?

604
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,023
Go to the store
and buy some
cold cream.

605
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:07,791
Why?
Her makeup...

606
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,226
it's got to come off.

607
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:10,828
Oh. Okay.

608
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:11,895
Thanks.

609
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:12,896
Yeah.

610
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:14,264
Thanks, Dave.

611
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:17,701
Las Vegas awakens today
with a terrible realization

612
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:20,537
that our city may face
a new and deadly menace.

613
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:24,208
15-year-old Casey Flynn
collapsed and died this morning

614
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:27,277
shortly after drinking a bottle
of Innoko water

615
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:29,546
at a convenience store
near Torrey Pines.

616
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:32,750
What kind of sick bastard
would do something like this?

617
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,052
The question isn't
who... it's how.

618
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:37,054
As in how do they
expect this lab

619
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:40,891
to test 40,000 bottles
of overpriced tap water?

620
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,260
If we have to, one
bottle at a time

621
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,462
until we find every
tainted bottle.

622
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,865
The events occurred
on opposite ends of town,

623
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,566
and investigators
have not yet established

624
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:53,303
a definite connection
between the two deaths.

625
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:56,073
But Las Vegas residents
fear the worst...

626
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,242
that our city may be in the grip

627
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:00,344
of a product-tampering
nightmare.

628
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,913
You know
how they tested for the cyanide

629
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:03,981
in the Tylenol case?

630
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,382
Hodges? One, two, three?

631
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:06,483
(imitates buzzer)

632
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:07,885
They took it to the airport.

633
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:11,522
They x-rayed bottles in bulk
using baggage scanners.

634
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,091
Nice... cyanide's opaque
to X rays.

635
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:16,093
Yeah, cyanide and X rays...

636
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,594
that's a lucky break.

637
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:18,595
But any of you geniuses

638
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:20,764
have a "lucky" test
for naratriptamine?

639
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:24,034
We've got a bigger problem
than we thought we had.

640
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:25,602
Why are you looking at me?

641
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:27,337
I'm not looking at you.

642
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:28,565
Yes, you are.

643
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:31,842
We think that we nailed
the tampering method.

644
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:33,877
The poison
wasn't inside the bottle.

645
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:35,312
It was on the bottle cap.

646
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:36,413
We think that the killer

647
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,515
dripped a solution
of naratriptamine

648
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:39,516
into the threads

649
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:40,350
of the bottle cap.

650
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,554
Capillary action pulled
the solution into the threads,

651
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,022
where it dried
into white crystals.

652
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,825
Oh, so, each time Dougie Max
and Casey Flynn took a sip,

653
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,960
the liquid came in contact
with the threads

654
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,985
and washed back
into the bottle.

655
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:54,631
And so the
poison I found

656
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,400
in the Innoko water
was... backwash.

657
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,635
Which means that
we're going to have

658
00:28:58,635 --> 00:28:59,837
to take the caps off

659
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:01,338
of 40,000 bottles.

660
00:29:01,338 --> 00:29:03,140
Right now,
that's the way it looks.

661
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,630
Great.

662
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:34,872
I need to see the lot numbers

663
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:37,374
of the bottles you pulled
from the convenience store.

664
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:41,345
I got all the stacks arranged
by locations,

665
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:45,082
so the convenience store
is right here.

666
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:50,019
140 bottles... NV6630.

667
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,690
The tainted bottles
didn't come from this lot.

668
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,127
Well, the bottle that
killed Casey Flynn
came from this store.

669
00:29:57,127 --> 00:30:00,497
Somebody may have just walked in
and put it there, though.

670
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:03,367
Where are the bottles
from the comedy club?

671
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,631
Over here.

672
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,375
These are a match.

673
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:15,579
So, the source of
the poison bottles
was the comedy club.

674
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:18,015
Maybe the killer
wanted us to think

675
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:20,651
it was random product tampering.

676
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,919
Why?

677
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,720
To cover up one murder
with another.

678
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:33,430
I've never seen
mold like this.

679
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,232
Embalming fluid's a witch's brew

680
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:38,569
of formaldehyde, phenol,
methanol and alcohol,

681
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:41,538
perfume and pink coloring agent.

682
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:45,008
Kills the bacteria,
but mold feeds on it?

683
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:45,509
Yeah.

684
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:48,712
It's like
bathing an infant, Nick.

685
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:51,943
Soft and always
in motion.

686
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:58,021
What's wrong?
I'm not doing it right?

687
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:59,423
No, you're
doing fine.

688
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:01,024
See the bruising

689
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:03,493
on her back and
her right elbow?

690
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,762
It's consistent with her fall.

691
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:07,497
But it wasn't in your report.

692
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:10,934
Well, it wasn't evident
four weeks ago.

693
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:12,669
Subtle bruising
may not be evident

694
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:13,470
at the time of death,

695
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,206
but it can be accentuated
by the embalming process

696
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,175
after the body leaves my slab.

697
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:23,113
This bruising would have meant
nothing to the mortician.

698
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:25,249
They're in the beauty business.

699
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:28,685
It's my job to spot them,
their job to cover them.

700
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:30,454
Let's turn her over.

701
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:31,488
Got her?

702
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:32,289
Yeah.

703
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:33,722
Here we go.

704
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:41,464
All right, let's see
what's under that makeup.

705
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:53,267
Bruises on her face.

706
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:57,581
Brass was right.

707
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:00,050
We are looking
at murder.

708
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,652
Naratriptamine
comes in tablet form.

709
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,287
In order to get it
in the solution,

710
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,087
you'd have to grind it up.

711
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:07,291
There were traces of caffeine
with the naratriptamine.

712
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,692
Right, so how
did it get there?

713
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,994
Maybe it got there
during the grinding process.

714
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:13,664
There was a coffee grinder
in the Green Room

715
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:16,030
at the Comedy Hole.

716
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,337
Do you provide your
comedians with coffee

717
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:21,838
or do they brew
their own?

718
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:22,773
Around here you get generic.

719
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:26,076
If they want something special,
they can bring a thermos.

720
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:29,313
Just take
whatever you want, okay?

721
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,838
Knock yourself out.

722
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:50,534
That's the last
picture taken

723
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:55,369
of Dougie Max
before he died.

724
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,612
Doesn't the red light
mean "get off the stage"?

725
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:05,282
No, the red light means
"get off the stage
now."

726
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:08,852
So why were you giving
Dougie Max the red light?

727
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,087
He's my headliner.

728
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:12,783
I wasn't giving him
the red light.

729
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,891
We're going to need
a sample of everyone's DNA.

730
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,426
All right, gentlemen.

731
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:50,127
Good afternoon.

732
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,828
Could you line up
for me, please.

733
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:52,796
Right up here,
please.

734
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:54,264
Is this going
to take a long time?

735
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:57,200
I've got a 4:00 bikini wax
that I don't want to miss.

736
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,303
I got to get my wig redone
like in a half hour, so if we...

737
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:01,772
I have plenty of time.

738
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,106
I have no career.

739
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,107
Right, well, I can see

740
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:07,811
you all know how to open
your mouths, so, good.

741
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,403
Ready?

742
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:13,617
Just give me an "O."

743
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:15,218
I need a lot of foreplay.

744
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:18,155
Oh, well, then maybe I
should use a rectal swab.

745
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,180
Ah... oh.

746
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:22,459
Good boy.

747
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:24,694
Okay, who's next
for some foreplay?

748
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:26,930
Oh, a nail
biter, huh?

749
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,831
You mind if I see your hands?

750
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,475
I'm one of 11 kids

751
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:39,476
from 12 dads.

752
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:40,644
You figure it out.

753
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:41,845
Yeah, I gave him the red light.

754
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:42,746
What are you going to do,

755
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:46,316
arrest me for distraction
with intent to humiliate?

756
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:47,977
I'm guilty.

757
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,987
What?
Are you kidding me?

758
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:53,490
I was joking.

759
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,858
Funny.

760
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:57,661
You know, something
about your wife's case

761
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:58,428
never felt right to me.

762
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:00,430
It bugged me,
kept me up at night.

763
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,433
It's not because you called
your insurance company

764
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:04,935
and filed a claim
the next day.

765
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,670
It's your policy;
it's your right.

766
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,972
It's not because you
bought a new Ferrari;

767
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:09,940
it's your money.

768
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,908
Or because you're
with a beautiful girl.

769
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:13,510
I mean, you just
lost your wife,

770
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,278
you need some companionship.

771
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:17,514
No.

772
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:20,784
Because of something you said.

773
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:23,420
What am I going to do?

774
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,922
She was my life.

775
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:30,927
You said, "She
was
my life."

776
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,229
Not
is.

777
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:32,996
That's why I'm sitting here?

778
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:36,800
Because I used the wrong tense
at the time of my wife's death?

779
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,934
No, hold on
a minute.

780
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:40,203
I've been a detective
for half my life.

781
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:43,707
I can count on one hand
the times surviving spouses

782
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:46,810
used the past tense,
and I got to tell you,

783
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:52,339
I'll be damned if every one of
them wasn't guilty of something.

784
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:55,852
Now, I mean, that's just me.

785
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:59,055
I mean, in a court of law
it means nothing.

786
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:00,957
NIOK:
But...

787
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:03,460
this...

788
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,896
and this...

789
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,964
and this...

790
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:09,266
mean everything.

791
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:11,001
The fact that
you're left-handed

792
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:12,736
doesn't hurt us either.

793
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:14,371
Hurts you, though.

794
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:16,072
Wait a minute.

795
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:17,841
I haven't
seen these.

796
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,042
New evidence.

797
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,578
Body was exhumed
by a court order.

798
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:23,947
Second autopsy.

799
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:25,248
You dug her up?

800
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:25,749
Mm-hmm.

801
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:29,085
I didn't give anyone
permission to dig her up.

802
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:30,854
You're a suspect
in a murder case.

803
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:32,489
We don't need your permission.

804
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:34,047
Can they do that?

805
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,326
Yeah.

806
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:39,796
You killed your wife, George.

807
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:41,998
I loved my wife.

808
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,867
And she loved you.

809
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,969
Which is why she didn't react

810
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:50,269
when you walked into
the bathroom that night.

811
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:23,807
You staged the crime scene.

812
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:26,042
You see, it's physically
impossible for her

813
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:29,045
to pull that towel rack
off the bathroom wall.

814
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:31,147
It was an accident.

815
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:33,883
You said so yourself.

816
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:36,374
I was wrong.

817
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:43,526
I see the pictures.
I hear the theories.

818
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:47,121
Still doesn't make
my client a murderer.

819
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,998
(indistinct muttering)

820
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,540
Hey!

821
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,342
Hey! Hey!

822
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:01,867
That's my car!
What are you...?

823
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:06,616
What the hell is going on here?

824
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:07,617
This is harassment.

825
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:10,453
We don't have enough
to file charges, but
the insurance company

826
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,589
feels they got
more than enough.

827
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:13,189
Civil charges.

828
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:16,693
Translated: That means they
want their cheese back, man.

829
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:17,861
They want their $750K.

830
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:20,030
They can just take my car?

831
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,064
For starters, yeah.

832
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:22,532
This isn't the end of our

833
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:24,701
criminal investigation
there, George.

834
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,569
It's just the beginning.

835
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:29,039
That's present tense.

836
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,540
The coffee you bagged
from the club

837
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,709
doesn't match
the tainted Innoko water.

838
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:34,377
That's the bad news.

839
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:35,378
Still listening.

840
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:38,481
You know what I have that
you want in the mornings?

841
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:42,385
Apart from my devilish grin and
rakish good looks, of course.

842
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:43,953
I like your coffee.

843
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:44,888
No, no.

844
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:45,722
You love my coffee.

845
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:46,990
And you want to know why?

846
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,724
It's Blue Hawaiian.

847
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,893
40 bucks a pound,
hand-picked...

848
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:52,195
I know,
the finest money can buy.

849
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:53,897
No, not even close.

850
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:54,564
Just let me get there.

851
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:56,666
Now caffeine by itself
is not distinctive.

852
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,501
It's in all kinds
of coffee by definition.

853
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:02,138
Now the trace amino acid
complex, on the other hand,

854
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:02,939
is a signature.

855
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:07,137
Okay, so you've identified
the type of coffee.

856
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:09,646
Kopi Luwak.

857
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:12,082
The most expensive
coffee in the world.

858
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:14,984
Revered for its rich,
chocolatey texture

859
00:39:14,984 --> 00:39:16,753
and made from the excrement

860
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:19,255
of a small Indonesian
cat-like creature

861
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:20,757
known as a luwak.

862
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:22,025
Oat feces?

863
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:23,993
The luwak eats
only the ripest beans,

864
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:27,130
which pass through
its digestive system intact.

865
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,465
However, during the process

866
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:30,767
enzymes break down
a number of amino acids

867
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:31,668
which cause
bitterness.

868
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:34,270
And leaves
a unique chemical signature.

869
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,272
So whichever one
of your suspects

870
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:39,173
drinks Kopi Luwak
is your killer.

871
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:44,280
We are a bashing nation.

872
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,282
Gay bashing?
You know what that is?

873
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:47,016
That's guys going,

874
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:51,087
"I hate you 'cause
you're queer and you're gay

875
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:53,289
"and you're kind
of attractive

876
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:56,760
"and I would like to have sex
with you but I'm in the closet

877
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,762
"so I'll just
beat you up

878
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:00,063
"and then play with myself

879
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:03,199
in my Trans Am
on the way home."

880
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,534
Boo.

881
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:05,301
Boo?

882
00:40:05,301 --> 00:40:06,503
Oh, I'm sorry.

883
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,104
I didn't mean to offend you.

884
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:09,272
Hey, you know what?

885
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:10,006
If that offends you,

886
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:12,208
perhaps you should
just come out of the closet

887
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,176
and move on with your life.

888
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:14,711
You're going to feel
so much better.

889
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,702
You know, you are what you hate.

890
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:20,214
(one person clapping lightly)

891
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,487
All right, um...

892
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:26,823
Mm, I'm a little dehydrated.

893
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:30,627
I hope you don't mind
if I replenish my bodily fluids.

894
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:31,821
Mm...

895
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,733
(laughing)

896
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:39,668
(applause)

897
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:42,705
It's a cruel world...

898
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:45,074
Ain't it great?

899
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:45,742
Yeah.

900
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:46,776
You know what you'd like?

901
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,845
How many people
would like it if I just,

902
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,547
if I just
dropped trou right now

903
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:53,616
and peed on
Vin Diesel's head, huh?

904
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:54,551
(cheering)

905
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:55,185
Wouldn't you like that?

906
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:58,354
I'll do it.
I'm willing to do it
for you good people.

907
00:40:58,354 --> 00:41:00,845
Oh, I'll do it.

908
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,529
(cheering)

909
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:07,530
Open wide.

910
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,699
I'm flattering myself,
ladies and gentlemen.

911
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,301
You don't have to open up
that wide.

912
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:15,071
See, I'm implying
I have a tiny, tiny penis.

913
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:17,173
That's what that joke would be.

914
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:18,374
Ergo, the comedy.

915
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:21,311
I'm talking about penises.

916
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:25,048
You just want to eat
out of that toilet bowl.

917
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:26,649
Yum, yum.

918
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:29,277
(cheering)

919
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:32,655
Shut up.

920
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,657
(cheering)

921
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:36,159
Shut up.

922
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,060
Don't you get it?

923
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,328
Are you that stupid?

924
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:39,796
I am making fun of you.

925
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,831
I am the lowest
common denominator

926
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:44,391
in comedy when I do that crap.

927
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:52,575
The only way I could get you
to stop laughing now

928
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:56,179
is if I went
to every single table

929
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:59,273
and slit every one
of your throats.

930
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:04,821
I can see that
I am getting

931
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:06,723
the red light,
ladies and gentlemen,

932
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:09,692
and that means
it's time for me to stop.

933
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:15,431
Stop with the hate
and stop with the fear.

934
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:18,601
Stop with the lies.

935
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:20,403
Comedy, uh,

936
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:24,207
comedy's supposed
to be about the truth.

937
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,944
You know, uh, I killed tonight.

938
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:33,616
And, uh, I killed, uh,
two nights ago.

939
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:35,652
Dougie Max.

940
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:38,416
Uh... on this stage.

941
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:45,728
'Cause I despised
everything he stood for.

942
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,898
Dumb people, like you.

943
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:52,869
You think I did a disservice
to the world

944
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:54,837
by killing
Dougie Max?

945
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:59,309
You ought to give me a parade.

946
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,244
But the shame of it is,

947
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:04,981
is that, uh, an innocent kid

948
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:07,984
got killed, too,
and, uh...

949
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:10,253
I blame you.

950
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:13,256
Yeah, I, uh...

951
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:17,660
I didn't think you were
going to get the joke.

952
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,163
Oh, I got it.

953
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:22,222
It just wasn't funny.
