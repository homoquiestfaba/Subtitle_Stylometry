1
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:03,246
What?

2
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:07,250
<i>Who might be
interrupting me prayers?</i>

3
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,888
<i>Oh, it's you patty.</i>

4
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:15,325
<i>Well, why would you
be talkin' to me?</i>

5
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,861
<i>You know, i'm just
a poor cobbler.</i>

6
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:19,962
<i>What can i do?</i>

7
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,335
<i>Ahh, i see.</i>

8
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,770
<i>But, why me?</i>

9
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:32,208
<i>Well, i'll do me best.</i>

10
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:38,816
<i>Aye. Well, i've always had
a lot of faith in you, too.</i>

11
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,842
Knock it off!

12
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,155
Excuse me, sir.

13
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,555
How much farther?

14
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:21,425
You're going to
erinville, right?

15
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:22,392
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:24,393
Oh, not
too much further,

17
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:28,431
i'd say erinville is right
at the end of that rainbow.

18
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:31,467
Got a pot of gold waiting
there for you, do you?

19
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:32,602
Pot of gold?

20
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:33,603
Well sure!

21
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,072
Leprechauns hide
their gold

22
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:36,439
at the end
of rainbows.

23
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,175
What's a leprechaun?

24
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,144
Why, i thought everybody
knew about leprechauns.

25
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:45,048
A leprechaun is an elf from ireland
with special powers of his own.

26
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:48,618
If you capture one he's got
to take you to his pot of gold,

27
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,888
and grant
you three wishes.

28
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,890
But be careful, if you let him
out of your sight for one moment

29
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:56,960
he's gone
and owes you nothing.

30
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,837
Do you think there's
leprechauns in erinville?

31
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:13,376
I recall a rumor that there's
a leprechaun around erinville.

32
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:16,846
But mind you,
it was just a rumor.

33
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:22,386
Where did it go?

34
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,586
The rainbow?

35
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:26,690
Don't be worryin'
yourself none, laddie.

36
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,825
I know where
we're goin'.

37
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,869
You don't think you're being
a little too obvious, do you?

38
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,204
No. As a matter
of fact, i don't.

39
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,040
It's part
of the plan.

40
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,376
Seems to me the last thing
sam needs is a dreamer.

41
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:22,713
Why don't you just
help me with the ladder?

42
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:32,055
Why don't you just ask her to
marry you and get it over with?

43
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:34,124
Cause she'll say no!

44
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,562
You two boys need to have
some faith. Learn to believe.

45
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:44,868
She needs someone who has at
least one foot on the ground.

46
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,603
What she needs
is me,

47
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:50,874
and fortunately
i'm available.

48
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,585
Right on time.
See ya, boys.

49
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,656
Good morning,
good morning!

50
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:07,623
'Morning.

51
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,624
The usual?
Yes, indeed.

52
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,798
So Alex, what
kind of scientist

53
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,499
are we studying
to be today?

54
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,968
An epidemiologist.

55
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,036
A what?

56
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,804
An
epidemiologist.

57
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:24,841
Somebody who studies epidemics-
you know, like the black plague?

58
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:27,276
Sounds pretty
serious to me.

59
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:29,377
It is.

60
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:34,618
Your niece and
nephew coming today?

61
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:36,018
Yeah.

62
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,088
How long since
the plane crash?

63
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,356
Almost 6 months.

64
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:45,228
Well, if anybody can help
them face reality, you can.

65
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,497
I hope so.

66
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,367
Ta, ta!

67
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,368
See ya.

68
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,508
Come in.

69
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,312
Getting settled okay?

70
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:40,149
I'm glad you decided to
come up here for the summer.

71
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,619
Mom said being here was
like being in heaven.

72
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,892
So i figured maybe that will
make it easier for him to find me.

73
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,497
Hey, you're going
to have a great time.

74
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:01,571
And i'm sure you'll have
all sorts of adventures.

75
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:02,706
Adventures?

76
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,806
Well sure.

77
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,275
Hey, just look out there.

78
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,279
Who knows what adventures
are waiting for you out there.

79
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,650
Why don't you come
downstairs for a bite to eat?

80
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,751
Okay.

81
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:29,666
Are you coming?

82
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,934
Be right there.

83
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,428
Becky?

84
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,395
Becky!

85
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,998
We were just about
to have some lunch.

86
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:03,166
What?

87
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,268
I said we were just
about to have lunch.

88
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:06,236
No thanks.

89
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:07,503
Are you sure?

90
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,738
I made some
chicken...

91
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,173
i'm not hungry.

92
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,174
Okay...

93
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:35,632
star gazing?

94
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,633
Yeah.

95
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,578
Did you ever
see so many stars?

96
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,081
There's the
big dipper.

97
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,248
See it?

98
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:53,650
Yeah.

99
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:56,486
And there's
the north star,

100
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:59,855
it's helped many a lost
soul find their way home.

101
00:09:59,956 --> 00:10:01,324
Really?

102
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,626
Alex has
a telescope.

103
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,830
Maybe tomorrow she can
show you how to use it.

104
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,998
Okay.

105
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,099
Okay.

106
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,436
Time for bed.

107
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,977
Goodnight,
aunt sam.

108
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:23,213
Goodnight,
honey.

109
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:25,915
Goodnight,
ace.

110
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:36,526
I sure hope dad knows
about the north star.

111
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,667
Vrooommm...

112
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:52,708
ready for landing?

113
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,476
Ready!

114
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:56,312
Okay, here we go!

115
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:03,819
Again! Again!

116
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,889
Sorry, Tommy. It's
time for me to go.

117
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,026
Tell me what it's
like up there, again.

118
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,761
It's beautiful.

119
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:15,130
You feel like you're floating
over and through the clouds

120
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,667
and the earth's
real small below.

121
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:18,969
It's heaven!

122
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,070
I wish i could
go up with you.

123
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,273
We'll see to it that
you get your wish.

124
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:27,343
When i get back,
i'll fly you up there.

125
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:28,644
Promise?

126
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,747
With ace as my
witness, i promise.

127
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:02,278
Guys, breakfast!

128
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:11,086
Hey, you're late.
The shop's open.

129
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:14,090
Not to worry my dear
friend, not to worry.

130
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,692
All right,
i'll bite.

131
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:18,794
Why aren't you
across the street?

132
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,530
It's part
of the plan.

133
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,599
Today, i go in
a little late.

134
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,567
Each day
a little later.

135
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:28,304
Til she misses me
and i won't go in at all.

136
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:30,405
Yeah, so?

137
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:36,445
That's the night
i ask her to marry me.

138
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,082
I'm telling you,
it'll work.

139
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,484
Ted, you
missed a spot.

140
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,329
Good morning.

141
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,297
The usual?

142
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,798
Thank you
very much.

143
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,001
Hello.

144
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,770
Don't i get a "good
morning" out of you?

145
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,005
Good morning!

146
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,272
Who's your
new friend?

147
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,573
My cousin,
Tommy.

148
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,574
Hi, Tommy.
Welcome to erinville.

149
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,810
I'm rick callahan.

150
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,212
Are you
a policeman?

151
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:10,780
No, close though.

152
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:11,881
I'm a fireman.

153
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,984
Ever see a real
fire truck up close?

154
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,054
Mine's across the street.
Want to take a look at it?

155
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,222
Yeah!

156
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:22,492
Come on,
i'll race you!

157
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:26,429
Wait!

158
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,834
We keep some of our
emergency equipment in here.

159
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,437
This ladder will get us up as
high as 3 floors if we need to.

160
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:36,572
More emergency
equipment here.

161
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:38,207
What's
that thing?

162
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,475
What, this?

163
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,778
This is the main
water hook up.

164
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,313
You hook this up to the
fire hydrant on the street

165
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:46,382
with the hoses here.

166
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:48,718
Jump up here and
i'll show you the cab.

167
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,523
That's spot.

168
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:55,457
We rescued her from
the top of a tree.

169
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,926
Found she
had no owner,

170
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,094
so we kept her.

171
00:13:58,095 --> 00:13:59,962
Haven't seen
a mouse since.

172
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,931
Never saw
one before.

173
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:04,700
That may
be true, but...

174
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:09,705
i see mr. Conners
has caught your eye.

175
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,073
Full of blarney he is,

176
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,643
but he's loved
by the whole town.

177
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:16,712
He's a leprechaun
if there ever was one.

178
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:17,914
A leprechaun?

179
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:19,915
There's no such
thing as a leprechaun.

180
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,317
No such thing?

181
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,652
That's right.

182
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,221
Fairies and all that
stuff are just made up.

183
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,556
They don't really exist.

184
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,258
How can you
be so sure?

185
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,894
Because you can't
scientifically prove it.

186
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:33,796
That may be true,

187
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,797
but there was
once a time

188
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,568
when scientists couldn't prove
bacteria and viruses existed.

189
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,736
They were laughed at

190
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:43,205
'til the microscope
was invented, right?

191
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:45,374
Yeah, you're right.

192
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:47,743
That discovery
led to vaccines and cures.

193
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:50,079
That's exactly right.

194
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,715
So don't be so quick
to disbelieve

195
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:54,884
because you can't see
or prove something existed.

196
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:57,086
You might miss
some pretty neat stuff.

197
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,588
Remember<i> belief</i>
precedes the miracle.

198
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:01,457
Rick, i believe
in eating!

199
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,459
Where's our food?

200
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,928
Uh-oh, gotta
go guys, i forgot!

201
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,330
See you guys later.

202
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:11,567
I still say there's no
such thing as leprechauns.

203
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,903
And i say there are

204
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:16,004
and he is one.

205
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,772
Is not.

206
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:17,707
Is too.

207
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,808
Is not.

208
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:19,775
Is too.

209
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:20,676
Is not.

210
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:23,679
Mr. Conners is just
a nice old man

211
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,915
who tells stories
down at the diner.

212
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:29,352
He is one, and
i can prove it.

213
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,087
How?

214
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:32,922
We'll capture him!

215
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,923
Yeah, right.

216
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:41,497
Then, we'll get our wish.

217
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,343
I still say
he's a leprechaun.

218
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:55,477
Is not.

219
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:56,378
Is too.

220
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:57,480
Is not!

221
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:59,115
Is too.

222
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:01,116
Look it up.

223
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:15,898
An irish elf
who works as a shoemaker.

224
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,500
See!

225
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:20,002
A shoemaker?

226
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,104
He keeps a pot of gold.

227
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:25,775
Upon capture, the leprechaun
must disclose his location of gold

228
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:29,178
and grant his
captors three wishes.

229
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,815
Told ya!

230
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,916
Whoa!

231
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:01,610
Stay down! Keep low!

232
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,712
Hurry! Hurry!

233
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,182
I see him.

234
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:07,416
He's coming.

235
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,951
Don't forget,
if he gets away,

236
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:11,387
he doesn't have to
give us three wishes.

237
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,721
I know, i know.

238
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:15,624
That's if he's
a leprechaun.

239
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:22,265
Don't!
He'll see you.

240
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,266
But how are we
supposed to see him?

241
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:25,601
We should be
hiding over there.

242
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:27,036
That way we
can watch him.

243
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:29,371
Okay, but let's make it
quick so he doesn't see us.

244
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,473
The next time
he stops, we'll run.

245
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:41,918
What happened?

246
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,453
I think he saw me!

247
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:44,553
Are you sure?

248
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,656
No, but he's
still coming.

249
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:48,791
Then he probably
didn't see you.

250
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:50,892
Let's go!

251
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,430
Hoo hooo!

252
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,558
Halt!

253
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,992
You're captured!

254
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,295
What's this?

255
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,564
Miniature bandits?

256
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:29,999
We're not bandits.

257
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,767
But we know
who you are!

258
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:32,935
And who might that be?

259
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:35,104
You're a leprechaun,
and since we caught you,

260
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:37,807
you have to take us
to your pot of gold

261
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,608
...and grant
us three wishes.

262
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:40,909
A leprechaun is it?

263
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,178
My, my Alex!

264
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,747
I never realized
you were a storyteller, too!

265
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,849
Tommy thinks
you're a leprechaun.

266
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,084
Tommy is it?

267
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,186
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

268
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:53,222
Liam patrick conners,
at your service.

269
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:56,892
What gives you this notion
i'm a leprechaun?

270
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:00,062
And don't think you
can get away from me.

271
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:03,899
I'm sure i couldn't, even
if i were a leprechaun.

272
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,634
I told you
he isn't one!

273
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,170
I didn't say that!

274
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:08,637
Then
you are one?

275
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:10,206
And i didn't
say that.

276
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,940
So are you a
leprechaun or not?

277
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:14,610
What if i told you
i was an angel?

278
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:15,811
Angels have wings.

279
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,680
Oh they do,
do they?

280
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,915
And what might
a leprechaun look like?

281
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:21,350
Like you.

282
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:24,386
You two have got me
in quite a spot here.

283
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:28,323
If i tell you i'm not a
leprechaun you'll think i'm lying

284
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,059
so i can be on my way.

285
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,963
Tommy, you can't
judge a book by its cover.

286
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:35,764
Especially an old one.

287
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:38,367
Huh?

288
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,871
It's not what a person looks like
that makes them what they are.

289
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,739
It's the intent
of their hearts

290
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,509
and the good they are willing
to do for others that matters.

291
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,146
He's trying to tell you
he's not a leprechaun, Tommy.

292
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,715
So you can't grant
me three wishes?

293
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,916
No, i can't.

294
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:57,386
If only we could find
the lost faeden...

295
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,188
the what?
The what?

296
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:02,191
Surely you've heard the
legend of the lost faeden?

297
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,625
What's a faeden?

298
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:07,029
The faeden is
a small gold flute,

299
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:11,133
the king of the fairies uses to
play the song of the creator on.

300
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,836
It helps all the other
fairies see the glory

301
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:15,937
and the wonder
and the beauty of life.

302
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:19,275
And Tommy, it's also what
he uses to grant wishes.

303
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:20,876
And it's lost?

304
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:23,279
Aye.
That's quite a story.

305
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,447
You see, one day
the king of the fairies

306
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,317
comes to me
with a special order...

307
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:30,953
to make shoes
for all the fairies.

308
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,522
They've got this
wonderful ball coming up.

309
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:38,728
They're going to
have funny fireflies hanging...

310
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,697
but that's another story.

311
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,698
But anyway,
after he left

312
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:46,669
i realized he'd left
his faeden behind.

313
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,673
I put it in me safe for
safekeeping awaiting his return.

314
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:52,808
But that night,
as i was working late,

315
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:56,912
a young man busts into me
shop and demands all me money.

316
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,881
And i give it to
him, every cent.

317
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,318
But that wasn't enough for him,
he wanted the faeden as well.

318
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,686
I told him,
"it's no use to you"

319
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,788
"since you don't know
how to use it."

320
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:08,256
But he took it anyway.

321
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:10,159
I chased him
as far as i could,

322
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
but i lost him.

323
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:13,128
He got away from me.

324
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:15,730
But he didn't get
away from the others.

325
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:17,232
What others?
What others?

326
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,768
Why, the fairies,
of course.

327
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,538
He tried to make his get away
through these fields and woods.

328
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:26,142
But he never made it.

329
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,343
What happened?

330
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,912
Well, the police found
his body in the river.

331
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:31,113
Poor soul.

332
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:33,549
They never knew for sure
what happened to him,

333
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,684
but i do.

334
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,685
What?

335
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,055
C'mere.

336
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,724
The pooka.

337
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:43,392
The pooka?
The pooka?

338
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:47,762
Shhh...! Aye,
an odd fairy that one.

339
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,166
Comes at night
in the shape of a horse,

340
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,267
and beckons you
to ride him.

341
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:54,103
But if you
mount his back,

342
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,804
he'll take you
on a death ride

343
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,706
that you'll
never survive...

344
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,575
unless you're one
of the bravest at heart.

345
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:01,810
Wait a minute.

346
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:03,545
If they got
the thief,

347
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,546
then the king
got his faeden back!

348
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:08,817
No lass, seems that he lost
it somewhere on the fairy ride.

349
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:11,686
Then the fairies know
where it is, right?

350
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:13,789
No, according
to the legend,

351
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,325
this area is still filled with
fairies all looking for the flute.

352
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:18,060
Really?

353
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:20,896
Aye lad, and they'll
find it someday.

354
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:23,566
But i kinda feel
responsible for it

355
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,667
and i'd like
to find it first

356
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,537
so i could give
it back to the king meself.

357
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,440
So i come here everyday
looking for it.

358
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,710
It's here somewhere,
in these fields and woods.

359
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,246
But alas,
the going's slow because

360
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:40,048
me eyes aren't
what they used to be.

361
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,518
We could help
you look for it.

362
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,020
It'll be like
a treasure hunt.

363
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:47,121
Aye, you could
at that,

364
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,458
and a fine treasure
we might find.

365
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,193
But i don't know...

366
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:53,962
look, look, look there!

367
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,298
What do you see?

368
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:56,865
I don't see
anything.

369
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:58,000
Nothing?

370
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,869
Trees.

371
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,706
Only trees?

372
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:07,876
And look,
what's that over there?

373
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:09,578
Clouds!

374
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:11,579
Clouds.

375
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,316
And
that's all?

376
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:16,952
What about
the wind? Listen.

377
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:19,388
Did you hear 'em?

378
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,626
Ahh, never mind.

379
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:27,096
I can see i've
got me work cut out.

380
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,298
You've got
a lot to learn.

381
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,900
This is not a task for
the faint of heart, you know.

382
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:34,270
I'm brave.

383
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,204
Are you now?

384
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:40,642
The fairies don't want anybody
else to find the faeden.

385
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:43,346
You'll have to be smart
to avoid their traps.

386
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:44,713
I'm very smart.

387
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,183
Aye, i knew
that about you.

388
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:50,753
You'll have to learn to
believe in many wondrous things.

389
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:52,955
These fields and woods
are full of things

390
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,024
you've never
seen or heard before.

391
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,024
We'll learn.
We'll learn.

392
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:58,025
You will?

393
00:23:58,094 --> 00:24:01,563
You'll learn.
Well, that's different!

394
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:03,665
Why not, then?

395
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:06,402
We'll meet
back here tomorrow,

396
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:09,004
and that's when
our journey will begin!

397
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:12,007
That is, if it's all right
with your mother, Alex.

398
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:13,909
Let's see what
time it is here?

399
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,380
Here, hold that.

400
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,618
Ahh, it's
getting late!

401
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,085
She's going
to be worried.

402
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:25,087
Off with you, now.

403
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,088
Go on, go on!

404
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,089
I'll see you tomorrow.

405
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,328
Leprechauns, is it?

406
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:35,329
Well, why not?

407
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:37,900
What?

408
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:40,869
What do you mean you don't
like the way i'm doing it?

409
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,606
I am a storyteller,
not a preacher.

410
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:47,810
No, you can't put angels
with leprechauns and fairies,

411
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:49,945
it would
ruin the story!

412
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:52,681
Besides, you could play
one of the fairies.

413
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,217
Well, you've got
the wings for it.

414
00:24:55,318 --> 00:24:59,188
Ah, patty,
where's your sense of humor?

415
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:03,658
So, how was
everyone's day?

416
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:04,926
Great!

417
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:06,395
We caught
a leprechaun.

418
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:09,798
We snuck up behind a stump,
jumped out and caught him.

419
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,334
That's great, honey.

420
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:14,336
Becky, how was your day?

421
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:15,437
Fine.

422
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:20,008
Tomorrow take a book
and go down to the lake.

423
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:22,144
I didn't bring any books.

424
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:24,846
We can fix that.

425
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,451
Mr. Conners said we could help
him look for the lost faeden.

426
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:32,520
Then maybe the fairy king
could grant us three wishes.

427
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,056
Could i be excused?

428
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:35,724
The lost what?

429
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:37,492
The lost faeden.

430
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,729
A gold flute that
was stolen from him.

431
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,299
Could i be excused, please!?

432
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,067
What is wrong?

433
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:47,068
I've had enough!

434
00:25:50,073 --> 00:25:52,073
You're excused.

435
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:57,612
Can we please help him
find it, mom?

436
00:25:57,714 --> 00:25:58,881
Find what?

437
00:25:58,882 --> 00:26:00,348
The faeden.

438
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:04,085
Look, i don't want you
two bothering mr. Conners.

439
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:07,156
I know he
likes to tell stories,

440
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,591
and they're nice to
listen to but you can't...

441
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,527
but,
he needs our help.

442
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,598
And besides it'll be
like an adventure. Yeah!

443
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,500
I'll talk to him.

444
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:20,601
Yes!

445
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,973
When did that happen?

446
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,709
I'm on the phone.

447
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,443
<i>I needto
talkto you.</i>

448
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:30,712
It's my aunt.
I got to go. Bye.

449
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:32,814
Come in.

450
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,052
I'm sorry.

451
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,854
Just sometimes i get
so tired of hearing

452
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:41,957
about what Tommy
and the stuffed bird did.

453
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,092
I see.

454
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,694
I seem to recall
a little girl

455
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:48,329
who wouldn't go anywhere
without sebastian.

456
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:49,998
That was different.

457
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,567
You're right.

458
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,703
Sebastian wasn't the last
gift your dad ever gave you.

459
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:57,606
Do you know why he carries
around that dumb bird?

460
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:00,108
He thinks dad's
coming back.

461
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:02,044
If he doesn't have
it, dad won't find him.

462
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:04,646
Look, he's only seven.

463
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:07,049
You sound just
like my mom.

464
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,850
Why don't you just
make him understand

465
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:11,620
that dad's never
coming back.

466
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:16,591
I know losing your
dad still hurts,

467
00:27:16,692 --> 00:27:21,730
but i promise, in time
the hurt will heal.

468
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:27,436
You may feel like there's
nothing left to believe in.

469
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:32,474
Like there's a big empty
place in your heart.

470
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:34,575
What am i supposed
to put in there?

471
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,615
I wish
i knew, becky.

472
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,686
I wish i knew.

473
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:03,772
Good morning to ya.

474
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,907
And what
have we here?

475
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,276
A metal detector!

476
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:08,476
A machine that...

477
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:11,613
my, what a good idea!

478
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:13,415
And that's not all.

479
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:15,884
A map, so we know
where we've searched.

480
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,620
Aren't you
the smart one?

481
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:20,922
I'm glad you're
on this hunt with us.

482
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:23,726
Look! Here's where we are
at the edge of the woods.

483
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,328
We've got all this
area here to cover.

484
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:27,429
Whoa...

485
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,863
that's a
lot of area.

486
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:32,233
Well, if you've got
something better to do?

487
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,268
No.

488
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:37,906
Tommy, today
you're the leader.

489
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,341
Where we gonna go?

490
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,946
That way.

491
00:28:44,947 --> 00:28:47,049
All right, then...

492
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,150
onward!

493
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:56,391
½ it's heard on the wind
and the wings of summer. ½

494
00:28:56,492 --> 00:29:03,492
½ softly it sings
ta-loo ta-lee. ½

495
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:08,736
½ echoing sweetly
as we once wondered ½

496
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:15,838
½ where can we find
the answers we seek? ½

497
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:22,651
½ so sweetly
its melody shows the secret ½

498
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:29,752
½ to all with
a broken heart to heal. ½

499
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:35,130
½ it's found in the dreams
of the child that seeks it ½

500
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:42,231
½ the end of the rainbow
is always so near. ½

501
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:48,576
½ look to the sky when your
heart feels like flying. ½

502
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:55,150
½ race with the clouds
til the sun sets. ½

503
00:29:55,251 --> 00:30:00,355
½ look deep inside
when it's joy that ye seek. ½

504
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:07,196
½ it is easy
when you but believe. ½

505
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:12,901
½ when looking
through eyes of imagination ½

506
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:20,002
½ all that surrounds
you blossoms anew. ½

507
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:24,846
½ from fields of clover
to sweet carnation ½

508
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:31,947
½ the colors of life
now burst into view. ½

509
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:38,226
½ so tarry awhile
in this land enchanted ½

510
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:44,198
½ found in that
place deep within. ½

511
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,336
½ there you'll find peace. ½

512
00:30:47,437 --> 00:30:50,238
½ there you'll find joy. ½

513
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:57,212
½ it is waiting
if you but believe. ½

514
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:04,052
½ open your eyes
and believe. ½

515
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,089
we've covered
a lot of ground.

516
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,290
I think it's
time for a rest.

517
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:12,727
How about under
this fine house?

518
00:31:12,828 --> 00:31:14,362
It's
not a house.

519
00:31:14,363 --> 00:31:15,831
It's our tree.

520
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,699
Your tree,
is it?

521
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,735
Looks like a fine
solid house to me.

522
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:21,836
Tommy?

523
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:23,305
Looks like
a tree to me.

524
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:28,277
Let's take a seat
under your tree.

525
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:33,515
Come on, help the
old man down here.

526
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:35,684
Easy does it.

527
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:38,019
Oh, my goodness.

528
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:42,591
Well,

529
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,660
i can see you two are
going to need a little help.

530
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:50,465
What are these?

531
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:53,568
Training wheels for
your imagination.

532
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:57,939
Someday you won't need them,
but for now put them on.

533
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,410
All right now, both of
you, close your eyes.

534
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:08,583
Alex, you're no
longer a little girl,

535
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:12,054
but a sweet,
gentle squirrel.

536
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:18,593
And Tommy, you're a little
bird, a beautiful blue bird.

537
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,461
Now think.

538
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:23,899
Both of you think.

539
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,470
Now, squirrel, open your
eyes, and what do you see?

540
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,207
I see grass...

541
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:35,310
really tall grass.

542
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,212
And bluebird,

543
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:39,213
open your eyes.

544
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:42,050
Tell me what you see.

545
00:32:42,151 --> 00:32:44,418
I see brown, just brown.

546
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,222
It can't be just
brown, must be something,

547
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:51,259
sometimes you have to
stand back to see the truth.

548
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,430
The tree!

549
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:58,466
Aye, the tree!

550
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:01,803
Squirrel,
do you see the tree?

551
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:03,104
Uh huh.

552
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:07,275
Okay, both of you up the tree.

553
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:14,983
What do you see?

554
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:16,984
Explore the tree.

555
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:22,357
Squirrel,
you've come to a hole.

556
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,292
Take a look inside.

557
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,794
Tell me
what you see.

558
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,329
It's my house!

559
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,830
Ahh,
your house is it?

560
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:31,833
Bluebird,
can you find your house?

561
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:36,405
Found it!

562
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:39,775
All right,
you can come down now.

563
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:52,020
Now tell me, what
are you sitting under?

564
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:55,524
A house.
A house.

565
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:59,761
You can take your
glasses off now.

566
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,034
Alex, i'm sure if you
imagined hard enough

567
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:09,103
you could see things from
a squirrel's point of view,

568
00:34:09,204 --> 00:34:11,439
but you didn't
actually become one.

569
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,007
Do you understand?

570
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:14,442
I guess so.

571
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,644
But how could
it seem so real?

572
00:34:16,745 --> 00:34:18,480
I don't know.

573
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:23,151
But there's always a logical,
rational, explanation,

574
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:26,054
even if i can't
think of it right now.

575
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:28,155
Okay?

576
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,329
Bye, honey.

577
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,230
Bye, mom.

578
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:36,464
Bye, rick.

579
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:37,866
Bye, Alex.

580
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,901
Do you always tell her

581
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:42,303
there's a rational
explanation for everything?

582
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:43,872
Oh, sure.

583
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,940
It's disquieting
to kids to give them

584
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,077
all sorts of fantastical explanations
and silly reasons for things.

585
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:50,378
It makes
them unsure.

586
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,348
But what about the
things you can't explain?

587
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:55,183
We won't be
too late.

588
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:57,719
Take your time. I
get paid by the hour.

589
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Yeah. Well?

590
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,524
Look, nothing's
come up, yet.

591
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:06,227
Yeah, but it might. Then
what are you gonna do?

592
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,511
½ ll-de-di, ll-de-di,
ll-de-di... ½

593
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:25,146
what are
you humming?

594
00:35:25,147 --> 00:35:28,916
Oh... that's a tune the fairy
king plays on the faeden.

595
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:30,418
C'mere, c'mere.

596
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:34,355
Listen,
can you hear them?

597
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:35,524
Who?

598
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:37,859
The fairies,
of course.

599
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,795
I don't
hear anything.

600
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:40,728
Nothing?

601
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:41,963
Just the birds.

602
00:35:41,964 --> 00:35:44,765
Aye, the birds and the
wind through the trees

603
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:47,469
and the animals
rushing through the field.

604
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,872
During the day, the fairies play
along with the sounds of the meadow

605
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:53,107
and at night to the
crickets and the owls.

606
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,577
If you listen very
carefully, you can hear them.

607
00:35:55,678 --> 00:35:57,445
Well, come along now.

608
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,546
But be careful!

609
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,315
Don't let their
music distract you.

610
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:01,983
If you're
not very careful,

611
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:03,984
they could lure
you into a fairy ring.

612
00:36:03,986 --> 00:36:05,119
A fairy ring?

613
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,955
Aye,
step in one of those

614
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,823
and the fairies
will have you dancing

615
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,824
to their tune
for seven years.

616
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,619
Hee, hee, hee!

617
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:45,092
½ ll-de-dl-de-
dl-de-di... ½

618
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:49,697
whoo! I think i'm
caught in a fairy ring.

619
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:53,935
Tommy, can you
help me, please?

620
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:03,812
Alex, do you think you
can pull us out of here?

621
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,883
You're kidding!

622
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:12,320
Oh, i wish i was there.

623
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:16,624
You're not going
to believe what i'm looking at.

624
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:20,095
My deranged brother and my misfit
cousin are dancing around with,

625
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,931
get this, a leprechaun
they caught yesterday.

626
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,032
Don't ask.

627
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:29,103
I wish i was
anywhere but here.

628
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,407
What about the
faeden? The what?

629
00:37:32,507 --> 00:37:33,774
The faeden.

630
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:36,645
We were looking
for the faeden.

631
00:37:36,745 --> 00:37:38,279
Oh,
that's right!

632
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,216
Look, we're safe now,
and it's all because of you.

633
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:45,019
What did i do?

634
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,356
You reminded us
of our goal

635
00:37:48,457 --> 00:37:51,359
and it broke
the fairies' spell.

636
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,993
Let's sit down.

637
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:54,095
How come?

638
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:57,431
You see, fairy rings
only work on people

639
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:00,168
who've forgotten what's
important in their lives.

640
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:01,569
Once they
do that,

641
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,805
the fairies have them
chasing here and there

642
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,640
after
frivolous things,

643
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:08,210
running around in
circles and going nowhere.

644
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,411
Why would
they do that?

645
00:38:10,512 --> 00:38:12,480
Because fairies
love to laugh.

646
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:16,151
You must admit,
we looked pretty silly.

647
00:38:19,221 --> 00:38:21,789
We outsmarted
them that time,

648
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:25,393
but i think we'd
better mark the map

649
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:29,196
so we don't venture
into that ring again.

650
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:32,367
We were right about
there, don't you think?

651
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:37,538
I think we've covered enough
ground for one day, don't you?

652
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:42,043
Tell me, do you
still hear the music?

653
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:44,545
Yes.

654
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:47,081
½ ll-de-di... ½

655
00:38:47,183 --> 00:38:49,183
½ la-la-la-la-la-la-la... ½

656
00:38:58,694 --> 00:39:01,295
What are you
humming, honey?

657
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:03,765
I'm humming
to the fairies' music.

658
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:04,733
The what?

659
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:07,135
The crickets and
owls and the wind.

660
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:09,236
Ohh.

661
00:39:13,275 --> 00:39:15,610
Darn.

662
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:17,311
Maybe
a fairy did it.

663
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:19,914
Maybe a chicken bone
fell in.

664
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,984
See? A bone.

665
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:24,419
No fairy.

666
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,355
Maybe a fairy
put it there.

667
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:30,124
A fairy didn't
put it there.

668
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:31,192
I did.

669
00:39:31,193 --> 00:39:33,661
Probably because i
wasn't paying attention.

670
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,762
Maybe a fairy
distracted you.

671
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:38,800
A fairy had nothing
to do with this.

672
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:40,268
Alex, you
know better.

673
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:42,503
There are no such
things as fairies.

674
00:39:42,604 --> 00:39:44,604
But how do
you know that?

675
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:48,676
Because, i say so.

676
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,878
Now enough
of this nonsense.

677
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:55,683
Well, because... there's no
scientific evidence they exist.

678
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:59,320
Not yet,
but where would we be

679
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:02,023
if people didn't believe
in creatures so small

680
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:04,025
you couldn't see
them with your eyes.

681
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,726
They were laughed at.

682
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:07,896
Gosh,
i'm tired, Alex.

683
00:40:07,997 --> 00:40:13,134
And, who tells you the answer to
your test when your mind goes blank,

684
00:40:13,235 --> 00:40:15,670
and all of the sudden
it comes back to you

685
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:19,407
as though somebody whispered
it to you in your ear?

686
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,876
Maybe you
should study law.

687
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:30,919
Oh, i see him.

688
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,688
Yeah, and he's being
chased by a caterpillar.

689
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:35,090
Where's the legs?

690
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:36,590
Oh, i see him, yes!

691
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:39,461
Wait a minute,
he's a tyrannosaurs.

692
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,462
Well, hello there.

693
00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:43,564
Would you
like to join us?

694
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:46,701
I said, would you like
to see the parade with us?

695
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:50,205
Yeah, you just missed
the catapilla-saurus.

696
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:51,705
I think
i'll pass.

697
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:54,175
Aunt sam
wants you guys.

698
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:56,276
Oh, it's time
to go, then.

699
00:40:56,311 --> 00:40:57,311
Oh, man...

700
00:40:57,312 --> 00:40:59,613
the parade will be
back another day.

701
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:01,714
Wanna race me home? Yeah!

702
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,456
How about helping an
old man to his feet?

703
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:11,792
Up we go.

704
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:14,596
Hello,
i'm liam conners.

705
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,599
The leprechaun.

706
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:22,704
I guess you've been
talking to Alex and Tommy.

707
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:25,807
You must be Tommy's
sister, becky.

708
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:28,442
We were just looking
at the clouds.

709
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:31,478
There's so much
to see up there.

710
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,347
In the clouds?

711
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:35,483
Aye, you have to
know how to look.

712
00:41:35,584 --> 00:41:38,052
Look again.

713
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:44,725
Do you see that little
girl floating in the air?

714
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:46,826
Yeah, i guess i do see her.

715
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,299
Aye, but she looks
sad and lonely

716
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,936
as if she misses someone
who was very special to her.

717
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:59,107
My boyfriend never called
yesterday to wish me happy birthday.

718
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,275
Oh, but a lovely
lass like that...

719
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:03,344
she must have
many friends.

720
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:07,415
No, i think this is someone
who's very special to her

721
00:42:07,516 --> 00:42:09,584
who she's
angry at.

722
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:11,752
Who might
that be?

723
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:13,853
My dad.

724
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:16,190
If he hadn't died
then i wouldn't be here,

725
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,693
alone and forgotten
on my birthday.

726
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:20,027
I wish i was home.

727
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:21,662
Now, don't
be like that,

728
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:23,697
always wishing you
were somewhere else.

729
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:25,933
You're missing out
on what's here.

730
00:42:26,034 --> 00:42:27,335
Here?

731
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,636
What's here!

732
00:42:28,637 --> 00:42:30,637
There's not
even a mall.

733
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,673
What good is a mall?

734
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:36,143
A place to go out
with my friends.

735
00:42:36,244 --> 00:42:39,747
Well tell me, what did
you do at this mall?

736
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:40,881
I dunno.

737
00:42:40,882 --> 00:42:42,150
Just hung out.

738
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:45,920
Oh, i see. You did
nothing at the mall.

739
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:51,059
You could be doing
the same thing here.

740
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,494
What else?

741
00:42:53,595 --> 00:42:55,763
What do you mean
what else?

742
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,700
What else do
you like to do?

743
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:02,336
You know, i've learned
everyone has a secret wish

744
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:04,371
deep down
in their hearts.

745
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:06,372
Something they
want to do

746
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:08,442
more than anything
else in the world,

747
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:11,012
if only they had
the courage to try.

748
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:16,650
I guess i always wanted to
learn how to ride a horse.

749
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:17,852
Ahhh...

750
00:43:17,853 --> 00:43:18,653
what?

751
00:43:18,654 --> 00:43:19,987
Yes, i know.

752
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:21,122
No, i... yes,

753
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:23,391
no, no...
i quite agree.

754
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:25,226
Who are you
talking to?

755
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,360
Listen.

756
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:28,162
I don't hear
anything.

757
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:30,999
Nothing?

758
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,399
The wind?

759
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,303
Aye. I frequently
ask the wind for help

760
00:43:36,404 --> 00:43:39,007
when i have
a problem.

761
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:40,975
Does it
ever answer?

762
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:45,546
Aye, if you're patient
and sincere in the asking.

763
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:49,850
The wind always answers in
its own way and its own time.

764
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:52,553
Maybe i should try.

765
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:56,290
Aye, lass,
maybe you should.

766
00:44:07,036 --> 00:44:08,235
Did you hear it?

767
00:44:08,236 --> 00:44:11,705
I hear the breeze,
but i don't hear any words.

768
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:12,940
Aye, lass.

769
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,510
It isn't easy,
but this i know,

770
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:19,280
when it's truly important
for you to hear

771
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:21,415
what the wind
has to say,

772
00:44:21,516 --> 00:44:23,051
you'll hear it.

773
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:27,422
But you won't
hear it here,

774
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:31,459
you'll hear
it right here.

775
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,762
And with practice
it gets easier.

776
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:38,332
Then you can
ask it anything...

777
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:40,935
what to do
on a sunny day,

778
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:44,572
the answers
to your problems,

779
00:44:44,673 --> 00:44:48,542
how to fill the
emptiness in your heart.

780
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:51,712
How does
the wind know?

781
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:55,583
The wind is only
the messenger.

782
00:44:55,684 --> 00:44:57,651
But how does...

783
00:44:57,652 --> 00:45:01,088
mr. Conners?

784
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:03,189
Mr. Conners?

785
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:11,299
I'm afraid of horses.

786
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:19,038
You see it?

787
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,006
Yeah.

788
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:21,341
It's a bird.

789
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:24,510
Hey, that looks like
where my nest was.

790
00:45:24,612 --> 00:45:26,445
You guys, c'mon.
Lunch is ready.

791
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:28,147
Last one to the
porch is a pooka!

792
00:45:28,148 --> 00:45:29,249
Go!

793
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,250
That's not fair!
No way!

794
00:45:32,553 --> 00:45:34,120
I won!
You're the pooka.

795
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:36,022
You got
a head start.

796
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:37,457
I'm not the
pooka, you are.

797
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:39,825
I won. That means
i'm not the pooka.

798
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:41,227
Yes, you are.

799
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:42,795
I'm probably going
to be sorry i asked,

800
00:45:42,796 --> 00:45:44,364
but what's
a pooka?

801
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:46,866
The pooka is a bad fairy
that looks like a horse

802
00:45:46,967 --> 00:45:49,235
that takes you on a ride
that you'll never survive

803
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:51,304
unless you're
very, very brave.

804
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:53,973
Oh yeah? I'd say neither
of you are pookas.

805
00:45:54,074 --> 00:45:56,074
Come on.

806
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:58,277
Wait, i left
ace in the tree.

807
00:45:58,378 --> 00:45:59,345
Get him later.

808
00:45:59,346 --> 00:46:02,548
No, we have to
be ready to fly.

809
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:05,084
What?

810
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:07,520
Scott and cindy?

811
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:10,089
I don't believe it!

812
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,757
That's just
great, lori.

813
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:14,060
Yeah, thanks for calling.

814
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:19,899
Now i know what kind
of friends i have.

815
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,002
One less question
for the wind, i guess.

816
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,381
Where to now?

817
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:37,951
I'd say that way.

818
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,727
Hold it! Hold it!

819
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:49,162
What's wrong?

820
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:52,231
I'm not sure, but i
just got a funny feeling.

821
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:54,300
Do you feel
anything different?

822
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:56,569
Sorta.
Sorta.

823
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,138
Aye, i thought so.

824
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:01,941
We'd better put our
jackets on backwards.

825
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:05,512
Why are we
doing this?

826
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:06,779
Pixies!

827
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,881
We don't want to
get pixie-led in there.

828
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,982
Pixie-led?

829
00:47:11,051 --> 00:47:12,018
Aye.

830
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:13,853
Have you ever
been on a trip

831
00:47:13,854 --> 00:47:15,888
and suddenly the trip was over

832
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:17,924
you can't even
remember the trip?

833
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:19,592
Yeah, that
happened to me

834
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:21,528
on the way to
grandma's last year.

835
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:24,664
More than likely a pixie
caught your attention.

836
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:26,832
You were
pixie-led, Tommy!

837
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:28,868
That doesn't
sound so bad.

838
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:30,669
That's only
the first step.

839
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,573
Given enough time, a pixie
will get you so confused

840
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:37,343
that you'll start looking for
happiness in all the wrong places.

841
00:47:37,444 --> 00:47:39,278
And once you
get pixie-led,

842
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:40,646
unless someone
else helps,

843
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:42,315
you could stay
lost forever.

844
00:47:42,316 --> 00:47:45,985
So how does it help to put
our coats on backwards?

845
00:47:46,086 --> 00:47:48,086
Don't you see,
it confuses them.

846
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:51,524
They can't tell whether
we're coming or going.

847
00:47:56,096 --> 00:47:58,164
Bring the map.

848
00:48:04,438 --> 00:48:06,438
Ready for bed?

849
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:12,378
You still miss him,
don't you?

850
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:15,748
Yeah, i wish he'd
hurry and come back.

851
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:19,451
Tommy, you know
that he can't...

852
00:48:19,553 --> 00:48:22,922
i mean you do know
where your dad really is?

853
00:48:23,023 --> 00:48:24,724
He's in...
heaven.

854
00:48:24,725 --> 00:48:26,425
That's
right.

855
00:48:26,426 --> 00:48:29,362
And when people go to
heaven they don't come back.

856
00:48:29,463 --> 00:48:32,198
But he always
comes back.

857
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:34,433
He promised
he'd come back.

858
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:36,736
Ace was
his witness.

859
00:48:36,837 --> 00:48:40,139
But what if he
can't come back?

860
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,608
Me and ace have
figured it out.

861
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:45,445
He's been pixie-led,

862
00:48:45,546 --> 00:48:49,916
we'll fix that as soon
as we find the faeden.

863
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:54,653
Good night, Tommy.

864
00:48:54,754 --> 00:48:56,989
Good night, ace.

865
00:49:13,641 --> 00:49:17,210
Boy, you're really
dragging it out, today.

866
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,612
I ain't going
in today, boys.

867
00:49:19,713 --> 00:49:21,547
Part of the plan.

868
00:49:21,548 --> 00:49:24,083
Oh yeah, the plan.

869
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:30,522
Take a look at this,
tonight is the night!

870
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,024
Good luck!

871
00:49:32,025 --> 00:49:36,062
We'll be standing by when you
get blown out of the water.

872
00:49:36,163 --> 00:49:37,764
You think so?

873
00:49:37,765 --> 00:49:39,498
I don't think so.

874
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:41,534
I'm a pretty
lucky guy.

875
00:49:41,635 --> 00:49:43,903
A man with a plan.

876
00:49:53,113 --> 00:49:56,115
Nothing today, again.

877
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:59,218
All this time i've been
dreaming of finding it

878
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:00,853
but still nothing.

879
00:50:00,854 --> 00:50:04,256
Aye, i've been dreaming
about it as well.

880
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:07,893
But maybe it was only
meant to be a dream.

881
00:50:07,994 --> 00:50:09,994
What's the point
of a dream

882
00:50:09,997 --> 00:50:11,664
if it doesn't
come true?

883
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:15,501
Now hold it,
hold on, both of you.

884
00:50:15,602 --> 00:50:19,972
What was it that christopher
columbus was dreaming of?

885
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:22,508
I know, a new way
to get to india.

886
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:25,578
Aye, and it was that dream
that gave him the courage

887
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,381
to brave the unknown
perils of the ocean.

888
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:30,816
But, he didn't find
what he was looking for.

889
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:35,587
Exactly, instead he
discovered a whole new world.

890
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:38,424
But we didn't
find anything.

891
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:40,860
Ah, didn't you now?

892
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,728
More often than not

893
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:45,798
the search proves more
valuable than the treasure.

894
00:50:45,899 --> 00:50:49,902
I promise you, you've both
found far more than you realize

895
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:52,872
and you're closer
than you think.

896
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:55,240
Come along,
then.

897
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:57,710
The faeden's
waitin'.

898
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:39,718
Don't run,
you guys.

899
00:51:41,555 --> 00:51:43,989
Did you talk
to mr. Conners today?

900
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,159
Don't answer.
It's a trap.

901
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:55,200
Ahh, you two,
hold on, hold on!

902
00:51:55,301 --> 00:51:58,804
You're wearing me out...
an old man like me.

903
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:00,905
It's time
for a rest.

904
00:52:00,941 --> 00:52:03,375
No, not there.

905
00:52:03,476 --> 00:52:05,476
Follow me.

906
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:08,047
Why out here?

907
00:52:08,148 --> 00:52:10,283
As a precaution,
of course.

908
00:52:10,383 --> 00:52:13,586
The bad fairyies can't
hurt you in moving water.

909
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,854
Who's got the map?

910
00:52:15,955 --> 00:52:19,892
Let's see
how we're doing.

911
00:52:19,993 --> 00:52:23,428
Look, only one
section left.

912
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,932
Darn, i wish
we could find it.

913
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:29,802
Shush, don't go
throwing wishes around.

914
00:52:29,903 --> 00:52:31,303
Why not?

915
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:33,172
Because they
might come true.

916
00:52:33,173 --> 00:52:35,240
What's wrong
with that?

917
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:37,743
It might not be
what you really need.

918
00:52:37,844 --> 00:52:40,179
I don't understand.

919
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,714
I once heard
of a woman

920
00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:46,952
who all of her life
wanted to be very rich.

921
00:52:47,053 --> 00:52:50,455
One day, she caught a
fairy and she got her wish.

922
00:52:50,556 --> 00:52:54,627
The next day, she got a big
check from an insurance co.

923
00:52:54,727 --> 00:52:58,630
Because her poor husband
had died in an accident.

924
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:02,968
She got her wish, but became
a lonely old widow for it.

925
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:05,069
It's the nature
of fairy magic.

926
00:53:05,071 --> 00:53:07,539
They can't give
without taking.

927
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,809
Well then, what
should we wish for?

928
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,212
If you must
wish for something,

929
00:53:13,313 --> 00:53:17,850
wish for strength of heart,
inspiration and courage.

930
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:22,421
Always wish for things
you're willing to work for.

931
00:53:22,522 --> 00:53:25,992
What if a fairy wish was the
only way a wish could come true?

932
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:31,463
Then you're wishing for
things that shouldn't be.

933
00:53:31,564 --> 00:53:35,367
I still wish i could
find the faeden.

934
00:53:35,468 --> 00:53:42,041
Well in that case, i'll just have
to make sure you get your wish.

935
00:53:42,142 --> 00:53:44,677
Promise?

936
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:49,215
With ace as my
witness, i promise.

937
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:19,745
The banshees!

938
00:54:19,846 --> 00:54:22,014
No, not yet,
i tell you.

939
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:24,116
I need more time!

940
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:36,528
Mr. Conners,
are you okay?

941
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,631
I'm okay.
I'm all right, dear.

942
00:54:38,732 --> 00:54:41,534
Just lost my breath
for a moment.

943
00:54:47,307 --> 00:54:49,608
What's the banshee?

944
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,343
The banshee?

945
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:54,280
Well, it's a
messenger of sorts.

946
00:54:54,381 --> 00:54:57,249
What did it say?

947
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,885
It said
i may be goin' away.

948
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:02,121
Where will
you be going?

949
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:03,622
Where the
wind lives.

950
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:04,523
No.

951
00:55:04,524 --> 00:55:05,992
You promised.

952
00:55:05,993 --> 00:55:10,062
I didn't say it would
be easy now, did i?

953
00:55:10,163 --> 00:55:12,631
Do you still want
to find the faeden?

954
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:15,634
You've learned to
trust your hearts

955
00:55:15,735 --> 00:55:17,803
and believe in things
you can't always see?

956
00:55:17,904 --> 00:55:22,208
What happens now is all
up to you, don't you see?

957
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:24,610
I was only
your guide.

958
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:26,746
You don't
need me anymore.

959
00:55:26,846 --> 00:55:28,846
But we'll miss you.

960
00:55:28,915 --> 00:55:31,917
Aye, i'll
miss you, too.

961
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:37,990
But don't be sad. There's
a purpose to everything.

962
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:41,527
Close your eyes.

963
00:55:41,628 --> 00:55:43,795
Do you remember
the morning

964
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:48,000
when we danced
to the fairies' music?

965
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:50,101
Tell me what
you see and hear.

966
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:51,870
The birds.

967
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:54,706
The fields and the
woods... the forest.

968
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:56,441
Anything else?

969
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:58,442
I see Tommy... and you.

970
00:55:58,712 --> 00:56:02,647
Tommy, do you
see me, too?

971
00:56:02,748 --> 00:56:04,748
Yeah.

972
00:56:04,784 --> 00:56:07,085
Whenever you need
to see me,

973
00:56:07,186 --> 00:56:10,289
all you have to do is
to close your eyes,

974
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,626
listen for the
music of the meadow

975
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:16,128
and i'll be there.

976
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:38,984
Storm's coming in.

977
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:44,990
I cannot believe
you took me to a drive-in.

978
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:46,659
It was fun,
though.

979
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,660
It was okay.

980
00:56:49,963 --> 00:56:52,698
What was the name
of the movie?

981
00:56:55,902 --> 00:56:58,504
I knew you were
having a good time.

982
00:56:58,605 --> 00:56:59,371
A falling star!

983
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:00,873
Make a wish... hurry!

984
00:57:00,874 --> 00:57:02,241
Oh no,
not you, too!

985
00:57:02,242 --> 00:57:04,309
What?

986
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,312
Oh, it's Alex.

987
00:57:06,313 --> 00:57:09,381
Seems like since she's started
spending time with mr. Conners,

988
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:12,718
she can't stop talking
about fairies and magic.

989
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:14,186
What's wrong
with that?

990
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:15,654
She's eight years old.

991
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:16,855
She's got a
great imagination.

992
00:57:16,856 --> 00:57:17,890
What's wrong
with it?

993
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:19,458
Yeah.

994
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:22,094
The other day she
takes one of her books

995
00:57:22,195 --> 00:57:24,029
and renames
everything in it.

996
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,632
She crosses out
tree and writes "house."

997
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:29,101
She calls
the acorns "dinner"...

998
00:57:29,202 --> 00:57:32,638
because she thinks she's
been changed into a squirrel.

999
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,973
I must have
missed something.

1000
00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:36,475
I don't get
the problem.

1001
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:40,112
The problem is what if she
starts believing this stuff?

1002
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:42,948
Starts believing
in fairies and magic

1003
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:45,484
and inanimate objects
that are alive.

1004
00:57:45,585 --> 00:57:47,018
She's having fun.

1005
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:47,853
Fun?

1006
00:57:47,854 --> 00:57:49,955
I don't think
it's fun.

1007
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:52,824
I don't want Alex
believing in fairy tales,

1008
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:57,563
and men in shining armor
and prince charming.

1009
00:57:57,664 --> 00:58:01,867
Don't you think you're going
a bit overboard with this?

1010
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:05,003
What's wrong with a girl
believing in the dream

1011
00:58:05,104 --> 00:58:07,172
that a wish
will come true?

1012
00:58:07,273 --> 00:58:08,340
What's wrong
with it?

1013
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:09,174
Yeah.

1014
00:58:09,175 --> 00:58:11,175
How about what's
going to happen

1015
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,779
when some of those wishes
don't come true, huh?

1016
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,881
I just think
that we can do

1017
00:58:15,982 --> 00:58:18,517
without the fairy tales
in my house.

1018
00:58:18,618 --> 00:58:20,786
Unless they're
your fairy tales.

1019
00:58:20,887 --> 00:58:22,887
What are you
talking about?

1020
00:58:22,956 --> 00:58:26,791
How about the one
that everything in life

1021
00:58:26,892 --> 00:58:28,961
can be explained rationally
or scientifically?

1022
00:58:29,062 --> 00:58:30,362
Oh, come on.

1023
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:33,065
How about why her dad
never comes to visit her.

1024
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,033
Try those fairy
tales, sam.

1025
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:39,437
That's enough. I
think you'd better go.

1026
00:58:44,644 --> 00:58:47,812
I'd never tell
a little girl

1027
00:58:47,914 --> 00:58:50,649
that prince charming is
going to come into her life,

1028
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:54,219
kiss her and take
all her troubles away.

1029
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:56,555
Come on.

1030
00:58:56,656 --> 00:58:59,224
Maybe i do believe
there's a...

1031
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:01,325
are you done?

1032
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:05,964
Just forget
it, okay?

1033
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:09,001
Fine. Forget it!

1034
00:59:09,102 --> 00:59:11,803
No, as a matter of fact,
i'm not done.

1035
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:15,573
Just because you lost
all your hopes and dreams

1036
00:59:15,675 --> 00:59:17,276
doesn't give
you the right

1037
00:59:17,277 --> 00:59:20,312
to keep Alex from
having any of hers.

1038
00:59:23,149 --> 00:59:25,149
Now i'm done.

1039
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,140
Why'd i ever put
you up there.

1040
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:53,679
No angel has ever
listened to my prayers.

1041
01:00:06,225 --> 01:00:09,060
Can i talk to you for
a minute, mr. Conners?

1042
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:12,398
Yes, i'm always willing
to listen and help.

1043
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:15,768
That's what i want
to talk to you about.

1044
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:18,537
You're not helping anybody
with all of your stories.

1045
01:00:18,638 --> 01:00:22,240
Now why would you be
saying a thing like that?

1046
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:24,843
Because i'm concerned
about the effect

1047
01:00:24,944 --> 01:00:28,981
you and your stories are having
on the children's reality.

1048
01:00:29,082 --> 01:00:31,082
Their reality?

1049
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:36,956
It's their reality that's
been harming them, miss gayle.

1050
01:00:37,057 --> 01:00:38,824
A little boy
who waits

1051
01:00:38,825 --> 01:00:41,292
for a father
who can't return.

1052
01:00:41,394 --> 01:00:43,394
A little girl
who believes that science

1053
01:00:43,463 --> 01:00:45,163
can answer
all her questions.

1054
01:00:45,164 --> 01:00:46,965
And a teen
who's afraid to dream

1055
01:00:46,966 --> 01:00:48,966
for fear of what
her dreams may contain.

1056
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:50,435
You sound just
like rick.

1057
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:52,871
Aye, and a fine
man he is

1058
01:00:52,973 --> 01:00:54,606
with both feet
on the ground.

1059
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,141
Both feet!

1060
01:00:56,142 --> 01:00:57,442
He's a dreamer.

1061
01:00:57,443 --> 01:01:01,046
I don't think he even has
one foot on the ground.

1062
01:01:02,615 --> 01:01:05,483
Miss gayle...

1063
01:01:05,584 --> 01:01:12,257
try to focus for a moment
on the miracle of two words...

1064
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:15,127
"what if?"

1065
01:01:15,228 --> 01:01:16,729
What if?

1066
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:20,532
Aye, "what if?"

1067
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:23,335
Isn't it those two words
that lead the scientists

1068
01:01:23,436 --> 01:01:24,837
to new discoveries,

1069
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:27,806
the dreamer
to new worlds,

1070
01:01:27,907 --> 01:01:29,941
the weary to hope.

1071
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:34,112
Where do your stories about
leprechauns and fairies lead?

1072
01:01:34,213 --> 01:01:38,149
I hope they lead to
that place in the heart

1073
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:42,187
that reality
can't touch.

1074
01:01:42,288 --> 01:01:45,123
Do you remember?

1075
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:48,927
What if?

1076
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:54,666
Aye, what if.

1077
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,767
Go ahead.

1078
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:59,705
Try it.

1079
01:01:59,806 --> 01:02:03,375
I'm sure there's dreams
still living in your heart.

1080
01:02:03,476 --> 01:02:10,048
Allow yourself to feel
them, just one more time.

1081
01:02:12,152 --> 01:02:16,522
Aye, i see you
found the spot.

1082
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:22,627
Go ahead, miss gayle.

1083
01:02:23,663 --> 01:02:25,997
Let your
heart believe...

1084
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:32,237
believe even that
there may be angels

1085
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:34,706
right here in erinville

1086
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:38,576
that do hear and
answer your prayers.

1087
01:02:57,563 --> 01:02:59,998
Something is wrong
with mr. Conners.

1088
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:02,100
Like what?

1089
01:03:12,178 --> 01:03:17,415
B-a-n-s-h-e-e...

1090
01:03:17,516 --> 01:03:23,455
A spirit whose wailing
foretells a coming death.

1091
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:25,556
Death?

1092
01:03:38,204 --> 01:03:40,505
What are you doing?

1093
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:42,607
Listening to the wind.

1094
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,643
Is it sayin' anything?

1095
01:03:45,744 --> 01:03:48,447
Yeah, that i pick
lousy friends.

1096
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:53,084
Still upset about scott not
calling on your birthday?

1097
01:03:53,185 --> 01:03:55,854
I'm sure he was
just... probably out.

1098
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:59,190
Yeah, out with my
best friend, cindy.

1099
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,059
Lori called
and told me.

1100
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,528
Honey, i'm sorry.

1101
01:04:03,629 --> 01:04:08,700
Well, maybe this
is for the best?

1102
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:11,102
What do you mean?

1103
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:12,971
I suggested
to your mother

1104
01:04:12,972 --> 01:04:15,140
that maybe you should
all move up here.

1105
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:18,843
It might make all our
lives a little easier.

1106
01:04:18,944 --> 01:04:21,980
She didn't say anything
to me about it.

1107
01:04:22,081 --> 01:04:24,082
We were waiting.

1108
01:04:24,183 --> 01:04:26,284
We figured once got here,
you wouldn't want to leave.

1109
01:04:26,385 --> 01:04:28,220
Yeah, right!

1110
01:04:28,221 --> 01:04:31,222
It's just something
to think about.

1111
01:04:31,324 --> 01:04:33,925
I'll ask
the wind.

1112
01:04:34,026 --> 01:04:37,862
Think it could answer
a few questions for me?

1113
01:04:37,963 --> 01:04:40,766
Couldn't hurt to try.

1114
01:05:00,787 --> 01:05:02,387
Hi, bill.

1115
01:05:02,388 --> 01:05:04,089
Hold on a second.

1116
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:07,158
Kids,
time for dinner.

1117
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:12,898
What brings
you about tonight?

1118
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:17,069
I know the kids have been seeing
a lot of mr. Conners, lately.

1119
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:19,137
So, i thought
you should know.

1120
01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:21,272
Liam's had a heart attack.

1121
01:05:21,373 --> 01:05:23,373
Is he going
to be okay?

1122
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:26,778
They're not sure.
He's pretty bad.

1123
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:30,114
What am i going
to tell the kids?

1124
01:05:31,818 --> 01:05:34,452
If you want,
i can tell them.

1125
01:05:34,553 --> 01:05:36,553
Tell who what?

1126
01:05:38,324 --> 01:05:41,592
Alex... Tommy...

1127
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:44,096
come sit by me.

1128
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:47,230
Tell us what?

1129
01:05:48,835 --> 01:05:50,902
Mr. Conners
is sick.

1130
01:05:51,003 --> 01:05:52,304
Sick?

1131
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:54,005
What do you mean?

1132
01:05:54,006 --> 01:05:56,909
He had a heart attack
and is in the hospital.

1133
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:59,044
Is he going
to die?

1134
01:05:59,145 --> 01:06:00,646
He may.

1135
01:06:00,647 --> 01:06:02,647
No!

1136
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:06,551
Honey,
i'm sorry.

1137
01:06:31,043 --> 01:06:32,778
Alex?

1138
01:06:32,779 --> 01:06:34,779
Yeah?

1139
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:39,551
What are you doing?

1140
01:06:39,652 --> 01:06:41,385
We have to
find the faeden.

1141
01:06:41,386 --> 01:06:43,488
We have to
find it, tonight.

1142
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:45,823
We can't. It's dark.

1143
01:06:45,924 --> 01:06:47,826
We'll look tomorrow.

1144
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:50,461
No, maybe it
will be too late.

1145
01:06:50,562 --> 01:06:52,998
We have to
find it, tonight.

1146
01:06:53,899 --> 01:06:55,533
Wait!

1147
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:58,303
I'm going with you.

1148
01:07:31,637 --> 01:07:35,507
Alex, Alex?

1149
01:07:51,691 --> 01:07:53,691
Tommy?

1150
01:08:08,674 --> 01:08:11,943
The sooner we go, the
sooner we get back.

1151
01:08:12,044 --> 01:08:14,746
The woods look
scary in the dark.

1152
01:08:14,847 --> 01:08:18,115
Let's get ready.

1153
01:08:33,565 --> 01:08:34,933
Ready?

1154
01:08:34,934 --> 01:08:36,934
Ready!

1155
01:08:37,537 --> 01:08:39,537
Let's go find it.

1156
01:08:47,947 --> 01:08:50,314
Becky?

1157
01:08:50,315 --> 01:08:51,316
Huh?

1158
01:08:51,317 --> 01:08:53,317
Have you seen
Tommy and Alex?

1159
01:08:53,352 --> 01:08:54,819
No.

1160
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:57,155
I better call rick.

1161
01:08:57,256 --> 01:08:59,991
Got any idea where
they might be?

1162
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,160
Hi rick, it's me.

1163
01:09:03,162 --> 01:09:05,162
The kids are gone.

1164
01:09:08,968 --> 01:09:10,535
This way.

1165
01:09:10,536 --> 01:09:11,669
Are you sure?

1166
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:14,205
Yeah. I think.

1167
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:19,177
Yeah,
okay. C'mon.

1168
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,117
It's all right.

1169
01:09:26,118 --> 01:09:27,685
I promise you
we'll find them.

1170
01:09:27,686 --> 01:09:29,387
They're good kids
hiding somewhere.

1171
01:09:29,388 --> 01:09:31,389
We just have to
figure out where.

1172
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,958
I've called the firehouse,
the hospital,

1173
01:09:34,059 --> 01:09:36,059
and checked all the roads
to get there.

1174
01:09:36,061 --> 01:09:38,563
We're going to have
to search the woods.

1175
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:39,964
All right,
let's do it.

1176
01:09:39,965 --> 01:09:42,466
You get the guys together
and let's get moving on it.

1177
01:09:42,568 --> 01:09:46,337
Hey, c'mon, it's
going to be all right.

1178
01:09:46,438 --> 01:09:49,207
We'll find them. I
promise you, all right?

1179
01:09:49,308 --> 01:09:50,908
Okay?

1180
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:52,909
Okay.

1181
01:09:56,048 --> 01:09:59,384
Tommy, i think we'd better
stop and check the map.

1182
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:01,485
Okay.

1183
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:11,496
Do you think you know
where we are?

1184
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:15,934
No. I don't
recognize anything.

1185
01:10:16,035 --> 01:10:18,436
We might have
been pixie-led.

1186
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:23,508
Now what?

1187
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:27,979
If we're lost, i think we
should stay right where we are.

1188
01:10:40,826 --> 01:10:43,261
<i>But this i do know...</i>

1189
01:10:43,362 --> 01:10:46,397
<i>when it's important
enough for you to hear</i>

1190
01:10:46,498 --> 01:10:48,366
<i>what the wind
has to say,</i>

1191
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:50,568
<i>you'll hear it.</i>

1192
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:00,710
Mr. Conners...

1193
01:11:05,451 --> 01:11:08,219
okay,
you know the drill.

1194
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,122
It's going to be tough
to see because of this rain.

1195
01:11:11,223 --> 01:11:13,224
Work your area thoroughly.

1196
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:16,027
Let's follow
all standard procedure.

1197
01:11:16,128 --> 01:11:18,863
Let's not forget
that these 2 kids

1198
01:11:18,964 --> 01:11:24,102
are cold and tired and
probably huddled up somewhere.

1199
01:11:24,203 --> 01:11:27,205
Keep your eyes peeled.

1200
01:11:27,306 --> 01:11:29,441
God be with us all

1201
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:31,541
and good luck!

1202
01:11:46,925 --> 01:11:48,159
What was that?

1203
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,927
Just the wind.

1204
01:11:49,928 --> 01:11:52,564
We've got to
get out of here.

1205
01:11:52,665 --> 01:11:54,765
But which way
do we go?

1206
01:11:54,866 --> 01:11:56,735
Let's turn around
and go back.

1207
01:11:56,736 --> 01:11:59,837
But which wy
is back?

1208
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:01,705
The banshees!

1209
01:12:01,706 --> 01:12:03,706
They're after us!

1210
01:12:05,077 --> 01:12:06,310
The pooka!

1211
01:12:06,311 --> 01:12:07,512
The one who
got the robber!

1212
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:09,513
Let's go!

1213
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:23,995
Deputy, grab a
couple of people.

1214
01:12:24,096 --> 01:12:26,831
Check that ravine
over there.

1215
01:12:37,176 --> 01:12:38,509
What have you got?

1216
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:40,178
Nothing to the north.

1217
01:12:40,179 --> 01:12:42,580
Make sure you
get up on the south ridge.

1218
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:47,585
Look under rocks. There's a lot
of holes they could be hiding in.

1219
01:12:47,686 --> 01:12:49,686
Alex!

1220
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:53,158
What's that sound?

1221
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:55,159
It sounds like water.

1222
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,427
The stream!

1223
01:12:56,428 --> 01:12:59,230
The bad fairies can't hurt
us if we're in the water.

1224
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:01,331
Let's go!

1225
01:13:03,502 --> 01:13:05,502
Tommy!

1226
01:13:10,976 --> 01:13:12,911
We have to
go across.

1227
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:16,047
But we don't know
how deep it is.

1228
01:13:16,148 --> 01:13:19,150
Do you think the
pooka will get us?

1229
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:21,219
I don't know.

1230
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,354
Do you think
we lost them?

1231
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,423
Maybe.

1232
01:13:25,424 --> 01:13:27,692
I think we
should wade.

1233
01:13:27,793 --> 01:13:32,230
Stay close to the side
and follow the stream?

1234
01:13:32,331 --> 01:13:34,098
Okay?
Okay.

1235
01:13:34,099 --> 01:13:36,401
C'mon!

1236
01:13:49,515 --> 01:13:51,949
Be careful!

1237
01:13:52,051 --> 01:13:54,051
Look out!

1238
01:13:55,187 --> 01:13:58,022
Help! Help!

1239
01:13:58,123 --> 01:14:00,123
Grab the log!

1240
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:07,331
Meg, what's that?

1241
01:14:07,366 --> 01:14:10,100
Bill,
i've got something.

1242
01:14:10,202 --> 01:14:11,669
Yeah, meg,
what is it?

1243
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,805
It looks like
a metal detector

1244
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:16,174
and a couple
pair of glasses.

1245
01:14:18,043 --> 01:14:20,345
Help! Help!

1246
01:14:23,549 --> 01:14:25,416
I need to see
liam conners.

1247
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,718
Visiting hours aren't
until 9:00 a. m.

1248
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,387
No, you
don't understand.

1249
01:14:29,388 --> 01:14:31,222
Is there a problem
i can help you with?

1250
01:14:31,223 --> 01:14:33,291
Yes, i need to
see mr. Conners.

1251
01:14:33,392 --> 01:14:35,827
My brother is lost and
he may know where he is.

1252
01:14:35,928 --> 01:14:37,995
Help! Help!

1253
01:14:38,096 --> 01:14:40,096
Help! Help!

1254
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:46,103
Trail ends here!

1255
01:14:46,104 --> 01:14:46,971
You sure?

1256
01:14:46,972 --> 01:14:48,972
Yeah.

1257
01:14:50,408 --> 01:14:54,211
Tommy!

1258
01:14:54,312 --> 01:14:57,915
Take the dogs up there
where it narrows.

1259
01:14:58,016 --> 01:15:01,085
See if you can't pick
up a scent over there.

1260
01:15:01,186 --> 01:15:03,287
Bill and i will
go down river.

1261
01:15:03,388 --> 01:15:05,523
You know where
this river goes?

1262
01:15:09,762 --> 01:15:11,996
Help!
Help somebody! Help!

1263
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:15,566
Help! Please!

1264
01:15:27,412 --> 01:15:28,646
Tommy's?

1265
01:15:28,647 --> 01:15:30,080
Yeah.

1266
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:31,983
I'm going to
cross here

1267
01:15:31,984 --> 01:15:34,318
and work my way
down to the falls.

1268
01:15:34,419 --> 01:15:36,688
Mr. Conners?

1269
01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:39,523
Mr. Conners,
it's becky.

1270
01:15:39,624 --> 01:15:41,659
It's about
Tommy and Alex.

1271
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,829
I think they went to search
the last part of the woods.

1272
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:48,599
I was hoping you'd
know where that was.

1273
01:15:53,072 --> 01:15:55,473
Follow the rainbow.

1274
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:02,512
Let him sleep.

1275
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,850
The medication
makes him hallucinate.

1276
01:16:30,308 --> 01:16:32,343
Where are we?

1277
01:16:32,444 --> 01:16:35,012
Behind
the waterfall.

1278
01:16:35,113 --> 01:16:40,017
We were lucky the log
caught onto the rock.

1279
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,056
What do we do now?

1280
01:16:45,157 --> 01:16:47,191
We can't go forward

1281
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:50,794
and we can't go back
the way we came.

1282
01:16:50,896 --> 01:16:54,531
I guess we'll
just have to wait.

1283
01:16:54,633 --> 01:16:58,101
I hope ace is okay.

1284
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:36,607
<i>Believe that there are angels
right here in erinville.</i>

1285
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:40,277
<i>That do hear and
answer your prayers.</i>

1286
01:17:40,379 --> 01:17:44,181
Dear god, please,

1287
01:17:44,283 --> 01:17:46,450
please help them.

1288
01:18:03,001 --> 01:18:05,637
The rainbow!

1289
01:18:21,987 --> 01:18:25,723
I don't think anyone's
gonna find us, here.

1290
01:18:25,824 --> 01:18:28,559
If only we
had the faeden,

1291
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:32,330
then we could
wish our way out.

1292
01:18:32,431 --> 01:18:35,132
Look, what's that?

1293
01:18:35,233 --> 01:18:37,702
I don't know.

1294
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,192
Liam patrick conners...

1295
01:19:03,395 --> 01:19:05,630
mr. Conners!

1296
01:19:05,731 --> 01:19:07,731
Open it!

1297
01:19:11,803 --> 01:19:13,838
That's it!

1298
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:17,842
The faeden,
we found it.

1299
01:19:17,943 --> 01:19:21,879
Just like
mr. Conners promised.

1300
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:25,116
Now we can
get our wishes.

1301
01:19:47,405 --> 01:19:50,841
Go ahead, Alex,
make your wish.

1302
01:19:52,444 --> 01:19:56,480
I don't know how
to use it, do you?

1303
01:19:56,581 --> 01:19:58,882
No.

1304
01:19:58,983 --> 01:20:01,185
Oh, that's right.

1305
01:20:01,286 --> 01:20:04,588
Mr. Conners said the
faeden was useless

1306
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:07,224
unless you know
how to work it.

1307
01:20:07,325 --> 01:20:09,325
Oh great!

1308
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:14,031
Tommy, why was
it so important

1309
01:20:14,133 --> 01:20:17,668
that you found
the faeden anyway?

1310
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:22,372
I thought it was the only
way i could get my wish.

1311
01:20:22,473 --> 01:20:26,243
Great thinking.

1312
01:20:26,344 --> 01:20:29,413
If i'd known this
was going to happen,

1313
01:20:29,514 --> 01:20:31,849
i wouldn't have
wished for it.

1314
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:34,985
Sorry.
It's all my fault.

1315
01:20:41,193 --> 01:20:45,930
What did mr. Conners mean
when he said we were close?

1316
01:20:46,031 --> 01:20:49,867
We couldn't
look in here.

1317
01:20:49,968 --> 01:20:54,905
So if there's a purpose
to everything, why here...

1318
01:20:55,006 --> 01:20:57,208
...behind the waterfall?

1319
01:20:57,309 --> 01:20:59,677
There's got to be more.

1320
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:13,624
Look...

1321
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:15,625
Alex, look!

1322
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:20,730
What does
it say?

1323
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,002
When you can't hear the
music of cricket and owl,

1324
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:27,704
and the wind
isn't telling you answer,

1325
01:21:27,806 --> 01:21:30,140
when you look to the
sky and see only cloud,

1326
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:33,644
to the forest
and see only tree, play me.

1327
01:21:33,745 --> 01:21:36,914
<i>I'll open your eyes
and your heart.</i>

1328
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:39,283
<i>Once again you will
see all the wonder</i>

1329
01:21:39,384 --> 01:21:42,719
<i>of the cricket, the owl,
the cloud and the tree,</i>

1330
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:46,289
<i>and the wind-borne
song of the maker.</i>

1331
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:49,660
With hope you will see
you are never alone...

1332
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:53,164
for someone who cares
will always be there.

1333
01:21:53,265 --> 01:21:57,201
<i>One wish of the heart,
a child's simple plea,</i>

1334
01:21:57,302 --> 01:22:00,070
<i>each heard the same
if you play...</i>

1335
01:22:00,171 --> 01:22:02,171
and believe.

1336
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,420
Tommy?

1337
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,690
Alex?

1338
01:22:26,631 --> 01:22:29,066
You said,
"follow the rainbow."

1339
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,069
I followed it.
So, where are they?

1340
01:22:53,091 --> 01:22:54,992
Believe in what?

1341
01:22:54,993 --> 01:22:56,226
Magic?

1342
01:22:56,227 --> 01:22:57,995
Fairies?

1343
01:22:57,996 --> 01:22:58,996
Wishes?

1344
01:22:58,997 --> 01:23:00,831
No. Tommy,
think about it.

1345
01:23:00,832 --> 01:23:04,034
None of those things
are real.

1346
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:07,738
We have to believe
in something bigger,

1347
01:23:07,839 --> 01:23:10,608
like the power
that made everything.

1348
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:13,877
That's what mr. Conners
has been trying to tell us.

1349
01:23:13,978 --> 01:23:15,978
Okay,
but you go first.

1350
01:23:21,252 --> 01:23:23,287
We wish for
strength of heart

1351
01:23:23,388 --> 01:23:25,222
and the courage
to get out of here.

1352
01:23:25,223 --> 01:23:28,391
No, stop!

1353
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:31,162
Those are the only things mr.
Conners said we should wish for.

1354
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:33,630
That might count
as two wishes.

1355
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:36,199
You might
be right.

1356
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,804
We shouldn't
take any chances.

1357
01:23:41,706 --> 01:23:48,144
Go ahead, Tommy,
make the last wish.

1358
01:23:48,246 --> 01:23:50,246
Wish for your dad,

1359
01:23:50,248 --> 01:23:52,849
that's what you've
been waiting for.

1360
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:00,490
I wish...

1361
01:24:03,428 --> 01:24:06,063
i wish...

1362
01:24:08,266 --> 01:24:12,436
i wish that mr. Conners
can have a good, long life.

1363
01:24:16,908 --> 01:24:19,710
My dad's
dead, Alex.

1364
01:24:24,015 --> 01:24:27,051
Wishing can't
change that.

1365
01:24:31,456 --> 01:24:34,425
He's in
a better place.

1366
01:24:38,163 --> 01:24:40,397
Please be there.

1367
01:24:41,232 --> 01:24:43,467
Please help us.

1368
01:24:58,049 --> 01:25:00,550
I don't understand.

1369
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:27,244
They're behind
the waterfall.

1370
01:25:27,345 --> 01:25:30,147
Tommy! Alex!

1371
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:34,952
I'll go get help.

1372
01:25:58,443 --> 01:26:01,678
<i>The pooka is a bad fairy
that looks like a horse,</i>

1373
01:26:01,779 --> 01:26:05,148
<i>and will take you on a death
ride that you'll never survive,</i>

1374
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:07,518

very brave.</i>

1375

deep down in their hearts.</i>

1376
01:26:15,327 --> 01:26:18,462
<i>Something they want to do more
than anything else in the world...</i>

1377
01:26:18,563 --> 01:26:22,633
<i>if only they had
the courage to try.</i>

1378
01:26:47,992 --> 01:26:49,359
I found them!

1379
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,562
Hold on! Calm down.

1380
01:26:51,663 --> 01:26:52,796
Where are they?

1381
01:26:52,797 --> 01:26:54,797
Behind the waterfall
at the mountains.

1382
01:26:54,799 --> 01:26:57,667
Hold on.
Take it easy.

1383
01:26:57,769 --> 01:26:59,870
Rick. This is ted.

1384
01:26:59,971 --> 01:27:01,772
I think i've got
something for you.

1385
01:27:01,773 --> 01:27:03,073
Are they okay?

1386
01:27:03,074 --> 01:27:06,009
I don't know,
they're in the waterfall.

1387
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:10,881
Yeah, go ahead, ted.

1388
01:27:10,982 --> 01:27:13,951
Yeah, becky is here,
says she found the kids.

1389
01:27:14,052 --> 01:27:15,986
Are they okay?

1390
01:27:15,987 --> 01:27:19,456
I don't know, she says
they're in a waterfall.

1391
01:27:22,594 --> 01:27:24,127
Let me talk to her.

1392
01:27:24,128 --> 01:27:27,064
Rick, they're
at the waterfall.

1393
01:27:27,165 --> 01:27:29,099
Becky, i was
just there.

1394
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,467
Tell me
where they are.

1395
01:27:30,468 --> 01:27:32,002
They're behind
the waterfall.

1396
01:27:32,003 --> 01:27:35,038
Behind the waterfall
or in the waterfall?

1397
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,107
They're behind
the waterfall.

1398
01:27:37,108 --> 01:27:40,210
Rick, crazy
leo used to tell us

1399
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:43,314
about that secret
cave behind the falls.

1400
01:27:43,415 --> 01:27:44,915
Maybe it's true.

1401
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:46,916
That's where
they are.

1402
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:48,118
The wind told me.

1403
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:50,119
Please, you've
got to believe me.

1404
01:27:50,154 --> 01:27:51,588
I believe you.

1405
01:27:51,589 --> 01:27:54,791
Ted, call old man baker
and have him

1406
01:27:54,893 --> 01:27:59,663
get his crane up
to miller falls, now.

1407
01:27:59,764 --> 01:28:01,131
Miller falls?

1408
01:28:01,132 --> 01:28:02,265
Are you crazy?

1409
01:28:02,266 --> 01:28:03,867
They'd never survive.

1410
01:28:03,868 --> 01:28:06,136
Let's hope you're wrong.

1411
01:28:06,237 --> 01:28:08,939
Have a little faith, pal.
Have a little faith.

1412
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,275
I'll meet you there.

1413
01:28:28,826 --> 01:28:31,061
You are a very lucky
young lady.

1414
01:28:31,162 --> 01:28:34,398
I'd say your guardian angel
was working overtime last night.

1415
01:28:34,499 --> 01:28:36,499
So would i!

1416
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:38,869
Yeah, mom.
We're fine.

1417
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:40,870
No, i know,
don't worry.

1418
01:28:42,807 --> 01:28:46,910
And mom, if you're still thinking
about moving to erinville...

1419
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:49,813
it's okay with me.

1420
01:28:57,788 --> 01:29:01,157
Well, then, who might
you be looking for?

1421
01:29:01,259 --> 01:29:03,327
Mr. Conners!

1422
01:29:16,841 --> 01:29:21,277
It gave us the courage to get
out from behind the waterfall.

1423
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:28,718
The courage didn't
come from here.

1424
01:29:28,819 --> 01:29:33,556
It came from what
you believed, in here.

1425
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:36,426
Mr. Conners!

1426
01:29:36,427 --> 01:29:41,598
Oh, Alex! Look, the three
of us, together again.
