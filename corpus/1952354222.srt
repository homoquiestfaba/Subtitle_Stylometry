00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:17,577
CIAO = An Italian Greeting
used either on arrival or departure.

2
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,080
Hello Mark.

3
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:53,223
How are you?

4
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:00,341
I called you yesterday and left you a message.

5
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,079
Did you get it?

6
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:11,962
I want you to know that I will
arrive on the 25th and leave on the 27th.

7
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:21,484
I will try to call you later to
give you knowledge of my itinerary.

8
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:25,978
I am very anxious about this.

9
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:46,294
Dear Andrea.

10
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,963
I am sorry but Mark is no longer among us.

11
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:58,592
He suffered a car accident.

12
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,559
He died last week.

13
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,103
I'm Jeff.

14
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:06,933
It was his friend.

15
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:13,584
I have checked the
your e-mails and answering them.

16
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:19,454
I was not aware
someone would come visit him.

17
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,269
I hope there's still time
to change their travel plans.

18
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,733
I apologize for the inconvenience.

19
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:13,424
Hello Jeff.

20
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:18,777
Hard to believe what happened to Mark.

21
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:24,327
Seems like just yesterday we talked on the phone.

22
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,178
I suppose that Mark not told you
about me but I live in Italy.

23
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:42,109
We met online and went
find us first.

24
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,620
He had planned to go see him after going to
a friend's wedding in New York.

25
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,347
I bought a cheap ticket.

26
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:58,788
I think I will not use anyway.

27
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,275
Sorry, Jeff.

28
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:05,855
I regret it very much.

29
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:16,975
I took a look at your
computer and found e-mails.

30
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:17,725
Eastern them?

31
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:22,329
I know I said I would not move in
his stuff unless he had to do it

32
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,743
So the East, right?

33
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:28,173
Few. Not all, more than a thousand last year.

34
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,852
What is speaking?

35
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,127
Of their lives, what they do, who they are...

36
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:36,365
Were in love?

37
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,105
I do not know.

38
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:41,119
Must be one of these
things that we always hear,

39
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,970
people wanting
find themselves after they met online.

40
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,075
Mark can not imagine doing that.

41
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:48,745
Neither do I!

42
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,140
All I know now there's nothing...

43
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,680
Right.

44
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,139
I do not think it's just sex

45
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,784
I mean, I am sure
which is partly, I'm not naive.

46
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:00,324
But...

47
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,152
It seems they had common interests and opinions.

48
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:09,336
They talked about movies, music,
politics, current events, stuff like that.

49
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:11,949
It's like when I was with him, but...

50
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:12,969
is different.

51
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:13,454
How?

52
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:20,253
It expresses itself in a much more open.

53
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:21,683
What do you mean?

54
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:28,606
Well, sort of, there is an email in which he recounts a
story about his mother when he was in college.

55
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:32,250
She went to get Mark to
airport for the day of Thanksgiving,

56
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,705
he noticed that she had a hole in socks.

57
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:35,385
Right...

58
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:39,423
So... he started crying in the car because...

59
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:47,484
she had spent $ 300 a ticket,
and neglected to buy themselves a pair of socks.

60
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:50,834
He never told this story.

61
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,666
I can not imagine Mark so emotional.

62
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,835
People usually are when you write.

63
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:04,412
Confidential whole series of things
would not do that with people closer.

64
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:07,842
Did you find some pictures of this Adrian?

65
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:09,198
It's Andrea.

66
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,085
Andrea.

67
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,811
Means 'angel' in Italian, right?

68
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,511
Yes .. I think so.

69
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,901
No, I did not find any pictures of him.

70
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:21,633
Surely there is somewhere in
computer, not so earnestly sought.

71
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,631
I was afraid to find out
more, to be honest.

72
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:28,061
Yes, you can find something pretty scary.

73
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,870
I think it should not be so surprised.

74
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,565
I knew he had his flirts.

75
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:37,544
Just did not know that someone so far away.

76
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:39,054
You gonna answer it?

77
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,659
I do not know.

78
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,539
I suppose I should.

79
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:50,505
He must have meant something to Mark.

80
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:56,578
Hello, Jeff!

81
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:58,278
Hello Larry, how are you?

82
00:10:59,429 --> 00:10:59,829
Well

83
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:02,761
How have you been?

84
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,275
I'm fine, thanks.

85
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:05,420
I just came to leave it here.

86
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,671
Are the things that he asked me to bring his house.

87
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,211
Right!

88
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,639
And some checks that arrived by mail.

89
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,799
Yes, thanks.

90
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:14,991
Come in, please.

91
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:24,236
I found this in my armpit, I do not know what it is.
I found it when I was taking a shower.

92
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,598
Let's take a look.

93
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:27,958
Is there somewhere.

94
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:30,218
Yes, I see it.

95
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:31,712
What is it?

96
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:35,996
It's a stain on the skin.
Just need to remove it.

97
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,785
That's it?
Do not need a biopsy?

98
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,075
No. It is benign.

99
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,890
Are you sure?

100
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,035
Absolutely.

101
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,770
It is the only one?

102
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,834
As far as I know.

103
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:51,134
Let's check the other arm just to be sure.

104
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,174
No, everything clean.

105
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,781
Not to worry.

106
00:12:57,781 --> 00:13:00,571
It's just a piece of skin hanging.

107
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:03,866
Could prescribe me also
something to help me sleep?

108
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,526
I took nothing is working.

109
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,713
Ever had trouble sleeping?

110
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,729
Sometimes, not always.

111
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:15,867
Just have been more difficult to sleep lately.

112
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,777
Is under some stress?

113
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,531
I think not.

114
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,450
Smoker?

115
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:24,723
Well, I smoked. I left it for several years.

116
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,676
There are some big changes in your life?

117
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,696
At work?

118
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,422
Well .. I think there...

119
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:33,246
Yes?

120
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,752
Sorry Doctor, Dr. Carlos
called by it, said it is urgent.

121
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,562
Okay.

122
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,911
Sorry Jeff, I gotta go meet.

123
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:43,171
OK

124
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,597
Why do not you lie down a little?

125
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:49,276
I'll be back shortly after take
some things to remove that stain.

126
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:50,296
Absolutely.

127
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,280
Sorry about that, it will be just a minute.

128
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,640
No problem.

129
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:29,615
Hello!

130
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:31,155
I am.

131
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,735
I left some things in your parents house.

132
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,235
Seem far away.

133
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,741
So that's it.

134
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:42,068
Just wanted you to know.

135
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:30,821
Then just send a
mail a copy of death certificate?

136
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:35,522
It's enough to cancel the account?

137
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,121
Okay.

138
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:43,273
I think he had a
form of electronic surveys.

139
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:45,364
Yes.

140
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:47,555
Okay.

141
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:51,645
Can you give me the address?
Wait, let me get a pen.

142
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:02,413
Dear Andrea,
I was thinking about your trip.

143
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:09,860
I would suggest that
keep your plan and come anyway.

144
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:16,765
It's just for a weekend and can stay with me.

145
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:20,264
Do not feel the obligation.

146
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:24,521
You may already have decided it is better not come.

147
00:17:27,502 --> 00:17:34,644
Just know that it is more than welcome.

148
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:47,688
Jeff?

149
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:50,934
Andrea?

150
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,258
Hey, hello, how are you?

151
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,657
I'm fine.
Welcome to Dallas!

152
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:56,416
Thank you.

153
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:57,812
Had to wait long?

154
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:00,690
My flight was delayed.
I called and left a message.

155
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,690
I received. I just arrived in fact.

156
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,288
Do you have any luggage?

157
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,098
Just one.

158
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,743
This is not how I thought it would.

159
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:42,907
What to expect?

160
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:46,068
Cowboys in the desert.

161
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:49,008
Perhaps a century ago.

162
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:52,742
It's definitely very different from New York.

163
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:53,652
By LA

164
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:56,735
Yes, but we need car here as in LA

165
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,415
It's all so far?

166
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:01,026
Not a city for walking.

167
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:04,074
You travel a lot?

168
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,404
Where else was in the U.S.?

169
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,325
San Francisco

170
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:10,305
Philadelphia

171
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:11,809
Chicago,

172
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,667
and Des Moines, Iowa.

173
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,871
What did you do to Des Moines?

174
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:18,426
I had a friend there.

175
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:26,246
Want to borrow?

176
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:26,941
Andrea?

177
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,663
I'll have a''Tendero Ventuccio''.

178
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:33,583
<i>Where are you from?</i>

179
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,283
<i>Italy.</i>

180
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,737
<i>Welcome to Dallas.</i>

181
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:37,820
<i>Is this your first visit?</i>

182
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,440
Yes, it is the first time.

183
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:41,357
<i>How long will it be here?</i>

184
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:42,747
<i>Only a few days.</i>

185
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,461
<i>Enjoy your stay.</i>

186
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:45,274
<i>Thanks!</i>

187
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,134
And you?

188
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:47,739
I want it 32.

189
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,036
<i>Pollo al Miglio?</i>

190
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:49,856
<i>Thank you!</i>

191
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:52,212
You speak Spanish?

192
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,760
I took classes when I was in college.

193
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,333
Furthermore, Spanish is
much like the Italian.

194
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,348
- Oh, right. Both came from Latin.
- Yes.

195
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,936
Your English is quite fluent.

196
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,290
I mean, not that I was not expecting that.

197
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:09,712
Well, my mother was an English teacher,
then think I do better than most Italians.

198
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:11,841
Doest work for the Web, right?

199
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,051
How do you know?

200
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,755
Your e-mail to Mark.

201
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:17,915
I read some of them.

202
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,287
I have not read everything, e. ..

203
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,259
Look at Andrea, I do not want
think that was spying on...

204
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,709
No problem, right?

205
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:27,127
Were curious
did not know anything about me.

206
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:27,937
So...

207
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,878
Yes I am a graphic designer,

208
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:33,091
freelancer, self-employment,

209
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,091
I especially websites.

210
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,019
What do you do?

211
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,477
I am a financial planner.
Working in a bank here.

212
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,486
How was New York?
There was a wedding, right?

213
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,756
Yes My friend Vince married.

214
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,505
Go to school together, in Genoa.

215
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,808
Then she volunteered to
a school of UNESCO in India...

216
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:49,208
Cool!

217
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:51,664
He met an American girl...

218
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,824
They had a very good reception.

219
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:57,477
Find there his family
Italy was a bit surreal...

220
00:20:57,477 --> 00:20:58,180
What do you mean?

221
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,990
Ah! Because you're used to seeing them
in Italy and met with them e. ..

222
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,525
Yes .. are people who see
usually at home and see them there seemed...

223
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:05,395
Makes sense.

224
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,555
Your family is here in Dallas?

225
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,456
Only Lauren, my half-sister.

226
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:12,175
My mother lives in Houston with my stepfather.

227
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:14,244
My real father lives
in St. Louis with his family.

228
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:14,704
Right.

229
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:16,357
Where are you from originally?

230
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:16,757
Waco.

231
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:18,316
Waco...

232
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:21,116
David Garresh?

233
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:23,554
Our ticket to fame!

234
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:25,245
But remember Jennifer Love Hewitt.

235
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:26,508
She is also from Waco?

236
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:27,548
She was born there.

237
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:29,592
Not far from here, right?

238
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,361
No, about two hours to drive.

239
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,908
So too are a Texan?

240
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:33,488
<i>Yup!</i>

241
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,201
But not detect an accent.

242
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:40,140
'Slipped' from time to time in
some words, like, still say "Y'all."

243
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,350
What is "You all".

244
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:42,962
How is it used?

245
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:45,322
Y'all never heard''''?

246
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,943
Say for example, I
I say "Have a nice day!"

247
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:54,573
If someone else is with you and I
I'm talking about, or a group of people.

248
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:55,093
Type...

249
00:21:55,955 --> 00:21:56,705
<i>Yo all?</i>

250
00:21:56,792 --> 00:22:00,098
As if it were a single word, "Y'all."
It has to be softer.

251
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:00,738
<i>Youall</i>

252
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,897
Now it further.

253
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,980
"Y'all"
As if you had to scroll a bit of tongue.

254
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:07,911
<i>Y'all?</i>

255
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:12,093
Quite close.
Could also be a Texan, you know?

256
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:13,603
Mark had an accent.

257
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:15,417
I thought it was quite charming.

258
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,752
He was a smaller town.

259
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,392
Longview.

260
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,196
Longview, Texas.

261
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:23,037
I knew he wanted me
learn to dance "country"?

262
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:23,422
Really?

263
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:23,762
Yes.

264
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:28,187
He sent me a DVD.
One of those instructional videos,

265
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:33,530
but it was hard for me to learn. Then said
Mark to teach me that when he came to Dallas.

266
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,410
Also dances "country"?

267
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,596
No! I'm pretty bad at any kind of dance.

268
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:38,982
But Mark was dancing every week.

269
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,427
There's a bar here "Country
Western "that he attended.

270
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,074
It's funny to imagine me just to do that, you know?

271
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:45,241
What? Country dance?

272
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:48,841
Yes! Use the cowboy hat, jeans and boots.

273
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:51,199
Can you imagine me like that? I'm Italian...

274
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:54,379
Mark had a way of convincing
people to do things they normally would not do.

275
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:58,979
Never told him how much I
I hated country music, for that matter.

276
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,133
I also am no fan...

277
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:04,520
He was always making me CDs
corpora, trying to convert me...

278
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,542
but I could not like it.

279
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,664
He sent me some CDs too...

280
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:12,154
but... not even had the courage
to tell him what I thought of them.

281
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,675
I found them interesting, however,

282
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:15,425
letters,

283
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,753
they do not... "Turns to the subject give" you know?

284
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,217
- You mean "they turn to the subject."
- Give back to the subject, right.

285
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,120
The lyrics revolve the issue.

286
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,896
I love you, miss you,
I'm so alone. It is very practical front.

287
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,651
If you need a blanket, is in a closet.

288
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,760
But now it is quite hot,
so probably you will not need.

289
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,040
OK.

290
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:44,246
The bathroom is down the hall.
Leave some towels there for you.

291
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:44,646
Cool!

292
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:45,544
<i>Grazie!</i>

293
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:46,866
Excuse me?

294
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:48,063
It means thank you.

295
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:49,503
Oh, right!
You're welcome.

296
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,373
This is your room?

297
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,240
Where you gonna sleep then?

298
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,574
I have a sofa bed in the room.

299
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:59,298
- I can sleep there. Stay with your room
- No, no! Okay, I do not care.

300
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:00,011
Are you sure?

301
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:04,383
Yes It's quite comfortable, in fact, is more comfortable
that my bed. So you'll be doing me a favor.

302
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:05,313
Ok, thanks.

303
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,738
Mark painted this?

304
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,390
As guessed?

305
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:15,205
He sent me to a few months. It...

306
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:19,178
is smaller, but has
more or less the same style.

307
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:20,618
You know what this is?

308
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:23,410
No, he did not like to explain to their works.

309
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,293
He was very defensive about it.

310
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:26,353
It's funny...

311
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:27,973
With Yes mine too.

312
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:29,923
Nor do I mean.

313
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,161
This can be...

314
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:33,845
an animal.

315
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,443
Like an elephant.

316
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:40,674
I do not know if it is to be something.

317
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,429
Actually it's a bit ugly.

318
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,109
A little? It's very ugly!

319
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:49,737
He loved to paint.
I guess he did not pay it.

320
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:52,983
Of course I never told you.
In fact, even encouraged him.

321
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:55,118
So, this is partially my fault.

322
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:59,687
Well, I told him I loved him
sent me. So the blame is also mine.

323
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:03,647
You did the right thing.
He did not accept the criticism well.

324
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:06,816
I've been meaning to ask you.

325
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,040
Got something you want to do,
while you are here?

326
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,550
Something you want to see?

327
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:13,184
We can go see Mark?

328
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:17,104
Sure.

329
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:18,503
Is it far?

330
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:20,332
Not much.

331
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:22,590
It is located in the northern part of town.

332
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,270
If you do not mind to take me there...

333
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:29,148
We can do it tomorrow.
I'll let you install it.

334
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,969
I have something for you.

335
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:35,846
What is it?

336
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:37,207
<i>Pesto.</i>

337
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,513
Made by my mother.

338
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:39,903
Cool! Must be nice.

339
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:43,378
It is best, but... I am biased.

340
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:44,597
Thank you.

341
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:47,434
It's just a small reminder. You're welcome.

342
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,954
Did not need, but really liked.

343
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,742
Let's get some sleep.
Tell me if you need something.

344
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:53,672
Ok Thanks.

345
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,071
Hello mother.

346
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:59,155
Hello? Hello?

347
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:01,749
Mother, do you hear me? I am.

348
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:05,982
Hello Andrea! Can you speak louder? I hear ya too low.

349
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,875
Better now?

350
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,035
Yes, how are you?

351
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,095
I'm fine.

352
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:15,500
And you how are you? I wake you?

353
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,568
No. You know I wake up early.

354
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,139
It's all right there?

355
00:26:19,402 --> 00:26:20,354
Yes, yes, everything is fine.

356
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:24,038
Where are you now? Also in New York?

357
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:26,670
No, I came to Dallas today.

358
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:29,632
Ah yes, you had to find yourself with a friend there.

359
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,536
Yes.

360
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,679
How is he?

361
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:35,946
Okay. I'm at his house now.

362
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,418
Have you eaten? What time is it there?

363
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:41,400
No mom, I'm dying of hunger.

364
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:44,033
Of course I've ever had! It's almost midnight here.

365
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,849
How is he? It is nice?

366
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:47,915
Yes, it's nice.

367
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,075
It is very polite.

368
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,627
Even gave me a bottle of "pesto" of the mother.

369
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:55,213
It's really sweet!
They did something after the pick up?

370
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,783
Yes I took him to dinner.

371
00:26:57,027 --> 00:27:00,124
You've discovered something else about him and Mark?

372
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:01,514
No, absolutely not.

373
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,056
I'm still getting to know him.

374
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,626
Furthermore, it is private.

375
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,329
He tells me what I want to tell.

376
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,661
You should meet him.

377
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,121
You think?

378
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:13,507
Yes, I leave you to do the questioning.

379
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:38,432
Are you superstitious?

380
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:40,947
Not at all.

381
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,850
You are?

382
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:48,743
My cat Caesar, had one of his Whiskers
behind the monitor of my computer last year.

383
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:53,867
At the time I had a lot of work.
Then I cleaned my room and threw out the Whiskers.

384
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:54,746
Guess what happened?

385
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:55,256
What?

386
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,676
The work stopped.
Nothing came up for weeks.

387
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,926
So, I put another whiskers on the same site.

388
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:03,408
Yes, he was not pleased.

389
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,652
I gave a slap on the monitor, and
work back again. So.

390
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:08,286
That's funny.

391
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:11,913
Yes I think I'll spread
more, putting the whole house.

392
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:12,723
You stay rich.

393
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,930
I hope so.

394
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:18,043
Tell me more about where you live.

395
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,811
Have you ever been in Italy?

396
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:25,700
Well .. Genoa is not like Rome
or Florence, if you know what they look like.

397
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,259
I have an idea in general.

398
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:30,793
Genoa is not as good as those places listed.

399
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:35,552
It has a huge historical center,
but is also a post-industrial city.

400
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:41,239
So you can find architecture
century. XIV alongside the 60 industries.

401
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:44,534
- It is by the sea, is not it?
- Yes, It has a seaport.

402
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:47,409
Right. I'm wondering
the map of the lessons of history.

403
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:48,897
Where Christopher Columbus was born, right?

404
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:49,357
Exactly.

405
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:53,962
Usually I describe it to people
San Francisco as a medieval and decadent,

406
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:56,418
because it extends the
hills, like San Francisco.

407
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:57,518
So pretty.

408
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:58,707
Some parts.

409
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,518
Especially the mountains.

410
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:04,508
We also have numerous
old buildings, churches, museums...

411
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,696
Mar and I talked about taking a
months and travel around Europe.

412
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:08,266
Really?

413
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,634
Yes, but we could not
find the time to do so.

414
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:14,599
You know, one of those things
we always say, that sounds like a good idea...

415
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,919
Mark said he wanted me to go visit Italy.

416
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:20,446
But I came here first.

417
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:24,531
I just... my timing was not correct.

418
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:31,291
You learned something from Danny?

419
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,992
He moved to Seattle after separating.

420
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:36,771
I called her to tell you about Mark.

421
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:39,530
I thought it would come to the funeral, but did not appear.

422
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,558
They have been together for so long, right?

423
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:43,008
About five years.

424
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:46,979
I wonder if he told you this, but...

425
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,367
things had become even ugly at the end.

426
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:53,696
Mark just said
things had not worked among them.

427
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,386
I did not ask why.

428
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,911
Danny began using drugs.

429
00:30:57,911 --> 00:30:58,371
Really?

430
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:00,178
What kind of drugs?

431
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,103
Methadone, mainly.

432
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:06,431
Began to engage in big fights.

433
00:31:06,435 --> 00:31:09,031
Once Mark came to me
door with a bruise on his face.

434
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:10,150
Danny hit him?

435
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,950
No, they beat each other.

436
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:17,372
There was a time when Danny
was involved in something almost every night.

437
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:20,572
Mark did not like to talk about it.

438
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:24,749
I never made it with Danny.

439
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,269
Why?

440
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:30,801
He did not like me to spend time with Mark.

441
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,928
I thought we were...

442
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:33,350
intimate.

443
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,640
You mean sexually intimate?

444
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:36,428
Yes.

445
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:38,138
And were they?

446
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:39,433
No.

447
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:45,086
Well, I mean, there was a time, but...
not even aware we were drunk.

448
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:46,246
What happened?

449
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,326
Somehow we got in my bed.

450
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,290
I knew I would not do anything,
dresses were all the time.

451
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:58,573
But at some moment of the night we kissed e. ..

452
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:01,997
Anyway, when I woke up he had already left.

453
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:04,687
So, never talked about it later?

454
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:07,974
No, it's one of those things not mentioned.

455
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:09,084
It's embarrassing.

456
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:13,988
It is strange that you and Mark were not together.

457
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:14,508
Why?

458
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:19,827
I do not know. Looks like you two were
made for each other. Were close.

459
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:21,113
Are you forgetting one thing.

460
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:21,623
What?

461
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:22,452
Type.

462
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:24,634
Age was not his.

463
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:27,122
What you think is his type?

464
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:27,839
I do not know.

465
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:30,944
Someone with the most exotic.

466
00:32:30,944 --> 00:32:33,124
Preferably a foreigner.

467
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,625
Maybe an Italian.

468
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:19,348
That's him.

469
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:22,222
Yes, when he was born.

470
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:26,074
Took a photo of himself every year.

471
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:30,945
He played football?

472
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:34,869
It was very good at it indeed.
He played up to university.

473
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,489
It was his dog, Sammy.

474
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:38,637
He died last year.

475
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,754
What happened that?

476
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:42,007
Did you know that he played rugby, right?

477
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:42,347
Yes.

478
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:47,652
Playing in a tournament
London, broke his arm in the games.

479
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,302
You were friends in college, right?

480
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:49,642
Yes.

481
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,774
How did you meet him?

482
00:34:51,783 --> 00:34:53,431
We were in the same dorm.

483
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:55,291
He was two doors from him.

484
00:34:55,834 --> 00:35:00,104
He did not speak to me until we
fallen into the same class a semester.

485
00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:02,664
We copy each other until graduation.

486
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:06,728
We changed our campus and become roommates.

487
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:09,508
What will happen to his house?

488
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:12,559
His parents will put it up for sale soon.

489
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,597
I'll have to help them
pack everything when sold.

490
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:18,664
I think it would not be able to do it alone.

491
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:20,064
It would be very difficult.

492
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:23,033
It's very nice of you.

493
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:26,246
He would have done the same for me.

494
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:01,204
I saw this room before.

495
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,103
He sent me pictures.

496
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:07,407
Feels like I knew him well.

497
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:17,544
I wonder why he
I never said anything about you.

498
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,699
Thought that you would judge.

499
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:21,736
Why do it?

500
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:27,808
He told me that once you told him
it just felt drawn to losers.

501
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:33,594
Imagine what would you say if I told you that
had a known type online, and from another country.

502
00:37:33,594 --> 00:37:34,934
What he said is partly true,

503
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:39,304
I mean, before Danny
was Edward, after the François...

504
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:44,253
None of them paid, one way or another.

505
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:47,402
He also said that he needed therapy,

506
00:37:47,402 --> 00:37:50,218
before you start out with someone again.

507
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:52,018
Yes, I said even that.

508
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,738
I even offered to pay him the first session.

509
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,478
I think he did not want
think I was a freak,

510
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:05,988
before I know.

511
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:09,463
But...

512
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,997
He wanted us knew, you know?

513
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:14,406
Well, here I am.

514
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,290
Do not know if this is it.

515
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,680
Are you sure it still works?

516
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,338
There must be...

517
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,070
switch on the back.

518
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
He bought it online.

519
00:38:57,648 --> 00:39:00,743
I would try to give him a beating when you come here.

520
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:02,432
Never played in this before?

521
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:05,162
Yes, when I was there for about 16 years.

522
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:07,924
Come, let us fight each other.

523
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:09,783
No, I'm just watching.

524
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,266
I need to jump! I need...

525
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,306
You just have to...

526
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:15,795
Mine is damaged, is defective!

527
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:17,405
No it is not broken yet.

528
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,837
- You have to try better.
- Okay, wait, wait.

529
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:20,817
Do not hit me.

530
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:22,972
Not so.

531
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:25,517
You can not beat me while I'm trying...

532
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:26,555
I'm trying to figure out how to do this move.

533
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:28,112
I am trying to explain it.

534
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:29,217
How did you do that?

535
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:32,706
How did you do a
fireball out of nothing?

536
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:33,990
You can not make fireballs.

537
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,380
It's my character.

538
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:39,294
And what mine does? All he does is hit.

539
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,504
You have to do a combo. So.

540
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:42,729
A combo?

541
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,482
Yes, a combo, carries on first and second button.

542
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,903
First and second button.

543
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:49,593
Cool! Rain! It's cool!

544
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,003
What is the fucking rain?

545
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:56,913
I do not know, but took half of your energy.

546
00:39:57,246 --> 00:39:58,464
You see this?

547
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,674
It's the clutch, tighten and cute.

548
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,882
One neutral, two and three.

549
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:09,492
Think you can?

550
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,822
I think we'll have to find out.

551
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:24,988
Calm down! Calm down!

552
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:42,934
How old were you here?

553
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:44,454
An eight.

554
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:46,916
It's your family?

555
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,094
You look like you more...

556
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:51,957
with your mother.

557
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,010
It's what people say.

558
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,372
Who is the girl?

559
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:00,833
It is Lauren, my half sister.

560
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,933
She is Asian?

561
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:02,646
Chinese.

562
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:05,602
Then your stepfather is Chinese?

563
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:08,652
There is a picture of him somewhere out there.

564
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:09,732
Here you are.

565
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:14,302
How they met, he and your mother?

566
00:41:14,302 --> 00:41:16,052
Belong to the same church.

567
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,243
Have been married for about 10 years.

568
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:24,406
Salta this page, please.

569
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:26,181
This really you?

570
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:29,154
Yes, at the time was
fat and I hated myself.

571
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,553
And dye your hair?

572
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:34,303
It was to be
blond surfer, but was orange-punk.

573
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,419
When do you take?

574
00:41:36,634 --> 00:41:38,121
In college last year.

575
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,271
Then Mark was around.

576
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,107
He took one week before me.

577
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:42,917
A week?

578
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:44,206
Why a week?

579
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:47,773
One day he asked me to
meet with him in the library.

580
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:51,623
It was a place that was
truly isolated and private.

581
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:54,299
It was me and three girls.

582
00:41:54,418 --> 00:41:57,590
We were there trying to imagine what was going on.

583
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,150
Then he came up with this, from nothing.

584
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:01,154
Unexpected.

585
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:06,292
And this before we have any
type of support groups on campus.

586
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:10,399
I was stunned, but all
others were happy and supported.

587
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:15,986
I guess I should have said something like
"This is it!" Or something stupid like.

588
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:19,955
I called him a week later
and told him it was too, but...

589
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,944
was not even angry
I have taken a week earlier.

590
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:24,104
It was too late.

591
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:28,665
Yes He expected me
assume the same time as him.

592
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:30,754
I had a friend in high school.

593
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,923
He sat near me in class.

594
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:37,971
We were somewhat close, but
I was in love with him.

595
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,062
Tortured me with stories about
of girls who had sexual relations.

596
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:43,582
Typical.

597
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,040
I saw it again recently,
to say about a month, on the market.

598
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,417
Held at least fifteen
years since the last time I saw him.

599
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,457
It's a long time.

600
00:42:54,617 --> 00:42:56,657
You are married. Three children.

601
00:42:56,772 --> 00:42:59,402
A true family man, you know?

602
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:01,833
It was quite excited to see me,

603
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:03,496
asked me my phone number.

604
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:07,326
He told me:
"We have to go have a drink together one day."

605
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:09,502
But I do not know if I want to see again.

606
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:10,312
Why not?

607
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:12,157
Well, would ask questions about me.

608
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,197
If married,

609
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,804
-... to have a girlfriend...
- Oh, right!

610
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:17,614
Then you'd have to say:

611
00:43:17,616 --> 00:43:22,091
"Yes, I used to masturbate me
Thinking of you fucking your girlfriend. "

612
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:24,161
Yes, probably would not accept it very well.

613
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:24,971
Absolutely nothing.

614
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:27,685
The funny thing is...

615
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,561
still dream about him every once in a while.

616
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:34,801
Like, once a year
dream to be in high school with Gian Lucca.

617
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,049
I've been having dreams about Mark.

618
00:43:41,512 --> 00:43:43,590
It's like we're back to college,

619
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,960
like, to walk together, do whatever...

620
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:49,845
Until I can smell your deodorant.

621
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:55,943
See that red sweater
he would always use. It's hateful.

622
00:43:59,526 --> 00:44:00,396
And you...

623
00:44:01,466 --> 00:44:03,916
I felt him sitting beside me.

624
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:09,334
It's all so vivid and real, you know?

625
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:15,473
And then I wake...

626
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:27,911
''This pesto is great!

627
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:30,586
Your mother must be a good cook.

628
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:34,016
Yeah, but when you're in a bad mood, just leave shit...

629
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:38,357
Here, put some of this on your chicken.

630
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,718
What is it?

631
00:44:45,718 --> 00:44:49,168
Peach juice, mixed with yogurt and mustard.

632
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:50,663
Own income?

633
00:44:51,618 --> 00:44:54,368
It was an accidental discovery in a buffet.

634
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:58,394
My sister and I challenged ourselves
to prove everything misturássemos.

635
00:44:58,394 --> 00:45:01,698
Then she made a
stew with jelly beans.

636
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,798
And it was terrible!

637
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:07,108
So, I made a sauce with juice
orange, mustard and vanilla ice cream.

638
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:09,529
Actually was not too bad, but I thought:

639
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:13,416
"This is better able to know if I replace
by the orange and peach ice cream for yogurt. "

640
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:16,103
Then added a
pinch of essence to balance.

641
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:16,743
<i>Voila!</i>

642
00:45:18,472 --> 00:45:20,922
I liked the potato curry too.

643
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:23,104
Usually do not like, but...

644
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,410
this is a...

645
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:25,986
unique taste.

646
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:27,505
Not too spicy.

647
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:30,070
It is the Chardonnay. Works wonders with curry.

648
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,460
You should be a chef.

649
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,942
It has long passed the age of a career change.

650
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:36,452
It is never too late.

651
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,940
In the end, better late than never.

652
00:45:44,605 --> 00:45:45,235
By Mark.

653
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:50,482
By Mark.

654
00:45:57,158 --> 00:45:59,768
Who is your best friend in Italy?

655
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:02,254
Have to be Diego.

656
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:03,722
How is he?

657
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,630
It's my age,

658
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:07,829
slightly higher,

659
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:09,519
naturally tanned skin.

660
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:10,776
How old are you, anyway?

661
00:46:10,776 --> 00:46:12,396
Thirty-four, and you?

662
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:13,848
Twenty-nine.

663
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:14,645
Really?

664
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:16,817
In what year were you born?

665
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:17,217
1978.

666
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:20,084
Should not it be 1977?

667
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:23,311
I did not want
wert my financial planner.

668
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:24,610
Okay, you got me.

669
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,491
I have the same age as Mark.

670
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:28,775
Anyway,
I interrupted you when you were speaking of Diego.

671
00:46:28,775 --> 00:46:30,187
Where was I?

672
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,770
Slightly higher with
naturally tanned skin...

673
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:33,230
Yes ..

674
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,658
He has a very exotic.

675
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:37,758
It is half Lebanese.

676
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:39,333
Looks hot...

677
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:39,903
Yes it is.

678
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:45,706
You are intimate with Diego?

679
00:46:47,008 --> 00:46:47,348
No.

680
00:46:48,877 --> 00:46:52,572
Not one incident
alcoholic who ended up in bed anyone?

681
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:56,518
We met through my
ex-girlfriend, and they are together now, so...

682
00:46:56,518 --> 00:46:57,261
Did you have a girlfriend?

683
00:46:57,261 --> 00:46:57,601
Yes.

684
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:00,044
For how long?

685
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:00,794
Six years.

686
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:02,199
Really?!

687
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,759
She is one of those
people who like to be.

688
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:08,099
We get on very well.

689
00:47:09,574 --> 00:47:11,144
So what happened?

690
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,720
Lha discovered that lacked a dick.

691
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:18,689
We know each other since high school.

692
00:47:19,061 --> 00:47:21,627
Did not come out until I was twenty or so.

693
00:47:21,627 --> 00:47:23,298
But... she always knew.

694
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,769
Like Mark knew about you in college.

695
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:28,099
He was already married.

696
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:28,674
Really?

697
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,015
Well, it was a deal.

698
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:32,869
What do you mean?

699
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:36,107
Well, he had a friend working in Venezuela,

700
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:38,137
and she wanted to stay here.

701
00:47:38,866 --> 00:47:41,250
Then combined to
she obtained a Green Card.

702
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,098
She paid him to do that?

703
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:44,448
No, he did so as a favor.

704
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:49,568
Mark was like, did not
matter what the people he liked.

705
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:55,282
I wanted to ask you...

706
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:58,970
What?

707
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:02,465
The accident.

708
00:48:04,684 --> 00:48:06,194
How did that happen?

709
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:10,803
He went his way to work.

710
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:14,171
A truck moved into his lane.

711
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:18,858
Then he changed to a
faster track to avoid it.

712
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:21,385
Was hit from behind by
a truck at high speed.

713
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:22,545
The car flipped.

714
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:26,107
What happened to the other driver?

715
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:28,524
Was injured but not critically.

716
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,206
When you find?

717
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,068
His father called me.

718
00:48:33,925 --> 00:48:37,005
I was in Houston to visit my mother.

719
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,385
I returned by plane and went straight to hospital.

720
00:48:40,468 --> 00:48:41,398
He was...

721
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:45,344
He was in a coma with massive brain damage.

722
00:48:45,594 --> 00:48:47,224
He died the next day.

723
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:51,258
One nurse said...

724
00:48:51,258 --> 00:48:54,648
that when they took him he was still conscious.

725
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,259
Just wanted to have been there, you know?

726
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,348
Have you ever heard say,

727
00:49:07,348 --> 00:49:08,748
when someone dies,

728
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:10,171
usually receives a signal before?

729
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:11,981
Even when it is unexpected.

730
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:12,656
Yes.

731
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:16,658
When my grandmother died,

732
00:49:17,427 --> 00:49:19,587
the day before the death,

733
00:49:20,153 --> 00:49:25,563
she spoke with someone in the room,
how to take... how to have a real conversation,

734
00:49:26,115 --> 00:49:27,915
but there was nobody there.

735
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:31,895
Mark was very
right things about the laundry.

736
00:49:31,895 --> 00:49:34,235
Never let dirty clothes accumulate.

737
00:49:34,497 --> 00:49:35,867
Was one of his foibles.

738
00:49:35,867 --> 00:49:36,327
But...

739
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:42,613
been there a week before he died and
the basket of dirty laundry was overflowing.

740
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:44,773
Never seen that before.

741
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:49,079
Perhaps the track that...

742
00:49:49,413 --> 00:49:51,913
never had to wash clothes.

743
00:50:03,952 --> 00:50:06,912
What was the last thing he told you?

744
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:12,258
Goodbye... Until later.

745
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:13,698
No. I mean...

746
00:50:14,038 --> 00:50:15,378
before the dismissal.

747
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:18,403
Remember what he said?

748
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:25,039
No, I do not know... Never thought about it.

749
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:29,055
What was the last thing he told you?

750
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,529
We talked on the phone,

751
00:50:33,749 --> 00:50:35,669
few days before the accident.

752
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:38,044
And he said...

753
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:41,679
What did he say?

754
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,500
It's a bit cheesy.

755
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:47,456
Promise you will not laugh.

756
00:50:51,112 --> 00:50:52,045
You promised.

757
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:52,975
Yes! I promised!

758
00:50:57,616 --> 00:50:58,366
He said:

759
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,040
Can not wait to have you in my arms.

760
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:15,711
Excuse me.

761
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,648
Come in, we're having dinner.

762
00:51:32,782 --> 00:51:33,762
You okay?

763
00:51:34,378 --> 00:51:35,188
Yes, yes...

764
00:51:36,246 --> 00:51:38,395
Would I come back later?

765
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,435
Not so good.

766
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:54,425
Andrea, this is Lauren.

767
00:51:57,116 --> 00:52:00,155
- Hello! Jeff talked a lot to you.
- From you, too. How are you?

768
00:52:00,155 --> 00:52:01,075
Well, how about you?

769
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:03,632
I'm fine. I'm fine.

770
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:06,934
Jeff, you... ahmmm...

771
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:09,427
fix the vacuum?

772
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,003
What?

773
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:14,519
Would ask for your loan.
Remember? My broke down.

774
00:52:15,353 --> 00:52:15,813
Right!

775
00:52:16,684 --> 00:52:17,844
It's in the closet.

776
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:18,758
I'll get.

777
00:52:19,448 --> 00:52:20,484
Want something to eat?

778
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:24,014
- No. I ate.
- Then sit down and drink a cup.

779
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,171
<i>Damm il soldi!</i>

780
00:52:25,171 --> 00:52:26,221
I want butter.

781
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:27,634
No! Give me your purse.

782
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:28,658
<i>Damm il soldi!</i>

783
00:52:28,658 --> 00:52:29,708
Give me money.

784
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,199
Right!

785
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:30,899
<i>Giusto!</i>

786
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:33,245
Very good. Here's mine.

787
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,760
<i>Wo ai ni</i>

788
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:37,132
<i>Wo ai ni!</i>

789
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,340
Am I happy? I'm very happy?

790
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:40,444
<i>Wo ai ni!</i>

791
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,220
I like you?

792
00:52:42,672 --> 00:52:45,558
- Wo ai. Wo ai ni.
- Ti voglio bene. I love thee?

793
00:52:45,558 --> 00:52:46,128
That's it!

794
00:52:46,805 --> 00:52:48,238
What did you say?

795
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:49,518
<i>Ti voglio bene.</i>

796
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,353
- Di Vuli bene.
- No.

797
00:52:51,353 --> 00:52:53,971
<i>- Ti voglio bene
- Ti Volha bene.</i>

798
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:55,361
With a G, 'voglio'.

799
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:56,382
<i>Voglio.</i>

800
00:52:57,276 --> 00:52:58,443
<i>Ti voglio bene.</i>

801
00:52:58,443 --> 00:52:58,903
Right!

802
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:01,068
You can say its over?

803
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:01,988
<i>Wo ai ni.</i>

804
00:53:03,773 --> 00:53:04,353
<i>Wo...</i>

805
00:53:04,443 --> 00:53:05,769
<i>-... alas
- Ai...</i>

806
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,269
<i>-... ni
- Ni...</i>

807
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:08,755
<i>Wo ai ni.</i>

808
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:09,395
Perfect!

809
00:53:09,825 --> 00:53:11,145
It's your time Jeff.

810
00:53:11,847 --> 00:53:13,410
I do not know any foreign language.

811
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,990
Get anything.

812
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:16,297
How?

813
00:53:17,313 --> 00:53:20,533
Say something, something not understand.

814
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,020
Ok Here's one.

815
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:28,955
Is so dry that the trees are bribing the dogs.

816
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,430
Oh, God! Not one of these!

817
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,593
What is it? Texan?

818
00:53:31,593 --> 00:53:32,293
Texfónico.

819
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,979
Texfónico? You mean like Cubone?

820
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,674
So, you know what that means?

821
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,631
I have no idea.

822
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:41,671
Means that it will not rain.

823
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:43,249
That does not make any fucking sense.

824
00:53:43,249 --> 00:53:45,629
Okay, let's easier.

825
00:53:46,986 --> 00:53:49,256
This applies to you, actually.

826
00:53:49,302 --> 00:53:51,102
"Gird thee to thy ball."

827
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:52,257
What?

828
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:56,611
What does it mean when I say that
you should confine yourself to your own ball?

829
00:53:56,611 --> 00:53:58,471
Type: Put yourself in your life?

830
00:53:58,601 --> 00:53:59,421
Exactly!

831
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:00,916
Right...

832
00:54:01,883 --> 00:54:04,092
So what do you think Dallas so far?

833
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:04,902
It looks good.

834
00:54:05,314 --> 00:54:07,548
Actually I did not see much,

835
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:08,948
but it looks cool.

836
00:54:09,218 --> 00:54:14,043
Honestly, coming from Italy, only
that the site be cleaned up makes it beautiful.

837
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,998
Do not show you the city, Jeff?

838
00:54:15,998 --> 00:54:17,721
We went to the house of Mark today.

839
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:21,518
You should take him for a ride,
you know, do some sightseeing.

840
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:22,778
He leaves tomorrow morning.

841
00:54:22,778 --> 00:54:23,528
So soon?

842
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:24,022
Yes.

843
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,700
This is even a short visit.

844
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:29,554
That's what Mark and I agreed.

845
00:54:29,554 --> 00:54:30,884
What was the deal?

846
00:54:31,766 --> 00:54:35,285
That would be two days
sufficient for a first date.

847
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:39,256
If we do not we give and we would not be
forced to stay together for long.

848
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:39,716
Right.

849
00:54:40,422 --> 00:54:43,212
And they got along well? Would be longer?

850
00:54:44,232 --> 00:54:44,752
Maybe!

851
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:49,699
He said he wanted to go
Italy to visit me if everything went well.

852
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:51,801
I've done it before.

853
00:54:52,262 --> 00:54:52,892
Once.

854
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:56,339
Remember Des Moines?

855
00:54:56,602 --> 00:54:57,622
Des Moines, Iowa?

856
00:54:57,622 --> 00:54:57,962
Yes.

857
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,850
I had a friend there.

858
00:55:03,323 --> 00:55:05,113
I went to see a kind.

859
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,064
He was someone you met online too?

860
00:55:07,064 --> 00:55:07,404
Yes.

861
00:55:08,017 --> 00:55:10,072
I should spend a week there.

862
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:10,712
Damn!

863
00:55:11,118 --> 00:55:12,607
This is a bit embarrassing.

864
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:13,067
Account!

865
00:55:14,452 --> 00:55:17,810
Well, he had not told me that
was bipolar [manic depressive]

866
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,210
demo us well but...

867
00:55:20,613 --> 00:55:22,272
But he stopped taking the medication,

868
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:25,577
so it was acting in a
very erratic while I was there.

869
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:29,193
On the third day
started yelling at me for no reason.

870
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:33,202
So I was really scared, and
grabbed me and went to a hotel.

871
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:35,451
There is no one in Italy to date?

872
00:55:35,451 --> 00:55:37,057
People who live in 'Geneva'?

873
00:55:37,057 --> 00:55:38,006
It's 'Genoa' darling.

874
00:55:38,006 --> 00:55:39,176
Sorry, Genoa.

875
00:55:39,183 --> 00:55:39,703
Genoa!

876
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:44,467
There is much to see here.
It is not like Rome, you know?

877
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,857
It is not easy to meet other types.

878
00:55:47,403 --> 00:55:50,578
So my social network is a bit limited

879
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:52,621
and I end up meeting people online.

880
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:54,901
Why do not Americans and Europeans?

881
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,438
Because I have a fetish for Yankees

882
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:58,818
Really?
Is that why?

883
00:55:59,157 --> 00:55:59,497
No!

884
00:56:00,622 --> 00:56:01,482
Not so.

885
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:03,039
Just...

886
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:06,313
Sometimes talking to someone,

887
00:56:06,313 --> 00:56:06,893
online

888
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:10,712
start talking, it establishes a
link, and the person happens to be in...

889
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:11,922
Des Moines, Iowa.

890
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:12,117
Yes.

891
00:56:12,117 --> 00:56:13,081
Or Dallas, Texas.

892
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:13,901
Exactly!

893
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,039
It's not as if there was a geographical planning,

894
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,895
as if I had to learn a kind of state.

895
00:56:17,895 --> 00:56:18,645
Minimal.

896
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,361
I know it sounds crazy,

897
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:24,688
make this journey every,
thus far, to know a person,

898
00:56:24,688 --> 00:56:25,949
but every once in a while

899
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,989
you talk with someone special.

900
00:56:28,171 --> 00:56:29,441
And try your luck!

901
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:31,548
It was a pleasure to meet you Andrea!

902
00:56:31,548 --> 00:56:33,610
It was a pleasure to meet you too.

903
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,613
Jeff, can you help me with the vacuum?

904
00:56:35,613 --> 00:56:36,073
Sure.

905
00:56:36,537 --> 00:56:38,405
Lets stay on the table. I already handle it.

906
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:40,261
Okay, I can handle this.

907
00:56:40,261 --> 00:56:41,191
Ok, thanks.

908
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,853
The vacuum, Lauren?

909
00:56:45,853 --> 00:56:47,997
I had to make an excuse,

910
00:56:47,997 --> 00:56:49,718
otherwise would be too obvious.

911
00:56:49,718 --> 00:56:51,418
Right! Very convincing.

912
00:56:52,482 --> 00:56:55,163
When will I get this back?

913
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:57,703
Let him in my car, give you back tomorrow.

914
00:56:57,703 --> 00:56:59,924
The trunk is full. Will not fit here.

915
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:02,494
I have some space in the backseat.

916
00:57:08,606 --> 00:57:10,613
You even by squeezing the details.

917
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:14,216
He was more than happy
to tell anyway.

918
00:57:14,216 --> 00:57:15,676
I think he likes you, the purpose.

919
00:57:15,676 --> 00:57:17,235
What makes you say that?

920
00:57:17,235 --> 00:57:18,465
Female intuition.

921
00:57:19,276 --> 00:57:21,621
You know, you should confine yourself to your own ball.

922
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:24,184
As if thou hadst not thought of that!

923
00:57:24,184 --> 00:57:25,254
Good evening, Lauren!

924
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:26,004
Good night!

925
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:35,628
Gone?

926
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:38,127
No, it happens once in a while.

927
00:57:38,795 --> 00:57:39,315
Pronto!

928
00:57:41,175 --> 00:57:42,427
Thanks for the help.

929
00:57:42,427 --> 00:57:44,637
Thanks for making me dinner.

930
00:57:44,763 --> 00:57:46,435
Your sister is funny.

931
00:57:46,435 --> 00:57:46,895
You think?

932
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:50,481
Came here just to inspect, right?

933
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:53,129
It's just your impression.

934
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:56,058
It had to be blind not to realize.

935
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:28,131
<i>Ciao.</i>

936
01:01:29,744 --> 01:01:33,164
Do not wake up, do you?
The TV is too loud?

937
01:01:33,415 --> 01:01:36,115
No. I got up, I can not sleep.

938
01:01:39,385 --> 01:01:40,425
You do not?

939
01:01:41,961 --> 01:01:44,012
No, my medical
prescribed me some pills stupefying,.

940
01:01:44,012 --> 01:01:47,322
but I think they give me headaches in the morning.

941
01:01:50,701 --> 01:01:53,559
You know what Mark used to
do when unable to sleep?

942
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:54,069
What?

943
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,135
Beat jacking off.

944
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:02,404
Never worked for me, though.

945
01:02:02,404 --> 01:02:04,324
I stay awake all night.

946
01:02:15,347 --> 01:02:16,387
Mark you loved?

947
01:02:17,415 --> 01:02:18,055
Excuse me?

948
01:02:20,175 --> 01:02:21,215
Mark you loved?

949
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:23,517
Sure!

950
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:26,495
He was my best friend.

951
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:33,647
Were in love with him?

952
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:41,478
There was a time that was.

953
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:43,457
You were?

954
01:02:47,124 --> 01:02:48,224
In a way.

955
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,850
In a way it was.

956
01:02:55,462 --> 01:02:58,612
He would have liked to have when you know you.

957
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,820
I think you combine.

958
01:03:02,594 --> 01:03:03,634
You think?

959
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:06,037
Yes, certainly.

960
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,639
He knew what you felt for him.

961
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:20,320
He told you?

962
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:21,573
Yes.

963
01:03:23,794 --> 01:03:27,574
He greatly regretted not
feel the same thing for you.

964
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,340
I remember now the last thing he told me.

965
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:46,439
When I took the flight to Houston.

966
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:51,637
He asked me to convey his love to my mother.

967
01:03:53,216 --> 01:03:54,846
She liked him very much.

968
01:03:59,363 --> 01:04:01,683
It was the last thing I said.

969
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,285
What was the last thing you said?

970
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:18,269
Can not wait to know how you smell.

971
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,256
Which one do you think your the most corny?

972
01:04:22,256 --> 01:04:25,745
The last thing he told me,
or the last thing I said?

973
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:27,615
Both are very heartburn.

974
01:04:27,973 --> 01:04:29,073
Yes, they are.

975
01:04:34,236 --> 01:04:37,146
What was the last thing you said?

976
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:46,473
See you when I return.

977
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,950
Got something you'd like thee see.

978
01:05:09,025 --> 01:05:13,960
<i>I have observed you,
in your eyes and your smile,</i>

979
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:17,248
<i>is difficult to admit this to you,</i>

980
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:23,338
<i>but every night I go to bed,
thou have in mind,</i>

981
01:05:23,944 --> 01:05:27,671
<i>hardly sleep at night.</i>

982
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:29,032
<i>I'm dreaming,</i>

983
01:05:29,302 --> 01:05:30,817
<i>three times per minute,</i>

984
01:05:31,383 --> 01:05:33,338
<i>Baby, you're it.</i>

985
01:05:33,604 --> 01:05:36,894
<i>Do not you let me be your man?</i>

986
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,001
<i>I'm dreaming,</i>

987
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,627
<i>five times per minute,</i>

988
01:05:41,284 --> 01:05:43,065
<i>Baby, I admit.</i>

989
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:50,721
<i>Come on, let me be,
Come on, let me be your man.</i>

990
01:05:58,819 --> 01:05:59,279
You know,

991
01:05:59,942 --> 01:06:01,547
when I first saw you,

992
01:06:01,547 --> 01:06:02,127
online.

993
01:06:03,741 --> 01:06:06,311
He had a strange feeling in mind.

994
01:06:08,106 --> 01:06:11,622
<i>Now I simply adore you,</i>

995
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:13,811
<i>and every night</i>

996
01:06:14,622 --> 01:06:17,089
<i>when I'm in bed,</i>

997
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:17,905
<i>I'm dreaming,</i>

998
01:06:18,453 --> 01:06:19,743
<i>three times per minute,</i>

999
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:22,349
<i>Baby, you're it.</i>

1000
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:25,938
<i>Do not you let me be your man?</i>

1001
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,164
<i>I'm dreaming,</i>

1002
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:29,662
<i>five times per minute,</i>

1003
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,060
<i>Baby, I admit.</i>

1004
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:40,380
<i>Come on, let me be,
Come on, let me be your man.</i>

1005
01:06:52,494 --> 01:06:54,774
<i>Hope to see you soon Andrea.</i>

1006
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:58,302
<i>There are so many things here that you want to show.</i>

1007
01:06:58,525 --> 01:07:01,325
<i>And then I met my friend Jeff.</i>

1008
01:07:01,657 --> 01:07:04,107
<i>I'm sure you'll like.</i>

1009
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:05,469
<i>Ciao!</i>

1010
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:05,758
Toma.

1011
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,060
Thank you.

1012
01:08:14,072 --> 01:08:14,822
Are you okay?

1013
01:08:17,281 --> 01:08:17,621
Yes.

1014
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:24,337
What time is your flight tomorrow?

1015
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:27,639
At about half past nine.

1016
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,032
It's getting very late.

1017
01:08:33,474 --> 01:08:35,334
You should go get some sleep.

1018
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:40,638
You need anything else?

1019
01:08:43,193 --> 01:08:43,533
No.

1020
01:08:49,156 --> 01:08:50,119
Good evening Jeff.

1021
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:51,339
Good evening Andrea.

1022
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:58,559
It sets my alarm clock, not to fall asleep.

1023
01:08:59,152 --> 01:09:00,082
Ok, thanks.

1024
01:15:23,175 --> 01:15:25,279
You're going to Genoa from New York?

1025
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,419
It is a flight from JFK to London

1026
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,058
after London to Rome

1027
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:29,285
and then Rome to Genoa.

1028
01:15:29,285 --> 01:15:30,435
It's a long flight.

1029
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,483
Thank you for inviting me.

1030
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:38,297
You are very welcome.

1031
01:15:38,297 --> 01:15:39,627
Glad I came.

1032
01:15:40,267 --> 01:15:42,307
Glad we met.

1033
01:16:00,009 --> 01:16:02,227
Please keep in touch.

1034
01:16:02,227 --> 01:16:02,867
Keep.

1035
01:16:03,361 --> 01:16:05,483
You should come visit me in Italy.

1036
01:16:05,483 --> 01:16:05,823
Yes?

1037
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:06,451
Yes.

1038
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:10,473
May is the best time is spring there.

1039
01:16:11,464 --> 01:16:12,154
Okay.

1040
01:16:13,232 --> 01:16:17,665
I must warn you now, though. Genoa
is not as pretty as you think that Italy is.

1041
01:16:17,665 --> 01:16:19,585
Dallas also is not beautiful.

1042
01:16:21,884 --> 01:16:22,694
Ciao, Jeff!

1043
01:16:24,728 --> 01:16:25,658
Ciao, Andrea!
