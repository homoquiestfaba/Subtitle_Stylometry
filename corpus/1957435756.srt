in formal education,

for in experience.

Is this one your favorite?

00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,996
Or this?

She thinks it's her hair,

but it's your failure.

I was gonna tell you.

When?
When the damn album came out?

they're young like Aretha...

not because they're Negroes.

(CROWD APPLAUDS SOFTLY)

1760
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,410
He kept telling me

1761
01:44:09,036 --> 01:44:10,829
that they were
gonna get him.

1762
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:17,336
But I said, "Martin, the Lord
has more for you to do.

1763
01:44:18,003 --> 01:44:20,464
"You're gonna be
all right."

1764
01:44:22,507 --> 01:44:23,759
But he knew.

1765
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:26,595
He knew.

1766
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:30,432
Other ministers
were jealous of him,

1767
01:44:31,266 --> 01:44:32,976
but I never was.

1768
01:44:33,644 --> 01:44:35,604
He was my friend.

1769
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,523
I ministered him,

1770
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:40,067
advised him.

1771
01:44:40,776 --> 01:44:42,277
Prayed with him.

1772
01:44:43,445 --> 01:44:46,031
More time than I can count.

1773
01:44:48,742 --> 01:44:50,118
I loved him, Ree.

1774
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:52,204
He loved you.

1775
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:58,877
Who's gonna lead us now?

1776
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:02,547
They don't listen
to me anymore.

1777
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:06,093
You still have
the biggest church in Detroit.

1778
01:45:07,094 --> 01:45:08,804
I still know
how to get 'em goin'.

1779
01:45:09,429 --> 01:45:10,806
I do.

1780
01:45:10,889 --> 01:45:11,890
CLARA: Can I join you?

1781
01:45:12,516 --> 01:45:14,893
No. I just wanna talk to Ree.
Can I do that?

1782
01:45:15,143 --> 01:45:16,621
- Can I just talk to Ree?
- Of course you can.

1783
01:45:16,645 --> 01:45:18,397
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
- Of course you can.

1784
01:45:20,107 --> 01:45:22,359
I'll be right there
when you need me.

1785
01:45:24,653 --> 01:45:26,571
They need leadership, Ree.

1786
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:30,075
You should see the way
these fools

1787
01:45:30,283 --> 01:45:33,412
are steppin' over Martin's body
to be in charge.

1788
01:45:33,704 --> 01:45:35,747
I don't want
no part of that.

1789
01:45:36,999 --> 01:45:40,627
And these young revolutionaries
out here,

1790
01:45:40,794 --> 01:45:42,546
they don't want
no part of what we built.

1791
01:45:43,922 --> 01:45:46,383
They want to free our people.

1792
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:48,176
They all talk.

1793
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:51,138
Not all of them.
I like Angela Davis.

1794
01:45:52,973 --> 01:45:55,100
She don't care about
public opinion

1795
01:45:55,267 --> 01:45:59,354
and she's not afraid to speak up
to those pigs or anyone else.

1796
01:45:59,604 --> 01:46:02,065
- Pigs?
- Yes, pigs.

1797
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:04,460
You saw what they did to us
during the rebellion.

1798
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:06,278
Riots.

1799
01:46:06,445 --> 01:46:08,363
Why shouldn't
we fight back?

1800
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:11,158
And start a full-on war?
You think we can win that?

1801
01:46:11,324 --> 01:46:12,969
We're tired of
gettin' our heads kicked in.

1802
01:46:12,993 --> 01:46:17,873
Non-violence got us our civil rights
and our right to vote.

1803
01:46:18,415 --> 01:46:19,875
At what price?
Our souls?

1804
01:46:20,042 --> 01:46:21,418
Our dignity?

1805
01:46:22,461 --> 01:46:23,462
Hmm.

1806
01:46:26,757 --> 01:46:28,383
I've been thinking.

1807
01:46:30,886 --> 01:46:32,763
We should
hit the road again.

1808
01:46:35,474 --> 01:46:36,558
Why not?

1809
01:46:36,725 --> 01:46:38,226
A northern tour.

1810
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:41,897
- Me preachin' and you singin'.
- Mm-mm.

1811
01:46:44,649 --> 01:46:47,194
Just think on it.

1812
01:46:47,819 --> 01:46:49,321
You don't gotta
decide tonight.

1813
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:51,156
I'm not doing that, Daddy.

1814
01:46:52,491 --> 01:46:55,952
I know you got your very busy tourin'
and recordin' schedule.

1815
01:46:56,119 --> 01:46:58,014
This won't interfere with that.
I won't interfere with that.

1816
01:46:58,038 --> 01:46:59,289
No.

1817
01:47:00,791 --> 01:47:02,793
I'm done with that.

1818
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,670
I can't go back
to headlining with you.

1819
01:47:12,094 --> 01:47:14,846
You're not walkin'
in the spirit anymore. (SNIFFS)

1820
01:47:16,556 --> 01:47:18,850
That is not true.

1821
01:47:19,017 --> 01:47:21,978
You're drinking
and you're whoring around.

1822
01:47:22,145 --> 01:47:23,230
Same as you!

1823
01:47:23,396 --> 01:47:25,249
You not too old for me
to knock you on your ass!

1824
01:47:25,273 --> 01:47:26,834
- You know that, right?
- Is everything all right?

1825
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:29,152
Just mind your own business!
I'm talkin' to...

1826
01:47:29,319 --> 01:47:30,695
Don't talk to her like that.

1827
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:32,948
Have you lost
your mind? Huh?

1828
01:47:33,115 --> 01:47:34,699
Maybe.

1829
01:47:35,075 --> 01:47:37,035
Maybe I found it.

1830
01:47:40,372 --> 01:47:42,290
- Come on, let's get you to bed.
- Just...

1831
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:45,335
Just don't.

1832
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,431
(SOFTLY)
I heard your conversation.

1833
01:47:59,474 --> 01:48:00,559
I'm not sorry.

1834
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:03,311
No, you ain't got
nothin' to be sorry for.

1835
01:48:04,646 --> 01:48:06,731
Just do
your thing, Ree.

1836
01:48:07,524 --> 01:48:11,987
And you do it as big
and as loud

1837
01:48:12,195 --> 01:48:14,072
and as long as you can.

1838
01:48:58,033 --> 01:49:00,744
Please, just
listen to it again, okay?

1839
01:49:00,911 --> 01:49:02,829
I have a great feeling about
this song,

1840
01:49:03,038 --> 01:49:04,873
and The Beatles
are getting restless.

1841
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,334
They said if you don't do it,
they will.

1842
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,336
The song is Catholic, Jerry.

1843
01:49:09,502 --> 01:49:11,087
I'm a Baptist.

1844
01:49:11,254 --> 01:49:12,422
That's crazy.

1845
01:49:13,006 --> 01:49:14,341
They caught Angela Davis.

1846
01:49:14,507 --> 01:49:16,009
- What?
- That can't be right.

1847
01:49:16,176 --> 01:49:17,677
No, no, no.

Angela Davis must go free.

1854
01:49:34,819 --> 01:49:36,988
Black people will be free.

1855
01:49:37,614 --> 01:49:39,950
My daddy says I don't know
what I'm doing.

1856
01:49:40,116 --> 01:49:44,663
I respect him, of course,
but I have to stick by my beliefs.

1857
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:49,584
You have to disturb the peace
when you can't get no peace.

1858
01:49:55,757 --> 01:49:58,718
What the hell is this tour schedule?
Half the damn dates are gone!

1859
01:49:58,885 --> 01:50:01,489
All right, all right, we were just about
to have a talk with you about this.

1860
01:50:01,513 --> 01:50:02,722
We?

1861
01:50:02,889 --> 01:50:04,599
We're not having
a family barbecue?

1862
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,827
This is one of these
Ken hippie talks?

1863
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:08,353
I told you
this wasn't gonna work.

1864
01:50:08,436 --> 01:50:09,437
Just breathe.

1865
01:50:09,604 --> 01:50:10,689
Put the damn dates back.

1866
01:50:10,772 --> 01:50:11,916
Don't do it, Cecil.
Listen, Ree...

1867
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:12,941
You work for me, Cecil.

1868
01:50:13,024 --> 01:50:14,192
CECIL: You overbook.

1869
01:50:14,276 --> 01:50:17,171
You don't show up for half the dates,
then I have to deal with the fallout.

1870
01:50:17,195 --> 01:50:18,280
It's your damn job!

1871
01:50:18,363 --> 01:50:19,548
ERMA: We're trying
to help you.

1872
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:21,116
Aretha, you need
to slow down.

1873
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,285
You stop for five minutes,
they forget all about you.

1874
01:50:23,368 --> 01:50:24,577
That's ridiculous.

1875
01:50:24,661 --> 01:50:26,871
How would you know, Erma?
You barely have one hit.

1876
01:50:27,038 --> 01:50:28,581

CAROLYN: And you look like it.

1878
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,603
You don't want me to tell you
what you look like, Carolyn.

1879
01:50:32,627 --> 01:50:34,921
Well, next time
you have a breakdown,

1880
01:50:35,255 --> 01:50:36,589
don't call us, all right?

1881
01:50:39,676 --> 01:50:40,677
I won't.

1882
01:50:41,886 --> 01:50:43,197
Come on, let's go outside.
Come on.

1883
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:45,807
ARETHA: And don't call me
when you need a gig

1884
01:50:45,974 --> 01:50:49,769
or you want me to write liner notes
in your jive-ass album

1885
01:50:49,978 --> 01:50:52,439
or introduce you
to some producers,

1886
01:50:52,605 --> 01:50:55,984
or just borrow some cash
that your ass never pay back.

1887
01:50:56,151 --> 01:50:58,611
If I don't work,
y'all don't eat.

1888
01:50:59,946 --> 01:51:01,156
Right.

1889
01:51:01,323 --> 01:51:02,991
Put the damn dates
back, Cecil.

1890
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:10,123
Three venues in three states
in three days.

1891
01:51:10,457 --> 01:51:12,334
- Happy now?
- Yes, I am.

1892
01:51:13,084 --> 01:51:15,420
And don't ever pull that
bullshit with me again.

1893
01:51:15,587 --> 01:51:17,422
I know how to run
my damn business.

1894
01:51:18,173 --> 01:51:19,758
You asked me.

1895
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:21,801
Y'all just wanna
take my crown.

1896
01:51:21,968 --> 01:51:23,678
- Oh, God.
- Please.

1897
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,931
Ree, think about our son.
This isn't good for him.

1898
01:51:27,098 --> 01:51:28,767
Don't tell me
I'm a bad mother.

1899
01:51:28,933 --> 01:51:30,494
- Here comes the paranoia.
- KEN: I never said that!

1900
01:51:30,518 --> 01:51:32,812
Olga, bring Miss Franklin
a fruit juice.

1901
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:34,606
Don't you dare.

1902
01:51:36,232 --> 01:51:38,777
What you staring at?
Go get my lunch.

1903
01:51:39,069 --> 01:51:40,487
Yes, ma'am.

1904
01:51:42,405 --> 01:51:44,032
Tell me y'all don't want
what I got.

1905
01:51:44,199 --> 01:51:45,319
CECIL: All right, forget it!

1906
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:47,619
I can't talk to you
when that demon takes hold.

1907
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:50,580
You don't know
what I go through.

1908
01:51:50,705 --> 01:51:52,707
Y'all don't know
what I've been through!

1909
01:51:52,791 --> 01:51:53,792
We love you, Ree.

1910
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:55,627
Why can't you
see that, Ree?

1911
01:51:56,086 --> 01:51:57,837
Get the hell out of my house.

1912
01:51:58,004 --> 01:51:59,899
No, don't move.
We're going to deal with this, Ree.

1913
01:51:59,923 --> 01:52:01,174
Out!

1914
01:52:02,759 --> 01:52:03,760
Out!

1915
01:52:05,637 --> 01:52:06,638
Out!

1916
01:52:09,974 --> 01:52:11,559
Come on, baby, please...

1917
01:52:14,062 --> 01:52:17,148
Ree, listen to me.
They're here to help you.

1919
