1
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,379
- Vodka?
- Sure.

2
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,381
Do you go to school here,
or are you following me?

3
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,009
Me following you?

4
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,577
Yeah, I saw you today
in the city.

5
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,783
You were staring at me.

6
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,226
Is that something you do...
stare at girls in the subway?

7
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,926
I don't know. Did you follow me
all the way here to ask me that?

8
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,732
I go to school here,
but I haven't seen you.

9
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,897
I'm new.
I'm the new professor...

10
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,566
in the agricultural studies
department.

11
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,075
There is no agricultural
studies department.

12
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,908
Well, you see, that's the thing.
Poultry... it's a new thing.

13
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,881
I'm like a poultry specialist,
so I'm here to supervise.

14
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,610
I know, you're thinking
I'm too young, right?

15
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,278
You're thinking,
"How could this guy...

16
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,914
"have such a vast understanding
of the domesticated fowl?"

17
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,423
I could tell you,
if you're interested.

18
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,722
- Are there any mixers?
- Mixers?

19
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,292
Chicken!

20
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,323
You see...

21
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,664
What are you doing
with my friend's chicken?

22
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,907
I don't know.
What would you like me to do...

23
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,608
with your friend's chicken?

24
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,310
Coitus.

25
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,945
- I dare you.
- You dare me?

26
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,319
What do you dare me to do?

27
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,074
Would you think
I was being too forward...

28
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,702
if I said,
"Let's go back to your room"?

29
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,688
What would you say if I said,
"Let's go back to my room"?

30
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,060
But let's bring Thea.

31
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,017
I can't...

32
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,448
I'm sorry.

33
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,356
Why should you be sorry?
I'm sorry.

34
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,359
No, I am. I'm sorry.

35
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,453
Well, you shouldn't be sorry.
I had fun.

36
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,662
You did?

37
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,691
Yeah. Didn't you?

38
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,299
I guess.

39
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,274
What do you mean, you guess?

40
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,176
I mean, I guess I had fun,
but I felt bad, I guess.

41
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,613
I mean, the whole thing
was a little weird, I guess.

42
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,618
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

43
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,949
I thought it would be fun.

44
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,684
No, don't apologize.
I thought it'd be fun, too.

45
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,884
Thea had fun.

46
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,427
But she's sorry, too.

47
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,365
So, we're all sorry,
but we all had fun.

48
00:08:56,168 --> 00:09:00,002
So, are you and Thea,
like, hangin' out?

49
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,305
Yeah, but not like that.

50
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,504
I mean, we're friends.

51
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,651
So, what are you doing
this weekend?

52
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,781
I don't know. Nothin'.
What are you doing?

53
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,020
Shit!

54
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,428
So, what do you do?

55
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,333
I'm an animator.

56
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,397
I ink animation cels
for this shitty ad firm.

57
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,375
But I also do
some of my own stuff.

58
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,378
Where are you from?

59
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,539
Here and there.

60
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,039
My parents
moved around a lot, so...

61
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,352
Can't we talk about
something else?

62
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,252
Like how beautiful you are?

63
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,440
What are we doing?

64
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,146
What do you mean?

65
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,522
I mean, what are we doing?

66
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,252
What do you want out of this?

67
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,893
I don't know.

68
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,228
What do you want?

69
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,630
I like you.

70
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,165
I like sleeping with you.

71
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,370
I like waking up with you.

72
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,780
What about you?

73
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,840
I like you, too.

74
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,578
I don't want to play any games.

75
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,111
Me, neither.

76
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,152
But I don't want to, like...

77
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,319
put any rules on you
or anything, either.

78
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,330
Oh, me, neither. I mean that.

79
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,355
I just think
the most important thing...

80
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,027
is that we're honest
with each other...

81
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,229
that we let each other know
what's going on...

82
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,239
and not lie about anything.

83
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,400
Of course.

84
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,602
I'm not playing any games.

85
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,015
Are you sure it's Ok?

86
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,577
Yeah, it's cool.

87
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,216
It is a little weird,
don't you think?

88
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,994
We...

89
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,123
I mean, we don't want it
to change anything.

90
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,564
We don't want
to make you feel weird.

91
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,436
Coles!

92
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,106
What...?

93
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,707
Come on!

94
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,686
Hello, everybody.

95
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,142
What's goin' on?

96
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,648
There's a party
in a warehouse in Brooklyn.

97
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,240
It's like a rave or something.

98
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,253
I thought we were gonna have
a nice, quiet night in tonight.

99
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,187
Oh, we won't stay for long.
It'll be fun.

100
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,432
I was kind of looking forward...

101
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,265
to just
hanging out and doing nothing.

102
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,737
But we can do that any night.

103
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,865
Yeah, but the thing is,
is we don't.

104
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,541
Come here.

105
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,278
What for?

106
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,785
- Just a sec.
- What?

107
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,787
It's right here in my hand.

108
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,400
Come on.

109
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,373
Come on, it'll be fun.

110
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,400
We'll leave immediately
if it's not, I promise.

111
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,403
I can't just ditch those guys.

112
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,765
Where's Coles?

113
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,206
He went home.

114
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,975
That was a long cab ride.

115
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,769
I want this.

116
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,330
Can I have it?
Can I have this one?

117
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,365
I'll be in a minute.

118
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,857
Sam.

119
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,962
Sam, I'm gonna go in, Ok?

120
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,880
Stop.

121
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,316
Turn out the light.

122
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,632
Melissa, honey. We're leaving.

123
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,604
Holy shit!

124
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,300
I left the number of
the hotel on the kitchen table.

125
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,035
This is amazing!

126
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,011
Jesus.

127
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,481
Good-bye, Mr. And Mrs. Barnes!

128
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,176
This is amazing.

129
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,212
So, what do you guys want to do?

130
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,118
I don't know.

131
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,056
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

132
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,857
I told Sid I'd call him.

133
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,657
Your lame-ass roommate?
Please don't.

134
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,596
Fuck off. Sid rocks.

135
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,899
Hey, is Sid there?

136
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,375
Hey, what's up?

137
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,345
Nothin'.
Just chillin' like Bob Dylan.

138
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,040
Come over.

139
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,572
No, you have no excuse, Ok?

140
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,390
Hey! Wait for me!
I'm gonna get dressed.

141
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,898
Wait, don't open the door!

142
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,267
Hey, Sid! Come on in.
Take a load off.

143
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,066
You guys are crazy, huh?

144
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,602
Ooh, thank you! Merry Christmas!

145
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,238
So, what are you on?

146
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,714
Come on in.

147
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,045
Sid, what do you want
to be when you grow up, son?

148
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,851
Come on, Sid.
You have to do better than that.

149
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,293
- Sid's gonna be a writer.
- Oh, yeah?

150
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,592
He is. He's like
the most amazing writer I know.

151
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,394
He writes all my papers for me.

152
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,833
I don't actually write
all her... I mean, I help her.

153
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,032
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really?

154
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,131
What about you, Coles?
What do you want to do?

155
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,642
I'm never growing up.

156
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,539
- What about you, Thea?
- What about me?

157
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,274
What are you gonna be when
you grow up? Sid's manager?

158
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,781
Or maybe you should be
a writer, too...

159
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,682
and then Sid could do
all of your writing for you.

160
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,982
No, I don't actually
write all her papers.

161
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,182
Ok, Sid! Damn it!

162
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,283
I'm gonna be...

163
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,351
a country and western singer.

164
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,429
I'm fine.

165
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,310
No. No hair in there. No hair.

166
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,280
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

167
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:20,149
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of her.

168
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,048
What do you want to do, really?

169
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,293
I want to make movies.

170
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,727
What kind of movies?

171
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:34,528
Movies that make people think...

172
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,034
like, about my butt.

173
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,936
Sometimes it seems
like you're scared...

174
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,035
to take anything seriously.

175
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,273
Like...

176
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,077
you're afraid that if
you say what you really feel...

177
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,243
that people will criticize you.

178
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:58,086
So you only joke around
all the time.

179
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,183
Do you think that's true?

180
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,386
Maybe.

181
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:11,402
Or maybe I just don't
take anything seriously.

182
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,533
Thanks, Sid.

183
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,444
You're really good to me.

184
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,277
You'd do the same for me.

185
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,078
No, I wouldn't.

186
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,682
You're not a fucking mess
like me.

187
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,587
You're not a fucking fuck-up
like I am.

188
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,221
You're not a fuck-up, Thea.

189
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:42,063
You just need some sleep, Ok?

190
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,440
Sid?

191
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,238
Can I ask you a question?

192
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,574
Sure.

193
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:57,013
Do you love me?

194
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,449
Yeah, of course I love you.

195
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:04,080
No, I mean,
do you think I'm a good person?

196
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,153
Oh, shit.

197
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,298
You're not dressed?

198
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,901
- What?
- You're not out of bed?

199
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,308
I'm out of bed.

200
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,947
I fucked Sid last night.

201
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,648
What?

202
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,214
You fucked Sid?

203
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,920
- Sid Sid?
- Yeah.

204
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,920
Thea! Do you think
that was a good idea?

205
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,330
You guys are friends.

206
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,243
I know, I know.

207
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:04,180
It might have been a dipshit
move. I can't decide yet.

208
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,017
- No, I mean, really.
- Whatever, you know.

209
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,921
What's a little fucking
among friends, right?

210
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,359
I'm gonna go
and get some brunch.

211
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,094
Ok. Do you want to wait for me?

212
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,897
I'll see you down there.

213
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,698
Ok. I'll meet you there.

214
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:31,964
As a kid, did you always know...

215
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,493
what you wanted to be
when you grew up?

216
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,165
Why do you ask?

217
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,643
You never really
answer anything, do you?

218
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,542
Except with another question.

219
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,206
When I was a kid,
I wanted to grow up...

220
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,306
to be powerful enough
that no one could do anything...

221
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,783
when I shit all over 'em.

222
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,445
What if I said that?

223
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,717
I'd say that's great, Coles.

224
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,780
At least
you're saying something.

225
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,588
But you're not. You're saying,
"What if I said that?"

226
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:03,292
Have you... have you
been seeing other people?

227
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,602
What?
It's just a simple question.

228
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,801
Have you?

229
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,141
Have you?

230
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,510
Maybe.

231
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,205
"Maybe."

232
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,386
What do you mean, maybe?

233
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,287
Well, "Maybe" means
that may or may not be...

234
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,052
something I've been doing.

235
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,653
But we're not talking about me.
I asked you first.

236
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:48,802
Fine, yeah. I slept with a girl.

237
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,543
It was just sex, that's it.

238
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,914
Why?

239
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,521
I don't know. Why not?

240
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,858
What about you?

241
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,797
What about me?

242
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,800
Who did you sleep with?

243
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,499
Nobody.

244
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,004
I'm gonna leave.

245
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,373
Are you sure?

246
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:28,546
Yeah, yeah.
You have work to do.

247
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,454
I don't want you
to leave like this.

248
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,053
Like what?

249
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,894
Like this.
With us fighting like this.

250
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,399
We're not fighting.

251
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,926
It's not like I own you, right?

252
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,462
It's just...

253
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,565
It was just one thing
to talk about...

254
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,101
and I didn't know
how it would make me feel.

255
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,040
I love you, Ok?

256
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,210
What happened with that girl,
it didn't mean anything.

257
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,116
I just feel stupid.

258
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,486
Come on, don't feel stupid.

259
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,788
There's no reason to feel
stupid. It didn't mean anything.

260
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,919
I'll be fine.

261
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,831
I love you.

262
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:30,412
Get some work done.
I'll see you tonight.

263
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,390
Please don't cry.

264
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,955
Fuck.

265
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,463
Please don't.

266
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,295
I can't...

267
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,399
I just like...

268
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,785
I just want to be your friend.

269
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,796
I gotta go.
I'll see you tonight.

270
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,736
- I'm so glad you could make it.
- Hi! How are you?

271
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,503
- Good. How are you?
- Remember Sid?

272
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,171
Oh, hi, Sid. Come in.
I want to talk to you.

273
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,973
Let's just try
to have some fun, Ok?

274
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,918
Looking at my hands?

275
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,594
You have amazing hands.

276
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:59,194
I saw the cast of your hands
in the Biennial last year...

277
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,602
the bronze ones?

278
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:04,369
- They were beautiful.
- Thanks.

279
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,633
That's strange.

280
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,941
Not supposed to be wearing it.

281
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,606
Pig skin.

282
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,949
- Let me get inside these.
- No, no, no. Those stay on.

283
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,662
I was angry.

284
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,475
Can you find it in your heart
to forgive me?

285
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,281
I don't have a heart.

286
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,050
Yeah, you do.

287
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:05,552
It's just really little
and black.

288
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,657
This could make us stronger.

289
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,392
Don't you think?

290
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,155
Be very quiet, will you?

291
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,595
Don't say anything. Touch me.

292
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,250
Oh, I feel sick.

293
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,866
Where's Sam?

294
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,969
She's right there.

295
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,412
Is she coming?

296
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,469
I'm surprised that you're
so upset by this situation.

297
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,102
- What is this situation?
- This!

298
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,578
There is no situation...

299
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,104
except for you being
a complete fucking asshole!

300
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:23,246
It's like you planned this
to try and prove something.

301
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,278
But you know what?

302
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,883
That's fine, but I quit.

303
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,793
I quit. You win. Game over.

304
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,980
I'm sorry.

305
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,179
Fuck you.

306
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,085
Hold up there!

307
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,454
Come on, fella.

308
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,763
Hold him down!

309
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,201
Sam!

310
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,971
Fuck you, Sam! Fuck you!

311
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,045
Sid, I want to apolo...

312
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,524
Excuse me.

313
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,121
Are you Coles Burroughs,
the film director?

314
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:49,291
Yeah.
I did a film a few years ago.

315
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,824
I thought I recognized you.

316
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,305
I saw your picture once
in Filmmaker magazine...

317
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,704
and I saw your movie.

318
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,934
Really didn't like it very much.

319
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,580
I'm sorry.

320
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,051
I was kind of wondering...

321
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:10,314
could I have my money back?

322
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,023
You know that ticket
that you bought?

323
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,552
I didn't get
any of that money, you know.

324
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,292
That all went
to the distributors...

325
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,665
and the executive producers.
I didn't see a dime.

326
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,294
But you made it.

327
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,632
You're responsible.

328
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,675
What was it, eight bucks?

329
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,476
Nineteen. I took a girl.

330
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,176
She didn't like it
at all, either.

331
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,242
She said she thought
it was morally reprehensible.

332
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,776
Especially
the depiction of women.

333
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,381
All right, there you go.

334
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,325
And tell your girlfriend
that I said I'm sorry.

335
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,794
Oh, no, we broke up.

336
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,668
Yeah. I'd also like
the tuna, please.

337
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,975
Yeah, and how long
do you think? Half hour?

338
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,110
That's great. Ok. Thanks.

339
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,263
So, I ordered you the tuna.

340
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,492
How was your day?

341
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,467
It was great. They loved
the dancing taco idea.

342
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,663
Oh, the insidiously racist taco.

343
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,969
- Just what they wanted.
- That's great.

344
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,168
What is with you?

345
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,211
August first.

346
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,841
Oh, my God. I knew
I was forgetting something.

347
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,875
- You forgot?
- Honey, I totally forgot.

348
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:53,015
I'm so sorry.

349
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,615
I'm kidding.

350
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,092
I got you
the Claire Denis boxed set.

351
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,394
You got me a picture of
some videotapes! That's great!

352
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:07,962
It's not coming in until
next week, so until then, yeah.

353
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,030
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

354
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,304
Open yours.

355
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,951
It's an autographed copy.

356
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,285
They... it's a first edition.

357
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,188
Oh, that's beautiful, Coles.

358
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,128
"D is for demon."

359
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,663
Thank you.

360
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,876
Just eat me!

361
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:54,316
Taco man! Just eat it!

362
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,650
Maybe we could try music
that's a little less ethnic.

363
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,916
Of course.

364
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,322
- Looks great, though.
- Oh, yeah.

365
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,826
Just get rid of that music,
and I think we got a home run.

366
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,726
Great. Thanks, Rick.

367
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,754
Hey, keep up the good work,
Coles.

368
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,734
I felt a really great
connection there.

369
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,329
Did you feel it?
You feel it? You feel it?

370
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,739
Who's this... is that me?

371
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,802
Yeah. I think so, yeah.

372
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,294
- You look great!
- So do you!

373
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,632
I heard that you were married.

374
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,337
- Thea is, did you know that?
- No. Have you two kept in touch?

375
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,747
Yeah. We reconnected
a few years ago...

376
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:03,014
and her husband owns
this restaurant... Theadora's.

377
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:06,113
Theadora's is named after Thea?

378
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,521
Do you know it?

379
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,321
Yeah.
I've definitely heard of it.

380
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,488
I've never been there, but...
is it nice?

381
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,589
I don't know.
I haven't been, either.

382
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,261
I just got back into town on...
last week.

383
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,904
Where from? Where you been?

384
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,501
London. Yeah, I just moved back.

385
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,776
You want to go get a drink
or something? Coffee? Catch up?

386
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:35,046
Yeah. I can't right now,
but I would love to.

387
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,882
I...

388
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,821
Let me give you the number
of my parents' flat.

389
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,983
If it's what it was,
I still have it.

390
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,549
Yeah, it's the same.

391
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,824
I'm going to be living there
since they don't really use it.

392
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,763
I'll call you.

393
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,095
Good.

394
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,109
So...

395
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,636
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

396
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,401
Sam,
there's a Thea on the line.

397
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,067
Oh, thanks, Lisa!

398
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,770
Thea, you look great.

399
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,574
Thanks. So do you.

400
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,740
- The blond is nice.
- You like it?

401
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,715
I don't know what to do with it.

402
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,581
Miles wants me to grow it out
natural color...

403
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,385
but you know what?
Fuck him!

404
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,117
When are you gonna come
to the restaurant?

405
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,126
God, I don't know. This week
has been totally crazy.

406
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,424
It'll settle down soon.

407
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,422
I'm having lunch
with Coles tomorrow.

408
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,766
What? Did you call him?

409
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,295
No, I ran into him,
like, at the gym.

410
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,467
You just happened
to run into him at the gym?

411
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,669
What, are you, like,
stalking him?

412
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,769
No, it was a total coincidence.

413
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,448
It was, I swear to God.

414
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,314
So, what's he doing?

415
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,751
Well, I don't know. We didn't
really have time to catch up.

416
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,914
Is he still making movies?

417
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,617
I don't know. I guess so.

418
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,785
Did you ever end up
seeing his movie?

419
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,497
I liked it. I mean...

420
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:32,525
it was kind of weird
to see, but...

421
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,434
Why don't you guys
both come for dinner?

422
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,995
Or would that be too...

423
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,009
I think that he has
a serious girlfriend.

424
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,534
I don't know. Something
gave me that impression.

425
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,144
Sam, don't even think about it.

426
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:52,246
I know. But still...

427
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,553
I don't actually write
all her papers.

428
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,252
Ok, Sid. Damn it!

429
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:59,057
I'm gonna be
a country and western singer.

430
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,864
What about you, Sam? What are
you gonna be when you grow up?

431
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,665
I don't know what I want to do.

432
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,868
I'd like to do something
that helps people, you know?

433
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,671
I'd like to give
something back.

434
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,904
How noble.

435
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,912
Hey, honey.

436
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,041
Hey, how was your day?

437
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,486
Can I just please tell you
how annoying mine was?

438
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,047
This woman calls me
forty times, right, in a row...

439
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,615
trying to get ahold of Bob.

440
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,956
Well, he's out of town.

441
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,393
I don't know why
I thought you were married.

442
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,920
I can't remember
who told me that.

443
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:39,560
We've been together for five
years, so we might as well be.

444
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,003
So, are you happy?

445
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,868
Oh, am I happy with Claire?

446
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,573
Oh, yes, very much so.
Of course.

447
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,445
So, how did you two meet?

448
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,020
Sorry, I don't mean to pry.

449
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,681
No, no, it's Ok.

450
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:02,249
We met because I was her boss.

451
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,455
And she was working for me...
or with me.

452
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,930
She was the art director.

453
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,058
She doesn't work with me
anymore.

454
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,239
So, what about you? No husband?

455
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:22,576
I was engaged in London
to a guy named Jonathan.

456
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,241
It was supposed to happen
next month...

457
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:29,412
but as it got closer,
I just started thinking...

458
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,320
that I was doing it
for the wrong reasons.

459
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,755
What are the right reasons?

460
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,760
I don't know.

461
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,162
So what?

462
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,290
What what?

463
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:46,666
What... what... what happened
to the fiancé?

464
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,570
I told him that I wasn't ready.

465
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,870
I left him in London...

466
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:56,573
and now I'm running around town
with some young guy.

467
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:59,975
That was quick.

468
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,417
Yeah, well,
it's nothing serious.

469
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:07,287
He's cute, he's young, and
I'm just having a little fun.

470
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,966
So, maybe we should all
get together sometime.

471
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,934
You know,
go out with three couples.

472
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,994
Well, you know,
Thea and Miles want us all...

473
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,598
to come to dinner next week,
if that works for you.

474
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,766
That sounds fun.

475
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,833
Unless you think
it might be awkward.

476
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,710
Awkward? No, it'll be fun.

477
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,888
Your hair looks great, Thea.

478
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,914
Yeah, I've never
seen your natural color.

479
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,291
Oh, it's not natural.
I added dye.

480
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,592
- Beige.
- Miles hates it.

481
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,461
I didn't say I hated it.
I like it.

482
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:52,662
Reminds of the pleather
in my grandparents' Lincoln.

483
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,672
It makes me feel
all warm and fuzzy.

484
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,697
Well, I think
it looks very nice.

485
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,003
Thank you, Claire.

486
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,875
So, Sam says you're an actor.

487
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,743
Yeah, man.
Yeah, that's my thing.

488
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,304
I'm not really workin'
right now, though.

489
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,816
I'm just kind of layin' low.

490
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,375
I'm not really into the whole
fame and success thing.

491
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,148
You know,
I saw that movie you made.

492
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,748
I thought it was pretty cool
that you made that shit.

493
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:14,916
Thanks.

494
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,687
I loved it.
I thought it was great.

495
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,853
Thank you.

496
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,726
You know
the Times reviewer guy?

497
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,663
What a fucking moron.
I mean...

498
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,928
obviously he hadn't
even seen the movie, right?

499
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,958
All critics
should be brought to a pulp...

500
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,300
and converted to paper.

501
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:28,565
Hear, hear.

502
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,335
Thank you for saying that.

503
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,139
So, are you working on
anything new, or...

504
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,371
I was, but...

505
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,380
What happened?

506
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,813
When you're working
on a movie...

507
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,875
there's a time before it
actually begins when you're...

508
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,854
you know, it's just ripe
with possibilities.

509
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:47,379
Is that what they say?
Is it "rife" or is it "ripe"?

510
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,222
"Rife"?
What the hell is "rife"?

511
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,023
I could never understand
"rife."

512
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,860
It means in widespread use,
prevalent, abundant.

513
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:58,265
It comes from the old English.

514
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,966
Very old. Very, very, very old.

515
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,803
Do you really want
to hear this?

516
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,206
Because I must sound
like a pompous hyp...

517
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,871
Really? Well...

518
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:12,939
well, in the beginning,
it's just...

519
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,178
anything is possible...

520
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,685
and it's really exciting.

521
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,881
But then, you know,
as the production begins...

522
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,719
there's
more and more compromises...

523
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,918
until eventually
nothing is possible...

524
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,825
and, you know,
it's only disappointing.

525
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:28,558
I just... I realized
I wasn't cut out for that.

526
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,999
I just wanted to do
a more personal kind of film...

527
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,698
and I just realized that...

528
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,135
I don't know what I realized.

529
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,146
Nothing, I guess.

530
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,341
So, what do you do now?

531
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,544
Advertising. I'm in commercials.

532
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,554
Oh, yeah? Anything we've seen?

533
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,613
Oh, probably not, no.

534
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:57,024
Actually, Coles did
all those "Taco Man" spots.

535
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,324
Oh, "Drop that taco"?

536
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,422
"Drop that taco"? We love those!

537
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,592
I love those!

538
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:04,793
Thank you.

539
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,796
Did you know "rife"?

540
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,806
I didn't know
it came from the old English.

541
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,138
I knew "rife."
I didn't know that.

542
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,336
You didn't know "rife."
You're full of shit.

543
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,039
Nobody did.
When I first brought it up...

544
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,603
everyone was totally confounded.

545
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:18,773
Except Tommy.

546
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,339
Right, but nobody else knew it.

547
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,147
I could sense it.
It was like a bond.

548
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,016
Actually, I think Miles
might've known "rife"...

549
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,453
and he was just being polite.

550
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,615
That's what it was.

551
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,283
It was impolite,
what that kid Tommy did.

552
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,587
It was as if he was
just waiting to jump in...

553
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,685
and make a fool out of me.

554
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,026
Old English, my ass!

555
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,032
He was just making that shit up.

556
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,398
You're crazy, you know that?

557
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,925
I'm lookin' it up.

558
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,631
You're a maniac!

559
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,229
Oh, yeah?
In what sense of the word?

560
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,740
As in born and bred in Maine?

561
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,767
No, as in crazy,
as in stark raving lunatic.

562
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,711
As in stark raving naked?

563
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,849
What does it say?

564
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,845
What did it say?

565
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,787
Whatever. It was rude.

566
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,620
You're right about one thing...
Sam can definitely do better.

567
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,527
He just seemed like a boob,
you know?

568
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,658
And she was really sweet.
I liked all of them a lot.

569
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,099
Thea seemed good.

570
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,675
I liked her husband. I thought
he was gonna be a prick.

571
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,233
He totally looked like a prick,
didn't he?

572
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,870
Then he turned out
to be really nice.

573
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,985
Whatever happened
that you guys all lost touch?

574
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,181
You know how those things are.

575
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,816
So, was it strange
after all this time?

576
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,094
Well, it just seems like
there's a part of you...

577
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,463
that's still
really drawn to Sam.

578
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:47,159
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, come on, honey.

579
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,762
I saw the way
you were looking at her.

580
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,569
And I think it's
perfectly normal. I mean...

581
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,132
It's nothing, Ok?
It was just weird.

582
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,668
I haven't seen her in ten years.
It was just weird, is all.

583
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,084
Do you remember
a long time ago...

584
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,091
when you and I
were first getting together...

585
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,253
and we had a conversation about
other people we'd been with?

586
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,886
I think we were drunk...

587
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,797
but you said something
that I never forgot.

588
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,801
You said
you don't believe in love.

589
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,827
We were drunk,
and I was being melodramatic.

590
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,499
I don't think so.

591
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,100
I think there was something
really telling about that.

592
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,304
You said that
you believed in love once...

593
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,313
but that
you'd learned your lesson.

594
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,144
And you said it was Sam.

595
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,207
You know, now you're the one
who's being melodramatic.

596
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,185
I'm not. And I'm not upset.

597
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,846
I'm just saying
that it seems normal...

598
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,220
that you would feel weird
seeing her, that's all.

599
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,454
I mean...
I can even accept...

600
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,961
that you might still have
certain feelings for her.

601
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,991
You know,
you really gotta stop this.

602
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,592
Why?
I'm not saying anything crazy.

603
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:52,966
I'm not getting angry...

604
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,995
and I feel like things
are gonna be fine.

605
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:01,503
I'm just trying to let you know
that it's Ok, you know?

606
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,945
I trust you.

607
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,448
And I trust us.

608
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,646
And I like your friends.

609
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,983
- I'm fine.
- Ok...

610
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,784
but I'm telling you
that you're crazy...

611
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,814
if you think there's anything
going on with me and Sam.

612
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,180
I don't know.
I felt bad, you know?

613
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,842
He's sweet,
but what are you gonna do?

614
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,077
Hold on. It's the door.

615
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:44,415
- Who's there?
- It's Coles.

616
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:49,652
Coles, hi.

617
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:52,923
I'll be down... I'm coming down.
Just wait.

618
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:57,589
- Thea?
- You gotta go?

619
00:53:57,633 --> 00:53:58,895
Coles is here.

620
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:00,834
What the fuck
is Coles doing there?

621
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:03,303
- I don't know.
- I do.

622
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:04,636
I'll call you back.

623
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:06,402
Ok. Make sure you ask him
about the weekend.

624
00:54:06,442 --> 00:54:08,171
Yeah, yeah, I'll ask him.

625
00:54:17,453 --> 00:54:19,284
Surprise.

626
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:20,481
Come in.

627
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:24,858
Thea says hello.

628
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:26,861
Oh. What,
did you just call her?

629
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:29,489
No, I was on the phone with her
when you buzzed.

630
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:32,261
Oh, right, yeah.

631
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:35,202
- So, come up.
- Sure.

632
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:43,968
She wanted me to ask you
if you and Claire...

633
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:46,538
wanted to come out to the beach
next weekend.

634
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:50,109
They have a place out there.
She, Miles and I are all going.

635
00:54:50,152 --> 00:54:51,380
If you and Claire...

636
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,389
Next weekend?
Yeah, that sounds fun. Sure.

637
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:57,017
I mean, I'll have to ask
to make sure...

638
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:59,118
but it should be fine, yeah.

639
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:07,325
Can I get you something?
Tea, coffee?

640
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:08,802
Tea would be great.

641
00:55:21,216 --> 00:55:25,744
So, to what do I owe
this surprise visit?

642
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:28,518
I don't know.
Just wanted to see you.

643
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:32,459
I've been thinking about you,
and... I don't know.

644
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:37,123
The other night was really nice.

645
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,793
It was, yeah.

646
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:41,530
Claire's great.

647
00:55:42,971 --> 00:55:46,338
Tommy seems cool. He's cute.
What is he, like, eighteen?

648
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:50,243
- I know. Don't say it.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

649
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:52,679
It's Ok. I got rid of him.

650
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:54,546
What happened?

651
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:59,084
It was only a matter of time.

652
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,817
The first time we hung out,
we went to a movie...

653
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:04,519
and just hearing
where he laughed...

654
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,289
I knew it wasn't gonna last.

655
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,492
I just thought
it'd be more fun.

656
00:56:29,251 --> 00:56:34,245
Sometimes I wonder what
it would've been like...

657
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:36,553
if we had managed
to stay together.

658
00:56:42,498 --> 00:56:46,434
We would've made
each other miserable.

659
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:49,528
Oh, my God.
We were really fucked up.

660
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:51,971
- We were a mess.
- The whole thing was a mess.

661
00:56:52,007 --> 00:56:55,135
We thought we were having such
a wild, fun time with Thea.

662
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:57,008
We didn't have a clue!

663
00:56:57,045 --> 00:57:00,014
We were so mean to each other.
Do you remember?

664
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:03,347
I was so angry.
I was such an asshole.

665
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:05,148
It was like we were animals...

666
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:07,348
like we had no concept
of control.

667
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:10,187
We just did whatever
we wanted to, no matter what.

668
00:57:10,225 --> 00:57:12,523
If it were then, we'd be
on the floor right now...

669
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:14,529
fucking like rabbits.

670
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:16,588
Fuck.

671
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:28,069
What?

672
00:57:31,146 --> 00:57:33,740
I was going to call you,
actually.

673
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:36,717
What for?

674
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:39,050
For two things...

675
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:41,487
to ask you about the weekend...

676
00:57:41,523 --> 00:57:44,151
and also because
I'm buying a car...

677
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:47,720
and I wanted to ask you about
what you thought I should get.

678
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:49,731
You know...

679
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,227
But then, I didn't want
to bother you.

680
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,830
No, it's fine. I don't mind.
What were you thinking?

681
00:57:57,873 --> 00:57:59,898
I don't know.
I was just gonna go down...

682
00:57:59,942 --> 00:58:02,206
and drive
a few different things.

683
00:58:02,244 --> 00:58:05,304
- I'll go with you.
- You don't have to do that.

684
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:07,508
It'll be fun. I want to do it.

685
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:15,216
I guess I should get going.

686
00:58:20,095 --> 00:58:22,325
I...

687
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:31,803
should go.

688
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:48,614
- What?
- Nothing.

689
00:58:48,657 --> 00:58:50,056
What's the matter?

690
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:51,889
Nothing.

691
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:54,691
Do you mind if I change this?
It's bugging me.

692
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,063
Ok. Sure.

693
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:04,569
- Are you Ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

694
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,201
Hey.

695
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:11,875
What's on your mind, baby?

696
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,575
Nothing.

697
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:27,928
I like it!

698
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:30,431
- Well, we'll take it.
- Sold.

699
00:59:30,465 --> 00:59:32,228
Sold.

700
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:35,832
I can't believe Thea's married.

701
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:39,804
You and Claire
have been together...

702
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:41,604
for five years, you said?

703
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:44,441
It was five years August first.

704
00:59:45,881 --> 00:59:48,850
You even know the date.

705
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:51,648
When we were together,
you weren't the kind of guy...

706
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:54,952
who kept track
of stuff like that.

707
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,550
It's almost like I'm sensitive.

708
00:59:57,593 --> 01:00:00,528
It's like you're married.

709
01:00:04,466 --> 01:00:07,026
Yeah, I guess so.

710
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:14,574
Do you want to come in?

711
01:00:29,524 --> 01:00:32,982
Coles, it's so nice.

712
01:00:33,028 --> 01:00:35,360
Yeah, we've been here
about four years.

713
01:01:23,011 --> 01:01:25,343
Can I get you something?

714
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:30,477
- Tea, or...
- Yeah, sure.

715
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,680
Maybe something herbal?

716
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:22,327
I just can't tonight.
But thank you so much.

717
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:26,272
- Hi. What time is it?
- It's just after 4:00.

718
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:28,173
I left work early.
I was just trying...

719
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,178
to talk Sam into
joining us for dinner.

720
01:02:30,212 --> 01:02:33,010
I would love to,
but I'm already running late.

721
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:35,380
Sam was just leaving.

722
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:36,782
I'll walk you out.

723
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:38,786
Well, next time, then.

724
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,447
And next weekend, right?

725
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:42,150
Yeah.

726
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,890
I'm sorry about all of this.

727
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,952
All what?

728
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:54,367
You mean, surprising me?
It's nothing.

729
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:58,065
I wish you could stay
for dinner.

730
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:03,204
- Well, I'll see you soon.
- It was good to see you.

731
01:03:56,231 --> 01:03:57,596
What?

732
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:00,064
Nothing.

733
01:04:13,348 --> 01:04:16,511
Just eat me.

734
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:19,679
Taco man! Just eat it!

735
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:23,020
I still say... classic rock.

736
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:26,459
But Rick, I don't give a shit
what you say.

737
01:04:26,494 --> 01:04:28,689
You're joking, right?

738
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,028
What gives you that impression?

739
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:41,399
Just fuckin' with you, Rick.

740
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,707
I love classic rock.
It's so classic.

741
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:46,179
This guy kills me.
You really had me goin', Coles.

742
01:04:46,214 --> 01:04:48,273
I thought I was gonna
have to fire your ass.

743
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:49,840
Seriously.
I think we might be...

744
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:52,376
losing track of our demographic,
so I'm gonna check the reports.

745
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,445
- I'll get back to you.
- Ok, you do that, Coles.

746
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:57,822
You get back to us.
We believe in you, champ!

747
01:05:09,137 --> 01:05:11,571
- Theadora's. Good afternoon.
- Thea.

748
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:12,698
Come on.

749
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:13,833
- Coles.
- Shut up.

750
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,809
I said one drink.
You're so bad.

751
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:17,334
Just a little bit.

752
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,849
- So I'm a little bad.
- Yes.

753
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:24,283
So, what happened
with the blond?

754
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,810
The shit turned green.

755
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:32,423
I love Sam.

756
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:35,194
I know.

757
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:41,527
I mean, I love Claire,
but I'm still in love with Sam.

758
01:05:43,872 --> 01:05:46,864
You think that's stupid
after all these years?

759
01:05:48,443 --> 01:05:49,774
No.

760
01:05:51,479 --> 01:05:53,845
Did she tell you what happened?

761
01:05:57,152 --> 01:05:58,346
Oh, man.

762
01:05:58,386 --> 01:06:00,183
Did you tell Claire about it?

763
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:04,214
There's no room for honesty
in a healthy relationship.

764
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:10,495
You guys still want to go
to the beach this weekend?

765
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,441
What's goin' on, Coles?

766
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:34,918
What do you mean?

767
01:06:34,956 --> 01:06:37,151
I mean,
what's going on with Sam?

768
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:50,266
Those guys are picking us up
in less than an hour...

769
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:52,296
and if you're gonna
act like this all weekend...

770
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,570
maybe we should just
tell 'em we can't go.

771
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:56,008
I'm not acting like anything.

772
01:06:56,044 --> 01:06:59,275
I'm just asking you
to talk to me. Coles?

773
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:06,514
Coles, tell me what's going on.

774
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:08,454
I can take it.

775
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:21,465
There's nothin' to tell.

776
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:30,139
Do you want me to call them?

777
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:33,545
Because maybe this is
a really bad idea.

778
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,150
No, I want to go.

779
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:39,745
I think this is
a really good idea.

780
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:43,988
I'm sorry.

781
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:59,033
What are you doing?

782
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:01,406
You know what I'm thinking?

783
01:08:05,246 --> 01:08:06,907
Thinking? You?

784
01:08:22,597 --> 01:08:24,428
My God!

785
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:25,797
What do you think?

786
01:08:28,303 --> 01:08:32,467
Thea, something's come up, and
I don't think I'll be able...

787
01:08:32,507 --> 01:08:35,943
to make it out there this
weekend, but you all have fun...

788
01:08:35,977 --> 01:08:39,037
and I'll call you
when I get a chance.

789
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,048
That's a shame.

790
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,812
Hope everything's all right.

791
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:45,080
What?

792
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,281
This is spectacular.

793
01:08:52,694 --> 01:08:54,992
I'm sorry.

794
01:08:55,029 --> 01:08:58,021
Let's just try
to have a nice time, Ok?

795
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:01,128
Ok.

796
01:09:04,272 --> 01:09:07,673
So, who do you gotta fuck
to get a place like this?

797
01:09:16,084 --> 01:09:17,415
Gotta get him.

798
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:23,757
I was one of those
pathetic guys...

799
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,316
cryin' in his beer after work,
making lists of reasons...

800
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:28,625
why I could never own
my own place.

801
01:09:28,663 --> 01:09:30,631
Honey, you weren't that bad.

802
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:35,762
I was a loser
until you walked into my life.

803
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:37,134
Shut up.

804
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:40,107
Until you showed up
and started crackin' that whip.

805
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:43,907
No, I just did paperwork,
managerial stuff.

806
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:46,140
But ultimately...

807
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:49,514
it was all his idea.
It was his big dream.

808
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:51,143
She basically gave me
so much shit...

809
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:53,381
that finally
I got my shit together.

810
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:56,356
No, I couldn't have
done it without her.

811
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:58,086
That's true.

812
01:09:58,126 --> 01:09:59,320
I know.

813
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,794
Well, he did name
a restaurant after you.

814
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:07,164
Thank you.

815
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:09,193
He did.

816
01:10:15,677 --> 01:10:17,406
The five years we have had

817
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:20,414
Have been such good times

818
01:10:20,448 --> 01:10:22,348
I still love you

819
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:25,852
Now I think it's time

820
01:10:25,887 --> 01:10:28,014
I lived my life on my own

821
01:10:28,056 --> 01:10:32,152
I guess it's just
what I must do

822
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:34,093
Don't...

823
01:10:36,197 --> 01:10:37,926
You know I can't believe it

824
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:39,695
When you say
that you won't see me

825
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:41,224
Bullshit! This is bullshit!

826
01:10:44,806 --> 01:10:46,330
You know I don't believe you

827
01:10:46,374 --> 01:10:48,672
When you say
that you don't need me

828
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,405
It's not too late to find

829
01:10:50,445 --> 01:10:52,504
You think
you've changed your mind

830
01:10:52,547 --> 01:10:56,745
You'd better change it back
or you will both be sorry

831
01:10:56,784 --> 01:11:00,584
Don't you want me, baby?

832
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:09,920
Were you drunk tonight?

833
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:16,200
No, I just had a few drinks.
Why do you ask?

834
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:18,228
I didn't think you were...

835
01:11:18,273 --> 01:11:20,935
but you seemed
a little out of hand.

836
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:25,102
What do you mean, out of hand?

837
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:28,172
I just mean that it was just
a little weird...

838
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:30,047
the way you were
touching Thea...

839
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:33,019
when you were telling the story
about the bike.

840
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:37,155
When I was touching her arm?

841
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:41,150
Yeah. I mean, not just touching
her arm, you know...

842
01:11:41,195 --> 01:11:45,097
but the way you were
touching it, it was weird.

843
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:47,624
I mean, it made me
uncomfortable...

844
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:52,231
and it seemed like it made her
and Miles uncomfortable, too.

845
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:55,333
You're crazy. I was touching
her arm. I was telling a story.

846
01:11:55,376 --> 01:11:57,401
I would've touched Miles's arm
the same way...

847
01:11:57,445 --> 01:12:02,075
if he'd been
sitting next to me.

848
01:12:02,116 --> 01:12:04,641
I don't know. It just...

849
01:12:04,686 --> 01:12:07,280
It seemed weird,
and it seemed like...

850
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:09,654
it made everyone uncomfortable.

851
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:13,457
I was just surprised that
you didn't pick up on it.

852
01:12:13,494 --> 01:12:15,428
Because you're usually
so perceptive...

853
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:19,422
which is why I was wondering
if you were drunk.

854
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:24,336
I mean, you two
did sleep together once.

855
01:12:24,372 --> 01:12:25,703
You know?

856
01:12:31,579 --> 01:12:33,513
You know what?

857
01:12:33,548 --> 01:12:35,379
I'm sure it was nothing.

858
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:40,353
I'm sure that they probably just
thought you were a little drunk.

859
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:41,719
Good night.

860
01:13:21,863 --> 01:13:23,194
You see, that's the thing.

861
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:25,199
Just as we're beginning to have
a really nice time together...

862
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:28,669
she's gotta make me feel bad
and play on my insecurities.

863
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:31,672
She's just saying it because
she cares about you.

864
01:13:31,706 --> 01:13:32,934
I don't know.

865
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:36,600
I really like Claire.

866
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:38,111
I think she's cool.

867
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:41,078
I don't think so.

868
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:45,649
What?

869
01:13:45,686 --> 01:13:47,677
Are you thinkin'
about Sam again?

870
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,420
Why does it all have
to be so complicated?

871
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:05,835
I have to tell Claire
that I'm in love with Sam.

872
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:08,535
Otherwise,
I'm not being fair to her.

873
01:14:08,576 --> 01:14:11,511
Yeah, I think
you should tell Claire.

874
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:15,482
But don't pretend
you're doing it for her sake...

875
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,507
because you're not.

876
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:51,450
They're probably at the beach
or something.

877
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:55,286
Right. Why don't you stay here?

878
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:57,655
Ok. Meet me back here?

879
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:05,529
Bye, sweetie.

880
01:15:17,345 --> 01:15:19,745
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.

881
01:15:21,582 --> 01:15:23,243
Yeah, baby!

882
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:42,165
I love this song.

883
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:44,637
It reminds me of college.

884
01:16:00,755 --> 01:16:01,983
You Ok there, boss?

885
01:16:02,023 --> 01:16:04,719
Yeah, I'm good.
I'll be in a minute.

886
01:16:11,966 --> 01:16:13,524
I'll be right back.

887
01:16:13,568 --> 01:16:18,665
He's always flippin'.

888
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:20,196
Sam?

889
01:16:23,244 --> 01:16:25,940
You're not gonna believe
what I just did.

890
01:16:39,226 --> 01:16:40,352
What?!

891
01:16:40,394 --> 01:16:42,555
Yeah. You see? It's true.

892
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:43,859
Oh, my God!

893
01:16:43,898 --> 01:16:45,456
Sam.

894
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:48,931
Sam just got married.

895
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,302
She and Jonathan went to Vegas
and got married.

896
01:16:51,339 --> 01:16:53,136
God and Elvis. That's awesome.

897
01:16:53,174 --> 01:16:55,870
After the conversation that
Coles and I had last week...

898
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:58,174
I just realized
that I was being silly.

899
01:16:58,212 --> 01:17:00,737
And so, when Jonathan showed up
and suggested it...

900
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:03,147
I just thought,
"What the hell? Why not?"

901
01:17:03,184 --> 01:17:06,210
So we eloped and went to Vegas.

902
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:08,050
Where's the lucky man?

903
01:17:08,089 --> 01:17:11,991
He's checking into a hotel
and coming back.

904
01:17:12,026 --> 01:17:13,789
We were going to stay
the whole weekend...

905
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:15,853
but we changed our minds.
I don't know.

906
01:17:15,896 --> 01:17:17,659
There was something
about eloping to Vegas...

907
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:19,666
that was kind of
exciting and wild...

908
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,362
and after the ceremony,
when we went back to our room...

909
01:17:22,403 --> 01:17:25,236
it just seemed a little
cheap and depressing...

910
01:17:25,272 --> 01:17:28,833
so I thought I would rather
be here with my friends.

911
01:17:28,876 --> 01:17:31,208
I can't wait
for you to meet him.

912
01:17:34,782 --> 01:17:36,875
I'm so happy for you!

913
01:17:40,788 --> 01:17:44,417
Well, congratulations.
We should celebrate.

914
01:17:47,828 --> 01:17:49,125
Why?

915
01:17:49,163 --> 01:17:51,461
Because I love you.

916
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:53,558
Why now?

917
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:55,364
Why not?

918
01:17:57,371 --> 01:18:01,273
I just feel a little like
a consolation prize, I guess.

919
01:18:01,308 --> 01:18:02,707
What are you talking about?

920
01:18:02,743 --> 01:18:05,177
It's not like we haven't
talked about it before.

921
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:07,544
Exactly. You were never ready.

922
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:11,449
It just seems sudden.

923
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:14,113
- Sudden's romantic.
- This is not romantic.

924
01:18:14,155 --> 01:18:17,318
Sure it is. We got beach.
What more do you want?

925
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:22,059
I'm gonna tell you
something, Ok?

926
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:27,267
And as I do, I need you
to do something for me.

927
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:31,533
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't interrupt me.

928
01:18:31,572 --> 01:18:33,870
Because I don't want you
to throw me off, Ok?

929
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:35,205
- You promise?
- I promise.

930
01:18:35,242 --> 01:18:36,641
But is all this
really necessary?

931
01:18:36,677 --> 01:18:40,078
Shut up and listen to me.
I know you fucked Sam last week.

932
01:18:40,114 --> 01:18:42,878
What are you talking about?

933
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,214
Shut your mouth.

934
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:47,584
- Claire...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

935
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:57,261
Now I'm gonna tell you
what happened.

936
01:18:58,532 --> 01:19:02,491
And then I'm gonna tell you
how I feel about it...

937
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:06,028
and you are just gonna
sit there and listen, Ok?

938
01:19:07,942 --> 01:19:12,140
Now, last week
I got a call from Kim's...

939
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:15,239
that your tapes had arrived.

940
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:17,250
So I was really excited...

941
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:21,880
and I was gonna get home early
and surprise you.

942
01:19:21,922 --> 01:19:24,254
But you were already there.

943
01:20:15,576 --> 01:20:18,136
I know it sounds crazy...

944
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:20,170
but I felt relief.

945
01:20:25,252 --> 01:20:28,881
For years I've wanted
to start our family...

946
01:20:28,923 --> 01:20:31,915
and you've never known
what you want.

947
01:21:07,394 --> 01:21:09,259
I was standing
in the hallway...

948
01:21:09,296 --> 01:21:13,096
throwing your tapes
down the incinerator...

949
01:21:13,133 --> 01:21:16,000
when I suddenly realized
it was like a blessing.

950
01:21:16,036 --> 01:21:19,995
Finally, you were making
a decision about what you want.

951
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,008
So, I turned around...

952
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:26,206
and I walked back into
the apartment, ready to face it.

953
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:29,440
But I missed it.

954
01:21:31,752 --> 01:21:33,811
I thought that if I waited...

955
01:21:33,854 --> 01:21:36,414
you would have
to make a decision.

956
01:21:36,457 --> 01:21:38,118
So I waited.

957
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:52,069
But you are such
a fucking pussy, Coles.

958
01:21:52,106 --> 01:21:54,267
You wouldn't even
give me that.

959
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:57,869
You fucked Sam, and you still
didn't make a decision.

960
01:21:57,912 --> 01:21:59,106
Sam did.

961
01:21:59,146 --> 01:22:02,274
It's like you robbed me of the
one thing I was hoping to get...

962
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:04,944
out of this whole
fucked up mess.

963
01:22:09,356 --> 01:22:11,688
You still haven't chosen me.

964
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:17,963
You're, like, settling for me.

965
01:22:19,934 --> 01:22:21,561
Claire.

966
01:22:21,602 --> 01:22:22,933
Don't...

967
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:30,700
Not a fuckin' word out of you.

968
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:41,377
So, that's where I'm at.

969
01:22:42,489 --> 01:22:47,927
And this is what
you're gonna do.

970
01:22:47,962 --> 01:22:51,398
You are not gonna
apologize to me...

971
01:22:51,432 --> 01:22:52,956
because that's
like an admission...

972
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,991
and even though
I saw it happen...

973
01:22:55,035 --> 01:22:57,196
I don't ever want
to hear you admit to it.

974
01:22:57,237 --> 01:22:59,467
So, you're just
gonna say nothing.

975
01:22:59,506 --> 01:23:02,942
I know that you're sorry.

976
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:05,070
And in your spineless,
pathetic way...

977
01:23:05,112 --> 01:23:07,273
that's as much
as you can give me.

978
01:23:14,254 --> 01:23:16,654
I just have to decide
if I can live with it.

979
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:19,552
I love you, Claire.

980
01:23:23,063 --> 01:23:25,623
And I want us to be together.

981
01:23:31,538 --> 01:23:34,439
I guess I'm gonna
have to think about it.

982
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:39,201
You want me
to fall on my knees?

983
01:23:40,714 --> 01:23:42,545
Fuck you, Coles.

984
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:46,178
What do you want me to do?
I'm on my knees.

985
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,721
Claire.

986
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:30,122
- All right.
- Which bag is it in?

987
01:24:30,164 --> 01:24:32,064
The garment bag.
You don't need to change...

988
01:24:32,099 --> 01:24:34,567
into other clothes.
You look good.

989
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:37,229
Jonathan, this is Coles.

990
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:39,933
Hi. It's a pleasure.

991
01:24:39,973 --> 01:24:42,237
Likewise.

992
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:50,441
Well, let's go inside.

993
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:52,509
That kind of takes the fun out
of going to Vegas, doesn't it?

994
01:24:52,553 --> 01:24:55,386
That's what I thought,
but Jonathan thought...

995
01:24:55,422 --> 01:24:57,947
the whole Vegas aesthetic
was a little tacky.

996
01:24:57,991 --> 01:25:00,186
I liked the idea at first.
It seemed fun...

997
01:25:00,227 --> 01:25:03,924
but when it came down to it,
it just felt inappropriate.

998
01:25:03,964 --> 01:25:06,865
I guess I'm just old-fashioned.

999
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,893
Even so, the chapel,
it was all pink and red.

1000
01:25:34,228 --> 01:25:35,889
So, what about you two?

1001
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:39,330
Sam says you've been together
for five years.

1002
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:42,335
Isn't that when they put
the screws to you?

1003
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:50,601
We'll see.

1004
01:25:52,012 --> 01:25:55,072
I'd like to thank both of you
for a truly wonderful weekend.

1005
01:25:55,115 --> 01:25:57,174
Our pleasure.

1006
01:25:57,217 --> 01:25:59,685
And I'd like
to propose a toast.

1007
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:04,282
This is to Sam and Jonathan.

1008
01:26:04,324 --> 01:26:09,819
To a happy, healthy marriage
and a beautiful life together.

1009
01:26:09,863 --> 01:26:11,194
Thank you so much.

1010
01:26:11,231 --> 01:26:12,459
Thank you.

1011
01:26:12,499 --> 01:26:14,330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1012
01:26:14,368 --> 01:26:15,699
Cheers.

1013
