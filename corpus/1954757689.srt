1
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,304
A-ha!

2
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,469
Eh?

3
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,206
"Booby Traps"?

4
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,586
Ah...

5
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:12,598
Oh, there you are,
my lovely.

6
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,278
Hmm! What's that?

7
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,514
Take the book?

8
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:29,756
I don't mind if I do.

9
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,787
At last, it is mine.

10
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,357
Finally, you are mine.

11
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,767
All right. Let's do this.
Bare knuckles.

12
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,209
Bring it on, skinny.
You don't scare me.

13
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,645
You got any sevens?

14
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,413
Go fish.

15
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,385
Is that all you got?

16
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,758
Ooh.

17
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,514
Hmm.

18
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,716
Man, this is way overdue.

19
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,822
"Once upon a time,
under the sea,

20
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,292
"there was a little town
called Bikini Bottom.

21
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,827
<i>"In this town,
there was a place</i>

22
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,796
<i>"called The Krusty Krab,</i>

23
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,598
<i>"where folks would
come to eat a thing</i>

24
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,866
<i>"called the Krabby Patty.</i>

25
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,436
<i>"Every greasy spoon

26
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,271
<i>"and the one who worked here</i>

27
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:02,374
<i>"was named

<i>¶ Who lives

<i>¶ SpongeBob SquarePants!</i>

30
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,781
Just hold it. Hold it.
<i>¶ Absorbent and yellow</i>

31
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,783
<i>¶ SpongeBob SquarePants!</i>

<i>¶ Then drop on the deck

<i>¶ SpongeBob SquarePants! ¶</i>

36
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,393
Stop!

37
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,330
Huh?

38
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,698
There's only one thing worse

39
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
than talking birds,
and that would be...

40
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,136
Singing birds!

41
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,571
Okay, I promise not to
<i>¶ si-i-i-ng. ¶</i>

42
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,575
Take it from us.

43
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,011
He really does hate
singing birds.

44
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,882
Just keep weading.
Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.

45
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,718
Come closer
while I tell you the tale.

46
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,321
Okay, start reading.
No. Not that close!

47
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,323
Yeah. Hmm.

48
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,025
All right, here we go.

49
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,330
Now, SpongeBob
loved his job

50
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,065
<i>as a fry cook...</i>

51
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,034
<i>...more than anything.</i>

52
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:04,736
<i>And that is saying a lot</i>

53
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,472
<i>because he loved everything!</i>

54
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,708
<i>He loved his pet snail, Gary.</i>

55
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,543
<i>He loved
his best friend, Patrick.</i>

56
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,347
<i>He loved blowing bubbles</i>

57
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,917
<i>and jellyfishing.</i>
Whee!

58
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,786
<i>He loved making
Krabby Patties</i>

59
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,854
<i>for the folks of
Bikini Bottom</i>

60
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,557
<i>just as much
as they loved eating them.</i>

61
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,976
<i>Why, you may ask,</i>

62
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,394
<i>do they love this</i>
<i>greasy little sandwich</i>
<i>so much?</i>

63
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,597
<i>Why did they eat them
for breakfast...</i>

64
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,679
<i>...lunch,</i>

65
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,401
<i>and dinner,</i>

66
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,904
<i>despite their
doctor's warnings?</i>

67
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,539
He'll be gone in a week.

68
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,741
Oh, Harold!

69
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,479
<i>Oh. It was a secret.</i>

70
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,448
<i>No one was sure what was</i>

71
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,950
<i>in these patties
that made them so delicious.</i>

72
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,719
<i>And, frankly,
no one cared,</i>

73
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,754
<i>except for Plankton.</i>
Meh.

74
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,023
<i>Plankton owned a restaurant
right across the street</i>

75
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,458
<i>from The Krusty Krab,</i>

76
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,926
<i>where no one ate</i>

77
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,728
<i>because the food
was really bad.</i>

78
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,011
Now, is that
really necessary?

79
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,966
<i>Plankton
had made it his life's work</i>

80
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,468
<i>to steal the recipe.</i>

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,937
SpongeBob, please,
let's talk about this!

82
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,675
<i>And SpongeBob was
always there to protect it.</i>

83
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,810
<i>But today, things</i>

84
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,414
<i>would be different.</i>

85
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,851
Good morning, SpongeBob!

86
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,085
Morning, Patrick!

87
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,920
You here for
your pre-lunch
Krabby Patty?

88
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,689
I'm getting two today.

89
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,959
One for me
and one for my friend.

90
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,894
Oh. Have I met this friend?

91
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,896
"You know me, SpongeBob."

92
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,134
Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.

93
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,979
Thirteen,

94
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,415
fourteen, fifteen...

95
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,783
Hey, Mr. Krabs,
I thought we got

96
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,651
our tartar sauce delivery
on Thursday.

97
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,813
Tartar...

98
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,954
Sauce?

99
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,723
Bull's-eye!

100
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,161
Plankton!

101
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:12,097
So it's a food fight
he wants, eh?

102
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,732
Welcome to Air Plankton.

103
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,168
Please put your seat backs
and tray tables up

104
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,937
as we're now approaching
our final destination.

105
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,076
Okay, Patrick,
load the potatoes!

106
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,845
Mashed or scalloped, sir?

107
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,747
No, Patrick. Raw.

108
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,781
Sir, yes, sir!

109
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,718
Locked and loaded!

110
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,888
Don't worry, little formuler,
you'll be safe in this,

111
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,223
uh, safe.

112
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,059
Fire!

113
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,064
Potatoes?

114
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,935
He's closing in!

115
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,804
I think we have a few minutes
before he gets here.

116
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,222
He's right
on top of us!

117
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,181
Hey, it's raining fries!

118
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,543
It's gonna take
a lot more than potatoes
to bring this baby down.

119
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,522
Or maybe not.

120
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,795
Whoo!

121
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,877
Wait a minute,
Patrick, look!
He's got a tank!

122
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,206
Well, Krabs, you're certainly
in a pickle now!

123
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,753
Hey, it's raining pickles!

124
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,222
Now it's raining...

125
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,158
Tanks.

126
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,660
You're welcome!

127
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,964
Finland.

128
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,671
Your orders, sir!

129
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,307
I'll have two
Krabby Patties-extra ketchup,

130
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,709
extra mustard,
and hold the mayo.

131
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,977
Wrong channel!

132
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,646
Your orders, sir!

133
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:11,082
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
Hold the mayo!

134
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,317
Yes, sir!

135
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,086
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!

136
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,290
Hold the mayo!

137
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,992
Unleash the condiments!

138
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,861
With relish.

139
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,705
Excuse me.

140
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,814
Hello?

141
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,449
Hello?

142
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,083
<i>Guess y'all</i>
<i>don't want my money.</i>
Money?

143
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,752
Thank you! Come again!

144
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,262
I can't hold the mayo
any longer!

145
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:06,204
Mayo? Well, it's going to
take a lot more than mayo
to stop...

146
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,611
Now what?

147
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,788
Oh!

148
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,091
I just remembered,
I don't work for Mr. Krabs!

149
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,227
Robot! Robot!

150
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,696
Robot! Giant robot!

151
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,965
Robot! Robot!

152
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,268
Mr. Krabs, Plankton's here
and he's got a giant robot!

153
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,670
Quick, boy, bar the door!

154
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,005
Got it!

155
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,651
I'll take
one secret formula...

156
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,253
...to go.

157
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,299
Oh, barnacles.
I'm out of gas?

158
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,304
I'm not through yet.

159
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:17,042
I've got something
that will make you
hand over that formula.

160
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,344
Something you can't resist.

161
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,447
Money!

162
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,349
Yes! Huh?

163
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,185
That's... That's...
That's impossible!

164
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,089
Well, it was full of money
just last week.

165
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,192
And then
I bought that airplane
and built that tank.

166
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,727
Sounds to me like

167
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,197
someone's just
a wee bit broke!

168
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,268
Well, Krabs,
I guess you've won.

169
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,136
I've spent every penny
I've ever made

170
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,098
trying to put you
out of business.

171
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:52,143
Except this one.
My last penny.

172
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,046
Besides, what can I do
with one measly cent anyway?

173
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,981
You could give it to me.
Just a suggestion.

174
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,850
Here, take it.

175
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,757
You've taken everything else.
Why not?

176
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,296
Well, Plankton,
like a reheated Krabby Patty,

177
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,798
you've been foiled again.

178
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,736
I guess this means
the secret formula

179
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,738
is safe forever,
right, Mr. Krabs?

180
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,106
It sure does, boy.

181
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,075
Why don't you scurry along?

182
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,480
Thanks for coming!
Have a nice day!

183
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,953
He's been out there
crying for 20 minutes.

184
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,955
Pathetic.

185
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,717
I'm just going to
go out there
and gloat a little.

186
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:54,172
Cyclops to Laptop.
Come in, Laptop.

187
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,475
<i>"Laptop." You do realize
that nickname is demeaning?</i>

188
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,545
<i>I have twice the processing
power of a laptop.</i>

189
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,181
Never mind.
Maintain radio silence.

190
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,920
Finally!

191
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:09,922
Huh?

192
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,793
A pressure plate, eh, Krabs?

193
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,161
Amateur hour.

194
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,864
Hmm.

195
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,001
Perfect!

196
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,906
Not a bad likeness.

197
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,308
Good enough to fool
that idiot Krabs.

198
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,443
Easy, easy.

199
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,816
Plankton's broke!
Ooh-ooh.

200
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,484
Look at Mr. Krabs go.

201
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,319
I've never seen him
gloat this hard before.

202
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,923
Hey, well, Plankton,

203
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,293
me bunions are telling me
it's time to stop gloating.

204
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,930
Huh? Looks like you're
falling apart at the seams.

205
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,501
Huh?
Poor me.

206
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,970
Sob, sob.
A robot?

207
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,673
Plankton?

208
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,374
Uh-oh.

209
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,979
That ain't good.

210
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,581
<i>Initiating lockdown sequence.</i>

211
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,049
Me formuler!

212
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,487
Huh? Ow!

213
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,327
No, no, no! No!

214
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,295
Squidward! Open up!

215
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:27,298
Ha-ha, victory dance.
Boo-ya.

216
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,600
Give me that!

217
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,603
Come on, SpongeBob, join me!

218
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,072
And we'll be rich
and powerful,

219
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,540
until I eventually
betray you.

220
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,244
Uh, join me!
No! Never!

221
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,179
I'm on Team Krabs for life!

222
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,552
Plankton!

223
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,297
What? Where'd it go?

224
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,532
<i>Wait a minute.
Molecular deconstruction?</i>

225
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,669
<i>I proved that</i>
<i>to be a scientific</i>
<i>impossibility seven times!</i>

226
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,905
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

227
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,173
<i>I think I forgot to empty
Gary's litter box today.</i>

228
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,579
Where's me formuler,
Plankton?

229
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,282
I... I don't know!
It just disappeared!

230
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,484
Why should I believe you,
you lying liar?

231
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,386
Normally, I'd agree
with you, Mr. Krabs,

232
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,688
but this time he's telling
the truth. It just vanished!

233
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,323
It's true!

234
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,996
Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you
he's innocent!

235
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,398
What are you
going to do, Krabs?

236
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,066
Pour hot oil on me?

237
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,201
Or put bamboo shoots
under my nails?

238
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:41,005
No. Knock, knock.

239
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:44,542
Knock-knock jokes?
I can do this all day, Krabs.

240
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,144
Knock, knock.

241
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,212
Oh, boy. Who's there?

242
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,447
Jimmy.

243
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,949
Jimmy who?

244
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,952
Jimmy back my formuler,
Plankton!

245
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,156
Well, that's stupid,
but how is it torture?

246
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,192
You'll see.

247
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,295
"Jimmy back my formula"?

248
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,230
Hmm.

249
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,466
Oh!

250
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,101
I get it!

251
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,546
Oh, make it stop, Krabs!
Make it stop!

252
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,158
Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob, zip it!

253
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,229
Thank you, Squidward.

254
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,231
The customers
are getting restless!

255
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,532
They're asking for

256
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,135
refunds.

257
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,204
Refunds.

258
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,073
Refunds?

259
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,209
Refund! Refund!

260
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,344
Listen up, boy.
Get in there

261
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,713
and make me customers
some Krabby Patties!

262
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,749
All right, Plankton... Huh?

263
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,055
SpongeBob!
What's wrong, boy?

264
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,094
We're out of Krabby Patties?

265
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:14,265
How can we make
more Krabby Patties
without the secret formula?

266
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,567
You've got to have that
formuler memorized by now!

267
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,136
But as you are aware, sir,

268
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,371
the employee handbook
clearly states, and I quote,

269
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,739
"No employee may,
in part or in whole,

270
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,241
"commit the Krabby Patty
secret formula

271
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,642
"to any recorded written
or visual form,

272
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,477
"including memories, dreams,
and/or needlepoint."

273
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:30,214
Curse you,
fine print!

274
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,583
Refund! Refund! Refund!

275
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,118
Stop!

276
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,056
I'm not your enemy!

277
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,124
Plankton is your enemy!

278
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,493
So is he an anemone
or a plankton?

279
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,197
Well, someone had to do it.

280
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,398
But Mr. Krabs...

281
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,801
He took this from you!

282
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:53,071
Krabby Patty...
I can almost taste it.

283
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,473
Uh, Mr. Krabs,
Plankton didn't take
the secret formula.

284
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,375
Not now, SpongeBob!

285
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,678
Hey! I ordered
a double Krabby Patty!

286
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,182
So join me! Help get
the formuler back,

287
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:08,186
and I'll give each
and every one of you
a free Krabby Patty!

288
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,389
Oh, no! Wait!

289
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,425
Even better,
a slight discount!

290
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,730
To The Chum Bucket!

291
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,500
But he didn't do it.

292
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,103
I had it right
in my greedy little mitts,

293
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,804
and then... Poof!

294
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,640
And now it's gone.
Gone forever.

295
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,810
Oh, I was so close to
gaining the people's
respect-slash-fear.

296
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,579
<i>Um, Plankton?</i>

297
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:38,282
Oh, when will my
frustration-slash-humiliation
end?

298
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,351
<i>Plankton?</i>
Not now, hon!

299
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,120
I'm ranting-slash-raving.

300
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,673
All right, what is it?

301
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:48,558
<i>Well, I was</i>
<i>trying to tell you there's</i>
<i>an angry mob outside.</i>

302
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,828
<i>But now they're inside.</i>

303
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,164
Oh.

304
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,466
Hmm?
<i>I just work here.</i>

305
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,635
We'd like to have
a word with you!

306
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,373
You all look very hungry.

307
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,342
Can I get anybody
a Chum Burger?

308
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,244
Enough with
the niceties, Plankton!

309
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,813
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

310
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,249
Where is me formuler?

311
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,752
I told you, Krabs,
I don't have it.

312
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,654
Wrong answer.

313
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,856
Stop!

314
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,159
All right, Mr. Krabs,
let me get in on this.

315
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,531
What's going on around here?

316
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,499
You may want to
step back a little,
Mr. Krabs.

317
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,634
This could get messy.

318
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,335
Let's hope so.

319
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,638
So you won't talk,
eh, Plankton?

320
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,873
I didn't want to
have to do this.

321
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,910
Plankton,
here comes the pain.

322
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:42,413
Soap in the eye, eh?
Diabolical!

323
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,350
No! Stop! Don't!

324
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,486
Wait.
That didn't look painful.

325
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:52,390
Mr. Krabs,
you may not understand
what I'm about to do today,

326
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:56,327
but someday we'll look back
and have a good laugh.

327
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,262
Wait a minute.

328
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,565
Hey, they're getting away!

329
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,400
Sorry, Mr. Krabs!

330
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:06,904
So, you've been running
a long con on me, eh?

331
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,974
All these years you've been
working for Plankton!

332
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,642
They're in cahoots!

333
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,711
Yeah, I guess that's
a short way of saying it.

334
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,513
Stop that bubble!

335
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,759
Please tell me there's
something soft below me.

336
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,927
Mmm, nope.

337
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,265
SpongeBob!

338
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:38,302
Oh. You were like
an underpaid son to me.

339
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,439
I would've expected Squidward
to stab me in the back.

340
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,540
Huh? What? Huh?

341
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,193
But SpongeBob?

342
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:47,845
Me most trusted employee?
Working with me sworn enemy?

343
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,848
You know what this means,
Mr. Squidward.

344
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,949
We get the rest
of the day off?

345
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,402
No!

346
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,854
This be but a harbinger
of what I fear lies ahead.

347
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,823
For you. For me.

348
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,558
For all of Bikini Bottom!

349
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,294
The Krabby Patty
is what ties us all together!

350
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:07,832
Without it, there will be
a complete breakdown
of social order.

351
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,735
A war of all against all!

352
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,738
Dark times are ahead.

353
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,340
Dark times indeed!

354
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,909
Seriously?

355
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,986
Aren't you
overreacting a bit?

356
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,348
Huh?

357
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,385
Welcome to the apocalypse,
Mr. Squidward.

358
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,467
I hope you like leather.

359
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,856
I prefer suede.

360
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:39,463
And so
Bikini Bottom became

361
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,301
an apocalyptic cesspool
forevermore.

362
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,935
The end.

363
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,608
Wait a minute.
That's a terrible ending.

364
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,910
Oh, this is bad.
Really bad.
What? What?

365
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,079
SpongeBob's in trouble
and the story's over?

366
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,348
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

367
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,883
Hey, call a therapist!

368
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,685
I have anxiety!

369
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,690
There is no way that
that's the end of this story.

370
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,626
Of course it is.
I'll show you.

371
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:09,760
Just turn around.

372
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,095
Oh, all right.

373
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,397
Hey!

374
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,366
I need that to fly, you jerk.

375
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,069
"The

376
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,905
"End"!

377
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,809
<i>That's not the end!</i>

378
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,110
Of course it is!

379
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,012
Unhand that book!
You let go of that!

380
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,847
Let go, you numbskull!

381
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,085
You better keep reading,
Mr. Pirate,

382
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,521
or else!

383
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,492
I know
I shouldn't be littering,
but that ending was rubbish!

384
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,830
Rubbish!

385
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,842
Good morning, Squidward.
I'll have the usual.

386
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,847
With cheese.

387
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,849
We're out of Krabby Patties
right now!

388
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,451
No Krabby Patties?

389
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,054
No!

390
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,592
Look what's become
of Bikini Bottom.

391
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:17,094
We've really gotta
get that formula back.

392
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,798
Hmm. Get the secret formula,
you say?

393
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,001
Excuse me, I need a moment.

394
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,638
With that formula,
I could rule the world!

395
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,077
You know I can
hear you, right?

396
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,579
Well, what do we do now?

397
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,582
Now we work together.
You know, teamwork.

398
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,785
What's, uh, "tee-am work"?

399
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,086
No, Plankton, teamwork.

400
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:43,954
Tee-am work.

401
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,122
Teamwork.
Tie-'em work.

402
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,490
Teamwork.
Tie 'em up!

403
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,893
Say "team,"
like a sports...
Team.

404
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,661
Team. Now say "work."
Work.

405
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,862
Put them together.
What do you got?

406
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,664
Time bomb work.

407
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,666
Getting better!

408
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:00,538
<i>Now, Bikini Bottom
Action News!</i>

409
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,676
Oh, hey, Patrick!

410
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,913
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!

411
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,051
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby...

412
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,053
Krabby Patty, Krabby...

413
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,788
Krabby Patty...

414
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,056
Krabby...

415
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,760
Krabby!

416
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,528
Come on, tummy,

417
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,931
it's gonna be a long day.

418
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,166
<i>We interrupt
your regular program</i>

419
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,801
<i>for an important
news bulletin.</i>

420
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,503
Perch Perkins reporting live

421
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,005
from downtown
Bikini Bottom.

422
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:38,476
Complete chaos here today
as our town
attempts to deal with

423
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,646
a sudden and complete shortage
of Krabby Patties. Whoa!

424
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,982
Events here have
this reporter wondering,

425
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,486
what is the secret ingredient
in Krabby Patties anyway?

426
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:52,623
It's love!
The secret ingredient is love!

427
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,160
No more
Krabby Patties?

428
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,528
If I'd have known that,

429
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,897
I'd have chewed it slower.
Huh?

430
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,601
What the corndog is that?

431
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,574
Come on, Plankton,
it's easy!

432
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,576
It means, I help you,
you help me,

433
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,144
and when
we accomplish our goal,

434
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,513
then we do
hands in the middle.

435
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,582
Hands in the middle?
No, no. Sounds idiotic.

436
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:23,053
Besides, the two of us
are no match for
that cranky mob!

437
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,992
We could probably
use a few more

438
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,760
tee-am works.

439
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,095
That's exactly
what I was thinking!

440
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,097
Wait, what are you doing?

441
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,234
I

442
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,570
Need Krabby Patties!

443
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,839
Patrick, what are you doing?

444
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,140
Krabby Patties!

445
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,808
Vandalizing stuff.

446
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,544
Isn't that your house?

447
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,112
Hey, what's with
all the questions?

448
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,780
Who are you guys?

449
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,283
It's me, your best friend!
SpongeBob?

450
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:55,553
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you're SpongeBob,

451
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,688
then what's
the secret password?

452
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,256
Uh...

453
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,325
Correct! It is you!

454
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,661
SpongeBob!
Whoa!

455
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,329
SpongeBob.
Patrick!

456
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,331
SpongeBob!

457
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,968
Why aren't you
at The Krusty Krab
making Krabby Patties?

458
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,671
Well, I'd love to,
but the formula's gone.

459
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,806
Yeah, Mr. Krabs says
you and Plankton took it.

460
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,241
No, that's not
what happened.

461
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,909
It just disappeared.

462
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,978
We're putting
a team together
to find it.

463
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,680
A team?

464
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,015
Oh! Oh! Pick me!
Pick me! Pick me!

465
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,350
Okay, Patrick, you're in.

466
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,952
I don't know, SpongeBob.

467
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:31,322
What exactly does this clown
bring to the tee-am?

468
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:34,058
He brings loyalty, Plankton.

469
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,160
Loyalty.
Isn't that right, Patrick?

470
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,761
Yeah, yeah, loyalty.

471
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,164
I've got SpongeBob!

472
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,933
He's over here!

473
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,773
Let's go get him!

474
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,076
Come on, SpongeBob,
let's get out of here!

475
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,611
Patrick!

476
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,114
Patrick, why are you
doing this?

477
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,683
Because I need

478
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,218
Krabby Patties!

479
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,287
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

480
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,756
Over here!

481
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,833
Guys, am I still
on the team?

482
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,075
Hey, what are you
looking at?

483
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,742
Sandy!

484
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,113
Sandy!

485
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Sandy?

486
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,723
Sandy, are you home?

487
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,992
Gee, Plankton,
I wonder where she is.

488
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,994
What is all this stuff?

489
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,196
Sandy?

490
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,486
Don't touch that!

491
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:53,170
Incoherent muttering.

492
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,205
Sandy? Are you okay?

493
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,041
Okay?

494
00:27:57,043 --> 00:28:01,845
Have you looked outside?
Does that seem "okay" to you?

495
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,948
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to society.

496
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,684
If we don't fix it soon,

497
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,406
there won't be
anything left to fix!

498
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,320
Sandy?

499
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,923
The lack of Krabby Patties
has driven her mad.

500
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,125
And I think
I figgered it out.

501
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,293
Look.

502
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:22,032
When this came down
from above,

503
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,302
I knew it could
only mean one thing.

504
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,770
And that would be?

505
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:31,175
It means it's the end!

506
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:35,012
The sandwich gods
are angry with us!

507
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,480
Sandwich gods?

508
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,962
I just don't know
how we're going to
appease them!

509
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,926
You got any other friends

510
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,728
who aren't dim bulbs
or nut jobs?

511
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,298
Well, I have one friend
who's loyal to the very end.

512
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,740
Gary, I'm home.

513
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:04,809
Gare-bear?

514
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:07,946
Gary?

515
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,413
Gary?

516
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,182
Ugh.
Huh?

517
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,517
Revolting!

518
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,252
But it means
Gary is close by!

519
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,287
Gary, I'm back!

520
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:20,224
Whoa.

521
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:26,196
Oh, hey, Gary, Plankton and I
need you to help us find
the Krabby Patty formula

522
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,799
and fix Bikini Bottom.

523
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,368
What do you mean, you don't
have to do as I say anymore?

524
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,471
What do you mean,
"King of Snails"?

525
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,808
Gary The Snail,
you get down here right now
and join this team!

526
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,311
What do you mean,
"Seize them"?

527
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:46,950
Why are you running?

528
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,072
Because they're
right on our tail.

529
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,925
Oh, right, snails.

530
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:58,128
Well, so much
for your tee-am.

531
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,965
Putting together
a team is a lot harder
than I thought it would be!

532
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,917
This way!

533
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:06,278
We better get out of here
until things cool off.

534
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,984
Everything we know
and love has been destroyed.

535
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,003
Oh, yeah, looks like
they're gonna have to

536
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,021
change the name
of Bikini Bottom
to Dirty Bottom.

537
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,225
Right, SpongeBob?

538
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,227
That's kind
of gross, Plankton.

539
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,429
Yeah.
Yeah, too soon, huh?

540
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,366
This feels like
it really is the end.

541
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,837
Don't worry, SpongeBob,

542
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,841
we'll find the secret formula
and everything will go back
to the way it was,

543
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,943
you know,
all happy and junk.

544
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,248
Now let's try
and get some sleep.

545
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,588
Yeah, I guess you're right.

546
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,995
Here you are. Feel comfy?

547
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,496
You know, Plankton,

548
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,498
I think you might know
a little bit more

549
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,301
about teamwork
than you let on.

550
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,003
Good night, SpongeBob.

551
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,172
Good night, Plankton.

552
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,878
"Good night," indeed.

553
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,481
That's right,
SpongeBob, sleep.

554
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,351
You're hiding that formula
in there somewhere.

555
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,419
Huh?

556
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,524
Well, here goes nothing.

557
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,895
Huh?

558
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,202
What is this place?

559
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,307
Fudge fight!

560
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,509
Oh, it's all over me!

561
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,379
Ew! It's so sweet in here!

562
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,048
I think my eyeball
is getting a toothache!

563
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,483
Hello, Plankton.

564
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,118
Come and play with us.

565
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
Hurry

566
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,656
before we melt.

567
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,166
Whoa...

568
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,586
So much sweetness.

569
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,708
I think I'm going
to be sick!

570
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:40,991
Huh?

571
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,027
Daddy!

572
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,001
Uh, Plankton?
Oh, Plankton!

573
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,603
I just had
the craziest dream!
And you were in it!

574
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,845
I'm sure it was nothing.

575
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,141
Now go back to sleep.

576
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,710
Were you in my brain?

577
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:03,046
What? No!
That's crazy talk!

578
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,149
Then why is there
cotton candy
on your antenna?

579
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,019
Because, uh, because, uh...

580
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,121
Okay, fine,
I was in your brain.

581
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,290
What were you
doing in there?

582
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,025
What do you think
I was doing?

583
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,760
Looking for
the secret formula.

584
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,729
What?
Don't act so innocent.

585
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,597
You knew what I was up to.

586
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,033
That's why you're pretending
not to know the formula.

587
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,401
I'm not pretending!

588
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,303
I can't believe
you thought I was lying.

589
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,038
Hey, don't take it
personally.

590
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,673
I just assume
everyone is lying.

591
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,575
That is a horrible way

592
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,377
to live your life.
Whatever.

593
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,380
It is! And if we're going
to be on the same team...

594
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,215
Maybe I don't want to be

595
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,751
on the tee-am!
You think of that?

596
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:43,086
But, Plankton,
everything's better

597
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,322
when you're part of a team.

598
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,025
You're not going
to start singing, are you?

599
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,877
<i>¶ Teamwork!</i>
Oh, brother.

600
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:51,728
<i>¶ We can do anything
when we have teamwork</i>

601
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,630
<i>¶ Don't you think so,
my friend?</i>

602
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,499
<i>¶ No, tee-am work</i>

603
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:58,201
<i>¶ Is getting in the way
of my schee-am work</i>

604
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,670
<i>¶ What don't you comprehend?</i>

605
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,739
<i>¶ But working together
is the key</i>

606
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:07,077
<i>¶ Nothing's impossible
when it's you and me</i>

607
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,279
<i>¶ I'm doing just fine
on my own</i>

608
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,248
<i>¶ Work is no fun
when you do it alone</i>

609
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,617
<i>¶ If I want it done right,
I'll do it by myself</i>

610
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,685
<i>¶ But what if you need
something on a higher shelf?</i>

611
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,554
<i>¶ But I'm the target</i>

612
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,422
<i>¶ Of a very scary,
crazy post-apocalyptic mob!</i>

613
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:21,358
<i>¶ Well, that's exactly
why you need a partner</i>

614
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,694
<i>¶ Helping you
with this important job</i>

615
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,830
<i>¶ I'll be the hammer,
you'll be the nail</i>

616
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,832
<i>¶ I'll be the boat
and you'll be the sail</i>

617
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,168
<i>¶ I'm the flower,
you're the aroma</i>

618
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:35,172
<i>¶ Right now
I wish I was in a coma</i>

619
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:36,790
Come on.

620
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,407
<i>¶ I'm here for you
and you're here for me</i>

621
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,777
<i>¶ It's better when
you plus me equals we</i>

622
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,347
<i>¶ Working together
in harmony</i>

623
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,616
<i>¶ Side by side,
we can reach our dreams</i>

624
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,285
<i>¶ 'Cause nothing's impossible</i>

625
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,787
<i>¶ When we're a team! ¶</i>

626
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,390
All right,
you can put me down.

627
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:54,791
Well...

628
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,127
That's one minute of my life
I'll never get back.

629
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,628
Not without a time machine.

630
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,470
Wait a minute.
Hold that thought.

631
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,334
Now back up.

632
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,170
Slow down.

633
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,706
Not without
a time machine.

634
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,208
Hmm.

635
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,542
Yes!

636
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,847
SpongeBob,
you're a genius!
I am?

637
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,382
If we build a time machine,

638
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:22,152
we can go back to before
the formula disappeared.

639
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:25,689
Before society broke down.
Before we became the hunted!

640
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,390
That sounds great, Plankton,

641
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:30,760
but how do we build
a time machine?

642
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,296
Well, first we'll need
a computer powerful enough

643
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,298
to calculate the intricacies
of time travel.

644
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,420
Where would
we get one of those?

645
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,237
Hmm.

646
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,705
There she is.
My computer wife.

647
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:44,174
They've got her tied up
in the back room.

648
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,176
I've never seen this many
people at The Chum Bucket.

649
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,410
I've never seen
anyone there.

650
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,712
Now was that
really necessary?

651
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,813
Cause the food's really bad.

652
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,681
Oh, come on! Really?
Shh!

653
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,884
How are we gonna
sneak past those guards?

654
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,285
Hmm.

655
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,530
Well, what do we have here?

656
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,470
We better hurry.
Those guys really hate tires.

657
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,611
We'll never get in.
The door's locked.

658
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,613
Hmm.

659
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,283
Wait. The window is open.

660
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:27,801
Come on, Plankton,

661
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:29,318
it's time for some teamwork.
Give me a boost.

662
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:31,188
Okay. Wait a minute, no!

663
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,859
Just a little higher,
Plankton.

664
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,661
Plankton?

665
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:43,400
Why don't you
boost me up instead?

666
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:44,642
Oh, yeah, good thinking.

667
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,911
Come on, SpongeBob, come on!

668
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,282
We're in!

669
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,718
Shh!

670
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,421
There's a guard
over there.

671
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,823
Let's take the key
from around his neck.

672
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,226
We're gonna have to be
very quiet.

673
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,361
Let's walk
on the tips of our toes.

674
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,442
Will you stop playing
that tiny piano?

675
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,910
You're gonna get us caught.

676
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,246
Sorry.

677
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:33,416
Now just reach over
and grab it.

678
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,655
Halt! Who goes there?

679
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,735
Stop! Pull it over his head!
Oh.

680
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,338
Stop, stop, stop!

681
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,443
Let me get up there.

682
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,674
Help me.

683
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,846
What?

684
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,015
No!

685
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,617
Plankton, help!

686
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,921
I'll rock him,
you tell him a bedtime story.

687
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,756
Once upon a time

688
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:50,460
there was a big fat
pink idiot who went
to sleep. The end!

689
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,962
Nice try,
but it's gonna take
more than that to...

690
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:03,673
<i>I told you, I don't have
the formula, you monsters!</i>

691
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,376
Hey, baby, how are you?
<i>Plankton!</i>

692
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,511
<i>My hero!
You must need something,</i>

693
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,380
<i>otherwise you wouldn't
have come back.</i>

694
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,982
Plankton has a plan
to save Bikini Bottom.

695
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:21,057
<i>It doesn't matter, Plankton.
Krabs knows all your plans.</i>

696
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,742
<i>He's been through
my hard drive</i>

697
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:24,426
<i>looking for
the secret formula.</i>

698
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,996
Eh, I never had it.
But we're going to get it.

699
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,865
We're gonna go back in time

700
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,067
to steal the formula
before it disappeared.

701
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,953
<i>Time travel!</i>

702
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,838
<i>Where are you gonna find
a computer that can do that?</i>

703
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,939
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

704
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,045
I've never carried
a head before.

705
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,546
You'll get used to it.

706
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,081
It's still warm.

707
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,418
So you won't talk, huh?

708
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,820
Let some air out of him.

709
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,993
Is this where
we're gonna build
our time machine?

710
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,496
Sure.
It's got everything we need.

711
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:00,663
A photo booth.

712
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:03,767
A cuckoo clock.

713
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,168
Some day-old chips.

714
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,036
Now all we have to do
is build it.

715
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:09,906
Oh, no, you don't!

716
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,441
Hey, my pitch pipe!

717
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,877
Uh, I need it.
For the time machine.

718
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,945
Oh. Okay.

719
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,451
Installed!

720
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,864
Mmm.

721
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,506
I did it!

722
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,742
No, we did it!

723
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,677
Wait. We did do it.

724
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,812
As a tee-am.

725
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,047
A team.
Whatever.

726
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:54,150
<i>¶ Working together
in harmony</i>

727
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,786
<i>¶ Side by side,
we can reach our dreams</i>

728
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,623
<i>¶ 'Cause nothing's impossible
When we're a team ¶</i>

729
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,892
Okay, now for the brains!

730
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,696
<i>Okay, Plankton, this is it.</i>

731
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,565
<i>It's gonna take
all my processors</i>

732
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,667
<i>and energy to power
this time machine.</i>

733
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,602
<i>So if you have anything
you wanna tell me,</i>

734
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:13,837
<i>you better tell me now.</i>

735
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,506
Well, Karen...

736
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,174
I know I've taken you
for granted

737
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,809
all these years, and

738
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:23,680
I, I just wanted to say,

739
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,882
I'm glad
you're on my tee-am.

740
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,550
<i>Oh, Sheldon,</i>

741
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,272
<i>that's the sweetest thing
you've ever...</i>

742
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,725
Plankton, are you crying?

743
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,927
No, no, no!

744
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,964
It's just one of the hazards
of having a giant eyeball.

745
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,999
There's always stuff
getting in there.

746
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,901
Anyway,
where were we?

747
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,536
Say "cheese."

748
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,172
Cheese!

749
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,964
According to
my calculations,

750
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,034
The Krusty Krab
should be right here!

751
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,736
What's that over there?

752
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:23,606
SpongeBob?
Patrick?

753
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:25,108
Is it really you?

754
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,243
Yes, Patrick, it's...
Finally!

755
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:31,214
The Great Krabby
Patty Famine is over!

756
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,684
Great Krabby Patty Famine?
Oh, what year is this?

757
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,019
It's Thursday.

758
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,121
According to
my calculations,

759
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,757
we've only gone
four days into the future.

760
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:42,725
Where is everybody?

761
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:46,162
They all gave up on you.
But not me!

762
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,998
Cause I'm not very smart.

763
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,267
Where is The Krusty Krab?

764
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,509
Right where
it's always been!

765
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:24,100
I think we may be
lost in time, Plankton.

766
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,202
Maybe we should ask
this guy for directions.

767
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:31,374
Excuse me, sir?
Can you tell us when we are?

768
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:36,713
Who dares disturb
The One Who Watches?

769
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:37,947
The One Who Watches?

770
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,949
Your name is
The One Who Watches?

771
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,386
No, my true name is

772
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,121
Bubbles.

773
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,957
Bubbles?

774
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,927
What kind of a name
is Bubbles?

775
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,696
It is my ancient
dolphin name.

776
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,231
So what's a dolphin
doing out here

777
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,766
in the middle of space?

778
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:57,934
My kind

779
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:00,336
have been watching
and protecting

780
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,705
the galaxy for...

781
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,707
Hmm.

782
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,943
10,000 years!

783
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:09,212
Oh, so you're the one

784
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:11,080
keeping the meteors
from hitting us.

785
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,815
Yes, I am.

786
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,818
And I could really do
with a potty break.

787
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,088
Would you mind
keeping an eye
on things?

788
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,659
Sure thing. But, uh,
what am I keeping my eye on?

789
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:33,202
What are you doing?

790
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:34,971
I'm watching.

791
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:36,839
We don't even know
what we're watching for.

792
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,841
Maybe we should
split up the workload.

793
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,777
You watch the one
with the big red eye,

794
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,311
I'll watch the one
with the ringy thingies.

795
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:44,147
Like a team.

796
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:45,948
Okay, mine's moving.

797
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,150
Mine, too.

798
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:49,886
No, this doesn't
seem right.

799
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:51,037
Should we call Bubbles?

800
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:52,187
Let's give him a minute.
He's been holding it

801
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,423
for 10,000 years.

802
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,763
I'm pretty sure that wasn't
supposed to happen.

803
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,398
Come on, Plankton,
we got to clean this up

804
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,300
before Bubbles gets back!

805
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:12,241
Much better. Yes.

806
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:14,711
You two are free to go.

807
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,784
What happened to
Saturn and Jupiter?

808
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,756
You were supposed to...

809
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:35,898
Keep them from smashing
into each other!

810
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,066
Sorry.

811
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,335
Now
I am going to lose my job!

812
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,905
And you will lose your lives.

813
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:51,881
Quarter me!

814
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,474
Plankton?

815
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,243
SpongeBob!

816
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,113
Plankton?

817
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,548
SpongeBob?

818
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,416
Who are you two
supposed to be?

819
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,285
I'm you, from the future.

820
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,154
And I'm him from the future.

821
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:32,789
So you traveled
back through time

822
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,557
to help me?
Great thinking.

823
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,225
Nope. He's helping me.

824
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,527
But he's the enemy!

825
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:40,096
Was the enemy.
Now we're a team.

826
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:42,064
What? A tee-am?

827
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:44,033
A team!

828
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,569
All right,
go get the formula.

829
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:48,237
What have I become?

830
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,872
All right, Plankton.

831
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,043
Do you have
flying boatmobiles
in the future?

832
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:55,244
We only came back

833
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,413
from the day
after tomorrow, dimwit.

834
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,248
Are there rocket packs?

835
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,983
Oh!

836
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,051
Did they outlaw

837
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:03,386
clothes in the future?
No!

838
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:04,954
Then why are you naked?

839
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,156
Because they don't make
clothes in my size.

840
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,158
Hold still, you!

841
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:13,462
If you're from the future,
what am I gonna say next?

842
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,464
Something moronic?
Wow.

843
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,433
Hey, hurry up over there!

844
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:20,937
Uh-oh. That ain't good.

845
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:22,839
<i>Initiating lockdown sequence.</i>

846
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,174
Come on, SpongeBob,
we gotta get out of here!

847
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:28,511
Got it!
Come on!

848
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,323
Oh, that was crazy!

849
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,625
So that's what teamwork is.

850
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:45,361
All those years
I tried to make you mine,

851
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,330
and I finally did it.

852
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:50,099
I mean, we did it!

853
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:53,436
And so it would seem that

854
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:57,907
our heroes have accomplished
all they had set out to do.

855
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:01,010
Now that's an ending.
Whoo-hoo!

856
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,446
Andy, cue the music.

857
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,951
Oh, no.

858
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,953
That's not the end.

859
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,890
So you mean the ending
might be even happier?

860
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:19,201
Here we go!

861
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,999
Land ho!

862
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:27,436
Mom, where's my towel?

863
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,439
What?

864
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,478
Whoa!

865
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,839
- Whoa! Dude, look at that.
- What?

866
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:44,086
I'm coming! Come on,
you lazy people!

867
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,690
Out of my way!
I'm coming!

868
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:50,059
Out of there!

869
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,294
Sorry!

870
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,663
Too fast!
Slow down!

871
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:55,932
- I'm coming!
- No, no!

872
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,115
Yeah!

873
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:17,053
All right,
you feathered rats,
time to shove off!

874
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,422
What? Why?

875
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:22,591
Well, I can't have
you pooping

876
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,294
all over my restaurant,
can I?

877
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,296
Restaurant? I thought
this was a pirate ship.

878
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,399
Oh, it is.

879
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:31,734
But it is also...

880
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,081
A-ha!

881
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:49,051
My very own food truck!

882
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:50,252
A what?

883
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:52,989
Uh, you know,
a restaurant on wheels.

884
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,057
Like a garbage truck.
No!

885
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,460
Are you trying to
scare away my customers?

886
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:00,182
Well, we're not leaving
till we see
how the story ends.

887
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:02,465
No problem.

888
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:07,169
You guys like
a little snack
while you wait?

889
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,771
Sure, I'll take
a curdled milk.
How about a fish head?

890
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,373
And a French fry
covered in sand.

891
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,742
Who wants some

892
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:15,444
hot wings?

893
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,013
Wait a minute.
Where's Kyle?

894
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:21,083
Which one of you is next?

895
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:23,786
He's a madman!

896
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:24,687
Let's get out of here!

897
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,655
You crazy, man! You crazy!

898
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,394
Bye-bye, Mr. Poop.

899
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:32,636
Now I can get
my gold sticker.

900
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,565
Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate.

901
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,607
I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

902
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:42,304
Boo!

903
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,241
I can't fly without
my feathers.

904
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:48,711
Where to, Mac?

905
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,379
Just dwive.

906
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:00,056
Oh...

907
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,257
Squidward!

908
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:03,159
Still out of
Krabby Patties.

909
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:07,830
Does anyone have a picture

910
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,398
of ketchup?

911
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,067
I done figgered it out!

912
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,805
We have angered
the sandwich gods

913
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:20,076
and only a sacrifice
will appease them!

914
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,644
Well, that sounds
reasonable.

915
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:25,448
Soon our
post-apoca-whatchamacallit
will be over,

916
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,218
and Krabby Patties
will rain down from above!

917
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,754
Rain down?
Well, that's no good.

918
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,689
How will I get me money?

919
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:37,193
Oh, you don't like that idea?
Then we'll sacrifice you!

920
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,562
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

921
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:47,703
It's not a good idea
to have a sacrifice

922
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,839
on an empty stomach.

923
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:52,241
Who wants a Krabby Patty?

924
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:57,179
SpongeBob,
is that me formuler?

925
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:58,681
Oh, happy day!

926
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,784
I missed you so much.

927
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:04,186
Where was it?
Where did you find it?

928
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:06,222
Well, Plankton and I
built a time machine

929
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:07,790
out of an old photo booth
and then we added...

930
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,126
Cheese!
Patrick, wait!

931
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:12,661
It's okay, everyone.

932
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,531
The post-apocalypse
is almost over!

933
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,736
Ain't that right, SpongeBob?

934
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:23,873
"Eugene, eat my

935
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:26,275
"subaquatic air bubbles.

936
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:27,476
"Love, Plankton"?

937
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,779
You grabbed
the wrong bottle!

938
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,715
I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!

939
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,683
That's okay, SpongeBob.

940
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:37,820
We'll just have to sacrifice
the two of you then.

941
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,756
Prepare them
for the sacrifice!

942
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:46,162
I bring a message
from the dawn of time!

943
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:47,363
What is it, Patrick?

944
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:49,298
Run!

945
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:54,236
Squidosaurus rex!

946
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,748
Well, Plankton,

947
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,184
I guess we failed
to accomplish our goals.

948
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:09,752
"We"?

949
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:11,687
But even failure
hurts a little less

950
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,190
when you do it
as a team, right?

951
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,791
This is all your fault!

952
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,495
My fault?

953
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,897
You're the one who stole
the wrong secret formula.

954
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:23,832
I didn't know
there were two bottles.

955
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,202
Of course you didn't!

956
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,404
Because you got
cotton candy for brains!

957
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,939
Ooh!

958
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,274
No, seriously,
he really does.

959
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:33,809
Well, we wouldn't
even be in this mess

960
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:36,345
in the first place, if you
weren't so selfish and evil.

961
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:38,414
I was selfish and evil,

962
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,383
until you ruined everything
with your "teamwork"!

963
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,485
Oh! You take that back!

964
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,522
You are the worst
teammate ever!

965
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:48,290
No!

966
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:01,737
Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing
garbage and recycling!

967
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,682
Look at me.

968
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:16,859
Why, I've become
like all of you.

969
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:18,821
Savage.

970
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:20,489
Fear-ridden.

971
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,291
Selfish.

972
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:25,394
An entire town
of formerly good citizens

973
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:27,930
turned into heartless freaks,

974
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,698
bent on their own
self-prever...

975
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,533
Self-preter...

976
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:33,969
"Preservation?"
Yes!

977
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,872
We've become alienated
from each other.

978
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:39,275
Each one an island
unto himself,

979
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,443
concerned only with
ourselves.

980
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,445
And in the name
of all fishhood,

981
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,481
I am not about
to let that happen!

982
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,387
And so,

983
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,589
if a sacrifice
is needed to restore

984
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,791
Bikini Bottom
to its former glory...

985
00:54:57,928 --> 00:55:01,297
Then I am willing
to take one for the team!

986
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,709
You heard him!

987
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:16,679
Sacrifice!

988
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:19,715
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

989
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,383
Sacrifice!

990
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:24,420
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

991
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,728
Let the sacrifice begin!

992
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,630
Patties! Patties!

993
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,734
And I thought
my friends were primitive.

994
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,904
Don't cry, me boy.

995
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:45,341
Everything's going
to be fine, for us.

996
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,810
Oh, I'm not crying,
Mr. Krabs.

997
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:49,411
I smell Krabby Patties!

998
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:54,350
That's right. Keep thinking
happy thoughts. Now!

999
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:56,192
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

1000
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,365
The boy's right.

1001
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,066
My leg!

1002
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,701
I smell 'em, too!

1003
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,070
Okay, SpongeBob, go get it!

1004
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:18,774
Wait. You mean we can
just take this stuff off?

1005
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,542
Go find that Krabby Patty!

1006
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,514
Come on, everybody!

1007
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:28,684
I've got some Krabby Patty
orders to fill!

1008
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,494
It's coming from over there!

1009
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:03,852
Come on, guys, I think
it's just over this hill.

1010
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:10,058
How do you expect us
to go up to the surface?

1011
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,560
We won't be able to breathe!

1012
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,796
All right,
all secondary characters

1013
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:15,464
come with me.

1014
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah, I'm with you guys.
No way, Squidward.

1015
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:20,102
You're going up there
with us.

1016
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,837
My feet hurt.

1017
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,606
Patrick, you don't
have feet.

1018
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,443
It's not fair!
You have feet.

1019
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:31,213
Sandy has feet.
Squidward has feet.

1020
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:32,681
Actually,
I have four feet.

1021
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:38,153
It's not about feet.

1022
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,888
What is it about, then?

1023
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,657
It's about being a team

1024
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,892
and sticking together,
no matter what!

1025
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,462
The only way we're going
up there is if some

1026
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:49,498
fairy godmother shows up
and helps us breathe air.

1027
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,840
Bubbles!
SpongeBob,
you know this guy?

1028
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:00,075
Don't hurt us!
We're sorry we got you fired.

1029
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:02,544
Hurt you?

1030
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:05,581
Why, I traveled back
through time to thank you.

1031
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,750
I've been stuck
in that job for eons.

1032
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:10,886
I needed a change,

1033
00:58:10,888 --> 00:58:14,022
but I was too afraid
to go for it.

1034
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:16,892
Well, Bubbles,
I'm glad we could help.

1035
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:19,661
Now it is my turn to help.

1036
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,631
I can get you safely
to the surface.

1037
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,266
Now!

1038
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:27,703
Quick, all of you,
get in my mouth.

1039
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,204
Come on, guys, let's go!

1040
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:32,508
There's no way I'm climbing
into some dolphin's mouth.

1041
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,210
Yeah. This guy
just wants a free lunch.

1042
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:37,246
Guys, if Bubbles
has the courage

1043
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,581
to quit his dead-end,
nowhere job

1044
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,216
and travel back through time
to help us,

1045
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,051
then we need
to have the courage to...

1046
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,192
Well, I never thought
I'd be eaten by a dolphin.

1047
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,827
No, if he was eating us,

1048
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:53,996
he'd be chewing us up
and we'd be going down there.

1049
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:56,665
This is what you call
riding in style.

1050
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,867
Not a lot
of legroom in here.

1051
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,837
Well, maybe if you
didn't have four feet!

1052
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,837
Note to self:
Never stow away
in a gym sock.

1053
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:20,155
What's happening?
I feel tingly!

1054
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,946
Ow, my neck!

1055
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:34,236
I've done all I can.

1056
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:36,705
The rest is up to you.

1057
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,206
Thank you, Bubbles!

1058
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,275
Farewell, SpongeBob.

1059
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,077
Farewell, Bubbles.

1060
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,146
Now to update my...

1061
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,350
Resume!

1062
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:56,124
Ah! Fresh air!
Oh, how I've missed you.

1063
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,760
Ugh! This place
smells awful!

1064
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,329
Come on, guys.

1065
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:01,964
Let's get
the Krabby Patty formula

1066
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,086
and save Bikini Bottom.

1067
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,068
Whoa!

1068
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,637
What is this place?

1069
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,773
I have
a bad feeling about this.

1070
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:15,043
Maybe this guy knows
where we are.
He looks smart.

1071
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:16,912
He's got five heads.

1072
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:20,115
Uh, sir? Could you tell us
where to find a Krabby Patty?

1073
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,651
Hey, my friend's
talking to you!

1074
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:25,821
What?

1075
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,157
A giant, hairy porpoise!

1076
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,293
It's beached!

1077
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,630
It's suffering.
Poor thing.

1078
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:35,864
Y'all, those aren't
porpoises.

1079
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:38,900
All hands on deck!
Oh, brother.

1080
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:40,902
We need to get these guys
back in the water.

1081
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:42,204
Come on! Push!

1082
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:44,373
- Heave!
- Ho!

1083
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:48,343
- Heave!
- Ho!

1084
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:51,246
- Heave!
- Ho!

1085
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:52,748
Put your back into it!

1086
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,182
Come on, push!

1087
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:57,219
Well, I guess
this is where that

1088
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:59,381
horrible smell
was coming from.

1089
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:13,935
Whoa!

1090
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:15,337
Excuse me, do you know
where we can get

1091
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,172
a Krabby Patty around here?

1092
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,807
Invaders!

1093
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:20,175
Uh-oh.

1094
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,944
You get out of
my sister's sand castle!

1095
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:25,066
Mom!

1096
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,125
Oh!

1097
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:41,797
Where have you been
all my life?

1098
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:47,736
Ow. Whoa!

1099
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:49,971
Mmm.

1100
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:52,074
Oh, Frank.

1101
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:53,942
That feels so good.

1102
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,145
Gross!

1103
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,050
Oh, hey, Squidward.

1104
01:02:02,453 --> 01:02:04,152
Sandy!

1105
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:05,821
The Krabby Patty!

1106
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,663
I think I see
where it's coming from!

1107
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:22,370
SpongeBob, you will not
believe the size

1108
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,972
of the ice creams here.

1109
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:26,308
I wonder what other
giant snacks they have.

1110
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,376
Cotton candy?

1111
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:32,514
Wow.

1112
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,149
If you ate all that,
you'd have enough energy

1113
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:35,350
to run around
the whole world!

1114
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,885
Whoo-hoo!

1115
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,809
Ugh! When is the sugar
gonna wear off?

1116
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:10,018
Hey, guys,
I smell Krabby Patties!

1117
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,020
I think it's this way!
Huh?

1118
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,159
Don't leave me,
Squidward!

1119
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:26,234
Now what?
We're never going to
make it!

1120
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:27,870
Huh?

1121
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,209
Heave!
Ho!

1122
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:36,077
Heave!
Ho!

1123
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,719
Heave!
Ho!

1124
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,850
We're doing it, guys!

1125
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,520
Dude, watch out!

1126
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:46,922
Hold on!

1127
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:50,192
SpongeBob!

1128
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:53,028
Huh? Lean!
Starboard!

1129
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:55,530
Whoa!

1130
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,606
What the...
What?

1131
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:07,442
"Home of the Krabby Patty"?

1132
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:12,280
But The Krusty Krab
is the home
of the Krabby Patty!

1133
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:14,049
Mr. Krabs,
what are we gonna do?

1134
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:16,318
$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?

1135
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,554
Why didn't I think of that?

1136
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,034
You!
Huh?

1137
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:37,405
Cease and desist that
unauthorized patty flipping!

1138
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,274
Yeah, that's my job!

1139
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:40,636
How did you get here?

1140
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,111
You cannot breathe air.

1141
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:45,113
Well, there was
this magical dolphin

1142
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,982
from the future who shot us
out of his blowhole, and...

1143
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:48,950
Wait! Wait.

1144
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,556
That's not in the book.

1145
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:55,924
Book?

1146
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:58,293
There is no magical dolphin
in this story.

1147
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:01,463
What story?

1148
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:06,268
The story
of how Bikini Bottom
was brought to its knees

1149
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,037
when its beloved
Krabby Patty formula

1150
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,406
was stolen by me,

1151
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,008
Burger Beard.

1152
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:16,344
How does it end?

1153
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:18,413
Well, let me see.

1154
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,049
It looks like, uh,

1155
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:24,953
Burger Beard
becomes the richest

1156
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:29,024
food truck proprietor
in all the land.

1157
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,159
But how did you
steal the formula?

1158
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,994
That was easy.

1159
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:36,298
I simply rewrote
the story, and...

1160
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,565
Poof!

1161
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,301
Me formuler!

1162
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:41,336
What do you mean,
rewrote the story?

1163
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:42,604
Watch this.

1164
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:45,507
"The brave

1165
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:47,475
"and handsome

1166
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,477
"Burger Beard

1167
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:52,547
"banished our poor heroes..."

1168
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,983
"...to be stranded on

1169
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:57,319
"Pelican Island!"

1170
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,490
"The End"!

1171
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,230
Oh, this looks bad.

1172
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,066
And these guys
look hungry!

1173
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:15,337
Look out!

1174
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,610
Nice. So this is
what teamwork gets you.

1175
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:25,480
Here! Take Squidward,
you vile beasts!

1176
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,984
I want to be on a new team.
This one's broken.

1177
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,426
Sandy, you're smart.
You have any ideas?

1178
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:33,421
I ain't been too smart

1179
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:35,991
since I found
this old piece of paper!

1180
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,429
- What?
- Incoming!

1181
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:50,338
Wait a minute!

1182
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,708
Now all we need

1183
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,143
is some ink!

1184
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,225
Oh. Which Squidward
has helpfully provided.

1185
01:06:58,148 --> 01:06:59,748
It happens when I'm nervous.

1186
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:02,450
Whatever you're going to do,

1187
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:04,753
make it quick!
They're closing in on us!

1188
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:06,321
I'm gonna write us an ending.

1189
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:10,325
Will it be a happy ending?

1190
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:12,694
It's going to be
superpowered!

1191
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:25,106
I'll show you
a happy ending.

1192
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:38,287
Huh?

1193
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:42,557
Da-da-da-da!

1194
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,159
Patrick!
Huh?

1195
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,128
Hey, I got feet!

1196
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:51,199
Oh, what is in these things?

1197
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:56,137
We'll take one
secret formula to go!

1198
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:00,642
Clear the area, citizens.

1199
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:03,644
There's going to be
some serious
aft-kicking here.

1200
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:09,617
But I banished you.

1201
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:11,152
Sour Note?

1202
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:21,362
My tiny little eardrums!

1203
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,534
Hey, hey, wait!
Hold on! Hold on!

1204
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:29,370
Wait! Wait! Customers!

1205
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,873
Wait, please!

1206
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,508
Mr. Superawesomeness,

1207
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:35,244
take him down.

1208
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,446
Huh?
Huh?

1209
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:54,596
Um, maybe we
should have picked

1210
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,297
a better superpower
for you, Patrick.

1211
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:01,369
Let's see you get out
of this one!

1212
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,851
Ka-ching!

1213
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:11,146
Get ready
for the Invinci-Bubble!

1214
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,583
No!

1215
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,218
My book!

1216
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,323
All right, team,
time for hands in the middle!

1217
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,591
Yes! Huh?

1218
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:25,260
Oh, yeah.

1219
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:34,435
Great job, guys.
We did it!

1220
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:35,437
Ew!

1221
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:37,572
Huh?

1222
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:38,640
What?

1223
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:41,276
Sandy? Is that you?

1224
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:44,279
You can call me The Rodent!

1225
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:45,747
Hi-yah!

1226
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:48,216
Hey, where'd the pirate go?

1227
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:53,721
Hmm. Uh...

1228
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:58,960
Mmm.

1229
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,929
It looks like Burger Beard

1230
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:04,199
forgot the first rule
of mobile fry cooking.

1231
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,334
Always batten down
your grease traps.

1232
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,804
Follow that grease, team!

1233
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,129
There she blows.

1234
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:39,300
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1235
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,004
Whoo-hoo!

1236
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,430
Whoo!

1237
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,701
Oh, no, you don't.

1238
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:18,640
Ow!

1239
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,611
Oh!

1240
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:42,563
He's after the book!

1241
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,833
Sandy, use your
squirrel powers!

1242
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:46,901
Roger that!

1243
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,030
Oh, she's never gonna
make it!

1244
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:57,945
Huh? Everyone...

1245
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,681
Lean!

1246
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,599
That's what you get.

1247
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:33,414
Come here.

1248
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:34,416
Come here.

1249
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:36,517
The book!

1250
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,952
Sour Note!

1251
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,769
All right, Burger Beard,

1252
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,971
prepare to be teamworked!

1253
01:12:56,973 --> 01:13:00,575
I'm going to scrub
my armpits with you.

1254
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:02,710
Uh, I don't get it.

1255
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,011
Because you're a sponge.

1256
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:05,446
Duh.

1257
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:06,848
Oh.

1258
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,483
Get him, The Rodent!

1259
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:10,485
Consider him roasted!

1260
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:21,896
Huh?

1261
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,840
Aw, nuts!
I'm all out of nuts!

1262
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:42,083
Justice is best soft served.

1263
01:13:48,191 --> 01:13:50,892
Patrick, I should have
never doubted your powers!

1264
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:06,641
I can't think
of a sweeter way to go.

1265
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,812
Ha! It's all mine!

1266
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:13,648
Not so fast, Booger Beard!

1267
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,467
Me formuler. Huh?

1268
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,937
This will make you
feel a little butter.

1269
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:39,041
Not melted butter!

1270
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:44,579
Mr. Krabs!

1271
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:51,152
<i>Voila!</i>

1272
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,154
Uh-oh.

1273
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,130
A-ha!

1274
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,833
Oh, yeah!

1275
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,034
Huh?

1276
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:08,102
Hoo-hoo!

1277
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,587
Ta-da!

1278
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,059
They're beautiful!

1279
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:34,929
Patrick!

1280
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,079
I gotcha!

1281
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:53,548
SpongeBob!

1282
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,217
Patrick?
Talk to me, buddy.

1283
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:59,053
I'm... I'm seeing
a bright light.

1284
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,088
Is this better?

1285
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,757
Much. Thank you.

1286
01:16:02,759 --> 01:16:05,893
But the discomfort I feel
in my eyes is nothing

1287
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,595
compared to the shame I feel

1288
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,730
for letting down the Patty.

1289
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,899
For letting down
Bikini Bottom.

1290
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,735
Yeah, SpongeBob,
you really blew it.

1291
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,039
No, Patrick, we blew it,
as a team.

1292
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,207
Nope. This one's on you.

1293
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:25,980
Where do you
think you're going?

1294
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:32,853
Why don't you get going,
little fella,

1295
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:34,322
before you hurt yourself?

1296
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:47,602
Plankton?

1297
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,004
It's Plank-Ton!

1298
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:54,809
Come on down from there,
little fella.

1299
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,878
You wouldn't want to
get hurt.

1300
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:00,147
Huh?

1301
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:23,938
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1302
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,139
Huh?

1303
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:27,274
My eye!

1304
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:41,856
He's getting away!

1305
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:47,662
Ready for a Plank-Ton
of bubbles?

1306
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:11,986
The formula, please.

1307
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:14,021
Come on. Team up with me.

1308
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,157
We'll be rich
and powerful! Huh?

1309
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,391
No, thanks.

1310
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,360
I'm already
part of a teamwork.

1311
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,319
Can we do hands
in the middle again?

1312
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,088
Yes, we can, Patrick.

1313
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,490
But this time,
there's one more hand
to go in the middle.

1314
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:53,828
Plankton?

1315
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,997
Hmm.

1316
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,766
Oh, no.

1317
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:05,740
Here you go, Krabs.
Huh?

1318
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:07,308
She's all yours.

1319
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:10,790
This doesn't have
another insulting
note in it, does it?

1320
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,214
No, that's the old me.

1321
01:19:13,216 --> 01:19:15,516
The one who turned his back
on everything important

1322
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:18,486
just to have that formula
all to himself.

1323
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:20,221
But I realize now
that keeping

1324
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:22,389
something to myself is...

1325
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,492
Selfish.

1326
01:19:24,494 --> 01:19:26,360
Especially
when that something

1327
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:27,828
is the Krabby Patty.

1328
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,463
Okay, everybody,
let's get back

1329
01:19:29,465 --> 01:19:31,432
to Bikini Bottom and...

1330
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:34,068
Oh, no!
I don't have the page!

1331
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,503
Oh, no!

1332
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,937
It must be
back on Pelican Island!

1333
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:40,508
Don't worry.
I thought of everything.

1334
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:43,010
All right, SpongeBob,
take us home.

1335
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,478
Thanks.

1336
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,814
Squidward!
Oh, yeah.

1337
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,349
Come on,
it's time to go back

1338
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:50,551
and open up The Krusty Krab!

1339
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:53,053
Are you out of your
patty-flipping mind?

1340
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:54,355
I'll never leave this place!

1341
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:57,558
I mean, look at me.
I'm a god!

1342
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,060
No, Squidward,
you're a cashier.

1343
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:04,832
Wait a minute! What? No!

1344
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:11,038
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

1345
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,141
Don't be sad, Squidward.

1346
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,343
I left you a little surprise
under your shirt!

1347
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,948
Rock-hard abs!

1348
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:24,351
Aw, SpongeBob,
you're okay in my book.

1349
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,986
Aw, shucks.

1350
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:29,590
Excuse us! We'd like 3,000
Krabby Patties, please!

1351
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,296
That sound must mean
things are back to normal.

1352
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:39,066
Who wants
3,000 Krabby Patties?

1353
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,872
First one's for you, Gary.

1354
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,907
Extra mayo,
just the way you like it.

1355
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,177
A-ha!

1356
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,879
Caught you red-handed!

1357
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:53,914
Gary hates mayo.

1358
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:57,518
Plankton!
Up to your old tricks
again already, eh?

1359
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,120
Hey, I'm just
putting things back
the way they were.

1360
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:01,989
What do you have
to say about this, Gary?

1361
01:21:01,991 --> 01:21:03,924
Oh, shrimp.

1362
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,634
See you later,
tee-am-mate!

1363
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:20,975
- Now can we sing it?
- Yeah!

1364
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:25,346
Pwease, Mr. Piwate?

1365
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,348
Oh, Kyle...

1366
01:21:28,618 --> 01:21:31,886
How can I say no to you?

1367
01:21:33,623 --> 01:21:35,489
Are you ready, kids?

1368
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:37,224
Aye-aye, Captain!

1369
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:40,628
Uh, what did you say?
There's sand in my ears and

1370
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,897
I can't hear you!

1371
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:45,399
Aye-aye, Captain!

1372
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,936

Silence!

Oh, man. I like that song.
What happened?

1386
01:22:16,065 --> 01:22:18,399
I don't like that song
and I put an end to it.

1387
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:20,034
Well, this music
is terrible.

1388
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:21,268
I suppose
you're entitled to your...

1389
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,970
