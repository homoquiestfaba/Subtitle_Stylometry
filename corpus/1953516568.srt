00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,367
THE CAR IS BEING
REPOSSESSED, SIR.

179
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,271
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
LOOK, SIR HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

180
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,206
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

181
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,541
LOOK, SIR, CAN YOU JUST
HEAR ME OUT?

182
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,176
UH, ANTHONY.

183
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,312
ANTHONY, CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME?

184
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,915
I MISSED A COUPLE OF PAYMENTS.
THAT'S ALL.

185
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,950
IT SAYS HERE
YOU'RE SIX MONTHS BEHIND

186
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,185
AND OWE ALMOST $4,000.

187
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,288
LOOK, MAN, CAN'T YOU JUST
CUT ME SOME SLACK ON THIS ONE?

188
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,923
JUST THIS ONE TIME. PLEASE.

189
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,224
LOOK, I'D LOVE
TO HELP YOU OUT, BROTHER.

190
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,525
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT

191
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,261
BEFORE YOU TRIED LIVING
ABOVE YOUR MEANS.

192
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,300
LOOK, CAN I AT LEAST
GET SOMETHING

193
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,636
SURE. IF YOU GIVE ME THE KEYS.

194
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,278
FINE.

195
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:37,969
HAVE A NICE DAY, SIR.

196
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,370
YEAH. WHATEVER.

197
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,225
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

198
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,236
WHAT THE HELL YOU LOOKING AT?

199
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,313
VINCE, KYLE IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

200
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,582
YOU'RE LATE.

201
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:29,053
YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
A ROTTEN MORNING.

202
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:34,392
SO WHAT'S THE WORD?
WHERE AM I HEADED NEXT?

203
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,428
WELL, KYLE.

204
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,265
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
THIS IS FOR ME TO SAY.

205
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,268
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

206
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,072
I CONTACTED EVERY TEAM.

207
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,674
EVERY SINGLE TEAM.

208
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,410
I GOT NOTHING.

209
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,614
DUDE, WHAT ABOUT CANADA
OR THE UFL OR ARENA?

210
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,283
THEM, TOO.
CALLED THEM ALL.

211
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,420
NOTHING.

212
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,490
SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
NOT ONE TEAM CALLED ABOUT ME.

213
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,625
NO. A FEW DID.

214
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,494
THEN SOME YOUNGER PLAYERS
GOT RELEASED,

215
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,495
AND THEY WENT
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

216
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,497
YOUNGER PLAYERS? I'M 25.

217
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,300
I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT. MAN.

218
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,638
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, KYLE, OK?

219
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,108
THIS IS A BUSINESS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THIS.

220
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,476
YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY LUCKY

221
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,378
TO GO FROM TEAM TO TEAM
THE WAY YOU HAVE.

222
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,546
THIS IS LUCKY?

223
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,681
VINCE, I'M LIVING OUT OF
MY GODDAMN SUITCASE,

224
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,651
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

225
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,553
TALK TO ME.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

226
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,356
WHAT IS MY BEST
AND MY WORST CASE SCENARIO HERE?

227
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,691
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
DEALING WITH PLAYERS

228
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,094
IN YOUR SIMILAR SITUATION,

229
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,495
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY DIFFICULT

230
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,464
TO GET YOU A WORKOUT
WITH A TEAM RIGHT NOW.

231
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,401
BEST CASE SCENARIO,
YOU STAY IN SHAPE,

232
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,103
AND WE'LL ATTACK IT AGAIN
NEXT SEASON.

233
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,338
WORST CASE SCENARIO...

234
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,743
YOU MAY HAVE TO BEGIN ADJUSTING
TO LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL.

235
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,114
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

236
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,385
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

237
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,754
BECAUSE I'M NOT READY
TO BE RETIRED, MAN.

238
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,427
ALL I KNOW IS FOOTBALL.

239
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,362
THAT'S ALL I'VE DONE
MY WHOLE LIFE.

240
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,499
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

241
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,470
KYLE.

242
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,507
IF ANYTHING COMES MY WAY,

243
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,743
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,
ANYTHING CHANGES,

244
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,713
I WILL CALL YOU IMMEDIATELY.

245
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,583
BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW,

246
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,419
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

247
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,787
I'M SORRY.

248
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,715
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

249
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,790
THE MAN OF THE HOUR.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

250
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,526
SO YOU GOT A MINUTE?

251
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,561
UH, YEAH, I WAS GETTING READY
TO HEAD TO WORK,

252
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,695
BUT YEAH, COME ON IN.

253
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,670
WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?

254
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,672
OH, NO, I'M GOOD.

255
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,541
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF.

256
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,616
YO, YOU KNOW STACEY
IS REALLY DIGGING YOU, RIGHT?

257
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,485
MAN, THAT GIRL
AIN'T THINKING ABOUT ME.

258
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,719
SHE LIKE WHAT I REPRESENT.

259
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,656
WHATEVER, MAN. I CAN TELL.
SHE'S DIGGING YOU.

260
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,858
SOMETIMES THINGS AIN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM, BRO.

261
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,560
WHAT YOU MEAN?

262
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,229
I'M DONE PLAYING.

263
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,630
YOU THINK SHE'LL LIKE ME NOW?

264
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,698
WHEN THIS HAPPEN?

265
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,600
YESTERDAY, I MET WITH MY AGENT,

266
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,868
HE PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME
IT WAS A WRAP.

267
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,240
SORRY TO HEAR THAT, MAN.

268
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,808
WHAT, WERE YOU LIKE
DROPPING TOO MANY PASSES?

269
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,842
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED?

270
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,711
NAH, MAN,
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

271
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,479
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST POLITICS.

272
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,515
SO YOU BACK FOR GOOD NOW?

273
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:22,787
WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT
ALL THAT MONEY SAVED UP, RIGHT?

274
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,255
NOT EXACTLY.

275
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,623
WHAT?

276
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,491
I BLEW THROUGH
MOST OF THAT MONEY.

277
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,626
DAMN.

278
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,661
I GOT TO FIND A JOB.

279
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,264
WELL, YOU KNOW WE HIRING
AT THE GYM, RIGHT?

280
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,565
NAH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

281
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,834
YEAH, MAN, I COULD
TALK TO MY MANAGER.

282
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,302
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

283
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,671
DUDE, RIGHT ABOUT NOW,
THAT WOULD BE DOPE.

284
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,506
LEAST I CAN DO.

285
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,641
I APPRECIATE IT.

286
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,842
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
IT'S GON' BE STRAIGHT.

287
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,744
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DOING
LATER, MAN.

288
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,779
YOU CAN COME BACK THROUGH
AND WATCH THE GAME.

289
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:52,550
YEAH, HONESTLY, BRO,
I'D RATHER NOT, MAN.

290
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,719
ALL RIGHT. I GET IT, MAN.

291
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,687
I GUESS
I'LL HOLLER AT YOU LATER.

292
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,922
- FOR SURE.
- ALRIGHT.

293
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,876
I NEED YOU TO WRITE ONE FACT

294
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,678
ABOUT EACH
CALIFORNIA INDIAN GROUP.

295
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,779
NOW IN YOUR STUDY JOURNAL--

296
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,819
GIVE ME ONE SECOND, KIDS.
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

297
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,625
GOOD TO SEE YOU, KYLE.

298
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:08,993
OH, IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

299
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,797
SORRY TO DROP BY
UNANNOUNCED.

300
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,931
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

301
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,700
IS EVERYTHING OK?

302
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,001
YES AND NO.

303
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,805
UM, I JUST NEEDED YOUR ADVICE
ON A FEW THINGS.

304
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,807
I'M SO GLAD
YOU SHOWED UP TODAY.

305
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,942
I COULD ACTUALLY
USE YOUR HELP, TOO.

306
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,812
SURE. WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

307
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,915
STEP INTO MY OFFICE.

308
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,852
TODAY IS CAREER DAY.

309
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,921
BUT THIS YEAR,
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN

310
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:40,691
IF WE HAD A GUEST SPEAKER
INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO ME

311
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,593
EXPLAIN WHY
I WANTED TO BECOME A TEACHER

312
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,861
FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME.

313
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,897
IT WAS BY CHANCE

314
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,866
THAT HE'S EVEN HERE WITH US.

315
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:55,706
KYLE BISHOP IS A REAL LIFE
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER.

316
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,744
HE USED TO SIT IN THAT CHAIR
RIGHT THERE.

317
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,713
BACK WHEN HE WAS IN
THE SECOND GRADE JUST LIKE YOU.

318
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,417
SO GIVE IT UP FOR OUR VERY OWN
KYLE BISHOP.

319
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,885
(KIDS CHEERING)

320
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,420
MR. EDWARDS,
I THINK I'M THE LAST PERSON

321
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,822
THAT SHOULD BE GIVING
THESE KIDS CAREER ADVICE.

322
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,023
YOU'LL BE FINE.

323
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,726
JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

324
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,995
AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THEM
TO STAY IN SCHOOL,

325
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,065
AND ALL THAT
AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL STUFF.

326
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:23,901
GO AHEAD, KYLE.

327
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,069
ALRIGHT.

328
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,839
HI.

329
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,847
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT I SHOULD BE SAYING UP HERE.

330
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,751
BUT I GUESS I'LL SPEAK
FROM THE HEART.

331
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,788
UM, WHEN I WAS YOU GUYS AGE,

332
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,057
I FELT LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE
WAS IN FRONT OF ME.

333
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,760
I WAS YOUNG,
I WAS IMPRESSIONABLE--

334
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:54,064
WHAT'S INCESSONABLE?

335
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,699
(LAUGHTER)

336
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,034
IMPRESSIONABLE.

337
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,936
IT MEANS EASILY INFLUENCED.

338
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,738
SO LIKE I WAS SAYING,

339
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:07,945
UH, LIFE IS ABOUT MAKING PLANS
AND SETTING GOALS.

340
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,715
AND WHILE IT MAY BE FUN TO BE

341
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:14,952
IRRESPONSIBLE AND LET LIFE
COME AT YOU FAST,

342
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,055
TRUST ME, THAT'S NOT
THE WAY TO GO.

343
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:21,759
I, MYSELF,I'M A PROFESSIONAL
FOOTBALL PLAYER.

344
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:25,930
AND WHILE THAT MAY SEEM FUN
AND EXCITING AND ALL,

345
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,898
EVENTUALLY, IT'S GONNA
COME TO AN END.

346
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,769
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO RELY
ON EVERYTHING THAT I LEARNED

347
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,705
HERE IN THIS CLASS AND IN SCHOOL

348
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,841
TO TAKE ME TO THE NEXT LEVEL
OF MY OWN LIFE.

349
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,744
SO IN CONCLUSION,

350
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,514
THE NEXT TIME YOUR TEACHER
OR YOUR MOTHER

351
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,050
OR YOUR FATHER, WHOEVER,

352
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,085
ASKS YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP,

353
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,989
REALLY TAKE A MINUTE
TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ANSWER.

354
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,558
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LUCKY,

355
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,828
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

356
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,099
SO, LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS,
LISTEN TO YOUR TEACHER,

357
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,868
EAT YOUR VEGETABLES,

358
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,538
UH, PRACTICE SAFE SEX.

359
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,806
WHAT'S SAFE SEX?

360
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:09,974
MR. EDWARDS: VON!

361
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,149
TEACH, I'M SORRY I WASN'T
A BETTER SPEAKER TODAY.

362
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,952
YOU KIND OF PUT ME
ON THE SPOT WITH THAT ONE.

363
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,021
IT'S OK. YOU WERE FINE.

364
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,023
YOU WERE A LOT BETTER THAN MOST.

365
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,560
SO WHAT'S UP?

366
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,061
WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

367
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,930
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

368
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,565
PROBABLY HIS MOTHER.

369
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:38,035
HELLO, MISS DAVIS.
HE'S IN THE BACK.

370
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,571
AH, I GOT YOUR CALL.
I APOLOGIZE.

371
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,072
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

372
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,112
VON, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

373
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,850
IF I HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE

374
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,084
AND GET YOU
OUT OF DETENTION AGAIN,

375
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,221
I'M GONNA...
THAT LITTLE BEHIND OF YOURS.

376
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,956
ARE WE CLEAR?

377
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:02,226
- YES.
- YES WHAT?

378
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,862
- YES, MA'AM.
- YES, MA'AM.

379
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,030
THAT'S BETTER.

380
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,899
CAN WE GO NOW?
I'M GONNA BE LATE TO PRACTICE.

381
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,871
MM-HMM. I KNOW. OK.
LET'S GO.

382
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:14,972
YOU REMEMBER KYLE, DON'T YOU?

383
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,179
KYLE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

384
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:26,183
HI, FAITH. HOW YOU BEEN?

385
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,954
YOU KNOW
KYLE PLAYS BALL NOW, RIGHT?

386
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,191
FIGURES.

387
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,961
LOOKS LIKE
YOU BEEN BUSY YOURSELF.

388
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,066
WOW, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU ARE STILL THE SAME.

389
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,936
CAN HE COME
TO MY GAME TOMORROW, MOM?

390
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:49,940
HE HAS BETTER THINGS TO DO
WITH HIS SATURDAY MORNING.

391
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,910
YOU KNOW WHAT,
SHE'S HALFWAY RIGHT.

392
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:54,945
BUT MAYBE NEXT TIME, CHAMP.

393
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,880
OK.

394
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,885
WELL, MISS DAVIS,

395
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,655
AT THE PARENT/TEACHER
CONFERENCE NEXT WEEK.

396
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,923
YES, YOU WILL. THANK YOU.

397
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,358
COME ON. LET'S GO, BABY.

398
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,094
BYE, FAITH.

399
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,899
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

400
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,102
LONG STORY.

401
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,338
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

402
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,008
NOT REALLY.

403
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,244
MANNING PARK.

404
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,948
MANNING PARK.
THAT'S WHERE HER SON PLAY.

405
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,351
YOU KNOW, IN CASE YOU EVER
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

406
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,355
SO, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU?

407
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,169
WHO ARE YOU?

408
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,239
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
LARRY ARMSTRONG.

409
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,707
FRIEND OF YOUR MOM'S.

410
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:57,975
OK, I'M READY.

411
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,209
HEY, MOM. WHAT'S GOING ON?

412
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,179
OH, NOTHING MUCH.
I SEE YOU MET LARRY.

413
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,347
YEAH, WE MET.

414
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,915
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO THE CASINO.

415
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,150
OH?

416
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,152
YEAH, SO DID YOUR AGENT CALL?

417
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,286
YEAH.

418
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,755
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

419
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:15,292
LOOKS LIKE I'M-- YOU KNOW WHAT,
Y'ALL ABOUT TO LEAVE.

420
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,727
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

421
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,195
AND WHERE IS YOUR CAR?

422
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,764
IT'S A LONG STORY.
WHERE'S CHRIS?

423
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:24,101
SHE MIGHT STILL BE AT WORK
OR AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

424
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:28,739
ALRIGHT, SO UH,
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE, OK?

425
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,140
HAVE FUN.

426
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,943
WELL, NOT TOO MUCH.

427
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,378
HEY, IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.

428
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,450
VERY WELL.

429
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,753
HEY, MA.

430
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,088
YEAH?

431
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,761
WHO IS THIS GUY?

432
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,129
JUST A FRIEND.

433
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:53,330
A FRIEND.

434
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,331
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE A LITTLE OLD

435
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,767
TO BE HAVING NEW FRIENDS?

436
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:00,170
KYLE, I AM LIVING MY LIFE.

437
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,240
AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME.

438
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,791
KY. COME ON. GET UP.

439
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,160
KY. COME ON.

440
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:26,363
I KNOW. I'M ABOUT
TO GO TO WORK.

441
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,365
ON A SATURDAY?

442
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,100
WELL, THE MORTGAGE
DOESN'T PAY ITSELF.

443
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,035
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

444
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,073
I'M DONE.

445
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,374
WHAT?

446
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,110
I'M DONE PLAYING.

447
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,380
NONE OF THE TEAMS
WANT TO SIGN ME, SO I'M DONE.

448
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,150
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

449
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,219
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
IN THE MEANTIME?

450
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:52,322
I DON'T KNOW YET.

451
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:55,259
ARE YOU GONNA AT LEAST
TRY TO GET WORK?

452
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,195
EVENTUALLY.

453
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:01,398
LOOK, YOU GOTTA GET UP
AND DO SOMETHING, OK?

454
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,300
AND I DON'T MIND YOU STAYING
HERE WHILE YOU FIGURE IT OUT,

455
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,270
OR DO SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE WITH YOURSELF.

456
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:09,106
CAN I JUST SEE WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN WITH MY CAREER FIRST?

457
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:11,208
YOUR CAREER.

458
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,212
UM, I GOTTA GO,
SO YOU MAKE UP THAT BED,

459
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,147
AND CLEAN UP THIS PLACE
BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE.

460
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,183
I AM NOT YOUR MAID.

461
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,322
YOU KNOW WHAT, SWEETIE...

462
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,293
MAYBE THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

463
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,335
SO IT SAYS HERE YOU'RE
A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER?

464
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,270
YES, SIR. I PLAYED FOR 3 YEARS.

465
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:45,442
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE APPLYING
FOR OUR CASHIER POSITION?

466
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,211
I'M DONE PLAYING, SIR.

467
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:50,247
I'VE SEEN
SOME STRANGE THINGS IN MY DAYS,

468
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,450
BUT NEVER A MILLIONAIRE APPLYING
FOR A REGULAR 9 TO 5 JOB.

469
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,253
IS THIS FOR SOME NEW
REALITY SHOW OR SOMETHING?

470
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,889
(CHUCKLES) I CAN ASSURE YOU
IT'S NOT, SIR.

471
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,458
AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU,
I'M NO MILLIONAIRE.

472
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,627
I USED TO PLAY, AND NOW I DON'T.

473
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:07,331
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
I REALLY NEED THIS JOB.

474
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,167
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY EXPERIENCE.

475
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,904
WELL, EVERYBODY HAS TO START
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

476
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,306
I JUST NEED SOMEBODY
TO GIVE ME A CHANCE.

477
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,375
I DON'T KNOW.

478
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,211
SIR, I KNOW
MY SITUATION IS UNIQUE.

479
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,214
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY.

480
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,350
I'M A VERY QUICK LEARNER.

481
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:29,920
IF SOMETHING OPENS UP,
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

482
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,221
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

483
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,191
YEAH. ALRIGHT.

484
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,315
FAITH?

485
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,019
KY. HELLO.

486
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,487
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

487
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,623
I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
SO I DECIDED TO STOP BY.

488
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,025
YEAH?

489
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,393
YOU STALKING ME?

490
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,328
(LAUGHS) NOT AT ALL.

491
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,299
NO, IT SEEMED LIKE VON REALLY
WANTED ME TO CHECK OUT HIS GAME,

492
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,667
AND WHAT I HAD TO DO
FELL THROUGH,

493
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,469
SO I STOPPED BY.

494
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,439
THAT'S KIND OF NICE OF YOU.

495
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,412
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO COME OFF RUDE THE OTHER DAY,

496
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:38,582
IT'S JUST THAT SEEING YOU
WITH A KID THREW ME FOR A LOOP.

497
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,685
WHERE IS HE?

498
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:47,057
HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
WITH THE DIMPLES. (LAUGHS)

499
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,625
- OH, I SEE HIM.
- YOU SEE HIM?

500
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,560
HEY, VON!

501
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,066
MIND IF I STAY?

502
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,402
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY, RIGHT?

503
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,406
YEAH.

504
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,550
GONNA GO BACK HOME.
CLEAN UP THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW.

505
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,386
MAYBE GO TO THE MOVIES. YOU?

506
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,090
I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS.

507
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,659
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT,
CATCH UP A LITTLE BIT?

508
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,361
WHAT, NOW?

509
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,363
YEAH, WHY NOT?

510
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,365
RIGHT NOW
IS NOT A GOOD TIME, YOU KNOW?

511
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,534
NO, IT'S, YEAH, I GET IT.
IT'S COOL.

512
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,402
MM-HMM.

513
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,104
HIS DAD, RIGHT?

514
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:36,573
YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE JUST
COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW.

515
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:41,478
(CHUCKLES) OH, YOU THOUGHT I WAS
ASKING YOU OUT OR SOMETHING?

516
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,579
OH!

517
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,714
I'M SORRY FOR ASSUMING.
IT'S COOL.

518
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,483
WELL, I MEAN, IN THAT CASE,

519
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:50,153
VON'S BEEN AFTER ME TO GO
TO THE MOVIES LATELY.

520
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,455
GREAT GAME, BABY.

521
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,123
THANKS, MOM.
THANKS FOR COMING, KYLE.

522
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,458
HOW'D I DO?

523
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,460
YOU WERE GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

524
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,727
YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

525
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:01,131
- REALLY?
- OF COURSE.

526
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,400
THANKS. OH, MA, CAN I GO OVER
TO CAM'S HOUSE?

527
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,435
I THOUGHT TODAY WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE OUR DAY.

528
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,604
MA, PLEASE?

529
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,440
ALRIGHT. WELL,
WE HAVE TO GO HOME FIRST

530
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,578
NO, MA, CAM'S MOM SAID
SHE HAS STUFF FOR ME TO WEAR.

531
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,413
REALLY?

532
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:19,616
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I GOT HIM, FAITH. IT'S OK.

533
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,617
HE CAN STAY OVER.

534
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,719
ALRIGHT. BE ON
YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR.

535
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,387
TAKE YOUR CLEATS OFF
IN THE HOUSE.

536
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,622
GO HAVE FUN.

537
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,525
BUH-BUH...MMM.

538
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,628
OK, LET'S GO.

539
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,731
SO, ABOUT THOSE PLANS YOU HAD.

540
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,166
SHUT UP.

541
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,434
YOU'RE DRIVING.

542
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,569
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CAR?

543
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,705
OH, IT'S...IT'S IN THE SHOP.

544
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,408
OK.

545
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,512
OK.

546
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,693
YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF?

547
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,196
AH, WELL, YEAH.

548
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,665
THIS KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF OLD TIMES.

549
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,201
IS THAT A GOOD OR A BAD THING?

550
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,703
I'M NOT SURE YET.

551
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,675
WELL, I'M HAVING FUN NOW.

552
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,581
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOURSELF NOWADAYS?

553
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:27,584
I WORK
IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

554
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,521
IS THAT LIKE A TELEMARKETER?

555
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,790
NO. LIKE, YOU EVER SEE THE UM,

556
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:37,227
PHONES WHERE YOU CAN MAKE
THE VIDEO CALLS

557
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,528
ON A BROADBAND LINE?

558
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,664
OH, YEAH.
SOME OF MY TEAMMATES GOT THOSE.

559
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,732
WELL, THAT IS WHAT I SELL.

560
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:47,237
SO IS THAT LIKE A 9 TO 5 JOB,
OR IS IT REFERRAL BASED?

561
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,572
REFERRAL.

562
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,675
HOW DO YOU EVEN
GET INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

563
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:52,909
MY EX.

564
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,547
- VON'S DAD.
- MM-HMM, YEAH.

565
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,650
UM, HE'S A REGIONAL REP,

566
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,819
AND WHEN I WAS IN
MY FRESHMAN YEAR,

567
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,822
I GOT PREGNANT,
HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL,

568
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,691
AND UH, THEN I WANTED
SOMETHING TO DO,

569
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,826
SO HE GOT ME STARTED.

570
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,696
SO HOW IS THAT
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

571
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:15,498
IT'S A GOOD JOB.

572
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,734
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE JOB.

573
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,836
MM-HMM. NOSY. (LAUGHS)

574
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,771
WELL, YOU SAID
IT WAS COMPLICATED.

575
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,540
SO ARE YOU GUYS STILL TOGETHER?

576
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,641
NO.

577
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,644
HE CHEATED ON ME.

578
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,845
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

579
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:33,316
I'M JUST GLAD I FOUND OUT
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.

580
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,851
ANYWAY, ENOUGH ABOUT ME
AND MY DRAMA.

581
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:35,885
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

582
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,654
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

583
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,290
WELL, WHAT'S YOUR LIFE LIKE?

584
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,592
YOU KNOW VON
WANTS TO PLAY, RIGHT?

585
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,695
UH, YEAH, HAVE HIM PLAY
ANYTHING BUT FOOTBALL.

586
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,767
BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, GOLF,
HELL, EVEN HOCKEY.

587
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,302
THEY'RE ALL
GUARANTEED CONTRACTS.

588
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,738
FOOTBALL ISN'T.

589
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,573
BUT YOU GUYS
GET PAID WELL, RIGHT?

590
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:59,776
NOT ALL THE GUYS ON THE TEAM
ARE DOING IT BIG LIKE THAT.

591
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,313
FOR THE MOST PART,
THEY'RE LIVING CHECK TO CHECK.

592
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:06,750
WHAT DOES
AN AVERAGE PLAYER MAKE,

593
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,318
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?

594
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,586
I'M NOSY?

595
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:13,323
DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT TRYING TO
GET IN YOUR POCKETS OR ANYTHING.

596
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,891
JUST CURIOUS.

597
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,760
NO, IT'S LIKE

598
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,796
250,000 IF YOU'RE ON
THE ACTIVE ROSTER.

599
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,897
MM-HMM.

600
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:24,601
80,000 IF YOU'RE ON
THE PRACTICE SQUAD.

601
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:25,635
AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS ON.

602
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,605
I WAS AN UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT.

603
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,006
THAT'S STILL A DECENT AMOUNT
OF MONEY, KYLE.

604
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,708
YEAH, BUT PEOPLE FORGET

605
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,911
THEN YOU GOTTA PAY YOUR AGENT
FIVE PERCENT.

606
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:37,347
YOU GET TAXED IN EVERY STATE
THAT YOU PLAY IN.

607
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,649
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
YOU ONLY GETTING PAID

608
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,851
16 WEEKS OF THE SEASON.

609
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,789
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

610
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:49,392
YEAH. IT'S NOT
WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE. TRUST ME.

611
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,860
I HAD NO IDEA.

612
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,998
SO IF YOU HAD A SON,

613
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,633
YOU REALLY
WOULDN'T WANT HIM TO PLAY?

614
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:59,369
ABSOLUTELY NOT FOOTBALL. NO.

615
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,837
BUT YOU GUYS, MAN, YOU TRAVEL.

616
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,643
YOU KNOW? I HAVE NEVER BEEN
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA.

617
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,712
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

618
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:12,582
YOU STILL WOULDN'T WANT MY LIFE.
I LIVE OUT OF A SUITCASE.

619
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,752
I LIVED IN 9 DIFFERENT CITIES
AND 3 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

620
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,754
IN THE PAST 3 YEARS
TRYING TO PURSUE THIS DREAM.

621
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,689
IT WAS WORTH IT THOUGH.

622
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,624
YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

623
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:24,861
ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS BUY
MY PARENTS A HOUSE AND RETIRE,

624
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,763
AND I CAN'T DO NONE OF THAT.

625
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,833
AND WHY NOT?

626
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,936
I'M DONE.

627
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,912
KYLE: THIS IS THE HOUSE RIGHT
HERE ON THE RIGHT.

628
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,052
THANK YOU, KYLE,
FOR A REALLY GREAT DAY.

629
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:56,059
I MEAN I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH
FUN IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

630
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,070
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE GOING.

631
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,673
YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

632
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:12,976
WELL, YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

633
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,020
AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

634
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:27,690
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME.

635
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,927
I REALLY DID.

636
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,029
WELL, MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

637
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,697
OK, WE'LL SEE.

638
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,802
IF YOU'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING TOMORROW...

639
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,706
MAYBE YOU CAN COME OVER
FOR SUNDAY DINNER.

640
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,010
MAYBE I'D LIKE THAT.

641
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,045
OK.

642
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,014
AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE.
YOU REMEMBER WHERE THAT IS?

643
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,081
YEAH.

644
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,984
AROUND 6:00.

645
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:59,122
YOU KNOW I DON'T COOK.
I ORDER.

646
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,723
(BOTH LAUGHING)

647
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,692
ALRIGHT.

648
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:03,793
ALRIGHT.

649
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,961
6:00.

650
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,129
MM-HMM.

651
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,499
MARIE: THESE ARE MY RULES,
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM,

652
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,067
THEN YOU CAN GET OUT!

653
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,502
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
WHAT I DO, OR WHO I DO IT WITH.

654
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,137
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

655
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,906
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT ME
BEHIND MY BACK.

656
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,975
I HEARD YOU ON THE PHONE
TALKING ABOUT ME.

657
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,945
YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER. I CAN TALK
TO MY FAMILY ABOUT YOU.

658
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:24,881
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU TO.
SO STOP IT.

659
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,082
GOD, YOU'RE ALWAYS GOSSIPING.

660
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,751
- I DO NOT!
- YES, YOU DO!

661
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:32,088
WHAT I DO IN MY PERSONAL LIFE
IS MY BUSINESS!

662
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,858
NOT WHILE YOU'RE UNDER MY ROOF
IT'S NOT.

663
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,125
LOOK, YOU PAY SOME BILLS
UP IN HERE,

664
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,160
THEN YOU CAN TALK TO ME
ABOUT SOME RIGHTS.

665
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,528
PLEASE. HERE YOU GO.

666
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:43,099
MISS THING, YOU DON'T RUN
NOTHING UP IN HERE

667
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:47,537
BUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH.

668
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,105
I SEE WHY KYLE NEVER COMES HOME.

669
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,542
OH, WELL, SO YOU'RE PROTECTING
HIM NOW? OH, PLEASE.

670
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,978
HE BARELY CARES ABOUT YOU
OR ME FOR THAT MATTER.

671
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,079
YES, HE DOES!

672
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,782
DID HE COME BACK
FOR YOUR GRADUATION?

673
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,586
DID HE CALL YOU
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?

674
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:04,988
EXACTLY.

675
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,093
I'M NOT LISTENING TO THIS.

676
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:10,560
I'M OUTTA HERE.

677
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:11,995
BYE!

678
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,603
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, CHRIS?

679
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,105
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

680
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,209
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

681
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,113
O...K.

682
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,020
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

683
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,592
HEY. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

684
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,160
YEAH, WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

685
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,030
WELL, I HAD A DATE TONIGHT.

686
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:49,599
YOU REMEMBER FAITH DAVIS
FROM SCHOOL, RIGHT?

687
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:50,867
WE HUNG OUT.

688
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:51,968
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

689
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,038
UM, DID YOU
TALK TO YOUR FATHER YET?

690
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,607
NAH, I HAVEN'T YET.

691
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,978
FIGURES.

692
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,083
I'M DONE ASKING ABOUT IT.

693
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,918
I'M GOING TO BED.

694
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,701
YOU EARLY?

695
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:35,104
WHY DO YOU SEEM SURPRISED?

696
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,272
COME IN.

697
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,043
YOU LOOK NICE.

698
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,144
YOU, TOO.

699
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:42,945
OH, THANK YOU.

700
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:45,982
KYLE.

701
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:48,951
GOOD SEEING YOU AGAIN.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

702
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,921
WHAT IS HE DOING?

703
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,189
YOU PUT THAT AWAY.

704
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,190
OH, I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST--

705
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,726
WE GIVE HUGS HERE.

706
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,027
OH, OK.

707
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,297
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, TOO, MRS. DAVIS.

708
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,165
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR APPETITE.

709
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,266
I DID.

710
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:05,168
GOOD. RON?

711
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,302
WHERE'S VON?

712
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:07,970
HE'S WITH HIS DAD.

713
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,072
WHAT'S GOING ON, BABY?

714
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:11,074
HEY, YOU REMEMBER KYLE, SWEETIE?

715
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:12,742
HE TOOK FAITH TO PROM.

716
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:14,310
AND HE'S GOING TO BE
JOINING US FOR DINNER.

717
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,211
OH, THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FINE.

718
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,746
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

719
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,181
I'M GONNA GET CHANGED.

720
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,348
ALL RIGHT.

721
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,020
WOULD YOU GUYS COME ON.

722
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,988
GET A ROOM OR SOMETHING.

723
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,324
OH, WE GOT A ROOM. WE GOT ROOMS.

724
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,126
HOW YOU THINK YOU GOT HERE?

725
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:31,194
DAD!

726
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,361
OK, OK.

727
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:41,003
DON'T MIND MY MOM.
THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

728
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,041
SO HOW DID YOU TWO RECONNECT?

729
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,076
WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER

730
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,212
WHEN I WENT TO PICK VON UP
FROM SCHOOL THE OTHER DAY.

731
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:51,180
SMALL WORLD, HUH?

732
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:52,281
VERY.

733
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,284
SO KYLE, WHAT IS IT
ALL THAT YOU DO?

734
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,086
MOM.

735
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,154
WHAT?

736
00:45:58,156 --> 00:45:59,355
THAT IS JUST RUDE.

737
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,524
NO,IT'S FINE.
I'M A FOOTBALL PLAYER.

738
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:03,059
BEVERLY: OH.

739
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,429
I USED TO PLAY BALL.
IT'S COMPLICATED.

740
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,264
I'M KIND OF
IN BETWEEN TEAMS RIGHT NOW.

741
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,099
PROFESSIONAL?

742
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,803
I PLAYED A LITTLE BALL MYSELF
BACK IN THE DAY, YOU KNOW.

743
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,271
OH, HERE WE GO.

744
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,074
YEAH, I SCORED THREE TOUCHDOWNS
THE LAST GAME I PLAYED.

745
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:19,308
SO YOU PLAYED COLLEGE BALL?

746
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,277
YEAH, AT HOWARD.
WHAT SCHOOL YOU WENT TO?

747
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,079
AKRON.

748
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:26,115
IT'S IN OHIO.
RIGHT NEXT TO CLEVELAND.

749
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,819
ALL RIGHT. DOES ANYONE WANT
ANYMORE FISH, CHICKEN, ANYTHING?

750
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,088
OH, NO, I'M FULL. THANK YOU.

751
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,189
I'M FINE.

752
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,290
OK, HONEY?

753
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,025
I'LL TAKE
A LITTLE BIT MORE, TOOTS.

754
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,194
ALL RIGHT.
COMING RIGHT UP.

755
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:40,296
YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TOUR?

756
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,098
YEAH. LET'S GOOD.

757
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,466
LET'S GO. EXCUSE US.

758
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:53,209
WOW, YOUR PARENTS
REALLY HAVE A NICE HOUSE.

759
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:55,077
THANK YOU.

760
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:55,845
THANK YOU FOR THE TOUR, TOOTS.

761
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:57,180
WHAT?

762
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,217
NO. I THINK YOUR PARENTS
ARE GREAT.

763
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,488
I MEAN I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOUR DAD CALLS YOUR MOM TOOTS.

764
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,423
IT'S LIKE
I WAS WATCHING AN EPISODE

765
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,158
OF   <i>THE COSBY SHOW OR SOMETHIN.

766
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,060
OK.

767
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,863
NO, I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF YOU.
I THINK IT'S NICE.

768
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:18,167
I CAN TELL YOUR PARENTS
REALLY, REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

769
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,236
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
SIT AT THE DINNER TABLE.

770
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:23,139
YOU EAT TOGETHER. YOU TALK.

771
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:24,507
DON'T ALL FAMILIES DO THAT?

772
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,376
NOT MINE.

773
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,247
WE BARELY EVEN
TALK TO EACH OTHER.

774
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:32,582
WELL, WHY NOT?

775
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,887
FAMILY IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

776
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,156
I MEAN, I SPEAK TO MY PARENTS
ALMOST EVERY DAY.

777
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:43,259
WOW. WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER

778
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:44,360
REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

779
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:47,263
THEY DO, BUT DON'T
LET THEM FOOL YOU.

780
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:49,465
THEY HAVE THEIR PROBLEMS
JUST LIKE ANY MARRIED COUPLE.

781
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,368
THEY JUST WORK A HELL OF A LOT
HARDER THAN MOST

782
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,137
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. YOU KNOW?

783
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,508
YOU KNOW I WAS LOOKING THROUGH
SOME OF MY OLD STUFF YESTERDAY.

784
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,914
I CAME ACROSS THIS.

785
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,185
OH, MY GOD.

786
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:12,421
YOU...WOW.

787
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:13,623
YEAH, I KEPT IT.

788
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,394
"I WANT TO TELL YOU I NEED YOU.

789
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,529
"I WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I CARE.

790
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,266
"BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
MY EXISTENCE.

791
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,570
"IT SEEMS YOU ACT
AS IF I'M NOT HERE.

792
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:31,240
FAITH/KYLE: "I COULD BE ENOUGH
TO LOVE YOU FOREVER...

793
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,442
"I COULD BE THE ONE
TO SHOW YOU HEAVEN.

794
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:38,948
"YOU COULD BE WITH ME
SO HAPPY TOGETHER.

795
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,384
"FAITH, I'LL MAKE YOU BELIEVE.

796
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,958
WOW. THIS IS UM...

797
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,326
THAT'S THE POEM YOU GAVE ME

798
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:52,495
WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO PROM
JUNIOR YEAR.

799
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,531
IT'S STILL TRUE.

800
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,370
UM...WOW.

801
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,211
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

802
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,668
OH...

803
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:37,273
WITH MY HAND

804
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:43,679
HEY, YEAH

805
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:54,390
IN YOUR EYES, I REALIZE

806
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:58,461
YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME

807
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:06,602
YOU'RE CONNECTED
TO THE AIR I BREATHE

808
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:10,606
WON'T YOU STAY WITH ME

809
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:16,412
STAY WITH ME, YEAH

810
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,396
THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

811
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,502
THAT WAS NICE.

812
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,575
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I NEEDED THAT.

813
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,293
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO APOLOGIZE--

814
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:05,528
DON'T.

815
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,600
JUST ENJOY THE MOMENT.

816
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,639
AND HOLD ME.

817
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,424
GUESS WHO I HUNG OUT WITH
THE OTHER WEEKEND.

818
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,761
I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL ME. WHO?

819
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,397
FAITH.

820
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,698
FAITH DAVIS?

821
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,600
YOU KNOW ANOTHER FAITH?

822
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,437
(LAUGHS) SO YOU TRYING TO GET
THAT OLD THING BACK, HUH?

823
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,773
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

824
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,509
IT'S FUNNY
YOU MENTIONED THAT, MAN.

825
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,878
I ACTUALLY
BUMPED INTO HER MYSELF.

826
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,346
OH, YEAH?

827
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,581
YEAH, SHE STILL LOOK GOOD.

828
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,450
SHE GOT A LITTLE KID
NOW THOUGH, RIGHT?

829
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,651
YEAH. YEAH, VON.

830
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,156
IS THE UH, THE DAD
STILL IN THE PICTURE?

831
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,391
NAH, SHE SAID SHE CAUGHT
DUDE CHEATING

832
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:10,626
AND KICKED HIM TO THE CURB.

833
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,597
DON'T DO IT, BRO.
DON'T DO IT, MAN.

834
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,565
HOLD UP, MAN.
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

835
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,601
WHAT YOU THINK
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

836
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,736
DATING A WOMAN THAT GOT A KID.

837
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:24,206
YOU NEVER WILL BE THE NUMBER ONE
PRIORITY IN HER LIFE.

838
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,208
EVER.

839
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,544
NAH, IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT WITH FAITH.

840
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,846
AND SHE SAID DUDE DON'T EVEN
BEING AROUND LIKE THAT.

841
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,784
WHAT IF HE TRIES TO GET BACK
IN HER LIFE THOUGH?

842
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:38,187
AND YOU KNOW
FAITH IS A GOOD GIRL.

843
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,689
SHE'S NOT GONNA DENY HIM
ACCESS TO HER KID.

844
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,759
HELL, HE COULD CALL HER
RIGHT NOW.

845
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,194
AND SHE WOULD HAVE TO
STOP EVERYTHING

846
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,695
TO SEE WHAT THIS FOOL WANT.

847
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:52,201
MAN, IT SOUND LIKE YOU BEEN
THROUGH THIS A COUPLE TIMES.

848
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,703
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
WHAT I THINK.

849
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,205
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I KNOW, MAN.

850
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:57,573
WHY YOU HATIN'?

851
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,208
I'M NOT HATIN', MAN.

852
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,945
YOU ACT LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW FAITH.

853
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,714
FAITH IS COOL AND ALL.
I LIKE HER.

854
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,449
IT'S JUST THAT...

855
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,820
WHAT, MAN, SPIT IT OUT.

856
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:15,524
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN I SEEN HER,
SHE WAS WITH DUDE.

857
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,629
WHAT YOU MEAN SHE WAS WITH DUDE?

858
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,666
I MEAN THEY WERE ALL OUT
TOGETHER.

859
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:26,535
FAITH WAS WITH SOME DUDE,

860
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,571
AND THE LITTLE KID
WAS WITH THEM.

861
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:29,905
AND LOOKED JUST LIKE HER.

862
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:38,614
WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS LOOKING
LIKE ONE, BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

863
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,622
I MEAN, THAT'S COOL.

864
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:48,657
I MEAN, SHE SAID
HER SITUATION WAS COMPLICATED,

865
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,626
SO I CAN'T BE MAD.

866
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,998
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

867
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,533
EXCUSE ME.

868
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,905
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON, CHRIS?

869
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,610

HEY, SON. (CHUCKLES)

877
00:54:57,328 --> 00:55:00,596
WHAT HAPPENED? I CAME OVER
AS SOON AS CHRIS CALLED.

878
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:01,864
UM...

879
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:05,067
JUST COMPLICATIONS
FROM MY DIABETES, THAT'S ALL.

880
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:06,902
I'LL BE FINE.

881
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,671
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FOOT?

882
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,974
HAVE A SEAT, SON.

883
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,346
THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS LOSING
CIRCULATION IN MY LEGS,

884
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:20,783
AND IF I WANTED TO LIVE,

885
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:23,786
THEY'D HAVE TO TAKE
PART OF MY FOOT.

886
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:26,355
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANYBODY
WHAT WAS GOING ON?

887
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:30,693
WELL, YOU WERE PLAYING BALL,
AND YOUR SISTER WAS IN SCHOOL.

888
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:33,862
AND WELL, YOUR MOTHER,
YOU KNOW HOW SHE CAN GET.

889
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:39,868
YOU CAN TALK TO ME, DAD.
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

890
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:45,841
THE DOCTORS SAY,
NOT NOW, BUT EVENTUALLY...

891
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,611
I'LL NEED A TRANSPLANT.

892
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,615
TRANSPLANT WHAT?

893
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,387
I HAVE CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

894
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,726
OK, SO HOW LONG ARE THEY SAYING?

895
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:10,766
HOW LONG, DAD? MAYBE
I CAN DO SOMETHING TO HELP.

896
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,671
A COUPLE YEARS.

897
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:17,406
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

898
00:56:17,408 --> 00:56:20,843
NO. NO, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO.

899
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,979
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU.

900
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,414
THIS IS MY PROBLEM, KYLE.
NOT YOURS.

901
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,982
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE MY DAD.

902
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,917
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

903
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:30,853
JUST LIKE YOU TOOK CARE OF ME
WHEN I GOT SICK.

904
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,925
NONE OF THIS IS HAPPENING
THE WAY I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

905
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,660
WHAT ARE YOU TALK--

906
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,032
TALK TO ME, KYLE.

907
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,901
DAD, HAVEN'T YOU EVER
WONDERED WHY

908
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,669
IT TOOK ME SO LONG
TO COME SEE YOU?

909
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,974
I KNEW YOU'D COME BY.
JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

910
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:54,042
NO. I DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS.

911
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:56,445
I MEAN I HAD A FEELING
YOU WAS DOING BAD,

912
00:56:56,447 --> 00:57:00,883
HELL, IT'S MY FAULT THAT YOU'RE
EVEN IN THIS SITUATION.

913
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:02,918
YOU AND MOM
WOULD'VE NEVER GOT A DIVORCE

914
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,453
IF I WOULD'VE BEEN A BETTER SON.

915
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:07,723
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE TO
FIX EVERYTHING.

916
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,693
I NEVER KNEW YOU FELT LIKE THAT.

917
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,963
WE NEVER DID HAVE THAT TALK,
DID WE, SON?

918
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,767
LOOK...

919
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,138
NONE OF THIS
IS YOUR FAULT, KYLE.

920
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,875
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND YOUR MOTHER...

921
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,114
WAS JUST LIFE.

922
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:39,054
WE WERE MARRIED
FOR 19 GREAT YEARS.

923
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:40,489
SHE GAVE ME
TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN

924
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:42,858
FOR WHICH I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
AND NO REGRETS.

925
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,494
I'VE LIVED MY LIFE, SON.

926
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:46,762
DAD, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

927
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:47,863
YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE GIVING UP.

928
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:50,065
I'M NOT GIVING UP, SON.
NOT ONE BIT.

929
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,134
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HARBOR FEELINGS

930
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,136
FOR SOMETHING YOU HAD
NO CONTROL OVER.

931
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:58,707
IF ANYTHING, YOU AND YOUR SISTER

932
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,076
ARE WHAT HELD US TOGETHER
FOR SO LONG.

933
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,945
AND WHAT KEEPS ME GOING NOW.

934
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:05,080
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

935
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:08,083
LIVE YOUR LIFE.

936
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,152
AND KNOW THAT I PLAN ON
FIGHTING THIS THING.

937
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,828
LOVE IS THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS.

938
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,732
AND KNOW THAT EVEN IF WE DON'T
TALK FOR AWHILE,

939
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,167
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...

940
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,071
KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU, BOY.

941
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,242
I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD.

942
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,082
WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE THIS THING OUT.

943
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,027
HOW'S HE DOING?

944
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,864
THEY RELEASED HIM TODAY.
HE SEEMS LIKE HIS OLD SELF.

945
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,066
I TOOK HIM HOME AND MADE SURE
HE WAS ALRIGHT.

946
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,803
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

947
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,007
I'M FINE
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

948
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,112
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?
ARE YOUR PARENTS TOGETHER?

949
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:15,150
NO, MY PARENTS DIVORCED
A YEAR AFTER I WENT TO COLLEGE.

950
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,818
WOW.

951
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:22,124
THE ONLY REASON WHY YOUR PARENTS
STAYED MARRIED WAS...

952
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,827
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
IT WOULD BENEFIT YOU.

953
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,131
I SHOULD'VE
SAW IT COMING THOUGH.

954
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:30,999
THEY NEVER WOULD HOLD HANDS.

955
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,901
NEVER WENT ON ANY DATES.

956
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,604
THEY DIDN'T SHOW EACH OTHER
ANY TYPE OF AFFECTION.

957
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,239
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER

958
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,608
THE LAST TIME
I SAW MY PARENTS KISS.

959
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,844
REALLY? THAT'S CRAZY.

960
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:44,913
YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
I'M SO MESSED UP.

961
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,916
YOU'RE NOT SO BAD. MOVE OVER.

962
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,217
UH...

963
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,956
VON, CAN YOU GIVE US
A SECOND, BABY?

964
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,895
YOU EVER GET TO THAT POINT
IN LIFE

965
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:01,997
WHERE YOU REALIZE
THAT EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVED IN

966
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:04,866
IS COMPLETE, UTTER BULLSHIT?

967
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:09,972
LIKE YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE WORKING
TO GET TOWARDS SOMETHING

968
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:13,141
AND YOU GET A TASTE OF IT,
AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU REALIZE...

969
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,979
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH
PURSUING ANYMORE.

970
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,247
THAT'S WHERE I'M AT.

971
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,657
I USED TO THINK LIKE THAT, TOO.

972
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:33,161
BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

973
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:36,031
I COULD BE BITTER
ABOUT STAYING HERE.

974
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,233
ABOUT HAVING VON WHEN I DID.

975
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:41,236
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO FOCUS
ON WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

976
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:44,139
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY.

977
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,908
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THINGS
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER.

978
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,313
KYLE, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

979
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,284
I JUST BEEN THINKING
ABOUT MY LIFE A LOT LATELY.

980
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,988
I THINK I'M GONNA JUST,
JUST GO AHEAD

981
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,923
AND GET MYSELF A REGULAR JOB.

982
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,327
DOES THAT MEAN
WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?

983
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,064
YEAH.

984
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,232
YOU SURE?

985
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,236
I JUST DON'T LOVE IT ANYMORE.

986
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,907
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY
JUST CAME OUT MY MOUTH,

987
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,275
AND I MEANT IT.

988
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,150
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO INSTEAD?

989
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,287
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

990
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:36,024
I MEAN I,
I APPLIED FOR A JOB AT THE GYM.

991
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,393
I'M JUST WAITING
TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM. WHAT?

992
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:44,099
WELL, MY MAJOR IN COLLEGE
WAS COMMUNICATIONS, SO...

993
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,737
LATER ON DOWN THE LINE,
I MAY GET INTO RADIO.

994
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:52,340
BUT HONESTLY, I DON'T,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START.

995
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,477
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO
TO ANOTHER CITY

996
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:57,045
TO START DOING THAT.

997
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,314
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD
TO BREAK INTO THAT IN L.A.

998
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,216
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE HERE THOUGH.

999
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,223
THAT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS LOVED
ABOUT YOU. YOUR HONESTY.

1000
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,758
YOU KNOW MOST GUYS THESE DAYS

1001
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,761
CAN'T EVEN HAVE
A DECENT CONVERSATION.

1002
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:14,296
WELL, IT'S EASY TO BE HONEST

1003
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:17,132
WHEN EVERYTHING
YOU EVER WORKED FOR IS A LIE.

1004
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,205
I DO HAVE SOMETHING
TO ASK YOU THOUGH.

1005
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,440
AND I NEED
YOUR COMPLETE HONESTY.

1006
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,110
OK.

1007
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,347
ARE YOU STILL WITH VON'S DAD?

1008
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,416
NO. ME AND HIM ARE DONE.

1009
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:41,323
I'M SURE. WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME
SOMETHING LIKE THAT? YEAH.

1010
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,792
I ASKED YOU BECAUSE I THINK

1011
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:47,262
THAT WE SHOULD
BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

1012
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,463
OFFICIALLY.

1013
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,369
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1014
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,805
A YES WILL SUFFICE.

1015
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:58,173
YEAH.

1016
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,542
CAN I BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU?

1017
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:02,444
YEAH. PLEASE DO.

1018
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:08,817
I AM NOT REALLY LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW.

1019
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:12,320
OH, THAT, THAT'S COOL.

1020
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,825
WHY?

1021
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:20,162
WELL, FOR ONE, WE SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE THIS CLOSE

1022
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:21,363
BECAUSE OF VON.

1023
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,168
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE?

1024
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,474
I DON'T KNOW.

1025
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,478
WE DO HAVE A HISTORY AND...

1026
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,382
YOU FEEL SO SAFE.

1027
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:47,355
YOU ARE DIFFERENT.
YOU CHANGED.

1028
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:50,358
I GOT CHANGE IN MY POCKET.
I'M BROKE.

1029
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,497
JOIN THE CLUB.

1030
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:59,100
I DID LIE TO YOU THE OTHER DAY.

1031
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,170
ABOUT WHAT?

1032
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:06,107
ABOUT MY CAR.
IT'S NOT IN THE SHOP. IT...

1033
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,478
I SKIPPED A COUPLE OF PAYMENTS,
AND IT GOT REPOSSESSED.

1034
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,382
EVERYBODY HAS TO
START SOMEWHERE.

1035
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,154
YEAH.

1036
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:20,455
YEAH.

1037
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:23,425
IF I COULDN'T AFFORD TO GIVE YOU
THE FINER THINGS?

1038
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:25,527
I MEAN I KNOW
YOU'RE USED TO THAT AND ALL.

1039
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,166
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY, KYLE.

1040
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:34,903
IT HAS NEVER BEEN
ABOUT THE MONEY WITH ME.

1041
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,404
IF YOU'RE WORKING
TOWARDS YOUR DREAMS,

1042
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:41,243
WE'RE TOGETHER,
I'LL SUPPORT YOU.

1043
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:45,313
I JUST...OH....

1044
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:49,284
AS FAR AS US
MAKING THINGS OFFICIAL,

1045
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:52,153
JUST YOU KNOW, GIVE ME
SOME TIME TO THINK IT THROUGH.

1046
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,558
DON'T MAKE ME WAIT TOO LONG.

1047
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,367
YUCK.

1048
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,470
I GOT YOUR YUCK.

1049
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,474
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

1050
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,579
THESE ARE MY LUCKY
RECEIVER GLOVES.

1051
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:21,416
I WEAR THEM AND EVERY OTHER
RECEIVER I KNOW WEARS THEM,

1052
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:24,219
AND I WANT YOU TO WEAR THEM.
I FOUND YOUR SIZE.

1053
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:25,520
COOL.

1054
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:27,389
VON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1055
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:29,324
THANK YOU.
OH, ARE YOU GONNA COME

1056
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:31,326
TO MY PLAYOFF GAMES
NEXT SATURDAY?

1057
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:34,162
IF WE WIN, WE PLAY
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

1058
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,964
I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD, BUDDY.

1059
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,399
I'M THERE.

1060
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,536
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BYE, Y'ALL.

1061
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:44,539
(LAUGHS)

1062
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,207
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

1063
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,545
HELLO?

1064
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:54,282
HEY, KYLE. HOW YOU DOING?

1065
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,184
ADJUSTING.
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF?

1066
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,720
NO COMPLAINTS.
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

1067
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:00,422
I GOT SOME WONDERFUL NEWS
FOR YOU.

1068
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:05,026
YOU HAVE A WORKOUT
IN JACKSONVILLE THIS WEEK.

1069
01:06:05,028 --> 01:06:06,294
IT'S ALL SET UP FOR TUESDAY.

1070
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,595
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHAT?

1071
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:09,564
(LAUGHS) I KNOW.

1072
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:13,268
IT'S A GREAT ORGANIZATION
WITH EVEN BETTER WEATHER.

1073
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,003
WAIT, WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THAT
STUFF YOU WAS TALKING ABOUT

1074
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:16,538
GETTING ADJUSTED
TO LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL,

1075
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,039
AND YOU TRIED
EVERYBODY IN THE LEAGUE?

1076
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,642
(CHUCKLES) WELL, YOU KNOW, KYLE,

1077
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,444
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

1078
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,449
I JUMPED THE GUN A LITTLE BIT.
I APOLOGIZE.

1079
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:30,318
DAMN, MAN, YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH
PEOPLE'S LIVES LIKE THAT, VINCE.

1080
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,588
I MEAN I THOUGHT I WAS
DOING YOU A FAVOR.

1081
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,290
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE YOU WANTED
TO EVEN PLAY BALL ANYMORE.

1082
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:36,591
BUT I AM SORRY, OK?

1083
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,026
AND THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT.
THAT'S IN THE PAST.

1084
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:39,594
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

1085
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:42,397
I HAVE YOU ON A 4PM FLIGHT
OUT OF LAX TO JACKSONVILLE.

1086
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,666
VINCE, CAN I AT LEAST GET
A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT THIS?

1087
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:47,402
WHAT IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT?
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED THIS.

1088
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:50,038
I DID. I MEAN, I DO, VINCE.

1089
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,306
I JUST,
A LOT OF STUFF HAS CHANGED

1090
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:56,277
I NEED...I NEED A MOMENT
TO SORT THINGS OUT, MAN.

1091
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:59,781
KYLE, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY ATHLETES

1092
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:02,350
WOULD'VE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY
THAT I JUST PRESENTED YOU?

1093
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:06,554
I KNOW, VINCE. I KNOW, I KNOW.

1094
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:09,290
MY JOB IS TO GET YOU PAID.
ARE YOU GONNA LET ME DO MY JOB?

1095
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:11,326
SO HOW ABOUT THIS,
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT UP TO YOU.

1096
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:13,061
YOU LET ME KNOW
WHEN I CAN DO MY JOB

1097
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:14,529
SO I CAN BOOK THE FLIGHT, OK?

1098
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,698
YEAH. YOU HAVE MY WORD.

1099
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,566
ALL RIGHT? BYE.

1100
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:25,306
WOW. WOW, WOW, WOW.

1101
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,316
(DOOR UNLOCKS AND OPENS)

1102
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,089
WHAT'S GOING ON, FAITH?

1103
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:43,324
WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
ANSWERING ANY OF MY CALLS?

1104
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,696
RELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1105
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,734
I HAVE MY WAYS.

1106
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,103
AREN'T YOU
GONNA ANSWER MY QUESTION?

1107
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,439
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

1108
01:07:57,441 --> 01:07:59,107
YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

1109
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,410
YOU NEVER COULD LIE TO ME.

1110
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:05,113
WHAT DO YOU WANT, RELL?

1111
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:07,148
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

1112
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,483
WHERE'S VON?

1113
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:09,751
WITH MY PARENTS.

1114
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,554
WELL, WE NEED TO TALK.

1115
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:14,689
WHAT ELSE
IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

1116
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:16,391
WE ARE DONE.

1117
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:19,394
YOU NEED TO STOP
COMING BY MY HOUSE UNANNOUNCED.

1118
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:20,695
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE.

1119
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:21,696
HMM?

1120
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,698
LOOK...

1121
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,500
JUST BECAUSE
I MADE A BAD DECISION

1122
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,135
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M NOT A GOOD MAN.

1123
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:29,671
IT MEANS THAT I'M HUMAN,
AND I MADE A MISTAKE.

1124
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,708
I BEEN TRYING TO DO THINGS
YOUR WAY, FAITH.

1125
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,444
NOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT MINE.

1126
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,719
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

1127
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:48,156
I MADE A MISTAKE, AND I'M SORRY.

1128
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:53,428
HAS BEEN THE HARDEST THING THAT
I'VE EVER HAD TO DO IN MY LIFE.

1129
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,664
NOW I SHOULD'VE DONE THIS
A LONG TIME AGO.

1130
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,701
I WANT US TO BE A FAMILY.

1131
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,405
FAITH DAVIS, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

1132
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,450
LARRY, I'M TELLING YOU.

1133
01:09:15,452 --> 01:09:17,752
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU WENT TO SLEEP IN THE MOVIES.

1134
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,555
THAT MOVIE WAS BORING, BABY.

1135
01:09:20,557 --> 01:09:21,656
HEY, KY.

1136
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,658
HEY, MOM. WHERE Y'ALL
COMING IN FROM?

1137
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,827
OH, ME AND LARRY
WENT TO THE MOVIES.

1138
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,731
I NEVER KNEW YOU
TO GO OUT SO MUCH.

1139
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:31,566
WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW.

1140
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:32,634
(CHUCKLES)

1141
01:09:32,636 --> 01:09:34,569
HERE YOU GO.

1142
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,804
WHY YOU LET HIM
TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT?

1143
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:39,474
AND WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

1144
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:40,808
EXCUSE ME?

1145
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,210
NOBODY ASKED YOUR OPINION.

1146
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:43,645
THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND MY MOTHER.

1147
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,480
YEAH, WELL,
NOW YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

1148
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:48,416
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD USE
A HEALTHY DOSE OF MANNERS, SON.

1149
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:49,784
DUDE, YOU DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT ME.

1150
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:51,519
I KNOW ENOUGH.

1151
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,221
LOOK, LARRY. I THINK THAT--

1152
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:54,789
NO, NO, THIS IS FINE.
MAYBE HE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.

1153
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:58,226
THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY THE MOST
SELFISH PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

1154
01:09:58,228 --> 01:09:59,494
LARRY!

1155
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:01,529
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOUR LIFE, SON.

1156
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,798
YOU ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
ONE OF YOUR DREAMS.

1157
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,501
I MEAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE IN LIFE
GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT?

1158
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:08,770
AND YOUR MOTHER HAS SACRIFICED

1159
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:11,472
FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER SO THAT
YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT,

1160
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:14,275
AND WHAT YOU LOVE TO DO, AND YOU
DON'T EVEN APPRECIATE IT!

1161
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:15,610
LARRY!

1162
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:17,512
I AIN'T GOTTA LISTEN TO YOU.
YOU AIN'T MY FATHER.

1163
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:19,514
NO, I'M NOT YOUR FATHER.

1164
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,482
BUT THE FACTS REMAIN.

1165
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,853
YOU KNOW, LARRY, I THINK
THAT YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH, OK?

1166
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,722
YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH.

1167
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,791
YEAH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

1168
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,494
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

1169
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,635
(DOOR CLOSES)

1170
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:43,738
YOU BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT
BEHIND THEIR BACKS, HUH?

1171
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,640
LOOK, I DIDN'T ASK HIM
TO SAY ALL OF THAT.

1172
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:48,810
BUT SINCE YOU'RE SO CONCERNED
ABOUT PEOPLE TALKING,

1173
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:51,879
WHY DIDN'T YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CAR?

1174
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:55,283
IT GOT REPOSSESSED, KYLE.
DAMN IT.

1175
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:56,851
BECAUSE IT'S MY PROBLEM.
I'LL FIX IT.

1176
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:59,587
SON, IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON,

1177
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:03,024
OH, WHATEVER, HUH? I MEAN
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

1178
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:05,293
WELL, I'M LEAVING TOMORROW
FOR JACKSONVILLE,

1179
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:06,728
SO YOU AIN'T GOTTA WORRY
ABOUT ME NO MORE.

1180
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,864
OH. OH, YOU'RE LEAVING SO SOON.

1181
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:11,866
WELL, DID YOU AT LEAST,

1182
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:13,768
DID YOU AT LEAST
GO SEE YOUR FATHER?

1183
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,869
YEAH, MORE THAN YOU HAVE.

1184
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,304
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

1185
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:17,772
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

1186
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,307
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU
AND YOUR SISTER LATELY,

1187
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:20,642
BUT BOTH OF YOU REALLY NEED--

1188
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:21,776
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY, MA?

1189
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,812
BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE ENOUGH
TO GO SEE HIM YOURSELF?

1190
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:25,880
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1191
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,682
HE NEEDS A HEART TRANSPLANT.

1192
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,821
OH, MY GOD.

1193
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:35,690
OH, LIKE YOU CARE.

1194
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:36,591
OH, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

1195
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:38,793
BECAUSE YOUR FINALLY
WENT TO VISIT YOUR FATHER

1196
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,328
AFTER I BEGGED YOU TO DO IT?

1197
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,897
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT
CARING ABOUT SOMEBODY.

1198
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:44,966
I WILL ALWAYS CARE
FOR YOUR FATHER.

1199
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,768
BUT WE AREN'T MARRIED ANYMORE.

1200
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,703
HE IS NO LONGER
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

1201
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:50,338
NOW I WILL KEEP HIM
IN MY PRAYERS,

1202
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,907
BUT YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARE HIS SON.

1203
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:54,809
AND YOU
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HIM

1204
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,077
JUST LIKE HE HAS ONE TO YOU.

1205
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,646
YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOT TO FOCUS
ON MY OWN LIFE NOW.

1206
01:11:58,648 --> 01:11:59,881
SHIT, I GOT PROBLEMS OF MY OWN.

1207
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:00,882
AND THAT'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM.

1208
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:01,916
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, KYLE?

1209
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,652
SHOW THAT YOU CARE!

1210
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,721
HELL, I KNOW I DON'T VISIT
OR CALL AS MUCH AS I SHOULD,

1211
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:09,357
BUT DON'T MAKE ME FEEL WORSE
ABOUT IT THAN I ALREADY DO.

1212
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,760
THAT MAKES ME NOT EVEN
WANT TO COME OVER AT ALL.

1213
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:16,764
KYLE, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
AND YOUR SISTER.

1214
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,633
AND I LOVE YOUR DAD, TOO.

1215
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:20,034
WELL, THEN START SAYING IT.

1216
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,005
AND YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM
YOURSELF BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1217
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:26,941
YOU SITTING UP HERE
TALKING BAD ABOUT ME,

1218
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:29,944
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING THIS FOR.

1219
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:31,713
IT'S NOT FOR FOOTBALL.

1220
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:34,649
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL
BEING IN THE LEAGUE,

1221
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:35,917
KNOWING THAT MY MOM
GOTTA WAKE UP ON SATURDAYS

1222
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:37,652
AND PULL A DOUBLE SHIFT?

1223
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:39,854
OR THE FACT THAT MY FATHER
IS SITTING IN A HOSPITAL BED,

1224
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,390
AND I CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT IT?

1225
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:44,625
IT'S KILLING ME INSIDE, MA.

1226
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:49,997
I LOVE YOU. BUT I GOTTA
FIGURE THIS THING OUT.

1227
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:53,034
AND IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT'S FOR ALL OF US.

1228
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,837
HOW ABOUT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

1229
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,845
(DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS)

1230
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,783
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

1231
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:13,721
THE WALLS START CLOSING IN
UNTIL YOU JUST CAN'T BREATHE

1232
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,790
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

1233
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:17,792
YOU'RE SPINNING AROUND
SO DIZZY

1234
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:19,894
TILL YOU JUST CAN'T SEE

1235
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,063
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

1236
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:26,701
YOU'RE FALLING, FALLING,
FALLING, TUMBLING DOWN

1237
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:30,805
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

1238
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:33,975
WAKE UP BEFORE YOU
HIT THE GROUND

1239
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:43,985
(PHONE RINGS)

1240
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,056
HEY, DAD.

1241
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:51,926
HEY. SON. WHAT'S UP?
EVERYTHING OK?

1242
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:55,930
YES AND NO.
SORRY TO CALL YOU SO LATE.

1243
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,698
WHAT HAPPENED?

1244
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,667
I MIGHT HAVE A WORKOUT
WITH JACKSONVILLE NEXT WEEK.

1245
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:02,203
FOR REAL? CONGRATULATIONS!

1246
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:03,838
IF EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT,

1247
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,940
I'LL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR MEDICAL BILLS.

1248
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,910
KYLE, IF YOU WANT
TO PLAY BALL, GOOD.

1249
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:11,479
IF NOT, THEN DON'T.

1250
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:12,847
DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU THINK

1251
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,048
YOU HAVE SOME OBLIGATION TO ME
OR SOMETHING.

1252
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,917
YEAH, BUT I THINK I CAN HELP.

1253
01:14:15,919 --> 01:14:17,785
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU.

1254
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:20,721
DO IT FOR THE LOVE,
OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL.

1255
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,767
HEY.

1256
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:36,103
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU.
I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

1257
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:38,072
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1258
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,907
AFTER YOU LEFT,
MY AGENT CALLED ME.

1259
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:41,843
HE TOLD ME I GOT A WORKOUT
WITH JACKSONVILLE.

1260
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,078
REALLY, WHEN?

1261
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,847
TUESDAY. IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

1262
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:48,015
YEAH. YOU GOING?

1263
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:49,984
I DON'T KNOW YET.

1264
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,520
YOU DON'T KNOW?

1265
01:14:52,522 --> 01:14:54,155
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T LOVE IT ANYMORE.

1266
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:57,792
WELL, THAT WAS BACK
WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE AN OPTION.

1267
01:14:57,794 --> 01:14:59,994
NOW THAT IT'S REAL, I'D BE CRAZY
NOT TO CONSIDER IT.

1268
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:06,100
WHAT, BABE? I CAME HERE
TO GET YOUR ADVICE.

1269
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:09,003
MY ADVICE? IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE
ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND.

1270
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,873
BABE, THIS IS A BIG
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME.

1271
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,541
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN BAD
WITH MONEY BEFORE.

1272
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:15,543
BUT IF I MAKE THIS TIME,
I CAN HELP EVERYBODY OUT.

1273
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:16,878
THEN GO.

1274
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,114
WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?

1275
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:23,784
BECAUSE THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
THAT YOU'VE DONE THIS TO ME.

1276
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,221
YOU WERE MY FIRST EVERYTHING.

1277
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,859
MY FIRST KISS.

1278
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:32,927
MY FIRST DATE.

1279
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:34,562
MY FIRST LOVE.

1280
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:36,130
YOU BROKE MY HEART.

1281
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:39,200
WHAT, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO
COLLEGES IN DIFFERENT STATES?

1282
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,204
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

1283
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,143
FAITH, I NEVER KNEW
YOU FELT THAT WAY.

1284
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:51,078
I HAD DREAMS
OF GETTING AWAY, TOO.

1285
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,882
I THOUGHT WE AGREED THAT THIS
WAS THE BEST FOR BOTH OF US.

1286
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,317
NO. YOU AGREED.

1287
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,887
IT'S NOT FAIR. YOU RUNNING IN
AND OUT OF MY LIFE LIKE THIS.

1288
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,323
I HAVE A SON!

1289
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:05,092
FAITH, I WAS YOUNG.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WANTED.

1290
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:07,595
IT'S DIFFERENT NOW.
I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

1291
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,864
I WANT YOU.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED YOU.

1292
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:13,067
I THINK MAYBE I WAS NAIVE
TO BELIEVE YOU HAD CHANGED,

1293
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,268
BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

1294
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,105
WHAT ABOUT VON'S GAME?

1295
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,910
YOU PROMISED HIM THAT YOU WOULD
GO TO HIS GAME ON SATURDAY.

1296
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,246
NOW HE'S GONNA BE CRUSHED.

1297
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,647
FAITH, COME ON.

1298
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:29,016
IT'S NOT EVEN GUARANTEED
THAT I'LL MAKE IT.

1299
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:32,053
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DO NOT
LET PEOPLE GET CLOSE TO ME.

1300
01:16:32,055 --> 01:16:33,921
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND?

1301
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,623
I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

1302
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,825
IF I MAKE IT,
I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

1303
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:43,864
HE'S 7! KYLE, OF COURSE
HE WON'T UNDERSTAND. JUST--

1304
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,834
HEY, IS EVERYTHING OK?

1305
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:47,935
YEAH.

1306
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,638
I'M FAITH'S FIANCEE.

1307
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,073
NO.

1308
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,076
FIANCEE?

1309
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,612
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU, FAITH.

1310
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:00,114
YOU SITTING UP HERE
MAKING ME FEEL BAD

1311
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,216
FOR PURSUING MY DREAM,
AND YOU'RE ENGAGED.

1312
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:04,952
RELL IS NOT MY FIANCEE.
I DID NOT SAY YES.

1313
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,220
YOU DIDN'T SAY NO EITHER.

1314
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:08,089
MARCUS WAS RIGHT.

1315
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:10,024
HE TOLD ME
HE SAW YOU TOO TOGETHER,

1316
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:11,192
AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO BELIEVE HIM.

1317
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:13,227
YOU BEEN PLAYING ME
THIS WHOLE TIME.

1318
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:14,295
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

1319
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:15,896
I AIN'T TALKING TO YOU.

1320
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:20,101
JUST GO BACK IN THE HOUSE.
PLEASE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

1321
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:21,235
YOU BETTER TAKE CARE OF IT

1322
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:23,137
BEFORE I TAKE CARE OF IT
FOR YOU.

1323
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:28,909
WOW.

1324
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,680
HOW LONG AS THIS
BEEN GOING ON, FAITH?

1325
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:35,082
IT'S NOTHING, KYLE.

1326
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:38,052
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY
BACK INTO VON'S LIFE,

1327
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:40,021
AND HE CAME BY
AND PROPOSED TO ME.

1328
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,256
WHEN WAS YOU GONNA TELL ME?

1329
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:44,291
THERE WAS NOTHING TO TELL.

1330
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,894
HERE I AM ABOUT TO CHANGE
MY LIFE FOR YOU,

1331
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:47,928
AND YOU BEEN LYING TO ME.

1332
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,230
THERE WAS NOTHING TO TELL.

1333
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:51,265
I CAN'T CONTROL
WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

1334
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:53,334
HE JUST SHOWED UP, KYLE.

1335
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:56,037
HE JUST SHOWED UP.
IT'S NOTHING.

1336
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,141
I'M OUT, FAITH.

1337
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:01,308
KYLE.

1338
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,947
KYLE.

1339
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,352
KYLE!

1340
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,232
VINCE, I'M IN. SET IT UP.

1341
01:18:35,311 --> 01:18:39,747
OH, NO, MAN. I COULDN'T
HAVE MY BOY ON THE BUS.

1342
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:41,115
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1343
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:43,117
BUS DRIVER, I GOT A DOLLAR,
I DON'T HAVE 1.50,

1344
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:45,052
BUT I GOT A DOLLAR.
CAN I LIVE?

1345
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,121
PLEASE. BUT UH, NO, MAN.

1346

YEAH, YOU WERE RIGHT.

BEING RETIRED AT 25
JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT, MAN.

01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:57,064

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1353
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,739
YEAH, MAN, I SHOULD'VE
SAW IT COMING, TOO.

1354
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:07,208
I WENT OVER TO HER HOUSE
LAST NIGHT

1355
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,776
TO TELL HER ABOUT THE WORKOUT
AND DUDE WAS OVER THERE.

1356
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:10,144
AND PROPOSED TO HER.

1357
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,245
DID SHE SAY YEAH?

1358
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,314
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
SHE LIED TO ME.

1359
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:16,283
I'M GETTING OUT NOW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1360

IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE REALLY

1361
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,356

A HARD TIME, OK?

1386
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,125

FAITH: KYLE,
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T

1391
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:44,531
PICK UP THE PHONE, SO...

1392
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:48,936
I GUESS I'LL JUST
SAY THIS MESSAGE.

1393
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:50,938
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
WHAT WAS GOING ON

1394
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,973
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

1395
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:56,677
THEN RELL CAME BY THE HOUSE
AND PROPOSED OUT OF NOWHERE,

1396
01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:00,214
AND I JUST, I JUST
FEEL REALLY BAD

1397
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:02,149
FOR THE WAY
EVERYTHING HAPPENED.

1398
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:06,220
I KNOW I HAVE NOT GIVEN YOU
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE ME,

1399
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:08,355
BUT I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

1400
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:10,391
FOR MAKING YOU FEEL BAD
FOR DOING WHAT IT IS

1401
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:12,393
YOU FELT LIKE YOU HAD TO DO.

1402
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:17,364
IT WAS EXTREMELY SELFISH OF ME
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD FOR IT.

1403
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,233
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

1404
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:22,169
I DON'T KNOW, IT MIGHT NOT
MEAN MUCH TO YOU NOW,

1405
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,971
BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

1406
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:25,572

THE TIME THAT WE SPENT TOGETHER

1407

NEVER MIND WHAT I WON'T DO

WHEN THE ODDS
ARE AGAINST THE ONES

1445
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:43,110
PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION
AND CRANK THAT STARTER

UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

1459
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:34,628
TO MAKE A DECISION TODAY.

1460
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,197
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE FILM,

1461
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,167
GONNA TALK TO THE HEAD COACH,
AND THE HEAD OF PLAYER PERSONNEL

1462
01:25:40,169 --> 01:25:41,568
TO SEE WHO WE'RE GOING TO SIGN,

1463
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:45,539
IF WE END UP SIGNING
ANYBODY AT ALL.

1464
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:49,176
NOW YOU TWO OUGHT TO BE
VERY PROUD OF YOURSELVES.

1465
01:25:49,178 --> 01:25:50,811
YOU LEFT IT ALL OUT THERE
ON THE FIELD.

1466
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:55,182

HOW COULD I LEAVE YOU
WHEN YOU NEED ME MOST

1472
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:34,788
THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE
IN A LOT OF YOUR LIFE

1473
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:39,693
WHO HAVE TRIED THEIR BEST
TO STAY WITH YOUR LIFE

1474
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:45,499
BUT WHEN I WANT TO SEE
YOU AS WE GROW

1475
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:50,237

I TOLD VON I WOULD
MAKE HIS GAME, SO HERE I AM.

1493
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,536
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR WORKOUT?

1494
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,672
I LEFT IT ALL ON THE FIELD.

1495
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:01,575
OK, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1496
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:03,944
I'M HERE.

1497

FAITH, I KNOW I WAS A JERK.

1498
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:14,721
I JUST SAW HIM STANDING THERE,
AND I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU.

1499
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:19,793
AND MY MIND JUST STARTED FILLING
WITH THESE THOUGHTS AND...

1500
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,762
I GOT JEALOUS.

1501
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,767
IT'S STUPID, AND I'M SORRY.

1502
01:28:26,769 --> 01:28:30,837
VON DESERVES HIS FATHER
IN HIS LIFE.

1503
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:33,674
AND I WAS WRONG FOR MAKING YOU
FEEL BAD FOR THAT.

1504
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:39,513
IS HE HERE?

1505
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,819
HE'S TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY
BACK IN VON'S LIFE,

1506
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,854
BUT TODAY HE TOOK THE DAY OFF.

1507
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,927
I TOLD YOU
I WASN'T GONNA MARRY HIM.

1508
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:56,730
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

WHERE MY LIFE IS HEADED.

01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,942
BUT I CAN'T MOVE
IN A FORWARD DIRECTION

1512
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:11,645
IF YOU'RE NOT THERE WITH ME.

1513
01:29:11,647 --> 01:29:13,680
FAITH, THE WOMAN
ISN'T BEEN BORN YET

1514
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,082
THAT FEELS AS CLOSE TO ME
AS YOU DO.

BEFORE THE STORY WAS HEARD

01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:01,401
JUST LISTEN, BEFORE THE ONES
WHO ACCEPTED A YOUNG EM

1585
01:34:01,403 --> 01:34:04,404
THE FAME REFLECTED WELL
TO THESE GOLD MINING HONEYS
