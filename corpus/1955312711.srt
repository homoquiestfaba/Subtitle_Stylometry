1
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:41,343
Don't.

2
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,012
There's no place for
you in the human world.

3
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,214
I beg to differ, sister.

4
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,118
There is.

5
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:44,439
Gina,
darling, listen to me.

6
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,940
I'm not talk to you as an agent.

7
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,676
I'm talking to you as a friend.

8
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:41,770
<b>SHE WOLF RISING
Subrip: Pix</b>

9
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,009
It's not the right
project for you.

10
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,277
It's not what you do best.

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,114
And you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

12
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,849
Just give me the goddamn
scorsese audition

13
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,284
and I'll show you.

14
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:58,586
You don't
have to show me anything.

15
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:00,222
I know you're a good actress.

16
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:01,554
The best in your field.

17
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,923
Yeah well, maybe
I'm better to move on

18
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:05,559
to a bigger and
better field.

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,860
Darling, I believe you

20
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,262
and I believe in you,

21
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,265
but there's no way I can
get you into that audition.

22
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,466
Why? Because I'm a
fucking scream queen?

23
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,202
What do
you want me to say, Gina?

24
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:16,436
I want you to say
that you'll do your job

25
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,138
and get me the audition.

26
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,507
Excuse me.

27
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:20,909
Do you even have a
photo of yourself

28
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,078
that doesn't have you
dripping in blood?

29
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,114
I have a perfect shot.

30
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,014
God help me.

31
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,849
Okay, put your picture
in an envelope.

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,018
Shit.

33
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,252
Tape
it to your door.

34
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,054
If Pete doesn't see
it when he drives by,

35
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:34,354
you know he won't stop.

36
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,689
Shit.

37
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,390
Sorry darling,

38
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,092
you know he's a pain in the ass.

39
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,061
No, it's 'cause I
just cut my finger

40
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,664
'cause you got me aggravated!

41
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:45,166
B-blood alive.

42
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,634
Shut the hell up.

43
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,069
You know.

44
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:52,240
Just need a new goddamn agent.

45
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,009
Stupid bullshit.

46
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,944
New agent is what I have to do.

47
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,747
Then I'll get good parts.

48
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,487
Shit. Fuck. Fuck.

49
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,822
God damn it.

50
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:16,531
Fuck.

51
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,576
Say hello to your boss for me.

52
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,342
It's like I told ya,

53
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,513
you can run but you cannot hide.

54
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,116
Rufus gon' cut you

55
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,618
side to side.

56
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,492
No!

57
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,298
What the fuck'd you do that for?

58
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:27,601
Fuck!

59
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:29,871
Hahaha.

60
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:30,938
No!

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,007
Fuck you!

62
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:40,014
You dumb twat.

63
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:44,485
What the fuck'd you have
to go and do that for?

64
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,056
Anyway, it's okay.

65
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,358
It's okay.

66
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:54,527
No, it's alright,
everything gon' be,

67
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,331
everything gon' be just fine.

68
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,300
I can still carve you up.

69
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:05,539
Why Rufus, you are one
sick, mother fuckin' puppy,

70
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,708
you know that?

71
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,610
Thank you, Professor.

72
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,778
Hahahaha.

73
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,014
Shit!

74
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,651
Shit!

75
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,387
Shit!

76
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,357
What the fuck are you?

77
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:25,860
You're a fuckin' zombie!

78
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,027
You're a fuckin' cunt!

79
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,964
I know you! You're a
fuckin' zombie, right?

80
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,167
I'm part of
Amy, Professor.

81
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:34,201
Hahaha, fuck!

82
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:37,906
Shit!

83
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,611
Dude, that was so
totally fucking awesome.

84
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,749
I mean, that fucking rocks.

85
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,316
What'd you think of her?

86
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,252
Do you really need to
ask me that question?

87
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,388
If she was vomiting and
had explosive diarrhea,

88
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,823
I still wouldn't
kick her outta bed.

89
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,491
I would climb up into her ass.

90
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,727
I would build a summer home

91
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:01,261
and I would vacation
there on the weekends.

92
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,996
How the hell did you get
your hands on this DVD?

93
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,232
The movie's not even out yet.

94
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,400
I know, right?

95
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,103
Tell me, you fuck!

96
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,205
Trust me, I wish I could.

97
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,438
But...

98
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,941
Do you need me to
punch you in the dick?

99
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,140
Is that what you need?

100
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,744
Alright, you ever
had one of those things

101
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:17,878
where you're not really
sure if you're dreaming

102
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,913
or if it's real?

103
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:20,949
Mmhmm.

104
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,217
You're gonna think I'm nuts.

105
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,717
Dude, I've known you
since kindergarten.

106
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,186
There's no doubt in
my mind that you're

107
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,321
a big ol' fuckin' bag of crazy.

108
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,490
Tell me!

109
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,828
You know you want to.

110
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,061
Alright, I'll tell you

111
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,031
but you gotta promise
not to tell anybody.

112
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,537
Alright, so I was in the
magazine store, right?

113
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,470
And I was tryin'
to distract myself,

114
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,806
get my mind off Allison.

115
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,010
Then, I saw it.

116
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:52,646
Saw what?

117
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,150
The latest issue
of Dude On Dude?

118
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:57,018
You're a dick. No.

119
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,518
The latest issue
of Scream Sirens

120
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,287
with none other than

121
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,390
Gina Skylar on the cover.

122
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,159
Dude, I have that issue.

123
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
I love that issue.

124
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:11,398
Like, that issue could be
the ultimate homo test.

125
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,400
If you don't catch wood
lookin' at that picture,

126
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,103
bing, you're a frickin' homo.

127
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,471
Did you read the
article on the inside?

128
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:20,341
No. What for? I
looked at the picture.

129
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,978
The magazine was
just the overture.

130
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,715
Continue.

131
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,816
As I read the
article, I realized

132
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,885
that there was a lot more
to this princess of darkness

133
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,221
than meets the eye.

134
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:35,590
True, her curvacious
body was the cause

135
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:38,025
for the petrified
forest in my pants,

136
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:39,160
but her eyes?

137
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,527
Her eyes as beautiful
as they were

138
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,598
seemed to be crying
out for me to help.

139
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,367
I clung to every word as
I read her intimate story.

140
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,538
My heart's rhythm changed.
My breathing changed.

141
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,342
Suddenly, the world
seemed different.

142
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,213
I felt lighter and more
alive than ever before.

143
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,853
Something was happening to me.

144
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,156
It was frightening and
exhilarating at the same time.

145
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,925
I wanted and thirsted for more.

146
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,628
I eternally ached for
this euphoric sensation

147
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:15,929
my entire life.

148
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,031
And now the doors have opened

149
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,400
letting in a
fantasmagoric feeling

150
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,403
that I surrender to completely.

151
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:49,964
Thank you.

152
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,337
Do you want me to sign that?

153
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:00,774
That would be awesome.

154
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,276
Awesome.

155
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,678
Do you have a pen?

156
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,649
Hold on.

157
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,085
Hey, can I borrow a pen?

158
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,353
No.

159
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:14,720
What do you think this
is, a charity center?

160
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,024
If you want a pen,
you gotta buy it.

161
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:17,925
If you're gonna write
in that magazine,

162
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:19,360
you gotta buy that shit too.

163
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,729
This ain't a fuckin' library.

164
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:23,531
Thank you.

165
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,432
What's your name?

166
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,367
Jake.

167
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,368
Turn around, Jake.

168
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:33,241
What?

169
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,018
There you go.

170
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,186
Thank you.

171
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,788
Maybe I'll see
you around, Jake.

172
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,192
Hey asshole, this
isn't enough money.

173
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,596
You still owe me 30 cents.

174
00:09:58,966 --> 00:09:59,933
Dipshit.

175
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,639
No fucking way.

176
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,975
Way.

177
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:10,278
I never went home that night
because I lost the magazine.

178
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:13,247
The magazine in which
Gina Skylar wrote,

179
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:14,781
"I'm sure we'll meet again."

180
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,218
Those words vibrated
up and down my spine.

181
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:22,389
I kept thinking about
her and wondering

182
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,460
would I ever see her again?

183
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,133
How are you, young man?

184
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,668
You're Jake, right?

185
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,402
This was unbelievable.

186
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,805
Robert Lonzo, the
biggest producer

187
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,507
of horror films in the world

188
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:42,377
was calling my name.

189
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,380
He's the man responsible
for discovering Gina Skylar.

190
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,215
Yeah, I am.

191
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:49,517
Come here!

192
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,486
I hear you're a
gentleman and a real fan.

193
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:54,588
I guess.

194
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,457
Don't guess, ya either
are or you're not.

195
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,224
No, I am, sir.

196
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,825
Good! Would ya like to get in?

197
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,293
It's been a long time since I've

198
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,096
spoken to a real fan.

199
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:05,931
Don't worry. I'm not queer.

200
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,201
Besides, Gina's in here too.

201
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,239
Sure!

202
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,911
I listened to Mr. Lonzo
as he told his war stories

203
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,881
of how he had to fight
to get the credibility

204
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:22,416
and recognition his
movies deserved.

205
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,084
Under ordinary circumstances,

206
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:26,887
I would have been riveted
in every syllable.

207
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:29,790
But just knowing that
Gina was a glance away

208
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,526
was more than I could handle.

209
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,795
She's even more
beautiful in person

210
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:36,230
than she is on the screen.

211
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:39,166
Hey kid, how would
you like to help me

212
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,901
cast my next movie?

213
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:42,235
Excuse me?

214
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,737
You heard me.

215
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:46,607
I want you to help me
cast my next movie.

216
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,808
I guess.

217
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,343
What would I have to do?

218
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:52,980
Just tell me if you
think the girls have

219
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,649
talent.

220
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:59,153
It's gonna be super fun.

221
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:00,855
Jake.

222
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,806
Never in my
wildest imagination

223
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,778
could I have anticipated what
was about to happen to me.

224
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:33,120
I can't take it anymore.

225
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,023
Why doesn't shit like
this happen to me?

226
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,524
Why?

227
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,293
Why?

228
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,896
Why don't you just go home?

229
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:44,232
I'll catch up with you tomorrow.

230
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,398
No! I'm stayin'!

231
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,834
You're telling me
the whole story!

232
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,437
Woah.

233
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:52,005
Look,

234
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,275
it's pathetic, I know.

235
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:57,745
I got no life.

236
00:12:58,546 --> 00:12:59,647
I got no job.

237
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,783
I got no girlfriend.

238
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,052
I hadn't washed my underwear
in like three weeks.

239
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,822
I need to hear every
single detail of this story

240
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,160
and if you leave out one
mother fuckin' thing,

241
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,329
I'll kill you.

242
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,130
Lonzo told me
there were two things

243
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,699
he looks for in talent.

244
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,735
I think he meant three.

245
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,877
Looking back, I kinda
feel like a pervert.

246
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,585
I watched Lonzo as he
took detailed notes

247
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:40,388
of each girl that went by.

248
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,088
Some of them would dance close

249
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,292
and I could see him hide
his little note pad.

250
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,993
He was a consummate
professional.

251
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,064
I, on the other hand, was
his complete opposite.

252
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,066
I couldn't concentrate
on any of the strippers.

253
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,703
I had only one girl in my mind.

254
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,310
I just had to get outta there.

255
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:05,311
My brain was on
overload and I felt

256
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,314
I couldn't trust
any of my senses.

257
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,683
I found solitude
in the men's room.

258
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,586
Don't turn around.

259
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,254
Listen to me very carefully.

260
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,123
Okay?

261
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,659
Lonzo's in trouble.

262
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:21,528
But, I,

263
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,465
Don't talk, baby.

264
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,533
Just listen.

265
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,836
Lonzo's in trouble
and I need your help.

266
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,574
It's gonna be very dangerous,

267
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,912
but if my gut is telling me
the right thing about you,

268
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:41,549
I know that you're the
right one for the job.

269
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,120
Can you handle it, Jake?

270
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,389
Will you help me?

271
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,523
I desperately
searched for the words

272
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,261
to let her know that I
would do anything for her.

273
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,831
But all that came out
was, "Okie dokie."

274
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,668
Okie dokie.

275
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,604
Really, really love a
man that has no command

276
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,475
for the English language.

277
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,346
So,

278
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:17,851
here's my home address.

279
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,821
My personal number

280
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,425
is in your back pocket.

281
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,027
You call me later

282
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:29,230
and I'll tell you
what we're doing next.

283
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,668
Don't be nervous.

284
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,349
That's better.

285
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,884
See ya later?

286
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,796
Do you have any idea
how good that tongue felt?

287
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,731
No, I'd like to try.

288
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,802
Worked for George Michael.

289
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,249
Goddamn
bitch. Well, I warned her.

290
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,618
Shit.

291
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,189
I don't wanna do all this
fuckin' work for her.

292
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:29,889
Damn it.

293
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,659
Ya know what, this'll show her.

294
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,661
That's it. This is it.

295
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,897
This is the final place.
This is where she belongs.

296
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,932
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

297
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,034
Yeah, I told her.

298
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,736
I warned her.

299
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,673
God, I can't believe this.

300
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,778
I can't believe I'm doing
all this damn work for her.

301
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,749
Should just throw her body
down the fuckin' hill.

302
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,686
Yeah, well no, no, this
is a better place for her.

303
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,456
Yeah, I showed her.

304
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,469
You always were a cold bitch.

305
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:39,794
Shit!

306
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,563
Where the fuck is my wallet?

307
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:49,070
Shit.

308
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,338
This is not happening.

309
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,676
This is not fucking happening!

310
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,463
Where to?

311
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,530
Just up the road a bit.

312
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,634
I don't know.

313
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,735
I'd be grateful.

314
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,507
Alright, get in.

315
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:37,151
So, do you have any gum?

316
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,625
Can I have it?

317
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,436
Where the hell
did you get this?

318
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,237
You tell me where
you fuckin' got this

319
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,173
or you're fuckin' gonna die.

320
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,942
You gave it to me.

321
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,876
You're dead meat, missy.

322
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,282
And what's
wrong with dead meat?

323
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:18,618
Hello?

324
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,456
Gina?

325
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,306
Hey,

326
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,774
it's Jake.

327
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:43,509
Did you just call me or?

328
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,113
Were you just at my apartment?

329
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,682
Did you give
me your phone number?

330
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:50,718
I don't think so.

331
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,120
Did you tell
me where you live?

332
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:54,954
No.

333
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:57,157
I don't even
know your last name.

334
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,759
It's Bubar. Jake Bubar.

335
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,663
Well, Mr. Jake Bubar,

336
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,597
I'll see ya at 10:30.

337
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,298
Do you need my phone number?

338
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,433
I have caller ID.

339
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,604
Well, do you
need my address?

340
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,073
Hello?

341
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,810
That is truly fucking weird.

342
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,079
I thought so too.

343
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,181
My heart raced as I
walked down the hallway

344
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,484
to Gina's apartment.

345
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,519
I couldn't wait
to see her again.

346
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,654
Could I be bold enough to think

347
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,624
that we might have
a future together?

348
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,526
Stop it! I'm way
ahead of myself.

349
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,895
One step at a time.

350
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:39,799
Hi.

351
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,433
You must be Jake.

352
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,368
Yeah.

353
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,204
Gina's told us all about you.

354
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,105
Is she in there?

355
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,108
Don't be silly.
It's just me and Lace.

356
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,020
Okay.

357
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,024
Hey Jake.

358
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,060
Come sit down.

359
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,263
Holy snikies.

360
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,465
She said sit down.

361
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,868
Jake.

362
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,138
This is gonna take a while.

363
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:28,482
Baseball,
baseball, baseball,

364
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:29,615
baseball, baseball.

365
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,120
Baseball,
baseball, baseball, baseball,

366
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,023
baseball, baseball,
baseball, baseball.

367
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,028
I hate you.

368
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,197
I hate you so much.

369
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,365
Do you want me to continue?

370
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,234
I'm so fucking deprived.

371
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,038
Couldn't possibly
get any worse for me.

372
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,739
Well.

373
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,741
Just finish the fucking story.

374
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,852
Having fun, Jake?

375
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,653
What's this all about?

376
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:09,521
They think
you're a hot shot

377
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,624
Hollywood producer
looking for talent.

378
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,992
Why do they think that?

379
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,129
'Cause I told them.

380
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,597
Hurry up, meet me at the
Chinese restaurant downtown.

381
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,267
Fine. Bye.

382
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,973
Girls, I have to go.

383
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,179
You were great.

384
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:35,547
I'll have my people get
in touch with your people

385
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,417
and then they can all

386
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:39,553
touch each other.

387
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,488
Okay.

388
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:48,796
Hey!

389
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,364
Hey.

390
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:51,565
How are ya? Are ya hungry?

391
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,233
No. Just coffee.

392
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,970
Hey Bets. Can I get
coffee for my friend here?

393
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,172
You know we
don't serve coffee.

394
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,239
Only green tea, hun.

395
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
That'd be fine.

396
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:03,576
Green tea ice cream?

397
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:04,978
The usual?

398
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,177
Absolutely.

399
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:06,978
Anything for you?

400
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:07,880
No, that's it. Thanks.

401
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,552
You okay?

402
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,186
What's up with your friends?

403
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:15,088
What friends?

404
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,489
Lace and Gwen?

405
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,491
Yeah, those aren't my friends.

406
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,759
Then why did
you send me there?

407
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,361
I needed to get
Lace outta the place

408
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:24,998
so I can deal with a little
detective work, ya know?

409
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,502
So, you used me.

410
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:30,269
No! No.

411
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,940
My head's just been crazy.

412
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,342
I've been all over the place.

413
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,644
I didn't meant to use you.

414
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,648
I'm sorry.

415
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,318
You said Lonzo is in
some kind of trouble.

416
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,788
What sort of trouble?

417
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,622
Somebody stole the footage to

418
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,124
Vampire Psychos Suck.

419
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:52,426
Your new movie?

420
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:53,558
His new movie.

421
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,361
I was just lucky
enough to be in it.

422
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,965
Unfortunately, it's gone
and it's my best work.

423
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,567
Better than Blood Poison?

424
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,605
I can't wait to see it.

425
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,672
Well, doesn't he
have some kind of

426
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:07,774
movie insurance?

427
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,110
This is a low-budget
world, Jake.

428
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:12,377
We're not a big
company. No money.

429
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,946
No insurance.

430
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,549
Well, why doesn't
he just reshoot?

431
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,784
Because he broke
the cardinal rule

432
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:21,153
of independent film making
and he used his own money.

433
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,489
Now he's flat broke.

434
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:26,358
Thanks.

435
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:27,193
Anything for you?

436
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:28,394
I'm okay. Thank you.

437
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,230
This is his best movie yet.

438
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,600
It's movie gold. It's his
ticket to the big league.

439
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:37,904
Well, Lonzo's lucky
to have a friend like you.

440
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:41,039
Me? I was workin' at
K-Mart when he discovered me.

441
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,476
He came in to buy an
axe for body choppers.

442
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,178
Your first movie?

443
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:46,813
Yeah.

444
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,082
I didn't believe him.

445
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,685
Anyway, 48 months
later, 33 films later,

446
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,322
eight box covers, four
chiller conventions,

447
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,926
I've got a gazillion
members to my website.

448
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,395
Number one scream queen
and I owe it all to him.

449
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:06,066
Will you help me
find the footage?

450
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,504
Gina, I don't know.

451
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,707
I'm sorry. I know it's
a lot to ask. Forget it.

452
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,009
I'm sorry. I just.

453
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,146
You're a sweet guy.

454
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,082
I shouldn't mix you up
in things like this.

455
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,653
Forget I said anything.

456
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,090
You have a little.

457
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,925
What?

458
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:33,961
-On your.
Shit.

459
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,730
I just got my nails done.

460
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:37,931
Would you?

461
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,933
Sure.

462
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,103
You can use your finger.

463
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,937
That way it doesn't set in.

464
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,526
I'll do it.

465
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,760
Whatever you want.

466
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,596
Whatever you need, just ask.

467
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,033
I knew I could count on you.

468
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:40,693
This is great.

469
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,798
I absolutely
love this place.

470
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,231
It looks really familiar.

471
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,433
Yeah? Maniac Warehouse
one, two, three,

472
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,403
and the prequel?

473
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:50,635
Of course!

474
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,904
This is where all the
dead bodies were stored.

475
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:53,839
You got it.

476
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,242
This is great.

477
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:57,977
All that shit,

478
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,111
there's still body
parts in all of those.

479
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,947
But, why are we here?

480
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,981
I got the keys, ya know,

481
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,383
so we could shoot stuff
here when we needed to,

482
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,118
and I thought you would like it.

483
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,387
You're a fan, right?

484
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,522
Yeah!

485
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:10,856
Yeah? Do you like it?

486
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:16,929
What was that for?

487
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,699
'Cause you're
cute and I like you.

488
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,835
Well, that's great to hear.

489
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,571
Woah.

490
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,473
We have work to do, Jake.

491
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,473
Can't always just be about play.

492
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,142
We're detectives
now and we're almost

493
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,179
on the verge of figuring
this whole thing out.

494
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:34,314
Of course.

495
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,816
Sure you're right.

496
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:37,116
Probably.

497
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:40,886
But once all this
detective work is finished,

498
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:43,323
then

499
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,125
Then?

500
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,060
You can have
anything you want.

501
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,331
Are you okay?

502
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,267
Wait,

503
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,636
I think I just came in my pants.

504
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:57,870
Get the hell of my

505
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:58,837
-cushion now!
Nah, come on, dude.

506
00:28:58,838 --> 00:28:59,740
So.

507
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,244
Shit, nobody's supposed
to be here. Come here.

508
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,688
We're not supposed to be here.

509
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:31,471
It's Lonzo.

510
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:34,140
He doesn't look good.

511
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:40,147
Quiet on the set!

512
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:44,183
Roll sound and action!

513
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,585
What's he doing?

514
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,519
Shut up.

515
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,288
Cut!

516
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:50,723
Let's do it again.

517
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,125
Get more blood in there!

518
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,829
I want more blood in there!

519
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:59,365
Make it flow like the piss
at port authorities bathroom.

520
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,167
Shit.

521
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:03,702
Do it now!

522
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:08,875
That's a wrap.

523
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:13,646
That's a wrap.

524
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:29,428
The calla lilies
are in bloom again.

525
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,564
What's he doing?

526
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,700
Shut up.

527
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:36,669
As God as my witness,

528
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,805
if I have to lie,
cheat, beg, or steal,

529
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:42,106
I'll never be hungry again!

530
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,209
As God as my witness!

531
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,044
I think he's lost it.

532
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:45,478
No, he hasn't lost it.

533
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:49,149
A lot of people don't know
that he's a film historian.

534
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,986
His love for art,
film, boundless.

535
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,122
He once told me that he
gets all his strength

536
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,058
through great moments in cinema.

537
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,960
Then, when he hits rock bottom,

538
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,297
he recites lines
from classic movies.

539
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,436
Tonight, as the clouds
are dancing around the moon,

540
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,038
I'll be dancing around you!

541
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,307
You and the moon.

542
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:18,645
You wear a necktie
so I know it's you.

543
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,947
I wish I had some popcorn.

544
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:22,314
Shit's not funny.

545
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,417
He's in pain.

546
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,954
Yo, Mick! What about my prime?

547
00:31:29,623 --> 00:31:31,057
You help me, Polack!

548
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,225
I don't believe you have
the nerve in your body.

549
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,394
Lonzo.

550
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:39,431
I knelt before
the bed of death.

551
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:41,768
No, no, no, no. No.

552
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,603
I knew that there
was but one thing

553
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:46,605
that could bring you back to me.

554
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,141
The scroll of Thor.

555
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:50,375
No, don't do that.

556
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,344
What is it?

557
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:53,079
I'm a scream queen, you idiot.

558
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:54,780
So?

559
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,383
And so I dare the God's anger

560
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:58,784
and stole it.

561
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:00,553
I'm a true scream queen.

562
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,522
I hear lines recited
from famous hor,

563
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,057
horror films.

564
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,026
They broke in on me

565
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:11,131
and found me doing
an unholy thing.

566
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:12,532
God.

567
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,402
Tie my hands up.

568
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:16,169
What?

569
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,336
Tie my hands up!

570
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,405
They're
coming for you, Barbara.

571
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,806
Look! There's one of them now!

572
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:22,975
Shit!

573
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,877
Take my pants off
and tie up my legs.

574
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:26,913
Shit.

575
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:29,649
Hurry!

576
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:35,020
The spider spinning the
web for the unworthy fly.

577
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,423
Tighter. Tie
it fuckin' tighter.

578
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,826
Now put something in my mouth.

579
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:45,764
I am gonna learn
every frickin' word

580
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:47,233
to Halloween two.

581
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,034
Put something in my mouth.

582
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,236
What?

583
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,070
Put your goddamn
shirt in my mouth!

584
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,906
Take it off and put it
in my fuckin' mouth.

585
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,741
Now! Hurry up!

586
00:32:58,178 --> 00:33:01,915
The blood is the
life, Mr. Renfield.

587
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:03,283
Okay?

588
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:08,453
Even the man
who's pure at heart

589
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,956
and says his prayers at night

590
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,663
can become a wolf when
the woofbane blooms.

591
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:21,600
The Autumn moon is
pure and bright.

592
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,573
'Tis a lovely day
for an exorcism!

593
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:43,223
I'll be right back, okay?

594
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:47,694
Gina,

595
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,695
I'll be right back.

596
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:52,898
Mr. Lonzo.

597
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:54,933
Fuck!

598
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,839
This is gettin'
better every minute.

599
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,609
What the fuck happened next?

600
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:05,377
Mr. Lonzo, are you alright?

601
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:10,250
Auntie Em, there's
no place like home.

602
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:12,684
You're gonna be
alright, Mr. Lonzo.

603
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:18,525
Gina?

604
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:20,659
Gina?

605
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:33,739
Mr. Lonzo?

606
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,911
Okay, okay.

607
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,282
This is one of
those reality shows.

608
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,585
I just need to figure out where
all the camera's are hidden.

609
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:47,820
Okay, I get it!

610
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:50,623
I get it. You can tell me
where the camera's are now.

611
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,560
Okay, this is a little creepy.

612
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:57,396
Just listen to your inner voice.

613
00:34:57,797 --> 00:34:59,499
What would your inner
voice tell you to do?

614
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:06,206
Get the fuck out.

615
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:19,219
Gina?

616
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:26,526
Gina?

617
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,196
Gina?

618
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,302
And where are you from?

619
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:39,705
I resemble that remark.

620
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:41,307
But, never you mind, you swine.

621
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,274
I'd horsewhip you
if I had a horse.

622
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,942
Now, down to business.

623
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:48,046
Say the secret word and the
girl of your dreams will appear.

624
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:49,247
What?

625
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,216
Wrong word but,
don't worry, be happy.

626
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:54,085
We have a constellation
prize for you.

627
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,555
The girl of your nightmares!

628
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:58,422
And here she is

629
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,957
fresh from the crypt,

630
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,959
fully loaded with
chewed up maggots

631
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,595
and rotting flesh,

632
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:06,365
dadadadadadaaaa!

633
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:10,803
It's Lillian!

634
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:14,805
Lillian, Lillian.

635
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,241
Have you screwed Lillian?

636
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:21,213
Lillian, the creepy lady?

637
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:30,988
Well, I can see that the
two of you want to be alone.

638
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,024
No, don't!

639
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,425
I'll be on my way.

640
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:34,894
No, don't!

641
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:37,630
Let's get nasty.

642
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,371
Woah.

643
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,539
I need to watch a Disney movie.

644
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:56,983
Who is it?

645
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:00,853
Hey.

646
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,655
Are you okay?

647
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,558
What happened to you? I
was worried about you.

648
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,060
You know how happy I am

649
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,596
that you've been
helping me with this?

650
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,400
You're amazing.

651
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:19,906
But I have to do the
rest of this on my own.

652
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,774
Are you crazy?

653
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:24,942
Listen, I promised you
that I was gonna help you.

654
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,245
And I'm not backing down until

655
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,314
we recover that missing footage.

656
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,516
I appreciate that.

657
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:33,719
But

658
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:37,724
I'm a scream queen.

659
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,961
It doesn't matter
to me what you are.

660
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,264
I care about you.

661
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,003
You pussy whooped bastard.

662
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,771
What would you have done?

663
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:53,772
Well I,

664
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:56,541
alright, go on.

665
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,346
I'll be careful. I promise.

666
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,648
Now let's come up with a plan.

667
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:06,085
I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

668
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:09,855
If someone's following
you or trying to stop you,

669
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,057
then you're definitely
not the right person

670
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:13,025
to be handling
this investigation.

671
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:16,295
You sound so official.

672
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:19,265
Just give me a hit list

673
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:21,134
of all your potential
suspects, okay?

674
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,334
I'll do what I did with
Gwen and her friend.

675
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,803
I'll follow them and
then, at the right moment,

676
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:25,972
I'll question them.

677
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:28,607
Yeah, that
actually could work.

678
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,109
I mean, you could say that
you're doing an interview

679
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,777
for like Sirens of Cinema or
Fango or something like that.

680
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:34,712
And if I tell them that
I've already interviewed you,

681
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,080
that'll give me
instant credibility

682
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,116
and maybe they'll
loosen up a little bit.

683
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:40,153
My hero.

684
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:48,760
I think we should wait.

685
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,163
Til all this is done.

686
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,532
Ya know, til we,

687
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,866
go to the next level.

688
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,036
Whatever you say, boss.

689
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,576
Wait. Wait a minute.

690
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:06,679
I just realized something.

691
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,848
Gina Skylar was standing here

692
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,084
in this apartment.

693
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,085
Yeah. So?

694
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:14,052
So?

695
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,824
I think I can, I can,

696
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,493
she sat on this
couch, didn't she?

697
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,829
I think I can taste
her in my mouth.

698
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:25,763
I can, she's actually
in my mouth right now.

699
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:26,531
Dude.

700
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,698
It's delicious.

701
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,333
Dude, you really
gotta get a girlfriend.

702
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,501
Eat me.

703
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:31,870
Gina kept
referring to herself

704
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,773
as a true scream queen, which
would get her very distressed.

705
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,509
So, I searched the
libraries and internet

706
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,645
and the only item I found
that made any reference

707
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:43,114
was a screenplay titled,
"The True Scream Queen".

708
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:45,517
A script that was
optioned by Robert Lonzo,

709
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:47,019
but never made.

710
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,422
Now this was getting weird.

711
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,624
I was able to get some
info about the writer,

712
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,058
Kiara Lupanel.

713
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,660
She had a bestselling
novel published

714
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:59,264
when she was 16 and had
written seven movies for Lonzo.

715
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:02,668
This was way freaky, but
I knew I had to see her.

716
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:05,270
I called her using the
guise of being a writer

717
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:07,940
doing an article about her
and she agreed to see me.

718
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,040
But once I arrived at her home,

719
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,676
well let's just say I
wasn't exactly prepared

720
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,346
for what was waiting for me.

721
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,608
Kiara.

722
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:50,742
Mr. Bubar?

723
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:51,876
Yes.

724
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:52,845
It's a true pleasure to meet

725
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,645
another artist of the pen.

726
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:55,946
You flatter me.

727
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,314
I'm not even close to
being in your league.

728
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,850
I won't hold it against you

729
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,019
as long as you
don't disappoint me.

730
00:42:03,456 --> 00:42:05,358
You're much younger
than I thought you'd be.

731
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,692
And more beautiful.

732
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,697
She sleeps.

733
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,666
Rem?

734
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,701
Leave us for now.

735
00:42:35,788 --> 00:42:36,923
Nice dress.

736
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,622
I absolutely adore dressing up

737
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,625
as the characters I write about.

738
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,261
Should we move
away from the chair?

739
00:42:43,262 --> 00:42:44,864
I don't wanna wake her.

740
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:46,998
She sleeps like the death.

741
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:48,966
Is she part vampire?

742
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,303
Don't make jokes
about my Mother.

743
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,239
She can get quite angry.

744
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,175
You may begin your
interview now.

745
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:59,278
Alright, why does
a writing prodigy

746
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,346
put her novels on hold to write,

747
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:04,750
forgive me, B horror
films for Robert Lonzo?

748
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:07,286
Is that really what
you want to ask me?

749
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:10,755
Then, I shall indulge you.

750
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,992
I live through the
characters I write about.

751
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:17,296
Their hopes, fears,
passions are all mine.

752
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,865
A few years ago, you
wrote a screenplay.

753
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,735
The True Scream Queen.

754
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,803
Robert Lonzo optioned it but
the movie was never made.

755
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:28,239
Someone's been
doing their homework.

756
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,977
He produced seven of your
scripts, but not that one.

757
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:35,047
And why is this of
such great importance to you?

758
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:37,582
I have a friend and she says

759
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,184
she's a true scream queen.

760
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:42,053
A young, aspiring
actress looking to

761
00:43:42,054 --> 00:43:44,490
break into movies through
the horror corridor.

762
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,091
No, nothing like that.

763
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:47,660
Gina's a superstar.

764
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:50,729
Gina? Gina Skylar?

765
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,731
Yeah. Do you know her?

766
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,100
That movie will never be
made. Mother forbids it.

767
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:57,469
Please tell me more.

768
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,538
I have to know what is
a true scream queen?

769
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:02,741
Something you
need to be far away from.

770
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:03,676
Please.

771
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,244
I think I'm in love with her.

772
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,384
Are you familiar with the
story of Romulus and Remus?

773
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,719
Didn't they
nurse from some wolf?

774
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:18,156
Not some wolf, Mr. Bubar.

775
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:20,026
The she-wolf, Lupa.

776
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,094
The true mother of Rome.

777
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:24,995
She nursed the twins and
saved them from peril.

778
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,464
When the boys grew up, the
wolf would take human form

779
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:29,267
and protect and guide them.

780
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:31,569
Without her, there
would be no Rome,

781
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,572
no Caesar, no glory!

782
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,307
How does that relate
to a true scream queen?

783
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,543
Their lineage is connected.

784
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:41,680
They share similar
traits because they're

785
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,449
from the same source.

786
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:46,084
The she-wolf is
motivated to protect

787
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:47,753
and nurture the helpless.

788
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,355
When she rises up and
changes from wolf to human,

789
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,625
she has a rational side
and a kind, gentle heart

790
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:56,795
that cares and loves.

791
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:00,131
Contrary, the scream
queens transmutation

792
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:01,966
from human to wolf,

793
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:06,270
or better yet demon,
loses all reason, purpose,

794
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,538
and compassion.

795
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,441
Even if that is true,
she would never hurt me.

796
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:10,841
We have feelings
for one another.

797
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,576
She might have
feelings for you,

798
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,913
but the beast does not.

799
00:45:14,914 --> 00:45:17,383
Why are you saying beast?
She's absolutely beautiful.

800
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,951
The belladonna
plant is beautiful.

801
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:23,422
It's also the deadliest plant
in the Northern hemisphere.

802
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:25,556
Say that it is true.

803
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:28,026
What could make her
change? A full moon?

804
00:45:28,027 --> 00:45:30,595
This is not a horror
movie, Mr. Bubar.

805
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:31,996
It's reality.

806
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:33,864
I don't understand.

807
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:36,068
Every she-wolf
has their trigger.

808
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:37,970
It's ingrained at a young age

809
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:40,705
and when that trigger is
pulled, no one is safe.

810
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:41,606
So, you're telling me that,

811
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,641
Be cautious, Mr. Bubar.

812
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,544
Rem?

813
00:45:48,614 --> 00:45:50,316
Show Mr. Bubar out.

814
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,278
I cannot believe he's in
love with her. It's not fair!

815
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,249
Bellisima.

816
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:27,384
Why does Gina get to walk
in the world of gardens

817
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,920
that I write about?

818
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,090
Do you think
I love her more than you?

819
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:42,701
Will Gina ever come home?

820
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:48,073
I don't know.

821
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,391
I must get back to work.

822
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,634
Say the secret
word and the girl

823
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:51,270
of your dreams will appear.

824
00:48:53,565 --> 00:48:55,400
Let's get nasty.

825
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:19,057
The heart becomes
salvage, Mr. Bubar.

826
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:22,695
The heart becomes
salvage.

827
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,613
I spent
the next two days

828
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,416
interviewing Lonzo's crew.

829
00:49:46,085 --> 00:49:48,420
I was astonished at
how happy they all were

830
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:50,388
given the fact that most of them

831
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:52,691
lived just above
the poverty level.

832
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,530
Just a creepy old car,
Jake. No big deal. Right?

833
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,068
What a creepy old car.

834
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:08,807
Harry?

835
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:10,208
Yeah?

836
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:12,043
I'm Jake.

837
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:13,378
Have a seat, Jake.

838
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:19,485
Would you like some?

839
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,720
I'm good.

840
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:24,389
I've already eaten
lunch, but thank you.

841
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:28,727
Ya know, at first,

842
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:30,729
I didn't like sardines.

843
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:33,163
I didn't even like
the name sardines,

844
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:34,867
especially the way they smelled.

845
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,204
I'm sorry. Takes a
while to get used to.

846
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:43,140
But when you do,
they're like a woman.

847
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:44,643
You can't get enough.

848
00:50:44,943 --> 00:50:47,312
And you always want more,
you know what I'm sayin'?

849
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:51,784
I actually just have
a couple questions.

850
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:54,151
On the last day
of Lonzo's shoot,

851
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:56,754
you were the one to put
away the equipment, right?

852
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:59,357
Yeah, I was there but,

853
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,225
Mr. Lonzo told me
to leave early.

854
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:03,528
So you weren't
the last one to leave?

855
00:51:03,996 --> 00:51:05,130
No.

856
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:08,598
Ya know, after
one of our shoots,

857
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,804
Mr. Lonzo gave me
two whole cases.

858
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:13,437
He couldn't pay us

859
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,172
'cause the distributors
check bounced.

860
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,409
And he wanted to make sure
we got enough protein.

861
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,377
You know how much
protein there is

862
00:51:19,378 --> 00:51:21,246
in one can of sardines?

863
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,780
No.

864
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,784
More than three
whole steaks. Yes sir.

865
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:31,156
I love that guy. He cares so
much about the little people.

866
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:32,958
You sure you don't want any?

867
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,625
I, I'm okay.

868
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:35,993
I'm okay, thanks.

869
00:51:35,994 --> 00:51:38,363
Put hair on your chest.
Lead in your pencil.

870
00:51:38,364 --> 00:51:42,732
Actually, I think
that's all I need but,

871
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:43,968
it was great meeting you.

872
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:45,535
Thank you so much
for meeting with me.

873
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:46,471
Take care.

874
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:47,439
You too.

875
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,609
Yeah.

876
00:52:20,606 --> 00:52:22,341
Miss Bell?

877
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:25,676
Call me Flame.

878
00:52:27,012 --> 00:52:28,212
Hi, I'm Jake.

879
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:30,082
I know. The guy
from the magazine?

880
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,281
That's right.

881
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:32,183
I hope you don't
mind if I continue

882
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:33,651
my workout while we talk.

883
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:35,586
Otherwise, I'll
never get it done.

884
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:37,655
No, of course.

885
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,024
I hope these questions
aren't gonna be too personal.

886
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,727
I got interviewed once by a guy

887
00:52:42,728 --> 00:52:44,562
pretending to be
from a magazine.

888
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:46,898
He turned out to
be some pervert.

889
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,500
What happened?

890
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,201
I dropped a bar
bell on his crotch.

891
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:52,336
Last I heard, he
became a candidate

892
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,905
for a sex change operation.

893
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:59,644
Don't worry. You have
nothing to be afraid of.

894
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:03,382
Besides, you're kinda cute.

895
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:05,583
Do you have a girlfriend?

896
00:53:05,784 --> 00:53:07,619
What?

897
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:09,820
Rawr.

898
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:14,792
It's okay. I can handle it.

899
00:53:18,297 --> 00:53:19,798
Hey, can you do me a favor?

900
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:21,199
Sure, if I can.

901
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,100
I wanna make sure I'm
doing really good push ups.

902
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,671
So, can you just put your hand

903
00:53:26,672 --> 00:53:29,374
on the floor and make sure my
chest touches it each time?

904
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:31,341
The floor?

905
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:34,245
No, silly, your hand.

906
00:53:40,485 --> 00:53:42,752
What did I do in
my life to deserve

907
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:45,288
to be subjected to these
thoughts and images

908
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,159
that torture my young soul?

909
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,393
Even Buddha got to touch
more tit than this.

910
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,230
I just see these films
as a stepping stone

911
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:55,132
to my final career plateau.

912
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,802
Well, what
is that plateau?

913
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,871
Playboy magazine, of course.

914
00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:07,444
Can you be completely
honest with me?

915
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:08,614
Sure.

916
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:10,382
Tell me what you
think of these.

917
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,920
I mean, do you think
they're Playboy material?

918
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,324
I can do this. I can do this.

919
00:54:20,259 --> 00:54:21,559
I can do this.

920
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:23,127
I mean, they're
really n..., they look...

921
00:54:23,128 --> 00:54:24,096
Do you want to feel them?

922
00:54:30,802 --> 00:54:33,704
Actually, I just
had one question.

923
00:54:34,172 --> 00:54:35,840
Don't bother. They're real.

924
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:39,576
That's not what
I was gonna ask but,

925
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:40,578
good for you.

926
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:41,780
Thank you.

927
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:45,250
Why weren't you at
Lonzo's last wrap party?

928
00:54:47,152 --> 00:54:48,619
That's a weird question.

929
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,289
I'll tell you

930
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,659
but then I'm gonna
have to kill you.

931
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,359
What?

932
00:54:55,827 --> 00:54:58,297
I'm only kidding.

933
00:54:59,331 --> 00:55:00,363
It's okay.

934
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,832
So anyway.

935
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:04,535
I've had to make a wee wee
for like an hour and a half

936
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:06,270
and I'm not leaving this room

937
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:10,509
until I hear every single
detail of that story.

938
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:14,078
If I gotta piss in
my pants, so be it.

939
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:14,980
Okay.

940
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:16,212
I'll tell you everything.

941
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,181
But I swear to God, if
you pee on my floor,

942
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:19,885
I'm never talking to you again.

943
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:21,052
Okay.

944
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,255
You got any more chips?

945
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,857
I was down to the
last person on Gina's list.

946
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:28,960
An old timer named
Charlie Graves.

947
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,697
Mr. Graves?

948
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:32,596
Youngblood.

949
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:33,265
Hi.

950
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:34,266
Have a seat.

951
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:35,367
Thank you.

952
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,605
Here, take a look at that.

953
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:44,774
Is that you?

954
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,243
I was a handsome
devil, wasn't I?

955
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:51,516
Mr. Graves, is that Thomas
Edison in the picture with you?

956
00:55:54,152 --> 00:55:56,319
Exactly how long have
you been in the business?

957
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,456
Not long enough.

958
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,391
I still have a few

959
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:01,827
purty movies left in me but,

960
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:04,862
I don't know if I'm gonna last.

961
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,299
Until I get some.

962
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,034
Unless what?

963
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:13,938
I get some young!

964
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,483
Yeah, funny.

965
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,652
I didn't scare you
too much, did I?

966
00:56:28,286 --> 00:56:31,056
No. Not at all.

967
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:34,459
It's alright, kid. We're
all scared of something.

968
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:36,628
Fear.

969
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,263
It lets you know you're
alive and makes your

970
00:56:39,264 --> 00:56:41,633
heart race and your blood pump.

971
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:44,368
It's the next best thing to sex.

972
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:47,672
Why do you think so many people
watch scary movies?

973
00:56:48,507 --> 00:56:50,642
I guess I never
thought of it that way.

974
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:53,412
When you've been around
as long as I've been,

975
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,448
you see things a whole new way.

976
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:01,619
One's vision and take
on things become clear.

977
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:10,796
-Can I ask you one last question?
-Go right ahead, young blood.

978
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:14,432
Is there such a thing
as a true scream queen?

979
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,168
Where did you hear that?

980
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:18,470
Who told you about that?

981
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:21,940
Where did you hear that?

982
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:23,542
I just heard some people.

983
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:25,509
Now, that's some bullshit.

984
00:57:28,346 --> 00:57:29,747
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

985
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:31,349
I'll answer your question.

986
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:33,951
It's a myth.

987
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:37,422
But I thought.

988
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:38,990
But that's all I got to say.

989
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,293
It's a myth.

990
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,865
Well, thank you very
much for meeting with me.

991
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,268
I appreciate you
taking the time.

992
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:54,004
It was nice meeting you.

993
00:57:54,005 --> 00:57:56,141
And remember one
thing, young blood.

994
00:57:57,275 --> 00:57:59,744
Charlie Graves doesn't lie.

995
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,084
It's a myth.

996
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:10,588
It's a myth.

997
01:00:37,702 --> 01:00:38,835
My God.

998
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:39,637
That was the
best fun of my day.

999
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:40,703
It was awesome!

1000
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:43,974
My God.

1001
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:48,746
I have, I have the best
time when I'm with you.

1002
01:00:49,014 --> 01:00:49,948
Me too.

1003
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:51,582
With yourself?

1004
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,951
No, with you.

1005
01:00:53,952 --> 01:00:56,488
Dumb actress. Can't
do stuff like that.

1006
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,232
It's Lonzo.

1007
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:10,702
Hey.

1008
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:15,606
No, please don't say
that. It's not over.

1009
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:17,741
That's a wrap.

1010
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:19,977
Lonzo, please, just trust me.

1011
01:01:19,978 --> 01:01:21,246
We'll get it figured out.

1012
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:23,381
Yes, we will.

1013
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:28,920
Hello?

1014
01:01:37,896 --> 01:01:39,330
I'm so sorry.

1015
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,400
What?

1016
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:45,135
I let you down.

1017
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:48,406
You didn't let me down.

1018
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,875
You're crazy.

1019
01:01:51,543 --> 01:01:53,576
You're the only person that
I've ever known in my life

1020
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,746
that would risk their
own safety for me.

1021
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:58,248
That's pretty awesome.

1022
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,740
I'm sorry.

1023
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:24,674
I shouldn't have done that.

1024
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:25,809
Yeah, you shouldn't have.

1025
01:02:26,478 --> 01:02:28,680
I love this art work.

1026
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,282
Yeah.

1027
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,952
It's always about good box art.

1028
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:37,154
Not when you're in them.

1029
01:02:39,657 --> 01:02:41,860
You really are a fan?

1030
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:46,697
Hey.

1031
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:50,399
Who's Tony Boca and why
haven't we checked him out?

1032
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,568
Tony

1033
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:53,569
produced a bunch
of Lonzo's movies

1034
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,439
back in the day and

1035
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,672
kinda got bored with
it all, I think.

1036
01:02:56,673 --> 01:02:59,409
He retired and he
owns car washes now.

1037
01:02:59,978 --> 01:03:02,146
Well, we have to follow
up with every suspect.

1038
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,913
Not that guy.

1039
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:05,415
No way. Forget about it.

1040
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:08,086
He grew up with Lonzo.
They were best friends.

1041
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:09,887
He would never hurt him.

1042
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:11,722
Well, who else is left?

1043
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:14,992
Doesn't hurt, right?

1044
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:20,798
His place is like two
miles down the road.

1045
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:47,659
Lonzo!

1046
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,060
That was his car.

1047
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,530
Lonzo! Lonzo.

1048
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:56,166
Lonzo!

1049
01:03:56,601 --> 01:03:57,868
Lonzo.

1050
01:03:57,869 --> 01:03:59,537
Little late for a car
wash, don't ya think?

1051
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:01,773
Why would you do this to
him? He was your friend.

1052
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:04,006
He cut me off
for no good reason.

1053
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,576
No. You retired.

1054
01:04:05,577 --> 01:04:07,444
No, no.
He got rid of me.

1055
01:04:07,445 --> 01:04:08,680
This business
is full of rejection.

1056
01:04:08,681 --> 01:04:10,446
You, of all people,
should know that.

1057
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,549
I can't believe you're
talkin' to me like that.

1058
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:13,651
Why don't
you just let him go,

1059
01:04:13,652 --> 01:04:15,785
you dumb fucking grease monkey?

1060
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:17,087
That a nice thing to be saying

1061
01:04:17,088 --> 01:04:18,389
to a guy with a gun?

1062
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,124
Watch it. Put that back.

1063
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:23,292
Real tough guy now
when you have a gun?

1064
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:26,763
I don't need a gun for
a two bit scream queen.

1065
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:28,131
Two bit.

1066
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:31,536
I'm number one scream
queen, ya fucking jerk off.

1067
01:04:33,438 --> 01:04:34,605
I'm gonna feel a
lot better knowing

1068
01:04:34,606 --> 01:04:37,040
I killed a number
one scream queen

1069
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,743
rather than a number two.

1070
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:40,911
Just do it, you dickless fuck.

1071
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:44,014
Myth or no myth, please work.

1072
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:46,616
Jake!

1073
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:48,118
Now that you have become

1074
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:50,021
what you have become,

1075
01:04:50,621 --> 01:04:53,390
it is best that you go
back to your country.

1076
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:57,261
And leave Transylvania forever!

1077
01:04:57,262 --> 01:04:59,430
Who the fuck are
you supposed to be?

1078
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:01,031
I am Dracula.

1079
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:06,303
Ahaha.

1080
01:05:06,304 --> 01:05:07,870
Put your hands down.

1081
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:10,607
Get down on the floor. I'm
gonna cut her heart out.

1082
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:14,243
Listen to them, the
children of the night.

1083
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,345
What the?

1084
01:05:15,346 --> 01:05:16,779
What music they make.

1085
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,416
Are you kidding me?

1086
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:24,989
As the spider spins the
web for the unworthy fly.

1087
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:15,132
Gina? Gina? Is
that really you?

1088
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,635
Gina. Gina, what
are you doing?

1089
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,342
Now we can fuck!

1090
01:07:28,112 --> 01:07:29,113
Okay.

1091
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,318
I can't.

1092
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:39,323
I can't!

1093
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:51,035
No.

1094
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,874
You had me going there.

1095
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,842
That was good. I
was with you there.

1096
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,445
You're good.

1097
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,448
You're good.

1098
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:04,980
I swear it's all true.

1099
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:06,684
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1100
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,219
Hey listen, thanks
for the food, man.

1101
01:08:10,221 --> 01:08:11,855
You should write
that bullshit down.

1102
01:08:11,856 --> 01:08:14,559
I mean, I didn't believe
you but, pretty good story.

1103
01:08:14,926 --> 01:08:16,427
Might make a good
movie or something.

1104
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,395
Call ya tomorrow.
We'll get some beers.

1105
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:20,331
Keep it gay.

1106
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:30,474
What'd you forget?

1107
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:33,143
Gina?

1108
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:47,692
It's over.

1109
01:08:49,226 --> 01:08:50,394
It's over!

1110
01:08:51,028 --> 01:08:53,731
Hey, that was a
damn good movie.

1111
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,867
It's a crossover
film for sure!

1112
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,434
I thought it sucked.

1113
01:08:57,702 --> 01:08:59,570
An overnight success
that took 15 years.

1114
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:00,737
Am I right, Eddie?

1115
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,472
I thought it sucked.

1116
01:09:06,944 --> 01:09:08,178
I really love the part
where the whipped cream

1117
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:09,246
got cleaned off.

1118
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,412
You would.

1119
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:11,848
Hey, what are
you trying to say?

1120
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:12,948
You got a problem with that?

1121
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:14,251
Go eat a sardine.

1122
01:09:14,252 --> 01:09:16,519
Fabulous idea.

1123
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,721
I smell like fish
'cause I love sardines.

1124
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,090
What's your excuse?

1125
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:21,291
Asshole.

1126
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:23,193
Hey Ed, what's taking
Rufus and Lillian

1127
01:09:23,194 --> 01:09:25,763
so long to get back
with the champagne?

1128
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,297
Probably having sex.

1129
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:30,268
That's disgusting.

1130
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:31,968
Not when I do it, baby.

1131
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:33,503
Asshole.

1132
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,038
Guys, take it easy. This is
supposed to be a celebration.

1133
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,774
Fabulous idea.

1134
01:09:38,809 --> 01:09:39,677
Hey Ed.

1135
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:11,309
Everybody!

1136
01:10:13,077 --> 01:10:15,913
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

1137
01:10:30,461 --> 01:10:32,762
Eddie, what are you
doing? Are you crazy?

1138
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:39,202
No. I'm just a
psychopathic producer.

1139
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:42,405
What's goin' on? Are
you feelin' alright?

1140
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:46,076
I'm feeling fine.

1141
01:10:46,344 --> 01:10:47,612
Okay.

1142
01:10:47,712 --> 01:10:51,081
And by the way, Julia,
you sucked in the movie.

1143
01:10:51,082 --> 01:10:54,117
You couldn't act your
way out of a paper bag.

1144
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:55,385
Alright.

1145
01:10:55,386 --> 01:10:57,221
Quit kidding, Eddie.
We're all friends here.

1146
01:10:57,688 --> 01:10:59,023
Friends.

1147
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,224
Good point.

1148
01:11:02,193 --> 01:11:03,360
Leo,

1149
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,430
please come here and
help out a friend.

1150
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:07,565
Yeah, okay.

1151
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,806
Anything else, Eddie?

1152
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:19,408
You really like the
movie, didn't you?

1153
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:20,810
Yeah! I loved it.

1154
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:22,879
That's great.

1155
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,617
That's really, really great!

1156
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:34,824
I guess that's a cut.

1157
01:11:35,826 --> 01:11:37,427
That's not funny, Eddie.

1158
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,296
This is all bullshit.

1159
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:42,898
Now, wake up that jerk off
and let's have a party.

1160
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:43,967
Fine.

1161
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:48,072
You're right. He is a jerk off.

1162
01:11:48,572 --> 01:11:50,507
Why don't you wake him up?

1163
01:11:51,509 --> 01:11:52,576
I will.

1164
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:01,318
Hey, moron!

1165
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:02,887
Get the hell off the floor.

1166
01:12:06,957 --> 01:12:09,393
Hey. This'll wake him up.

1167
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:19,969
He must be wearing a cup.

1168
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,378
Having a little trouble?

1169
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:38,922
You can never find a
PA when you need one.

1170
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,827
My God, he really is dead!

1171
01:13:15,993 --> 01:13:17,695
Did I really
suck in the movie?

1172
01:13:17,696 --> 01:13:19,829
Are you kidding?
You're amazing.

1173
01:13:28,506 --> 01:13:29,840
Go, go, go.

1174
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:35,812
Come on, come
on, come on! Hurry!

1175
01:13:35,813 --> 01:13:38,181
Here, hurry, hurry, hurry!

1176
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:39,916
Hurry!

1177
01:13:41,519 --> 01:13:42,652
My God.

1178
01:13:42,653 --> 01:13:45,554
What the hell happened to Eddie?

1179
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:47,322
Eddie's completely lost it.

1180
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:48,259
No shit.

1181
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,692
Listen, he's just got a knife.

1182
01:13:49,693 --> 01:13:50,894
There's a bunch of us. Why
don't we just jump him?

1183
01:13:50,895 --> 01:13:51,695
Yeah, okay.

1184
01:13:51,696 --> 01:13:52,762
We need a plan.

1185
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:53,923
Eddie?

1186
01:15:15,145 --> 01:15:17,948
Julia? Julia?

1187
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:20,351
Julia!

1188
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:38,903
Shit.

1189
01:15:45,509 --> 01:15:46,609
Julia.

1190
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:51,081
Tim. I thought you left me.

1191
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,684
You alright?

1192
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:57,555
Come on. I wouldn't leave you.

1193
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:00,456
Are you okay?

1194
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:01,858
Are you okay?

1195
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:04,961
Listen, Eddie's still out there.

1196
01:16:04,962 --> 01:16:06,931
So we have to wait it out here.

1197
01:16:06,932 --> 01:16:08,331
No.

1198
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:13,537
Come on, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

1199
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:15,837
He's never
done this before.

1200
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:16,774
Stop.

1201
01:16:16,775 --> 01:16:18,206
I love you.

1202
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:19,777
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, alright?

1203
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:55,813
Would you like a sardine?

1204
01:16:57,948 --> 01:16:58,983
Yeah.

1205
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:01,818
Thanks.

1206
01:17:07,858 --> 01:17:08,858
Tired?

1207
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:10,194
Yeah, a little bit.

1208
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,930
Killing people is
harder than it looks.

1209
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:38,689
How 'bout a snort of this?

1210
01:17:45,695 --> 01:17:48,764
Hahahahaha. The
hair of the dog.

1211
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:50,500
Just what I needed.

1212
01:17:58,509 --> 01:17:59,643
Would you like a napkin?

1213
01:17:59,943 --> 01:18:01,145
Yeah, you got one?

1214
01:18:03,881 --> 01:18:05,783
I thought I did.

1215
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:12,422
Julia.

1216
01:18:18,429 --> 01:18:20,831
Julia?

1217
01:18:21,664 --> 01:18:23,433
Julia! Julia!

1218
01:18:23,434 --> 01:18:24,068
Tim!

1219
01:18:24,069 --> 01:18:26,970
Julia!

1220
01:18:27,237 --> 01:18:28,204
Look!

1221
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,248
Douchebag.

1222
01:18:43,087 --> 01:18:43,987
Come on.

1223
01:18:44,688 --> 01:18:45,889
Come on, come on.

1224
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:49,224
Can't go that fast.

1225
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:50,193
Wait, wait.

1226
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,796
Shit!

1227
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:07,176
Tim!

1228
01:20:12,109 --> 01:20:14,111
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1229
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,279
Shit.

1230
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,880
Ring around the rosie.

1231
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:20,983
Pocket full of spinners!

1232
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:23,051
Going so soon?

1233
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:26,489
Why, my little party's
just beginning!

1234
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:28,759
Come on. Come on!

1235
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:40,903
Top of the world,
Ma! Top of the world!

1236
01:20:58,822 --> 01:20:59,989
You okay?

1237
01:21:02,326 --> 01:21:04,694
It's great to
have an audience.

1238
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,564
I'm ready for my
closeup, Mr. DeMille.

1239
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,540
Hey guys. You like it?

1240
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:19,676
I got it at K-Mart.

1241
01:21:29,519 --> 01:21:31,922
Come out, come
out, wherever you.

1242
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:36,960
They're coming for you, Barbara.

1243
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:43,766
Look! There's one of them now!

1244
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,270
Tim, get up! Tim!

1245
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:48,837
Tim, get up.

1246
01:21:48,838 --> 01:21:50,273
Get up!

1247
01:21:50,274 --> 01:21:52,209
Fuck, he's coming.
Come on, get up!

1248
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:55,011
Get up!

1249
01:21:58,881 --> 01:21:59,949
Go! Julia, go!

1250
01:22:01,385 --> 01:22:03,685
There comes a time
in every man's life

1251
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:05,787
when he must take
the bull by the horns

1252
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:08,056
and face the situation.

1253
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:10,193
I can't. Just
go get the police.

1254
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,634
Fuckin' sick bastard.

1255
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:23,707
Fuckin' sick bastard!

1256
01:22:27,877 --> 01:22:30,079
Come on baby. Come on, baby!

1257
01:22:30,413 --> 01:22:32,648
Chainsaw, don't fail me now!

1258
01:22:38,622 --> 01:22:40,589
By placing my hands so,

1259
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:43,193
I can crush your
head like a walnut.

1260
01:22:47,029 --> 01:22:48,398
Let him go, Eddie.

1261
01:22:51,335 --> 01:22:52,802
I said let him go!

1262
01:22:53,904 --> 01:22:55,339
He's gone, Julia.

1263
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,773
He believes he's Lonzo, the
character from the movie.

1264
01:22:58,007 --> 01:23:00,777
His mind is just a bunch
of celluloid clips!

1265
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:03,746
How is that even possible?

1266
01:23:03,747 --> 01:23:06,615
He believes it with
every fiber of his being.

1267
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,286
Well, I can believe too.

1268
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:12,154
You mean?

1269
01:23:13,724 --> 01:23:18,028
I said I can believe too.

1270
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,497
Fools!

1271
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,532
Do you think you can
kill me with your

1272
01:23:23,533 --> 01:23:25,867
crucifixes and your wolfs bane?

1273
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:29,238
I have centuries behind me!

1274
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:31,875
Yeah. Do it.

1275
01:23:32,676 --> 01:23:35,810
Your blood now flows
through our veins.

1276
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:38,881
Kill the brain and
you kill the ghoul.

1277
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:41,218
Yeah. Do it.

1278
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:43,051
Keep going.

1279
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:44,987
Ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies.

1280
01:23:44,988 --> 01:23:46,121
Keep going!

1281
01:23:46,122 --> 01:23:48,524
Crazy, am I? We'll
see who's crazy.

1282
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,630
It's alive! It's
alive! It's alive!

1283
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:56,699
Leave it alone,
Fritz. Leave it alone.

1284
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,804
Do it.

1285
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,306
And then was
acknowledged the presence

1286
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:09,279
of the red death.

1287
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,393
Mother of mercy.

1288
01:24:24,394 --> 01:24:26,596
Is this the end of Draco?

1289
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:55,791
Holy shit.

1290
01:24:58,161 --> 01:24:59,628
You are a true scream queen.

1291
01:25:04,734 --> 01:25:05,836
God, I love you.

1292
01:25:13,743 --> 01:25:14,711
Julia?

1293
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:18,981
Julia, it's me.

1294
01:25:20,417 --> 01:25:22,352
Julia? Snap out of it.

1295
01:25:22,853 --> 01:25:24,753
Julia? Julia!

1296
01:25:45,408 --> 01:25:47,475
Gina darling.

1297
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,345
I'm truly sorry about
the Scorsese project but,

1298
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:52,281
you do understand.

1299
01:25:52,282 --> 01:25:54,049
It's the nature of the business.

1300
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:57,286
I do and it's alright.

1301
01:25:57,287 --> 01:25:58,754
Don't worry about it.

1302
01:25:58,755 --> 01:25:59,956
Gina, wait.

1303
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:03,026
Forget that I'm your
agent for a moment.

1304
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:05,361
I forgot that weeks ago.

1305
01:26:05,362 --> 01:26:07,929
Hahahaha, you say that now.

1306
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:10,532
But, since your last
picture was released,

1307
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:12,468
my phone rings off the hook

1308
01:26:12,469 --> 01:26:13,969
morning, noon, and night.

1309
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,970
They're begging for you, Gina.

1310
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:17,739
Not just these little
independent producers

1311
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,241
from all these little
shitty pictures.

1312
01:26:19,242 --> 01:26:21,510
I mean Hollywood.
I mean big budget.

1313
01:26:21,511 --> 01:26:23,812
I mean major
producers, major stars,

1314
01:26:23,813 --> 01:26:25,547
and you in all the lead roles.

1315
01:26:25,548 --> 01:26:26,515
Money.

1316
01:26:26,516 --> 01:26:28,717
Don't you understand?

1317
01:26:29,452 --> 01:26:31,252
You can write your
ticket anywhere.

1318
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:33,455
Don't you understand?

1319
01:26:33,456 --> 01:26:36,592
I don't wanna do
horror films anymore!

1320
01:26:36,993 --> 01:26:38,662
God damn it, Tess.

1321
01:26:39,095 --> 01:26:42,096
I don't believe
that for one second.

1322
01:26:42,097 --> 01:26:43,265
You don't believe it.

1323
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:45,800
What was the line
in that one movie?

1324
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:47,236
It suits you perfectly.

1325
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:48,171
No, don't do it. Don't
even think about doing it.

1326
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:49,539
No, I think I know what it is.

1327
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,572
What was that line?

1328
01:26:50,573 --> 01:26:51,773
Tess, don't!

1329
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,408
It was made for
you. I love that line.

1330
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:54,778
Got it!

1331
01:26:55,278 --> 01:26:57,011
No, do not say it.

1332
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:59,916
You are a true scream queen.
