Don't go anywhere.

726
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:22,978
I have a new friend
to attend to.

727
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,025
Handle this.

728
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:42,998
Come here.

729
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,803
You know what to do.

730
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,740
I'll be there
in a few minutes.

(DOOR OPENING)

732
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,298
You really messed up.

733
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,170
I wanted to be friends.

734
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,807
Why couldn't you do it?

735
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:43,258
When we met,
I was nice to you...

736
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,828
Because I thought
you were special.

737
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,098
I thought you would
understand me.

738
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,835
And then I saw
your scar...

739
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:57,773
And I knew we had
a real connection.

740
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,222
Larry?

741
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:15,991
Hi. Kristen, right?

742
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:18,293
Yeah, you said,
uh, 2:00.

743
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,997
I did, you know,
it's the darnedest thing.

744
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:24,800
We had a scheduling problem
with yesterday's model.

745
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,136
I know, I know,
it's such a bummer.

746
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,205
Do you think we could
reschedule tomorrow?

747
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,944
No, but Mother
always said,

748
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:38,814
you can't trust
a pretty girl.

749
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,048
I know that now.

750
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,116
No, please!

751
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:50,158
Oh, don't be such
a coward! A baby!

752
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,561
No, let me tell you,
Mother!

753
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:54,329
No, let me
tell you, Daniel.

754
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:57,933
Let Mother speak.

755
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,102
You know what
I always say.

756
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,841
That courage is the most
important thing.

757
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:09,211
And that what makes
a superhero special,
is their bravery.

758
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,049
And you've been very brave.

759
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:19,054
You've proven
that you could
stand up to Mother

760
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:20,589
and be your own man.

761
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:22,991
I'm so sorry, Daniel!

762
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,434
Now come,
give Mother a hug.

I may have
to work tomorrow.

765
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:50,385
I was really psyched
about getting
the photos today.

766
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,153
I promise
I'll pay you double

767
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:53,922
and we'll give you
extra shots.

768
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:55,423
Huh? Just for being
such a sweetheart?

769
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,029
I'm so sorry.

a shoot you'll never forget.
