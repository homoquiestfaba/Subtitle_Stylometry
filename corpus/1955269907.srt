♪♪

2
00:00:17,753 --> 00:00:19,688
Uuh! Good Morning.

3
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:20,023
Whattup, Katie?

4
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:22,624
Let Me Guess.

5
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:24,895
You're Going To
Venice Beach.

6
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,364
Oh, Would You
Stop Foraging?

7
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,966
Sit Down And
Eat Something.

8
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,501
I Can't, Mom. I'm Late.

9
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:34,636
Wait. Did You
Clean Your Room?

10
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:35,771
S'why I'm Late.

11
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:38,040
Hey, Watch It.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,475
Whattup, Dad?

13
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:41,491
English. That Up.

14
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:57,359
He'll Be Here.

15
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,095
He Said He'd Be Here.

16
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:02,865
Maybe Something
Happened To Him.

17
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:05,567
Maybe He Got Hit By A Car.

18
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:08,504
Or Maybe His Dad's Back
Started Acting Up Again

19
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:10,606
And They Had To Rush Him
To The Hospital.

20
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:13,876
Or Maybe He Got
Kidnapped By Aliens.

21
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:16,645
Don't Joke. That Happened
To An Uncle Of Mine.

22
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:19,648
You're A Lunatic.
Do You Know That?

23
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:21,886
Oh, Man.

24
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:26,622
Great. This Is
The Weekend.

25
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:28,759
Do You Know How Long We're Gonna
Have To Wait For The Next Bus?

26
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,895
Yo, Guys. What Up?

27
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:34,363
Lateness.

28
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:37,466
My Mom Made Me Clean My
Room Before I Could Leave.

29
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:39,034
Fine, But We Missed The Bus.

30
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,369
Now We're Gonna Be Late

31
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,036
And Have To Wait
To Use The Pit.

32
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,374
I Don't Think So.

33
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:46,742
Wait A Minute. Wait.

34
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:49,578
You're Not Thinking About
Skating To The Beach, Are You?

35
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:51,046
Why Not, Jordy?

36
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,482
It's Like A Million
Miles Away.

37
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:55,851
Jordy, Jordy, Jordy.

38
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,386
When You Woke Up This Morning,

39
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:58,520
Did You Say To Yourself,

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,389
"Today I'm Gonna Talk"?

41
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:01,790
Or "Today I'm Gonna Skate"?

42
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,667
Come On. Put 'Em On.

43
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,168
I Told You Guys,

44
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,636
This Is Gonna Be
The Perfect Start

45
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,938
To The Last Day Of
Summer Vacation.

46
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:17,856
Oh, Man, Why Did You
Have To Remind Us?

47
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:37,927
Move It! Come On!

48
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,530
Oh, Yeah.

49
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,477
Come On, Guys.

50
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:57,946
Come On, Guys. Let's
Get Some Speed.

51
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,581
Stop Saying "Guys" All The Time.

52
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:00,716
I'm Not A Guy.

53
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,050
It's Just An
Expression.

54
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,181
Yeah? Well, So Is "Cut It
Out Before I Deck You."

55
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,794
Oh, Yeah. Let's Skate!

56
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:48,198
Yo, Peter. That Was
An Ill Grab, Man.

57
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:52,937
Jordy, That Was Sweet, Man.

58
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:58,173
Gabriel, Watch
That Back Leg.

59
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:00,013
Watch Your Own Back Leg.

60
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,151
Hey, Yo. Check It Out.

61
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,153
<I>He's From Inline Magazine.</I>

62
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:13,822
What's He Doing Here?

63
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,190
They Must Have
Heard About Us.

64
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,658
Cool.

65
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,990
Let's Go Show 'Em What
Soul Skating's All About.

66
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,931
What's He
Waiting For?

67
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,966
Here We Go. Come On, Boys.

68
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,601
Here We Go. Yeah!

69
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:02,204
All Right. Come On.
Looking Good.

70
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:03,939
Move It. Move It.

71
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,640
Ok, Give Me Some
Shots Of The Skates.

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,809
Make Sure You Get
The Skates, And Get
Val Center.

73
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,881
Val, Look Hip.
Come On, Look
Edgy.

74
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,683
Team X-Bladz.

75
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,685
Forget Them.

76
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,754
We've Still Got
The Pit, Right?

77
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:19,755
C'mon, Big Pete.

78
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,002
I Want To See A
540. Let's Go.

79
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,973
Oooh!

80
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:39,674
Oow. That Hurt.

81
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,077
Oh, Man. You Got Worked.

82
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,245
You All Right, Bro?

83
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:45,213
He Tried To Go
Bio On A 540.

84
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:47,716
One And A Half Rotations
Horizontal In The Air.

85
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,351
You Do That, Right?

86
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:51,853
In My Sleep.

87
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,054
I'm Never Gonna
Get That 540.

88
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,990
Sure You Will, Just Not
Talking Like That.

89
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,259
Jimmy, I'm On A
Tight Schedule Here.

90
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,760
Can We Get These Shots
Somewhere Else?

91
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,730
No. I Gotta Get A Picture
Of The Bladz From The Pit.

92
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,298
I've Just Got To Figure Out How
To Get Rid Of These Losers.

93
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,767
I Know 'Em. I'll Just
Ask 'Em To Leave.

94
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:06,935
They'll Do That For You?

95
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:09,873
Of Course.

96
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:14,342
Try To Throw Your Shoulder
In The Rotation More.

97
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:15,277
It'll Help You Out.

98
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,920
Right.

99
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,158
Ooow!

100
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,193
Are You Ok?

101
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,994
Yeah. No Problemo.

102
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:34,262
Yo, Brink. What's Up?

103
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,164
Are You Gonna Do That
At The Invitational

104
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,365
Or Save It For The
Championships?

105
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,067
You What, Val?

106
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,403
I Don't Think You Skate
So Good Anymore, Man.

107
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,271
Maybe You Should Bag
Both Competitions.

108
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:46,241
Naw. I'd Have To Give
Back All This Cool Stuff.

109
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:48,844
Ooh, Sponsored
Skaters.

110
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:50,178
Big Deal.

111
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:51,413
It Is A Big Deal.

112
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:54,416
Team X-Bladz Rules.
Everybody Knows That.

113
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,252
Speaking Of Which, We've
Got A Photo Shoot We're
Trying To Do Here.

114
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,887
Mind Getting Lost?

115
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:00,455
Mind If I Kick Your Butt?

116
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:03,725
Wait. We Had The
Pit First.

117
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:05,827
You Know How It Is.

118
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:08,230
Yeah, But We
Have It Now.

119
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,166
See, You Guys Left The Pit.

120
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,468
B.J.'S Using It.

121
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:14,836
Aren't You, Beej?

122
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:17,472
Ah, Man. You Guys Snaked
It And You Know It.

123
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:20,408
You Guys Should've Left
Someone To Save Your Place.

124
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,279
You Know How It Is.

125
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,780
Val, You Are Such A Jerk.

126
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,884
And That Goes For You Too, Worm.

127
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:32,888
Hey, Gabriella, Ever
Get Arrested For
Impersonating A Boy?

128
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:35,357
No. You?

129
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:37,359
Forget About 'Em.

130
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,927
Maybe In A Couple Of Years
They'll Be Good Enough

131
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,364
And Someone'll Want To Put
Their Pictures In A Magazine.

132
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:43,434
Maybe Not.

133
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,109
Come On. Let's Go.

134
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:55,146
Check It Out.
I've Got An Idea.

135
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,383
Excuse Me. Can I Ask You
Guys A Question?

136
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:03,285
Yeah.

137
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:06,522
All Skateboarders Aren't
Really Wusses, Are They?

138
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:10,258
They All Can't Be
No-Talent, No-Skill,

139
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,260
Half-Smart, Inline
Skating Wannabees.

140
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,228
Am I Right?

141
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:15,997
What Was That?

142
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,866
Personally, I Don't Think
That At All, All Right?

143
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:21,970
But That's Exactly What Those
Guys Over There Told Us.

144
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,939
Those Guys Said That?

145
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,273
Yeah, Man.

146
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:26,913
Let's Go.

147
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:34,049
Oh, That Was Rough, Man.

148
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,250
Val's Gonna Freak.

149
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,385
Hey! I Heard You've
Been Talking About Me.

150
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,021
If He Lives.

151
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,256
You Got Something To Say,

152
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:43,091
Why Don't You Say It
To My Face, Huh?

153
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,468
You Talking About Me?
You Got Something To Say?

154
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:55,539
Yo! What's Up, Fam?

155
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,842
It's Just Not
Normal, That's All.

156
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,177
Ralph, Please.

157
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:03,912
No One Should Be That
Happy All The Time.

158
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,847
What's Wrong With
Being Happy?

159
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,248
He's A Great Kid.

160
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,517
It's Just Not Normal,
That's All.

161
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,020
Do I Have To Go To School?

162
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,422
Why Can't I Be Home
Schooled Like The
Wyatts?

163
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:17,525
Now, You See, Katie
Is A Normal Child.

164
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:20,328
Today's The First Day Of
School, And She's Miserable.

165
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:23,231
Because, Sweetheart, Home
Schooling Is Expensive.

166
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,400
Besides, The Wyatts Are Mormon.

167
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,901
Why Can't We Be Mormons?

168
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,870
I'll Look Into It.

169
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,474
Yo! Let The
Games Begin.

170
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,943
Katie, You're The Future
Of This Family.

171
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:37,145
Now Go To School.

172
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:38,913
Are You Ready For Your First
Day Of School, Sweetheart?

173
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:39,614
Absolutely.

174
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:40,815
Why Don't You Wear Something

175
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:43,518
That Doesn't Look Like Somebody
Just Let The Air Out Of It?

176
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,387
Dad, The Kids At School
Are Down With This Style.

177
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:48,256
How's The Back
Treating You Today?

178
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,125
Thanks, Mom.

179
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,059
Well, If You Ask Me,

180
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,396
I Feel Good Enough
To Be Going Back To
Work Already.

181
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,897
Soon.

182
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:58,566
Andy, Are You Sure
You Don't Want Me To
Drop You?

183
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,868
Got It Covered.

184
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,236
What's For Lunch, Dad?

185
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:02,971
What's Your
Least Favorite?

186
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:04,939
Baloney On White
With Extra Mayo.

187
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:05,573
That's What I Made For You.

188
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:07,659
Ah, Yeah!

189
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,895
Hey, Pete, Jordy,
What's Up, Guys?

190
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:29,497
Hey, You Guys Look Bummin'.

191
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:30,665
What's Going On?

192
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:33,368
Nothing Nine More Months Of
Summer Vacation Couldn't Fix.

193
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:36,204
Did You Guys Hear What
Happened To Gabriella?

194
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:37,505
Is She Ok?

195
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,040
What Happened?

196
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,141
It's Awful.

197
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,543
What?

198
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:43,445
She...

199
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:45,482
It's Too Bad. I Can't Say It.

200
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:48,486
No.

201
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,956
I'm Seeing Things, Aren't I?

202
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:57,158
I Didn't Even Know She
Owned One Of Those.

203
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,030
It's A Dress, Man.

204
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,237
Anybody Say Anything And
I'll Hand You A Body Part.

205
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:12,440
Hey, Gab, Personally, I
Think It's Phat.

206
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,175
Mad Cool.
Right, Guys?

207
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,175
Beautiful.

208
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,444
I Love It.

209
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:17,545
Yeah. Ok.

210
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,547
Look. My Mom Made Me
Wear This Dress.

211
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:23,685
"Back In Peru All The Girls
Wear Dresses On The First
Day Of School."

212
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,187
I Was Like, Ma, This Isn't Peru.

213
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,022
She Says, "It Is
If I Say It Is."

214
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,059
Heads Up!

215
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,360
Hey! Give Me Those.

216
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,162
C'mon, Man. Give 'Em Back.

217
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:37,332
Why Don't You Get Your
Skateboarders Friends
And Make Me?

218
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,567
That Was Pretty Dope, Huh?

219
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,408
Ok, Yeah. I'm Still
Laughing About It.

220
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:48,710
Now, That's Dope.

221
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,678
Val, What Is Your Problem?

222
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,213
I Thought We Were Only
Gonna Mess With 'Em.

223
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,315
That's What We're Doing.

224
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:56,050
You Narc On Me,

225
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,426
I'll Know You're A
Bunch Of Wusses.

226
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,235
This Is Just Great!

227
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,004
Here You Go, Man.

228
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:19,008
If You Don't Lace 'Em Up
They'll Probably Fit You.

229
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:23,378
See, I Was Planning On Changing
Into Some Real Clothes

230
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:24,646
When I Got Here.

231
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:28,616
You Mean You're Gonna Go
Through An Entire First
Day Of School

232
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:32,287
Wearing...Those...For Me?

233
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:36,157
Just Take 'Em Before I
Change My Mind, Ok?

234
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:39,294
Oh, Man, Did You Guys
See That?

235
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:41,629
Soul Skaters.

236
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,398
Together There's
Nothing We Can't Do.

237
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:45,667
That's Right, Guys.
Soul Skaters.

238
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,667
Yes!

239
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,269
Right!

240
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,373
Earthworm Is The Common Name

241
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:59,247
That Is Given To Over 1,000
Different Species Of Worms

242
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:03,083
<I>In A Class Of The
Annelid Phylum.</I>

243
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,654
Earthworms Are
Cylindrical In Shape.

244
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:10,126
Yo, Man. Are We Gonna Have
Val On Our Cases All Year?

245
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,296
I Got A Plan.

246
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,298
Brink, My Man,

247
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,401
Val's Not Exactly
Playing With A Full
Deck.

248
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:22,437
Let's Not Do Anything
We're Gonna Regret.

249
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,105
Shhh.

250
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:26,782
Hey, What's The Plan?

251
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,751
See Ya, Buddy.

252
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,719
Hey, You're Not
Finished, Man.

253
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,454
What's His
Problem?

254
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,556
He's A Soul Skater.

255
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:16,129
That's His Problem.

256
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,707
Ewwww!

257
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,349
Is There A Problem, Val?

258
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:45,353
No. I Thought I Saw
A Bug Or Something.

259
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,428
Well, Get Over It.

260
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,730
Hey, You Know, In
Some Countries

261
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,198
Worms Are Considered
A Delicacy.

262
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:58,333
Go Figure.

263
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:03,219
You, Us, Right Now, Out Back.

264
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:21,189
Say, It's Very Nice, Val.

265
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,957
Have You Ever Thought About
Working With Garbage Cans
For A Living?

266
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:26,194
Do You Ever Give That
Mouth Of Yours A Rest?

267
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:27,595
I Don't Know.

268
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:28,699
Do I?

269
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:36,504
Personally, I Just Want To
Pound The Snot Outta Ya.

270
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:40,241
Boomer Suggested A Race Instead.

271
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:41,876
We Race,

272
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,544
You Win,

273
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:45,646
We Stop Giving You Beef.

274
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,615
You Lose

275
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:51,820
And, Man, It's Like Open
Season On Your Butts.

276
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,888
Deal?

277
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,890
Come On.

278
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,325
You Know There's No
Skating Allowed At
School.

279
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:01,229
Yeah. I Knew You
Couldn't Step Up.

280
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:02,997
What Did I Tell Ya?

281
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:05,805
No Heart.

282
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,478
Let's Do It.

283
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,714
Brink, You'll Get
In Trouble, Man.

284
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,950
We're Gonna Have To
Skate Against These
Guys Sooner Or Later.

285
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,619
Why Not Sooner?

286
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,988
Yeah. Why Not?

287
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,656
All Right, We Go
Side By Side.

288
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,258
When You Get To
The Relay Point

289
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:31,659
You've Got To Slap
The Next Guy's Hand.

290
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,294
Or Girl's Hand.

291
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:34,462
Thank You.

292
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:37,465
Whatever. Before He Can Go.

293
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,300
Or She Can Go.

294
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,936
Chrisie, Call The Start.

295
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:43,643
Let's Go.

296
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,411
All Right, On Your Marks...

297
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,380
You Don't Talk Much.

298
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,381
Get Set...

299
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:54,849
I Like That
In A Man.

300
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,056
Go!

301
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:36,793
C'mon, Boomer, You Wuss!

302
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,394
[ Groaning ]

303
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,896
Brink! What
Are You
Doing?

304
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,364
Boomer, Boomer,

305
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:44,832
Lay Still, Man.

306
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:45,833
This Happened To Me Last Summer.

307
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,636
Just Lay Still.

308
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:51,405
Kimball, Get The Nurse And
Some Ice Right Now. Go! Go!

309
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,573
What Are You Doing?

310
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,375
I'm Gonna Have The Nurse
Take A Look At It.

311
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,476
Brink! The Race!

312
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,778
Relax. Just Relax.

313
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:58,846
You Lost The
Race To Help Me?

314
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,948
Brink, Man, I
Don't Get You.

315
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,550
Take A Number.

316
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,819
What's Going On?

317
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,421
Teacher! Teacher!

318
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,663
Nice.

319
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:17,365
I Think It's A Record.

320
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:18,432
I'm Pretty Sure It Is.

321
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,701
Yo, Dad. Please.

322
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,603
What Was It? Four
And A Half Hours

323
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,504
Into The New School Year
Before Being Suspended?

324
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:24,839
It's Only For Today.

325
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,774
Besides, I Can Explain--

326
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,476
Don't, Don't. I'll
Just Read About It
In The Papers.

327
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:30,978
A Record Like This Has Got To
Attract Media Attention.

328
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:33,147
Dad, Val And His Crew
Were Dissing Us,

329
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:34,916
So We Started Giving
'Em Beef Right Back,

330
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,817
And Then They Wanted To Hit
It Right There At School.

331
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:39,555
And, Clearly, We Couldn't Step
Off, So We Had To Battle.

332
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:41,889
Who Are You?

333
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,858
What Have You Done
With My Son?

334
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:45,693
God, Dad...

335
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,995
Don't They Teach
English At Your
School?

336
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,564
Wait A Minute.

337
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:51,632
What Am I Asking You For?

338
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,767
You Haven't Been There
Long Enough To Find Out.

339
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,869
Dad, You're Not
Listening To Me.

340
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,437
Sure I Am.

341
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,105
You Got Dissed.
You Ate Beef.

342
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,842
Did I Miss Anything?

343
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,044
Great!

344
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:04,912
Lovely.

345
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:05,030
Just Lovely.

346
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,066
Well, Let's Recap, Shall We?

347
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,568
The Car's Gonna Cost Us $900.

348
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:30,771
The Dentist Called To Say
That If We Don't Spent $300

349
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,506
On Katie's Night Brace,

350
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,175
She's Gonna Have A Smile
Like A Picasso Painting.

351
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:38,179
I Called Beckman Today To See If
There Was Gonna Be A Job For Me

352
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,047
When My Disability Was Over,

353
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,550
And He Said That He
Couldn't Promise Anything,

354
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,021
And Your Son Was Suspended
From School On His First Day.

355
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:50,191
So, How Was Your Day?

356
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,826
It Was Fine.

357
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,227
Sell Any Houses?

358
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,528
Ah, No.

359
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,497
Show Any Houses?

360
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:57,732
No.

361
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:00,067
Well, Then, Our
Troubles Are Over.

362
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,802
Oh, Come On. Be Nice.

363
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,471
I'm Sorry.

364
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:04,872
It's Gonna Be Ok.

365
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,241
We Have Been Through
Much Worse Than This.

366
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,776
If You Say So.

367
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,145
Ralph, Do You
Remember When You
Fell Off That Beam?

368
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:14,048
We Didn't Even Know If You
Were Gonna Walk Again.

369
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,851
Yeah. I'd Say
That Was Worse.

370
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,819
And Now Look At You--

371
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:21,022
Strutting Around. You Can't
Wait To Get Back To Work.

372
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:25,059
All I Need Is My Job Back.

373
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,528
Don't Worry About The Money.

374
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,930
We're Gonna Be Ok.

375
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,046
The Mortgage Isn't Due Until
The First Of The Month.

376
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:47,148
Well, There Was Screaming
And Then Yelling,

377
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:49,050
And Then There Was
Crying And Hugging.

378
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,652
It Was All Very Peruvian.

379
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,055
How Did Your Fam
Deal With It, Jordy?

380
00:20:54,055 --> 00:21:00,194
Well, There Was
Sitting And Staring,

381
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:04,532
And Afterwards There Was
Some More Sitting And
Staring.

382
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:07,935
And For All I Know, My
Parents Are Still In The
Living Room...

383
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,872
Sitting And Staring.

384
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:15,309
Well, Jerry Handled It Kinda The
Way It Was Done At Gabriella's--

385
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:18,813
There Was Screaming, Yelling,
Crying, And Hugging.

386
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:21,182
Only Without The Hugging.

387
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:24,752
My Mother Was Conveniently
Hiding In The Next Room.

388
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,054
Hey, At Least You
Got Two Parents.

389
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:30,925
I Got A Mom And A Jerry.

390
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:34,562
Do The Math.
That's One Parent.

391
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:39,200
Look, Guys, Things Got A
Little Out Of Hand The
Other Day, You Know.

392
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,570
We Gotta Chill And
Let Things Blow Over.

393
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,938
All Right?

394
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:46,640
Hey, Check It Out.
Jerkweeds At 2:00.

395
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,943
Hiya, Children.

396
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,345
Excuse Me,
But I Believe

397
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:54,882
We Out-Skated Your Sorry
Butts Yesterday, Old Man.

398
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,317
Any Time You Want To
Go At It Again--

399
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,987
Cut It Out.

400
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,355
I Guess You Heard
About Boomer?

401
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:04,792
Yeah. How Long's
He Gonna Be Out?

402
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,059
A Couple Of Weeks.

403
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,729
For Sure, He's Out
Of The Invitational.

404
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:11,165
Means There's An Open
Spot On The Team.

405
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,934
Ha Ha. Yeah, Right.

406
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,904
Like We're Gonna Try
Out For Team X-Bladz.

407
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,773
Like Any Of You
Have The Talent?

408
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:23,277
I'm Telling You So You Grommets
Know You're Not Invited.

409
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:24,612
Good. You Told Us.

410
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,046
Now Beat It!

411
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,916
You Don't Get It, Do You?

412
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,720
Being A Sponsored
Skater Is Cool.

413
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,822
I Get All The Newest Gear
Whenever I Need It,

414
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:38,092
I Get My Picture In Every
Skating Magazine On The Planet--

415
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:40,361
Oh, Now I'm Nauseous.

416
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,700
And I Make A Lot Of Money.

417
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,702
Just Think
About That--

418
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,638
Being Known
As The Best,

419
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:53,276
And Getting Paid
At The Same Time.

420
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:57,646
What Could Be Sweeter?

421
00:22:58,646 --> 00:22:59,814
Hey, Look.

422
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:01,248
We Don't Care About
Any Of That Stuff.

423
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:03,417
We Skate For Fun.

424
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,186
We're Soul Skaters.

425
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:06,956
Right, Brink?

426
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:10,860
Right.

427
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,364
Why Is It That The
Losers Always Say
They're In It For Fun?

428
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,802
C'mon On.

429
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,704
Can You Believe That Guy?

430
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,372
Skatin' For Money.

431
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:26,143
What A Sell-Out.

432
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:30,845
Think He'll Show?

433
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,216
You Know It.

434
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:37,084
Ok, Dude, Give Us The 540.

435
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,286
I Want To See It Laid
Out And Inverted.

436
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:40,264
You Can Do It.

437
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,235
Aw, Man.

438
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:56,103
There's Gotta Be A Better
Way To Do This.

439
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,375
There Is. Don't Fall.

440
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,110
You Ok, Dude?

441
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,980
Yeah, Man.

442
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,314
Hey, What's Up
With You Today?

443
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:08,349
You're Looking So Sketchy.

444
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,284
Nothing. I'm Fine.

445
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,387
Cool.

446
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:15,256
Guy, I've Got To Get Going.

447
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,858
I've Got This Family Thing
To Do This Afternoon.

448
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,226
Wait A Minute.

449
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:20,995
What About Our Session?

450
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:23,364
The Invitational's In Two Weeks.

451
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:25,332
It's The Last Competition
Before The Championship.

452
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,368
Yeah, I Know.

453
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:29,803
Look. You Guys Keep On Training.

454
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,939
And, Peter, Keep
Working On That 540.

455
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,174
And I'll Do Some Of My Own
Stuff On My Own, All Right?

456
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,342
Ok.

457
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:37,179
All Right.

458
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,198
Bye.

459
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,867
All Right. That's It For Now.

460
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,169
I've Got Your Numbers.

461
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,948
I'll Call You If You Made It.

462
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:49,017
What About Brad?

463
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,518
No Good. Too Buckled.

464
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:52,486
Right?

465
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:53,854
Yeah.

466
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:55,389
Markoff?

467
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,558
No Way. Nobody Wants
To Session With Him.

468
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,126
We Only Need Him
For One Month.

469
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:01,829
And After That, We Never
Got To Talk To Him Again.

470
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,897
What Do You Think, Beej?

471
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,132
I Don't Think So.

472
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:08,005
Too Bad Your Secret Weapon
Was A No-Show.

473
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,944
I Don't Believe It.

474
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:20,114
What Did I Tell Ya?

475
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:21,248
Watch This.

476
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,284
No Way, Man. No Way.

477
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:25,020
How Much?

478
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,521
What?

479
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:30,124
How Much Does
X-Bladz Pay?

480
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,291
How Much?

481
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,395
Well, $200 A Week.

482
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:36,130
Plus All Equipment.

483
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,531
Plus An Extra $200
Bonus For Each Of Us

484
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,032
When We Win Tournaments,

485
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,001
But There's No Way
I'm Gonna Let You On
The Team.

486
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,338
Well, There's No Way
I Wanted To Be Here

487
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:45,606
But I Need The Money.

488
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,508
What For, Grandma
Needs A New Kidney?

489
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:51,011
Besides, I Thought You
Were--What Do You Guys
Call That--

490
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,080
Oh, Soul Skater.

491
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,550
So, How About
You Turn Around

492
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,085
And Soul Skate
On Out Of Here.

493
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,289
Yeah, Brink, Get Out Of Here.

494
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,992
Fine.

495
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:06,998
Wait A Second.

496
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:14,068
You've Got 30
Seconds. Street Run.

497
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:15,665
One Chance.

498
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,936
Time's Up.

499
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,704
How Are You On Vert?

500
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:53,040
Just As Good As Street.
Maybe Better.

501
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Downhill?

502
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,542
I Can Do It All.

503
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,177
How About Peter
And The Rest?

504
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,047
They Know You're
Doing This?

505
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,315
This Is Gonna Be Good.

506
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,217
I Can't Wait To See The
Look On Their Faces.

507
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:04,418
No Way.

508
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,020
This Is Just Through
The Invitation

509
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,455
Till Boomer's Back
On His Feet.

510
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:11,558
If This Gets Out, Then I
Don't Skate With You,

511
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:12,559
And You've Got Nobody.

512
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,694
Got That?

513
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,564
Hey, We Won't
Say Anything,

514
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:20,032
But You Have To Be
At Every Practice.

515
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,602
All Right.

516
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:27,207
And, Uh, No More Bagging On
Me In Front Of People.

517
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,011
From Now On, You Start
Showing Me Some Respect.

518
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,281
You Got That?

519
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,684
Yeah. I Got It.

520
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,689
Let's Go See Jimmy.

521
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:45,425
Oooh! You Went Big
There, My Man.

522
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,594
You See, Andy--

523
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:49,296
Do You Mind If I
Call You Andy?

524
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,298
Brink. I Like Brink.

525
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,267
Brink. I
Love That.

526
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,435
Brink. Ha Ha Ha.

527
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:58,505
See, That's What X-Bladz
Is All About-- Going Big.

528
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:02,409
I'm In 1,200 Outlets Nationwide.

529
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:06,680
Last Year I Moved Over
10 Million Dollars'
Worth Of Merchandise.

530
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,383
And All Because Of Team X-Bladz.

531
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:13,086
So, I Guess The Big Question Is,

532
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,056
Are You Ready To Go
Big For X-Bladz?

533
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:18,625
Big As You Want.

534
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,694
Did You Hear That?

535
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,763
As Big As I Want.

536
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,531
You Better Watch Your Back.

537
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:27,434
This Boy Here's Liable
To Put You Out Of A Job.

538
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,437
Don't Worry About That, Jimmy.

539
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:34,441
So, Val Told You About The
Money And How That Works.

540
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,042
You're Ok With That, Right?

541
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,644
Yeah.

542
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,046
All Right. Then
It's Official Then.

543
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:41,481
You're Part Of The Team.

544
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:44,751
From Now On, There'll
Be No Competing

545
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,486
Unless You're Flying
The X-Bladz Colors.

546
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:47,621
You Got That?

547
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,156
All Right.

548
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:51,758
I'm Gonna Need You 24/7 For
Like Photo Shoots, Promos,

549
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,193
Industry Shows,
Stuff Like That.

550
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:56,096
Ok.

551
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,166
Ok.

552
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,570
Well, Then...

553
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,606
Parents?

554
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:06,707
Your Parents Know
About This?

555
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:07,574
My Parents?

556
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:08,508
Yeah. They Down With This?

557
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:10,310
Oh, My Parents. Yeah.

558
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,446
All Right. Ok.

559
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:15,624
Well, Then, Welcome
To Team X-Bladz.

560
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:25,225
S'up, Katie?

561
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:26,695
What's In The Bag?

562
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:30,297
Just My Stuff.

563
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:32,232
You Got More
Stuff Now Than
When You Left.

564
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,801
What's In The Bag?

565
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,403
Nunya.

566
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,472
Nunya?

567
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:40,440
Nunya Business.

568
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,334
A-Haa A-Haa.

569
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:10,838
Great.

570
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:15,428
Wait A Second.

571
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:37,403
Oh, Man, What Am I Doing?

572
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,873
Katie, Why Don't You
Slow Down A Little Bit?

573
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:50,410
What's The Point Of
Having A Fast Metabolism
If I Don't Use It?

574
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,346
She's Got Something There.

575
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:53,714
Andy, Are You Ok?

576
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:54,750
You've Hardly Eaten Anything.

577
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,720
Uh, With Dad Not Working.

578
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,724
I Think That Maybe
It's Time I Got A Job

579
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:04,858
To Help Out Around Here.

580
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:07,527
You Know, With The
Money And Stuff.

581
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:09,596
Oh, Andy, That Is A
Wonderful Offer,

582
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:10,797
But You Don't Have To Do That.

583
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:13,467
Mr. Beckman's Gonna
Give Dad His Job Back.

584
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,736
And I Just Showed A House
Today To Some People.

585
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,237
I Think They're
Very Interested.

586
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:19,473
No, No, No.
Wait A Second.

587
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,611
I Think It's Good.

588
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,680
What Kind Of A Job Are
You Talking About?

589
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,483
Well, I Know These Kids Who
Make Extra Money Skating.

590
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:31,451
Skating?

591
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:34,287
Yeah. See, They Got
On A Sponsored Team

592
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,990
And The Sponsor Pays Them To
Wear Their Gear And Stuff.

593
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,627
It's Kind Of Like Advertising.

594
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,362
I Thought You Skated
Just For Fun.

595
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:44,731
Maybe He Could Save
It For School.

596
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:47,601
How Much Money Does A
Sponsored Skater Make?

597
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:48,702
A Couple Hundred A Week.

598
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,405
More If The Team Wins.

599
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:53,673
A Couple Hundred Bucks
A Week. I Like.

600
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:54,276
That's A Lot Of Money.

601
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:57,844
No.

602
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:00,881
But, Dad, I'm Thinking That,
Like, The Car Need Fixing.

603
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:02,382
No.

604
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:06,286
Isn't This The Kid Who Was
Just Suspended From School

605
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:09,790
For...Geez, What Was It?

606
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,924
Skating.

607
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:12,893
Thank You, Sweetheart.

608
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:13,028
Skating.

609
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:17,764
Yeah. What Do We Need Him To
Be On A Sponsored Team For?

610
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:20,333
So He Can Spend All Of His
Time Thinking About Skating,

611
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,001
Instead Of Just Most Of It?

612
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,805
Look, Buddy, You
Want To Get A Job,

613
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:26,573
I Think That's Great.

614
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:27,741
But Not Skating.

615
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:31,812
Dad, It's $200 A Week.

616
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,887
Not Skating!

617
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:42,956
So, Jordy Hits The Rail,

618
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:44,391
Pulls It Halfway,

619
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,460
And Then Lands It Right
On His Crotch!

620
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,628
<I> The Poor Dude Got Worked.</I>

621
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:50,497
<I> I Thought Gabriella Was
Gonna Need Oxygen</I>

622
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,998
<I> She Was Laughing So Hard.</I>

623
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:53,733
I Thought He Should
Put Some Ice On It,

624
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:56,903
But He Just Kept Saying,
"No Ice! No Ice!"

625
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:57,003
[ Knocking ]
I Gotta Use The Phone.

626
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:01,341
<I> You Can Use It When I'm Done.</I>

627
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,009
You Know, We Did Ok
After You Took Off,

628
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,447
But It Just Wasn't
The Same Without You.

629
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,649
C'mon, Man. You
Don't Mean That.

630
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:13,487
Excuse Me. You're The
Captain Of Our Team,
Remember?

631
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:15,856
<I> We Can't Have Our Captain
Missing Any More Sessions.</I>

632
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:18,625
Hey, Peter, There's Something I
Gotta Tell You Right Now, Man.

633
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,625
<I> Now, Peter!</I>

634
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,961
I'm Getting Off.

635
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:22,662
Brink, Man, I'm Sorry.

636
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:23,030
<I> Stepdad-Of-The-Year Is About</I>

637
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,533
To Go Postal On Me If I Don't
Let Him Use The Phone.

638
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,901
I'll See You At School Tomorrow.

639
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,511
Wait, Wait. Pete. Pete.

640
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:39,479
You Need More
Baking Powder.

641
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,747
What?

642
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:43,483
The Recipe Has A Large "T"
Next To The Number.

643
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,418
That Means Tablespoon.

644
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,588
A Small "T" Means Teaspoon.

645
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:50,359
Why Are You Even Watching Me?

646
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,760
Hey, You Ok, Man?

647
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,961
It's Only A Cake.

648
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:57,901
Yeah, Yeah.

649
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:04,404
Did You Guys Ever Notice
That Baking A Cake

650
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:05,507
Is A Lot Like Friendship?

651
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:08,975
Excuse Me?

652
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:10,911
I Mean...

653
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:13,647
You Put A Lot Of Work
Into It, Right?

654
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:16,683
And Sometimes It Doesn't Turn
Out The Way You Expected It To,

655
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:19,155
But It Still Tastes Good.

656
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,824
I Told You Not To Eat That
Spoonful Of Frosting.

657
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:26,760
Yeah. Sugar Can Mess You Up.

658
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,961
It's True. I Have
This Cousin,

659
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,663
And She's Not Allowed
To Eat Any Sugar.

660
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:31,765
But One Day She Had
Like Four Jellybeans

661
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:33,667
And Started Bouncing Off
The Walls Like A Pinball.

662
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,435
Shut Up, Jordy.

663
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:36,038
Please.

664
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:40,540
Look, Guys, There's Something
I'm Trying To Tell You.

665
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,975
There You Go With That
"Guy" Stuff Again.

666
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:43,810
Gabriella, Chill
Out For A Second.

667
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,780
I've Got To Talk To You Guys
About The Invitational.

668
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,116
Oh, Yeah. We're Gonna
Have A Good Time, Huh?

669
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:52,118
Hey, Betty Crockers.

670
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:56,088
Oh, Love The Aprons.

671
00:35:56,088 --> 00:36:00,126
So, How's The
Training Going?

672
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:02,696
I Mean, The Invitational's
Right Around The Corner.

673
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:05,165
The Last Two Years, The Team
That Won The Invitational

674
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,500
Did Go On To Win The
Championship.

675
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,537
Now, What Team Was That?

676
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:12,872
Hmmm...

677
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:16,509
That's Right. Team X-Bladz.

678
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,914
Val, Could You Be
Any More Of A Jerk?

679
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,684
No. I Don't Think So.

680
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:26,152
Is That What You Think?

681
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:28,188
Do You Think I'm A Jerk?

682
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,690
Uuh...

683
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,493
Come On, Val. We're
Working Here, Man.

684
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:36,199
Hey, I Asked You Something.

685
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,070
Do You Think I'm A Jerk?

686
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,640
No.

687
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,243
Excuse Me?

688
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:53,780
No. I Don't Think
You're A Jerk.

689
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,752
Oh, Thank You.

690
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,491
See You This
Afternoon, Brink.

691
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,027
Yo, Buddy. What Happened?

692
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:10,664
Yeah, You Just Let Val
Slime All Over You.

693
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:13,934
He's Not Worth It.

694
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:16,703
What Did He Mean He'd
See You This Afternoon?

695
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:20,835
Uh...Who Knows?

696
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:50,270
Hey, Man, Good Job.

697
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,571
Thanks, Man.

698
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,306
That Was Rad,
Brink.

699
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:54,641
What Was That?

700
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:56,010
Excuse Me?

701
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,779
I Just Wanted To
Know What That Was.

702
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,214
Because If You Call
That Going Big,

703
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:02,949
I'm Gonna Quit Skating.

704
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,318
Well, We're All Gonna
Miss You, Buddy.

705
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,325
Ha Ha. Gotcha.

706
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,595
Hit It Again.

707
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:17,263
You're Kidding Me, Right?

708
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,768
Hit It Again.

709
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,336
Come On, Val.
He's Doing Ok.

710
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:26,339
Who's Running The
Show Here?

711
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,941
Who?

712
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:29,175
You.

713
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:32,047
That's Right.

714
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,194
Do It Or Vacate.

715
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:49,709
Good Doggy.

716
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:04,277
Maybe Something
Happened To Him.

717
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:05,979
Like What?

718
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:08,083
And Please Don't Start With
That Alien Stuff Again.

719
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,718
Yo. Whattup?

720
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:13,085
Where Ya
Been, Man?

721
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,854
We've Been Waiting
For Two Hours.

722
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,623
I've Got To Be
Home By 5:30.

723
00:39:16,623 --> 00:39:18,658
Jerry's Having His Boss
Over For Dinner,

724
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:21,127
And I Gotta Pretend
I Worship The Ground
He Walks On.

725
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,229
Well, Then, What
Are We All Doing

726
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:24,831
Standing Around Talking?

727
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,332
Hey, Did You Guys Hear?

728
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:28,201
Val Found Someone To
Replace Boomer.

729
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,369
Yeah, I Heard That Too.

730
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,172
Yeah. I Head It Too.

731
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:33,973
I Heard The Guy
Was A Big Guy.

732
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:35,909
Like Korean, I Think.

733
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,077
No, No. Wait. He Was
Native American.

734
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:38,077
Yeah. That Was It.

735
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:39,979
I Heard He's Really Good.

736
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:42,382
I Don't Care
How Good He Is,

737
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:45,353
He Isn't Better
Than My Man Here.

738
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,389
That Just Means We've
Got To Hit Twice As Hard.

739
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,260
Let's Do It.

740
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,835
Yeah. Let's Do It.

741
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:04,739
S'up, Dad?

742
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:07,007
I'm Just Trying To
Fix The Beast Here

743
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:10,815
Without Any Real Knowledge
Of Automotive Mechanics.

744
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:17,217
What's The Matter With You?

745
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,452
Nothing, Really.

746
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:20,353
I'm Just A Little Tired.

747
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:22,222
Too Much Skating?

748
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:24,457
Skating? Too Much? Me?

749
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:25,992
Ha. No Way.

750
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:28,962
Well, You Won't Have To
Worry About That Anymore.

751
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:31,832
I Got You A Job.

752
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:34,870
A Job?

753
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,440
My Friend Benny-- He's Got
The Dog Grooming Place.

754
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,041
He's Looking For
Someone To Help Out

755
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,111
A Couple Of
Afternoons A Week.

756
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,946
That's Great, Dad,

757
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:48,848
But I Don't Know A
Thing About Animals.

758
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:51,417
You Baby-Sit Your Sister
Katie, Don't You?

759
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:53,488
Can't Be A Lot
Different Than That.

760
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:57,090
Come On. What's Wrong?

761
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,125
I Thought You Wanted To
Help Out Around Here.

762
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,996
I Do. I Just Don't Have
Time For A Job Right Now.

763
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:04,163
Why?

764
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:07,032
And Please Don't
Tell Me Skating.

765
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:10,939
Because You Know What My
Response Is Going To Be.

766
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:15,068
When Do I Start?

767
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:51,171
Brink?

768
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:53,272
Hey, Man.

769
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:55,541
I Came As Soon As I Could.

770
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:56,309
How're You Feeling?

771
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,945
Not So Good.

772
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:00,413
[ Coughing ]

773
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,047
You Look Terrible.

774
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,083
You're Soaked With Sweat.

775
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,085
I Know, Man.

776
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:09,522
I Can't Make It To The
Invitational Today.

777
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:10,023
I'm Sorry.

778
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:12,525
Hey, No Big.

779
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:14,127
Just Feel Better, Ok?

780
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:15,962
Yeah.

781
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:18,431
Would You Do Me A Huge
Favor And Get Me A
Tissue Over There?

782
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:20,003
Sure.

783
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:25,405
Here You Go.

784
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:27,881
Thanks, Man.

785
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:38,050
Will You Tell The
Others For Me?

786
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,318
Sure.

787
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:40,987
Hey, We'll Go Check
It Out Anyway.

788
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:42,657
No!

789
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:46,592
I Mean, No, Man. Don't.

790
00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:50,129
You Know, The Invitational's
Only A Warm-Up For The
Championship.

791
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:51,998
You Guys Should Session Instead.

792
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:54,367
Ok. You're The Boss.

793
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:55,902
Take It Easy.

794
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:57,298
All Right, Man.

795
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:27,934
I Told Him To Be
Here An Hour Ago.

796
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,404
He'll Be Here.

797
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:33,673
Since When Did You Start
Sticking Up For Him?

798
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:34,377
Hey.

799
00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:40,213
What Do You Think You're Doing?

800
00:44:40,213 --> 00:44:41,380
Hey, Guys.

801
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,717
So What's With The Shades?

802
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:47,520
It's A Look. There's
Nothing Wrong With A
Look.

803
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,522
Yo, X-Bladz. You're Up.

804
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:52,625
Well, That Look Of Yours

805
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:55,534
Better Come With Some
Skating Attached.

806
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:03,436
This Is Nuts!

807
00:45:03,436 --> 00:45:05,638
We Should At Least Check
Out The Invitational,

808
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:07,406
See Who Our Competition Is.

809
00:45:07,406 --> 00:45:10,243
Yeah. Maybe Get A
Glimpse Of The
X-Bladz Mystery Man.

810
00:45:10,243 --> 00:45:11,244
Come On, Guys.

811
00:45:11,244 --> 00:45:12,678
Brink Said We
Should Session.

812
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:14,280
And We Will...

813
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,349
After.

814
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:18,686
Come On. We Should At Least
Catch The Last Round.

815
00:45:20,686 --> 00:45:22,332
Are You Coming?

816
00:45:33,332 --> 00:45:35,298
<I> Next Up, Mickey Grimes.</I>

817
00:46:05,298 --> 00:46:07,701
Great Job!

818
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:11,637
Look At That! We Need
At Least A 96 To Win.

819
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:13,439
I've Been Carrying Your
Sorry Butts All Day,

820
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:15,143
And I'm Just About Ready
To Drop All Three Of You.

821
00:46:17,143 --> 00:46:21,180
And, You. I Thought You Were
Supposed To Be Something.

822
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,216
"As Big As You Want."

823
00:46:23,216 --> 00:46:25,685
Well, I Want Real Big.

824
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:28,188
And I Want It Right
Now. You Got That?

825
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:30,490
I Got It.

826
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,532
<I> Next Up, Andy "Brink" Brinker.</I>

827
00:46:39,532 --> 00:46:40,533
3...

828
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:41,534
2...

829
00:46:41,534 --> 00:46:42,568
1...

830
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:43,253
Go.

831
00:47:00,253 --> 00:47:01,290
That Must Be The New Kid.

832
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,761
He Doesn't Look Korean.

833
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:10,746
That's Because He's Not.

834
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:28,350
Whoooo!

835
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,586
How Was That?

836
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:35,157
I'll Tell You In
A Few Seconds.

837
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:40,531
<I> 97. Team X-Bladz.</I>

838
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,433
My Man, Val!

839
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:49,435
Hey! All Right!

840
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:50,836
And, You, My Man.

841
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:52,571
I Knew You Would Be Good

842
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:53,839
But I Did Not Know
You Would Be Great.

843
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:54,907
Thanks, Jimmy.

844
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:56,375
You Guys Killed!

845
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,877
You're Gonna Be Unstoppable
At The Championship.

846
00:47:57,877 --> 00:48:00,279
Look. I Got A Little
Something, Huh?

847
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:02,315
It's A Bonus
For Winning.

848
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:03,683
$200.

849
00:48:03,683 --> 00:48:05,888
Not Bad For A
Day's Work, Huh?

850
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,289
I Knew It!

851
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:12,591
All Those Excuses! All
That Sneaking Away!

852
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,560
You Ditched Us So You Could
Join These Sell-Outs.

853
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,896
Gabriella, I Can
Explain Everything.

854
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:18,397
You Can Explain How
You Lied To Us?

855
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:21,867
How You Bailed On Us So You
Could Join Team X-Bladz?

856
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:24,937
Do You Have Any Idea
How Many Times I
Stuck Up For You?

857
00:48:24,937 --> 00:48:26,205
Peter...

858
00:48:26,205 --> 00:48:27,576
And Your Stupid Fever?

859
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:32,845
Come On.

860
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:33,913
Come On, Wait.

861
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:36,816
All Right, Play Time's Over.

862
00:48:36,816 --> 00:48:38,918
I Say We Get
Together Tonight

863
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,563
And Go Over Some Drills
For The Championship.

864
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:53,799
Well, Looks Like We Just
Lost Our Fourth Man.

865
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:57,605
I Don't Think So, Jimmy.

866
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,474
Ok, It's Like This.

867
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:03,442
We Need Four People To Compete
In The Championship, Right?

868
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:05,511
We'll Get Benjy.

869
00:49:05,511 --> 00:49:08,280
No. Not Benjy.

870
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,383
His Style Is So Sketchy.

871
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:12,551
She's Right. He's
Like Two Steps Above
A Poser.

872
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:15,321
I Know. But We Just Get
Him To Sign Up With Us,

873
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:18,424
Then We Keep Rotating
Ourselves In Instead Of Him.

874
00:49:18,424 --> 00:49:19,892
But What About The Downhill?

875
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:21,594
Which One Of Us
Could Handle That?

876
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:24,463
All Right. We'll Go Check
Out The Downhill Course.

877
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:25,965
And See Who Can Do It.

878
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:27,272
How About Me?

879
00:49:33,272 --> 00:49:35,610
Ok If I Sit Down?

880
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,949
Sure. It's Ok.

881
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:46,485
Wait. Wait.

882
00:49:46,485 --> 00:49:48,621
You Guys, Come On. I
Quit Val's Team.

883
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:49,459
I Quit!

884
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:56,595
You Want To Know The
Difference Between
Them And Me?

885
00:49:56,595 --> 00:49:59,965
You Bailed On Them
And You Bailed On Me.

886
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:04,905
The Difference Is, I'm Willing
To Be Your Friend Again.

887
00:50:05,905 --> 00:50:08,741
Boomer's Not Going To Be
Ready For The Championship.

888
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:12,878
Them? They're Going
Nowhere Fast.

889
00:50:12,878 --> 00:50:15,014
But Us,

890
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:18,027
We've Got A
Championship To Win.

891
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:32,579
All Right. Welcome Back.

892
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,881
It's Just Not
Normal, That's All.

893
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:51,817
He's Tired And
He's A Teenager.

894
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:53,586
Nobody's That
Unhappy All The
Time.

895
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:56,489
I Mean, It's
Been Two Weeks.

896
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,991
Didn't You Used To Complain
Because He Was Too Happy?

897
00:50:58,991 --> 00:51:01,861
Yeah.

898
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:03,029
I Guess I Just Hoped He'd
Settle Somewhere In The
Middle.

899
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:06,699
It's So Depressing
To Talk To Him.

900
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:09,034
And What About His Friends?

901
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:11,103
They're Still Mad At
Him Over Something.

902
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:12,605
He Won't Say What.

903
00:51:12,605 --> 00:51:15,774
Why Don't You
Talk To Him?

904
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,743
Me?

905
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:18,878
Yeah.

906
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:20,479
Talk To Brink?

907
00:51:20,479 --> 00:51:22,047
You Mean With Words?

908
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:23,382
Yeah.

909
00:51:23,382 --> 00:51:24,884
You Know How Hard It Is

910
00:51:24,884 --> 00:51:26,352
For Me To Have A
Conversation With Him?

911
00:51:26,352 --> 00:51:30,054
I Know. Such A Moody
Little Sack Of Hormones.

912
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:30,054
Katie.

913
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:30,054
Katie.

914
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,092
Fine.

915
00:51:33,092 --> 00:51:37,630
Honey, Talk To Him.

916
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,402
He Needs You.

917
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:45,672
Go On.

918
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:48,489
Go.

919
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:04,924
Yo, Dad.

920
00:52:04,924 --> 00:52:06,960
Yo.

921
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,061
Can I Talk To You
For A Second?

922
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:11,077
Yeah.

923
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:28,047
So...

924
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:30,049
I Haven't Seen Peter
Or Jordy For Awhile.

925
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:32,785
Why's That?

926
00:52:32,785 --> 00:52:35,087
Just A Thing.

927
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:38,691
A Thing. All Right.

928
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:40,194
Answers That Question.

929
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:43,629
Everything Ok With Them?

930
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:46,432
Yeah, Dad.
It's Fine.

931
00:52:46,432 --> 00:52:50,436
Is That "Fine" As In "Good,"

932
00:52:50,436 --> 00:52:53,205
Or "Fine" As In
"Leave Me Alone"?

933
00:52:53,205 --> 00:52:55,541
I Don't Know, Dad.

934
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,910
I Just Don't Feel Like
Talking About It, Ok?

935
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,047
Ok.

936
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:03,059
It's None Of My Business.

937
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:20,065
Except, Andy, You're My Son.

938
00:53:20,065 --> 00:53:22,935
Taking Care Of You
Is My Business.

939
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:27,139
You Can Tell Me Or Don't
Tell Me. It's Ok.

940
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:30,677
But That Doesn't Change
My Job Description.

941
00:53:31,677 --> 00:53:33,879
If You Change Your Mind,

942
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:36,937
I'm Here, Buddy.

943
00:53:58,937 --> 00:54:01,674
The Championship Has
Three Parts--

944
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:05,043
Street, Vert, And Downhill.

945
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:07,980
This Is Gonna Be The
Downhill Course.

946
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,249
The Two Teams With The Highest
Scores On Street And Vert

947
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:12,620
Send One Person Right Here.

948
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,056
Yo! Earth To Brink!

949
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:19,258
Pay Attention. What
Are You Looking At?

950
00:54:19,258 --> 00:54:24,296
Well, I Was Just Thinking
How Fun It Might Be

951
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:27,132
To Do A Launch Off One Of
Those Driveways Right There,

952
00:54:27,132 --> 00:54:29,268
Go Up And Over The Roof
Of The Next House,

953
00:54:29,268 --> 00:54:31,571
And Land Right Back
On The Road Below.

954
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:34,072
Fun?

955
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:38,243
Yeah. Fun.

956
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:42,581
Well, If You Don't Mind
Coming Back From Fantasy
Land For A Minute...

957
00:54:42,581 --> 00:54:45,684
This Is About Winning.

958
00:54:45,684 --> 00:54:47,187
Not Fun.

959
00:54:48,187 --> 00:54:50,923
Oh, This Is Just Great.

960
00:54:50,923 --> 00:54:52,958
I Guess They'll Let
Anybody Skate Here.

961
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:55,561
What Are You Guys,
Following Us?

962
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:56,962
We Came To Use The
Downhill Course.

963
00:54:56,962 --> 00:54:59,063
Well, When We're Done
With It, It's All Yours.

964
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:01,600
When's That
Gonna Be?

965
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,736
After The Championship.

966
00:55:03,736 --> 00:55:06,038
Come On Now, Run Along.

967
00:55:06,038 --> 00:55:07,206
This Is A Free
Country.

968
00:55:07,206 --> 00:55:09,575
We Can Be Here
If We Want.

969
00:55:09,575 --> 00:55:11,210
If You Don't Like It Here,

970
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,212
Why Don't You Go
Back To Mexico?

971
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:16,348
<I>I'm From Peru, Estupido.</I>

972
00:55:16,348 --> 00:55:19,685
I'll Make You A Deal.

973
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:22,688
How About We Race To See
Who Stays And Who Goes?

974
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:25,924
One Of You Against One Of Us.

975
00:55:25,924 --> 00:55:28,059
Come On, Man. Just
Let 'Em Have It.

976
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:30,262
Why Don't You Just
Stay Out Of This?

977
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:32,131
Yeah. We Can Handle
Ourselves.

978
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:33,332
Well, Let's See. Who's
Skating For Your Crew?

979
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:33,768
Me.

980
00:55:35,768 --> 00:55:36,604
Cool.

981
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:39,805
You Ready?

982
00:55:39,805 --> 00:55:41,306
What?

983
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:42,808
You Against
Gabriella.

984
00:55:42,808 --> 00:55:45,110
Whoever Loses
Has To Take Off.

985
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,112
And You Better
Not Lose, Man.

986
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:49,948
Come On, Man. You
Can't Make Me Do That.

987
00:55:49,948 --> 00:55:50,983
Come On, Man.

988
00:55:50,983 --> 00:55:52,257
What, Are You Afraid?

989
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:00,959
I'm Not Skating
Against You.

990
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:03,630
Why Not? You've Been
Doing It For Weeks.

991
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,199
Cool. We'll Go Down
To The Beach.

992
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:08,901
First One There Wins.

993
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:10,702
I'll Skate Down To
The Finish Line

994
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:12,206
To Make Sure There's
No Cheating.

995
00:56:14,206 --> 00:56:16,642
There's A Big Turn
Just Before Ketner.

996
00:56:16,642 --> 00:56:18,012
Stay On The Outside.

997
00:56:20,012 --> 00:56:21,148
What? Wait. Wait.

998
00:56:23,148 --> 00:56:25,419
You Never Stay On The
Outside Of A Turn.

999
00:56:27,419 --> 00:56:29,228
Just Do It.

1000
00:56:36,228 --> 00:56:38,363
Gabriella, Please
Don't Do This.

1001
00:56:38,363 --> 00:56:40,365
When You Woke Up This Morning,

1002
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:41,700
Did You Say To Yourself,

1003
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,435
"Today, I'm Gonna Talk,"

1004
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:45,771
Or "Today, I'm Gonna Skate"?

1005
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:48,707
Ok. On Your
Marks!

1006
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:49,708
Get Set.

1007
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:50,976
And, Don't Hold Back.

1008
00:56:50,976 --> 00:56:51,742
Go!

1009
00:57:23,742 --> 00:57:24,502
Did You See That!

1010
00:57:50,502 --> 00:57:52,404
Gabriella, Move To The Outside!

1011
00:57:52,404 --> 00:57:53,373
Yeah, Right.

1012
00:57:54,373 --> 00:57:55,752
Aaah!

1013
00:58:06,752 --> 00:58:08,421
Oooh!

1014
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:10,856
Oh, Man!

1015
00:58:10,856 --> 00:58:11,957
Gabriella!

1016
00:58:11,957 --> 00:58:13,292
Gabriella!

1017
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,193
Gabby...

1018
00:58:15,193 --> 00:58:16,795
What Happened?

1019
00:58:16,795 --> 00:58:17,896
Val?

1020
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:18,830
I Don't Know.

1021
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,232
Gabriella?

1022
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:21,201
She's Hurt, Man.

1023
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:25,340
Oh, No.

1024
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,975
How's She Doing?

1025
00:59:02,975 --> 00:59:04,242
Not Dead.

1026
00:59:04,242 --> 00:59:07,379
It's All My Fault.

1027
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:08,847
You Got That Right.

1028
00:59:08,847 --> 00:59:11,397
Come On, Jordy.

1029
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:27,467
Hello, Brink.

1030
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:30,202
Hi, Mrs. Dellama.

1031
00:59:30,202 --> 00:59:32,571
How's She Doing?

1032
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:35,841
Thank God, Gabriella's
Doing Fine.

1033
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,242
Nothing's Broken.

1034
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:40,979
The Doctor Says She Needs
To Stay In Bed For Awhile.

1035
00:59:40,979 --> 00:59:42,450
I'm Glad She's Ok.

1036
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,452
Maybe You Should Come In

1037
00:59:47,452 --> 00:59:49,221
And Say Hello To Her.

1038
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:51,140
It's Ok. Come On.

1039
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,419
Gabby?

1040
01:00:20,419 --> 01:00:22,187
I'm Really Sorry.

1041
01:00:22,187 --> 01:00:25,590
I Honestly Didn't Think
Anyone Would Get Hurt.

1042
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,930
Then I Guess For Once You
Didn't Think Of Everything.

1043
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,232
But, Gab, You Gotta
Understand--

1044
01:00:34,232 --> 01:00:37,269
You Were The One Who Told
Me About Soul Skating.

1045
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:39,571
About Skating From The Heart,

1046
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:43,475
And Only Skating
For The Love Of It.

1047
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:47,412
And I Believed You Because
You Were My Friend.

1048
01:00:47,412 --> 01:00:49,014
But It Was Only Gonna
Be For A Little While.

1049
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:53,585
My Family Really
Needed The Money.

1050
01:00:53,585 --> 01:00:55,320
We All Need The Money, Brink.

1051
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,296
What's That Have To
Do With It?

1052
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:06,932
That's How It
Starts, You Know?

1053
01:01:06,932 --> 01:01:12,270
First You Do Something
That You Really Love,

1054
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:15,974
And Then You Start Doing
It For The Money.

1055
01:01:15,974 --> 01:01:19,144
And Before You Know It,

1056
01:01:19,144 --> 01:01:23,607
You're Just Another Sell-Out.

1057
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:49,476
Yo.

1058
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:53,381
Hey, Dad.

1059
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:57,016
What Are You Doing?

1060
01:01:58,016 --> 01:02:02,756
Just Looking At
My Old Skates.

1061
01:02:04,756 --> 01:02:07,692
Why Did You And Mom
Save All These?

1062
01:02:07,692 --> 01:02:09,094
I Don't Know.

1063
01:02:09,094 --> 01:02:13,599
Maybe We Were Planning
On Having Another Kid.

1064
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:17,469
Or Maybe Just Because We're
A Couple Of Pack Rats

1065
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:19,242
That Never Throw
Away Anything.

1066
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:26,244
I Remember When I
Got You These.

1067
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:32,284
You Were Four, Maybe
Five, Years Old.

1068
01:02:32,284 --> 01:02:35,287
I Figured, Hell,
I Liked Skating,

1069
01:02:35,287 --> 01:02:37,025
Maybe He Will Too.

1070
01:02:40,025 --> 01:02:45,132
Of Course I Didn't Know It Was
Going To Take Over Your Life.

1071
01:02:47,132 --> 01:02:49,807
Me Neither.

1072
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,412
How's Gabriella?

1073
01:03:00,412 --> 01:03:02,416
Mom Called
Jordy's Mother.

1074
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:07,118
You Were Racing?

1075
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:10,222
I Didn't Listen To You, Dad.

1076
01:03:10,222 --> 01:03:13,360
I Tried Out For The
Sponsored Team.

1077
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,596
But I Told You No.

1078
01:03:17,596 --> 01:03:20,375
We Needed The Money.

1079
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:35,747
Not So Bad, Buddy, That We
Needed You To Disobey Us.

1080
01:03:35,747 --> 01:03:38,720
I Know.

1081
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,156
I Guess It Wasn't Just
For The Money Either.

1082
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:49,294
I Wanted To Be A
Part Of Team X-Bladz.

1083
01:03:49,294 --> 01:03:52,564
I Wanted To Have My
Picture In Every Magazine.

1084
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:55,105
I Wanted To Be Somebody.

1085
01:04:00,105 --> 01:04:02,409
I Don't Know If You Get That.

1086
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:08,446
You Know, You And Me,

1087
01:04:08,446 --> 01:04:11,418
We're A Lot Alike.

1088
01:04:13,418 --> 01:04:16,623
I Used To Love Being
Construction Foreman.

1089
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:20,659
"Hi. How Ya Doin'?

1090
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:22,494
I'm Ralph Brinker.
I'm The Construction
Foreman."

1091
01:04:22,494 --> 01:04:25,297
I Used To Love
Saying That.

1092
01:04:25,297 --> 01:04:26,765
People Looked Up To Me.

1093
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:29,901
Then I Got Injured.

1094
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:33,438
Suddenly, No More
Construction Foreman.

1095
01:04:33,438 --> 01:04:37,309
You Want To Know The
Worst Part Of Being
On Disability?

1096
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:40,211
I Didn't Know Who
I Was Anymore.

1097
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:42,580
I Used To Define Myself

1098
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:45,550
By My Job Title.

1099
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:49,187
But, You Want To
Know Something?

1100
01:04:49,187 --> 01:04:51,489
After Being Laid Off
For Six Months,

1101
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:57,595
I Finally Figured Out...

1102
01:04:57,595 --> 01:05:01,766
That "Construction Foreman"
Is What I Do,

1103
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:03,836
Not Who I Am.

1104
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:12,577
Andy, You Are Defined By
The Company You Keep

1105
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:16,181
And How Well
You Keep It.

1106
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:20,385
Not By What You
Just Happen To Do.

1107
01:05:20,385 --> 01:05:25,590
Kids Who Skate-- Come
On, California's Filthy
With 'Em.

1108
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:31,229
But You... You Are Andy Brinker.

1109
01:05:31,229 --> 01:05:34,766
You Are A Good Son.

1110
01:05:34,766 --> 01:05:38,670
And You Are A Good Friend.

1111
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:43,475
Who Just Happens To Skate.

1112
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:46,745
And Tomorrow, If You
Never Skate Again,

1113
01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:51,328
You're Still Andy Brinker.

1114
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:08,600
I Understand There's Gonna Be A
Big Tournament This Weekend.

1115
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,535
Yeah.

1116
01:06:10,535 --> 01:06:13,371
The A.A.I.L.S. Championship.

1117
01:06:13,371 --> 01:06:16,508
Biggest National
Tournament There Is.

1118
01:06:16,508 --> 01:06:19,944
You Gonna Compete?

1119
01:06:19,944 --> 01:06:22,814
No. I Don't Think So.

1120
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:26,718
Well, If You Change Your
Mind, Let Me Know.

1121
01:06:26,718 --> 01:06:29,754
I'd Like To Watch.

1122
01:06:29,754 --> 01:06:31,856
Really?

1123
01:06:31,856 --> 01:06:33,330
Yeah. Sounds Like
A Lot Of Fun.

1124
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:44,302
Come On. Let's Split
For The Pad.

1125
01:06:44,302 --> 01:06:48,673
Come On, Dad. You
And I Both Know

1126
01:06:48,673 --> 01:06:50,380
That No One Talks
Like That Anymore.

1127
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,886
Did We Just Come Dangerously
Close To Having A Conversation?

1128
01:07:01,886 --> 01:07:04,889
Ha Ha. Yeah.
Don't Tell Mom.

1129
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,533
No Sense Getting
Her Hopes Up.

1130
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:17,704
It's About Time, Man.

1131
01:07:19,704 --> 01:07:21,639
Don't Give Me Strawberry.

1132
01:07:21,639 --> 01:07:22,774
Do I Look Like I'm
Wearing A Dress?

1133
01:07:22,774 --> 01:07:24,610
I Get Chocolate.

1134
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,780
There's Your Skates!

1135
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,615
I'm Through. I Quit.

1136
01:07:30,615 --> 01:07:32,550
Here's Your Helmet.

1137
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,752
I'd Give You Back Your
Clothes Too,

1138
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:36,921
But I Accidentally Threw
'Em In A Garbage Bin I
Saw Across The Street.

1139
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:40,492
This Is About Your Little
Friend, Isn't It?

1140
01:07:40,492 --> 01:07:42,393
You Put The Gravel
On The Road.

1141
01:07:42,393 --> 01:07:44,562
You Realize You
Coulda Killed Her?

1142
01:07:44,562 --> 01:07:48,433
Man, You Are Such A Wuss.

1143
01:07:48,433 --> 01:07:49,801
I'm The One Who Should
Be Mad At You.

1144
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:52,937
You Didn't Even Have The
Brains To Finish The Race.

1145
01:07:52,937 --> 01:07:54,839
Maybe Not,

1146
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,077
But I Do Have The Brains
To Finish This.

1147
01:07:59,077 --> 01:08:00,913
You Are So Dead!

1148
01:08:01,913 --> 01:08:04,617
Hey, Hey, Hey! Not Today!

1149
01:08:05,617 --> 01:08:09,420
Boomer, I Didn't Think
You'd Turn On Me.

1150
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,056
That's Your Problem, Man.
You Don't Think.

1151
01:08:12,056 --> 01:08:13,825
No, That's Not It.

1152
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:15,527
You Know What Your
Problem Is?

1153
01:08:15,527 --> 01:08:16,028
You're Just No Fun
To Skate With.

1154
01:08:17,028 --> 01:08:19,831
You Got Beef With Me,

1155
01:08:19,831 --> 01:08:22,433
You Take It Up With Me
Sunday At The Championship.

1156
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:25,750
Oh, We'll Get
It On For Sure.

1157
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,385
You Need More Air.

1158
01:08:40,385 --> 01:08:41,719
More Air?

1159
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:43,789
More Air.

1160
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:47,692
And, You, Peter, What's
Up With That 540?

1161
01:08:47,692 --> 01:08:49,460
I've Got A Grandmother
Back In Lima.

1162
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,029
She Can Do A 540.

1163
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:53,464
What's With
You Today?

1164
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:54,666
Yeah. If You Got Beef,

1165
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:55,600
Why Don't You
Try It Yourself?

1166
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,734
Fine.

1167
01:08:56,734 --> 01:08:58,102
Hey, Cut It Out.

1168
01:08:58,102 --> 01:08:59,606
You Know You're Not Supposed To
Skate Until The Weekend.

1169
01:09:01,606 --> 01:09:02,907
Peter, This Is Nuts.

1170
01:09:02,907 --> 01:09:05,443
Gabriella Can't Practice.
We Only Have Three People.

1171
01:09:05,443 --> 01:09:07,412
What's The Point Of
Even Competing?

1172
01:09:07,412 --> 01:09:09,180
Because It's Fun.

1173
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,624
Now Let's Quit
Complaining, And Skate.

1174
01:09:19,624 --> 01:09:21,159
Aaaah! Oooh!

1175
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:22,999
Peter!

1176
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:30,671
Oh, This Is Just Great!

1177
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:35,607
I Can't Fix This.

1178
01:09:35,607 --> 01:09:38,676
This Is Fine. Now We Don't Even
Have The Right Gear To Compete.

1179
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:39,911
This Is A Joke.

1180
01:09:39,911 --> 01:09:42,750
Do You Guys Ever
Think Of Getting
A Sponsor?

1181
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,051
Sponsors Are No Fun.

1182
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:50,659
Well, Depends On
The Sponsor.

1183
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:56,761
Thanks, But We
Already Have Shirts.

1184
01:09:56,761 --> 01:09:57,199
How About Skates?

1185
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:02,037
I Think I Got The Sizes Right.

1186
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,608
This Are New.

1187
01:10:10,608 --> 01:10:13,945
You Convinced The Dog
Groomer To Sponsor Us?

1188
01:10:13,945 --> 01:10:16,046
Well, Actually, I'm
Kinda The Sponsor.

1189
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,682
Kinda?

1190
01:10:17,682 --> 01:10:21,619
Well, I Kinda Got My
Pay In Advance

1191
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:23,187
So I Could Get You
Guys Some Stuff.

1192
01:10:23,187 --> 01:10:24,722
How Far In Advance?

1193
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:26,562
About Four Months.

1194
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:33,068
Well, Good Luck
On Sunday, Ok?

1195
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:38,206
Well, Hold On A Sec.

1196
01:10:42,206 --> 01:10:44,178
Did You Really Throw That
Vanilla Shake In Val's Face?

1197
01:10:47,178 --> 01:10:48,781
Chocolate.

1198
01:10:49,781 --> 01:10:51,649
How Did It Feel?

1199
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:55,791
It Was Cool And It Was
So Suh-Weet!

1200
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:03,795
So...Uh...

1201
01:11:03,795 --> 01:11:06,864
Well, You See, What
Peter's Trying To
Say Is That...

1202
01:11:06,864 --> 01:11:08,667
Well...

1203
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,773
What Are You Doing On Sunday?

1204
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,074
<I> [ Announcer ]

1210
01:11:27,285 --> 01:11:29,854
Hey, Check It

1211
01:11:29,854 --> 01:11:32,623
Oh, Man, This Is
The Big Time.

1212
01:11:32,623 --> 01:11:35,059
We've Got Every Magazine
Covering This.

1213
01:11:35,059 --> 01:11:37,795
We've Got Scouts From All The
Biggest Companies Watching.

1214
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:39,797
Hey, That Doesn't
Matter. Right, Guys?

1215
01:11:39,797 --> 01:11:41,132
We're In This
For The Fun.

1216
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:42,967
We're Soul Skaters.

1217
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:43,735
Soul Skaters.

1218
01:11:43,735 --> 01:11:44,669
Yeah, Brothers.

1219
01:11:44,669 --> 01:11:46,671
Oh, My Gosh!

1220
01:11:46,671 --> 01:11:50,174
It's Team Pup 'N Suds!

1221
01:11:50,174 --> 01:11:52,243
I Heard About You Guys.

1222
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:54,213
You Guys Get
Paid In Kibble &
Bits, Right?

1223
01:11:55,213 --> 01:11:58,316
Now I Want You Guys To
Practice Saying This.

1224
01:11:58,316 --> 01:12:04,789
Really, We Tried, But
We're Just Too Lame.

1225
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:08,334
At Least We Had
A Good Time.

1226
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:18,303
I Think They Like Us.

1227
01:12:19,303 --> 01:12:21,205
Let's Get Out Of Here.

1228
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:23,708
<I> Announcer:
In The Championship Format,

<I> From Street/Vert Counts
Toward The Team Total.</I>

1230
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,845

Will Select A Skater</I>

1231
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:29,014
<I> For A Head-To-Head Race
In The Downhill.</I>

1232
01:12:30,014 --> 01:12:32,216
<I> Let's Get Right To The
Street Competition.</I>

1233
01:12:32,216 --> 01:12:33,384
All Right, Gabriella,

1234
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:35,820
Show 'Em What Soul
Skating's All About!

1235
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,957
She Hasn't Trained In Four
Days. She's Got Nothing.

1236
01:12:39,957 --> 01:12:41,692
<I> Our First Skater Up, A
Virtual Unknown</I>

1237
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:44,863
<I> Gabriella Dellama From
Team Pup 'N Suds.</I>

1238
01:12:45,863 --> 01:12:48,132
<I> Wow. Coming In A Nice Crab.</I>

1239
01:12:48,132 --> 01:12:50,234
<I> One Of The Few Girls Out Here,</I>

1240
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:54,070
<I> Skating All The Way
Across The Course.</I>

1241
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,840
<I> We Don't Know A Whole
Lot About This Team</I>

1242
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,675
<I> But Beautiful Top Soul.</I>

1243
01:12:57,675 --> 01:13:01,078
<I> Nice Style On The Mini Ramp.</I>

1244
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:03,347
Yeah, Gabriella! Come On!

1245
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:05,650
<I> And A Great Run So Far</I>

1246
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:08,020
<I> From An Unknown Skater.</I>

1247
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:13,224
<I> Nice Style There. The
Liu Kang Grab Transfer.</I>

1248
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:16,092
<I> And A 540 Upping
The Difficulty.</I>

1249
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:19,797
<I>She Has Time For One More Trick
With Less Than Five Seconds.</I>

1250
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:23,134
<I> A Huge 540 Liu Kang Grab.</I>

1251
01:13:23,134 --> 01:13:26,704
<I> Excellent Style!
Solid First Run!</I>

1252
01:13:26,704 --> 01:13:29,875
Yeah!

1253
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:34,378
<I> A 93. Next Up, Val Horrigan.</I>

1254
01:13:34,378 --> 01:13:36,881
<I> Here Stands The Nation's
Top-Ranked Skater</I>

1255
01:13:36,881 --> 01:13:38,316
<I> On The Top-Ranked Team.</I>

1256
01:13:38,316 --> 01:13:39,219
<I> Prepare To Be Dazzled.</I>

1257
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:43,821
<I> Val Horrigan Going Off.</I>

1258
01:13:43,821 --> 01:13:45,823
<I> He Does More Big Tricks</I>

1259
01:13:45,823 --> 01:13:48,895
<I> Than Anyone Else In The
Same Amount Of Time.</I>

1260
01:13:50,895 --> 01:13:55,299
<I> Such A Beautiful Mixture Of
Airs, Grinds, And Spins.</I>

1261
01:13:55,299 --> 01:13:57,371
<I> Nice Consistency.</I>

1262
01:14:00,371 --> 01:14:02,707
<I> An Incredible Run.</I>

1263
01:14:02,707 --> 01:14:04,942
<I> Probably The Top
One So Far Today.</I>

1264
01:14:04,942 --> 01:14:06,078
<I> A 98! Exactly
What He Deserves.</I>

1265
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:10,215
<I> Next Up, Andy Brinker,
Team Pup 'N Suds.</I>

1266
01:14:11,215 --> 01:14:12,984
<I> We've Seen Him Skate Before.</I>

1267
01:14:12,984 --> 01:14:14,219
<I> He's Not That Well Known,</I>

1268
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,487
<I> But He Always Seems To Do
Well In The Competition.</I>

1269
01:14:16,487 --> 01:14:19,357
<I> Brink's The Guy Who's
Gonna Definitely Try</I>

1270
01:14:19,357 --> 01:14:21,225
<I> To Use The Course A
Little Bit Differently</I>

1271
01:14:21,225 --> 01:14:22,994
<I> Than Any Of The Other Skaters.</I>

1272
01:14:22,994 --> 01:14:25,830
<I> He's A Very Creative Skater.</I>

1273
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,099
<I>Now Coming Up To The Boardwalk.</I>

1274
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:31,836
<I> This Is What I Was
Talking About, Going
Into The Mini Ramp.</I>

1275
01:14:31,836 --> 01:14:34,839
<I> Huge Transfer Backing
It Up With A Huge Gap</I>

1276
01:14:34,839 --> 01:14:36,207
<I> All The Way To The Bank.</I>

1277
01:14:36,207 --> 01:14:38,242
<I> Brink Skating With
Tons Of Speed,</I>

1278
01:14:38,242 --> 01:14:39,944
<I> Setting Up For A Soul Grind--</I>

1279
01:14:39,944 --> 01:14:40,778
<I> Aah.</I>

1280
01:14:40,778 --> 01:14:42,981
Yeah. Go Soul Skaters.

1281
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,349
<I> With Falls Like That,</I>

1282
01:14:45,349 --> 01:14:47,385
<I> It Is Gonna Be Difficult To
Compete With The Other Skaters</I>

1283
01:14:47,385 --> 01:14:49,520
<I> Having Such Flawless
Runs Here Today.</I>

1284
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,989
<I> Brink Losing His Rhythm.</I>

1285
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:54,792
<I> He's Got To Put Something
Together Here To Stay
Competitive.</I>

1286
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:57,962
<I> A Nice Royale All The
Way Down The Rail.</I>

1287
01:14:57,962 --> 01:15:01,966
<I> And Another Royale
Into The Mini Ramp.</I>

1288
01:15:01,966 --> 01:15:03,834
<I> Brink, Able To Come
Back In The Groove,</I>

1289
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,970
<I>Finishing With A Nice Mid Vert.</I>

1290
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,440
Wooooo!

1291
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,509
<I>He Looks Slightly Disappointed.</I>

1292
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:15,546
<I> A Score Of 89 For Brink.</I>

1293
01:15:15,546 --> 01:15:16,948
Mom! Katie!

1294
01:15:16,948 --> 01:15:18,349
Yeah.

1295
01:15:18,349 --> 01:15:21,285
Are You Ok? That
Was A Great Run.

1296
01:15:21,285 --> 01:15:23,321
Yeah, But I Got
Worked On That Fall.

1297
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:24,989
But It's Ok. We'll
Make It Up.

1298
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:26,791
Where's Dad?

1299
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:28,859
Oh, He'll Be Here.

1300
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:30,194
He Got Called Down To
The Construction Site.

1301
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:32,330
Mr. Beckman Wants To Talk
To Him About Something.

1302
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:34,899
Is That Good?

1303
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:37,969
Well, We'll Find
Out, Huh?

1304
01:15:37,969 --> 01:15:40,939
Hey, Can I Give
You Some Advice?

1305
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:43,808
Skate Better.

1306
01:15:43,808 --> 01:15:47,111
Skate Better...

1307
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:48,346
Skate Better!

1308
01:15:48,346 --> 01:15:49,847
Mom, Skate Better!

1309
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:50,848
Well, There You Are.

1310
01:15:50,848 --> 01:15:52,316
All I Have To Do
Is Skate Better.

1311
01:15:52,316 --> 01:15:56,413
Come On. Let's Go Watch
Him Skate Better.

1312
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:24,274
Come On! Woooo!

1313
01:16:50,274 --> 01:16:53,411
<I> And A Huge Stylish Flyfish.</I>

1314
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:55,413
<I> With Runs Like This,</I>

1315
01:16:55,413 --> 01:16:58,916
<I> Team Pup 'N Suds Is Definitely
The Surprise Here Today.</I>

1316
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:02,153
<I> A Score Of 97 Puts
'Em In Fourth Place.</I>

1317
01:17:02,153 --> 01:17:04,055
Fourth Place?

1318
01:17:04,055 --> 01:17:06,123
That's All Right,

1319
01:17:06,123 --> 01:17:07,425
And Besides, We Got
The Vert Coming Up.

1320
01:17:07,425 --> 01:17:09,627
You Know We Rule
On The Vert.

1321
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:13,064
And, Pete, Man, I'm
Gonna Need An Awesome
540 Out Of You, Ok?

1322
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:14,365
You Got It, Bud.

1323
01:17:14,365 --> 01:17:15,133
You Can Do It!

1324
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:17,968
<I> The Vert Event Is Next.</I>

1325
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:20,271
<I> Team X-Bladz Has The
Commanding Lead.</I>

1326
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:22,406
<I> But There Are Many Teams
Battling For Second</I>

1327
01:17:22,406 --> 01:17:25,076
<I> And A Spot In The
Grueling Downhill.</I>

1328
01:17:25,076 --> 01:17:25,076
Hey.

1329
01:17:25,543 --> 01:17:26,145
Hey. Well?

1330
01:17:28,145 --> 01:17:29,447
Oh, No, Ralph...

1331
01:17:29,447 --> 01:17:31,282
They're Gonna Let You Go?

1332
01:17:31,282 --> 01:17:32,450
I Start Again On Monday.

1333
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:34,553
Oh, My Gosh!

1334
01:17:35,553 --> 01:17:37,556
I'm So Happy!

1335
01:17:38,556 --> 01:17:39,457
Ow!

1336
01:17:39,457 --> 01:17:41,264
Don't Scare Me Like That.

1337
01:17:47,264 --> 01:17:49,133
Ok. There He Is.

1338
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:49,537
Go, Brink!

1339
01:17:53,537 --> 01:17:55,673
<I> Team Pup 'N Suds, You're Up.</I>

1340
01:17:55,673 --> 01:17:58,609
<I> Skating First Is Andy
"Brink" Brinker.</I>

1341
01:17:58,609 --> 01:18:00,346
Yeah Brink!

1342
01:18:02,346 --> 01:18:05,983
<I>He Has Some Making Up To Do For
That Fall In The Street Run</I>

1343
01:18:05,983 --> 01:18:08,419
<I> But Starts It Off With
A Nice, Solid Invert.</I>

1344
01:18:08,419 --> 01:18:11,989
<I> Brink's Starting To Get
High In The Air.</I>

1345
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:14,658
<I> A Huge Safety Grab 540</I>

1346
01:18:14,658 --> 01:18:16,594
<I> Well Over Head High.</I>

1347
01:18:16,594 --> 01:18:22,399
<I> Back-To-Back 540S Right
Into Another 540 Unnatural.</I>

1348
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:24,502
<I> Spinning His
Opposite Direction,</I>

1349
01:18:24,502 --> 01:18:26,003
<I> Now Working The Coping.</I>

1350
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:29,740
<I> With A Run Like This,
Team Pup 'N Suds</I>

1351
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,542
<I> Could Be Today's Wild Card.</I>

1352
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:36,290
<I> A Huge 900 Two And A
Half Full Spins!</I>

1353
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:49,092
<I> An Awesome Run From
Andy Brinker</I>

1354
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:52,663
<I> And Today's Longshot
Team, Team Pup 'N Suds.</I>

1355
01:18:52,663 --> 01:18:56,233
<I> Their Chance To Make It To The
Downhill Slight But Possible.</I>

1356
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,403
<I> And With A Score Of A
98, It Could Happen.</I>

1357
01:18:59,403 --> 01:19:01,272
That's My Boy!

1358
01:19:01,272 --> 01:19:03,542
He Was All Over That Ramp!

1359
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:08,679
<I> Up Next, Val Horrigan,
Team X-Bladz.</I>

1360
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:09,782
All Right!

1361
01:19:11,782 --> 01:19:15,719
<I> Team X-Bladz Is Running Away
With Yet Another Competition.</I>

1362
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:19,724
<I> Val Horrigan Is Very
Comfortable Being In
First Place.</I>

1363
01:19:20,724 --> 01:19:23,296
<I> And In Typical
Form, The Huge Air.</I>

1364
01:19:25,296 --> 01:19:28,599
<I> Mixing It Up, Getting
Very Acrobatic.</I>

1365
01:19:28,599 --> 01:19:32,036
<I> Val Is One Of Those Skaters So
Comfortable With The Spins.</I>

1366
01:19:32,036 --> 01:19:33,506
<I> Great Orientation
On The Half Pipe.</I>

1367
01:19:35,506 --> 01:19:38,546
<I> Some Difficult Tricks
But No Coping Tricks.</I>

1368
01:19:42,546 --> 01:19:44,515
<I> And It's That Lack
Of Lip Tricks</I>

1369
01:19:44,515 --> 01:19:45,816
<I> That Might Have Cost
Him A Couple Of Points.</I>

1370
01:19:45,816 --> 01:19:48,793
<I> He Ends With Still A
High Score. A 97.</I>

1371
01:20:29,793 --> 01:20:32,162
<I> Another Great Run For
Team Pup 'N Suds,</I>

1372
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:33,330
<I> But It's Not Gonna Be Enough.</I>

1373
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:35,299
<I> If Ben Kelly From Team G-Force</I>

1374
01:20:35,299 --> 01:20:36,867
<I> Can Even Pull Off A
Reasonable One,</I>

1375
01:20:36,867 --> 01:20:39,670
<I> It's Gonna Be G-Force Vs
X-Bladz In The Downhill.</I>

1376
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,672
Kelly's Been Nailing
It All Day.

1377
01:20:41,672 --> 01:20:43,110
Well, It Ain't Over Till
It's Over. Right, Man?

1378
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,313
Well, That's It For Us.

1379
01:20:49,313 --> 01:20:51,215
<I> And A Great Carving 540.</I>

1380
01:20:51,215 --> 01:20:53,417
<I> Over Rotates And
Goes Down Hard.</I>

1381
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:55,185
<I>All The Way To The Flat Bottom.</I>

1382
01:20:55,185 --> 01:21:00,224
<I> And He's Completely Off
The Ramp, Not Moving,</I>

1383
01:21:00,224 --> 01:21:02,695
<I> Being Attended Right
Now By The Medics.</I>

1384
01:21:04,695 --> 01:21:08,165
<I> He Rises To His Feet. He's Ok.</I>

1385
01:21:08,165 --> 01:21:09,333
<I> Getting The Support
Of The Crowd.</I>

1386
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:12,303
<I> An Unfortunate Circumstance
For Team G-Force.</I>

1387
01:21:12,303 --> 01:21:14,471
<I> However, An Opportunity
For Team Pup 'N Suds</I>

1388
01:21:14,471 --> 01:21:16,440
<I> With One Skater To Go.</I>

1389
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,175
Dad, We Can Win.

1390
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:20,210
We Can Win Now?

1391
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:22,146
We Can Win.

1392
01:21:22,146 --> 01:21:23,814
All Right, Peter, Man,

1393
01:21:23,814 --> 01:21:25,449
Not To Put Any
Pressure On You--

1394
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:26,617
I Know. I Know.

1395
01:21:26,617 --> 01:21:28,856
Come On, Peter.

1396
01:21:32,856 --> 01:21:35,726
<I> Next Up, Peter Calhoun.</I>

1397
01:21:35,726 --> 01:21:38,662
<I> Peter Calhoun Is Going To Need
The Run Of All Runs</I>

1398
01:21:38,662 --> 01:21:41,733
<I>If He's Gonna Bring Team Pup 'N
Suds To The Downhill Race.</I>

1399
01:21:42,733 --> 01:21:45,436
<I> Starting Off With
Huge Amplitude.</I>

1400
01:21:45,436 --> 01:21:49,473
<I> Everything He Does, He's Gonna
Try To Do Well Overhead.</I>

1401
01:21:49,473 --> 01:21:52,276
<I> Back-To-Back Airs,</I>

1402
01:21:52,276 --> 01:21:54,345
<I> Good Definition On The Grabs,</I>

1403
01:21:54,345 --> 01:21:58,415
<I> And A Huge 920 But
Lands Awfully Low.</I>

1404
01:21:58,415 --> 01:22:02,455
<I> With That Low Landing
He's Gonna Have To Pull
Something Incredible.</I>

1405
01:22:04,455 --> 01:22:06,692
Here Comes Our 540.

1406
01:22:08,692 --> 01:22:11,595
<I> There It Is! The
Incredible Trick--</I>

1407
01:22:11,595 --> 01:22:16,200
<I> An Inverted 540 Which
Lands Up High On The Vert.</I>

1408
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,303
<I> One And A Half Full Body
Rotations, Completely
Upside Down.</I>

1409
01:22:19,303 --> 01:22:21,238
<I> Beautiful Style.</I>

1410
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:24,508
<I> Peter Calhoun Mixing It Up
With Spins, Huge Airs--</I>

1411
01:22:24,508 --> 01:22:26,848
<I>He Could Very Well Be Bringing
Team Pup 'N Suds To The Finals.</I>

1412
01:22:30,848 --> 01:22:34,652
<I> 98! They Have Done It!</I>

1413
01:22:35,652 --> 01:22:39,456
<I> What A Great Way To End
The Vert Championships!</I>

1414
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:41,792
<I> Downhill, Last Run.</I>

1415
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:45,596
<I> It's Gonna Be One Skater From
Pup 'N Suds Vs One Skater</I>

1416
01:22:45,596 --> 01:22:48,766
<I> From X-Bladz On A
Treacherous Downhill Race.</I>

1417
01:22:48,766 --> 01:22:50,770
<I> Winner Takes All.</I>

1418
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,872
Welcome To The Friendship
Bell Downhill.

1419
01:22:54,872 --> 01:22:57,574
This Is The Most Dangerous
Course In Competition Today,

1420
01:22:57,574 --> 01:23:00,544
Ok, Guys, We Did It.

1421
01:23:00,544 --> 01:23:02,780
We Came This Far And I'm Not
Gonna Let You Guys Down.

1422
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,914
Do You Hear Me?

1423
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:05,916
Just Remember One Thing--

1424
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:10,421
Win Or Lose, Skating
Is What We Do,

1425
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:11,855
Not Who We Are.

1426
01:23:11,855 --> 01:23:13,857
Man, That Was Like Deep.

1427
01:23:13,857 --> 01:23:16,260
Pup 'N Suds, You Guys
Have One Minute.

1428
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,895
Ok, Dude.
This Is It.

1429
01:23:17,895 --> 01:23:18,829
Good Luck.

1430
01:23:18,829 --> 01:23:19,663
We'll See You At The Bottom.

1431
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:20,569
All Right, Man.

1432
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:28,338
You Know, Before I Just
Wanted To Beat You.

1433
01:23:28,338 --> 01:23:30,307
Now I'm Gonna Humiliate You.

1434
01:23:30,307 --> 01:23:32,010
You Ever Hear That
Winning Isn't
Everything?

1435
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:34,445
Oh, Sure.

1436
01:23:34,445 --> 01:23:35,979
Didn't Believe It Then,

1437
01:23:35,979 --> 01:23:37,514
And I Don't Believe It Now.

1438
01:23:37,514 --> 01:23:39,451
And Neither Do You.

1439
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:42,286
Yeah, I Wanna Win.

1440
01:23:42,286 --> 01:23:45,489
But No Matter What, Win Or Lose,

1441
01:23:45,489 --> 01:23:48,492
At The End Of The Day
I'm Not You.

1442
01:23:48,492 --> 01:23:50,696
So It's Still A Good Day.

1443
01:23:52,696 --> 01:23:56,380
<I> Skaters, To Your Marks.</I>

1444
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,631
<I> Get Set.</I>

1445
01:24:27,631 --> 01:24:30,073
Come On, Buddy!
You Can Do It!

1446
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:40,811
<I> Both Skaters Just Flying Down
The Course, Neck And Neck,</I>

1447
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:44,081
<I> This Is The Section In The
Course Where The Top Speeds
Will Be Reached.</I>

1448
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:46,884
<I> Both Totally In A Tuck.</I>

1449
01:24:46,884 --> 01:24:48,585
<I> Whoever Can Be The
Most Aerodynamic</I>

1450
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:49,455
<I> Is Gonna Start To Pull Away.</I>

1451
01:24:51,455 --> 01:24:53,524
<I> 42.5 Miles Per Hours!</I>

1452
01:24:53,524 --> 01:24:54,402
<I> That Is A New Course Record.</I>

1453
01:25:05,402 --> 01:25:06,870
Yeaaa!

1454
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:41,705
Go, My Man Val!

1455
01:25:41,705 --> 01:25:44,042
Jordy, Man, My
Arm's Going Numb.

1456
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:47,578
Where Did He Go?

1457
01:25:47,578 --> 01:25:49,764
There's A Blind
Turn. We'll See 'Em
In A Minute.

1458
01:26:07,764 --> 01:26:08,973
Is That All You Got?

1459
01:26:15,973 --> 01:26:17,042
Oooh!

1460
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:23,816
Dude, Are You Ok?

1461
01:26:25,816 --> 01:26:27,051
Come On. Let's Get
You Out Of Here.

1462
01:26:29,051 --> 01:26:31,121
You Never Did Have The
Brains To Finish A Race

1463
01:26:31,121 --> 01:26:32,656
When Someone Was Down.

1464
01:26:32,656 --> 01:26:33,525
I Guess Not.

1465
01:26:35,525 --> 01:26:37,768
That's What I Was
Counting On.

1466
01:26:44,768 --> 01:26:45,602
Get It?

1467
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:46,982
You Bet. I Got It All.

1468
01:26:58,982 --> 01:27:01,986
<I> As Expected, Val
Horrigan In The Lead.</I>

1469
01:27:02,986 --> 01:27:05,087
<I> A Huge Air Out Of The Alley,</I>

1470
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:07,260
<I> Coming Out Of Nowhere,
And They're Back.</I>

1471
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,895
My Move! My Move!

1472
01:27:11,895 --> 01:27:14,598
<I> Back To The Neck-And-Neck
Position They've Had
Throughout The Race,</I>

1473
01:27:14,598 --> 01:27:16,913
<I> It's Into The Tucks.</I>

1474
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:31,248
<I> This Is It-- A Dead Sprint.</I>

1475
01:27:31,248 --> 01:27:33,850
<I> This Is All Heart.</I>

1476
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:36,657
<I>Both Skaters Totally Exhausted.</I>

1477
01:27:40,657 --> 01:27:43,794
<I> Oh, Yes!</I>

1478
01:27:43,794 --> 01:27:45,696
<I> They've Done It!</I>

1479
01:27:45,696 --> 01:27:48,032
<I> Team Pup 'N Suds From Behind
Grabs The Championship!</I>

1480
01:27:49,032 --> 01:27:51,868
<I> An Incredible Finish!</I>

1481
01:27:51,868 --> 01:27:53,571
Katie!

1482
01:27:54,571 --> 01:27:55,572
How Does It Feel?

1483
01:27:55,572 --> 01:27:57,558
It Feels Great, Dad!

1484
01:28:14,558 --> 01:28:16,660
Hey, I Didn't Know Val Would
Do Something Like That, Man.

1485
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:17,694
I'm Sorry.

1486
01:28:17,694 --> 01:28:18,895
Yeah, Man. Me Too.

1487
01:28:18,895 --> 01:28:20,864
It's Ok. You Guys
Didn't Know.

1488
01:28:20,864 --> 01:28:22,099
Hey, We Need
To Talk.

1489
01:28:22,099 --> 01:28:24,067
Listen. Val's Out.

1490
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:25,335
Cheating's A Bad Thing.

1491
01:28:25,335 --> 01:28:26,236
You, You're In.

1492
01:28:26,236 --> 01:28:28,305
You're My Man.

1493
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:30,974
You Want Me To Be The
Captain Of Team X-Bladz?

1494
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:32,776
You Got It. Money,
Sponsorships.

1495
01:28:32,776 --> 01:28:33,910
You Know How The
Drill Works.

1496
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:34,347
Come On.
Whatta Ya Say?

1497
01:28:37,347 --> 01:28:39,950
I Was On Team X-Bladz Once.

1498
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:42,020
It Wasn't Any Fun.

1499
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,904
I'm Sorry, Man. I'll
See You Around.

1500
01:29:00,904 --> 01:29:02,706
Soul Skaters!

1501
01:29:02,706 --> 01:29:05,000
There's Nothing We Can't Do!
