Have you played this game
before?

00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,166
No. No.

182
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,645
We thought of it on the way to
your house.

hours to get

Bring proof.

Oh, please.

How are we supposed to show
proof?

lies about getting laid.

says boom, everybody dies.

You're the cop, you got to
know.

doesn't mean that I know

you got your homicide,

216
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,246

around with Chase all the time.

01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,901
I should just cut you up.

1072
01:02:10,944 --> 01:02:14,469
But I think I'd rather see your
brain splatter everywhere.

Ciao.

Drop the knife now.

Put it down. Put it down.

1079
01:02:57,338 --> 01:03:00,646
Brandon, I hate you.

1080

You can get what you deserve.

1081

I'm not Brandon, I'm Chase.

1082

There's a bomb on the dresser.

Do you have a key for this
thing?

No.

Eric, Eric, Eric, there's a
bomb on the dresser.

1090
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:45,125
I know.

Hurry up.

1092
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,562
I can't get these things off.

1093

Thank God.

I didn't.

Sonja's the one that did all
this to me.

I know. I know.

It looks like Chase and Crystal
broke up.

I didn't think she'd be as
forgiving as you.

1106
01:04:32,694 --> 01:04:34,174
Well, she told me that her and
Eric have

1107

Mh-hm.

like Eric turns out to be

Yeah, but I actually feel sorry
for Sonja.

1113
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:48,623
She must've been pretty messed
up to have gone to the extremes

1114

that she did.

Yeah.

Well, maybe she was just pretty
psychotic.

1119
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:00,287
Either way she'll have plenty of
time

jail.
