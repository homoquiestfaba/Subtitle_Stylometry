1
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,522
Who are you?

2
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:06,156
I am your Guardian. As long as I live
the Horned Demon cannot come.

3
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:38,313
Where does this quote come from?
- From hell.

4
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,440
Any idea, Jamie?

5
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:47,113
I don't know any dead languages.
- He who understands can learn a lot from it.

6
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,533
It's Vergilius.
-Well done.

7
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,577
Mucus.
-Knowledge is power.

8
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,288
Blessed are the poor in spirit.

9
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,253
So this is your paper about Plato.

10
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:07,133
You can give better assignments.
- Give an example.

11
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:12,138
Macbeth.
-Nice for the Easter holidays.

12
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:16,518
A ten-page paper
about Macbeth.

13
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:22,691
Good is evil and evil is good
we rushed through fog and rain.

14
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,406
Macbeth, first company, first scene.

15
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:40,208
Monday I had breakfast with 4 slices
bacon. And bacon is fat in the canteen.

16
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:45,547
I had lunch with a puff
potato with sour cream and butter.

17
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:48,508
Just a little butter.

18
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:54,890
Tuesday I got it
a box of fudge from my grandmother.

19
00:05:56,016 --> 00:06:02,606
I intended to hand them out.
But I ate them myself in the evening.

20
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:07,319
You also have to confess sins
who are not talking about food?

21
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:14,993
As a penance you have to
five minutes on psalm 39.

22
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,330
Go and say your deed of repentance.

23
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,837
Five.

24
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:40,477
If I succeed, I want a liposuction.

25
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:45,065
Just like models from lingerie
advertisements.

26
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:48,860
What do you think?
Why am I actually asking?

27
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:52,364
What are they doing in the church?

28
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:55,534
They repair the damage
of the earthquake.

29
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,246
Will those boys stay the entire vacation?

30
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,752
Maybe I'll just stay here.
-Really? I stay too.

31
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,674
There are not enough places to sleep.
Maybe we should share a room.

32
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,259
Imagine.

33
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,980
Bless me, I have sinned.

34
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:30,443
I did a week ago
last confessed.

35
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:35,782
Since...

36
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:37,617
I doubted.

37
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:43,999
All pain leads to redemption.
-Why did God take my father?

38
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:48,628
He was fantastic,
he was always there for me.

39
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:52,215
God teaches us his lessons
in many different ways.

40
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:57,429
It's not fair.
Mama is always so busy.

41
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:03,685
She hardly has any time for me.

42
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:10,525
I don't know where I belong.

43
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:16,406
Do you understand that God?
has a plan for you.

44
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,910
Do you go during the Silent Week
to your mother?

45
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:26,750
It is a good week
to improve the relationship.

46
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:31,713
I want you to be throughout
seven minutes ...

47
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,136
reflect on the infinity of God.

48
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:46,686
Think about why Christ ...

49
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:50,357
hung on the cross.

50
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:04,913
Seven?
-That's very easy.

51
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:21,388
I've been a bad girl.
-How so?

52
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:25,141
I've been to a man.

53
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:28,728
In the carnal sense?

54
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:36,027
I don't know for sure. I think so.
Do you believe so?

55
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:39,906
I met him on the beach.

56
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:43,869
We swam together.

57
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:47,664
We didn't go far into the water.

58
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:50,959
Everyone on the beach could still see us.

59
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:55,380
He kissed me.

60
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,094
I wanted to stop him.

61
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:06,975
But it was so delicious.
He pulled my top off ...

62
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:10,437
It was wrong
but I allowed it.

63
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,110
I didn't know what to do.

64
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:21,239
I closed my eyes
and prayed for advice ...

65
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:26,828
and when I opened them again,
he had taken off his swimsuit.

66
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:36,546
You have to think of another way
deal with your family problems.

67
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:39,799
Without all these impressions.

68
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:44,262
Your lack of respect
leads you to darkness.

69
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:47,557
I have another question.

70
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:51,061
Is oral sex a pickle sin
or a capital sin?

71
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:54,522
As a penance
you stay here in church ...

72
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,153
to reflect on you for twenty minutes
on the infinity of God.

73
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:07,619
Twenty?

74
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,666
What has she done?
-What not?

75
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:44,114
Telephone for you in the office.

76
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,909
Your mom.

77
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:05,635
What's your name?
-Daniel.

78
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:13,435
That is a big tool.
-Yeah, nothing for little girls.

79
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,271
Do I look like a little girl then?

80
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:19,649
Funny.
-Do you think he is beautiful?

81
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:23,904
Yes, my 12 year old sister also has one.

82
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:26,781
Watch out with that jetty.

83
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:37,709
What is it, mama?
-I can't come for you.

84
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:42,130
I'll go by bus and train.
-No. I have little time now.

85
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:48,970
I'm going to Australia with Russel.
He writes something about Aborigines or something.

86
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:53,975
It's getting serious.
You can stay in school this week.

87
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,520
You are kidding me.
-You'll be out for a weekend soon.

88
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:02,192
You can still do something about your schoolwork.
-I want to go home.

89
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,486
Don't start this way.

90
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:08,740
Oh, there is the taxi.
I'll still call.

91
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:13,036
I love you too.

92
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:17,707
Are you okay?

93
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,586
Yes, it's fine.

94
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:28,218
It's fine. I will stay here.

95
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:32,097
Fortunately the library is open.

96
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,275
Someone who stays here.

97
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:48,822
Nice. Then the problem is
with the rooms also solved.

98
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:54,369
Jamie can sleep with Faith.
- Why isn't Jamie going home?

99
00:13:54,536 --> 00:14:00,584
Last time she was bright and blue.
Her father had done that.

100
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,921
I tried to help her ...

101
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,799
but sometimes it is hopeless.

102
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:39,206
Just watch.

103
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:46,296
Her hair and her nails are
grew after her death.

104
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:49,883
She was in the outside wall,
as if it was a warning.

105
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,014
I send her to the laboratory.
Come on, let's go.

106
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,310
I am turning this area off.
You will hear from me again.

107
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:05,148
Please come with me. Remember your head.

108
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:09,778
Do you think the stories are correct?

109
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:13,657
This must be an Illuminati.
-What is that?

110
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:16,868
It used to be here at school
a poetry group.

111
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:20,247
They were called after the Illuminatis
in England.

112
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:26,836
They disappeared a hundred years ago.
- They never heard from them again.

113
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:28,713
Until today.

114
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,509
This wall is from after the fire.

115
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:40,392
The entrance from the church
is bricked up.

116
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:46,064
They have put a lot of effort into it
to close this space.

117
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:51,111
Decent work.
Did you know this was here?

118
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,364
Take a look here.

119
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:05,292
What happened here?
- I hoped you knew that.

120
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:11,172
What is this?
-It's a baptistery.

121
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,802
It's hard to see
with all those skeletons ...

122
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:20,599
but i think its here
five or six people burned.

123
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:35,030
What a boring room.
Let's hang up some things.

124
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:40,035
It's my room.
-This week is mine too.

125
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:52,339
Do not touch it.
-University of Stanford. Waiting list.

126
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:56,927
Poor study head. Not accepted.
-Not yet.

127
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:18,532
Nice view.

128
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:22,827
Shall we get their attention?

129
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,962
Put it a little harder.

130
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:51,082
The show is over.
At work, boys.

131
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,507
Come on, work.

132
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:06,014
That you dare. Suppose they see you.
-That was the intention.

133
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:10,477
A teacher or something. This is not
allowed anyway.

134
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:14,231
Do you never do something that is not allowed?
With a boy or something?

135
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,358
I do not have a boyfriend.

136
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,864
Then we have to find one for you.

137
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,784
A passionate twink.

138
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:32,415
Have you never done it before?

139
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:39,756
I can give you a few tips.

140
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:45,178
Not necessary, I have to study.
-I too, but you know ...

141
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:48,014
Working alone makes you boring.

142
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,105
We can do you
help with a new hairstyle.

143
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:58,149
And makeup.

144
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:01,945
Sexy clothes.

145
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:07,033
Do you like to see me?

146
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,953
You do have options.

147
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,372
If you do your best.

148
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,543
Do you really think so?
-Yeah, you just gotta get loose.

149
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:20,714
Then they can't keep away from you.

150
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:36,187
How is it that the hair grew through?
-Egg whites?

151
00:20:36,354 --> 00:20:39,691
In a stone wall?
-It's a well-known phenomenon.

152
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:43,361
Under the right conditions
can it happen.

153
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:46,740
Her skin has remained less beautiful.

154
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:50,118
It's enough like this. The food is
getting cold.

155
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:01,379
What shall we do?

156
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm going to remove my legs.
-There will be a nice movie again.

157
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:14,017
Don't like the diet menu?

158
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:23,693
Someone wants this
bring to Mother Clodah?

159
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:30,116
What is it late?
-We have to leave.

160
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:40,669
Can I use your computer for a moment?

161
00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:45,173
Mother Clodah is not very popular.

162
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,468
She's weird.

163
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:54,140
What do you think of me?
-You are nice. But why are you ...

164
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:57,060
Have you become a nun?
That is a logical question.

165
00:21:57,227 --> 00:22:00,522
What about then?
- I'm from an orphanage.

166
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,315
An orphanage.

167
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:08,405
Because of the sisters I have my calling
discovered and found the power of God.

168
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:14,077
I sometimes feel like an orphan.

169
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:18,623
If you want to talk to someone
you come.

170
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,878
Excuse me.

171
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:51,007
I should have listened to you.
- You're looking for a plaster.

172
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:54,052
I cannot find the first-aid kit.

173
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:58,348
We do have one. Wait a second.

174
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:09,109
Do you have him?
-Almost.

175
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:16,700
Found it. Come on.

176
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,748
Stanford?

177
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:27,919
Yes, when I got engineering
went to study.

178
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:31,214
I want that too.
How do you end up here?

179
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:37,679
I am an intern here. I learn everything about it
the restoration of historic buildings.

180
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:45,979
How strange, no one ever
had discovered that that space was there?

181
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:50,984
Yes, as if it had to remain hidden.
I want to investigate.

182
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:55,655
We have a library.
I'm sure you can do that.

183
00:24:55,822 --> 00:25:00,619
Do you have Internet?
-Yes, but you must have a password.

184
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:04,748
I want to help you.

185
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:08,418
Monday, at noon?

186
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:14,466
Nice, see you on Monday.
Good night, Faith.

187
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:18,678
Careful with your arm.
- All right, doctor.

188
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:24,559
dorms

189
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:27,145
How does such a seance go?

190
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:31,566
You talk to the dead.
It's just like a long-distance call.

191
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,860
Just lie still.

192
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:41,910
Where were you?
I don't do it anyway.

193
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:43,537
Welcome to the pleasure garden.

194
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:46,915
How was the living dead?
-With whom?

195
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:50,210
Mother Clodah.
Did she let you pray?

196
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:54,047
Or have you succeeded?
- She didn't open.

197
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:57,467
Do you have her collection
seen crucifixes?

198
00:25:57,634 --> 00:26:02,180
No vampire approaching her.
- How old would she be?

199
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:08,311
She is timeless. It never dies.
- We are not disturbing, are we?

200
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:14,317
We will cheer you up a bit.
After all, we are fellow sufferers.

201
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:17,571
Something like that never really works?

202
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:21,992
Let's try the Illuminati
to recall.

203
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:26,580
How?
-With a seance in the chapel.

204
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:32,294
Their aura is still floating around.
-It's completely dropped off there.

205
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,132
We will soon be thundering.
-What would really have happened?

206
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,634
Good idea.

207
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,804
And Sister Sherilyn?

208
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:44,431
No problem.

209
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:48,393
Our buoy queen takes care of that.

210
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:31,228
Come on, we gotta be quick.

211
00:27:31,394 --> 00:27:33,855
You get wine and a few candles.

212
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:37,609
What is it?

213
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:41,112
Do I have to go steal those things?

214
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,116
Everyone must do something.
You belong now.

215
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:49,829
Then it's going to be crazy. Forward.

216
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:52,791
All right then.

217
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:56,187
Why did you do that?
-For fun.

218
00:28:56,354 --> 00:29:00,650
That was not fun.
- Don't be so serious.

219
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:16,875
Here are the candles and here is the wine.

220
00:30:37,706 --> 00:30:40,500
Come on, Faith.
-I'm not going.

221
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,962
It was a joke. Do you find that so bad?

222
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:48,967
Do you really think you're going to hell
if you steal candles?

223
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:53,597
Are you not ashamed?
-Pious aunt.

224
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:16,036
Dark say.

225
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,618
This is <i> cool </i>.

226
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:00,705
I want to get out of here.

227
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:13,843
Let's have a drink at Father Michael.

228
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,219
What now?

229
00:32:56,386 --> 00:32:59,139
Grab each other's hands.

230
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:07,105
We greet our Illuminatis sisters.

231
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:12,652
Tell us your secrets.

232
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:18,617
Tell us how you died.
-Take us into contact with Kurt Cobain.

233
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:20,827
Seriously.

234
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:22,829
Eyes closed.

235
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:33,173
We greet our Illuminatis sisters.

236
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,594
Get up and contact us.

237
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:41,806
Come alive. Go walk again.

238
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:44,434
Go breathe again.

239
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:47,729
Greetings to you.

240
00:33:56,196 --> 00:33:58,240
It does not work.

241
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:19,052
Come out, wherever you are.
-It does not work.

242
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:23,848
We are definitely doing something wrong.
They probably don't hear us.

243
00:34:24,015 --> 00:34:26,476
I'm starting to get hungry.

244
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:31,273
We cannot reach the other side,
because ...

245
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:39,489
What are you going to do?

246
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:42,284
All modern stuff out.

247
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,411
They hamper things.

248
00:34:46,955 --> 00:34:50,667
Maybe we should
to the other side.

249
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:56,047
Hurry up.

250
00:34:56,923 --> 00:35:01,803
Doesn't everything have to go out?
-You want it to work?

251
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:44,596
I call on the spirits of the past.

252
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:48,683
Get up from your silent grave.

253
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:52,312
We greet you. Stand up.

254
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:58,068
We greet you. Stand up.

255
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,116
Are you there?

256
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:11,039
You can't go in there.

257
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:13,667
I just looked.

258
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,680
What is happening?

259
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,178
What lies there?

260
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:51,306
A book.

261
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,184
What does it say?

262
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:10,659
It is Latin. I can not read that.

263
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:13,078
I know who does.

264
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:19,251
Hey. Let me out.

265
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:29,594
I'm coming.

266
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:35,350
What a silly joke, say.

267
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,938
Where's the rest of it?

268
00:38:42,357 --> 00:38:43,775
They are...

269
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:49,197
Go to bed.
I'll come back to this tomorrow.

270
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:15,640
That lying must have ended.
I know where you have been.

271
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:20,228
I found this in the church.
And this one was under the scaffolding.

272
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:27,986
Listen carefully. You are only allowed in it
part where the altar stands.

273
00:39:28,153 --> 00:39:31,781
The rest is forbidden territory.

274
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:34,576
It is not safe there.

275
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:36,661
Is that clear?

276
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,128
I understand you well.
I was just like you.

277
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:48,840
I never let myself say anything.

278
00:39:50,508 --> 00:39:54,638
You can appreciate good advice later.

279
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:59,976
My teacher warned
always against temptation.

280
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:07,025
It seems innocent,
but don't give in.

281
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:12,155
Have I been clear?

282
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:18,912
You know that cleanliness
leads to heaven.

283
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:32,634
You don't mean this.

284
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:37,264
Do we have to clean the kitchen?
-That's necessary.

285
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:43,228
Is this to strengthen our character?
- Child labor is forbidden?

286
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:44,813
Go ahead.

287
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:56,867
I'll finish this.
You can do the fridge.

288
00:40:58,118 --> 00:40:59,953
There she goes.

289
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:29,774
I wouldn't eat that.
-What is it?

290
00:41:29,941 --> 00:41:31,443
My bait.

291
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:39,784
Is someone going to fish?
-No, thank you.

292
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:45,290
Women belong in the kitchen.
We are attacking the bacteria here.

293
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:48,293
Have a nice afternoon then.

294
00:41:49,502 --> 00:41:52,839
We found something last night.

295
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:57,677
A moldy skeleton?
-No, an old book.

296
00:41:57,844 --> 00:42:00,555
And all in Latin.

297
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:04,392
And let me read Latin.

298
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,355
You are the only one who can help us.

299
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:13,109
I think it has something
to do with the Illuminatis.

300
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:22,202
These notes were in the book.
They are from one Gertrude.

301
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:29,167
She writes that the book is her heart
ignites desire.

302
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:30,794
Sounds good, right?

303
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:35,382
We're going back tonight.
-After what happened?

304
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,928
Then you don't want to know
what happened in the past?

305
00:42:40,095 --> 00:42:42,264
Don't you like us?

306
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:48,061
Knowledge is power.
You are quite curious.

307
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:49,896
Come on.

308
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:41,031
Do you really think that Sherilyn
kicks in here?

309
00:43:41,823 --> 00:43:45,869
Of course.
And we have a secret weapon.

310
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:51,416
Crazy.
-He is on.

311
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,001
Come with me.

312
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:33,083
Mysterious.

313
00:44:35,877 --> 00:44:38,338
It is mainly Latin.

314
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:44,094
The rest is in Gaelic, I think.
-What does it say?

315
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:49,724
Who read aloud from this book,
becomes mistress of the devil.

316
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:55,939
That is not a cat piss.
-It's a book about magic.

317
00:44:56,106 --> 00:45:01,903
This is the book of the Horned
Demon, the Master of the Elements ...

318
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,032
the Lord of the Fertile Earth.
The long-awaited one.

319
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,786
Nice name
for a fertility god.

320
00:45:09,953 --> 00:45:12,414
Does he have a flat stomach?

321
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:16,293
This book brings you great power.

322
00:45:16,459 --> 00:45:21,172
The reader is required
to open the Forgotten Gate ...

323
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:25,010
making the long-awaited
will enter.

324
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:31,975
If you execute this command, the
Long awaited rising from the ocean ...

325
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:36,521
on the darkest day
of the year.

326
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:40,025
Good Friday.

327
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:43,653
That's next week.
-Crazy.

328
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,200
What must we do?
-To be severely punished ...

329
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:50,994
the Guardian, the Bearer of the Mark.

330
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:55,707
Woe to them. Their head is cut off.

331
00:45:58,418 --> 00:46:02,339
What is a Guardian?
- Someone at the court?

332
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:04,674
It is a story.

333
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:07,928
Something that happened a long time ago.

334
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:13,850
De Wachter has prevented that
the long-awaited could enter the world.

335
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:17,437
I think some pages are missing.

336
00:46:17,604 --> 00:46:19,856
We do not have all the information.

337
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:27,113
Gertrude says that ...

338
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:35,247
We must first open the gates.
-Who is Gertrude?

339
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:38,959
Miss Illuminatis 1896.

340
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:43,296
I had only taken this with me.

341
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:47,926
We need the Mirror Conspiracy
to carry out.

342
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:51,137
On Good Friday.

343
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:58,770
Read the spell over the Noordpoort.

344
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:04,568
We turn our face
to the north.

345
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:08,655
The beach is there.
-Then the north is there.

346
00:47:17,497 --> 00:47:19,666
There is the north.

347
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,251
Give it some water.

348
00:47:23,044 --> 00:47:24,462
Water.

349
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:41,313
Guard of the Noordpoort.
Send your water.

350
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:44,107
Raise your voice, o Demon.

351
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:48,695
The water
will flow through the Noordpoort.

352
00:47:48,862 --> 00:47:51,740
Accept this pure sacrifice.

353
00:47:56,286 --> 00:48:00,165
Let us witness your power.

354
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:04,669
Was that it?
-Yes. Come with me.

355
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:08,590
Has anything happened?
We will notice that.

356
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,402
It did not work.

357
00:49:03,436 --> 00:49:07,315
Foxglove.
A poisonous wild plant.

358
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:09,943
You may.
- I'll do it soon.

359
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:19,494
This is the church, isn't it?

360
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:25,834
What is so special about that?
-The baptistery is older than the rest.

361
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:29,379
Is that bad?
-No, but strange.

362
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:33,425
How can sea water be there?
end up?

363
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:37,512
In the rest of the church
there is no trace of it.

364
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:42,684
That's strange.
-On top of a hill. I don't get it.

365
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:48,398
I quit. I go back to work.

366
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:59,534
I still have to do something
for Sister Sherilyn.

367
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:23,767
Wait a moment.
-I want to test my translation program.

368
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:26,686
Not now.

369
00:50:29,105 --> 00:50:32,734
Guardian of the Zuidpoort,
show the way.

370
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:38,949
Raise your voice, o Demon.
Earth from the Zuidpoort leads us to you.

371
00:50:39,115 --> 00:50:45,288
Accept this sacrifice so that we witness
may be of your strength.

372
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,416
What is it?

373
00:50:53,964 --> 00:50:58,552
I think we have the South Gate
have opened.

374
00:51:01,847 --> 00:51:07,018
Let's hurry up.
It is almost Good Friday.

375
00:51:07,185 --> 00:51:10,146
What now?
-We have to go to the beach.

376
00:51:10,313 --> 00:51:12,357
Then my hair will frizz.

377
00:51:12,524 --> 00:51:18,280
No, it says it's at noon
afternoon must.

378
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,199
But we still need something.

379
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:24,703
Search for the spell
of the water 's up.

380
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:35,547
This is it, I believe.

381
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:39,259
You must know for sure.

382
00:51:39,426 --> 00:51:42,179
Does this not go a bit far?

383
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:46,766
Do you prefer to do something else?
With this or that?

384
00:51:49,352 --> 00:51:51,855
Well, say.

385
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:57,861
Courage is the most important virtue,
says Gertrude.

386
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:02,365
We just want to see what happens.

387
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:04,534
Good.

388
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:09,331
This will be fun.

389
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:14,377
Bergamot oil purifies the sea water.

390
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:21,968
And we need candles to
to awaken our hidden powers.

391
00:52:26,848 --> 00:52:32,312
White clothing, as old as possible,
so that our aura can go through.

392
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:43,031
Mirrors, those are the most important
for the last spell.

393
00:52:43,198 --> 00:52:45,867
He needs us
bring the long-awaited.

394
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:53,833
Now we are going to clean the ocean water,
just like a century ago.

395
00:52:55,502 --> 00:53:01,716
If you go fishing, you must first
three orphan greetings pray ...

396
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:04,761
and only then eject the line.

397
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:38,879
Manifest you, o Demon.

398
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:43,008
The water from the Zuidpoort is now
burning.

399
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:46,094
Accept this pure offering.

400
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:58,190
You have it.

401
00:54:07,365 --> 00:54:09,451
What would it be like if it worked out?

402
00:54:09,618 --> 00:54:14,539
At least I let myself be
never prescribe the law again.

403
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,294
What is a pure girl?
-A virgin.

404
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:21,254
We need that.

405
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:23,465
I know.

406
00:54:23,632 --> 00:54:26,092
And who can that be?

407
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,179
Slut.

408
00:54:30,555 --> 00:54:34,184
The Long-awaited is vain.
Hence those mirrors.

409
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:37,479
But more important than mirrors ...

410
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:40,148
Is blood. Blood from a virgin.

411
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,028
Bye, Faith.

412
00:54:49,783 --> 00:54:52,244
You don't have to drink it.

413
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:56,456
Come on in.

414
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:05,340
I'll see you there.

415
00:55:05,507 --> 00:55:06,925
We'll wait.

416
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:14,599
Daniel, do you want it again?
with me on the computer?

417
00:55:14,766 --> 00:55:16,184
Yes Nice.

418
00:55:17,644 --> 00:55:20,105
At eight o'clock tonight?

419
00:55:20,272 --> 00:55:22,107
Which is good.

420
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:25,819
Until then.

421
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:56,933
How's Daniel doing?
- I'll see him tonight.

422
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:02,022
In the library. I have asked him.

423
00:56:02,189 --> 00:56:06,943
I'm going to the library tonight.
-Stay out of this.

424
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:13,408
I just check if it's not out of control
runs. I know what type it is.

425
00:56:13,575 --> 00:56:14,993
I don't need any help.

426
00:56:19,664 --> 00:56:21,082
Do not.

427
00:56:22,209 --> 00:56:26,087
That is foxglove.
Very toxic.

428
00:57:24,563 --> 00:57:26,064
I'm Erica.

429
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:30,110
Faith sent me.

430
00:57:30,277 --> 00:57:34,948
She wants you to come to her room.
It's number 24.

431
00:57:35,115 --> 00:57:38,577
Do not be afraid.
There are no sisters.

432
00:57:57,888 --> 00:57:59,848
Kelsey, hurry up.

433
00:58:05,604 --> 00:58:08,064
I have to leave.

434
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:46,269
Where is she?

435
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:52,234
She is taking a shower.
She asked if you wanted to wait. Sit down.

436
00:58:55,028 --> 00:58:57,280
What are you going to do?

437
00:58:57,906 --> 00:58:59,324
We'll see.

438
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:10,835
Here I have them.

439
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:14,047
What the hell?

440
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:19,386
Have you never seen a girl
dress up? You have a sister, right?

441
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:22,305
You know, Faith is ...

442
00:59:30,272 --> 00:59:35,569
very sweet, but you're just not ...

443
00:59:35,735 --> 00:59:37,904
What is it? You want well.

444
00:59:38,071 --> 00:59:42,534
Not with you.
- Nobody needs to know?

445
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:50,458
I don't want to be with you.
- You are still a virgin.

446
01:00:05,056 --> 01:00:08,518
I know what it looked like ...
-Never mind.

447
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:12,397
I just sat there.
-I do not give a hoot.

448
01:00:14,149 --> 01:00:16,193
I don't want to talk about it.

449
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:32,042
I warned you.
-So that is why you went ahead.

450
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:35,170
He just dragged me on the bed.

451
01:00:35,337 --> 01:00:39,466
I do not believe you.
- You think he really wants you.

452
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:42,552
There are so many other girls.

453
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:48,558
With those talks about Stanford
he just wants to seduce you.

454
01:00:49,768 --> 01:00:52,437
Take a look outside.

455
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:07,744
What do you have? Come with me.

456
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:22,551
It is salty.

457
01:01:52,956 --> 01:01:54,374
What does it say?

458
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:58,461
"The Guardian of the Lord
warns everyone.

459
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:01,089
It will happen again. "

460
01:02:01,256 --> 01:02:05,177
Is there really a Guardian?
From meat and blood?

461
01:02:05,343 --> 01:02:10,098
Yes, and it's serious to him.
- But what does he mean by this?

462
01:02:10,265 --> 01:02:15,061
He wants us to stop.
-Why did we get the Book then?

463
01:02:15,228 --> 01:02:20,775
He sets us to the test.
To see if we are wise.

464
01:02:20,942 --> 01:02:27,115
I'm sick of everyone
always wants to test us.

465
01:02:27,282 --> 01:02:32,662
De Wachter wants to protect us.
I'm talking about adults.

466
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:37,000
They always know everything better.
They can go to hell.

467
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:42,339
Who would be the Guardian?
-The Book was talking about the Sign.

468
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:44,925
The Sign Carrier.

469
01:02:50,972 --> 01:02:54,392
Of course.
I already know who the Guardian is.

470
01:02:55,936 --> 01:02:58,396
Mother Clodah?

471
01:02:58,563 --> 01:03:01,233
What are we afraid of then?

472
01:03:01,399 --> 01:03:05,904
An old person with some crucifixes?
-What are you going to do?

473
01:03:06,988 --> 01:03:09,699
We're going to stop her.

474
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:17,165
Let's go.
We still have a lot to do.

475
01:03:17,332 --> 01:03:22,629
This school costs my father gold money.
- My parents are getting mad.

476
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,383
Forget it.

477
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:38,103
I can see you tomorrow
use your computer?

478
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,480
Of course. For what?

479
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,150
Nothing special.

480
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:04,671
What's wrong with you?

481
01:04:04,838 --> 01:04:08,675
How do you mean?
- You are not yourself.

482
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:12,804
There is nothing.

483
01:04:19,352 --> 01:04:23,190
Would you like to help me?
-Of course.

484
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:27,777
What are your plans?

485
01:04:28,862 --> 01:04:33,033
I want to go to Stanford.
Just like my dad.

486
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:38,538
You were crazy about him, right?

487
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,418
You are very mature.

488
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:46,004
You can almost fly out.

489
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:49,174
You just have to trust in God.

490
01:04:49,341 --> 01:04:52,052
I have a lot of trouble with that.

491
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:57,682
I understand that. I also suffered.
But you have to learn to forgive.

492
01:04:57,849 --> 01:05:03,647
You have to forgive your mother for them
you left. And your father too.

493
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:07,400
Then you have peace with it.

494
01:05:11,238 --> 01:05:13,406
Trust in the Lord.

495
01:05:35,303 --> 01:05:40,392
I've come to bring your food.
-Do you want to put it in?

496
01:06:15,093 --> 01:06:18,388
You have many crucifixes, say.

497
01:06:29,608 --> 01:06:32,110
Kelsey, come with us.

498
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:39,868
What's your name?
-Faith.

499
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:44,331
That means 'trust'.
Do you have that too?

500
01:06:44,497 --> 01:06:49,794
Whether I trust in God?
I'm trying my best.

501
01:06:50,837 --> 01:06:54,257
I didn't have it at your age.

502
01:06:55,592 --> 01:06:59,429
I wanted it
and I hoped so too.

503
01:06:59,596 --> 01:07:04,976
But it only happened
when I looked into Jesus' eyes.

504
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:08,313
So sad and so beautiful.

505
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,120
Who are those girls?

506
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:28,291
The Illuminatis.

507
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:32,337
Faith, come join us.

508
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:41,471
Erica, come with us.

509
01:07:47,102 --> 01:07:49,646
Gina, come with us.

510
01:07:52,232 --> 01:07:54,651
Nicole, come join us.

511
01:07:55,694 --> 01:08:00,991
The Lord is my light and my salvation.
Who would I fear?

512
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:05,161
When culprits approach me
to eat my meat ...

513
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:08,039
they will stumble themselves.

514
01:08:08,206 --> 01:08:10,542
We remain confident.

515
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,256
Do you believe?

516
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:10,268
Help me.

517
01:09:13,021 --> 01:09:17,067
The food is up.
De Wachter is dead.

518
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:20,737
The girls are ours.

519
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:36,086
It seems like a heart attack.

520
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:41,591
She was already walking
to struggle for a while.

521
01:09:44,928 --> 01:09:52,602
The boys from the lab have a sign
found on the corpse from the church.

522
01:09:55,021 --> 01:10:01,361
They had no idea what it was.
Do you want to view the photo once?

523
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:05,657
Of course.

524
01:10:09,244 --> 01:10:12,163
Come to us, o Long-awaited.

525
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:15,333
We call You, Master of Spirits.

526
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,640
You move forward with Latin.
- I did my homework.

527
01:10:30,807 --> 01:10:37,814
Blessed are the poor in spirit, right?
-Knowledge is power. I got that from you.

528
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:43,195
Welcome, come join our circle.
- Here you are among friends.

529
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:46,198
You are very popular here.

530
01:10:46,364 --> 01:10:52,120
What did you do with them?
- You look like a saint.

531
01:10:52,287 --> 01:10:55,749
You play with fire.
This is a serious matter.

532
01:10:55,916 --> 01:11:00,921
That has always been it, scared.
I'm not scared anymore.

533
01:11:01,087 --> 01:11:03,215
Then come to us.

534
01:11:04,841 --> 01:11:07,135
Then take a look.

535
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,598
Are you not afraid of your soul?

536
01:11:11,765 --> 01:11:13,725
Look here.

537
01:11:13,892 --> 01:11:19,105
You are not devil servants,
but ordinary girls.

538
01:11:22,776 --> 01:11:28,615
Go to bed, girl. And think about it
that you pray. Tomorrow is Good Friday.

539
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,038
We start again.

540
01:11:36,248 --> 01:11:37,832
Hurry up.

541
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:46,842
Long awaited ...

542
01:11:48,593 --> 01:11:51,429
we call you.

543
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:54,933
Let us know if we are worthy of you.

544
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:54,784
It does not work.

545
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:06,963
<i> The Book is missing its path </i>.

546
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:10,050
The Book illuminates its path.

547
01:13:48,088 --> 01:13:50,757
I just figured this out.

548
01:13:52,968 --> 01:13:57,222
What are you doing here?
-This is really insane.

549
01:14:05,647 --> 01:14:11,444
I know how it works, I think.
I have been thinking here all day.

550
01:14:29,629 --> 01:14:33,550
This is the way out.
After a long thought I realized.

551
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:43,268
Take the book.
-Come on, down here.

552
01:14:45,729 --> 01:14:49,858
The Illuminatis knew this way out
apparently not.

553
01:14:50,025 --> 01:14:53,320
How do you mean?
-During that fire.

554
01:14:56,114 --> 01:14:58,033
Where is it?

555
01:15:14,424 --> 01:15:15,884
Where is it?

556
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:31,691
We have to get the Book back.
We have to find Faith.

557
01:15:31,858 --> 01:15:34,903
I give up. What is it?

558
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,989
This is a diabolical book.

559
01:15:38,156 --> 01:15:43,370
A translation of a book about
black magic. And it really works.

560
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:49,042
Okay, you wanna get rid of it?
Just give.

561
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:01,763
So disappeared.

562
01:16:06,685 --> 01:16:12,148
You will not see that book again.
Fish don't do black magic.

563
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:15,986
It's dry.

564
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:42,721
I have thought about the power of God.

565
01:16:44,514 --> 01:16:46,766
And I have the answer.

566
01:16:46,933 --> 01:16:50,228
Jamie, what are you doing here?

567
01:16:50,395 --> 01:16:54,900
The power of God does not fall
at that of the long-awaited.

568
01:16:55,066 --> 01:16:57,819
Stop the blasphemy.

569
01:17:08,997 --> 01:17:12,417
You are not a devil's servant.

570
01:17:15,795 --> 01:17:18,590
Then I will serve you.

571
01:17:18,757 --> 01:17:22,427
I pray for your soul rest.

572
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:24,763
No need.

573
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:28,517
I would have liked to be with de Wachter
want to talk.

574
01:17:28,683 --> 01:17:34,397
But I want to know one more thing.
How are you planning to stop me?

575
01:17:34,564 --> 01:17:37,067
I'm sending you home.

576
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:44,991
Look into my eyes.

577
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:48,328
Tell me all your secrets.

578
01:18:20,485 --> 01:18:23,071
De Wachter is still alive.

579
01:18:39,963 --> 01:18:42,424
We're going to Father Michael.

580
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:55,562
Get out.

581
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:02,879
Alarm center.
Send the police to Santa Carlita.

582
01:20:03,046 --> 01:20:07,467
Calm down. I can not do anything
if I don't understand you.

583
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:11,304
My friend is in danger and I ...

584
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:14,933
Stay there. We send help.

585
01:20:16,685 --> 01:20:19,855
Wait ...
Thanks for calling.

586
01:21:34,262 --> 01:21:36,806
The book.
-Sorry.

587
01:21:36,973 --> 01:21:42,687
We need it for
the Mirror Conspiracy. Come on.

588
01:21:42,854 --> 01:21:45,690
The Book is ours.

589
01:21:59,913 --> 01:22:02,332
We need some stuff.

590
01:22:02,499 --> 01:22:04,918
First some salt.

591
01:22:05,085 --> 01:22:08,630
And we make it
the consecrated host.

592
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:11,341
First find Daniel.

593
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:15,136
Blessed be the soul
of your fairy tale prince.

594
01:22:15,303 --> 01:22:19,057
He will experience a lot,
just before his death.

595
01:22:19,224 --> 01:22:24,145
Can I have the Book?
-The Book is ours.

596
01:22:24,312 --> 01:22:29,401
You do not know what you are doing.
-The power of God is mine.

597
01:22:31,361 --> 01:22:35,949
The Book is lying.
The text was changed 1000 years ago.

598
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:39,411
How do you know that?

599
01:22:49,754 --> 01:22:51,798
Finally.

600
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,970
Nice dagger.

601
01:22:57,137 --> 01:23:03,435
Stop immediately. I want you
don't hurt. None of you.

602
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:12,903
The Apocalypse is approaching.
Woe to the earth and the sea.

603
01:23:13,069 --> 01:23:18,658
Because the devil is coming to get you.
He strikes quickly and relentlessly.

604
01:23:25,665 --> 01:23:30,003
With the Mirror Cladding
you don't provoke the Long-awaited.

605
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:34,633
Lucifer comes to steal your soul.
Just look in the mirror.

606
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:40,472
Then you can see for yourself.
-Sorry, I just don't believe you.

607
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:48,146
My order has been trying for a thousand years
to submit the devil to God.

608
01:23:48,313 --> 01:23:52,150
Jamie, come live in the light.

609
01:23:59,783 --> 01:24:01,743
I'm in charge of you.

610
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:10,627
Let me go.

611
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:25,976
De Wachter is dead.
Long live the long-awaited one.

612
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,856
What do we do with Faith?
-Let her.

613
01:24:31,022 --> 01:24:33,692
It's Good Friday.

614
01:24:48,498 --> 01:24:54,462
Behold the long-awaited one.
He who knows no equal.

615
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:59,467
Show us Your dark forces.
Let us see you.

616
01:25:27,412 --> 01:25:31,791
Ancient, enter again
the black earth.

617
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:36,213
Great pleasures await You.
The rule is yours.

618
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:05,617
Submit
to the power of the true God.

619
01:26:52,873 --> 01:26:56,293
I brought you back.

620
01:26:56,459 --> 01:26:58,837
I get the power.

621
01:27:30,285 --> 01:27:35,123
The police and the church claimed
that Jamie had gone mad.

622
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:41,838
That she had Sherilyn and Father Michael
killed and then committed suicide.

623
01:27:42,005 --> 01:27:47,010
They were silent about the devastation
to the font and the room.

624
01:27:47,177 --> 01:27:52,933
So maybe other girls have it
indeed called the devil.

625
01:27:55,685 --> 01:27:58,355
That was my confession, Reverend.
