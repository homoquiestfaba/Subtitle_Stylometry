1
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,766
Oh, God.

2
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,420
If this is your airport look,

3
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,857
I"d hate to see what you're
doing for the engagement party.

4
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,661
I don"t want him to forget
what he"s been missing.

5
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:29,818
Poorvi, some lip gloss.

6
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,080
No.

7
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,386
Partiv"s going to be there.

8
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,736
That"s nice. They let the
non-achieving branch

9
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:37,304
of the Kumar family tree
come along for the ride?

10
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,001
He"s not like the rest of them.

11
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:40,220
He is his own man.

12
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,612
Come on.

13
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,146
You look so beautiful.

14
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,148
I"m sure you'll knock
his socks off.

15
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,846
Come along, let"s go.

16
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,416
Mr. Panchouri,
you need to sign these.

17
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,026
Oh, no, Gopal, not now.

18
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,940
We"re getting late,

19
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,420
and we can"t afford that.

20
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,781
Glencoe. Sande Grande.
Arima. Toco.

21
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,305
No, thank you.

22
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,525
Your size good,
We ain"t 'fraid to small up.

23
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,309
We going off-route, dread.

24
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,442
All right, boss, next time?

25
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:29,573
Yes.

26
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:32,620
What did you say to that guy?

27
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:33,969
I told him

28
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:35,860
while we don"t mind
squeezing into his vehicle,

29
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,407
our stop"s off the beaten path,

30
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,732
which means he"d have
difficulty getting

31
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:39,844
a return fare.

32
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,238
He"ll be mayor
in a week, your brother.

33
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,849
You just have to do
your pre-travel research.

34
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,478
They"ve sent a limo.

35
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:17,578
You cannot stop here.

36
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,057
Well, if you did
your job, officer

37
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,320
and moved these cars along,

38
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,278
I wouldn"t need to
stay here, would I?

39
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,802
Listen, don"t get smart,
just move the jeep.

40
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,892
Right, I"m not afraid to give a
nice car ticket, you know.

41
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:30,155
Don"t worry, officer, be happy.

42
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,505
Papa, Papa, don"t stress.

43
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:32,548
I"ll go get them.

44
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,280
Wow.

45
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:11,153
I love that song.

46
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,285
How you know all them words?

47
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,810
Played it, like,
a million times.

48
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,420
Yeah, right.

49
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,552
Why"s that funny?

50
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,814
"Cause I wrote it.

51
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,164
You wrote "Gyal Wuk"?

52
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,644
Lee de Leon.

53
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,472
Mr. Gyal Wuk
at your service.

54
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:27,474
Anita Panchouri.
I love your music.

55
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,823
Where have you been?

56
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,912
I don"t really do music no more.

57
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,479
I took a break from that.

58
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,610
A break?

59
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,222
You make happy music.

60
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,181
The world needs that.

61
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,402
Believe me.

62
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,707
I gotta go.

63
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,492
It was nice meeting you.

64
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,942
This is not your car!

65
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,068
You"re cutting it fine
arriving on the day

66
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:22,137
of the party.

67
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,356
Well, I did bring
a peace offering

68
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,488
for staying away so long.

69
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,843
So...

70
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,976
Beautiful.

71
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,107
You"re forgiven.

72
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:39,981
Good, how are you?

73
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,373
Hi.

74
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:44,028
Papa, you look great.

75
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,469
Lokesh, my old friend.

76
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,996
Welcome to Trinidad and Tobago.

77
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,998
Such a pleasure to come back
and see you, eh?

78
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,435
And my humble home is yours.

79
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,959
Just a minute, I"ve had an idea.

80
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,633
Can I show you
what Papa"s been building?

81
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:04,396
I know you"re really tired.

82
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,225
Splendid idea.

83
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,226
Come along, it"s on the way.

84
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,270
Easy.

85
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,371
All right, partner,

86
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,068
who say I don"t come
through for you?

87
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,461
I got you the best one.

88
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,419
Concrete pourer number one.

89
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,595
Nice.

90
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,509
You"re starting tomorrow.

91
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:30,727
All right?

92
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,965
And a good thing
you ain"t playing no more

93
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,556
"cause a guy lost his finger

94
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,775
in an accident last week.

95
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,038
What?
Don"t worry.

96
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,387
Tell me about London.

97
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,649
London.
London.

98
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:06,981
Here we are.

99
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:10,898
This is the first
of 28 stand-alone structures

100
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:14,118
in my resort of 180 units.

101
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:17,557
Studios, one-bedrooms,
luxury suites,

102
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,211
a great gym, a pool.

103
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,473
Prime beachfront.

104
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,954
Seventy-four acres of land,

105
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,740
surrounded by sea
on all three sides.

106
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,351
Means the spa can have
fresh fruit and juices

107
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:31,179
from its very own orchard.

108
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:32,397
That, too.

109
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,008
How did you secure
all this then?

110
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,271
I went to the owners one by one,

111
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,273
and I cobbled it together.

112
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,275
Took him five years.

113
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,798
By the end of the year,

114
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,931
half these units will be open

115
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,281
and so will the Revive Spa.

116
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,500
Caribbean Airlines
is already asking

117
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:50,328
about their package deals
for London flights.

118
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,374
It"s the heaviest flight load.

119
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,418
Impressive.

120
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,159
Location specific.
Yeah.

121
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:57,118
It"s beautiful.

122
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,207
The photos don"t do it justice.

123
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,384
As always, Ram,
an eye for an opportunity.

124
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,996
Finally, it"s all coming
together.

125
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,084
Come, let"s go.

126
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:22,752
Hey, what"s her name?

127
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,455
Forget her.

128
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,805
Tell me about her.

129
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,721
Stop playing that, man,
tell me the names, stats.

130
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:37,419
Remember, I"m a married man,

131
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:38,942
so tell me everything.

132
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:42,380
Bud, it"s pictures I took,
not an inventory.

133
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,295
Man, you"ve been living
your life in London,

134
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,558
playing with all
the big pop stars.

135
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:49,823
Backup rhythm guitar
on a few acoustic covers.

136
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,520
Guesting on all the big tracks.

137
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,609
Cut from all the album versions.

138
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,133
You"re right, who needs it, uh?

139
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,005
You"re gonna love
construction anyway.

140
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,615
Yeah, but...

141
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,748
I been thinking.

142
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,967
Dread, it"s Carnival.

143
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,361
It would be crazy
not to take a shot.

144
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,102
Shot? Nah, nah, nah.

145
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,581
You said you were done.

146
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,628
You said to shoot you
if you sing another song.

147
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,935
Hey, de Leon, you reach back.

148
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,153
You done know.

149
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,851
Yes, man.
Big brother.

150
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,940
Yeah.

151
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,550
You know, he and Cynthia,
they are...

152
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:22,507
Break up.

153
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,901
And getting back together.

154
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,381
You leave spies?

155
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,122
It"s always the same news.

156
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,297
Hey, watch.

157
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:33,605
Invite me up.

158
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,234
And what"s your news?

159
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:59,240
Eh, Bud, your boy is back.

160
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,545
Who would take you back now?

161
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:01,609
You"ve been away for so long.

162
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,287
We could cut a few demos.

163
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,898
Demos cost money.

164
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,223
I ain"t hear talk
about money yet.

165
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,901
So book some gigs.

166
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,251
Yeah, but nobody
hires musicians anymore.

167
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:11,513
There"s only DJ work now.

168
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:15,125
I find this on the board.

169
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,213
This?

170
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,649
This has been all around town,

171
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,347
some guy looking for a set
of musicians.

172
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,393
Plus, must be skilled
in tabla and sitar.

173
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,221
Not a problem.

174
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,094
Since when you play sitar?

175
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,705
Brother, I play life.

176
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,141
Just book it.

177
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,621
All right, boss.

178
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,802
Namaste.

179
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,282
Proceed this way.

180
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:51,945
Sita, I haven"t seen you
since the ballet in Delhi.

181
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,120
Welcome, welcome.

182
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,599
Come and join the party.

183
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:58,212
Poru, you look fantastic.
So good to see you.

184
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,562
Welcome, welcome.
Always a pleasure.

185
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:01,955
Hey, Rakshan!

186
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,113
Hey.
Hey.

187
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:34,465
That"s an awfully small sitar.

188
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,946
I play sitar on the ukulele.

189
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,339
Yeah?

190
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,603
Yeah, I been doing this
for some time now in England.

191
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:42,647
Really?

192
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,825
Mmm-hmm, I just echo
what you play.

193
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,565
Yeah... echo.

194
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:58,620
Excuse me.

195
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,540
No.

196
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,195
I say we pack up and leave!

197
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,808
Oh, my gosh, you look gorgeous.

198
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,549
Just putting her
best foot forward.

199
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,290
When young Kumar
see her tonight,

200
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,466
for sure the hook going
all the way in.

201
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,207
He will set that date one time.

202
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,079
Haha! Looks like we don"t
need our passion fruit anymore.

203
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,603
We need you downstairs.

204
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,345
Oh, my God.

205
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,739
Sweeter, hotter.

206
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:31,847
Uncle is stressing
about the roti skins

207
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,567
or something.

208
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,655
Oh, really?

209
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:36,919
God, your father will drive
me crazy.

210
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,834
I am gonna have a
little pow-wow with Poorvi.

211
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,159
Child, you need to put
some clothes on.

212
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,010
Come along.

213
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,794
What? No, I have things
to do.

214
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:44,361
It"s an engagement party.

215
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:45,599
You have to dress
a little better.

216
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,799
It won"t take a minute.

217
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:49,105
I"ve got plans for you, Missy.

218
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,885
Oh, my God!
Anita you look amazing.

219
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,452
Jasmine, two minutes,
two minutes.

220
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,112
Papa, is everything okay?

221
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:26,768
Oh, yes... fine.
They"re just bluffing.

222
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,075
They want me to make
a higher offer.

223
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,338
But I won"t.
You know why?

224
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,861
Business 101.

225
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,995
They are here with all
their musicians, technicians,

226
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,736
in front of the cream
of Trinidad society.

227
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,174
They"re not just gonna
walk away, are they?

228
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,874
Papa, I think...

229
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:46,917
Go, go!

230
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,532
They will rue the day.

231
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:52,707
Don"t worry,

232
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,970
everything is gonna be okay.

233
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,928
I"ll play.

234
00:16:56,972 --> 00:17:00,454
Oh, uh, you a
professional musician?

235
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,804
Absolutely, sir.

236
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,198
And, uh, your band?

237
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,374
Me, and me alone.

238
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,811
You and your...

239
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,813
Ukulele.

240
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:15,860
Ukulele, right.

241
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:19,212
Sanjay, bring my CD
collection, please.

242
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,910
Papa, let him play.
He"s good.

243
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,129
How do you know?

244
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,391
I"ve heard him.

245
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:29,526
Come on, I"m not gonna
ruin the party.

246
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:35,837
Okay, I trust you, my darling.

247
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,927
Sanjay, show our musician friend

248
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,409
where he can set up
with his, uh, ukulele.

249
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:45,194
Come this way, sir.

250
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,761
Ah, Mr. Panchouri.

251
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:47,804
Oh, hey!

252
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:03,995
Hi.

253
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,909
Hi.

254
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,607
You"re um... Partiv.

255
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,043
The other brother.

256
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,785
Right and you are... The blogger.

257
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:13,048
Poorvi"s coming.
Say something nice.

258
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,571
What do I even say?

259
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,008
Tell her she looks beautiful.

260
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,928
Poorvi, you look...

261
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,365
Ridiculous, I know.

262
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:28,324
Anita painted me up
like drywall, hmm.

263
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,633
Okay. Landa.

264
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,074
I"m going to get a drink.

265
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,641
It"s a free bar.

266
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:43,948
Still playing matchmaker?

267
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,646
And failing miserably.

268
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,001
Congrats.

269
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,916
I never thought
you"d be my sister-in-law.

270
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,396
But you made the right choice.

271
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:58,789
I did.

272
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:06,796
Whoo!

273
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,195
Thank you.

274
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,419
At least the drinks
are priceless,

275
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:22,248
even if the jury"s out
on the entertainment.

276
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,382
Strange Ram sent
the musicians home.

277
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,689
Is there some sort
of local strike?

278
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:31,213
I"d like to strike them
with my fist.

279
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,607
He"s Ram Panchouri.

280
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,435
He"s the reason half
of them have houses.

281
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:36,610
Yes, of course.

282
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,483
I"m Jasmine.

283
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:41,963
Nikhil Kumar.

284
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,270
You"re the other brother.

285
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,313
Indeed.

286
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,012
It was nice meeting you.

287
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,756
Oh, my God, this is ridiculous.

288
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,497
Who gets married in a palace?

289
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,108
A princess.

290
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,982
When all this is over

291
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,853
and we"re back in London,

292
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:05,073
it"ll be breakfast in bed,

293
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,727
morning jogs,

294
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,729
and evening strolls.

295
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,034
Just the two of us.

296
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,078
Yeah?

297
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,996
You"ve got to dump India Steel.

298
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,650
I don"t care what
they"re telling you.

299
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,671
They"re in a slide and
their internals aren"t good.

300
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,089
However, there is
an engineering firm

301
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:24,484
out of Bangalore we"ll want
to take a look at.

302
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,965
Did you notice he let go
the first set of musicians?

303
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,403
It"s odd to be changing plans
mid-stream, don"t you think?

304
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,187
Ram can be eccentric.

305
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,537
Chaotic more like it.

306
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:35,451
It"s taken them three hours

307
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,323
to set up one buffet table.

308
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,064
They just want to make
the best impression.

309
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:43,590
Nikhil, they"re doing
a great job hosting this.

310
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,506
Let"s not spoil it.

311
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,377
Do you think we should
take our seats?

312
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,858
I"m just gonna have a little
bit of a stroll around.

313
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:51,989
I"ll see you then.

314
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:59,301
Poorvi, I think you should
sit next to Partiv.

315
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,912
Anita, stop.

316
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,523
Partiv is, like, a very sweet,

317
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,089
very lost big brother.

318
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,676
I live in the real world,
and in the real world,

319
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,920
he gets motion sickness
from a tire swing.

320
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,246
Let"s face it,
he"d be the first one

321
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,358
voted off the island.

322
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,315
Let"s go.

323
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,186
He wouldn"t.

324
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,587
I hope he doesn"t sing
about weed.

325
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:26,589
I hope he does sing about weed.

326
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,243
And share some, too.

327
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,287
Ooh.

328
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,251
That one guy is doing
all the music?

329
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,470
He better be good.

330
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,210
Dad"s a stickler for music

331
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:40,492
now that he"s a season sponsor

332
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,909
of the Bristol Philharmonic.

333
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:44,520
Where"s Nikhil?

334
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,174
Friends...

335
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:47,915
may I have your attention,
please?

336
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,701
This celebration tonight
is to welcome the Kumars

337
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:55,966
from London with our famous
Trinidadian hospitality.

338
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,885
And, and with these words
of wisdom:

339
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,367
Nobody teaches the volcano
how to erupt.

340
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:08,283
Nobody teaches the tsunami
how to sweep everything

341
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,545
before it.

342
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:13,027
No one teaches the hurricane
how to wreak havoc.

343
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,595
No one teaches a man
how to find a wife.

344
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:20,251
Nobody teaches a woman
how to find love.

345
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,689
Natural disasters just happen.

346
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,561
Let the music begin.

347
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:25,881
Here we go!

348
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:29,669
Well, this one is about
uniting the nation!

349
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:31,845
Why can"t we all get along?

350
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,802
You have to work,

351
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,891
even while the big party"s
going on.

352
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:47,937
There were a few pressing
emails I needed to attend to.

353
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,812
Vertical gardens.

354
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:55,336
Tea lounges, steam rooms.

355
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:58,992
The largest hamam
in the entire Caribbean.

356
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:03,300
Oh, Mr. Panchouri has thought
of everything.

357
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:06,260
It"s amazing that Ram
is able to manage

358
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,262
his cashflow during
the construction phase,

359
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:09,916
before the revenue starts
coming in.

360
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,961
There will be advances in place.

361
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,136
Yes, of course.

362
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,790
Anita mentioned that.

363
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:18,620
Mr. Panchouri is
a visionary.

364
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,622
Very wise man.

365
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:24,931
Well, do come join us.

366
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,454
Of course I will.
See you in a bit.

367
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:27,497
Enjoy.

368
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,277
That was great!

369
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,548
Come here, you.

370
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:20,029
Fantastic show, uh?
Thank you.

371
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,075
Not too bad yourself.
Oh, you"re teasing.

372
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:27,428
You were amazing.

373
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:28,647
Good, right?

374
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,300
I don"t know how much
encouragement

375
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,824
I wanna give a stalker.

376
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,609
Stalker? You"re the one
singing all my songs

377
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,741
all the time.

378
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,264
How did you find me?

379
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,701
Fate and a flyer.

380
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:42,138
I was singing the song
in my room.

381
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,270
How did you know?

382
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:45,838
Listen, I just followed
your lead.

383
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,317
Followed my lead?
What?

384
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:49,755
Anyway, why"s your dad
having this big party?

385
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:52,061
Oh, my God.

386
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:54,934
Hello, we need to talk
about your man, okay?

387
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:57,458
So, I was finally able to pry
him away from the aunties.

388
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,068
And I am sorry,

389
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,112
he is amazing.

390
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,768
I"m so jealous of you.

391
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,508
You have the perfect
engagement party,

392
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,510
perfect husband, perfect ring.

393
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:09,644
I"ll tell you all about it.

394
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:23,092
Lee, you were fantastic.
Thank you.

395
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,051
You must meet my friend, Vijay.

396
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:28,271
He"s been organizing some
fantastic concerts here lately.

397
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,405
Lee, I remember you,
another big hit.

398
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,059
Went to London, disappear.

399
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:34,234
Bud still managing you?

400
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:35,496
Still with Bud, man.

401
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,238
Have a drink,
catch up on old times.

402
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:12,030
Tell ya everything
would have been perfect.

403
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:13,360
Everybody talking about how

404
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:14,665
it"s the best engagement party

405
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:15,884
they ever went to.

406
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:18,060
They like the food,
they like the decorations.

407
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:20,280
And everybody saying
you look so nice.

408
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:21,368
Except Nadia.

409
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,717
I see her watching you.

410
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,695
You know, she want to look
like you for her wedding.

411
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,765
I"ll tell you a story
about her later.

412
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,072
And I didn"t know Mr. Lokesh
could dance like that.

413
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:33,467
Hey, I saw that my dad
hooked you up with Vijay.

414
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,685
Amazing.

415
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,600
I got a gig Sunday night.

416
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,733
He has the perfect venue.

417
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,256
You"re gonna be amazing.

418
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,738
Whatcha looking at?

419
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,654
That is my fiancee"s brother.

420
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:48,003
I"ve been trying to hook him up

421
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,745
with my cousin forever.

422
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,442
Just get them in a
romantic place.

423
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:53,400
Where?

424
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,054
Like a island.

425
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:56,707
We"re already on an island.

426
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:58,579
Like a desert island.

427
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,364
You know, shipwreck,
two of them alone.

428
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,062
How am I supposed to do that?

429
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:05,891
Get them to Pigeon Point.

430
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,433
I can"t get these people
to the cinema.

431
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,764
How am I supposed
to get them to Pigeon Point?

432
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,027
Listen, I have a cousin
named Soul Boy

433
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,334
who rents boats in Pigeon Point.

434
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,336
Okay, but what if I can"t get
the two of them

435
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:18,033
both out there together?

436
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:19,948
You got me back into music.

437
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,777
This is way easier than that.

438
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:37,836
Congrats, by the way.

439
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,359
I didn"t know you's
getting married.

440
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:40,402
I am.

441
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,451
You make a great couple.

442
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:46,583
So, friends?

443
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:49,411
Friendship.

444
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,551
Thank you.

445
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,471
I"m turning in.
That was some party.

446
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,473
Your dad must"ve invested
a lot in it.

447
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,233
Papa doesn"t think
about money when it comes

448
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:09,868
to this kind of thing.

449
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,739
My dad doesn"t either.

450
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:14,916
That"s what you and I
have in common.

451
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,179
We have to protect our fathers.

452
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,662
Good night.

453
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:23,794
Good night.

454
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,608
So, what"s on the agenda
for tomorrow?

455
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,025
Let"s go paddleboarding.

456
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,853
You want to go paddleboarding?

457
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,942
I don"t care what we do.

458
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:43,423
As long as we"re together.

459
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:53,085
You make it hard
to respect the house rules.

460
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:54,782
But I don"t want
your father thinking

461
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:57,698
I take you for granted
because, well, you know.

462
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:01,093
I"m a good girl?
You"re a good woman.

463
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,706
I love you.
Good night.

464
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:06,794
Good night.

465
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:33,299
We had an amazing night
tonight, Ma.

466
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:37,303
And don"t worry,
I"m looking after Papa.

467
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:16,124
That"s fantastic.

468
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:17,517
Really, really great, yeah.

469
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,581
Yeah, so I"ll call you tomorrow.

470
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:21,303
Great, yeah, bless.

471
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:24,524
I just finished dealing
with that fella Vijay

472
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:25,525
I set you up with.

473
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,527
You set me up with?

474
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,659
Also got studio time for you.

475
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,879
So, when we finish eat,
we"re going over there.

476
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,011
Seen.
Seen.

477
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:35,970
Wait, wait.

478
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,058
Scratch that.

479
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,712
It"ll have to be another day.

480
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:40,018
What do you mean, Lee?

481
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,758
Carnival ain"t waiting
for you, you know.

482
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,258
It"s either you're in
or you"re out.

483
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,458
Yeah, but I promised
somebody I"d do something.

484
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:46,589
Well, un-promise it.

485
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:47,982
I can"t.

486
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,462
It"s a woman promise.

487
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:52,943
She"s a friend, and I owe her.

488
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,858
Look, let me just
do this one thing

489
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,425
for her and we"ll be even.

490
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,558
Be even?
Lee?

491
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,081
Lee!

492
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,909
You didn"t even
finish your food.

493
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,174
Okay, I"m off.

494
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,369
Don"t forget to update
the pictures

495
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:08,568
to the website.

496
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:10,328
I"ll do it as soon
as I finish this package

497
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,050
for young Mr. Kumar.

498
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,313
Nikhil?

499
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,357
Uh, yes.

500
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:16,532
We had a chat last night.

501
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,969
He seems very interested
in the spa resort.

502
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:21,059
I"d prefer if you don't
talk to him about that.

503
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,451
But he"s our guest.

504
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,366
I know, but I think he
might be involved

505
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,977
with other developers
and digging for information.

506
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,546
I don"t want anyone stealing
Papa"s great ideas.

507
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,374
Of course, but do you
really think...

508
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,506
Gopal, please.

509
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,029
No more private meetings.

510
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,336
We need to keep everything
on track.

511
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Okay.

512
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,920
Come on, we"re gonna miss
the boat.

513
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:58,792
Which one you prefer?
This one or this one?

514
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,185
You already have a bag.

515
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,796
Come on, we"re gonna
miss the boat.

516
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,363
Look at the sea of boats.

517
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,625
Gorgeous islands.

518
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,756
Yes.

519
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
We can paddle
all the way out there.

520
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:12,980
All right.

521
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,634
This is how we"re doing this.

522
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,810
You and you.

523
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,032
You and you.

524
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,514
And you and you.

525
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,777
Uh, I"d really prefer not
to be paired with someone.

526
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,562
Hear now, partner.

527
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:32,304
Science does not care
what you prefer.

528
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:35,307
Science is a calculation
of weight and distribution.

529
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:39,093
Would you like
to drown today, brother?

530
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,443
No, sir.

531
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:42,487
Thought not.

532
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,751
That leaves you and me.

533
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,666
All right, everybody,
let"s head out.

534
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:52,933
I have no idea, either.

535
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:00,090
I don"t know.
Which side do you want?

536
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:01,942
Oh, no, no, no, not this boat.

537
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:03,683
That boat, all right?

538
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:04,945
But they look the same.

539
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:09,096
He"s still doing
the fashion retailing,

540
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:11,968
but he"s just got into
bed sheets and high-quality...

541
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,579
I don"t wanna bore you folks.

542
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:16,669
Nonsense, we need to know
about each other"s work.

543
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:19,672
It might be a good
partnership with the spa.

544
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,196
Oh, I"m sure there's
all kinds of, you know,

545
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,373
synergies between
our businesses.

546
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,157
Now, if only Partiv
could get started

547
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:28,420
on something.

548
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:32,206
By the way,
where is Partiv anyway?

549
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,426
Well, I have a feeling
that they"re gonna be back

550
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,428
any minute now.

551
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,081
Now, this one
on the other hand...

552
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,693
Tell Ram how in a single visit

553
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,216
to Gujarat last March,

554
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,653
you were able to get all
the textile plants together

555
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:48,353
in one go and double the output
of his London product, eh.

556
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,852
Actually came from
something Anita said.

557
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,443
Really?

558
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:53,096
I"m just gonna go
for a walk, okay?

559
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,141
You okay?

560
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,205
Yeah, I"m fine.
I can join you.

561
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,013
I"ll just be a minute.
Okay.

562
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:14,248
Hey.
Hey.

563
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,686
So, how"s the plan going?

564
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,645
Come see for yourself.

565
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:47,847
Amazing.

566
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,588
Yeah? Let me see.

567
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,637
Let me see, let me see.

568
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,339
Oh, my God, now they"re not
even talking to each other.

569
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,341
What?

570
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,057
I didn"t know you were gonna
sink their boat.

571
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,387
Don"t panic.

572
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:08,911
It"s up to us to add
the magic ingredients,

573
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:10,260
stir in a little love.

574
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:12,611
How are supposed to do that?

575
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,874
We improvise.

576
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,397
Look.

577
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,102
That"s sophisticated.

578
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,712
There you are.

579
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:39,429
You didn"t happen to see
Poorvi or Partiv anywhere,

580
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:40,672
did you?

581
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,848
Everyone"s starting
to get worried.

582
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,415
You okay?

583
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:46,199
Yeah.

584
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:47,243
Should we head back?

585
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:48,287
Mmm-hmmm.

586
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:58,472
What"s up?

587
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,256
Here you are, my man.

588
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:04,739
Look, a boat can"t
just disappear.

589
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:06,045
Okay.

590
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:08,047
Really starting to think
they killed each other.

591
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,483
I"m getting quite worried.

592
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,616
I think we should look for them.

593
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:14,357
Look at that.

594
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:19,319
Oh, my God.

595
00:42:19,362 --> 00:42:21,713
I think I"ve had
too much to drink.

596
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:26,761
Or maybe, it"s just an
old fashioned sunstroke.

597
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,937
You little schemer.

598
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,286
You set this up.

599
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:33,855
Have another card?

600
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,267
You are a goddess
of love, you know that?

601
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,511
Uh... must be a mistake.

602
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,730
Run it again.

603
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,514
Declined.
Ran it twice.

604
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,604
Um...

605
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:46,302
Here, take this one.

606
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:48,174
Lokesh, I can"t let you.
You"re my guest.

607
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:51,133
Hey, Ram, we"re family now.
It"s okay.

608
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:53,483
- But...
- It"s okay.

609
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,276
You"ve been checking
your phone all evening.

610
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:05,365
Any update on India Steel?

611
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:08,934
Dad, you respect my advice.

612
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:10,196
Sure.

613
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,720
You"re better than
my best financial guys.

614
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:14,287
Then listen to me.

615
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,594
This is the beginning
of them living off

616
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:18,030
what we"ve built.

617
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:20,467
Nikhil, his card
didn"t go through,

618
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,860
these things happen.

619
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:23,862
It"s a bad investment.

620
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:26,604
They"re a bad investment.

621
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,954
Look, you"re not gonna get
very far in life

622
00:43:28,997 --> 00:43:31,086
only seeing the worst in people.

623
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,044
Okay?

624
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:33,915
My old friend is fine.

625
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,508
Lee, about what happened...

626
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:03,162
It"s okay.

627
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:04,250
No, it"s just...

628
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,995
The music, I get carried away.

629
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:14,173
That song you heard me
singing last night,

630
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:15,740
my mom used to sing that.

631
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,132
Your mom?

632
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:19,308
She died when I was six.

633
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:20,701
Sorry.

634
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:23,138
But I know what
that could feel like.

635
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:26,838
My dad left us and
I couldn"t deal with it.

636
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:29,014
Then I found music.

637
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:32,539
Yeah, you can get lost in music.

638
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:33,671
Yeah.

639
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:34,865
The whole world
is black and white,

640
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,804
and then, boom!

641
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,023
You"re singing out loud.

642
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,807
And everything"s in color.

643
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:40,982
Yeah.

644
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:42,897
It makes me feel...

645
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:44,464
Bazodee.

646
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:46,640
Like you wake up
and you have no idea

647
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,207
where you are.

648
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,488
That"s how I felt
when I heard you

649
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:52,341
singing upstairs in that room.

650
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:54,126
But it"s not real.

651
00:44:56,998 --> 00:44:59,435
Yeah. Exactly.

652
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,264
I"m sorry.

653
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:03,613
It was wrong.

654
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:06,573
Don"t worry, gone.

655
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:09,881
Forgotten, "kay?

656
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,126
You are never gonna believe it.

657
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,085
From Rambagh Palace.

658
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:41,608
They"ve had a cancellation.

659
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:42,957
Our full fee"s already in.

660
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:45,046
We can have the entire palace.

661
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,613
In three weeks?

662
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:47,657
I can be there.

663
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,137
Let"s do it.

664
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:51,574
Guys, this isn"t up to you.

665
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:55,274
It"s up to her.

666
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:58,973
Anita, everyone who needs
to be there will be there.

667
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:01,584
It can be just like
we always dreamed.

668
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:02,760
What do you say?

669
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,330
Yes.

670
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:11,725
Dads, we"re getting married.

671
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,509
Fantastic!

672
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:16,556
Let"s book our tickets
to magical Jaipur.

673
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,341
Come along.

674
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:22,649
Papa, we don"t have
the money for this.

675
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:25,521
We can always borrow
against the house.

676
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:27,175
It"ll be all right.

677
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:31,571
Let"s go!

678
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:59,164
It looks gorgeous on you.

679
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,396
Look as though
you"re getting ready

680
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,571
for a funeral.

681
00:47:15,615 --> 00:47:17,399
Feel like I"m going
to a funeral.

682
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:19,184
You don"t write like it.

683
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:21,012
This is the one
you been working on, right?

684
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:22,404
You"re performing this tonight?

685
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:25,843
You have three verses
of new music

686
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,046
that you don"t want to sing?

687
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:31,500
Lee, whoever this woman is,

688
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:34,155
she"s your muse, dread.

689
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,896
She"s inspired you
to be amazing.

690
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,420
You don"t just shut
the door on that.

691
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:42,642
I"m looking for Lee.

692
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:46,124
Oh, there you are, hey.

693
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,429
Looking sharp.

694
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:48,474
Thank you.

695
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:49,867
How you feeling?

696
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,303
Really good.

697
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:52,346
Vijay.

698
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,177
Hi. Nikhil.

699
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:57,135
Vijay.

700
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:58,571
This is a very
impressive set-up.

701
00:47:58,614 --> 00:47:59,809
I"d love to learn more about it.

702
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:00,486
Sure, anytime.

703
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:01,966
Ram has my number.

704
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:03,421
Let"s meet up, have some
drinks, talk about it.

705
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:04,359
Excellent.

706
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:05,186
Big crowd out there.

707
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,884
Big expectations.

708
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,102
You"re gonna rock it.

709
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:10,235
Gonna soak them with some soca.

710
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:11,540
I"m sure you will.

711
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:13,020
- Don"t let me down.
- Enjoy.

712
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:13,847
Hey, Vijay.

713
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,717
How you doing?

714
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:15,805
Thanks, thanks, man.

715
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:17,677
Ram, see, took your advice.

716
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:19,940
Show time!
Show time!

717
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,811
Come on, come on!
Let"s go!

718
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,639
Vijay, Lee, time to leave.

719
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,815
Let"s go.
Get up, get up, get up!

720
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,121
Let"s go, show time!

721
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:28,165
Thank you.

722
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:34,346
Hey, remember what you
said at the airport?

723
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:36,348
What?

724
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:39,351
You told me my music
make people happy.

725
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:41,831
Well, tonight, I"m gonna do it.

726
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:44,269
I"m gonna make everybody happy.

727
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,317
800,000 women on this island

728
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:51,102
and you had to choose the one

729
00:48:51,145 --> 00:48:52,886
with the biggest rock
on her finger.

730
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,824
Introducing to you,
the man to shut it down,

731
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:22,829
the one, the only, Lee de Leon!

732
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:25,310
Ay, you!

733
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,353
Come here!

734
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,083
Congrats, man.

735
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:42,838
Lee was amazing.

736
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:44,492
We have to go
and congratulate him.

737
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:46,146
No, not now.

738
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,279
He"s going to be
surrounded by fans.

739
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,932
Let"s go sit at the bar.

740
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:52,109
Lokesh, come.

741
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:53,284
We have to go.

742
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:57,331
I just knew it!
Knew it!

743
00:51:57,375 --> 00:52:00,204
He definitely didn"t
let us down.

744
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:02,293
Excuse me.
Sorry, guys.

745
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:21,866
Anita!

746
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:25,958
Meet me tonight.

747
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,176
This is madness.

748
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,222
This is Carnival.

749
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,266
Go.

750
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:33,181
Go.

751
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:40,886
Come on, Anita.

752
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:43,410
You can get lost
in a place like this.

753
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:44,890
You need to do a better job

754
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:46,021
looking after your bride.

755
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:47,066
I will.

756
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:49,198
I"ll never let you go again.

757
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:50,242
Come on.

758
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:54,856
Hi, Lee.

759
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,336
Totally lovely show.

760
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,772
It was so good.

761
00:54:57,816 --> 00:54:58,947
You were amazing.

762
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,471
May I have your autograph?

763
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:20,055
What does it say?

764
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:49,911
Sorry, Miss Anita,
didn"t mean to wake you.

765
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:51,522
Take me with you.

766
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:52,784
What?
Take me with you.

767
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,960
Your father would kill me.

768
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:56,918
It have all kind of rough men
and vagabonds out.

769
00:55:56,962 --> 00:55:58,442
This is my last chance.

770
00:55:58,485 --> 00:55:59,680
I hope this don"t have
anything to do

771
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:00,922
with that soca boy you know.

772
00:56:00,966 --> 00:56:02,315
Come on.

773
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,882
Show me how you party.

774
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:06,145
Tonight is about us.

775
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:43,617
Mr. Kumar.

776
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:45,402
You are needing some help, sir?

777
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:46,359
No.

778
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,580
Just getting a spot
of fresh air.

779
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:53,366
Well, um, I just have to deliver
my peppers here now, eh?

780
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:55,586
Of course.

781
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:58,240
Peppers wait for no man.

782
00:56:58,284 --> 00:56:59,764
That"s right.

783
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:13,081
Bharat, wake up!

784
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:26,127
Driver, you need to go faster.

785
00:59:26,171 --> 00:59:27,171
No worries, man.

786
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:32,177
Hey, Nikki, I appreciate
a midnight run

787
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,526
as much as the next guy,

788
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,181
but this is a ridiculous
waste of my time.

789
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:38,575
You"ll see.
She"s playing you.

790
00:59:43,754 --> 00:59:45,886
Stop worrying about the time.

791
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,760
I have to keep track.

792
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:52,284
You have nowhere else to be.

793
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:55,722
No Partiv and Poorvi to fix,

794
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,811
no daddy to please.

795
00:59:57,855 --> 01:00:00,205
You know everything about me,

796
01:00:00,248 --> 01:00:02,903
and I know nothing about you.

797
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,732
Well, stay and you can
ask me anything.

798
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:07,255
Okay.

799
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:09,431
Where"s your family?

800
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:14,306
You said I could
ask you anything.

801
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,049
I never knew my dad.

802
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:21,879
And my mom, she"s a nurse Miami.

803
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:24,708
I was raised by my granny
in deep south.

804
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:25,751
A country boy.

805
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:29,800
Granny teach us everything,

806
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:31,366
even to play the guitar.

807
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,978
She used to play for us
every Sunday in Sunday school.

808
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:37,285
You? Sunday school?

809
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:40,071
Haul your ass.
I was a choir boy.

810
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:44,510
How does a choir boy
wind up singing soca?

811
01:00:44,553 --> 01:00:47,295
She used to play
all her records every day

812
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:48,862
except Sunday.

813
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,734
Kitchener was her boy.

814
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:52,866
Every time he win a crown

815
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,346
she would run out in the street

816
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:57,349
and ring this bell she had.

817
01:00:57,392 --> 01:00:59,830
Like if she win the crown.

818
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:01,962
I wanna make people
feel like doing that.

819
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:04,051
I wanna write the songs
that make people feel

820
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:06,488
like doing that.

821
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:07,620
You"re doing it.

822
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:11,406
"Cause of you.

823
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,890
You"re obsessed with her.

824
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:28,302
What do you think
she"s stealing off

825
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:29,893
to do in the middle
of the night?

826
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:32,199
How do you know
she"s not at home?

827
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:34,245
Because she"s not
in her room. I checked.

828
01:03:34,288 --> 01:03:37,074
There are 14 rooms
in that house.

829
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:38,249
Trust me, okay?

830
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:41,513
She"s not out buying
a wedding sari.

831
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:43,167
Isn"t that Vijay?

832
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:54,265
Young Mr. Kumar,

833
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:56,615
I didn"t know you wanted
to come Carnival.

834
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:58,573
You should"ve told me
to wait for you.

835
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,189
I"m going home.

836
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:08,453
Wait.

837
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,205
It"s crazy, really.

838
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:22,859
I mean, can you believe it?

839
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:25,644
Me, dancing and drinking
at a soca fete.

840
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:27,124
I don"t do these things.

841
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,429
Oh, my God!

842
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:31,041
And Partiv is talking
about us moving in together.

843
01:04:32,129 --> 01:04:34,609
We can be together in London.

844
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:37,134
You and me in the city
of Shakespeare.

845
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,092
Will and Kate, Big Ben.

846
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:41,268
It"ll be amazing.

847
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,445
We could team up.

848
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,795
I could do custom remodeling,
you could sell.

849
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:49,233
We"re gonna be unstoppable.

850
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:50,887
Cup of tea, anyone?

851
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:06,337
Looking for something,
Mr. Nikhil?

852
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,165
Just hoping to find a stapler.

853
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:09,383
Have you got one?

854
01:05:09,427 --> 01:05:11,690
There is one on the desk
right in front of you.

855
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:12,733
Silly me.

856
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:15,563
Now you have got to leave.

857
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:17,783
I must insist.

858
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,654
Whatever competitor
you"re working for

859
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:21,308
will have to come up
with your own ideas.

860
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:25,138
Mr. Panchouri"s vision
is completely confidential.

861
01:05:25,182 --> 01:05:28,576
What on earth
are you talking about?

862
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,710
I suppose it"s that horrible
Club Caribe corporation.

863
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:33,755
They have wanted
that land forever

864
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:35,583
to build their God-awful
timeshares.

865
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:38,412
Club Caribe?

866
01:05:38,456 --> 01:05:40,284
So, I"ve guessed correctly?

867
01:05:40,327 --> 01:05:42,895
Correctly? No.

868
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:43,896
Perfectly.

869
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,290
Absolutely perfectly.

870
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:57,257
Tonight, Ariapita Avenue.
I"m taking you.

871
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,867
You have to tell him something.

872
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:01,044
He don"t even know you"re going.

873
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,784
There"s nothing to tell,
it"s over.

874
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:05,526
You can lie,
but your face can"t.

875
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,659
Go and tell him the truth.

876
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,661
The truth is that
I made a mistake,

877
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,141
and I need to fix it.

878
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,756
You don"t have to marry Bharat.

879
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,192
You want me to fail Papa?

880
01:06:19,236 --> 01:06:20,517
And have everyone
say he climbed higher

881
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:21,760
than he should have?

882
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:23,303
Don"t nobody care
about that kind of thing.

883
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:26,330
They say they don"t,
but they do.

884
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:28,134
When I"m Mrs. Kumar,
no one will ever say that

885
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:29,289
about him again.

886
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,769
But Lee"s out there thinking...

887
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:32,747
He will get drunk and
get back on the music truck.

888
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:33,685
No, he won"t.

889
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:34,860
He"ll come looking for you.

890
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:35,861
He can"t come here.

891
01:06:35,904 --> 01:06:37,210
He"ll come

892
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:39,054
and then you"ll have
to tell him to his face.

893
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,867
What if it never happened?

894
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:44,565
You can"t change that.
Yes, I can.

895
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:46,176
All he knows about what I feel

896
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,829
is what I tell him.

897
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,416
Miss Anita,
I don"t think you understand

898
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,745
what you"re doing.

899
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:51,853
You"re lying about love
and it"s your future

900
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:53,009
you"re talking about.

901
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:56,229
Lalima, don"t you
have any other work?

902
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,250
Dad.

903
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:18,295
What?

904
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:20,079
I want you to forget
everything I said

905
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,341
about Ram"s project.

906
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:23,213
Good, because apparently,

907
01:07:23,256 --> 01:07:24,364
he needs a little more
capitalization

908
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:25,998
to get to the finish line.

909
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,347
I think you should do a bit more

910
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:29,132
than capitalization here.

911
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:30,785
You said it was
a terrible investment.

912
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:33,136
The property itself is
the tangible asset.

913
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:35,486
The rest has some risk
associated with it,

914
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,140
which is why you need
to maintain power

915
01:07:37,183 --> 01:07:38,315
of execution.

916
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:40,447
Am I to be
the majority investor?

917
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:42,797
Trust me, Dad.

918
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:44,451
I"ll draw up the deal memo,

919
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:46,018
you hand it to Ram.

920
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,846
Everyone will be pleased

921
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:49,108
and protected.

922
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:51,328
Don"t make it one
of those one-sided,

923
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:53,417
take-no-prisoners agreements.

924
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,853
Why would I do that?

925
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:57,595
It"s just a simple deal memo
to define the parameters

926
01:07:57,638 --> 01:08:00,250
so that there are no
misunderstandings

927
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:01,599
down the road.

928
01:08:01,642 --> 01:08:04,123
We all trust each other.

929
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,298
We"re family now.

930
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:14,090
Hello?

931
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,094
Anita.

932
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:28,843
Anita.

933
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:30,845
I think about you all day.

934
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:32,978
Can"t wait to see you.

935
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:34,675
I can"t come.

936
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:36,677
What do you mean
you"re not coming?

937
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,288
It was a mistake.

938
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:41,117
Babe, stop doubting yourself.

939
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:45,599
In what world can you
and I ever be together?

940
01:08:50,343 --> 01:08:51,170
Anita.

941
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:52,606
There was a bet.

942
01:08:56,393 --> 01:08:57,393
A bet?

943
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,442
A bet

944
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:04,227
to hook up with a black man.

945
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,533
Stop making this up.

946
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,145
Anita!

947
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,060
I"m sorry.

948
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:14,627
Ani...

949
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:44,527
Brilliant.

950
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:47,661
Thank you, Vijay.

951
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:16,515
Yeah.

952
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:12,300
Has Anita seen this agreement?

953
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:13,867
The idea for the two families

954
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:16,479
to collaborate on this project

955
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:19,264
was actually hers.

956
01:13:19,307 --> 01:13:20,570
Of course.

957
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:21,658
In any case,

958
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:23,224
this is all a formality.

959
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:25,009
If one can"t trust family,

960
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:27,054
who can one trust?

961
01:13:32,669 --> 01:13:34,192
Here you go.

962
01:13:34,235 --> 01:13:35,235
Thank you.

963
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:56,867
Okay, here we are.

964
01:13:57,824 --> 01:13:59,260
Okay, Anita,

965
01:13:59,304 --> 01:14:01,437
so we had to travel halfway
across the country,

966
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,439
because everything"s shut
for Carnival,

967
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:05,179
but I went to the distributor,

968
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:06,659
and I managed to get you
a caseload

969
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:08,269
of that frangipani soap
you love so much

970
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:09,923
so we can take it home with us.

971
01:14:09,967 --> 01:14:11,838
Thank you.

972
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:15,494
Time to get ready
for a big, fat Indian Wedding.

973
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,585
Shall we go?

974
01:14:19,629 --> 01:14:21,761
One last piece of business.

975
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:25,417
Are we going to include
this photo on the invites?

976
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:32,119
Say this is a lie.

977
01:14:33,947 --> 01:14:35,775
This can"t be true.

978
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:37,821
You betrayed us?!

979
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:48,092
What is this?

980
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:50,442
At least we get a
great deal of out it

981
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,965
to ease the pain.

982
01:14:52,009 --> 01:14:54,838
Deal? What deal?

983
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:55,882
What deal?

984
01:14:58,145 --> 01:15:01,497
The land, the resort, the spa...

985
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,846
I"ve signed it all over to them.

986
01:15:04,412 --> 01:15:07,590
Now, because of some
stupid fling,

987
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:09,113
we"ve lost everything.

988
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:14,292
You signed over everything?

989
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:16,250
Everything.

990
01:15:16,294 --> 01:15:19,036
Even this house
and everything in it.

991
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:21,081
I"m finished

992
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,214
because of you.

993
01:15:26,783 --> 01:15:28,436
Shame on you.

994
01:15:34,486 --> 01:15:36,923
This... this is...

995
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:39,012
This is all... this is all wrong.

996
01:15:41,754 --> 01:15:43,321
It"s okay.

997
01:15:43,364 --> 01:15:44,365
Please.

998
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:46,454
It was just a lapse in judgment.

999
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,501
On my part.

1000
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,591
The ring.

1001
01:16:05,169 --> 01:16:07,214
I hope you"re happy

1002
01:16:07,258 --> 01:16:08,955
when he has you dirt poor,

1003
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:13,569
run to ruin in some
country shack.

1004
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:23,056
Let"s go, Nikhil.

1005
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,451
Um, phone, please.

1006
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:28,366
You"ve ruined everything.

1007
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:31,674
Technically, you did

1008
01:16:31,717 --> 01:16:34,328
by being a lying whore.

1009
01:16:34,372 --> 01:16:36,200
Do you know why
I never went out with you?

1010
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:42,336
Despite the begging,
pleading, weeping phone calls?

1011
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,511
That was nothing.

1012
01:16:43,555 --> 01:16:45,122
It was just a stupid
little crush.

1013
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:47,864
You have been stalking,

1014
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:52,216
creeping, digging around.

1015
01:16:52,259 --> 01:16:54,087
What for?

1016
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:55,785
Are you happy now?

1017
01:16:55,828 --> 01:16:58,309
Yes, actually.

1018
01:16:58,352 --> 01:17:00,267
That"s interesting

1019
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:01,505
"cause you're the only one
in your family

1020
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:03,053
who can"t build anything.

1021
01:17:03,793 --> 01:17:05,838
You earn points.

1022
01:17:05,882 --> 01:17:07,033
You pay people
to be your friends

1023
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:08,624
and they still hate you.

1024
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:11,757
Everyone around you
despises you.

1025
01:17:14,194 --> 01:17:15,805
Why is that, Nikhil?

1026
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,531
Excuse me.

1027
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:48,706
Excuse me.

1028
01:17:49,316 --> 01:17:51,101
Excuse me.

1029
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:53,103
Give me the strongest thing
you"ve got.

1030
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:56,497
Make it a double.

1031
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:04,592
It"ll work out.

1032
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:07,247
Somehow, they"ll work it out.

1033
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,554
You know your dad
always finds a way.

1034
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:17,693
Yeah, I guess not.

1035
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,479
But at least now you can go

1036
01:18:21,522 --> 01:18:23,873
after the person
you really love.

1037
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:26,832
That"s the important thing.

1038
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,270
Right?

1039
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:37,451
Yeah.

1040
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:38,714
That"s the important thing.

1041
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:52,205
Your phone?

1042
01:18:53,946 --> 01:18:54,991
Blend it.

1043
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:56,819
What?

1044
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:59,604
Put this phone in that blender

1045
01:18:59,647 --> 01:19:02,738
and make me a drink.
Please.

1046
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:07,046
Serious?

1047
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:03,842
Partner, you riding with me.

1048
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:38,070
I"m not waiting an extra day

1049
01:20:38,094 --> 01:20:39,051
because of him.

1050
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:40,487
We need to check in right now.

1051
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:42,707
Come on, we can"t leave him.

1052
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,274
It"s just not like him.

1053
01:20:44,317 --> 01:20:46,232
He"s never been late
for a flight in his life.

1054
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:58,897
Oh, my God.

1055
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:05,338
Well, he certainly knows
how to make up

1056
01:21:05,382 --> 01:21:06,862
for lost time.

1057
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,122
You can"t do this.

1058
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:19,690
This is honest black man work.

1059
01:23:19,733 --> 01:23:21,779
I only said that
because we needed to stop

1060
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:23,433
and I didn"t know
what else to say.

1061
01:23:23,476 --> 01:23:25,087
I didn"t mean it!

1062
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,653
So, what parts did you mean?

1063
01:23:26,697 --> 01:23:28,133
And what parts was bullshit?

1064
01:23:28,177 --> 01:23:29,526
Nothing was bullshit.

1065
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:31,310
You can"t stop your music.

1066
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:32,833
Oh, so you want me to smile

1067
01:23:32,877 --> 01:23:34,270
with white bright teeth?

1068
01:23:34,313 --> 01:23:37,055
And play happy steel drum
for your rich friends?

1069
01:23:37,099 --> 01:23:39,840
I want the opposite
and you know that.

1070
01:23:39,884 --> 01:23:42,234
And what Anita wants,
Anita gets, right?

1071
01:23:42,278 --> 01:23:43,192
What I want?

1072
01:23:43,235 --> 01:23:44,343
I only wanted to help my father

1073
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:46,630
and ended up making him
lose everything.

1074
01:23:46,673 --> 01:23:48,893
His house, his dreams his money,

1075
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:50,721
it"s all gone.
That"s what I got.

1076
01:23:50,764 --> 01:23:53,028
You got nothing?

1077
01:23:55,682 --> 01:23:58,033
Well, at least one thing
turned out right.

1078
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:08,173
Mmm-hmmm.

1079
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:09,218
Amazon?
Yes.

1080
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:11,263
Venues by licensed people?

1081
01:24:13,657 --> 01:24:16,573
Fancy lights he wanted.

1082
01:24:16,616 --> 01:24:17,748
Hi.

1083
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:20,098
Hi.
Hi.

1084
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:21,882
Just give me one minute.

1085
01:24:21,926 --> 01:24:23,754
Hey, look, last time
you walked in,

1086
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:25,495
I lost my job.

1087
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:26,887
I lost my artist.

1088
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:27,931
I lost my friend.

1089
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:29,934
What happened?

1090
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:31,414
Why isn"t he performing?

1091
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:33,024
You"re asking me

1092
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,852
why he"s not performing?

1093
01:24:34,895 --> 01:24:36,288
I mean, you...

1094
01:24:38,595 --> 01:24:39,595
Hold on.

1095
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:42,251
Yeah, Mark.

1096
01:24:42,294 --> 01:24:44,035
Yes, of course, we still
want the lights.

1097
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,602
Just not the ones that
break down

1098
01:24:45,645 --> 01:24:46,907
after the first set.

1099
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:49,171
Yeah, LED lights.

1100
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,781
Moving heads.

1101
01:24:50,824 --> 01:24:53,436
Yeah, all right, okay, thanks.

1102
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:54,350
LED.

1103
01:24:54,393 --> 01:24:55,351
Expensive ones.

1104
01:24:55,394 --> 01:24:56,221
Expensive ones.

1105
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:57,179
And up the budget.

1106
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:58,571
Higher up the budget.
Higher.

1107
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:00,312
Higher... no, wait.

1108
01:25:00,356 --> 01:25:03,272
You know, the ones with
the turning heads.

1109
01:25:03,315 --> 01:25:04,708
But the moving hea...

1110
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:06,362
Stop touching things.

1111
01:25:06,405 --> 01:25:08,103
I don"t want your bad juju.

1112
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,713
Not you, Mark.

1113
01:25:09,756 --> 01:25:11,280
Okay.

1114
01:25:11,323 --> 01:25:12,324
Great, thanks.

1115
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:15,588
We have to get him back
in the game.

1116
01:25:15,632 --> 01:25:17,024
We don"t.

1117
01:25:17,068 --> 01:25:18,678
We have a show to do.

1118
01:25:18,722 --> 01:25:21,072
You can take your
bad lucky self and

1119
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,509
go home.

1120
01:25:23,553 --> 01:25:25,685
Look, we"re very busy here.

1121
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:27,078
Please.

1122
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:31,822
The lights?

1123
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:32,865
Budget.

1124
01:25:34,868 --> 01:25:36,566
What about his grandmother?

1125
01:25:36,609 --> 01:25:37,609
He"d listen to her.

1126
01:25:40,396 --> 01:25:43,834
He would...
if she were alive.

1127
01:25:46,358 --> 01:25:49,883
Look, Lee, the body dead.

1128
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:52,364
And there"s no one
that can change that.

1129
01:25:52,408 --> 01:25:53,408
Not even me.

1130
01:25:58,022 --> 01:25:59,066
Okay, thanks.

1131
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:03,114
Hmmm, that was sudden.

1132
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,551
Lee grandmother dying.

1133
01:26:05,595 --> 01:26:07,771
Share my condolences.

1134
01:26:38,062 --> 01:26:39,629
I have two words for you.

1135
01:26:39,672 --> 01:26:42,632
"Night out."

1136
01:26:42,675 --> 01:26:45,330
Jas, that is not
my thing anymore.

1137
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:47,071
Come on, it"s been four months.

1138
01:26:47,114 --> 01:26:50,030
Maybe when Poorvi
gets back for Carnival.

1139
01:26:50,074 --> 01:26:51,684
You haven"t even looked
at the invite.

1140
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:02,173
You"ve got to be kidding.

1141
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:05,655
You"re inviting me to the
Club Caribe groundbreaking?

1142
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:08,353
They hired me to do their PR.

1143
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:09,528
And I need help.

1144
01:27:09,572 --> 01:27:11,400
And you"re the person
that I want.

1145
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:14,881
Well, I"m not working
for the corporate demons

1146
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:16,970
the Kumars sold us out to.

1147
01:27:17,014 --> 01:27:18,189
Well, forget them.

1148
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,973
Come to get back in the game.

1149
01:27:20,017 --> 01:27:22,715
Meet people.

1150
01:27:22,759 --> 01:27:24,824
Stop wasting all your incredible
conversational skills

1151
01:27:24,848 --> 01:27:26,241
on plants.

1152
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:33,030
You know,

1153
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:35,162
you should go.

1154
01:27:35,206 --> 01:27:36,860
Otherwise, they"ll think
they"ve won.

1155
01:27:36,903 --> 01:27:38,557
They did win.

1156
01:27:38,601 --> 01:27:40,646
Really?

1157
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:43,910
What do you really miss?

1158
01:27:43,954 --> 01:27:46,652
The gardens? The servants?

1159
01:27:46,696 --> 01:27:49,481
Two big dining tables?

1160
01:27:49,525 --> 01:27:52,615
Hmmm? What?

1161
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:56,358
I know, you miss... the boy.

1162
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:03,103
I did this awful thing, Papa,

1163
01:28:03,147 --> 01:28:04,147
and...

1164
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,499
it can never be undone.

1165
01:28:07,543 --> 01:28:10,633
Nothing can be undone
making sandwiches for your papa.

1166
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:23,923
It doesn"t really matter
who"s gonna be there.

1167
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:25,055
What do you have to lose?

1168
01:29:26,099 --> 01:29:27,318
You, too?

1169
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,234
You guys need to stop.

1170
01:29:30,277 --> 01:29:32,236
What, you"re gonna sit
and suffer?

1171
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:33,846
I deserve it.

1172
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,153
For putting your father first?

1173
01:29:36,196 --> 01:29:38,068
For putting me and Partiv first?

1174
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:39,199
Making us happier

1175
01:29:39,243 --> 01:29:42,028
than we ever thought
we could be?

1176
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:44,422
What about Bharat?

1177
01:29:44,466 --> 01:29:46,772
Bharat got caught up in a storm.

1178
01:29:46,816 --> 01:29:47,947
It happens.

1179
01:29:47,991 --> 01:29:49,993
I see him, he"s okay.

1180
01:29:51,603 --> 01:29:53,213
Are you?

1181
01:29:53,257 --> 01:29:55,607
After ruining two generations
of friendship?

1182
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:59,916
Anita, still worrying
about everyone else, eh?

1183
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,048
Look,

1184
01:30:02,092 --> 01:30:05,225
I"m in London, job of my life,

1185
01:30:05,269 --> 01:30:06,488
man who loves me,

1186
01:30:06,531 --> 01:30:08,751
and sometimes I feel
like it"s a dream.

1187
01:30:08,794 --> 01:30:13,146
But it didn"t just happen.
You made that happen.

1188
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:15,279
You did it.

1189
01:30:15,322 --> 01:30:16,933
Now go and do something
for yourself now.

1190
01:30:18,978 --> 01:30:20,763
It"s not that simple.

1191
01:30:22,286 --> 01:30:24,027
Just think about it, okay?

1192
01:30:44,656 --> 01:30:45,656
Hey.

1193
01:30:46,832 --> 01:30:49,052
Got your "message."

1194
01:30:49,095 --> 01:30:50,706
Couldn"t argue with that.

1195
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,447
Hello.

1196
01:30:54,927 --> 01:30:57,930
Listen, that was
pretty sneaky of you.

1197
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:01,020
It"s called "determined."

1198
01:31:02,108 --> 01:31:03,501
Okay, then.

1199
01:31:03,545 --> 01:31:06,156
Well, for the second time,

1200
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:09,202
thanks for getting me
back into music.

1201
01:31:09,246 --> 01:31:11,161
I just wanted to say that.

1202
01:31:11,204 --> 01:31:14,294
I would do it a
thousand times if I had to.

1203
01:31:14,338 --> 01:31:16,253
I"ll always do it.

1204
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:18,298
I believe in you.

1205
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,692
Listen, I just...

1206
01:31:20,736 --> 01:31:21,911
Don"t.

1207
01:31:21,954 --> 01:31:23,913
Don"t say anything.

1208
01:31:23,956 --> 01:31:28,526
Yeah, I was never that good
with words anyway.

1209
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:30,789
If I wanna say something
I"ll say it...

1210
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,487
With a song.

1211
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:34,880
Exactly.

1212
01:31:36,142 --> 01:31:37,274
Okay.

1213
01:32:15,225 --> 01:32:16,618
Anita.

1214
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:17,661
Anita.

1215
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:21,971
What are you doing here?

1216
01:32:22,014 --> 01:32:23,799
I came to a groundbreaking.

1217
01:32:23,842 --> 01:32:25,801
Nikhil, I feel bad enough.

1218
01:32:25,844 --> 01:32:27,498
I don"t need this humiliation.

1219
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,455
Anita, wait.

1220
01:32:28,499 --> 01:32:29,848
Just, Bharat...

1221
01:32:29,892 --> 01:32:33,025
Just listen to me
for Bharat"s sake.

1222
01:32:33,069 --> 01:32:34,810
You said things
to me that no one

1223
01:32:34,853 --> 01:32:36,159
has ever said.

1224
01:32:36,202 --> 01:32:37,769
You asked me if I was happy.

1225
01:32:37,813 --> 01:32:40,293
I wasn"t.

1226
01:32:40,337 --> 01:32:42,208
Look, it wasn"t easy,
but I persuaded my dad

1227
01:32:42,252 --> 01:32:44,994
to buy out Club Caribe and

1228
01:32:45,037 --> 01:32:49,781
just so that we could partner
with its rightful owners.

1229
01:32:51,348 --> 01:32:54,003
So, how"s about this:

1230
01:32:54,046 --> 01:32:58,137
Your papa"s resort,
as run by me and you,

1231
01:32:58,181 --> 01:33:00,226
but we have to be honest
with each other.

1232
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:02,185
Fifty-fifty all the way.

1233
01:33:02,228 --> 01:33:04,274
Why should I trust you?

1234
01:33:06,232 --> 01:33:07,886
Everyone makes mistakes.

1235
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:13,022
Cheer up.

1236
01:33:13,065 --> 01:33:14,850
At least for the party.

1237
01:33:14,893 --> 01:33:16,112
All your friends are here.

1238
01:33:17,853 --> 01:33:19,332
I don"t understand.

1239
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:30,169
Haha!

1240
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:32,563
What a wonderful happening!

1241
01:33:33,869 --> 01:33:35,435
Papa, this is amazing!

1242
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:37,742
Amazing? It"s terrible!

1243
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:40,876
How can we have a party
without music?

1244
01:33:40,919 --> 01:33:43,748
The kind of music that you love!

1245
01:33:45,315 --> 01:33:47,143
Hey, you!

1246
01:33:47,186 --> 01:33:48,186
Come here!
