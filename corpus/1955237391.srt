1
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,631
That was a bomb.

2
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,872
No word as to
whether it was an ied
or a specific car bomb.

3
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,175
Over 10 fatalities reported.

4
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:21,113
Sources within isaf suggest
that isi may be involved.

5
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:25,784
Did these phones just
go down or did that
fucker hang up on me?

6
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,390
Good thing that x was bodgy
or I'd be flying right now!

7
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,298
I can't hear you, honey.

8
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:43,102
I need to talk to ed Faber.

9
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:46,839
Well, then who is
fronting the show?

10
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,840
I can't hear you!

11
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,376
Hey, that's my ass!
Do you have a mother?

12
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,088
Hello!

13
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,423
Fu...

14
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,573
<i> Listen up.</i>
<i> Iraq two is happening.</i>

15
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,209
The network is
stretched thin. All our
talent is going there.

16
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:28,247
We need people, any
people, to fill the void
in Afghanistan.

17
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:31,450
And you folks here
are all the unmarried,

18
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,886
childless personnel
in this bureau.

19
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,693
For those of you
who are behind
the scenes, there are

20
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,863
opportunities to
be on camera.

21
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,200
Kim, are you going
to be joining in?

22
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,936
The travel or the crying?

23
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,972
Um, hopefully,
the travel.

24
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:54,907
I'll think about it.

25
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,242
<i> The success</i>
<i> of operation mongoose</i>

26
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,012

<i> the real lesson</i>
<i> to be learned,</i>

27
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,749
<i> that the Taliban are</i>
<i> far from vanquished.</i>

28
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:04,850

00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05,584

I got you! Hey.

35
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,440
Uh, when do you get
back from Houston?

36
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,609
<i> I think on</i>

37
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,780

00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,525
- Like, three months.
<i>- What?</i>

43
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,532
Kim!

44
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,335
Hey!

45
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,571
I can't believe
this worked out!

46
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,839
Hey, you want to
have a quickie

47
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,741
on the changing table
in the bathroom?

48
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,376
Yeah, I don't think
i could get it up

49
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,378
with that little
koala looking at me.

50
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,914
Also, they're
boarding already.

51
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,349
Hey, don't worry.
Just go. Go, go, go.

52
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:14,586
Oh, shoot, I...
I copied a key
for you, so...

53
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,187
Plants, mail.

54
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,956
Anything else
I'm forgetting?
I think that's it.

55
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,224
This is crazy.

56
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,993
Listen, I think
it's impressive.

57
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,327
Starting a new career?

58
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,929
It's gonna be great.

59
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,365
And listen,
in three months...

60
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,033
"I'll be back."

61
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,234
No, that's terrible! No.

62
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,004
Don't remember
me like that. No.

63
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,207
Bye. Okay. Okay.

64
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,313
It's not my job.
I'm a producer.
General news. Enron.

65
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,948
These coalminers
in Pennsylvania,

66
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,416
but you probably
didn't see that.

67
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,151
'Cause we got two
wars going on now,

68
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,687
so, uh, I know how
to set up a bgan

69
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,222
and no one
will sue if I die

70
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:54,359
so I got an expedited visa,
like, two days ago,

71
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,963
and I guess now
I'm a war reporter.

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,700
Shit dick!

73
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,402
Corkscrew landing.

74
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:06,938
In case
a missile is fired
at the aircraft!

75
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,144
Kabul international airport.

76
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,147
K.I.A.! "Killed in
action."

77
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:19,484
<i> Once again, we thank you</i>
<i> for flying with us.</i>

78
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,163
Sorry.

79
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,998
Uh, sorry.

80
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,666
Shit.

81
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,038
No, thank you.
No, thank you.

82
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,142
Miss Baker?

83
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,311
I am fahim.

84
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,081
Oh, fahim, hi!
Pleased to meet you.

85
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,249
The car is over
here and we go.

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,622
She says, uh...
"Welcome to Afghanistan."

87
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:58,523
Okay, let's go.

88
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,493
Here is your local mobile.
The number is on the back.

89
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,029
Yeah, I ordered
some money last week.
Still in the post.

90
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,331
I'll fix you up next week.
Okay.

91
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,768
Yes, the air
here takes some
getting used to.

92
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,570
It's quite
polluted with feces.

93
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,772
Ah, here she is!
How are you, Kim?

94
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,674
Welcome to the Stan.
My name's nic.

95
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:16,975
I'll be doing
your security.
I'll take your bag.

96
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,612
Fahim. The police are giving
me shit for parking here.

97
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,314
They just want money.

98
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,349
Wait, oh, no. Um,
do you need money?

99
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,118
Because the network
gave me money.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,421
No, keep that on you!
No, no,
no! Kim, please!

101
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,763
Piss off, that's it!
That's it! Hey! Hey!

102
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,866
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Piss off!

103
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,946
Remember that we
are at altitude here,

104
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,816
so drink plenty of water
while you acclimatize.

105
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,451
Where did you learn English?

106
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,287
At medical school.
I was a doctor.

107
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,855
Listen, rest up tonight.

108
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,392
Tomorrow, I'll drive you
to the base for your embed.

109
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,460
And just one bag,

110
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,929
but make sure
you pack extra
socks and knickers.

111
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,666
That's like, um,
it's like "panties," yeah?

112
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,368
Mmm-hmm.

113
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,037
So, you've been
embedded before, then?

114
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,340
Not really. We all did
hostile-zone training in 2001.

115
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,411
They taught us to
open our mouths
if we get mortared...

116
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,647
That kind of stuff.

117
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,649
Okay.

118
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,626
G'day, qadar.

119
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,575
The feces smell
all the way to here.

120
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,517
Your room, Kim, is upstairs.

121
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,656
Yeah, they're
bloody addicted.

122
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,359
That one melted a laptop
downloading porno.

123
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,861
Jaweed, yes,

124
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,730
he likes to watch
men with donkeys.

125
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,265
Hi.
Hi.

126
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,100
It's unfortunate.

127
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,302
Kim, this is tall Brian.

128
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,537
Brian hooper.
Tall Brian.

129
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,438
Hi.
I'm your shooter.

130
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
So, is there another Brian
around here

131
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,142
somewhere that
you're taller than?

132
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,345
Short Brian.
Works for reuters.

133
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,314
Couldn't one of
you just be "Brian"?

134
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,917
Fair enough.
Didn't think of that.

135
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,819
Also short Brian's dead.

136
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,989
- Oh, fuck. Really?
- Yes.

137
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,726
Anyway, welcome
to the fun house.

138
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,701
Home sweet home.

139
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,371
This is your room.

140
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,308
Is there a shower?

141
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,471
<i> A nation accustomed to war</i>

142
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,641
<i> once again seeks</i>
<i> a return to normality.</i>

143
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:41,580
<i> And nothing symbolizes that</i>
<i> effort more than this place,</i>

144
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,148
<i> the Kabul zoo.</i>

145
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,383
No, he didn't. The zoo?

146
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,885
Go back to wapping.

147
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,353
You fucking tourist!

148
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:52,290
Uh, shit. Sorry.
I'm trying to
find the shower?

149
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,092
You're the new girl.

150
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,828
Oh, my god.
Uh... Kim Baker.

151
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,797
Just got here
from New York.

152
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,998
I'm Tanya. Oh, my god,

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,567
it's so nice to have another
woman in the house!

154
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,103
I love that lippy color.
What is that?

155
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,271
No, they're just
really chapped.

156
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,407
Oh, you poor thing.
Can I get you anything?

157
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:13,278
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out
because I saw your

158
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,282
special about your embed in
korengal, and it was amazing.

159
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,384
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

160
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:22,621
Where's the shower?
Yes. This way.

161
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,223
Can I ask a favor, Kim?

162
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,126
And absolutely
feel free to say no.
Yeah, sure.

163
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:28,893
I hate to even bring it up.

164
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,830
I feel so rude
even asking this.
No, it's fine.

165
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,933
Can I fuck your
security guys?

166
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,135
What? Oh.

167
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,170
By all means, yeah.

168
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,171
Yeah? I mean,
i wouldn't ask,

169
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,107
it's just that
for some reason,

170
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,042
the vbc use
an American contractor

171
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,578
and, I mean, no offense,
but they're all, like,

172
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,046
goatees and "fat-strong."

173
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,715
You know? But the aussies
and kiwis are so hot.

174
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,684
Right. I get it.
Be my guest.

175
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,786
You sure? Don't just
say that to be polite.

176
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:55,754
No, I wouldn't. I'm not.

177
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,590
Even nic? You don't
want nic for yourself?

178
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,158
Nic?

179
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,860
No. I don't. No.

180
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,562
That's... no, that
would never happen.
So you're good.

181
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:08,166
Hey! No, Kim,
don't say that.
You could have nic.

182
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,037
In Afghanistan,
you're a serious
piece of ass.

183
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,238
Thank you. That's nice.

184
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,040
Because you're what,
i mean, you're like,

185
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,410
a seven, a six or
seven in New York?

186
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,212
Here, you're a nine.

187
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,114
Borderline ten.

188
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,316
It's called "Kabul cute."

189
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,020
What are you here,
like a 15?

190
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,823
Yeah.

191
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,591
Huh.

192
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,795
The thing is, I have a very
serious boyfriend at home,

193
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:37,896
so, you're good.

194
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,097
All right, well, come talk
to me in two months

195
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,901
when your pussy's
eating your leg.
Shower's that way.

196
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,511
<i> How you doing?</i>

197
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,715
It's bananas here.
It's, um...

198
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,085
My nose is running.
There's shit in the air,

199
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,820
literally.

200
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,221
And

201
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,457
I don't think I can do this.

202
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,392
<i> Do what?</i>

203
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,893
<i> Kim?</i>

204
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,062
I don't think I can do this.

205
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,798
<i> Can you see...</i>
<i> I don't... hello?</i>

206
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,967
Shit.

207
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:34,919
I'm sorry, colonel,
i can't accept gifts
as a journalist.

208
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:35,954
Okay.

209
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,188
So lodging, transport,

210
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,791
chow and protection,
that's all you can accept?

211
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,159
I'll do my best
to stay objective.

212
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,462
I don't care if
you can do your job.
I care if my men can.

213
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:48,533
Are you familiar with
the term "four-ten-four",
miss Baker?

214
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,701
I am not, colonel.

215
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,504
It refers to women
who are fours back home

216
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,905
become tens when
they ship out

217
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:58,009
and when they're
back stateside, they
become fours again.

218
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,177
Are you saying I'm a four?

219
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:03,214
I'm saying you carry
an orange fucking backpack.

220
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:07,719
I've seen people
with actual experience
make bad decisions here.

221
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,321
So while you're outside
the wire with my men,

222
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,658
you will in no way
distract them,
understood?

223
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,594
Are you asking me not
to sleep with your soldiers?

224
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,863
No, not "soldiers."
Marines.

225
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:19,864
You're not here
to sleep with

226
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,568
or perform jobs of any
type on my marines.

227
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,470
Clear copy, miss Baker?

228
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,971
Copy that.
Good.

229
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,508
We'll get you out to
a fob as soon as we
find a ride for you.

230
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,943
In the meantime,
captain stern here

231
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,412
will see to it that
you get a wet hootch.

232
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,314
A what?

233
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,416
It's a tent with a shower.

234
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,452
Unless you'd
prefer a dry hootch.

235
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,354
I would not, sir.

236
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,214
Sorry.

237
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,718
Could you just...
State
your name and rank?

238
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,987
Gunnery sergeant
Clinton j. Hurd.

239
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,456
All right. Uh... dang it!

240
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,725
So, do you believe
the afghani people

241
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,194
are happy about
our presence here?

242
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,795
No, Afghans
are the people.

243
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:01,132
Afghanis is the currency.

244
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,834
That's right.
I knew that. Thank you.

245
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,136
What do you believe
your mission to be here?

246
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,504
Ma'am, you got
a sticker on your pants.

247
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,540
It's bugging
the shit out
of me. Ma'am...

248
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,842
Fahim.

249
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,076
What inspired you
to enlist originally?

250
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,982
I'm a big fan of
the movie <i> predator</i> with
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

251
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,284
We're the same height.

252
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,654
Do you think the war
in Iraq has affected
your resources here?

253
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:26,791
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I'm not authorized to
answer that question.

254
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,795
I'd say we're both
on the wrong side
of persia, ma'am.

255
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,730
Iraq is where you
get some right now.

256
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:33,564
Here just has shit all.

257
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,367
Are you guys getting
outside the wire much?

258
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,269
Yes, ma'am.
Most days. Uh...

259
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,572
You know, we help out with
community projects and all.

260
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,808
And Wells. Uh...

261
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,811
And sometimes at night
we shoot the big gun,

262
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,147
but, you know,
it's quiet here.
Jesus!

263
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,282
We don't wear
ibas on the fob.

264
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,918
I don't even chamber
a round in my weapon
anymore, because,

265
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,789
you know, I figure
accidental discharge is
scarier than the Taliban.

266
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:02,460
With Iraq, do you feel
like people have forgotten
about Afghanistan?

267
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,328
Oh, well...

268
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,332
Yes, ma'am. I'd say that
surely is the word for it.

269
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,468
This here's a forgotten war.

270
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,071
It's capital f, capital w.

271
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:16,274
What's your, uh...
Your name and rank?

272
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:21,012
I'm Lance corporal coughlin,
India company 3-5.

273
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,681
Thank you.

274
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,523
Kim. Your hair.

275
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,494
Thanks, fahim.
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,630
You really are a fixer.

277
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,870
Moon's out.

278
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,439
Hmm.

279
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,208
It's beautiful.

280
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,185
What does that mean?

281
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,989
It means, "oh, what
a terrible event!"
Uh-huh.

282
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:05,723
Miss Baker.

283
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,859
Colonel hollanek
is coming to
Norton tomorrow

284
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,327
to check on some
of our prt work.

285
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,996
And you and your crew
are clear to tag along.

286
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,164
Great, thanks.

287
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,066
Rolls out at zero-six.

288
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,136
That's 6:00 A.M.
i know that, yeah.

289
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,705
Fire!

290
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,775
Come on, let's go!
Get this shit together!
We gotta move!

291
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,543
Fucking hands out
of your pockets!

292
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,278
You think you're
in the fucking army?

293
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,682
What is this?

295
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,651
Uh, that's my supplies.
Camera stuff.

296
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,886
You fucking kidding me?

297
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:39,323
This is an orange
ruck. No, ma'am.
Not on my vehicle.

298
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,092
The girl at the
north face store

299
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,126
said it was,
like, military grade.

300
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,229
Well, where are you
gonna hide it?
Inside a fucking sunset?

301
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:49,434
I mean, even
the Dutch army
don't wear orange.

302
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,002
Fix it.

303
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,504
How do I fix it?

304
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,073
Rapono!

305
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,990
Got to stay hydrated, ma'am.

306
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,560
Coughlin.
I didn't recognize you.

307
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,962
That's 'cause I'm
in warrior mode.

308
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,364
It makes me
taller.

309
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,068
Enjoy the ride, ma'am.

310
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,528
I'm dying to
know who blew up my well.

311
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,363
Working on it, colonel.

312
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,199
That was a nice
fucking well, corporal.

313
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,305
What'd he say?

314
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,377
What's that mean?

315
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,280
He wants to know
if you are the Russians.

316
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,316
The Russians?
Mmm.

317
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,285
No!

318
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,121
No, sir. That was
20 years ago.

319
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,956
And we're here to help.

320
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,994
And I'm black.

321
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,838
If we fix the well,
you can't blow it up.

322
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,475
Kim, I was
talking to some
of the younger men.

323
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,410
They say
the Taliban
came at night.

324
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,213
I don't care. No.
I drank too much water
and I have to pee.

325
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:45,316
Stop. Stop.
I am engaged
to be married.

326
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:48,452
Okay, fahim,
i know you like your
women to be, like,

327
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,755
beautiful, mysterious
Ikea bags, okay?

328
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,759
But we urinate, doctor.
Out of our vaginas.

329
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,028
You think you
urinate out the...

330
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,763
No. I know it's
a separate thing!

331
00:19:58,765 --> 00:19:59,797
God! Just please help me.

332
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,732
There is
nowhere for you to go.

333
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,401
I cannot ask
these men about this.

334
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,902
And I'm not allowed
to talk to the women.

335
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:09,173
Fine. Forget it. I'll hold it.
Women are tough, right?

336
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,517
Are you okay, ma'am?

337
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,386
- Gosh, damn it, man.
- This is a new one.

338
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,924
I was cursing your
name at 0-stupid-30, but
I'm glad I came out today.

339
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,194
Would you not have
gone on patrol today
if I weren't here?

340
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,196
No, I'd be back in
Norton filling hescos.

341
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,331
Copy that.

342
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,367
We're still 5 Mikes.
It must be one hairy dump.

343
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,604
No, I'm just getting
my pants on.
Damn it, sergeant hurd.

344
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,705
Whatever.

345
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:41,973
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

346
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,107
Marine!

347
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,276
Make a hole, Baker.

348
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,783
Move out!

349
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,115
Why are we stopping?

350
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,916
The lead vehicle
bottomed out.

351
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,654
Okay!
Heads on a swivel!

352
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,223
Didn't we come this way?

353
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,058
We most surely did.

354
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,464
Contact left!
Stay in the vehicle!

355
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,538
Shit! Hot! Hot bullet things!

356
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:54,812
Kim, don't get out
of the car! Kim!

357
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,451
Whoa!

358
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:03,287
Get down behind
the engine block!

359
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,523
Stay there! Stay there!

360
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,958
Kim.

361
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,760
Get back in the car!

362
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,473
No, please, Kim!

363
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,923
Ma'am, I asked
you to stay put!

364
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:41,192
Those assholes
tried to shoot us!

365
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,361
Jesus!

366
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,229
You have got to
be shitting me!

367
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,699
You just shot
a javelin at
a fucking car!

368
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,701
That's an $80,000
piece of ordnance!

369
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,472
Can any of you
geniuses tell me the
kelley blue book value

370
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:57,908
of a 1989 Toyota pickup?

371
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,356
Oorah, Baker. Get some.

372
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,829
I hope you got all
that on film, ma'am.

373
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,699
'Cause that right there,
that's what we do best.

374
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,767
Hearts and minds.

375
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,203
That's the two best places
to shoot somebody.

376
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,075
What?

377
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,710
I told you to
stay in the car.

378
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,479
Okay, I'll get
back in the car.

379
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,915
<i> The marines don't have</i>
<i> much to say about Iraq.</i>

380
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,819
<i> Their mantra is that</i>
<i> they are focused on</i>
<i> doing the job here.</i>

381
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,854
<i> And even though,</i>
<i> as we saw firsthand,</i>

382
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,690
<i> attacks against</i>
<i> coalition forces are up,</i>

383
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:50,127
<i> corporal coughlin</i>
<i> told me earlier that</i>
<i> he is still not planning</i>

384
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,898

<i> when he is out on patrol.</i>

385
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,901
<i> Our own Kim Baker</i>
<i> reporting for us live.</i>

386
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,406
Welcome!

387
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,545
Wow, good job,
Kim! Ruthless!

388
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,817
Bitch, we are going
out tonight! Whoo!

389
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,413
It's okay. It's okay. Here.

390
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,319
It's okay. It's all right.

391
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,396
Why don't I know
who you are?

392
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,834
You're what, like, 42?

393
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:04,335
Sold.

394
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,569
Why have I never
heard of you?

395
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:09,206
Yeah, I haven't done
a lot of overseas reporting.

396
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:13,244
I've done mostly
domestic <i> reportage.</i>

397
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:14,979
<i> "Reportage"?</i>

398
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,414
Domestic <i> reportage.</i>

399
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:21,485
Look, everyone in
the kabubble is
full of shit. It's okay.

400
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,119
Half the accents are fake.

401
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:27,057
The whole "I'm
ex-special forces" wankers
are flat out lying.

402
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,260
<i> "Reportage"?</i>

403
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,397
Oh, Christ, what is this?

404
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,599
I really shouldn't have
my back to the door.

405
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,700
It's bad tradecraft,

406
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,271
but it's worth it to
talk to you two ladies.

407
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,107
Fuck off.
Ugh.

408
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,942
You got it.

409
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,279
Champagne?

410
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,880
Thank you.

411
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:50,314
Finish this,

412
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,650
and then we'll go
meet some friends
in wazir akbar Khan.

413
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,753
And I am warning you now,
do not sleep with iain.

414
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,122
Who is iain?
He's a proper asshole.

415
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,591
Shall we?
Yeah.

416
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,259
Is that a cab?

417
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,898
Is your
full name Shakira?

418
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,701
'Cause I thought it was
a Colombian nickname.

419
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:11,669
Why would you think that?

420
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,603
Because
of the singer.

421
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:17,508
No, I know.
I'm kidding. No, it's
arabic for "thankful."

422
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,943
Kim is American
for "white lady."

423
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:23,280
Actually, "Kim"
means "who" in turkish.

424
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,015
"Who's that white lady?"

425
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,183
It's Kim.

426
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,019
That's so you can
remember my name.

427
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,922
So... this is iain.
Iain, Kim.

428
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,026
Kim. Kim. Kim.
Kim, nice work.

429
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:39,263
You sit next to the
only two women in a
country the size of Texas

430
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,633
that remind a man
that you're really
only okay looking.

431
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,736
Well, she said
you were an asshole,

432
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,438
but that's really
above and beyond.

433
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,238
Who said that?
Tanya.

434
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,607
No. No. No.
I don't think so.

435
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,508
A lot of women find me
very charming, Kim.

436
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,478
No, not biological women.
Oh, really?

437
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,312
Women who think
that an accent

438
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,248
is the same thing
as a personality, maybe.
Oh!

439
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,883
<i> Nae, haud yer wheesht.</i>

440
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,786
<i> Go bile yer heid,</i>
<i> ya wee bampot.</i>

441
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,824
I bet you're wetter
than a submarine
with screen doors now.

442
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,058
Oh!

443
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,927
I got that from
a pickup book.

444
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,629
Jesus.
Oh, yeah.

445
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,863
Mmm.

446
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:13,964
So what's your deal?

447
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,733
You got chucked
over by some guy

448
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,067
so you think,
"forget him.

449
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,003
"I'm gonna go discover
the wonders of the east,

450
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,939
"and I'm gonna
fuck a Scottish guy
and write a book."

451
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,141
I'm Scottish,
by the way.

452
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,313
Cheers.

453
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,048
Cheers.

454
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,520
- Cheers.
<i>- Salud.</i>

455
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,023
- Cheers.
- To Kim!

456
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,793
Is this your
first night out?

457
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,328
Yes.

458
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,330
It is, actually.

459
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,334
That little bastard!

460
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:50,801
Oh, no, Kim.

461
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:54,004
You didn't give egg boy
money, did you?

462
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:58,242
Hey! Egg boy! Hey!
You're a little shitbird!

463
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,111
I hope you get salmonella!

464
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,247
Oh!

465
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,982
I gave him, like, $100!

466
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,517
$100?
What?

467
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,887
I'd give you
my eggs for $100.

468
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,255
Where are we going?

469
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:14,525
A whorehouse.
You're going to love it.

470
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,329
You see that?

471
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:22,299
It's a brothel
and a Chinese restaurant.

472
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,914
Do you remember this video?

473
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,451
Everybody was drawings.

474
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,389
Me? Oh, no, thank you.

475
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:49,593
Look, a month ago,
i was writing a story
about corn syrup.

476
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,794
Okay? I was not happy.

477
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:54,131
I didn't think
there was anything else
out there for me.

478
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:54,832
Just death.

479
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,534
Then this came
along and...

480
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:02,372
Wenge, do you guys
have regular
access to healthcare?

481
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,650
He called me
a fenian bastard.

482
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:17,121
I fuckin' showed him
what for, kicked
his teeth in, the cunt.

483
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:20,290
Oi, Tanya?
What's her story?

484
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:24,595
She has a boyfriend.
And she's unconscious, okay?

485
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,664
Not that either of
those things have ever
stopped you before.

486
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,399
That's not true.
That's not true.

487
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,902
Firstly, I'm afraid
of boyfriends.
Mmm-hmm.

488
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,171
Secondly, I'm a gentleman.

489
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:39,143
What? According to
no less an authority
than grace mugabe.

490
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,444
I held a door
open for her once.

491
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,247
Let me just
have a little peekaboo.

492
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:44,214
Get out!

493
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,650
Actually, not bad.

494
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:49,920
- I think I missed one.
- Stop!

495
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:53,223
<i> Il y a du monde</i>
<i> au balcon. Pas mal.</i>

496
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,158
Kim?

497
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,492
You all right
there, mate?

498
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,027
Oh, wouldn't you
like to know?

499
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,862
Hey. I'm just talking
about her safety.

500
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:03,200
Nic here does
security for Kim, iain.

501
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,242
Right, well!

502
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,212
I'm off. Excuse me.

503
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,146
Excused.
Good night.

504
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,882
- Bye, darling!
- Good night.

505
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,654
The best, nic!

506
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:38,168
Oh, that's Oprah.

507
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:50,647
Hello.

508
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,017
It's fahim.
Are you ready to go?

509
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,119
Go where, dude?
It's Saturday.

510
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:59,056
Friday is the only day off
in the islamic week.

511
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:00,057
We have interviews.

512
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,392
No! That was not made
clear. That's... no.

513
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,094
That's bullshit, fahim. No.

514
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:06,630
Kim, today we are
meeting Ali massoud sadiq.

515
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:10,467
<i> I sent research.</i>
<i> He's likely to be</i>
<i> Attorney General.</i>

516
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,175
Please hold.
Please come outside.

517
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:21,712
This is against
what I believe
as an American.

518
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,947
I am sorry, but
we have to go.

519
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,382
<i> Oh, my shoes. Shit.</i>

520
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,652
You wish to interview
me, Mr. ahmadzai?

521
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:32,289
I do, Mr. sadiq.
Yes, on camera.

522
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,091
Mr. ahmadzai,

523
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,193
I am a person of,

524
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,428
of no consequence.

525
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,363
Well, you soon might be

526
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:42,466
the second most powerful
person in Afghanistan.

527
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:42,933
Mr. ahmadzai,

528
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:46,336
I run a small department
inside the interior ministry.

529
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,706
What possible interest
could I be to the Americans?

530
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:53,577
Because your ministry
for the prevention of vice

531
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,912
and the encouragement
of virtue

532
00:31:54,914 --> 00:32:00,384
sounds a lot like
the Taliban's old
ministry of vice and virtue.

533
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,388
Don't you think?

534
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,098
- Kim Baker.
Mmm-hmm.

535
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,704
When the Taliban
was in power,

536
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,473
they enforced their
version of sharia.

537
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:24,541
One of their edicts
was a rule that

538
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,910
all men must shave
the hair of their pubis.

539
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:31,915
They would walk
the streets carrying
a small wooden rod,

540
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:32,516
a dowel,

541
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:35,986
which they would
roll along the front
of a man's trousers.

542
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:41,558
If a man's pubic hair
was long enough to
curl around the dowel,

543
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,895
they would beat him.

544
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,130
Now, I ask you,

545
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,733
do I look like a man
to walk the streets

546
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:53,303
carrying a
hair-of-the-pubis dowel?

547
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,039
No, sir, you do not.

548
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,911
I returned to this
country to save it.

549
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:02,879
I am a friend of America.

550
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,681
Which is why you should
let me interview you,

551
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,584
so people can
understand that.

552
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,420
I like you, Kim.

553
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,089
I like your mouthiness.

554
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:14,691
That is a word, yes?

555
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,594
It reminds me of
my time living in London.

556
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:22,299
You make me feel
like a young man
again.

557
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,168
But I do not know you.

558
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:30,374
How can we
get to know
each other, Kim?

559
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,044
Hmm?

560
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,117
Yes, excellent, Kim!

561
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,788
Put a turban on her,
she'd make
a very handsome boy.

562
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,926
<i> How are you?</i>
<i> You okay there?</i>

563
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:25,328
<i> What the hell was that?</i>

564
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,631
It's probably
just a wedding
somewhere nearby.

565
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,800
They like to shoot off
guns at weddings here.

566
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,902
You get it,
you're from Florida.

567
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,036
<i> Funny.</i>

568
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,905
<i> When was the last</i>
<i> time I saw you?</i>

569
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:35,906
<i> Since June?</i>

570
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:39,109
I'm sorry that I didn't
get back last month.

571
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:41,478
I can be in New York
by Thursday.

572
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,248
I miss you and I want
to see you. And I...

573
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,283
I have...

574
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,952
Oh, not again.

575
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,756
I hate this
fucking airport.

576
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,759
Can I bring you guys
anything from New York?

577
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,096
Just bring us back
a six pack, eh?

578
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,665
- This is Kim.
<i>- Kim Baker?</i>

579
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,867
It is sadiq.

580
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,903
Mr. sadiq, hi.

581
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,240
How about an interview
with pacha Khan?

582
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,908
Pacha Khan, the warlord?

583
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,244
<i> Pacha Khan is a businessman.</i>

584
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,011
Would you like that?

585
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,815
Uh, yeah. Yeah. But I'm
on my way to New York
to see my boyfriend.

586
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,218
<i> You will be the first</i>
<i> western journalist</i>

587
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,354
<i> to interview him</i>
<i> since the Soviet war.</i>

588
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,591
<i> Shall we say tomorrow?</i>

589
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,333
Okay, yes, of course.
Thank you.

590
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,170
What?
Back in the car.

591
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,241
Wait here.

592
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,682
It's okay, come.

593
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,309
Hmm.

594
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,113
Okay. Yes.
Yeah?

595
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,582
Okay.

596
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,088
Pacha Khan, thank you
for your kind hospitality.

597
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,273
What?

598
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,109
No.

599
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,246
Oh, Kim. Cheers.

600
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,380
Hi.

601
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:30,880
What a rush, yeah?

602
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:35,685
Pacha Khan, yeah.
It's like, adrenaline.
Everyone was...

603
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,020
Good job.

604
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:38,054
Yeah, it went well.

605
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:41,591
But, you know, I was...
I was in the...

606
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,826
The New Zealand
sas back home.

607
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:45,729
And today felt
like jumping out
of an airplane.

608
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:49,933
Or like, you know,
like having sex.

609
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,739
Kim!

610
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,843
Tanya's got scotch.
It won't last long, so...

611
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:03,046
Nic, you're welcome,
too, you big cunt!

612
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:07,284
That's a term of
affection, by the way.

613
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:12,422
You were
supposed to be in
New York, sneaky girl.

614
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,725
Yeah, Chris is
not super pleased.

615
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,461
Chris can
suck a fat one.

616
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,731
I'm trying to see if
they put my story up,

617
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,401
but this Internet
connection is the worst!

618
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,970
Oh, goddamn it, jaweed!

619
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,405
Oh, Christ!

620
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,172
- Really?
- Wow.

621
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:33,009
Although, donkeys aside,
he's a good fixer.
Mmm.

622
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,813
Oh, no, thanks.
Morning shows.

623
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,916
You have something they
want for the mornings?

624
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:44,587
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe.

625
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:45,221
Hmm.

626
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,590
That's what
I'm trying to see.

627
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,695
You know, I heard
that he has contacts
in the tribals.

628
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:55,031
Like real Taliban contacts.

629
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,633
- Jaweed?
- Jaweed.

630
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:59,369
- No fucking way.
- Mmm, apparently.

631
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:03,106
Would you do that?
Would you go down there?

632
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,045
Yeah, sure, if it
was the right call.

633
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,948
Yeah, but how do you know
if it's the right call?

634
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,986
Fuck, man, I don't know.

635
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,755
That is why we
drink, do drugs

636
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:22,225
and shag strangers
in restaurant bathrooms.

637
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,748
<i> Kim, are you okay?</i>
<i> What's going on?</i>

638
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,950
Oh, shoot. Oh, sorry,
what time is it?

639
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:48,218
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> I'm in Seattle.</i>

640
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,020
<i> God, I thought you got shot</i>
<i> at a wedding or something.</i>

641
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,155
<i> Jesus, Kim!</i>
No.

642
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,190
Sorry. So, just real quick...

643
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,492
I want you to come visit me.

644
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,760
<i> In Afghanistan? Really?</i>

645
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:57,927
I mean, I've got
tons of miles.

646
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:58,595
I could fly you first class.

647
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,864
<i> I have to look at a</i>
<i> calendar. I don't think</i>
<i> I can do it this month.</i>

648
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,399
<i> I'm here until,</i>
<i> like, at least the 15th.</i>

649
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,433
<i> But when I get</i>
<i> back maybe...</i>

650
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,269
Who is in your bed, Chris?
<i> What?</i>

651
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,371
<i> No, that's my bag.</i>

652
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,141
Look in the mirror, dipshit.

653
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,345
My god. You motherfucker.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

654
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,479
<i> You calm the fuck down!</i>

655
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,448
<i> Listen, you haven't</i>
<i> been home in months.</i>

656
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,416
<i> You forgot my</i>
<i> fucking birthday!</i>

657
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,184
Oh, right, it's my
fault. Great, Chris.
You're a genius.

658
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,420
<i> And I kept your stupid</i>
<i> fucking plants alive,</i>

659
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:27,023
<i> but you let this relationship</i>
<i> wither and die!</i>

660
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:30,760
Ugh! Did you
have that prepared?

661
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:31,494
<i> What?</i>
Pussy!

662
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:32,729
You know what?
Have fun in Seattle.

663
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,130
You should go to the
rock 'n' roll museum.

664
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,199
It sucks.
You'll fit right in.

665
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,621
Are you shitting me?

666
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:06,896
Fahim.

667
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:09,265
Let's apply for
another embed.

668
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,000
Because I want to
get out of Kabul.

669
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:15,038
I just need to
get out of Kabul.

670
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,208
I need "me time",
exactly. That's...

671
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,576
See? I told you
that <i> o</i> magazine

672
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:23,379
would increase your
understanding of women.

673
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,059
Hey, you guys
are 3-5, right?

674
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,261
Do you know
a corporal coughlin?

675
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:38,795
No, ma'am.

676
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:42,165
Sorry, but I've only
been here for
a couple months.

677
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,168
Ma'am, if you set one foot
in front of the other,

678
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,272
there's less chance
you lose both feet
if we hit an ied.

679
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,711
<i> Vides, make ready.</i>

680
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,719
Man, we are
definitely losing
the war

681
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,221
when it comes to
this particular well.

682
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,323
I swear to god,
they blow up another well,

683
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,591
I take another
pair of boots off.

684
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:11,594
It's like fucking
musical chairs.

685
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,497
Hey, do I have to
buy a dress
for your wedding?

686
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:18,568
No. Whatever you
wear in Kabul is fine.

687
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,037
Yeah?
Yes.

688
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,109
The only thing I ask
is that you make sure
my friend is there.

689
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,079
Aw, your friend is me.

690
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,216
I get it.

691
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,740
Mount up!
Jesus, stern!

692
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:34,611
General, excuse me.
Hey. General, do you
have a minute?

693
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,912
Not now, Baker.

694
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,080
It's just...

695
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,916
The Taliban haven't been
destroying the well here.

696
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:43,019
The women of the village
are destroying it.

697
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,121
Or so they tell me.

698
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,826
We dug that well
several times
for the women

699
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:51,794
so they don't have
to walk to the river.

700
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,563
But they want to
walk to the river.

701
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:56,199
It's their only
chance to be social

702
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,201
and gossip and,
you know, hang out.

703
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:01,170
I think that they
have a bunch of
old Soviet landmines,

704
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:05,308
and they just prop one up
and throw rocks at it.

705
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,689
Kim, did you ever feel like
you're Manning that tollgate

706
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:23,493
and the engineer's yelling,
"i got pig iron,
i got pig iron"?

707
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,429
No. I don't know
what that means.
But it's very folksy.

708
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,931
Also, the women, obviously,
they don't want the men

709
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,266
to know about this,
so they are hoping

710
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:33,603
that you would just refuse
to repair the well this time.

711
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:34,170
Well, they're in luck.

712
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,540
That's exactly what
i told the mullah, so...

713
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,778
Well done, Baker.

714
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,047
Hooyah, general.

715
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,283
Marines say "oorah."

716
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,352
The Navy says "hooyah."

717
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:52,055
Don't mix those two up.
Got it.

718
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,857
Have a good...
Have a good ride.

719
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,582
Kim.

720
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,553
Kim.

721
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:28,991
Sorry.

722
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,240
You look beautiful!
You look beautiful!

723
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,541
Oh, my god.

724
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,482
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, no!

725
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:54,016
Kim!

726
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,319
What the dick?

727
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,187
Why did fahim tell me
i could dress like this?

728
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,857
Well, he didn't
want you to have to
go buy something.

729
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:03,126
Oh, my god. I only washed
the front of my hair.

730
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,861
Here.
You know what?

731
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,063
I'm going to let you
have one of these.

732
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,564
Thank you.

733
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:09,832
Now I look great.

734
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,200
Now you're ready.

735
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,468
Now I'm ready to party.

736
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,636
Oh, she likes it.

737
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,672
- Sure.
- Oh, wow. Well...

738
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:38,895
It was worse than
a unibrow. It went all
the way into his hair.

739
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:41,864
We all have some reason
for being here.

740
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:43,599
What's your reason?

741
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:44,267
What is yours?

742
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,601
I don't have a good one.
I'm just here.

743
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,770
Come on, she just told
her unibrow story.

744
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,572
I just... I don't have one.

745
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:50,940
Come on.

746
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:56,879
I was at the gym after work
one night. Stationary bike.

747
00:46:56,881 --> 00:47:00,082
Okay? The same
bike every day.

748
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:02,752
And I notice this

749
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:03,653
indentation in the carpet,

750
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,721
it's, like, a foot
in front of my bike.

751
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:10,092
And I realize that it's from
where my bike used to be.

752
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:16,666
I have done thousands
of miles on this bike

753
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,168
and I have gone backwards.

754
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,938
I have literally
gone backwards.

755
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,805
I just

756
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:26,108
wanted to blow everything up.
I just wanted out of my job,

757
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,546
writing news scripts for
dumb pretty people to read.

758
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,381
I wanted...

759
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,183
...out of having
to decide whether

760
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:38,521
I should just
marry my mildly
depressive boyfriend.

761
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,223
And that's it.

762
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,359
I just... I couldn't
look at that

763
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,595
fucking carpet anymore.

764
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,900
Oh...

765
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,304
Well, that is
officially the most

766
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,640
American white lady
story I've ever heard.

767
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:00,409
- Shut up.
- It is.

768
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,377
You know what?
Fuck that.

769
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:06,282
You are a battle-tested
foreign correspondent.

770
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:09,485
You're a solid Kabul 9.5.

771
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,654
And you are fucking
single, all right?

772
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:15,558
So that lady back at
the gym, she's dead.

773
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,894
This is your life.

774
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,019
<i> Despite Taliban threats,</i>
<i> election observers</i>

775
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:45,187

776

781

<i> The surprise visit</i>

785
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,218
Thank you.

786
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,822
Congratulations
on your promotion,

787
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:21,390
Mr. Attorney General.
Thank you.

788
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,059
As I said, we could have
done this over the phone.

789
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:25,928
I'm just looking
for a statement on
sharia in kandahar.

790
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,897
I understand that
you are no longer

791
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:30,466
with your
special friend Chris.

792
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,468
Who told you that?

793
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,869
Very little happens
in Afghanistan

794
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:37,707
that Ali massoud sadiq
does not know about.

795
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,175
Very little.

796
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:40,676
May I show you something?

797
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,078
Of course.

798
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,819
You have a bed in your office.

799
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,153
Yes.

800
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,823
There is a bed here now.

801
00:49:55,759 --> 00:50:00,763
So, no comment on
sharia in kandahar or...

802
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:05,701
No comment.

803
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,504
We are going to
isaf later, yes?
I don't know.

804
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,207
Pressers and
"right of boom" crap.
Who cares?

805
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:12,508
We need
to enterprise
something. Okay?

806
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,478
We need to get
out of the bubble.

807
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,179
Oh, that hit the net.

808
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,248
The what?
It hit the net.

809
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,150
The invisible net?
Yes.

810
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:22,218
My point.
Let's go. Bullshit.

811
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,221
You know, Kim, the reason
that your village well
story got traction is

812
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:28,357
because it wasn't a bang-bang,
it was about women's rights.

813
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,326
It was a brilliant
piece, that.

814
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:31,861
Oh, fucking hell.

815
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,196
We should go to kandahar.

816
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:34,697
No, too dangerous.

817
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,833
No way. It's a wee bit
fluid down there these days,

818
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:38,334
security-wise.

819
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:40,436
Yeah, it might
be a bit much
for you, eh, nic?

820
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:41,437
You're a bit
late to the whole

821
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:42,838
"kandahar's gone
to shit" party.
You know?

822
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,940
What about the woman thing
where the sharia law is back?

823
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:46,809
And there was
a firebombing there
the other day.

824
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:47,910
Yeah, I think
it's worth the risk.

825
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:49,311
Iain, that's easy for
you to say, mate,

826
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:52,314
sitting there in your
cozzie taking photos
of the fucking garden.

827
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:54,917
Look, Nicky,
i know you've been
specially trained

828
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:58,054
to protect New Zealand from,
what, fucking dolphins?

829
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,922
But I'm not exactly
a war zone virgin, you know?

830
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:03,559
I was kidnapped by
the aig when they
were still called that.

831
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,294
Why dolphins?

832
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:06,829
What do dolphins got to
do with New Zealand?

833
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:08,097
Nothing to do
with it. I'm just...

834
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,131
White pointers and sharks,

835
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:09,965
but the dolphins
never hurt anyone.

836
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:12,668
I know they've not
hurt anyone, mate.
I'm just making the point...

837
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,070
I'm not gonna
protect my country

838
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,305
from an animal that
hasn't hurt anyone.

839
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:17,673
Oh, Jesus Christ.

840
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,909
Dolphins? What a joke.

841
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,510
I'll come with you
in the car if there's room.

842
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:24,313
Oh, great,
we're all going
to kandahar!

843
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:29,452
I can make some calls.
We can take my car.

844
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,620
Kim, if we are
going to kandahar,

845
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:34,924
you will need to
buy some new clothes.

846
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,692
I can't...

847
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,871
Ah! It's so pretty,
i don't even want to vote.

848
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,401
I'm flipping you the bird
in here right now.

849
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:20,803
- Is this your car, fahim?
- Yes.

850
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,438
This is a fucking
piece of shit.

851
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,807
I think it's very nice.

852
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,779
No one is staring
at me. It's weird.

853
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:34,383
You are in
the blue prison now.

854
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,285
Fahim, what does
the graffiti say?

855
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,787
"No education for woman."

856
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,960
Brian.
Huh?

857
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,517
Fahim, what's
going on up there?

858
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,821
The Taliban used to do this.

859
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:49,225
Execute the radios
and televisions.

860
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,231
Oh, shit!

861
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,669
Get out of the way!

862
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:01,604
Move on! Move on!

863
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:04,807
You guys can't go
out there, but I can.

864
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,815
- Kim, come back.
- Kim, wait! Come back.

865
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,559
Kim, now.
We must hurry.
We must hurry.

866
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,643
Get in the car!

867
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:19,014
Get out of here!

868
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:25,487
That was a men's
park, Kim! Men only!

869
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,324
Fuck!

870
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,594
<i> Bebakhshid,</i> fahim.

871
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,936
...coalition capacity,

872
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:41,704
priorities and support.

873
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:47,810
Let's look now at
the 12 first-tier drivers
in the current coin paradigm.

874
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:48,544
Shit.

875
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:50,446
Tactical and institutional...

876
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:52,247
...is always in purple,

877
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:54,116
and noting as such...

878
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,784
<i> Kim Baker.</i>

879
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,119
Sir, do you have a minute?

880
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,954
If I'm
understanding
this briefing,

881
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,422
I have all
the fucking time
in the world.

882
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:03,325
Okay.
Well, I'm covering
the girls' school

883
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,126
in kandahar
that was firebombed

884
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:07,830
and I'm wondering
if you could give me
something, on background,

885
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:11,200
just about the security
situation here

886
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,369
and the state of
the war in general.

887
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,870
Yeah, I can give
you something:

888
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,171
This war is like
fucking a gorilla.

889
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:19,308
You keep going till
the gorilla wants to stop.

890
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,744
I think I can
paraphrase that.

891
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,746
<i> Knock yourself out.</i>

892
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:43,065
You know, Afghanistan
produces 90% of the
world's narcotic opiates.

893
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,067
- So they say.
- Mmm.

894
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,570
When I worked
in the hospital,

895
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,507
these men, heroin addicts,

896
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:54,109
would come in
with a child.

897
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:57,813
They'd say,
"oh, my son,
he broke his arm."

898
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,749
And while we were
tending to the child,

899
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,051
the men would
steal our morphine.

900
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:07,856
And we would wonder
how the arm got
broken to begin with.

901
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:10,793
What are we
talking about, fahim?

902
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:12,327
Hmm.

903
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:16,498
The human body
produces its own heroin.

904
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,067
In fact, when
the fight-or-flight instinct

905
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:21,036
is activated in
the hypothalamus,

906
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:27,142
your body releases endorphins,
dopamine and norepinephrine.

907
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:31,647
That is heroin, cocaine
and amphetamine, all at once.

908
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:35,918
Okay, great. Are we
having the Afghan version
of this conversation,

909
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,919
where in New York
we would have

910
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:40,322
gotten to the point,
like, five minutes ago?

911
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,060
There is a reason to
believe that a person

912
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:48,330
can get addicted to
this type of high.

913
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,400
Soldiers, athletes...

914
00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:53,635
War reporters. Got it.

915
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:57,573
An addict always
needs a greater
and greater dosage.

916
00:57:57,575 --> 00:58:01,910
And then people
make mistakes,
people get hurt.

917
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:04,780
I get it. You're
a newlywed. I can

918
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:08,250
probably get them
to go up to $125 a day.

919
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,693
Let us have the

920
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:22,364
American version of
this conversation.

921
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:23,866
Okay.

922
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,636
I do not want to
work with you anymore.

923
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:30,372
No, okay, wait.
Fahim, I know I fucked up.

924
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:33,141
I do not think you do.

925
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,343
Hear me out.

926
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,244
Kim, no.

927
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:40,215
I am now married.
I want to have children.

928
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,884
It will not happen again.
It's not gonna...

929
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:48,223
"I ride after a deer
and find myself
chased by a hog.

930
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,659
"I plot to get what I want

931
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,594
"and I end up in prison.

932
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:56,932
"I dig pits to trap
others and I fall in.

933
00:58:56,934 --> 00:59:00,569
"I should be
suspicious of
what I want."

934
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:04,106
I don't know
what that means.

935
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,745
You do.

936
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:17,920
Fahim?

937
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,798
I can't breathe in here.

938
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,100
Time to take a walk.

939
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,302
I have to go outside.

940
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,972
I have to go home.

941
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:35,864
Shit.

942
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:37,733
It's the wrong house.

943
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,339
Oh, shit.

944
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,164
Kim?

945
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,500
What the hell are you doing?

946
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:16,071
Here.

947
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:20,842
Kim, sip that.
Okay? You all right?

948
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,613
Keep sipping that.
You're all right. It's okay.

949
01:01:24,615 --> 01:01:26,348
It's okay. Hey.

950
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:27,783
Hey, it's all right.

951
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,886
Oi. Now, that there
was a bit of fun.

952
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,220
Are you mental?
Okay, mate...

953
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,056
I'm not your mate.
I'm gonna ask you again,

954
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,023
are you fucking mental?

955
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,825
Come on, iain,
it's not his fault.

956
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,126
What's your job again? Hmm?

957
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,961
Because if I hadn't
come back to see you lot

958
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:41,163
because I stole
a bottle of sake

959
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:42,531
from a Japanese
travel writer...

960
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,398
Wait, you have sake?

961
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,133
...you could've
killed her, "mate!"

962
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,335
Oh, fuck off.

963
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,505
Jesus! What the
fuck?

964
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,541
Dude, what the fuck?

965
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:54,910
Did you fucking
sucker punch me?

966
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:56,378
You broke my nose.

967
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,780
You fucking American?
Are you a yank?

968
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:01,383
I'm Canadian, you asshole.
Ugh.

969
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:02,718
I almost fucked a Canadian?

970
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,821
I'd stay down if i
were you, ya wee cunt.

971
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,690
And that's not
a term of affection.

972
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,126
Fuck that.

973
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:24,072
Oh, god! Mmm.

974
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,175
Ow!

975
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:27,709
Wait.
Oh, fuck.

976
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:32,380
Iain, don't carry me around.
I'm not a fucking baby.

977
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,883
Ah!
Goddamn it.

978
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:37,085
What the fuck are you doing?

979
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,358
Take it off.
I'm fucking
trying to take it off!

980
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,794
Oh, god, I'm gonna put it
in you so fucking hard,

981
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:47,429
you're gonna
fucking get it.
Shh. Don't talk.

982
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,897
I want everything
in your mouth.

983
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:49,564
Iain, just shut it.

984
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:52,234
I'll take you
lying down, come on.

985
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:55,103
Do you have one of those
weird little penises?

986
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,405
No! This is how
i want to go.

987
01:02:57,407 --> 01:03:00,075
No, I don't want
to see myself.

988
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:01,510
Roll off!

989
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,979
Okay, fuck it.

990
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:08,350
Oh, god, I fucking...

991
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:08,884
What are you doing?

992
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:12,020
I'm just putting my fucking
finger in your mouth.

993
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:12,487
Shh. No!

994
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:15,757
Come on, just put
everything in your mouth.

995
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,160
Do you want me to go?

996
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,661
No.

997
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,677
There's aught
like a good shag.

998
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,413
Okay, let's try to
be adults here.

999
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:39,514
I think we were.

1000
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:43,285
Obviously this was just
a kabubble thing, right?

1001
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:44,319
Just a

1002
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:48,056
fun mistake where one
of us had an orgasm.

1003
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:52,027
I mean, we're both
in a really bad place.
And then you

1004
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:54,162
punched nic.

1005
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,698
I don't know.
It's endorphins, right?

1006
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,034
Nope, that's not
what this is.

1007
01:03:59,036 --> 01:04:01,136
No, you don't
need to be gallant.

1008
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:03,305
I'm serious.

1009
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:07,475
I fancy you, Kim Baker.

1010
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:08,777
I do.

1011
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:12,781
Of all the dozens of women
in this country, I chose you.

1012
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:15,016
No, you didn't,
because this is not me.

1013
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:15,884
I would never do this.

1014
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:18,453
Precisely. Because
you're not you anymore.

1015
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,755
You're in the kabubble.
You said so yourself.

1016
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:23,725
Don't fucking hide.

1017
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,761
Kim, you know the frog
in the pot of water?

1018
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:30,365
You raise
the temperature
bit by bit,

1019
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,500
the frog doesn't notice?

1020
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,002
That's what this place

1021
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,004
and that's what this job
does to all of us.

1022
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:40,575
It changes your perception
of what's normal until...

1023
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,179
...until here we are.

1024
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,348
You know the frog
boils to death

1025
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,383
at the end of that, right?
Nope.

1026
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,018
Yeah.
Nope.

1027
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,127
Is that my toothbrush?

1028
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,595
Ugh!

1029
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:03,865
<i> What's going on</i>
<i> with my kandahar piece, ed?</i>

1030
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,400
<i> Jerry killed it.</i>

1031
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,134
Wait, who killed it?

1032
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:08,670
<i> Jerry Taub,</i>
<i> head of the network, Kim.</i>

1033
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:10,372
What happened to Angela?
<i> She left.</i>

1034
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:13,608
<i> She's running a website</i>
<i> for women or something.</i>

1035
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:17,479
<i> Look, I can't sell</i>
<i> Afghanistan in</i>
<i> Monday meetings.</i>

1036
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:21,116
<i> Your war's got chronic</i>
<i> same-shit-different-day-itis.</i>

1037
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:23,585
Great. What am i
even doing here, ed?

1038
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:26,655
<i> I wouldn't ask</i>
<i> that too loudly, Kim.</i>

1039
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:31,393
<i> Though I'd be thrilled to have</i>
<i> you back at your old desk.</i>

1040
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:38,733
That's all I got.

1041
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:45,173
Hey, I heard that nic quit
and you fucked iain!

1042
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:45,840
Whoa, hold on.

1043
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:48,310
Listen, the iain thing
is not a thing, okay?

1044
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:50,345
We have the same
size hands. I can't.

1045
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:53,548
It's just work has been
a little frustrating.

1046
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,182
Yeah. I get it.

1047
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:56,551
Because Afghanistan
doesn't rate anymore.

1048
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:57,552
That is bullshit.

1049
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,788
You've got to find
your own luck here, babe,

1050
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,423
you know that.

1051
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,627
What?

1052
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,495
What? What is that?

1053
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:10,365
Hey! You're hooking up
Tanya in the tribals?

1054
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:11,633
What the fuck, jaweed?

1055
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:12,934
Her network
will pay me triple.

1056
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:15,337
I taught you how to clear
your Internet history, okay?

1057
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:17,272
What has vanderpoel
ever done for you?

1058
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:18,273
Give me a break, man.

1059
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:20,942
Whatever. You owe me.
What else do you have?

1060
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:21,843
You're ghilzai, right?

1061
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:23,411
Do you have any
other connections

1062
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:24,879
to members of
the ghilzai family?

1063
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,448
You mean hekmatyar?
Maybe.

1064
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,117
Are you fucking
crazy, Kim? Please.

1065
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,020
Hey! Nabil! Hey.

1066
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,955
Are you still in touch
with that isi guy

1067
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:36,558
who says he knows
who killed Abdul haq?

1068
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,894
That guy?
He's dead two years.

1069
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:54,909
Hey.

1070
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,020
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1071
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:06,788
Mrs. mackelpie.

1072
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:11,693
Twice?

1073
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,128
Two and
a half, actually.

1074
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,162
Ugh!

1075
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:16,831
I don't remember
what happened last night.

1076
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,933
Kabul happened,
my wee froggy in the pot.

1077
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:21,803
Did I not wear
a headscarf?
Where's my phone?

1078
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:23,738
I believe I threw your
mobile in my cupboard.

1079
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:24,239
Why?

1080
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,241
Because mid-coitus
you tried to call Tanya

1081
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:29,077
about some bloody
wild goose chase
in the tribals.

1082
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,111
I told you about that?

1083
01:07:30,113 --> 01:07:31,046
Mmm. Well, it was hard
to understand you

1084
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:34,749
once you asked me
to stuff your knickers
in your mouth.

1085
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,619
I'm joking, Kim.
That didn't happen.

1086
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,487
Fuck. I am...

1087
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,856
I am fucking losing it.

1088
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,191
I need a win.

1089
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:44,125
Christ, if you're
that hard up,

1090
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:46,494
I'll share my badakhshan
thing with you.

1091
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:47,295
What badakhshan thing?

1092
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:50,165
You know China
won the contract to
mine for gold up there.

1093
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,734
They built roads, airport,
housing, all that.

1094
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,936
Well, guess whose
responsibility it is

1095
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:57,305
to protect
the investment
of red China

1096
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,007
in this restive nation?

1097
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:03,378
American troops, Chinese gold.
Oh, iain, that's really good.

1098
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,212
People are gonna get mad.

1099
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,814
Just waiting for
my guy to give me
the green light.

1100
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:09,084
You pay for the trip,
I'll share the story
with you. Easy peasy.

1101
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,387
Really? Thank you. That's...

1102
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:13,888
I owe you one.

1103
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:16,591
Well, how about
a half of one?

1104
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,026
And then we can
make it an even three.

1105
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:20,695
Yeah. Or I could
buy you breakfast.

1106
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:23,331
Or a half of one
and we can make
it an even three.

1107
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:26,768
I think breakfast is of
equal monetary value.

1108
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,770
My middle name is eoghan.

1109
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:31,106
Which is erse... shut up.

1110
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:32,807
It's erse for Owen.

1111
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:33,975
"Oo-hee"?
Mmm-hmm.

1112
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:36,244
Iain "oo-hee."
Don't bother.

1113
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:37,145
Where is bin laden?

1114
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:38,913
People think he's
in Pakistan, right?

1115
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:39,414
Yeah.

1116
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:41,683
You've got egg in
your beard. Hang on.

1117
01:08:41,685 --> 01:08:42,417
Thank you.

1118
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:45,487
Your national animal
is the unicorn.

1119
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:46,054
I think it's romantic.

1120
01:08:46,056 --> 01:08:48,490
That is the national animal
of the kingdom I ruled

1121
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:49,591
when I was eight.

1122
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:51,593
Who's your
favorite three stooge?

1123
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:55,897
Um, Larry. Because
he's put upon in a way
that I identify with.

1124
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:59,200
He's the
art Garfunkel, right?

1125
01:08:59,202 --> 01:08:59,634
Yeah.

1126
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,538
So, I thought I might
like to hang out
with you for a bit.

1127
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,640
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1128
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,876
Do you really want to
know what I want to do?

1129
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:08,743
Yeah. Okay.

1130
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:10,612
I'd like to kiss you.

1131
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,216
Who knew?

1132
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,221
Here's my little man.

1133
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:22,457
No, iain, don't. It's a scam.

1134
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,692
Do you think so? Really?

1135
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:27,061
I know it's a scam,
Kim. So what?

1136
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:30,131
He's still
begging in the street.
Hey, abrahaim.

1137
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,400
There's my boy.

1138
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,946
I knew I'd win you over.

1139
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,686
Jesus!

1140
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,763
What the fuck, jaweed?
Are they coming or not?

1141
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:03,498
Here they are.

1142
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,971
<i> There they are.</i>

1143
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:14,309
4-6800, line six north.

1144
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,081
Standing by approval.

1145
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,783
We are clear
to engage target.

1146
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:24,452
Roger. Clear to
engage target.

1147
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,761
It is him. That's my guy.

1148
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:36,197
If we go anywhere,
jaweed, we take our vehicle.

1149
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:37,232
No carpooling.

1150
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:38,933
All right. Okay.

1151
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:49,043
Shit! Shit!

1152
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:50,812
Stay calm.

1153
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,120
Splash.

1154
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:00,388
Cease laser. Safe laser.

1155
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,557
Laser off. Laser safe.

1156
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:29,117
I'm looking for
someone. Excuse me.

1157
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,026
Oh, my god. Tanya.
Hi.

1158
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:39,827
Jesus.
Oy.

1159
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,031
Jaweed's dead.

1160
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:44,265
Andy's in surgery.

1161
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:46,134
I know. Iain
talked to Colin.

1162
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:47,302
Jesus!

1163
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:49,203
I know. It's fucked.

1164
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,541
You know, Colin was rolling.

1165
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,644
What, like, rolling-rolling?
You have tape?

1166
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,146
He got the whole
fucking thing.

1167
01:11:58,148 --> 01:12:02,483
I'm going to go live
with it as soon as
they let me out of here.

1168
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,187
Can you fucking believe it?

1169
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:08,022
Hey.

1170
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:09,490
Hi.

1171
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:10,958
Aye.

1172
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:12,894
- How are you?
- You doing all right?

1173
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:16,064
Holy shit!

1174
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:17,732
<i> And as we watch it</i>
<i> again there, Susanna,</i>

1175
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:22,203
<i> you can actually see</i>
<i> the hellfire missile</i>
<i> right before it detonates.</i>

1176
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,409
What is going on
with badakhshan?

1177
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,578
Ah, snow's killing us.

1178
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,546
So unless your network wants

1179
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:33,281
to stump up the money
for the helicopter,

1180
01:12:33,283 --> 01:12:35,750
we'll have to wait till
they clear the passes.

1181
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:38,052
Kim, we have a bit
of a situation outside.

1182
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:39,253
Oh.

1183
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:40,154
What?

1184
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:42,357
I just need you
to see something.

1185
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,624
Sorry to interrupt.

1186
01:12:43,626 --> 01:12:45,159
Did he say
what he wanted?

1187
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:46,794
I don't know.

1188
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,166
Fuck.

1189
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,706
Qadar. Qadar,
it's okay. You can go in.

1190
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,174
He just wants to talk to me.

1191
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:01,642
Okay. Okay.
It's okay.

1192
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:04,545
Oh, please, do not cover
your hair on my account.

1193
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:05,780
It's such beautiful hair.

1194
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,116
It's like the hide
of a fine horse.

1195
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:11,285
Sadiq, what are
you doing here?

1196
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:15,623
I was just going home
from closing a woman brothel

1197
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,058
when I told my driver,

1198
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,829
"mahboobullah, this is
where my best friend
Kimberly lives!"

1199
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:26,134
But she has been
a bad friend lately.

1200
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,003
She does not call.

1201
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:32,373
She does not
invite me to her party.

1202
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:33,207
I'm sorry,

1203
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:35,510
but I didn't think
the Attorney General

1204
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:37,779
of the islamic
Republic of Afghanistan

1205
01:13:37,781 --> 01:13:39,580
went to parties
at guesthouses.

1206
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,215
And why not?

1207
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:43,518
I am still a man, no?

1208
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,353
I love music.

1209
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:48,322
I love to dance!

1210
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,767
But

1211
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:03,337
even though
you have been
a bad friend,

1212
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,940
I want you to be happy.

1213
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,744
Do you have
a special friend?

1214
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,180
Because

1215
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:16,851
I would love to be
your special friend.

1216
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,954
Would you like that, Kim?

1217
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,325
You're a bad friend.

1218
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,294
You are a bad friend.

1219
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:30,765
In America, I would get
a book deal out of this shit!

1220
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,733
You can't just do this, okay?

1221
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:34,602
I haven't been on
the air in months!

1222
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:39,574
My best friend
here almost died,
and I am jealous of her!

1223
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:41,476
And I am just...

1224
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,879
Fuck this! All of it!

1225
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:10,438
That was a bomb.

1226
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:12,940
Hello! So, wait!

1227
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:15,543
Who is fronting the show?

1228
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:16,744
Tucker? No, I don't
know who that is.

1229
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:20,348
Okay, well, I could go
live for the overnights,
but this is...

1230
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:24,852
"Satellite time?"
No, I have a
dedicated feed.

1231
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,921
Since when?

1232
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:28,389
<i> This is Tucker wang.</i>

1233
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:29,056
This is Kim Baker.

1234
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:31,726
Why am I being told that
i don't have a sat hookup?

1235
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:33,761
<i> Because you're on</i>
<i> the hourly plan now.</i>

1236
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:35,863
<i> And either way,</i>
<i> the show is full tonight.</i>

1237
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:36,764
No. Who is your boss?

1238
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:38,933
I want to talk to
this Jerry whatever, Taub.

1239
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:41,602
<i> Okay, look, Jerry has</i>
<i> mentioned Afghanistan</i>
<i> to me once,</i>

1240
01:15:41,604 --> 01:15:43,604
<i> and mentioned it to know why</i>
<i> the only good story to come</i>

1241
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,573
<i> out of there in a year</i>
<i> was on another network.</i>

1242
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:48,209
What, Tanya's thing?
No, I've got shit like that.

1243
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,211
I'm waiting for
the snow to melt!

1244
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,012
I want to talk to Jerry.

1245
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:53,180
<i> If I could just get</i>
<i> you to get me a story</i>

1246
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:54,782
<i> that somebody</i>
<i> would care about,</i>

1247
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,551
<i> it would be fine.</i>
<i> But meanwhile...</i>

1248
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:57,351
Okay, what if i
come to New York

1249
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:59,487
and I burst into
Jerry's office?
How about that?

1250
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:01,689
<i> Well, that might look</i>
<i> like I hadn't done my job.</i>

1251
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:04,058
Perfect. See you Wednesday.

1252
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,259
Cunt.

1253
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,098
Kim.

1254
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,135
Kim, look at these dogs.

1255
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,337
How does this end?

1256
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:19,106
A bucket of cold water,
i suppose.

1257
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,377
No.

1258
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,413
Um...

1259
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,816
How does this

1260
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,319
end?

1261
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:36,591
Uh, I don't
really know, Kim.

1262
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:40,928
We grow old together?
Get a cottage in the country?

1263
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,563
Raise chickens?

1264
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:43,931
Eat scrambled eggs
off each other?

1265
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:47,168
Look, we're good, aren't we?
We'll always have Kabul.

1266
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,270
No, we won't.
We won't "always have" it

1267
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,771
because I have to go home.

1268
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:51,839
No, this is home.

1269
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:55,943
I have to go to
New York City
and justify my life

1270
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,745
to somebody named Jerry

1271
01:16:57,747 --> 01:17:00,848
before he takes
it all away, and I

1272
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:06,921
cannot go back to sitting
at a goddamn desk. I can't.

1273
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:08,422
Aye. Listen...

1274
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:11,158
No one can take
it away from you.

1275
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,993
Not all of it.

1276
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:14,462
Whatever happens,
you'll have me.

1277
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:18,399
That's a very nice
thing to say, but...

1278
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:19,867
But what?

1279
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:35,049
<i> Following</i>
<i> a fatal traffic accident</i>
<i> involving a coalition truck,</i>

1280
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:36,017
<i> long simmering frustration</i>

1281
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:40,221
<i> today boiled over</i>
<i> into violence and despair.</i>

1282
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,255
<i> They kill us!</i>

1283
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,057
<i> They kill us and</i>
<i> they break our hearts!</i>

1284
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:46,093
<i> And I also give this message</i>
<i> to president Hamid karzai:</i>

1285
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:49,430
<i> What the hell is</i>
<i> happening here?</i>

1286
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,519
Okay, I don't care
who the hell's in there.
I'm Kim Baker.

1287
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:14,088
Go on in, Kim.
Jerry's expecting you.

1288
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,957
Well, that's
fucking unsatisfying.

1289
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:18,492
Can I take your bag?

1290
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,161
Yes. Please.

1291
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,163
Would you care
for some water?

1292
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:23,464
Yes.

1293
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:34,742
I should've googled you.

1294
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:39,346
I've been... I've been
using all the wrong
swear words.

1295
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,782
Well, I hope
i didn't ruin
your big moment.

1296
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:44,318
Look, geri, I don't know what
Tucker has been telling you.

1297
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,221
He said that you're
upset about the air
time you're getting.

1298
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:50,858
That's just wrong,
because this is
not about me.

1299
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,060
My frustration is
with our priorities

1300
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,629
and what's best
for the network.

1301
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:59,166
Isn't deciding what's best
for the network my job?

1302
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:01,936
I'm just saying,

1303
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:04,405
as journalists, we have
an obligation to this story.

1304
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:08,309
And Afghanistan should be
on our air more, period.

1305
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:09,744
With the resources
we have over there,

1306
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:12,279
Afghanistan should
definitely be
on our air more.

1307
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:16,183
But the problem is,
as much as everyone
loves the troops,

1308
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:20,654
they don't actually
want to watch them
on the news anymore.

1309
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:21,689
They just don't.

1310
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:24,391
So I can't give
Afghanistan more air.

1311
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:28,662
Which means I need
to give Afghanistan
fewer resources.

1312
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:31,899
That's what's
best for the network.

1313
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:33,434
Geri...

1314
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:35,035
You have that call now.

1315
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,973
I'm not trying
to be a bitch.

1316
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:40,074
Okay, let me
pitch you something.

1317
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:42,009
All right, the Chinese
mining concession...

1318
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:42,443
Jesus!

1319
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,145
Look, the last person
who got any kind of

1320
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:45,513
bounce out of Afghanistan

1321
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:46,981
was your friend
Tanya vanderpoel.

1322
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:51,085
She's actually
got me over a barrel
thanks to that drone story.

1323
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:53,020
What do you mean,
"over a barrel"?

1324
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:54,789
She's London, Kim.

1325
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,492
You're hiring Tanya.
Yes.

1326
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,762
I assumed you two
flew here together.

1327
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:05,032
She's here.

1328
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:12,006
I'm sorry, you started
talking to her before
the uav strike?

1329
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:13,974
Is uav a drone?

1330
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,710
Hello! Where are you going?

1331
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:19,980
No, I'm only here
for a few days.

1332
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:21,982
Oh, I know.

1333
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:25,085
Oh, fuck.

1334
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,754
I don't know
what to say to you.

1335
01:20:26,756 --> 01:20:29,089
Ducky, I'm sorry.
I fucked up.

1336
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:30,391
Did you go to the tribals

1337
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:32,092
because you were in
a contract negotiation?

1338
01:20:32,094 --> 01:20:34,461
Dude, I'm not
stealing your job, okay?

1339
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:38,165
Tanya, this is not
about my fucking job.

1340
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,134
We have to make
good calls, right?

1341
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:43,070
And now Andy lost an eye
and jaweed is dead.

1342
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:45,372
Christ, man, we've both
fucking made mistakes!

1343
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:49,543
No. Tell me you
didn't go to the tribals
because of a contract.

1344
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:53,647
You would have done
exactly what I did
if jaweed had gone to you.

1345
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:55,683
No. I'm not you.

1346
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,225
Do you remember
your first embed?

1347
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:07,228
You interviewed
a young marine?

1348
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:07,928
Coughlin? Yes. What?

1349
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:11,165
Yeah, well, after they
aired your story,

1350
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:16,003
where you used
his soundbite about
not loading his rifle,

1351
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:18,539
they sent him to helmand.

1352
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:21,242
And he got
his legs blown off.

1353
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,544
So I hear.

1354
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,718
See you in Kabul.

1355
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:03,083
<i> I'm not really surprised</i>
<i> she chased the story.</i>

1356
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,452
That's what we do.
That's what you do.

1357
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:06,854
I would do it.

1358
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,991
Sorry.

1359
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:13,661
Goddamn it, I'm tired.

1360
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:14,561
You booked your return yet?

1361
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:16,897
'Cause you could come through
Glasgow if you wanted.

1362
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:17,998
<i> I'll meet you.</i>
What?

1363
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,767
No. What about badakhshan?

1364
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:21,035
Badakhshan, that will keep

1365
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:23,304
because the fucking pass
is still snowed in.

1366
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:26,473
I need that story.
I need a hit, all right?

1367
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:28,542
I need something
so that geri doesn't decide

1368
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,644
I'm more useful as
an ottoman in
her fucking office.

1369
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:33,681
What you need, Kim,
is some time
out of the bubble.

1370
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:36,684
<i> You'd better get ready.</i>
<i> I'm fucking</i>
<i> making love to you</i>

1371
01:22:36,686 --> 01:22:40,354
to bagpipe versions
of sade songs.

1372
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,157
Yeah, okay.

1373
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:45,659
Really? You'll meet
me in Glasgow?

1374
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,195
Yeah, I'll meet you
in Glasgow.

1375
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:50,564
<i> I'll get the next flight.</i>
Okay.

1376
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:53,033
Bye.
<i> Bye.</i>

1377
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:02,776
Hey, Antoine.

1378
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:06,613
Where have you come from?
I thought you
were in badakhshan.

1379
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:09,450
I was. Drove
back overnight.

1380
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:11,719
Wait, what?
The pass is open?

1381
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:13,988
<i> Oui.</i> For now.

1382
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,136
Cheers.

1383
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,925
Oh, Christ.

1384
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,511
Mmm-hmm.

1385
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:14,882
Aye, thank you.

1386
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:18,118
Yeah, I get it.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1387
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:44,078
Oh, Jesus.

1388
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,180
Oh, shit.

1389
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:57,658
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> Glasgow international airport.</i>

1390
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:00,761
<i> Outside temperature's</i>
<i> 18 degrees celsius.</i>

1391
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,429
<i> Local time is 15 hours.</i>

1392
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:05,766
<i> There will be</i>
<i> an airline representative</i>
<i> to assist you to your luggage.</i>

1393
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:08,902
<i> Once again, thank you</i>
<i> for flying with us...</i>

1394
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:11,772
Oh, my god.

1395
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:24,751
Leaving a message
for Susan.

1396
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:26,987
Woodward,
I'm back in Kabul again.

1397
01:25:26,989 --> 01:25:28,489
I'm trying to get
information about

1398
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:29,389
the disappearance
of iain mackelpie,

1399
01:25:29,391 --> 01:25:31,592
so if someone at reuters
can please call me back.

1400
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:34,261
Call to let me know
that you've
received this message.

1401
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:35,829
Thank you.

1402
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,847
Who kidnaps a Scottish
freelance photographer?

1403
01:25:53,849 --> 01:25:56,917
The whole point
of kidnapping is
to get money, right?

1404
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:57,651
As far as I understand,

1405
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,586
iain was just in
the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1406
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:02,422
Can this half-assed
country not even do
kidnapping right?

1407
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:05,459
Isaf does not think
this was an
upper-tier organization.

1408
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:08,562
So these men will
probably try to sell
him to someone else.

1409
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:11,965
And then there
will be some talking,
you know.

1410
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:15,135
Oh, my god, fahim.
They're gonna kill him.

1411
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,237
No, they will not, Kim,

1412
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:19,006
<i> inshallah.</i>

1413
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:24,545
Now is when you're supposed
to say "i told you so."

1414
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:35,589
Fuck!

1415
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:47,100
Ramadan has ended.
They are slaughtering lambs.

1416
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:07,821
May I speak with him?

1417
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:09,323
The general's busy.

1418
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,262
Really, general?
The elliptical?

1419
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,598
I have bad knees.

1420
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,502
I'm guessing you
didn't come here
for the smell of balls.

1421
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:25,072
Everybody get the fuck out!

1422
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:32,045
They believe that
he may have been sold

1423
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:33,513
to another organization

1424
01:27:33,515 --> 01:27:36,049
somewhere in
that same region.

1425
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:42,389
That's a pretty
big ask, Baker.

1426
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:46,159
There's a real-time
clock on this.

1427
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,696
I'm sorry,
i can't help you.

1428
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,806
You know,
it's just a shame that

1429
01:27:59,808 --> 01:28:01,775
y'all don't get
credit for all these

1430
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:03,277
high-profile
things that you do.

1431
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:06,013
You know, especially with
seals and delta out there.

1432
01:28:06,015 --> 01:28:07,547
I mean, what week
goes by that you don't see

1433
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:10,617
those assholes
on TV, am I right?

1434
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:14,388
And then next
time congress votes
on a Pentagon budget

1435
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:18,125
and there's this pesky little
10% line item for the marines,

1436
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:21,628
next thing you know,
you guys are just
part of the Navy.

1437
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,430
Although, sir,
you would look
spectacular

1438
01:28:23,432 --> 01:28:26,099
in one of those
pretty white uniforms.

1439
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,272
God, you know what?

1440
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,208
It's just occurring to me
that, unlike jsoc,

1441
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:36,977
you guys allow
reporter embeds.

1442
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:41,581
Which means that
a cameraman could go
on a forecon mission.

1443
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:45,719
Don't you think that would be
great for the corps, sir?

1444
01:28:45,721 --> 01:28:48,055
That kind of exposure?

1445
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:51,124
Pretty good for you, too.

1446
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,293
Look, we don't go in blind.

1447
01:28:53,295 --> 01:28:56,430
We have to know
what we're doing
and where we're going.

1448
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:57,564
It's the way we work.

1449
01:28:57,566 --> 01:29:00,500
We're not likely to
get an address, but...

1450
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,002
When you have
something concrete,

1451
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:04,137
come back and
we'll get kinetic.

1452
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:11,678
Ugh!

1453
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:17,617
Please tell Mr. sadiq
that his "special
friend" is here.

1454
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:20,020
What can I get
for you? Some tea?
The new PlayStation?

1455
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:24,091
No, thank you. I just need
a moment of your time.
Ah.

1456
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,728
We still friends, sadiq?

1457
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,997
Well, that is
up to you, Kim.

1458
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:32,399
Because you once told me

1459
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:35,569
that nothing happens here
that you don't know about.

1460
01:29:35,571 --> 01:29:37,738
So you must know
about my friend

1461
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,006
iain mackelpie
getting kidnapped.

1462
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:40,874
I did hear about this, yes.

1463
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:41,775
Yeah, well, everybody
heard about it,

1464
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:46,646
but a powerful man
such as yourself must
actually know something.

1465
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:49,282
Or your friend pacha Khan
knows something.

1466
01:29:49,284 --> 01:29:50,851
Or his friend does.

1467
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:51,218
Of course.

1468
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:54,921
I could make some inquiries,
but I can only do this

1469
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:57,657
for a very special friend.

1470
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:18,612
I have a video that I think
you should watch, sadiq.

1471
01:30:18,614 --> 01:30:21,748
You push the little triangle.

1472
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:25,252
You can watch
video on the phone?

1473
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:30,157
What is this?

1474
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:32,959
It looks like
the Attorney General

1475
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:35,262
of the islamic
Republic of Afghanistan

1476
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:36,496
dancing in the street

1477
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:38,799
with a western
enemy of islam

1478
01:30:38,801 --> 01:30:41,535
at a party where
alcohol was served.

1479
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,403
I've never touched
alcohol in my life!

1480
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:46,106
Well, I'm just saying
how it looks.

1481
01:30:53,515 --> 01:30:56,049
It's a good idea, right?

1482
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,885
It's a great idea!

1483
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,821
It's fucking Ace!

1484
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,058
Good on ya, Kim!

1485
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,163
Let's go, load up!
Let's go, move, move, move!

1486
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,979
You drink Tennessee whiskey,
miss Baker?

1487
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,148
Yeah.

1488
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:32,285
Outstanding.

1489
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:21,061
Tall Brian? What the fuck?

1490
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:35,875
Hang tight, sir.
I'm gonna get you
that ride.

1491
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:37,911
Thank you.

1492
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:44,784
What happened
to the army, Dr. brydon?

1493
01:33:47,356 --> 01:33:49,222
I am the army.

1494
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,662
Thank you, Kim.

1495
01:33:55,664 --> 01:33:57,197
How are you?

1496
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,999
I've had worse
kidnappings.

1497
01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:04,804
<i> Mackelpie is being</i>
<i> treated for minor injuries.</i>

1498
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:06,206
<i> Again, this incredible footage</i>

1499
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:08,441
<i> was produced</i>
<i> by our very own Kim Baker.</i>

1500
01:34:08,443 --> 01:34:11,478
<i> Just incredible.</i>
<i> Way to go, Kim!</i>

1501
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:15,882
If you want to kidnap
someone fucking twice,

1502
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:16,549
you do a Toyota.

1503
01:34:16,551 --> 01:34:18,418
Fucking not as
interesting as it got

1504
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,387
when they fucking
pulled out a burqa.

1505
01:34:20,389 --> 01:34:21,554
It's too fucking
long for me!

1506
01:34:21,556 --> 01:34:23,490
I don't know who
the woman was
it belonged to.

1507
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:25,158
I'm not fucking 6'2", right?

1508
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,793
I'm dragging this
fucking thing along,

1509
01:34:26,795 --> 01:34:28,294
thinking
the only consolation is,

1510
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:30,330
at least if I'm
a fucking woman,

1511
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:33,833
I'm not gonna get buggered,
you know what I'm saying?

1512
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:42,142
So anyway, I took
a little something,
actually.

1513
01:34:42,144 --> 01:34:44,010
I went to
the gift shop at Taliban.

1514
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,712
I'm afraid all I could get

1515
01:34:45,714 --> 01:34:47,514
was that.

1516
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:13,173
It's a shame you're going.
Hmm?

1517
01:35:13,175 --> 01:35:17,210
Well, I hope at least
they're flying you
first class.

1518
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:20,747
Geri doesn't
like me that much.
But she does like me now,

1519
01:35:20,749 --> 01:35:22,716
so while I have this juice,

1520
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,918
I've got to leverage it
into something better.

1521
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,386
Yes!

1522
01:35:26,388 --> 01:35:27,487
Yes, wait, Iraq.

1523
01:35:27,489 --> 01:35:28,555
I'll come with you.

1524
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:31,958
No, actually, Pakistan.
That's where
the real shooting shit is.

1525
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:32,892
It's like
the wild west out there.

1526
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:36,763
Actually, I told geri
that I want New York or D.C.

1527
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:43,436
No, I did.

1528
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:45,739
No, really,
where are you going?

1529
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:47,607
New York or D.C.

1530
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:50,810
Why?

1531
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:54,180
You can still come with me.

1532
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:02,088
Because I think
there's plenty of good work

1533
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,456
to be done in the real world,

1534
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,391
and the kabubble
is well-established.

1535
01:36:05,393 --> 01:36:08,061
Is this about me going
to badakhshan without you?

1536
01:36:08,063 --> 01:36:10,830
'Cause you would have done
exactly the same thing.

1537
01:36:10,832 --> 01:36:13,933
And, hey, what,
i forgive you!

1538
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:17,637
This is not about you.

1539
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:20,473
It's not about badakhshan,
or Glasgow,

1540
01:36:20,475 --> 01:36:23,109
or the cottage
with the chickens.

1541
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,378
What chickens?

1542
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:34,287
It's okay.
I know you're not gonna come.

1543
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:40,527
I just have to get out of here
before it's too late.

1544
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:43,496
What do you mean?

1545
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:47,767
I started to feel
like this was normal.

1546
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:52,672
You know it's not, right?

1547
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:11,658
Come to New York and get it.

1548
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:15,762
Remember, you're like
a six in Manhattan.

1549
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:50,363
How's your baby?

1550
01:37:50,831 --> 01:37:52,365
Which one?

1551
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:54,868
You have two?
Yes.

1552
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:58,872
Irish twins.

1553
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:02,542
No, they are very good.

1554
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:06,079
The younger one, the boy,
he's very strong.

1555
01:38:06,081 --> 01:38:07,347
Mmm.
Mmm.

1556
01:38:07,349 --> 01:38:09,782
I bet the girl
is strong, too.

1557
01:38:09,784 --> 01:38:11,484
She's stronger.

1558
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,515
So, um,

1559
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:46,486
those men in the hospital,
the addicts...

1560
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:49,856
Any of them ever get better?

1561
01:38:49,858 --> 01:38:52,992
Have a happy ending?

1562
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:07,607
In my culture, we would hug.

1563
01:40:32,259 --> 01:40:33,526
Hey.

1564
01:40:33,727 --> 01:40:36,629
<i> You know,</i>
<i> I miss it. The Stan.</i>

1565
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:38,031
Yeah, I miss it, too.

1566
01:40:38,033 --> 01:40:40,767
Actually, I tried to go back

1567
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:43,002
but even the army
wouldn't take me.

1568
01:40:43,004 --> 01:40:46,839
I mean, the army!
I mean, that's just hurtful.

1569
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:52,245
Well, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

1570
01:40:52,247 --> 01:40:55,748
So if there's anything
that you want to say to me,

1571
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:57,016
that's why I'm here.

1572
01:40:57,018 --> 01:40:59,218
That's why I came here.

1573
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:00,653
Ma'am,

1574
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:05,992
I lost my legs
because of an ied,
not because of you.

1575
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:09,429
I appreciate that,
but if I hadn't quoted you,

1576
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:11,998
you wouldn't have
been transferred.

1577
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,300
No, really, you can say
whatever you want to me.

1578
01:41:14,302 --> 01:41:14,901
That's why I'm here.

1579
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:16,402
Okay, well,
then let's say you're right.

1580
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,937
It's still not
'cause of you, ma'am.

1581
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:22,175
Some 12-year-old haji
had to plant that bomb.

1582
01:41:22,177 --> 01:41:25,278
And, hell, you know,
if bin laden's parents

1583
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,212
hadn't have gotten divorced,

1584
01:41:26,214 --> 01:41:30,249
maybe none of us would've been
in the Stan to begin with.

1585
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:34,554
And the Taliban, they wouldn't
have even been there for ubl

1586
01:41:34,556 --> 01:41:38,091
if brezhnev hadn't have gone
and fouled up Afghanistan

1587
01:41:38,093 --> 01:41:40,026
in the first place.

1588
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:44,230
And the British empire. Yeah.

1589
01:41:44,232 --> 01:41:45,364
And Kim Baker.

1590
01:41:45,366 --> 01:41:46,799
Okay, I deserve that.

1591
01:41:46,801 --> 01:41:52,572
Goddamn!
Once you got no legs, everyone takes everything so serious.

1592
01:41:53,108 --> 01:41:57,944
I mean, there's only
so much any of us
have any control of,

1593
01:41:58,278 --> 01:41:59,912
good or bad.

1594
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:03,816
If you didn't learn
that in Afghanistan, you
were not paying attention.

1595
01:42:03,818 --> 01:42:06,119
So, you're not
gonna yell at me?

1596
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:09,255
I mean, ma'am...

1597
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:12,792
Kim, you've got to move on.

1598
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:16,362
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

1599
01:42:16,597 --> 01:42:19,065
You embrace the suck,

1600
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:22,235
you move the fuck forward.

1601
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:30,576
What other fucking
choice do we have?

1602
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:35,648
Do I hear swearing
over there?

1603
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,618
How are you standing there
the one time I curse?

1604
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:39,318
"One time."
I mean...

1605
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,021
It's true. He had a good
long run in the military.

1606
01:42:42,023 --> 01:42:44,157
Don't cover up for him.

1607
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:45,825
So, Kim, are you
gonna stay for dinner?

1608
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:47,994
Of course she will.

1609
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:10,116
Bye!

1610
01:43:10,217 --> 01:43:14,187
Say bye to Kim. Bye, Kim!
Say bye.

1611
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,942
<i> Colonel, the Afghan</i>
<i> national army missed</i>

1612
01:43:35,944 --> 01:43:37,109
<i> yet another benchmark</i>

1613
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:39,979

1614
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:43,316

1630
01:44:11,879 --> 01:44:15,648

1631
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:18,217
