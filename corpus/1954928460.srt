1
00:00:05,598 --> 00:00:09,201
<i>Charlotte... there are things
you couldn't have known.</i>

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:13,238
<i>It would be difficult for you to grasp
the depths to which I had fallen,</i>

3
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:16,405
<i>or the guilt that plagued me,
without grasping the scale of this monster</i>

4
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,081
<i>called the East India Company.</i>

5
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:22,741
<i>In their greed and avarice,
they had flung their empire of destruction</i>

6
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:24,832
<i>around the globe.</i>

7
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:27,219
<i>In time, there was investigation,</i>

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,389
<i>and finally, there was this report.</i>

9
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,325
<i>It had a lot to say about Charles Kemp</i>

10
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:37,296
<i>and, I'm afraid,
made mention of me as well.</i>

11
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:41,700
<i>Delivering this report to you the moment
you are ready to receive me again</i>

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,620
<i>will be my last job.</i>

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,611
<i>I live only to be worthy
of your respect.</i>

14
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,734
Steady as she goes!

15
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:12,534
- Hold the course.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:25,768
Call the shot, Mr. Brand.

17
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,368
One last time.

18
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,320
Speed, three knots.

19
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,177
On my mark. Fire.

20
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,427
- <i>Gentlemen of the board.</i>
- Fire.

21
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:43,296
<i>It's good to be back in London.</i>

22
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:49,034
I am pleased to report that our operations
in India continue to be profitable.

23
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:54,706
And yet, I have a feeling that our
interests in the American colonies

24
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:59,579
could match or even exceed
our revenues from India.

25
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,414
<i>Provided, of course...</i>

26
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:07,472
<i>that we can keep Parliament
from meddling in our affairs.</i>

27
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:19,031
<i>Even as we meet,</i>

28
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:23,335
<i>my team is intercepting the final report
of Parliament's investigation</i>

29
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,205
<i>of our business practices in India.</i>

30
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:30,679
<i>My men are replacing
the official report with an altered copy</i>

31
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:35,447
<i>which, I can assure you, will read
quite differently from the original.</i>

32
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:36,749
- Oh! He's dead!
- Hey!

33
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,871
- Sound the alarm!
- Time to go!

34
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:58,103
<i>Gentlemen, I assure you,
you may trust in my discretion.</i>

35
00:02:58,203 --> 00:03:02,627
<i>Nothing, and no one
will stand in our way.</i>

36
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,420
William.

37
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,925
In the 14 years that I have known you,
you have never let me down.

38
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,268
Not once.

39
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,416
You are a treasure to me.

40
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,088
- Thank you, sir.
- What is this?

41
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,395
Oh, yes, very fine!

42
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:15,047
Very much like my own.

43
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:16,782
Yes.

44
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,017
So, then, you are what?

45
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:24,089
One week back in England, and already
carrying yourself like a gentleman.

46
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:28,176
Well, in as much as I'll have the title
and lands that you've promised me,

47
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,062
I thought I should make a start.

48
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,731
I hope I'm not too eager in following
in your footsteps.

49
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:37,188
Oh, my dear boy, have I... Have I not
impressed upon you the opportunities

50
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,294
that could await you in the Americas?

51
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:41,840
And think of it, that vast hinterland

52
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,743
and those 13 squabbling colonies,

53
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:46,912
all ripe for the picking.

54
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:50,516
- Have I not done all that you've asked?
- You have.

55
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:52,818
- All that was required.
- All.

56
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,620
I've made my fortune...

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,390
And you have made your fortune
doing exactly what I asked you to do.

58
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,160
And you are the man
that I need there in the Americas.

59
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,367
I'm done.

60
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,786
I'm ready to put this
behind me, as you did.

61
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:10,469
I will triple the offer
I have made to you.

62
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:13,839
Already the Company
owes me over £10,000.

63
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,228
And I have your promise of a new name.

64
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:18,816
My heart is set on other things.

65
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,823
You mean that?

66
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,522
Yes.

67
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:34,299
It's set. 10-second timer
once you pull the cord.

68
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,319
You heard what he said.
10 seconds. Don't waste it.

69
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,344
And make sure he's dead
before you jump. Go.

70
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,488
Good luck, Will. Safe travels.

71
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:13,655
Driver! Hey! Wait!

72
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:15,567
Stop your carriage!

73
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:19,711
Driver! Hey!

74
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:24,583
Wait! Your carriage is on fire!

75
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:34,225
<i>In that moment, I knew my guilt
had come to pay me out.</i>

76
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,472
Give me your hand! Jump!

77
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,305
- Get back!
- Now!

78
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:05,070
On him... will fall the full burden

79
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,905
<i>of the accusations.</i>

80
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:11,327
<i>All of the vilifications that will
have been aimed at the company.</i>

81
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:16,314
Tomorrow, in your newspapers,
gentlemen, you will be shocked

82
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:19,351
<i>to learn of the rogue activities</i>

83
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:23,021
<i>of that infamous scoundrel,</i>

84
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,278
<i>the late William Reynolds.</i>

85
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:01,680
Sorry about that.

86
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:15,060
You would be a vicar.

87
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:19,477
<i>I had wanted a new name.</i>

88
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,633
<i>Now, I had it.</i>

89
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,709
<i>This wasn't my idea, but...</i>

90
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,751
<i>there was a sense of divine justice,</i>

91
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:29,788
<i>that an assassin like me
should be forced to live</i>

92
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:32,143
<i>a vicar's life.</i>

93
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,960
By my word.

94
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,616
I will avenge us both for this.

95
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:28,178
Sir?

96
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:33,672
Oh, Lord.

97
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:41,630
Brent! Wake Jeremiah!

98
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:49,240
Sir. Sir.

99
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,159
I do hope he hasn't contracted
any of those lake diseases.

100
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,730
- Indeed, Mrs. Witherspoon.
- I understand they're quite dreadful.

101
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,687
- Will he recover, Doctor?
- I think so, Mrs. Holloway.

102
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:08,540
Oh, I hope it's not going
to hinder his preaching.

103
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,996
Anything would be better though
than the last vicar.

104
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,982
He faithfully preached
the worst sermons I have ever heard.

105
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:22,407
- Give him rest and quiet.
- Thank you.

106
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:12,303
Reverend?

107
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,904
It's good to see you awake.

108
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,243
The newspapers are full of your story.

109
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:21,877
Apparently, you were the last victim of
a rogue who did terrible things in India.

110
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,649
His name was William Reynolds.

111
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:29,073
Seemed to be a very brutal man.
A miracle that you survived.

112
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:46,708
<i>Becoming a vicar hadn't turned out
so bad after all.</i>

113
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:50,094
<i>You had believed my story, and...</i>

114
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:53,231
<i>now Reynolds was dead.</i>

115
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,796
<i>There was an untouched innocence
and a beauty about the place</i>

116
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:01,139
<i>that was very attractive.</i>

117
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:07,292
- The kitchen's well stocked...
- <i>I reasoned that my revenge could wait...</i>

118
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:10,474
<i>while I explored
where this path might lead.</i>

119
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,291
That tattoo.

120
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:23,408
East India Company?

121
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,677
I've seen it before.

122
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,699
On slave traders, mainly.

123
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,403
Mrs. Holloway knows.

124
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:37,409
A friend contacted a family for me
after Mr. Holloway died.

125
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,445
I needed out.

126
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,281
And they needed me.

127
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:47,165
The whole town is talking
about your arrival.

128
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:52,170
We should hurry on over to the church
or we'll be late for your first sermon.

129
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,665
My sermon?

130
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,495
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

131
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:00,498
- Good morning.
- Today's homily is...

132
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:10,108
Near, and... dear,

133
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:14,245
to, I am sure, many of you.

134
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,891
Let's all stand.

135
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,273
Thank you. You may be seated.

136
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,695
I apologize. I...

137
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,918
can't read my own writing sometimes.

138
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:13,205
Burn it! Burn it all!

139
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,952
Come on, Will.

140
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,508
Pull yourself together.

141
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,944
Reverend.

142
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,080
Are you well?

143
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:01,132
Yes. Why are you here?

144
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:05,603
My mother asked me
to make sure you come to supper.

145
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:08,006
She had her doubts you would.

146
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,174
Will you join us?

147
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:13,341
Yes. Yes, of course I will.

148
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:24,261
<i>And so, the days stretched into weeks.</i>

149
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,358
<i>When I was with you, Charlotte,</i>

150
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,635
<i>the darkness seemed further away.</i>

151
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,971
We're all very fond of you,
as I hope you know.

152
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:00,858
"We"?

153
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,963
Oh, yes, my mother is happy
that you're here.

154
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:07,471
Yes, I see.

155
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,308
And you?

156
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:15,607
Who else would be my walking companion?

157
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:19,210
So, you saved me from drowning
to be your walking companion?

158
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,479
Why else?

159
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,564
Because you're kind.

160
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:28,954
- You're compassionate, you're virtuous...
- Stop. Please, I do not deserve such talk.

161
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:33,364
Charlotte, I feel as if I...
I have a new life here.

162
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,617
It's a life you made possible.

163
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,804
Only God can give us new lives.

164
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:44,141
God did not drag me from this pond.

165
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,688
How can we know the ways of God?

166
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,810
Five minutes sooner
or five minutes later,

167
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,387
everything might have been different.

168
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,356
That is the mystery of it.

169
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,259
What do you feel, Mr. Walters?

170
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:08,232
I feel as if I can trust you
with my life.

171
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:12,404
I've never felt such a thing before.

172
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:17,468
If that is providence, or fate,

173
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:21,572
whatever you would call it, then...
then I will accept it.

174
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,381
"If"?

175
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:30,541
What am I to think of a vicar who seems
so unsure of what he believes?

176
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:33,584
Charlotte, I'm...
I'm speaking to you truthfully.

177
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,760
From my heart.

178
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,535
Oh, this is terribly confusing.

179
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:49,834
Steven, I have an uncle
who is coming at Christmas.

180
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:54,181
He's traveling to America
and he's invited me to go with him.

181
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,323
And you've agreed?

182
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,627
Well, I'm hard pressed to say no.

183
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,847
My mother believes it'll be
a great experience for me.

184
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:05,722
But to leave Adlesbury...

185
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,993
What reason do I have to stay?

186
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,733
Would you like me to give you a reason?

187
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,850
Only if it is a good one.

188
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:28,346
Charlotte! Blast the devil's luck.

189
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,750
I'm sorry, I didn't know
if you could swim!

190
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,788
Thank you! I can't!

191
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:46,917
You're soaking! Let me walk you home.

192
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:50,225
Yes! I think that would be a good idea.

193
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,762
Good evening, Reverend.

194
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,318
Or is it... "parson"?

195
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,721
I get them confused.

196
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,560
Come to the fire where I can see you.

197
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:22,933
So, he sent you for me.

198
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,797
No.

199
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,767
We thought you were dead.

200
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:33,775
So imagine my surprise when I found you
back from the dead.

201
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:37,482
See, you have put me
in an awkward position, Will.

202
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:43,588
I do have my allegiance
with Charles Kemp to consider.

203
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,758
So, what are you offering?

204
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:50,955
I do have a few items that...

205
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,391
could destroy him...

206
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,793
- if in the right hands.
- I'm listening.

207
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:59,168
I have the Parliamentary Report
from Rajid.

208
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,466
Not the one Kemp doctored,
but the real one.

209
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:06,037
With all the names, dates,
financial transactions, it's all there.

210
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:10,881
So, you negotiate the deal with him,
and I'll split the amount with you.

211
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,849
Well, this is remarkable. I assumed a man
of the cloth would use a report like that

212
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:22,797
to expose the evil wrought by Mr. Kemp.

213
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:27,825
But you aren't a man of the cloth,
are you, Will?

214
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:29,694
I have found a new life.

215
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,129
A vicar?

216
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:34,477
Isn't that an absurd mask
for you to wear?

217
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,422
What if it's not a mask?

218
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:44,162
So, you have told her who you are.

219
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,383
Why don't you?

220
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,788
And see what the lady
thinks of you then.

221
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,194
Your hands are stained with blood.

222
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:01,065
I'm asking you...

223
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,435
please...

224
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:07,771
take the report...

225
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:09,767
and leave.

226
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,676
I will.

227
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:14,371
Along with your carcass...

228
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:16,808
and whatever reward he gives me.

229
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:20,544
Hell's been waiting
a very long time for you,

230
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,287
Will Reynolds.

231
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:00,007
You think you're better than me?

232
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,791
<i>Mother.</i>

233
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:44,168
<i>How did you know
that Father was the right one?</i>

234
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:48,138
Why do you ask?

235
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:57,328
Is this about our vicar?

236
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,681
You've grown very fond of him, I know.

237
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,085
He is a gentleman.

238
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:11,294
And... intelligent and...

239
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:16,602
enjoyable in conversation.
So full of surprises.

240
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:21,522
Do you love him?

241
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:23,734
I could...

242
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,643
I might.

243
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:30,815
But there is something
that beguiles me about him.

244
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,919
When I wish with all my heart
that we would move forward...

245
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,988
<i>I stop.</i>

246
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:42,920
<i>All of his good words...</i>

247
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,129
<i>there's something missing.</i>

248
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:50,327
<i>Because sometimes he speaks of God
as a distant acquaintance,</i>

249
00:23:50,427 --> 00:23:52,903
<i>not as an intimate friend.</i>

250
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,734
It's times like these I...

251
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,507
I do miss Father terribly.

252
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:12,616
You could speak with your uncle
when he comes at Christmas.

253
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:14,686
Can't you wait until then?

254
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,021
There's no reason to rush.

255
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:20,283
I simply cannot make a decision
about America without...

256
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:22,794
resolving my feelings for Steven first.

257
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:27,371
<i>But you aren't a man
of the cloth, are you, Will?</i>

258
00:24:28,198 --> 00:24:31,268
<i>You are the same man you've always been.</i>

259
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:34,153
<i>Your hands are stained with...</i>

260
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:45,376
Please. Please show me what I must do.

261
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:10,147
- Charlotte.
- Is everything all right?

262
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:13,578
No.

263
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:16,080
It's not all right.

264
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:20,925
There are things about me that...

265
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:27,598
I'm not the man that...

266
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:31,336
That is to say that in my past, I...

267
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,505
Before I came to Adlesbury...

268
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,398
I was not trained as a vicar.

269
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:44,223
The quality of your training
has been a question.

270
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:48,385
What I mean to say, though, is...

271
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:53,056
I'm not worthy of you.

272
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,093
I know of no man who is.

273
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:02,232
Certainly, you deserve better
than anything that I can...

274
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,338
I'm not a good man.

275
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:11,208
But I decided to be.

276
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:15,712
The thought of losing you,
it's more than I can bear.

277
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,483
You embody God's mercy for me.

278
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:24,803
It's a mercy that I'm beginning
to appreciate, though...

279
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:26,728
I don't deserve it.

280
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:30,598
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

281
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,369
please don't go to America.

282
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,733
I don't want to be separated from you.

283
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,738
Ms. Charlotte Holloway, I...

284
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:50,829
Will you consent to be my wife?

285
00:26:54,645 --> 00:26:57,939
- Mr. Walters...
- Please don't... Don't call me that.

286
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,540
I'm sorry. Steven.

287
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,478
I... I cannot.

288
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:09,293
But... that is to say, I...

289
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:12,603
I cannot give you an answer yet.

290
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,435
Not because I do not wish to say yes,

291
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:20,877
because I do.

292
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,974
But I don't...

293
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,977
fully trust myself...

294
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:29,654
to make a decision
of this importance alone.

295
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:34,992
Charlotte, I... I will do anything.

296
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:39,864
Will you meet my uncle at Christmas?

297
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:44,368
Yes. Yes, of course.

298
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,838
I would like that.

299
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:56,446
With his approval,

300
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,716
I will be most happy to agree.

301
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:03,954
Thank you. Thank you. I...

302
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,390
I am honored.

303
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:09,793
Thank you, Steven.

304
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,525
Good night, Ms. Charlotte.

305
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,500
Good night.

306
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:06,360
Steven! Are you coming along?

307
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,312
Yes, of course.

308
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,680
My uncle can hardly wait to see you.

309
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,450
Now? Before the service?

310
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:18,879
- Would you rather we wait?
- No. No, now will do.

311
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:21,776
Thank you! Uncle!

312
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:27,798
Steven, this is my Uncle Charles.

313
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:30,775
Uncle Charles, Steven Walters.

314
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:42,446
Charlotte, my dear,
would you mind leaving us?

315
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:45,789
We... we need to talk man-to-man.

316
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:48,125
I'll wait.

317
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:13,244
- You astonish me, Will.
- Then we are in good company.

318
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:17,520
Oi! Form up! We're needed at the church.

319
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:31,295
You are no man of peace! Or is this a...

320
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,897
Not my niece!

321
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:36,647
Good heavens, man, do you really think
that you can have a life...

322
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:40,120
Charles, I beg of you.
If only for the sake of old loyalties,

323
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,314
- my service to you in India, all I have...
- She's not your sort!

324
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:47,918
She is a good person.

325
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:54,525
Would she be surprised if I showed her the
uncorrected Parliamentary Report I possess?

326
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:01,491
You threaten me, you dog?

327
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:05,001
Steven, Uncle Charles, Mother's worried.

328
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:08,071
What's the matter?

329
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:24,255
Charlotte, my dear,
it grieves me that this scoundrel

330
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:27,617
has lied his way into your affections.

331
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:28,886
What?

332
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:31,822
Our paths have crossed before in India!

333
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,858
- Charlotte, I can explain.
- He is a liar...

334
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:38,528
- And I have changed because of you.
- He is an impostor...

335
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:41,759
- And he is a murderer.
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.

336
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,568
I told you, Reverend Walters
had a past you didn't know of.

337
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:48,656
But you are neither Reverend
nor are you Walters.

338
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:52,409
You are the infamous scoundrel...

339
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,546
- William Reynolds!
- Charlotte, please.

340
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:57,447
- Guards!
- I can explain!

341
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:59,917
- Come, my dear. Come. Guards, quickly!
- Open this door!

342
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,348
- Come on!
- Steven!

343
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:03,727
- This is not who I am!
- No! Wait!

344
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:31,649
Hey! There he is!

345
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,284
Move along!

346
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,725
Get out of the way!

347
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,042
Let's go! Yeah!

348
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:11,294
Should we pursue?

349
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:15,832
No need. I have something that he wants.

350
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,635
He will come to me.

351
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,301
How did you know I needed help?

352
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,388
East India Company.

353
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:41,809
When I stayed with their horses, I...

354
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:44,761
I saw their weapons and I knew.

355
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:50,700
I grabbed these for you.

356
00:33:56,232 --> 00:33:58,575
Escape while you can.

357
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:02,974
You can't undo the damage done.

358
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,315
No.

359
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,351
I have to.

360
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,055
He's taken everything from me.

361
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,331
Ms. Charlotte will not be moved
by revenge.

362
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,939
I'm so sorry...

363
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:32,742
You shouldn't have saved me.

364
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:36,905
My life wasn't worth your sacrifice.

365
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,312
Redemption,

366
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,888
not revenge.

367
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:51,254
There's only one man with the power

368
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:53,563
to make you new.

369
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,897
God...

370
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:32,536
if you'll help me redeem my name,

371
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:38,708
I will lay aside revenge.

372
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:47,050
Let me show Charlotte that I can change.

373
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:52,356
Because of her.

374
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:59,554
I'm so sorry, Charlotte,
but William is dead.

375
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,743
- It's not here.
- Keep searching.

376
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:42,168
<i>Charlotte, your uncle's evil
made me into William Reynolds.</i>

377
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:48,114
<i>But now,</i> <i>he will be my opportunity.</i>

378
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:51,448
<i>I will prove to you
that I am a different man.</i>

379
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:58,182
<i>I will dismantle his plans
piece by piece.</i>

380
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,187
<i>I will create a new reputation
honorable enough...</i>

381
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:06,863
<i>to save me from my past.</i>

382
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:27,143
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes, please.

383
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:30,847
I'm looking for... Benjamin Franklin.

384
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:34,725
If you're looking for Mr. Franklin,
you'll find him at the shop.

385
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,726
Occasional incompetence
may be overlooked,

386
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:04,681
but yours persists at a level
worthy of Parliament.

387
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:07,957
No, my good man, my decision is final.

388
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:10,240
I must let you go.

389
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,897
- Good day, sir.
- And good day to you, sir.

390
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:16,760
And don't be a stranger...

391
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,061
to other establishments in town.

392
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,194
You're Mr. Franklin?

393
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:29,806
Well, now that depends.
Do I owe you money?

394
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:32,775
Have I offended a woman
of your acquaintance?

395
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,444
No.

396
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:37,047
Then, I am Benjamin Franklin.

397
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:40,751
- How may I be of service?
- Sir, I seek employment.

398
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,353
I'm retired.

399
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:45,562
Are you skilled as a printer?

400
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:48,180
I'm a fast learner.

401
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,102
Another! All of our fast learners
have been fast leaving.

402
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:56,199
Tell me, do you favor the King...

403
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:00,003
or alternatives yet to be explored?

404
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:04,207
On having only just arrived in this country,
I suppose I'm in favor of myself.

405
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:06,242
What others do is not my business.

406
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:09,079
Smart man!

407
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,414
But with no conviction.

408
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:16,493
Such a shame. But... anyone
can remake themselves here.

409
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:19,094
Even young men with no conviction.

410
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:21,072
So I've heard.

411
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:25,762
Every man must be tested
before he can be trusted.

412
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,132
Have you eaten?

413
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,040
No, sir.

414
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:36,506
The King and Crown pub.

415
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:39,829
You'll find no better meal
nor a better place to...

416
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:44,214
find out what convictions
you may or may not have.

417
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:47,684
Try the lamb. It is excellent.

418
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:50,654
Thank you, sir.
You're very kind, Mr. Franklin.

419
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:53,196
You're very welcome, Mister...

420
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:57,233
Flack. Jeremiah Flack.

421
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:08,671
I reckon he stays.

422
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:12,863
No, I give him five minutes.
Mark my time.

423
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:19,589
So I called him a rebel dog
and kicked him out of my shop.

424
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:26,863
Hear, hear. Long live the King.

425
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:41,944
Ale, please. Your place comes
recommended. Mr. Charles Kemp.

426
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:46,142
You're a disaster.

427
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:48,685
Franklin rejected you as well.

428
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:55,719
That nest... is ripe for kindling?

429
00:40:56,419 --> 00:41:00,556
I've never seen you here before.
You with Harrison's men?

430
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:02,525
Harrison?

431
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,001
That thundering cur?

432
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:07,770
I wouldn't leave him my scraps.

433
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:10,834
He remains loyal to our King.

434
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,036
Hush, hush!

435
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:15,863
And to his lying father, the devil.

436
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,142
A grown child should have
independence from its mother.

437
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:23,907
And for that mother to hold its child,
against its conscience, against its will,

438
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:25,855
is that not tyranny?

439
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,295
Beware, sir.

440
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:33,089
This is a loyal pub!

441
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:36,233
- God save the King!
- God save the King!

442
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:40,235
For loyal pups.

443
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:56,085
Did you have the lamb?

444
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:03,553
Pity. What happened, my boy?

445
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:06,856
Well, it seems I spoke up
for liberty and...

446
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:09,192
was thrown out on my conviction.

447
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:11,701
You are a fast learner.

448
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:17,440
- But have I the makings of a printer?
- Probably not.

449
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:23,039
But I'm retired, Mr. Flack.

450
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:27,710
That is, until I return from my duties
with the Continental Congress.

451
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,253
If I should survive that.

452
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:33,283
Are you in danger, sir?

453
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:36,953
Why, Mr. Flack, I am always in danger.

454
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:41,925
He that would give up a little liberty
for security, deserves neither

455
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:44,301
and loses both.

456
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:16,390
Charlotte, my dear,
you're looking unhappy.

457
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,995
I am sorry.

458
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:22,231
But, my dear, this is
an important social occasion.

459
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:25,898
We're trying to establish ourselves
in the very best circles. So smile!

460
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:28,638
Yes. Yes, of course.

461
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:32,108
- You may depend on me.
- Good girl.

462
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:36,012
- Yes?
- Factory shop, it's burning.

463
00:43:36,112 --> 00:43:37,614
Oh, no!

464
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:40,650
- Send all the men we can spare.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,751
My dear... my dear, I think...

466
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:47,523
perhaps it's time for you to withdraw
with the other ladies. Yes?

467
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:49,232
Yes.

468
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:17,960
This looks familiar.

469
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,257
Mr. Flack?

470
00:44:21,357 --> 00:44:23,466
What have you found?

471
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:27,503
A Leyden charge jar.

472
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:32,702
- You know it?
- It stores an electrical pulse.

473
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:37,039
I believe the Europeans came up with it
as a sort of parlor trick.

474
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:39,248
To shock women.

475
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:42,318
Or to detonate a bomb.

476
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:45,988
How do you know about that?

477
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:48,691
I'm a fast learner.

478
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:55,156
I thought I was the only man in the colonies
capable of creating such a device.

479
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:58,828
Now, these jars
don't work by themselves.

480
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:03,439
One needs a generator to charge them.
I've built one myself.

481
00:45:11,173 --> 00:45:13,349
Most impressive, sir.

482
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,933
Let me demonstrate for you.

483
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:23,930
Who created that bomb?

484
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:27,063
I don't know...

485
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,949
for certain.

486
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:54,017
Doctor!

487
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:59,288
My dear fellow, I want to congratulate you.
What a superb job you have done.

488
00:45:59,388 --> 00:46:03,459
Pleasure to serve, sir. Pleasure, indeed.
Would you like to see the chamber?

489
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:06,368
- I...
- Mr. Harrison is here.

490
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:11,093
Mr. Harrison and gentlemen, welcome.

491
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:13,402
Welcome, indeed.

492
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:16,411
- Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

493
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:20,739
- What goes on here?
- All in good time, sir.

494
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,262
Gentlemen...

495
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:28,417
my men and I
are loyal servants of the King.

496
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:34,590
We fear the consequences
that may come to these 13 colonies...

497
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,927
should these rascals succeed

498
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:42,179
in unifying their Continental Congress.

499
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:45,502
But, gentlemen, I have a plan.

500
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:49,171
When they speak
with their treacherous tongues,

501
00:46:49,271 --> 00:46:53,776
we shall reply with loyal fists.

502
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:56,879
You will have to recruit

503
00:46:56,979 --> 00:47:00,316
or to destroy those around you.

504
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:03,786
I look at you now and I ask,
are you willing?

505
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:05,955
- Yeah!
- Are you willing?

506
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:07,723
Yeah!

507
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:11,433
Go, sirs. Go all of you...

508
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:14,403
and create havoc.

509
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:23,946
That's quite a lot of work
for a mere cover.

510
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:28,144
This is not India.

511
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:31,212
And the cover is half the plan.

512
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:46,629
- Get this job done.
- Careful, that's a lot of rebel gunpowder.

513
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:49,672
- I'm trying.
- Just load it on the cart.

514
00:47:55,604 --> 00:47:57,646
What was that?

515
00:48:02,641 --> 00:48:04,720
Where are they?

516
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:07,753
Maybe loosen this cover.

517
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:33,377
Stop him!

518
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:38,014
If he is thwarting loyalists
and scoundrels,

519
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:41,150
this is the best news
in a very long time.

520
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,486
Well, then, what shall
we call him in our newspaper?

521
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:48,691
Masked man... mysterious vigilante?

522
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,768
Call him of what he his. The Highwayman.

523
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:18,861
You were right, sir. He did follow us.

524
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:22,365
In a mask, was he?

525
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,862
Now we can make of that what we will.

526
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:04,133
Astonishing.

527
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:08,370
The Highwayman runs rings around us.

528
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,240
Now how does he know our every move?

529
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,377
Are we compromised? Are your men loyal?

530
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:18,257
- Yes, sir, they are loyal.
- Get out of my sight.

531
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:24,868
I'm surrounded by fools.

532
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:34,122
I will not be made a fool of.

533
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:47,441
There's sort of...
strange events going on.

534
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,346
Is that not right? You have been talking
about this masked highwayman.

535
00:50:50,446 --> 00:50:52,248
Please, Ms. Charlotte.

536
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:55,297
Some discussions are best held
after small ears have been put to bed.

537
00:50:55,397 --> 00:50:57,103
Of course. I understand.

538
00:50:57,223 --> 00:51:00,690
But we look forward to hearing
your perspective. This is the new...

539
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,000
Daniel. Daniel Johnson.

540
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:15,378
Let her go! Sweetheart.

541
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:29,124
Daniel Johnson is a treasonous
rabble rouser.

542
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:33,229
Let this be a lesson to him
and to all who would defy the King.

543
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:41,071
Bring out the tar, men.

544
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:49,405
No!

545
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:52,566
Come on, boys. Let's get this job done.

546
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:40,389
- This is your uncle's doing.
- It's the Night Watch. Scatter!

547
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:43,192
- Everyone, stop.
- Stand down.

548
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:47,997
- Stop or we'll shoot.
- I will not be taken. Give me the child.

549
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:50,038
No!

550
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:52,708
No!

551
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,947
- He's taking my child!
- Hold your fire!

552
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:04,019
Lieutenant, catch that horse.
Everyone else, with me.

553
00:53:10,352 --> 00:53:11,727
Fire!

554
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:33,876
There!

555
00:53:33,976 --> 00:53:35,617
Fire!

556
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,338
Excuse me, sir.

557
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:34,169
Have you already published the events
on the Johnson house?

558
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:36,472
No, ma'am. We haven't.

559
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:39,078
I was there if you care to hear
a first-hand account.

560
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:41,510
I've written out the details.

561
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:45,014
The Highwayman, as you call him,
saved our lives,

562
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:47,907
in spite of what you may have heard
from the watchmen who were...

563
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:49,952
obviously confused about the event.

564
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:52,387
There's quite a bit of that
going around, actually.

565
00:54:52,487 --> 00:54:54,329
Jeremiah!

566
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:57,159
Mr. Flack, your hammer.

567
00:54:57,259 --> 00:54:59,567
Did you say Jeremiah Flack?

568
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:04,206
Yes, ma'am. Actually, he's right...

569
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:09,277
Now, that's odd. He was just right there.
Would you like me to find him for you?

570
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:12,241
No. No.

571
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:16,245
It is curious, though, I had a servant
by that name in England.

572
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:18,180
You don't say.

573
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,983
I will leave this account with you.

574
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,619
The Highwayman is a true hero.

575
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:26,929
The man behind the mask
deserves our deepest admiration.

576
00:55:27,489 --> 00:55:30,594
Indeed. Good day, ma'am.

577
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:46,277
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

578
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:02,831
<i>What of the missing papers?</i>

579
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:05,134
<i>The papers.</i>

580
00:56:06,662 --> 00:56:09,185
<i>I followed your instructions.</i>

581
00:56:19,741 --> 00:56:21,374
You were actually there?

582
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:25,114
- At the house of a well-known rebel?
- It was a friendly visit. You...

583
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:28,451
And you proclaimed
the Highwayman a hero?

584
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:31,787
- Yes. If you had been there...
- Have you any idea of the difficulties

585
00:56:31,887 --> 00:56:35,150
that I've had trying
to re-establish us in good society

586
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:39,191
after your recent disastrous engagement.

587
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:49,886
It was one dinner with a very...
polite family.

588
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:53,375
A polite family. They are rebels.

589
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:57,853
They are traitors and haven't you seen
the chaos they've been creating.

590
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:06,128
Yes, I imagine that violence
reminds you of India.

591
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:09,298
Is that not how it was there?

592
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,300
Charlotte, I think you should
confine yourself to the house

593
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,442
for the next few days.

594
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:23,812
These are dangerous times.

595
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,416
And I do not want your life jeopardized.

596
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:48,162
Thank you for meeting me.

597
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:53,034
It's an honor.

598
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:59,501
I wanted to thank you
for intervening that night.

599
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:01,910
And for warning me.

600
00:59:02,638 --> 00:59:06,709
We're all very grateful for your efforts
to stand between the innocent people

601
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:10,485
and those who wish
to commit violence against them.

602
00:59:12,147 --> 00:59:14,416
Do you include your uncle
in that statement?

603
00:59:15,951 --> 00:59:18,660
So you said he was the cause
of what happened.

604
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:21,497
I've not wanted to believe you.

605
00:59:22,324 --> 00:59:25,384
Yet I saw him meet with one
of the instigators of that violence.

606
00:59:27,863 --> 00:59:31,940
- What am I to do?
- There's nothing you can do.

607
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,810
- For now.
- Then why are you here?

608
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:38,179
To warn you.

609
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:41,176
The annual mayor's ball in New York.

610
00:59:41,576 --> 00:59:44,146
Your uncle has plans for that event.

611
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:46,315
And so do I.

612
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:50,091
In the end, the truth will win out.

613
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:53,996
- I have evidence.
- Evidence?

614
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:59,134
If that's true, why wait until then?
What stays your hand?

615
01:00:01,062 --> 01:00:03,004
Ms. Holloway...

616
01:00:03,732 --> 01:00:06,274
do you believe in redemption?

617
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:08,776
Can a man...

618
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:11,813
who has made his life a web of lies...

619
01:00:12,874 --> 01:00:15,116
earn trust again?

620
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:20,075
Well, that is a difficult question.

621
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:23,681
Of course, I believe in forgiveness.

622
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:27,714
It helps if... that man is willing...

623
01:00:27,814 --> 01:00:30,554
to set aside his deception.

624
01:00:34,196 --> 01:00:37,505
- I'm sorry. Someone's coming.
- Charlotte.

625
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:50,579
You knew a man once...

626
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:54,789
who was charged with many crimes
he did not commit.

627
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:58,320
And the crimes he did commit...

628
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,829
are a heavy burden upon him still.

629
01:01:01,756 --> 01:01:05,500
- Will...
- He had much to repay.

630
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,015
I lied to you.

631
01:01:22,644 --> 01:01:25,213
I lied to you about many things,

632
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:28,377
but I never lied to you about us.

633
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:37,866
<i>I never thought I'd see you again.</i>

634
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:43,404
William, what's happening?
I don't understand.

635
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,508
I love you.

636
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,839
And I wanted you to know.

637
01:01:50,939 --> 01:01:53,208
You of all people.

638
01:01:54,075 --> 01:01:56,578
- That William Reynolds...
- Charlotte.

639
01:01:56,678 --> 01:01:58,414
- I must go.
- No.

640
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,288
Charlotte.

641
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:07,929
There you are.
I thought you had retired.

642
01:02:08,806 --> 01:02:10,848
Was there someone...

643
01:02:11,593 --> 01:02:13,762
Anyway, there was something
I've got to tell you.

644
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:18,667
Once a year in New York,
they throw a masquerade ball.

645
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:21,042
Everyone attends.

646
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:26,090
I was wondering whether you would care
to accompany your old uncle.

647
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:31,245
My apologies.

648
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:51,593
May I have this dance?

649
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:53,535
Why, hardly.

650
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:56,798
Duke of Kent's Waltz, do you know it?

651
01:03:56,898 --> 01:04:00,408
- No.
- Then follow my lead.

652
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:12,620
You look lovely this evening.

653
01:04:13,565 --> 01:04:16,858
Making it difficult for me to keep
my eyes on General Washington.

654
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,529
Why are you watching General Washington?

655
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:27,195
My uncle wouldn't dare do anything
to harm the General.

656
01:04:27,295 --> 01:04:29,497
Not in front of so many witnesses.

657
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:33,675
Are you so certain?
He has used bombs before.

658
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,310
I may need to call upon you to
corroborate me before the night is over.

659
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,419
William, I need to know
that I can trust you.

660
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:50,314
You can, my dear. I will show you.

661
01:04:54,222 --> 01:04:57,542
Promise me... whatever happens,

662
01:04:57,642 --> 01:05:01,870
you will tell the truth.
Please, no more lies.

663
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,296
Yes, Charlotte.

664
01:05:04,396 --> 01:05:06,395
I promise.

665
01:05:07,502 --> 01:05:09,311
No more.

666
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:19,220
He's here. And he's wearing the jacket.

667
01:05:29,908 --> 01:05:32,524
Might I bother you to spend...

668
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:41,209
I must go.

669
01:06:08,797 --> 01:06:11,519
- He attacked the General.
- What's this, then?

670
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:14,269
- You're in danger, sir.
- I saw it all, General.

671
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:16,874
- This man came at you with that knife.
- That's not true.

672
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:20,509
I saw it as well.
He tried to assassinate you, sir.

673
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,010
Who are you?

674
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,079
- I'm...
- I know who he is.

675
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:26,388
Mr. Kemp.

676
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:32,725
I believe that you have read about
this fellow in your English newspapers.

677
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:35,157
That...

678
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,265
is the notorious villain...

679
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:41,302
William Reynolds.

680
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:45,360
Is that not the barbarian who committed
the atrocities in India?

681
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,312
- The very one, sir.
- Did he not die?

682
01:06:48,412 --> 01:06:50,555
General, all you've read is a lie...

683
01:06:50,655 --> 01:06:53,925
put forth by Charles Kemp because
of what I know from my service to him.

684
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:58,813
- Take him away, sir.
- Wait. Let him continue.

685
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:03,251
I have evidence... proving
that Charles Kemp was a guiding force

686
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:06,621
behind the violence committed in India
by the East India Company.

687
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:10,431
And more recently, the violence
committed in Philadelphia.

688
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:15,845
Once you see it, you'll agree. He should
be arrested and stand trial for his crimes.

689
01:07:22,737 --> 01:07:24,962
What is this farce?

690
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:29,411
Is this some kind of joke?

691
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:33,448
General, listen to me.
The package has been switched.

692
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:36,685
It originally contained a report
I obtained nine months ago

693
01:07:36,785 --> 01:07:39,420
outlining Mr. Kemp's misdeeds in India.

694
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,290
Let us suppose this document
really existed,

695
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:45,460
it would have prevented
the bombings in Philadelphia.

696
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,781
As you yourself have said, it's been
in your possession for nine months.

697
01:07:49,881 --> 01:07:55,977
Now, what innocent man would not have
handed it over directly to the authorities?

698
01:08:03,978 --> 01:08:05,487
Charlotte.

699
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:15,997
Son... are you William Reynolds?

700
01:08:18,326 --> 01:08:21,351
Yes... I am.

701
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:27,035
If the evidence is as it appears,

702
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:31,045
then this man hangs at dawn
for spying and armed sedition.

703
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,895
Take him away.

704
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:38,887
You and Charlotte
were never the same sort.

705
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:52,500
Will.

706
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:22,463
- William.
- Charlotte.

707
01:09:25,026 --> 01:09:26,304
I kept my promise.

708
01:09:27,328 --> 01:09:29,470
I told the truth.

709
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:34,575
But I was at fault to put all my trust
in that Parliamentary Report.

710
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:39,340
- Now it's gone.
- I don't understand what's happening.

711
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,211
You told me you had evidence.
Why... why did you wait?

712
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:46,147
Could you have stopped
the killing in Philadelphia?

713
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:48,623
I waited because of you.

714
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:54,049
- I did it all for you.
- For me?

715
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:59,891
I've been trying to become the man
that is... somehow worthy of you.

716
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:04,038
Of the respect you once gave me.

717
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:10,086
William, do you mean
to tell me that you...

718
01:10:10,538 --> 01:10:15,276
You were letting people die to somehow
earn redemption? Or my love?

719
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:17,679
I... I've known no other path.

720
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:21,356
I fooled myself into thinking
that I could be a good man.

721
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:25,720
That God would hear me.

722
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:28,122
Don't you know...

723
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:31,636
neither redemption or love

724
01:10:31,736 --> 01:10:34,068
can ever be earned.

725
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:37,899
You have but to ask.

726
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:39,867
They're both gifts...

727
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:44,112
gifts to be granted freely
from the heart of God.

728
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,052
And from my heart to yours.

729
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:15,837
You're a genius, sir.

730
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:18,272
No, it was easy actually.

731
01:11:18,372 --> 01:11:21,549
He was in business
for himself all along.

732
01:11:21,976 --> 01:11:24,352
Charlotte, my dear.

733
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:31,619
Is there news from Philadelphia?

734
01:11:32,186 --> 01:11:36,925
The Doctor's arrived. Mr. Jefferson
completed the Declaration...

735
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:39,494
to be read to Congress in the morning,

736
01:11:39,594 --> 01:11:41,669
then voted on.

737
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:44,205
In the morning?

738
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,250
Lord...

739
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:01,928
despite the crimes of this man,

740
01:12:03,484 --> 01:12:05,124
I know you know them fully...

741
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:10,944
<i>I pray you redeem his life.</i>

742
01:12:11,044 --> 01:12:13,328
<i>Redeem him.</i>

743
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:19,360
<i>And if I am to take part in your mercy,</i>

744
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:26,600
please instruct me in what I must do.

745
01:12:34,398 --> 01:12:37,618
The entire city will be in ashes,
all in a matter of seconds.

746
01:12:37,718 --> 01:12:40,555
Brilliant, Doctor. Brilliant.

747
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:42,300
Remote detonation.

748
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:48,763
The entire Continental Congress
will cease to exist.

749
01:12:48,863 --> 01:12:52,667
And the best of all the blame
will fall on William Reynolds,

750
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:55,836
the colony's very own Guy Fawkes.

751
01:12:55,936 --> 01:13:00,441
Saucy knave. Believed he was
good enough to marry my niece.

752
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:03,144
I begin to suspect her loyalty, sir.

753
01:13:03,244 --> 01:13:07,815
If she so much as visits his grave,
I want her dead.

754
01:13:07,915 --> 01:13:12,595
She becomes more like her
sanctimonious father every day.

755
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:18,603
Reverend, I had a deal with God.

756
01:13:21,662 --> 01:13:24,332
But it turns out the name
William Reynolds...

757
01:13:24,432 --> 01:13:27,280
was too evil for even him to redeem.

758
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:31,728
I'll be getting what I deserve tomorrow.

759
01:13:37,778 --> 01:13:42,933
Actually, someone else
already got what you deserve.

760
01:13:53,094 --> 01:13:56,613
- <i>Visitor for the condemned man.</i>
- <i>He's in the hold.</i>

761
01:13:56,713 --> 01:14:01,771
<i>It's a lady. She wishes
to see him up on the main deck.</i>

762
01:14:28,929 --> 01:14:31,432
- You shouldn't be here.
- I had to see you.

763
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:34,268
I did not know who else to turn to.

764
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:35,770
I beg your pardon.

765
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,749
Have they hurt you?

766
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:53,124
I never told you.

767
01:14:54,288 --> 01:14:56,331
The night I escaped Adlesbury...

768
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:00,955
Jeremiah...

769
01:15:01,055 --> 01:15:03,374
he gave his life for me.

770
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:13,081
I realized tonight that that's
the same thing that Christ did for me.

771
01:15:15,072 --> 01:15:17,385
I saw myself fully for who I am.

772
01:15:21,515 --> 01:15:24,187
And I have strived in vain...

773
01:15:24,785 --> 01:15:27,161
to redeem my name.

774
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:31,092
But, God, in His mercy...

775
01:15:31,392 --> 01:15:33,761
he has done the work
that I could never do.

776
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:36,904
He has redeemed my name
and he has given me his.

777
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:41,017
William... truly?

778
01:15:41,117 --> 01:15:42,704
Yes.

779
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:47,282
I have found acceptance in the divine heart
that I've sought in vain all my life.

780
01:15:48,242 --> 01:15:49,810
- Will, I came...
- I tried.

781
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:52,179
I grew to love the life
of Steven Walters.

782
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:55,550
- So did I.
- But it was a stolen name.

783
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,352
It was just another mask.

784
01:15:58,452 --> 01:16:01,255
- Will...
- It was a love you couldn't return.

785
01:16:01,355 --> 01:16:04,338
William, you'll have to save me.

786
01:16:04,438 --> 01:16:06,167
What?

787
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:09,670
Charlotte!

788
01:16:11,565 --> 01:16:13,086
Woman overboard!

789
01:16:13,386 --> 01:16:15,442
Woman overboard!

790
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:19,012
Where's she? Where?

791
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:30,754
Prisoner overboard! Prisoner overboard!

792
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:32,692
There they are!

793
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:36,230
No. Don't shoot the lady.

794
01:16:38,092 --> 01:16:40,377
I wasn't even trying to kiss you.

795
01:16:40,477 --> 01:16:43,280
My uncle plans to destroy
the assembly in Philadelphia.

796
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:45,206
They're right down there!

797
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:49,810
William?

798
01:16:55,342 --> 01:16:57,351
There she is.

799
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:01,289
Here you go, miss. Give me your hand.

800
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:09,731
- There you go.
- Where is he?

801
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:13,234
What's that?

802
01:17:20,734 --> 01:17:22,576
Well done.

803
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:29,964
Charlotte? Charlotte?

804
01:17:35,883 --> 01:17:39,286
- You are quite resourceful.
- Oh, well, you never asked.

805
01:17:39,386 --> 01:17:41,422
I'm an old hand at escaping
prison ships.

806
01:17:42,122 --> 01:17:46,160
- Do you intend that I row all the way?
- You could stay to be hanged,

807
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,070
or know that I chartered a carriage.

808
01:18:03,644 --> 01:18:05,819
Where did you find those?

809
01:18:06,947 --> 01:18:09,290
They were in my uncle's office.

810
01:18:10,717 --> 01:18:12,060
You stole these?

811
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:17,492
Borrowed. I have every intention
of returning them in Philadelphia.

812
01:18:18,592 --> 01:18:21,068
Can you make sense of these?

813
01:18:23,497 --> 01:18:26,339
- "City in ashes", he said.
- Mr. Franklin will be of help.

814
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:28,709
What are these symbols?

815
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:33,574
Explosive devices.

816
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:35,949
Guy Fawkes.

817
01:18:36,093 --> 01:18:37,561
What?

818
01:18:37,911 --> 01:18:40,514
The man who plotted to blow up
Parliament during the vote.

819
01:18:40,714 --> 01:18:43,992
Charles... he's planning
to blow up the Congress.

820
01:18:55,963 --> 01:18:57,264
What...

821
01:18:57,764 --> 01:19:00,301
You do know you've chartered
a smuggler's carriage.

822
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:10,177
Are you stealing those?

823
01:19:10,277 --> 01:19:12,052
Borrowing.

824
01:19:56,523 --> 01:19:58,398
Pray for me.

825
01:19:58,642 --> 01:20:00,882
You're not the same man.

826
01:20:02,463 --> 01:20:05,226
I can't save you, William Reynolds.

827
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:16,186
- Stay where you are safe.
- The Johnsons.

828
01:20:17,778 --> 01:20:21,154
- I will look for you there.
- I love you.

829
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,992
I love you.

830
01:20:42,936 --> 01:20:44,893
That's her.

831
01:20:45,806 --> 01:20:47,541
- Let me go!
- You're coming with us.

832
01:20:47,641 --> 01:20:50,104
- Get your hands off me!
- Charlotte!

833
01:20:50,204 --> 01:20:53,548
- No.
- Your uncle is looking for you.

834
01:20:54,048 --> 01:20:55,823
You have betrayed your family.

835
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:22,042
Mr. Franklin, get everyone out.
There a plan afoot to bomb this building.

836
01:21:22,142 --> 01:21:25,379
More nonsense!
We cannot afford any longer delay.

837
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:27,915
Wait! I know him.

838
01:21:28,415 --> 01:21:30,491
No, you don't, sirs.

839
01:21:30,968 --> 01:21:32,288
I am William Reynolds.

840
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:35,155
Former mercenary of the East India
Company, and currently a fugitive.

841
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:38,092
Oh, good. Nothing serious then.

842
01:21:38,492 --> 01:21:41,396
Make of me what you will, sirs.
But the threat is real.

843
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,203
Take him in hand.

844
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:31,985
- Gunpowder.
- A lot of gunpowder.

845
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:37,651
- How soon until the vote?
- At noon.

846
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:41,088
- But, who would...
- Charles Kemp.

847
01:22:41,188 --> 01:22:43,646
East India Company.

848
01:23:03,643 --> 01:23:05,179
What is this place?

849
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,623
Come find out for yourself,
Ms. Holloway.

850
01:23:28,068 --> 01:23:30,276
Sir, your niece is here.

851
01:23:31,505 --> 01:23:34,589
Basil tells me you've been
a naughty girl.

852
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:39,820
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you've chosen the wrong side.

853
01:23:49,389 --> 01:23:51,816
Electric fuses.

854
01:23:52,626 --> 01:23:55,149
That should take care of it.

855
01:24:39,106 --> 01:24:41,348
Capacitors are charging.

856
01:24:52,986 --> 01:24:57,711
Behold, Charlotte...
the Doctor's ingenious machine.

857
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:02,586
He uses the windmill to turn
this wheel, which, in turn...

858
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:05,847
generates Mr. Franklin's...

859
01:25:05,947 --> 01:25:08,506
invisible lightning.

860
01:25:09,136 --> 01:25:11,238
And when I throw that lever,

861
01:25:11,338 --> 01:25:16,276
it moves from the jars
to the accumulator up there.

862
01:25:16,776 --> 01:25:20,387
Once it has achieved sufficient power,

863
01:25:20,514 --> 01:25:25,285
it releases itself, traveling through wires
that we have placed under the city,

864
01:25:25,385 --> 01:25:30,290
utilizing Mr. Franklin's
brand new sewage system.

865
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:33,894
And where does that electricity
finally terminate?

866
01:25:33,994 --> 01:25:37,565
Barrels of gunpowder,
strategically placed.

867
01:25:38,765 --> 01:25:42,625
We've discovered
a practical use for electricity.

868
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,674
How many people do you intend to kill?

869
01:25:47,574 --> 01:25:49,602
Oh, how many people
do you believe would die

870
01:25:49,702 --> 01:25:52,816
if there is an extended war
between England and the colonies?

871
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:54,198
How many?

872
01:25:55,949 --> 01:25:59,277
How many people will die?

873
01:26:01,454 --> 01:26:03,096
Enough!

874
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:08,127
So that their desire for independence
is overwhelmed

875
01:26:08,227 --> 01:26:11,264
by their need for law and order.

876
01:26:11,364 --> 01:26:13,516
Provided by you.

877
01:26:13,616 --> 01:26:16,257
Who else could be entrusted with it?

878
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,407
Now, I'm sorry, my dear, but this chamber
is rigged to detonate with the city.

879
01:26:20,507 --> 01:26:24,390
The Doctor and I will be leaving,
of course. You will not.

880
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:26,736
Basil, bind her.

881
01:26:39,459 --> 01:26:41,802
God have mercy.

882
01:26:50,804 --> 01:26:53,140
They intend to blow up the entire city.

883
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:56,276
How would you harness
this much electricity?

884
01:26:56,376 --> 01:26:59,613
- Lightning?
- Too unreliable.

885
01:26:59,713 --> 01:27:02,349
A scientist might manufacture it,

886
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:06,906
but the generator would have to be
quite large and at a central location.

887
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:12,159
The wires. The wires
will lead me to the generator.

888
01:27:12,259 --> 01:27:14,668
Disarm as many as you're able.

889
01:27:16,763 --> 01:27:18,972
You may need this.

890
01:27:23,623 --> 01:27:25,546
Godspeed, my son.

891
01:28:03,943 --> 01:28:06,713
The detonation switch
is engaged, Mr. Kemp.

892
01:28:06,813 --> 01:28:08,188
Five minutes.

893
01:28:12,749 --> 01:28:16,129
Get this job done, boys.
It's time to depart.

894
01:28:17,758 --> 01:28:20,027
- There he is!
- It's the Highwayman.

895
01:28:20,127 --> 01:28:22,336
Take him! No mistakes.

896
01:28:23,096 --> 01:28:26,540
Tell Harrison to steepen
the pitch on the blades.

897
01:28:28,869 --> 01:28:30,270
Will!

898
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:32,472
I'm afraid Mr. Harrison
is asleep on the job.

899
01:28:32,572 --> 01:28:36,376
I will ensure that Mr. Harrison
never wakes up.

900
01:28:36,476 --> 01:28:40,186
- Charlotte.
- The chamber is rigged to explode.

901
01:28:40,714 --> 01:28:43,657
- I may need your help.
- Get rid of him.

902
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:02,369
More power, Doctor.
We must speed this up.

903
01:29:02,469 --> 01:29:04,520
Yes, Mr. Kemp.

904
01:29:09,776 --> 01:29:12,288
Faster, Doctor. Faster.

905
01:29:14,714 --> 01:29:16,857
The accumulator is nearly full.

906
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:20,601
Capacitors are activated, Doctor.

907
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:23,330
The generator is at maximum speed.

908
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:43,750
- The accumulator malfunctioned.
- Fix it.

909
01:29:53,486 --> 01:29:56,823
- Pull the lever!
- It's not ready yet.

910
01:29:56,923 --> 01:29:59,492
A misfire could trigger an explosion.

911
01:29:59,592 --> 01:30:02,405
The accumulator needs to charge again.

912
01:30:03,063 --> 01:30:04,450
I'll charge it.

913
01:30:24,851 --> 01:30:26,052
No!

914
01:30:27,487 --> 01:30:30,931
Mr. Kemp... we're out of time.
We must leave.

915
01:30:33,827 --> 01:30:36,136
Not without the city in ashes.

916
01:30:39,165 --> 01:30:41,368
You are horrified, Charlotte,

917
01:30:41,468 --> 01:30:44,638
to see the real man behind the mask.

918
01:30:44,738 --> 01:30:46,998
You're a monster.

919
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:52,228
We all have to come to terms
with our contradictions.

920
01:30:53,913 --> 01:30:55,949
I have.

921
01:31:01,354 --> 01:31:03,223
You must pull that lever back.

922
01:31:03,323 --> 01:31:07,445
Prepare for your independence,
Mr. Franklin.

923
01:31:08,461 --> 01:31:11,659
I cannot allow you to do that, my dear.

924
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:18,505
Mr. Kemp, please.

925
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:21,081
The machine is unstable.

926
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:26,980
Will. Will...

927
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,816
do you believe you can stop destiny?

928
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:31,351
10 seconds, Mr. Kemp.

929
01:31:31,451 --> 01:31:34,587
If you pull those wires,
you will certainly die.

930
01:31:36,189 --> 01:31:38,451
Come on, Will.

931
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:42,228
You have made your fortune doing
exactly what I asked you to do.

932
01:31:42,328 --> 01:31:44,464
I know you.

933
01:31:44,564 --> 01:31:46,616
This is not what you want.

934
01:31:46,716 --> 01:31:48,533
You are right, Mr. Kemp.

935
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:52,319
This isn't what I want.

936
01:31:53,423 --> 01:31:56,484
But I'm not in business
for myself any longer.

937
01:32:27,106 --> 01:32:30,210
By a unanimous vote
of the Continental Congress,

938
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:33,821
the Declaration of Independence passes.

939
01:34:19,753 --> 01:34:20,701
You'll pay for this.

940
01:34:20,801 --> 01:34:23,575
- Be quiet. Come on.
- You hear me? You'll pay for this.

941
01:34:24,123 --> 01:34:27,661
What is this? Wait!
Wait. What's going on?

942
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:29,863
A dispatch has arrived from New York.

943
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:32,632
It seems, you are indeed a wanted man.

944
01:34:32,732 --> 01:34:35,123
- Just as you said.
- What?

945
01:34:35,223 --> 01:34:38,072
Sir, this is ridiculous.
He needs a doctor. He's injured.

946
01:34:43,977 --> 01:34:46,229
You're just going to hang him,
after all of this.

947
01:34:46,329 --> 01:34:51,558
We have not yet decided whether we are
going to allow his extradition to New York.

948
01:35:01,594 --> 01:35:03,796
I cannot ask you to accompany me.

949
01:35:03,896 --> 01:35:07,233
Will, I pulled you out
of a pond as a stranger.

950
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,276
Do you think I would abandon you now?

951
01:35:10,803 --> 01:35:13,082
I do not know what lies ahead.

952
01:35:13,806 --> 01:35:16,176
Mr. Franklin will defend you.

953
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:18,784
As will I.

954
01:35:23,116 --> 01:35:25,719
From the first time I met you...

955
01:35:26,119 --> 01:35:29,461
I have been captivated
by the depths of your kindness.

956
01:35:31,741 --> 01:35:34,283
You were unconscious on that day.

957
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:47,147
Well, I'm not now.

958
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:58,785
Since the day
we last parted, I've been...

959
01:35:59,185 --> 01:36:02,718
trying to earn the right
to give you this ring.

960
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:07,313
You told me, I have but to ask.

961
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:11,137
I'm asking.

962
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:13,966
Could you see fit
to let me care for you...

963
01:36:14,066 --> 01:36:16,441
as you have for me?

964
01:36:18,371 --> 01:36:20,013
Yes.

965
01:36:20,773 --> 01:36:23,159
Yes. Yes.

966
01:36:23,259 --> 01:36:24,911
Yes.

967
01:36:25,011 --> 01:36:28,989
Of course. With all my heart, yes.

968
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:45,316
Then let it be God's will.

969
01:36:46,466 --> 01:36:48,407
You are.

970
01:36:49,802 --> 01:36:54,435
Come to think of it, our extradition laws
are rather ambiguous.

971
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:01,931
I hope you know what you are doing.

972
01:37:16,646 --> 01:37:18,254
What is that?

973
01:37:20,933 --> 01:37:23,370
Oh, it's from Mr. Franklin.

974
01:37:23,619 --> 01:37:26,202
"To the most honorable William Reynolds.

975
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:29,576
"You have rendered
a great service to our country,

976
01:37:29,676 --> 01:37:33,069
"for that I am grateful,
as others would be if they knew.

977
01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:35,481
"But they must never know.

978
01:37:35,581 --> 01:37:40,059
"The true battle is only just beginning.
We may have need for you again.

979
01:37:42,521 --> 01:37:45,675
"This coach will convey you not to jail,

980
01:37:45,775 --> 01:37:47,649
"but to my home...

981
01:37:47,749 --> 01:37:50,837
"where you may take whatever
restorative measures you must..."

982
01:37:50,937 --> 01:37:52,587
"and...
