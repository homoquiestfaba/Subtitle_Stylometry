1
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,906
Mark's here.

2
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,752
Hey, Megan.

3
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,855
Hi, Mark.

4
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,890
Lucky.
He doesn't even know my name.

5
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,125
You sure?

6
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,427
You find a way to slip it in
every time you see him.

7
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,464
Still, you have to work at it
to get noticed by the right guy.

8
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,033
Megan.

9
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,135
Later.

10
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,569
Hey, are you okay?

11
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,138
Yeah. Why?

12
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,006
You weren't
at the Johnsons' last night

13
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,141
for the service project.

14
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,076
Oh, that.

15
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,211
I had plans with Kim
and some others.

16
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,747
I thought you were
in charge of it.

17
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,550
I handed it off to someone else.
It went fine, right?

18
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,552
No big deal.

19
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,054
What'd you do last night?

20
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,355
We went to Pyro's.

21
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,057
The club.

22
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,393
You went clubbing
on a Tuesday night?

23
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,729
It's ladies' night.

24
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,642
Linda: Mark?

25
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,243
Yes?

26
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,281
Your meeting with Mr. Davidson
is about to start.

27
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,116
Thank you.

28
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,840
What are you
doing here?

29
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,377
Davidson asked him
to come.

30
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,512
So, do you guys know
what this is all about?

31
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,414
I have no idea.

32
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,650
Good.
We can start.

33
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,454
Hansu Technologies
is licensing our C25 chip.

34
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,456
That's the Chinese company,
right?

35
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,558
This is gonna be used for
their new wireless media player.

36
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,193
They're finally ready
to move forward on it.

37
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,795
They're getting ready
to manufacture it

38
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,197
at their Indonesia plant,
so I want you there.

39
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,632
Great.

40
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,567
You know this thing
inside and out,

41
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,570
so I need you to make sure
they don't change their minds.

42
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,005
Done.

43
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,708
And, uh, Megan.

44
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,177
You'll be handling this account
as we move forward.

45
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,512
Me?

46
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,447
You excel
in your responsibilities.

47
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,715
You show great promise.

48
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,786
Plus, Mark here thought
it might be a good fit.

49
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,287
Thank you.

50
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,657
Chris, you'll help with
the technical implementation.

51
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,892
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,260
Paul can't come?

53
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,861
His wife is due any day.

54
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,130
And I understand
Chris here speaks Chinese.

55
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,232
I do.

56
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,534
You speak Chinese?

57
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,171
I thought we were
going to Indonesia.

58
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,506
Most of their top executives
are Chinese.

59
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,841
It could be useful.

60
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,910
Check with Linda
for your travel arrangements.

61
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,045
You leave tomorrow.
That's it.

62
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,414
Thanks.
Mark:- See you tomorrow.

63
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,719
It's just
a business trip.

64
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,220
I know.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,155
So, what are you
so excited about?

66
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,391
I'm finally getting somewhere.
Did you hear what he said?

67
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,926
Yeah, that's
pretty flattering.

68
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,395
And I get to travel
and see the world.

69
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,597
And spend some time
with Mark Taylor.
- There is that.

70
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,199
Isn't he a bit old
for you?

71
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,768
I just heard. You get to
go somewhere with Mark.

72
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,269
How'd you hear so soon?
- Linda.

73
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,704
So, it's just you
and Mark?

74
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,473
No.
Chris is going, too.

75
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,707
Oh.

76
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,677
Thanks.

77
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,579
And it's just business.

78
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,780
What are you
gonna wear?

79
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,315
I have no idea.

80
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,251
Oh, it's okay.
I'll come over after work.

81
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,259
Exciting meeting?

82
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,195
What?

83
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,599
I get to go on a trip
with Mark Taylor.

84
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,503
Wow. I know 15 women in this
office who would kill to be you.

85
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,971
That's a first.

86
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,639
You don't want to go?

87
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,374
Would you?

88
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,976
He'll sweet-talk his way
past everyone,

89
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,311
and then
double-cross them.

90
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,615
He took all the credit
for the work we did on the C25,

91
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,251
and he got Brett fired
and moved us to the basement.

92
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,653
You think he's changed?

93
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,888
No.

94
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,291
But I don't know.
Mark's going places.

95
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,893
He's already
upper management.

96
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,262
Pretty soon, he's going to be
chief something-or-other.

97
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,432
Might not be a bad idea to let
it go, get on his good side.

98
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,933
Why should I trust him?

99
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,669
Do you really want to
back out of the trip?

100
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,672
No.

101
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,242
At least there's
an upside.

102
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,811
Megan's going, too.

103
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,446
Really?

104
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,114
Maybe you'll finally
ask her out.

105
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,017
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

106
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,885
Yeah. How's that working out
for you?

107
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,695
Mm, too tame.

108
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,897
Uh...

109
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:39,999
Ooh!

110
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,337
What?
Are you going to a funeral?

111
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,678
Oh, uh...

112
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,779
Why not?

113
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,047
[ doorbell rings ]

114
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,348
Hang on.

115
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,350
Don't mind me.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,520
Hey, Chris.

117
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,389
Hey.
Got your itinerary.

118
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,291
Oh, I forgot
to pick it up.

119
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,494
Linda came looking for you,
but you'd already left.

120
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,295
So I told her
I'd bring it by.

121
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,064
There's a commercial flight
to Malaysia,

122
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,567
then some jet to,
uh, Kupang -- Kupong.

123
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,369
Thanks.

124
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,104
You have your passport,
right?

125
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,174
Um...

126
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,710
Hang on.

127
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,980
You know,
I know I have one.

128
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,715
That's good.

129
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,950
Where is it?

130
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,386
So, how do you know
Chinese?

131
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,789
I did a study-abroad thing
in college.

132
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,324
Really?
That's a weird choice.

133
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,861
1.5 billion Chinese people.
Smart choice.

134
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,197
Normally, I'd assume that's
where you served your mission.

135
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,732
Yeah, I wanted to go,

136
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,336
But by the time I was baptized
and waited a year,

137
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,104
I was past the cutoff age.

138
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,741
Well, I hope we can explore
a little while we're in, um...

139
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,042
Uh...

140
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,310
Indonesia.

141
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,712
Right.

142
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,281
I don't know if we're gonna have
much time for fun on this trip.

143
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,350
Why not?
It's business.

144
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,653
A day to travel there, a day
back, two days of meetings,

145
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,421
not to mention
the time difference.

146
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,357
We'll make time for fun.

147
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,825
That'd be nice.

148
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,594
You know, I --

149
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,963
I don't get to see you
a whole lot outside of work.

150
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,733
Uh, is that
your subtle way

151
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,268
of bugging me
about going to church?

152
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,404
Not really.

153
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,374
Well, you know,
I've just been so busy.

154
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,209
Hey, it's your life.

155
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,276
Thank you.

156
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,846
Doesn't mean I don't worry,
though.

157
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,415
Worry?
Chris, I --

158
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,283
Oh, found it!

159
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,252
Still valid?

160
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,588
Uh.

161
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,989
Yes.

162
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,125
Shoes!
- Shoes!

163
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,526
Uh...

164
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,661
Well, I'll just leave you girls
to your shoes.

165
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,498
Yeah.
Thanks for bringing that over.

166
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,469
Gossiping about guys.
Yeah.

167
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,906
Oh.
Those kill my feet.

168
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,308
But they look so sexy.

169
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,511
So, what did Chris want?

170
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,880
I forgot something at work,
so he brought it for me.

171
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,082
Oh.
That was nice of him.

172
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,517
Yeah.

173
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,619
No. It's not like that.

174
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,154
We go to the same church.

175
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,457
Really? I didn't ever peg you
as the churchy type.

176
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:22,628
Now, Chris, that actually
explains so much.

177
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,696
A swimsuit.

178
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,997
Oh.

179
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,166
I don't think
we'll be going swimming at all.

180
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,134
Do you want
to risk that?

181
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,140
Uhh,
don't you have a bikini?

00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:39,798
The charter plane
went down yesterday.

544
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:41,333
What plane?

545
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,335
The plane with Mark, Megan,
and Chris.

546
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,105
Nobody knows where it is
or if anyone even survived.

547
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:48,540
They're searching for them,
and nobody's heard anything yet.

548
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:51,010
They crashed?

549
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:04,757
You really think
this is gonna work?

550
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:08,160
I figure
it's worth a shot.

551
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,195
I'm open
to suggestions.

552
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,365
I say we keep somebody
on the beach at all times.

553
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,668
What?
To flag them down?

554
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:18,971
If they're looking for us,
why not?

555
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,874
The beach would be
the easiest place to find us.

556
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:26,045
Doesn't hurt.
The more we try, the better.

557
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:31,250
What about a fire?

558
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,134
Okay, so,
if we see anything come by,

559
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,936
we light
the signal fire.

560
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,038
Do you think the tide
will be a problem?

561
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:54,907
We're far enough away
from the water.

562
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,475
It should be fine.

563
00:32:56,543 --> 00:33:00,612
We should probably build
a shelter tomorrow.

564
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,549
You really think we're
going to be here awhile.

565
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:10,356
I'd rather be ready for it
than not.

566
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:20,933
You know, I hate to admit it,
but he's probably right.

567
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,561
I was thinking for a roof.
What do you think?

568
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:51,964
Sure.

569
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,639
No.
Put it up here.

570
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,976
Fine.

571
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:07,980
No.
This way.

572
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:12,551
Be my guest.

573
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,587
What's your problem?

574
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:16,789
My problem?

575
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:19,591
Yeah. I'm not blind.
You got a problem, just tell me.

576
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,460
That is so Mark Taylor.

577
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:23,962
What?

578
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,968
You don't know
what you're doing.

579
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,370
You don't do anything.

580
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,073
You just sweet-talk everyone,
flash your little smile,

581
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,075
And take credit
for their work.

582
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,576
Are you still
hung up on that?

583
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:38,811
You got where you are
because --

584
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:40,979
I got where I am
because I work hard.

585
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:44,650
I may not be the hands-on guy,
but I know what I'm doing.

586
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:50,789
You sure do.

587
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,499
What are you doing?

588
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,402
Seeing if there's anything
we might have missed.

589
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,670
Did you find anything?

590
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:07,406
Nope.

591
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:12,845
I knew there was a raft!

592
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:16,648
You doing okay
with all this?

593
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:19,318
Yeah.

594
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:23,856
You're handling this better
than I thought you would.

595
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:25,224
The crash?

596
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:29,061
I thought you'd be like
every other woman in the office,

597
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:32,431
who, let's face it,
would be freaking out.

598
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:34,900
Then again, they'd be
completely awestruck

599
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,935
by you being here.

600
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,775
You know,
I kind of get tired of all that.

601
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:44,910
You do?

602
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,780
Yeah, it's every guy's fantasy
to be chased by women.

603
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:52,284
But everyone seems to put me
on this pedestal.

604
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,253
They don't see
the real me.

605
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,390
Is the real you better
or worse?

606
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:01,160
Both.

607
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,729
At least you're honest.

608
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:05,230
Well,
I'm not perfect.

609
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:07,266
But there's more to me
than just...

610
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,968
money, success,
good looks?

611
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:12,338
Sure,
point them all out.

612
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:15,140
But that's exactly
what people see first.

613
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,776
So, what's the cure?

614
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:19,812
Give away the money?
Fail?

615
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:22,915
Smear a little mud
on your face?

616
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:24,717
No.

617
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:28,187
Just find someone
who can see more than that.

618
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,195
We should get back.

619
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:38,430
Make sure Chris hasn't
torn apart the shelter

620
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,599
and built a computer.

621
00:36:49,175 --> 00:36:51,210
Are you
putting on cologne?

622
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:54,680
The benefits of having
your stuff wash up.

623
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,484
Do you mind?

624
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,619
What are you doing?

625
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:04,123
I'm seeing what we have
in case we can use it.

626
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,159
That's not whipped cream.

627
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,695
Thanks.

628
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:10,963
How would it help?

629
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:12,498
Not sure yet.

630
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:13,866
I know fruit is healthy,

631
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:16,568
but a little variety
would be really nice.

632
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:23,008
Hey, Chris,
can I borrow your knife?

633
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:42,861
I thought
you hated fish.

634
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,532
At this point,
I'm willing to give it a try.

635
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,100
Can I help?

636
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:49,668
Please.

637
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:52,538
I don't even think
I was close.

638
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:58,677
Oh!

639
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:01,880
Are you sure
this even works?

640
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:03,749
Nope.

641
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:08,187
Hurry! Hurry!
Right there!

642
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:11,590
Oh.

643
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:12,758
Mark: Almost.

644
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:14,560
Great.

645
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,503
Ooh.
[ chuckles ]

646
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:26,705
Aah.

647
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:33,512
Ugh. Ah.

648
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,085
Wait.
I think I got it!

649
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,187
Flammable.

650
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:43,222
Hmm.

651
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:44,990
Yeah!

652
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:47,159
Ohh!

653
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:49,828
You got one!

654
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:56,135
Hey,
look what we got.

655
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,940
Now what?

656
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:04,043
We gut it.

657
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,944
Really?

658
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,881
Well, I'm going to go see
what else I can find.

659
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:10,516
I'll be back in a while.

660
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,255
Um...
I'm gonna go with you.

661
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:19,258
Mark,
you've got the signal fire?

662
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,026
You guys don't want fish?

663
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:24,129
I'm okay.

664
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,532
I'll just put it
on ice, then.

665
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:33,806
I can still smell it.

666
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,040
The fish?

667
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:36,575
Ugh.

668
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:37,843
I'm going to go out
on a limb

669
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:39,378
That you don't like sushi,
either.

670
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:40,479
Nope.

671
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,848
Can't get past
the seaweed stuff.

672
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:45,117
It's not the fish
that bothers you?

673
00:39:45,185 --> 00:39:48,687
Yeah, I don't know.
I never got that far.

674
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:50,823
What was that?

675
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:54,460
Manna from heaven.

676
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:00,632
What are you doing?

677
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,701
Don't you want one?

678
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:03,736
Well, yeah, but...

679
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:05,671
I'll just climb up there.

680
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,008
Are you sure
you can get up there?

681
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,075
I got it.

682
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:11,710
I'm sure.

683
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:12,945
Just watch.

684
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:20,386
Nice.

685
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:23,555
Just watch.

686
00:40:23,623 --> 00:40:25,124
Okay.

687
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,227
[ laughs ]

688
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:30,062
Are you all right?

689
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:37,903
Okay, so, maybe I need to
rethink this.

690
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:48,180
Okay. Better.

691
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:50,916
Come on.

692
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:57,790
Okay,
now I'm impressed.

693
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,342
Nice work.

694
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,077
Well...

695
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,479
Megan.

696
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,781
Do you see that?

697
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:24,983
A boat!

698
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:26,051
Mark!

699
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,824
Mark!

700
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:34,993
Mark, light the signal!

701
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,029
Mark, light the signal!

702
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:38,597
A boat!

703
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,833
What boat?

704
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,474
Hurry up, man!
Hurry up!

705
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:54,146
You're trying to light
a big log.

706
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:55,748
Get the little stuff.

707
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:58,183
What were you doing?
The boat was right there.

708
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:00,119
You couldn't light it
fast enough!

709
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:01,687
I wouldn't have to
if you'd been awake!

710
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,389
Where's the boat?

711
00:42:03,456 --> 00:42:04,957
You really think
this is going to work?

712
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,759
Those ships are miles out.

713
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:09,495
The whole island would have to
be on fire for them to notice.

714
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:10,662
You are so...

715
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,431
What?

716
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:22,007
You're right.

717
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:24,677
We need
a better solution.

718
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,352
That looks good.

719
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,155
If we had some black pepper
and some lemon,

720
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:38,190
This would be
first-class.

721
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:39,825
You cook?

722
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:41,627
Shh.

723
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,395
Don't tell the girls
in the office.

724
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:44,897
It's our secret.

725
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:46,031
Oh, shut up.

726
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,535
How do you open this?

727
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,206
Here. I'll do it.

728
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:56,709
Where is my knife?

729
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,248
Thanks.

730
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,608
What about a flare?

731
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:31,176
What?

732
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:33,445
For a way
to signal help.

733
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:36,782
Unless a flare gun washes up,
we're out of luck.

734
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:37,850
No, but...

735
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:39,451
You keep thinking.

736
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm hungry.

737
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,288
And dinner is served.

738
00:43:43,356 --> 00:43:45,424
Wow.

739
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:48,861
I thought
you didn't like fish.

740
00:43:48,928 --> 00:43:51,697
It can't be that bad.

741
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:53,732
Should we bless it?

742
00:43:55,835 --> 00:43:57,936
Mark,
do you mind if we...

743
00:43:58,004 --> 00:44:00,039
Chris, we don't need to.

744
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:02,975
Go ahead.

745
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:05,477
Do you want to say it?

746
00:44:05,545 --> 00:44:06,979
No.

747
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:15,287
John.
Watch it.

748
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:17,056
Sorry.

749
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,425
Are you okay?

750
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,694
I'm fine.

751
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:23,562
Everyone's fine,
apparently.

752
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,330
Nobody's
heard anything more yet.

753
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:28,133
Until we do, we just have to
hope they're all okay.

754
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:30,669
I thought all the women would
still be crying over Mark.

755
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:33,105
You have not been to
the women's bathroom recently.

756
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,907
No, I haven't.

757
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:36,442
Look, you're not alone.

758
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:38,444
I can't believe
how excited I was for Megan.

759
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:41,680
A chance to go on a trip,
with Mark and all.

760
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:44,650
And now...

761
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:47,119
What if it had been me?

762
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:50,322
That's what
you're worried about? You?

763
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,658
No, it's not --

764
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:54,827
They could be treading water
right now.

765
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:56,695
There could be sharks nipping
at their legs.

766
00:44:56,763 --> 00:45:00,366
They could already be...

767
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:03,469
I hope Megan's okay.
I hope they're all okay.

768
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:07,773
Hey, if they're alive,
Chris will take care of Megan.

769
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:09,274
You think so?

770
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:10,709
I know so.

771
00:45:12,345 --> 00:45:13,812
Does Chris like Megan?

772
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,880
I didn't say that.

773
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:16,949
So, he doesn't.

774
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:18,984
No.

775
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,386
Well, it's kind of...

776
00:45:20,453 --> 00:45:21,887
I knew it.

777
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:24,423
I cannot even wait
until Megan gets back.

778
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:26,425
She might believe it.
It's kind of obvious.

779
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:28,794
Come on, this isn't just
some juicy gossip.

780
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:31,230
Two seconds ago,
you were practically grieving.

781
00:45:31,297 --> 00:45:34,299
Have some sense
of decency.

782
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:11,403
Didn't your mom ever tell you
not to swim alone?

783
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,108
You were sleeping.

784
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:19,178
Where's Mark?

785
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:21,613
It's his day
to find fruit.

786
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:24,717
That reminds me.
I need to get the water.

787
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:26,952
Do you want some company?

788
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,221
Don't you have to
man the beach?

789
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:31,557
Not if Mark gets back.

790
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:36,362
Besides, it'll give him
some time to work on his tan.

791
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:43,068
So,
you don't like Mark.

792
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:46,138
Wow.
That wasn't even a question.

793
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:47,639
Why?

794
00:46:47,707 --> 00:46:49,241
Why don't I like him?

795
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,677
Yeah.

796
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:54,213
I just don't think he's
everything he pretends to be.

797
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,849
Who said he's pretending?
He's a nice guy.

798
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:58,117
Can be.

799
00:46:58,184 --> 00:46:59,651
You don't know him
like I do.

800
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:01,487
And you don't know him
like I do.

801
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:02,688
Come on, Megan.

802
00:47:02,756 --> 00:47:05,224
A few days ago,
he was "Mark Taylor" to you.

803
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,059
A lot has happened
since then.

804
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:10,963
I just don't see
how you can fall for him.

805
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:13,165
It.

806
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:16,235
Why do you care
if I like him or not?

807
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:18,804
I don't.
I just --

808
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:20,606
I don't want you to forget
who you are.

809
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,541
Thanks, Dad.

810
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:24,076
Hey, I've seen it.

811
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:25,577
You're changing.

812
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:27,179
Change is a good thing.

813
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:28,480
Not all the time.

814
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:29,715
What do you know?

815
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:32,184
Oh, come on.
Don't act like I'm blind.

816
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:36,655
When you got your job
at the company,

817
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:38,857
you know what made me
notice you?

818
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:41,193
You were in the breakroom,
<i>reading The Book of Mormon.</i>

819
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,795
Every day you did that.

820
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:44,830
There was something different
about you.

821
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:47,199
Yeah,
it's called being a dork.

822
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:48,734
No. It's called
cherishing something.

823
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:50,469
Because of your example,

824
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:52,071
I asked about
what made you different,

825
00:47:52,138 --> 00:47:55,507
what gave you
that light in your eyes.

826
00:47:55,575 --> 00:47:59,812
It made me realize I was missing
something in my life.

827
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:01,880
How can you
be ashamed of that now?

828
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:02,981
I'm not!

829
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:04,650
You got all embarrassed
about praying.

830
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,985
I didn't want to force it on Mark.
- Nice excuse.

831
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:09,321
What about not going to church?
- I go.

832
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,890
Or clubbing all weekend,
or working even on Sunday?

833
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,692
When I met you,
you never would have done that.

834
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,694
You never would be justifying
drinking coffee and lattes

835
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:16,795
because it's "medicinal."

836
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:18,964
That was different.
- Sure, it was.

837
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:20,866
Growing up in the church,
it's so restricting.

838
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:22,201
You don't know
what it's like.

839
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:24,837
What? How could I understand
because I'm a convert?

840
00:48:24,904 --> 00:48:26,038
Yeah!

841
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:28,574
I still had to make changes,
but it was worth it.

842
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:29,575
But for me --

843
00:48:29,642 --> 00:48:31,410
You can rationalize it
all you want.

844
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:33,112
But until you get past
the excuses

845
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:37,216
and think about it honestly,
you're just lying to yourself.

846
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,425
Get past the excuses, Megan.
Don't be ashamed.

847
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,660
I am ashamed. Of you!

848
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:50,629
Why don't you try to deal
with what I face?

849
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:52,531
Walk a mile in my shoes!

850
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:56,869
These aren't even shoes!
Ugh!

851
00:49:12,752 --> 00:49:14,286
Nice.

852
00:49:16,022 --> 00:49:17,723
Thanks.

853
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,594
Where's Megan?

854
00:49:22,662 --> 00:49:24,463
She's not back?

855
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:27,232
No. I thought you guys
went to go get water.

856
00:49:28,868 --> 00:49:30,769
We split up.

857
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,501
A little help here.

858
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:08,707
She's still not back.

859
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:15,080
It's going to
get dark soon.

860
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:20,953
Let's go find her.

861
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:34,266
Megan!

862
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:36,669
What did you guys fight about
anyway?

863
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:38,971
Who says we fought?

864
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,673
I'm not trying to make you
feel guilty.

865
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,108
Just a guess.

866
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:46,478
It's complicated.

867
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,316
Wait. Do you guys have a thing
going on or something?

868
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:52,851
What? No.

869
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,486
No?

870
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:56,288
Okay.

871
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:58,991
Well, we're just...

872
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,826
friends.
- Right.

873
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:02,528
Good.

874
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:05,030
I've known her awhile,

875
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:09,068
and I worry about some of
the things she's mixed up in.

876
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:10,569
What?
Like drugs?

877
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:11,904
No, nothing like that.

878
00:51:11,971 --> 00:51:14,873
Megan's a grown woman.
She knows what she's doing.

879
00:51:14,941 --> 00:51:16,408
I hope so.

880
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:18,577
What was that?

881
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:20,679
Just because somebody knows
what they're doing

882
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:21,947
doesn't mean it's right.

883
00:51:22,015 --> 00:51:24,650
Why do I get the feeling
you're turning this on me?

884
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:27,920
I'm not trying to make you
feel guilty or anything.

885
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:30,322
Megan!

886
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,890
Just level with me.

887
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,659
Last year, you took credit
for what wasn't yours.

888
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:34,860
You get that, right?

889
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,628
You see it that way.

890
00:51:36,696 --> 00:51:39,098
We all agreed to work
on the C25 together,

891
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:40,466
but I was the Manager.

892
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:41,900
I get blamed
for the failures.

893
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,068
And the successes?

894
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:44,103
It was our success.

895
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,537
That's not what you told
everyone.

896
00:51:45,605 --> 00:51:46,739
It doesn't matter.

897
00:51:46,806 --> 00:51:48,607
Who do you think
they want to succeed?

898
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:50,075
You have to be
in front of the pack

899
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,744
and appeal
to what they expect.

900
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:55,781
If you want success,
you have to make it and take it.

901
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,818
Maybe you're just not cut out
for it.

902
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:03,389
Maybe it's
not worth it.

903
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:06,025
Not like that.

904
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,335
Where's the...

905
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:18,837
is this my punishment?

906
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:24,410
I only missed a few Sundays.

907
00:52:27,914 --> 00:52:30,249
I wonder if she made it
back to the beach.

908
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:33,152
She's got the internal compass
of Hansel and Gretel,

909
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:36,121
without the breadcrumbs.

910
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,190
Well,
we haven't found her.

911
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:40,025
You think?

912
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,594
Megan!

913
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:44,663
Nope.
Still no Megan.

914
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:48,133
You're welcome to go
back to camp at any time.

915
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:49,568
Let's split up.

916
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:51,737
Fine.

917
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:56,909
[ thunder crashes ]

918
00:52:56,976 --> 00:52:57,976
Aah!

919
00:53:03,149 --> 00:53:06,719
Megan!

920
00:53:16,296 --> 00:53:17,429
Chris!

921
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:19,765
Mark!

922
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,241
Megan!

923
00:53:44,924 --> 00:53:48,127
Megan, can you hear me?

924
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:58,737
Heavenly Father, I'm sorry.

925
00:53:58,805 --> 00:54:00,739
Please help.

926
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:09,181
Help!

927
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:13,018
Chris!
- Megan?

928
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:14,319
Hello?

929
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:16,155
Megan!

930
00:54:16,222 --> 00:54:17,222
Chris?

931
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,895
Can you climb up to me?

932
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:25,531
It's too steep.
I keep slipping.

933
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:30,102
Hang on!

934
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,280
Grab the vine.
I'll pull you up.

935
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:51,390
Come on, I've got you.

936
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,126
It's okay.

937
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,934
Okay.

938
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:10,476
I slipped.

939
00:55:10,543 --> 00:55:13,212
I can tell.

940
00:55:13,279 --> 00:55:14,947
How'd you get up here?

941
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:17,182
I was trying to get
back to the beach.

942
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,052
You're on a cliff.
Beaches are at sea level.

943
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,653
I don't know
where everything is.

944
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:23,022
I thought
it might get me back.

945
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:24,089
Okay.

946
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:32,631
I'm sorry about before.

947
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:37,703
I didn't want
to make you mad.

948
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:40,372
I know.

949
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:47,913
Megan,
I want you to be happy.

950
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:50,983
And I know I go about it
the wrong way.

951
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:52,751
Mark: Megan!

952
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,088
Are you okay?

953
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:58,724
I am now.

954
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,893
Let's get you cleaned up
and back to the fire.

955
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,994
Come on.

956
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:16,508
Mark:
It's almost done.

957
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:21,347
You want some water?

958
00:56:21,414 --> 00:56:23,549
Sure.

959
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:35,694
Thank you.

960
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:39,798
For finding me.

961
00:56:45,372 --> 00:56:47,072
I'm glad
you weren't hurt.

962
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:50,676
Here.
- Thanks.

963
00:56:52,912 --> 00:56:55,381
Should we, um...

964
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:57,216
Should we pray?

965
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:02,488
Go for it.

966
00:57:02,555 --> 00:57:04,490
I never got into it,
but...

967
00:57:04,557 --> 00:57:07,526
Really?

968
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,995
God requires
too much time.

969
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:13,132
I'm busy enough
as it is.

970
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:17,670
I'll say it.

971
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:31,717
I could use
another one of these.

972
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,252
Can I have the shell
when you're done?

973
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,054
What for?

974
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:36,789
Um...

975
00:57:36,856 --> 00:57:38,357
Remember
that flare idea?

976
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:39,525
You found a flare?

977
00:57:39,592 --> 00:57:41,427
No.
I'm making one.

978
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,228
You really think
you can make one?

979
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:45,064
Contents
under pressure.

980
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:48,767
When they get hot,
say by fire, they explode.

981
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,539
Put all that in a coconut shell
with the flame,

982
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:55,240
It might work.

983
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:57,276
You take yourself
too seriously.

984
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:59,478
So, it's a mini bomb.

985
00:57:59,546 --> 00:58:00,979
Isn't that dangerous?

986
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:03,115
I'm not saying I'm gonna hold it
up when I light it,

987
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:04,783
but if it works...

988
00:58:04,851 --> 00:58:05,884
If.

989
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:08,087
What about
somebody seeing it?

990
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:09,722
From a distance?

991
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:13,158
I haven't thought
that far.

992
00:58:13,226 --> 00:58:15,427
You can say that again.

993
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:20,833
It's clever.

994
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:31,977
Why aren't you intimidated
by him

995
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:34,713
or by
what anyone else thinks?

996
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:37,349
Especially church?

997
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:41,487
I feel like everyone looks down
on us and what we believe.

998
00:58:41,554 --> 00:58:42,755
Do they?

999
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:44,757
I didn't
when I met you.

1000
00:58:44,824 --> 00:58:47,793
Yeah, well,
you're a rare exception.

1001
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:50,729
I think most people respect
what you believe.

1002
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:53,165
It doesn't
feel that way.

1003
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:56,502
You're letting it bother you
more than it should.

1004
00:58:56,569 --> 00:59:01,006
Sure, believing in god,
trying to do what's right.

1005
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:02,675
It makes us stand out
a little.

1006
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:05,844
A little?

1007
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:07,680
What's more important?

1008
00:59:07,747 --> 00:59:11,283
What everyone else thinks
or what God thinks?

1009
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:18,624
I've heard that before,
but it's not that simple.

1010
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,159
Sure, it is.

1011
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:21,994
Not for me.

1012
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,196
It can be.

1013
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:26,432
Look, for me,

1014
00:59:26,499 --> 00:59:29,435
I'd be crazy if I gave up
something I know is true

1015
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:32,137
for what everyone else thinks
is more important.

1016
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:33,839
Fame. Wealth.

1017
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:35,274
Respect.

1018
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:37,176
Those aren't
all bad things.

1019
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:41,513
No, not if you have
your priorities straight.

1020
00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:47,219
Was it a hard adjustment
for you?

1021
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:49,555
Yeah.

1022
00:59:49,622 --> 00:59:53,659
But it was worth it,
because it's true.

1023
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,829
God is real,
and he loves us.

1024
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:59,498
What else matters?

1025
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:11,243
Mr. Davidson.

1026
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:14,179
Have a seat.

1027
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:17,683
John, you've been taking on
a lot of Chris Russell's work.

1028
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:20,252
Yes, sir,
until he gets back.

1029
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,555
There's a reality
we have to face.

1030
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:26,058
We have to move forward,
and that means making changes.

1031
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:27,826
You've been doing
a good job,

1032
01:00:27,894 --> 01:00:30,129
so we'd like you to take over
for Chris permanently.

1033
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:34,867
But when he comes back,
then...

1034
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:38,437
<i>If he gets back,</i>
we'll adjust.

1035
01:00:38,505 --> 01:00:41,373
Keep up the good work.

1036
01:00:45,445 --> 01:00:47,980
See anything?

1037
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:49,448
Minnow.

1038
01:00:49,516 --> 01:00:50,449
Filling.

1039
01:00:50,517 --> 01:00:52,551
Any luck?

1040
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:54,820
Not yet.

1041
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:58,957
Oh,
I'll be right back.

1042
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:08,701
Thanks.

1043
01:01:08,768 --> 01:01:10,502
Are we going to have anything
to cook today?

1044
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,072
The fish
aren't cooperating.

1045
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,641
I'd love to go for anything
besides just fish.

1046
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:17,276
Like...

1047
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,578
Chinese food.

1048
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:22,514
Well, if I see any Szechuan
Chicken running around,

1049
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:24,316
I'll let you know.

1050
01:01:24,384 --> 01:01:26,318
I'd even settle
for Indonesian food.

1051
01:01:26,386 --> 01:01:27,686
I was looking forward
to that.

1052
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:30,456
If we made it without any
problems, we wouldn't care.

1053
01:01:30,523 --> 01:01:32,291
We'd probably be wishing
we had a burger.

1054
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:33,692
That's true.

1055
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,694
I guess sometimes
we just take things for granted

1056
01:01:35,762 --> 01:01:37,029
that are
right in front of us.

1057
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:38,997
Yep.

1058
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:45,137
Like matches.

1059
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,639
I've got a whole drawerful in
my kitchen next to the candles,

1060
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:50,642
and here it takes Chris forever
just to light a fire.

1061
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,811
Candles?

1062
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:56,081
So?

1063
01:01:56,149 --> 01:01:58,517
They smell nice.

1064
01:02:36,122 --> 01:02:37,990
Boom.

1065
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,336
Didn't you say something
about swimming alone?

1066
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:57,276
This reminds me
of my sister's place.

1067
01:02:57,344 --> 01:02:59,244
She lives near a beach?

1068
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:01,113
Yeah.

1069
01:03:01,181 --> 01:03:03,482
I spent a summer there
a couple years ago.

1070
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:06,719
It was actually right before
I decided to get baptized.

1071
01:03:06,786 --> 01:03:09,455
It's a good place to get away,
clear your head,

1072
01:03:09,522 --> 01:03:12,858
find the answers that you're
searching for, you know?

1073
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:17,196
It's also about five minutes
away from McDonald's.

1074
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:21,967
I wish
we were there now.

1075
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:26,772
Was your family okay
with you getting baptized?

1076
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,509
They thought it was weird
that I wanted it.

1077
01:03:30,577 --> 01:03:34,580
My parents had some concerns,
but they're cool with it now.

1078
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,954
Hey, I was thinking.

1079
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:43,589
Yeah?

1080
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:44,823
Um...

1081
01:03:44,891 --> 01:03:47,026
I, uh...

1082
01:03:47,093 --> 01:03:52,297
We both work a lot,
and I see you there.

1083
01:03:52,365 --> 01:03:53,666
Okay.

1084
01:03:53,733 --> 01:04:00,406
But it'd be nice if I could see
you, you know, somewhere else.

1085
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:03,075
Chris,
I get it, okay?

1086
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:05,277
I know I need to be better
about going to church,

1087
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,946
but you just
have to let me.

1088
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:10,949
No, that's not
what I meant.

1089
01:04:11,017 --> 01:04:12,985
Really?

1090
01:04:14,487 --> 01:04:16,355
I was hoping --
- Hey!

1091
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:17,823
Do you guys have
any more water?

1092
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:20,626
No,
but I can go get some.

1093
01:04:22,262 --> 01:04:24,430
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1094
01:04:24,497 --> 01:04:26,265
Okay.

1095
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:28,701
I was just hoping
we could go out sometime.

1096
01:04:28,768 --> 01:04:30,202
Did you say something?

1097
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:33,539
No.

1098
01:04:35,108 --> 01:04:37,376
Does it ever feel like

1099
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:39,945
something always gets in the way
of what you want?

1100
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:43,115
Sure, sometimes.

1101
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:45,951
It's pretty annoying.

1102
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:48,320
That's why you got to keep
trying and never give up.

1103
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:51,457
Although, if you keep trying
and still don't get anywhere...

1104
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:53,392
It just depends
on how bad you want it.

1105
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,296
If you quit,
you're guaranteed to fail.

1106
01:04:57,364 --> 01:05:00,332
I'm going to get
some fruit.

1107
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,326
Megan.

1108
01:05:27,394 --> 01:05:29,862
We've always had
a great friendship.

1109
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:31,263
I really value that.

1110
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,165
It's just I...

1111
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:37,536
always wanted something more.

1112
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:38,804
No.

1113
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:42,174
Get to the point faster,
before something interrupts.

1114
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:43,742
[ sighs ]

1115
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:44,843
Megan, hi.

1116
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:49,148
Aah.

1117
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:51,684
Great!

1118
01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:05,364
Could work.

1119
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,802
Megan, I just think that...

1120
01:06:11,571 --> 01:06:13,105
Hey.
- Hey!

1121
01:06:13,173 --> 01:06:15,407
Came to make sure
you didn't get lost again.

1122
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:17,843
I got here,
didn't I?

1123
01:06:17,911 --> 01:06:18,844
Yeah.

1124
01:06:18,912 --> 01:06:20,212
I was just thinking.

1125
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,247
I wonder how everyone is
back at home.

1126
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:24,450
Probably business
as usual.

1127
01:06:24,517 --> 01:06:26,819
Come on,
someone would miss us.

1128
01:06:26,886 --> 01:06:29,154
You, sure.

1129
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:31,557
Don't you have family?

1130
01:06:31,624 --> 01:06:33,892
Yeah, but I think I have
some old girlfriend listed

1131
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,594
as my emergency contact.

1132
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:37,896
Well, she'd call them.

1133
01:06:37,964 --> 01:06:39,398
It didn't end well.

1134
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:42,434
She'd probably be celebrating
if she thought I was dead.

1135
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:44,436
Wow.

1136
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:46,171
What about you?

1137
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:51,143
They're out of State,
but they're probably panicking.

1138
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:53,178
Hey.

1139
01:06:53,246 --> 01:06:54,480
They'll be fine.

1140
01:06:54,547 --> 01:06:55,914
We'll get back.

1141
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:12,598
Megan, when I think
of a flower...

1142
01:07:12,665 --> 01:07:14,967
I've hit a new low.

1143
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:18,303
Okay.
Just what I want her to know.

1144
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:20,639
How I feel.

1145
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,877
Megan, I like you.

1146
01:07:24,944 --> 01:07:28,213
Smooth.
Just blurt it out, Chris.

1147
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:30,416
Smart.
You are so smart, Chris.

1148
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:32,384
Okay, how about...

1149
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:37,156
It could have been worse.
I keep telling myself that.

1150
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:41,126
If you didn't come on the trip,
it'd be Chris and me stuck here.

1151
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:43,028
A nightmare
for you both.

1152
01:07:43,096 --> 01:07:45,230
I'm glad you came.

1153
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:47,132
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

1154
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:51,570
What about your girlfriend?
Jenna?

1155
01:07:51,638 --> 01:07:53,038
No.

1156
01:07:53,106 --> 01:07:56,008
Or any of the other girls
you date?

1157
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:57,843
I've got a bit of a reputation,
don't I?

1158
01:07:57,911 --> 01:07:59,712
I didn't mean that.

1159
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:03,716
The girls I've dated,
they're fun, but that's it.

1160
01:08:03,783 --> 01:08:05,718
There's nothing more
to it.

1161
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:08,320
I know that sounds awful.

1162
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:11,357
<i>They just try to get</i>
<i>my attention,</i>

1163
01:08:11,424 --> 01:08:13,058
Instead of being
the type of girl

1164
01:08:13,126 --> 01:08:16,328
that just catches your attention
automatically.

1165
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,432
Like you.

1166
01:08:28,141 --> 01:08:30,409
Listen, Megan, if nothing else,

1167
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:34,480
I just thought you should know
in case you felt the same...

1168
01:08:36,816 --> 01:08:38,484
...way.

1169
01:08:49,662 --> 01:08:50,929
I'm sorry.

1170
01:08:50,997 --> 01:08:52,865
I hope I didn't
cross some line.

1171
01:08:52,932 --> 01:08:56,602
Yeah.
No, it was fine.

1172
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:57,670
You sure?

1173
01:08:57,737 --> 01:08:59,505
I don't want it to be awkward
for us.

1174
01:08:59,572 --> 01:09:02,074
I'm sure.

1175
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:10,983
Good.

1176
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:13,719
Not awkward.

1177
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:07,006
I finally broke things off,
and I was so relieved.

1178
01:10:07,073 --> 01:10:10,943
That totally reminds me
of this guy that I dated.

1179
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:17,216
Hey,
where have you been?

1180
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:19,551
Working.

1181
01:10:28,862 --> 01:10:30,529
What's this?

1182
01:10:30,597 --> 01:10:32,631
Catapult.

1183
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:34,533
Is this what you've been
working on?

1184
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:36,068
Yeah.

1185
01:10:36,136 --> 01:10:37,836
Why?

1186
01:10:37,904 --> 01:10:40,906
I'm ready to get off
this island.

1187
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:43,876
What's it for?

1188
01:10:43,943 --> 01:10:46,812
To launch the flare.

1189
01:10:47,947 --> 01:10:50,082
Give that back.

1190
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,350
Seriously, Chris.

1191
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:53,252
Is this the best
you can come up with?

1192
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:54,720
Tell you what.

1193
01:10:54,788 --> 01:10:56,889
You think of something better
with the resources we have,

1194
01:10:56,956 --> 01:10:59,658
and you can criticize me
all you want.

1195
01:11:40,033 --> 01:11:42,234
What are you
looking for?

1196
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:44,036
Cologne.

1197
01:11:44,104 --> 01:11:45,771
Won't help
with the smell.

1198
01:11:47,574 --> 01:11:49,575
Have you seen
my shaving cream?

1199
01:11:49,642 --> 01:11:52,311
Yeah.

1200
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:53,912
Hey!

1201
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:57,182
What's his problem?

1202
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,852
I don't know.

1203
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:06,158
Hey.

1204
01:12:06,226 --> 01:12:07,793
Hey.

1205
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:10,229
Is this
what you've been doing?

1206
01:12:10,296 --> 01:12:11,830
Yeah.

1207
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:14,733
You built a catapult.

1208
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:16,935
Wow.

1209
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:19,805
Why didn't you ask us
for help?

1210
01:12:19,873 --> 01:12:22,541
I didn't know
how much support I'd get.

1211
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:24,777
Plus, you were caught up
in other things.

1212
01:12:24,844 --> 01:12:27,146
You know,
you're not so subtle.

1213
01:12:27,213 --> 01:12:29,248
Sorry.

1214
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:33,285
Mark's really sweet,
even more than I thought before.

1215
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:35,454
I didn't think
that was possible.

1216
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:37,456
Come on,
don't do that.

1217
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,425
Be happy for me.

1218
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:42,494
If you're happy,
I guess that's all that matters.

1219
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:46,432
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

1220
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,500
I won't get hurt.

1221
01:12:50,437 --> 01:12:52,771
When we get back, do you think
he's going to be as sweet?

1222
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:57,109
Do you ever wonder why he always
has a new girlfriend?

1223
01:12:58,845 --> 01:13:00,546
You'll start to see
who he really is.

1224
01:13:00,613 --> 01:13:01,947
I like who he is.

1225
01:13:02,015 --> 01:13:04,283
You like who you think he is.
There's a difference.

1226
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:07,152
Why are you being so mean
about this?
- I'm not.

1227
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,188
I'm just trying to get
out of here.

1228
01:13:09,255 --> 01:13:11,290
You two may be happy
to stay here forever,

1229
01:13:11,358 --> 01:13:13,859
But I'm not going to stick
around as the third wheel.

1230
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:15,027
What?

1231
01:13:15,095 --> 01:13:17,029
I can't take this.

1232
01:13:17,097 --> 01:13:19,198
What are you
talking about?

1233
01:13:19,265 --> 01:13:21,300
You really don't know?
- No.

1234
01:13:21,368 --> 01:13:23,569
I'm talking about you.

1235
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:24,803
Us.

1236
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:26,839
I've been trying to tell you
for the longest time,

1237
01:13:26,906 --> 01:13:29,641
But you barely even notice me
when Mark's around.

1238
01:13:32,078 --> 01:13:34,346
I like you, Megan.

1239
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:35,347
A lot.

1240
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:38,517
But now
I'm not even sure why.

1241
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:41,053
I mean, do we still believe
in the same things?

1242
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:42,588
Don't question
what I believe.

1243
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,723
Just because I don't make
a spectacle of my testimony

1244
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:46,058
doesn't mean
I don't believe.

1245
01:13:46,126 --> 01:13:48,327
Your actions are a reflection
of your beliefs.

1246
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:50,729
You're trying so hard to fit in
and be accepted

1247
01:13:50,797 --> 01:13:52,998
that you're compromising
the things that really matter.

1248
01:13:53,066 --> 01:13:54,066
You know what?

1249
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:55,901
I'm tired of you
always judging me.

1250
01:13:55,969 --> 01:13:57,302
Nothing I do
is ever good enough.

1251
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:58,370
I'm never strong enough,

1252
01:13:58,438 --> 01:13:59,905
not the perfect person
you want me to be.

1253
01:13:59,973 --> 01:14:01,607
Why don't you stop being
so self-righteous

1254
01:14:01,675 --> 01:14:03,008
and let me be who I am?

1255
01:14:04,644 --> 01:14:07,446
You're right.

1256
01:14:07,514 --> 01:14:12,251
I just worry about you,
probably more than I should.

1257
01:14:14,421 --> 01:14:18,557
I just see these glimpses of
the Megan I fell in love with.

It doesn't matter.

1259
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:26,031
I guess
you've made your choice.

1260
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:41,480
Where have you been?

1261
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:47,119
Just thinking.

1262
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:02,101
I can't.

1263
01:15:05,105 --> 01:15:08,440
I can't take it anymore.

1264
01:15:11,611 --> 01:15:13,712
Please.

1265
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,782
This is my limit.

1267
01:15:23,456 --> 01:15:25,624
Help me.

Please.

1269
01:16:04,964 --> 01:16:07,633
What's that?

1270
01:16:24,217 --> 01:16:26,885
Is that really
what I think it is?

1271
01:16:26,953 --> 01:16:30,022

It's a plane!

1272
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:32,024

Hey!
Come on, where are you?

1274
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:39,932
I can hear it.

Hey!
- Come on!

Wait!
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

1286
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,162
He's turning around!

1287

Down here!

1288
01:17:44,564 --> 01:17:45,898
They see the flare!

Hey!

1298
01:18:09,389 --> 01:18:11,323
I think he sees us.

1299
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:12,624
Yeah!

1300
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:15,327
Yes! Come on!

1301
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:21,166
We're going home!

1302
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:24,670
Yeah!
- Hey!

1303
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,842
Yes!

1304
01:18:31,644 --> 01:18:33,412
Yes.

01:18:56,036 --> 01:18:57,336
Hey.
- Hi.

1307
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,371
Wow, you look great!
- Thank you.

1308
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:02,007
Not bad for your first day
back at work.

1309
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:03,776
It's too bad
about those shoes.

1310
01:19:03,843 --> 01:19:05,611
I can't believe you and Mark
are a thing.

1311
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,346
I don't know what the rest of us
are going to do.

1312
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:08,547
But there's a new guy.

1313
01:19:08,615 --> 01:19:10,716
Not only is he tall and rich,
he's divorced.

1314
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,826
Congratulations.

1315
01:19:20,894 --> 01:19:22,861
I was going
for "glad you're alive,"

1316
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:25,397
but this was all they had left
at the bakery.

1317
01:19:25,465 --> 01:19:27,399
I think it confused
some people.

1318
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:28,634
Nice.

1319
01:19:28,702 --> 01:19:30,369
Just glad
to have you back.

1320
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:31,737
Thanks.

1321
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:36,875
Hey, Mark.

1322
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:38,944
Hey.

1323
01:19:39,012 --> 01:19:42,748
So, um, I owe you
a new pair of jeans.

1324
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:45,250
Oh, thanks.

1325
01:19:45,318 --> 01:19:48,787
Do you want to get something
to eat tonight?

1326
01:19:48,855 --> 01:19:51,657
Some Chinese food?

1327
01:19:51,725 --> 01:19:54,393
I can't. I've got too much
to catch up on.

1328
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:05,671
Megan:
What's the occasion?

1329
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:07,239
Chris:
Being alive.

1330
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:08,974
John got it for me.

1331
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:10,776
Nice.

1332
01:20:10,844 --> 01:20:12,911
People I've never met
kept stopping by my desk

1333
01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:14,079
and eating it.

1334
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:16,949
The cake,
not my desk.

1335
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:19,051
Got it.

1336
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:21,920
So, crazy day, huh?

1337
01:20:21,988 --> 01:20:23,455
Not really.

1338
01:20:23,523 --> 01:20:25,457
John pretty much was me
while I was gone.

1339
01:20:25,525 --> 01:20:28,060
Not much for me to do.

1340
01:20:29,896 --> 01:20:31,463
Uh...

1341
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:36,335
Hey, in all of this, I didn't
get the chance to thank you.

1342
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:38,337
You got us home.

1343
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,706
The plane helped.

1344
01:20:40,774 --> 01:20:42,274
It wasn't all me.

1345
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,176
But they never would have
seen us,

1346
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:47,046
and it's not just that.

1347
01:20:47,113 --> 01:20:50,015
You really saved us.

1348
01:20:51,484 --> 01:20:54,486
You're welcome.

1349
01:20:54,554 --> 01:20:58,724
Listen, about what happened,
I wanted to apologize.

1350
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:01,727
You were right
about me judging you.

1351
01:21:01,795 --> 01:21:03,328
I shouldn't have said --

1352
01:21:03,396 --> 01:21:05,397
you...

1353
01:21:05,465 --> 01:21:07,166
You don't
have to apologize.

1354
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:10,736
I just wanted you to know

1355
01:21:10,804 --> 01:21:13,172
that I'm glad you introduced me
to the gospel.

1356
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:18,644
Going back to not having that
in my life,

1357
01:21:18,712 --> 01:21:22,514
I can't imagine it.

1358
01:21:22,582 --> 01:21:26,518
Knowing that I'm not alone
makes all the difference.

1359
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:30,255
Uh.

1360
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:32,224
You're, uh...

1361
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:33,859
You're welcome.

1362
01:21:35,595 --> 01:21:37,229
Look,
today is my last day.

1363
01:21:37,297 --> 01:21:39,531
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go.

1364
01:21:39,599 --> 01:21:42,668
I'll talk to you later.

1365
01:21:45,605 --> 01:21:46,872
Hi, john.
- Hi.

1366
01:21:48,608 --> 01:21:50,843
Need a hand?

1367
01:21:52,278 --> 01:21:54,179
Something you want
to tell me?

1368
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:55,748
I'm leaving.

1369
01:21:55,815 --> 01:21:58,884
Whoa.
Did they fire you?

1370
01:21:58,952 --> 01:22:01,787
No, it's not that.
It's, um...

1371
01:22:01,855 --> 01:22:03,622
It's time.

1372
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:05,791
Chris.

1373
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:07,860
I need to move on.

1374
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:53,372
So, how did you survive?

1375
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,443
We ate fruit and coconuts,
anything we could find.

1376
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,611
But then I got to thinking,
"what about fish?"

1377
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,613
So I made this spear.

1378
01:23:01,681 --> 01:23:05,150
I go knee-deep in water
and just waited.

1379
01:23:05,218 --> 01:23:06,352
Wow.

1380
01:23:06,419 --> 01:23:07,519
Skip to the end.

1381
01:23:07,587 --> 01:23:09,321
You guys haven't even heard
the best part.

1382
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:11,557
Tell them about how you got
everyone off the island.

1383
01:23:11,624 --> 01:23:15,194
So, I gather up all my stuff,
mousse and shaving cream,

1384
01:23:15,261 --> 01:23:17,763
and we put the stuff in coconuts
so we could make a flare.

1385
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,064
Then I got to thinking,

1386
01:23:19,132 --> 01:23:21,200
"How are we gonna get
these flares up in the air?"

1387
01:23:21,267 --> 01:23:23,469
So we build this catapult,
right?

1388
01:23:23,536 --> 01:23:24,903
Hey, John.

1389
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:25,904
Hey.

1390
01:23:25,972 --> 01:23:28,073
Where's Chris?
He's gone.

1391
01:23:28,141 --> 01:23:30,743
Oh. Do you know
when he'll be back?

1392
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:32,611
He quit.

1393
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:34,947
He did? When?

1394
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,915
Yesterday.
You saw him.

1395
01:23:36,983 --> 01:23:39,418
He didn't even
say goodbye.

1396
01:23:39,486 --> 01:23:41,153
Maybe he didn't
get a chance.

1397
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:44,656
Did you guys hear everything
Mark did on that island?

1398
01:23:44,724 --> 01:23:46,892
Yeah.
I was there.

1399
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,660
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
I forget about that.

1400
01:23:48,728 --> 01:23:52,131
So, what is going on
between the two of you?

1401
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:55,034
I don't know.

1402
01:23:55,101 --> 01:23:57,436
Mark:
Let's go get some dinner.

1403
01:23:57,504 --> 01:23:59,638
Woman: I thought you and Megan
were involved.

1404
01:23:59,706 --> 01:24:02,307
Megan's nice,
but we're just friends.

1405
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:03,976
Really?

1406
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:07,913
This may sound awful,
but she's a little shallow.

1407
01:24:07,981 --> 01:24:09,548
I don't know her
that well.

1408
01:24:09,616 --> 01:24:11,617
You should have seen the bag
she brought on the plane.

1409
01:24:11,685 --> 01:24:14,219
That alone was enough
to take us down.

1410
01:24:21,795 --> 01:24:23,829
[ crying ]

1411
01:25:31,698 --> 01:25:33,532
There you are!
- Hi.

1412
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,069
Hey. Okay, so,
this weekend, Vegas.

1413
01:25:37,137 --> 01:25:39,838
A bunch of us are going.
Are you in?

1414
01:25:39,906 --> 01:25:41,340
Can't.

1415
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:42,808
I have Church this Sunday.

1416
01:25:42,876 --> 01:25:44,877
You're picking Church
over Vegas?

1417
01:25:44,944 --> 01:25:47,646
You are starting to sound
like Chris.

1418
01:25:47,714 --> 01:25:49,281
What's wrong with that?

1419
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:53,485
Nothing.
It's just a little geeky.

1420
01:25:53,553 --> 01:25:55,821
Maybe.

1421
01:25:55,889 --> 01:25:58,791
But thanks
for inviting me.

1422
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:02,327
Okay.

1423
01:26:06,499 --> 01:26:08,801
We'll send that
right over.

1424
01:26:08,868 --> 01:26:11,103
Thank you.

1425
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:13,539
Hey, Megan.
- Mark.

1426
01:26:13,606 --> 01:26:15,474
I don't have any plans tonight.
Want to go out?

1427
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:17,943
Thanks, but no.

1428
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:20,312
What about
tomorrow night?

1429
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,881
It's not an issue of when.

1430
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:24,950
I think I'm a little
too shallow for you.

1431
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:28,854
What?
You have a better offer?

1432

<i>Hey, this is Chris.</i>
<i>Sorry I'm not around.</i>

1433

<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

1434
01:26:48,174 --> 01:26:50,175
Where is he?
- Who?

1435
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:52,011
Chris.
He's not answering his phone.

1436
01:26:52,078 --> 01:26:53,679
He said he was
going to relax a bit,

1437
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:56,148
clear his head
or whatever.

1438
01:27:02,088 --> 01:27:03,856
<i>Hey, this is Chris.</i>
<i>Sorry I'm not around.</i>

1439
01:27:03,923 --> 01:27:05,557
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

1440
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:07,826
Hi. It's Megan.

1441
01:27:07,894 --> 01:27:10,095
I heard you were out of town,

1442
01:27:10,163 --> 01:27:14,967
and I wanted to see you
and talk.

1443
01:27:15,035 --> 01:27:18,470
Give me a call back whenever.

1444
01:27:18,538 --> 01:27:21,206
Yeah. Bye.

1445
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,048
Hey, Megan.
- Hi.

1446
01:27:29,115 --> 01:27:31,250
Did you find Chris?

1447
01:27:31,317 --> 01:27:32,818
Sort of.

1448
01:27:32,886 --> 01:27:34,653
He's at his sister's.

1449
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:35,921
In Hawaii?

1450
01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:39,692
I called him,
but he hasn't called me back.

1451
01:27:39,759 --> 01:27:41,727
Maybe he didn't check
his messages.

1452
01:27:41,795 --> 01:27:45,064
It might be kind of awkward
over the phone anyway.

1453
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:46,665
Why?

1454
01:27:46,733 --> 01:27:48,467
Well, he told me --

1455
01:27:48,535 --> 01:27:51,170
I said that --

1456
01:27:51,237 --> 01:27:53,105
It's a long story.

1457
01:27:53,173 --> 01:27:55,541
One of those, huh?

1458
01:27:55,608 --> 01:27:57,176
Yeah.

1459
01:27:57,243 --> 01:27:59,545
It'd be better
face-to-face.

1460
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:01,447
Then go see him.

1461
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:05,617
I don't know
that he'd want that.

1462
01:28:05,685 --> 01:28:07,953
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

1463
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:11,457
I don't know.

1464
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:16,595
Look, if it's important to you,
isn't it worth it?

1465
01:28:25,238 --> 01:28:27,673
Yeah, a window seat's fine.

1466
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:31,477
Are you sure there's not
anything else leaving today?

1467
01:28:31,544 --> 01:28:33,012
Two hours?

1468
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:35,647
No, no.
I can make that.

1469
01:29:12,819 --> 01:29:14,820
[ car door closes ]

1470
01:29:16,222 --> 01:29:17,356
Hi.

1471
01:29:18,925 --> 01:29:20,759
Hi.

1472
01:29:20,827 --> 01:29:22,928
I don't know if this is
the right place or not.

1473
01:29:22,996 --> 01:29:24,697
I'm looking for Chris.

1474
01:29:24,764 --> 01:29:25,998
Are you his sister?

1475
01:29:26,066 --> 01:29:27,366
You must be Megan.

1476
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:28,967
Yeah.

1477
01:29:29,035 --> 01:29:30,703
He went down
to the beach.

1478
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,705
Thanks.

1479
01:29:54,928 --> 01:29:59,198
You didn't get enough
of the beach?

1480
01:29:59,265 --> 01:30:01,300
I figured
you'd come here.

1481
01:30:01,368 --> 01:30:04,136
I called around, trying to find
your sister's address.

1482
01:30:04,204 --> 01:30:06,105
I called the Bishop
to get your parents' number.

1483
01:30:06,172 --> 01:30:07,840
That was after
the Elder's Quorum President

1484
01:30:07,907 --> 01:30:09,274
and the
Relief Society President

1485
01:30:09,342 --> 01:30:13,045
and, well,
you get the idea.

1486
01:30:13,113 --> 01:30:17,082
Your parents were suspicious
about a random girl calling.

1487
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:19,485
They finally told me
where you were,

1488
01:30:19,552 --> 01:30:22,688
and I got a flight here.

1489
01:30:23,957 --> 01:30:27,559
How'd you know I'd go
to my sister's place?

1490
01:30:27,627 --> 01:30:30,763
You said you come here
to clear your head.

1491
01:30:33,066 --> 01:30:36,335
So, quit your job.

1492
01:30:38,204 --> 01:30:40,072
It was time.

1493
01:30:42,008 --> 01:30:44,510
I was thinking
of quitting, too.

1494
01:30:44,577 --> 01:30:46,378
Why?

1495
01:30:46,446 --> 01:30:50,215
It might be awkward,
working with Mark.

1496
01:30:53,253 --> 01:30:56,689
I liked
who he pretended to be.

1497
01:30:56,756 --> 01:30:59,925
I kept convincing myself
that's what I wanted.

1498
01:30:59,993 --> 01:31:03,762
I finally realized
you were right about Mark

1499
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:07,433
and also about me.

1500
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:12,638
I was changing who I should be
just to try and please everyone.

1501
01:31:12,706 --> 01:31:19,578
You made me realize that,
even if I didn't want to.

1502
01:31:21,281 --> 01:31:22,881
You're a better influence
in my life

1503
01:31:22,949 --> 01:31:25,050
than Mark
or anyone could be.

1504
01:31:28,755 --> 01:31:30,489
I only regret...

1505
01:31:30,557 --> 01:31:33,392
Well, I have two regrets.

1506
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:36,395
What?

1507
01:31:36,463 --> 01:31:40,165
One, I was doing
all the wrong things.

1508
01:31:40,233 --> 01:31:43,002
I might have opened your eyes
to the Gospel,

1509
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:45,938
but you opened mine
in how to live it.

1510
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:56,448
And two, that I might have
missed my chance to be with you.

1511
01:32:07,594 --> 01:32:10,095
You only have one regret.

1512
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:34,319
So...what's next?

1513
01:32:34,387 --> 01:32:36,288
How about dinner?

1514
01:32:36,356 --> 01:32:38,791
I know
this great sushi place.

1515
01:32:38,858 --> 01:32:39,892
No!

1516
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:41,960
I've had as much fish
as I can stand.

1517
01:32:42,028 --> 01:32:45,007
Come on. I'll take
the seaweed off for you.

1518
01:33:44,898 --> 01:33:45,898
