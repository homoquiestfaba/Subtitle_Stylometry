00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:39,931
[clears throat]
Dad.

181
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:43,521
You're just gonna stay
in here and watch them
flirt with each other?

182
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,006
Okay, i'll just...

183
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,078
[chuckles]
I'll just go somewhere else.

184
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,597
Yeah.

185
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,634
So, Morgan!

186
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:55,429
What movie did you two
see again?

187
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:56,810
-What was it called?
-Bailey!

188
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,191
Shut up!

189
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:01,090
"Bailey, Shut up!"

190
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:04,473
He's cute.

191
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,233
Yeah.

192
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,512
Thanks for unstealing my wallet.

193
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:11,204
You're welcome.

194
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,931
So, can I come in?

195
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:17,072
Why?
There's no valuables inside.

196
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:20,282
I just want to see where
the dragonfly sleeps.

197
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,410
Why do you have
an Asian brother?

198
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,171
Because I have an Asian brother.

199
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:51,623
Satisfied? It's just a room.
I sleep there.

200
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:53,763
You happy now?

201
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,593
What are you,
a "flasher" on the weekends?

202
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,905
A flasher?

203
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:59,908
Well you know,
those guys that run
into a crowd,

204
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:03,601
open their coat,
flash everyone their
cock and then run out.

205
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,879
That's a detective's coat.

206
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,122
My Dad was a detective,

207
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,778
so I kind of grew up
in that fold.

208
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:11,989
So that's what you wanna be
when you get all grown up?

209
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:15,440
Take over all your dad's
unsolved cases?

210
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,927
Maybe.

211
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:23,483
Look, I don't mean
to be mean. But uh...

212
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:26,106
I'm really tired.

213
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:29,592
Well I'm not leaving until
I find out something about
you I like.

214
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:33,113
Right now,
you're pretty perfect.

215
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:35,322
Close your eyes.

216
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,531
You won't like this...

217
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,499
What are you gonna do?
Flash me?

218
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,638
My eyes need to be
open for that.

219
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,329
I'm pretty sure
I'll like what I see.

220
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,193
Close them!

221
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,788
[clothes rustling]

222
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:59,036
[clothes rustling]

223
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,969
Okay, open them.

224
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,042
[Jordan laughs]

225
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,183
Who am I?

226
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:09,218
I don't know.

227
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:10,771
Inspector Gadget?

228
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:13,188
Inspector Clouseau!

229
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,362
From the Pink Panther?
The famous French detective?

230
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,846
Are you serious?

231
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,815
I mean I heard of
the Pink Panther,
but I always thought it was a

232
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:21,541
-kinky sex position.
-Unbelievable!

233
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:22,818
We're watching one.

234
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,545
Didn't we just see
a movie last night?

235
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,271
My parents worry a lot.

236
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:30,584
Movie theaters are much safer
than night clubs.

237
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:32,828
Depends on the movie.

238
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:35,003
Well, if you're not leaving

239
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:39,766
How about I show you
the entire movie in five minutes
interactively?

240
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,492
What do you mean?

241
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,184
[puts pipe down, key jingles]

242
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:49,569
You have exactly 30 seconds
to hide this key anywhere
in this room

243
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:51,709
And as a highly experienced
detective,

244
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,780
I will find it no more
than three minutes.

245
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:55,713
Hmm. You wanna bet on that?

246
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,094
What you got?

247
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:59,199
It's not what I got.
It's what I want.

248
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:01,063
And what's that?

249
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,928
You.

250
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,070
If you lose,

251
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:12,109
you have to spend the
entire night with me.

252
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,250
And if I win,

253
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:19,323
you leave immediately
and you never return.

254
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:21,704
[Jordan chuckles]

255
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,844
You're on!

256
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,193
I'm going to blindfold you.

257
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,988
Girls cheat.

258
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,857
[Jordan whistles and hums]

259
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:42,553
Don't peek.

260
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,935
I'm hiding it now.

261
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:52,287
[rattling and banging]

262
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:58,638
[Jordan whistles]

263
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:03,850
[rattling continues]

264
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:05,990
[door slams]

265
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,718
[book flap thuds]

266
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,409
Done.

267
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,275
Solve the case, detective.

268
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,692
[imitating Peter Sellers]
Most cases are solved

269
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:21,937
not by knowing where
it is hidden,

270
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:26,321
but by whom it was hidden by.

271
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:31,291
[magnifying glass
drops on ground]

272
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:33,362
[Jordan] You give up?

273
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:34,950
Um...

274
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:40,852
[imitating Peter Sellers]
Never. I gave up giving up
many years ago.

275
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,095
You want a hint?

276
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,097
Oh, but you have already
given me so many.

277
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:45,340
Bullshit, have not.

278
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,376
I know exactly where
the key is hidden.

279
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:48,584
You're bluffing.

280
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:50,069
Am I?

281
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:54,073
I raise the bet.

282
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,351
If you lose,

283
00:17:56,385 --> 00:18:00,631
You have to feed me
and you have to spend
the night with me!

284
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,047
And when you lose, you leave.

285
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,912
But before you do,
you cook for my entire family.

286
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,431
I don't cook.

287
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,605
Then I better be bluffing.

288
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,263
Deal!

289
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:20,409
First thing to know when
you are given a case
is expect the unexpected.

290
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:22,515
That way you won't
be surprised by anything

291
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:25,794
In this case,
the unexpected is expected.

292
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:29,315
I would never expect you
to hide the key somewhere
where I'd expect it to be

293
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:33,457
so that's exactly where
I should expect to find it.

294
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:34,975
You scare me.

295
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,563
[pocket rustles]

296
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:40,188
Just as I expected.

297
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:42,017
But how?

298
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:44,502
Same way you got my wallet.

299
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,402
Use the blindfold as a decoy

300
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:49,197
like your kiss.

301
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:51,716
[Jordan sighs]

302
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,167
About your wallet, I'm sorry.

303
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,135
Everything's still in there.
I...

304
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,481
tried to steal it at first

305
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:00,069
but I got punished,
so I put it all back.

306
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,175
Who punished you?

307
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,419
One of your private eyes.

308
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,146
Little fella,
black and yellow suit.

309
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,114
I got stung by a bee!

310
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,082
[imitates Peter Sellers]
It's not my bee.

311
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,775
You're a very strange girl,
Morgan.

312
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,261
No. I'm a hungry girl.

313
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,470
I'm starving.
Where's your girlfriend

314
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:22,575
Patience, Bails.

315
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:23,748
Girlfriend?

316
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:24,818
He's not my girlfriend.

317
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:27,096
Wait, "he's"?
I'm confused.

318
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,409
-So, who's this guy? Clearly?
-[Dennis laughs]

319
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:32,240
He is just different,
that's all.

320
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:34,897
And you met this different
guy at the theater.

321
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:36,968
I'd hardly call him a guy, Mom.

322
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:38,763
-[Dennis laughs]
-Why? Is he...

323
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,387
Oh! Is he one of those
metrosexuals?

324
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:42,733
Is he pretty?

325
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:43,975
You'll see.

326
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,461
He expresses himself,
that's what's important.

327
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:49,015
Not everyone is brave
enough to do that.

328
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:53,916
How is it wearing a skirt
makes you brave?

329
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,953
Like a kilt, you mean?
Like a, Irish?

330
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,161
Oh, Scottish!

331
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,854
No. He just likes skirts,
so what?

332
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,856
[door bell rings]

333
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:04,789
All of you behave.

334
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,207
Dad, be nice.

335
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,347
When am I not nice?

336
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,245
[door slams]

337
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,144
-And there's a man at the door.
-Yes, just...

338
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,561
I can't wait to see this.

339
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:23,394
Pizza?
I thought he was making dinner.

340
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:29,607
No,
I was making dinner... happen.
And it's happening.

341
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:34,819
Mom!

342
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:35,889
What?

343
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:37,028
Don't stare.

344
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,996
-Oh, I'm--
-No, it's okay.

345
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,411
If I'm going to
look this pretty,

346
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:43,276
I have to get used to the
attention it brings, right?

347
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,382
I didn't catch your name.

348
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,212
I'm Jordan.

349
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:52,768
Dennis.

350
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:58,153
That's a strong grip, Dennis.

351
00:20:58,187 --> 00:20:59,844
[Jordan chuckles nervously]

352
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,297
I'm Janet.

353
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:06,506
I assume you've met Bailey.

354
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,404
I did.

355
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,855
Aw yeah. I shall call
you Air Jordan.

356
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,411
BOOSH! Let's eat!

357
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:21,556
So, Jordan...
Where are you from?

358
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,110
I don't like to focus on
the past much.

359
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:26,112
Waste of time if you ask me.

360
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:28,494
Well, where's your family?

361
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:29,357
Dad!

362
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:31,945
It's just a question, Morgan.

363
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,154
Well I'm assuming...

364
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,847
my Mom is exactly where she was
when I left.

365
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,158
On the couch.

366
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:39,574
And my Dad, well,

367
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:42,266
he left before I was me,
so there's that.

368
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,682
Have you lived here long?

369
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,236
I just sorta go

370
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:48,341
when it's time to go.

371
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,309
Not much for nesting,
personally.

372
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,069
I like to travel as well.

373
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,623
What statement are
you trying to make by
wearing that skirt?

374
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:55,728
Dad!

375
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:57,143
It's just a question!

376
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:59,559
I'm just curious as to
what compels him to dress
like a female.

377
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:04,253
He shouldn't do it
if he can't answer
why he does it.

378
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,738
Isn't that right, Jordan?

379
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:07,878
I guess I just find it
a little disturbing

380
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:14,367
that society says girls wear
skirts and dresses and boys
wear pants and cargo shorts.

381
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,749
It's all the same fabric
cut differently.

382
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,820
We're all the same people,
raised differently.

383
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:21,650
So, wearing a skirt
is just your way
to rebel against society.

384
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:22,686
I understand that.

385
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,756
It's not rebelling,

386
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,965
it's just simply acknowledging
the fact that

387
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,139
this stereotype is bullshit.

388
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:30,279
Why not just wear
what you want to wear?

389
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:31,626
Be who you want to be?

390
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,834
Yeah, I agree.

391
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:37,839
You know, makeup was common
with men in the old days.

392
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,081
See?

393
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:42,257
It's about self liberation.

394
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,570
Free yourself from the
shackles of conformity.

395
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:46,606
Yeah, sure.

396
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,297
Become unemployed

397
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,230
Get a gun, do drugs

398
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,612
As long as it expresses
your individuality.

399
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,338
Whoa, who said anything
about a gun?

400
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,410
Guns are for pussies
who can't fight.

401
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:00,206
How about we change the subject?

402
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,416
How do you plan on
supporting a family?

403
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:05,798
How are you ever going
to finance a house?

404
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:07,903
I don't need a house.

405
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,803
Jordan, have you
ever been arrested?

406
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:12,252
-Dad!
-Please!

407
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:14,323
That's extremely rude.

408
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:16,015
Jordan, let's eat
the rest upstairs.

409
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,432
I just want to know
why he has no regard
for the rules put in place.

410
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,709
No, dammit.
Don't...

411
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:23,678
Jordan, take anything
that he says personally.

412
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:26,888
He's just, he's a...
he's an old fart.

413
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:29,546
He just, you know

414
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,756
doesn't want his daughter
dating a domestic terrorist,
bro.

415
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:37,726
Domestic terrorists are usually
well educated, white,

416
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:42,731
ultra religious,
second amendment loving
right wing fanatics!

417
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:47,080
I'm a poor,
unemployed Atheist mutt.

418
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:49,807
I'm like a father's
dream come true!

419
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:53,397
You're worse than he is.
I'm eating alone.

420
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:57,953
It was lovely meeting you all.

421
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:00,749
Morgan!

422
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:04,201
-Oh, come on!
-What the hell?

423
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,720
You were a hippie once too.

424
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:07,894
That's not a hippie!
I was nothing like that!

425
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:10,276
Morgan is a gay lesbian.

426
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,312
Oh sweetie, your sister
is not a lesbian.

427
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,418
Lesbians like girls, but

428
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,490
if the lesbian is gay,
she likes boys.

429
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,354
She's a gay lesbian.

430
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:23,220
I'm so confused,
does that mean that he is
a straight homosexual?

431
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,704
[kissing]

432
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:39,339
Wait! Wait!

433
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:41,721
What?
I'm not a domestic terrorist!

434
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:45,656
I like where this is going,

435
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:47,624
just not here.

436
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,213
Good idea, your Dad scares me.

437
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:54,493
That just cause you scare him.

438
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:58,669
My place. I have the best view
of the entire city.

439
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,464
Let's go.

440
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:11,889
-Who are they?
-They're nobody.

441
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:17,654
Look who's back... with company.

442
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:20,104
Morgan, this is Misty.
Misty, Morgan.

443
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:22,072
It's nice to meet you, Misty.

444
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:23,729
Where did you find her? Church?

445
00:25:23,763 --> 00:25:24,626
Why church?

446
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:26,490
I'm so sorry, how rude of me.

447
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,768
I'm not used to him bringing
girls home. You know?

448
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:33,635
They're usually anorexic twinks.
Nice to meet you, Morgan.

449
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,361
Let's go.

450
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,087
Hey, Morgan!

451
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,572
Has he taken your wallet yet?

452
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:44,439
Yeah, that's what
swept me off my feet.

453
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:47,718
I want my money tonight
or you're out!

454
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,106
[Super 8 shutter opens]
[camera rolls]

455
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,866
[Morgan]: You live up here?

456
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:01,767
Told you...

457
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,701
Best view of the city.

458
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,602
You impressed, yet?

459
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,225
Where do you pee?

460
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,952
I have four options.

461
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:18,059
How do you poop?

462
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,509
[laughs nervously]

463
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,891
Why do you owe that girl money?

464
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:24,962
Here we go again
with the questions.

465
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:26,136
Sorry, it's a bad habit.

466
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,760
It's the detective in me. Well?

467
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:33,868
I borrowed some money from her
and haven't paid her back yet.
It's no big deal.

468
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:35,421
How much?

469
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:36,456
Seriously?

470
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:38,182
Was it for drugs?

471
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:41,047
Wow. No, it was not for drugs.

472
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,293
It was for, believe it or not,
art school.

473
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,122
You go to art school?

474
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:49,055
I did...

475
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:53,542
for about seven weeks,
but it was a total scam.

476
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:57,167
You wanna go inside?

477
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:59,169
Yeah.

478
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,308
You okay?

479
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:01,481
Yeah.

480
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:03,656
Great,
I just get dizzy sometimes.

481
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,071
You afraid of heights?

482
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:08,696
I love heights!
Let's just go in your palace.

483
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:16,565
Thanks.

484
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,161
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

485
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,543
She is, isn't she?

486
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,857
For the next five minutes,

487
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,135
no more questions.

488
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,554
Just one more?

489
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:42,005
[Jordan laughs]

490
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,249
[sighs]

491
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,631
OK. Ask your question.

492
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,013
Don't you get lonely up here?

493
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:53,223
Not really.

494
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,157
That's a lie.

495
00:27:56,191 --> 00:28:00,299
Looking down,
avoiding eye contact,
tone changes.

496
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,751
All signs of a big fat lie.

497
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:07,858
I'm not lonely right now.

498
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:27,326
[Morgan]
I looked so different back then.

499
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,052
[Jordan]
Way back when you were innocent.

500
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:30,743
[Morgan laughs]
[camera shutter opens]

501
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:32,780
Which brings us to today.

502
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,644
[imitating intercom]
Paging Doctor Colson at the E.R.

503
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:43,998
Maybe we should explain
why we have the doctor
tied up in the closet.

504
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:47,242
We don't want your family
to get the wrong idea.

505
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:52,247
Good thinking.
Doctor, you should
probably watch this too.

506
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:53,662
[camera shutter closes]

507
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:57,528
Told you, it's stupid.

508
00:28:57,563 --> 00:28:59,738
Shut it. I'm reading.

509
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:03,362
[Morgan narrates]
He was falling in love. Madly.

510
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:08,539
But he knew, the queen bee would
never allow them to be together.

511
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:10,541
The dragonfly boy had an idea

512
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:15,788
an idea so great,
he was sure that
the Queen bee would be fooled

513
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:20,689
and the princess of bees
would now be allowed
to love him forever.

514
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:23,865
He flew up to the cupboard,
opened it

515
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,041
and grabbed a jar of honey.

516
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:32,287
I love it. You made this?

517
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:34,807
You really like it?

518
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:38,121
Yes. They're in love.

519
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:44,161
It's just a story,
not even a very good one.

520
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:48,441
Love stories
are the only stories
worth telling.

521
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,236
Why'd you quit art school?

522
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:54,447
You're only good if
you do it their way.

523
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,449
If you play by their rules.

524
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:58,072
My rebel!

525
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:01,592
Are you the
little dragonfly boy?

526
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:04,423
No, you are.

527
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:06,390
I'm the princess bee.

528
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:14,847
I have to go.

529
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,506
Thought you were
staying the night.

530
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,578
You lost the bet, remember?

531
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,752
Good night, princess.

532
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:39,872
[knocking]

533
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,391
Baby?

534
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:50,400
You can't runaway from this.
We need to talk about it.

535
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,127

You need to know how it ends,
don't you?

1588
01:42:42,363 --> 01:42:45,089
So, the dragonfly boy and
his princess bee

1589
01:42:45,124 --> 01:42:49,163
flew as fast as they could
away from the kingdom.

1590
01:42:49,197 --> 01:42:53,443
"Where are we going?"
asked the Princess bee.

1591
01:42:53,477 --> 01:42:57,067
"Wherever we want"
said the dragonfly boy.

1592
01:42:57,101 --> 01:43:00,553
So they went anywhere
and everywhere together.

1593
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:04,902

valleys, thick jungle,

they went everywhere together.

1597
01:43:12,669 --> 01:43:15,741
But soon enough,
word spread

1598
01:43:15,775 --> 01:43:18,019
that the queen
and her army of bees

1599
01:43:18,053 --> 01:43:21,609
were searching for them
all over the world

1600

"Where can we hide? We've been
everywhere together" said the
dragonfly boy sadly.

1602
01:43:32,930 --> 01:43:39,385
The princess bee replied
"I have an idea.
We can get married."

-It was your idea, remember?
-[Morgan gasps for breath]

1604

So they got married,
in the backyard of
a beautiful home.

1605
01:43:50,776 --> 01:43:56,160
"Now, the queen will never
find us!" said the princess bee.

01:43:56,195 --> 01:44:01,269
"Even though we are married,
the Queen and her army will
search for us all over the world

said the dragonfly boy.

1609
01:44:10,623 --> 01:44:14,351

"But now we're married,
