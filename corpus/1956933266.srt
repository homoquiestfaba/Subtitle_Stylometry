168
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,166
Oh, my.

169
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,501
But sort of brilliant.

170
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,903
If you already had
all that candy,

171
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,972
why do you want
to trick-or-treat?

172
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,040
This is, like,
our seed candy, Daph.

173
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,610
You gotta have candy
to make candy.

174
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,581
Like, we'll meet you
at the Corn Maze.

175
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,142
[chuckling] Scoob. We did it.

176
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,612
This is the mother lode.
[laughs raucously]

177
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,183
Scooby Snacks.

178
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:44,720
This totally makes all the itchiness from
the candy drying on our skin worth it.

179
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,631
[both] Phew.

180
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,434
[distant whirring]

181
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:00,169
[both] Hmm?

182
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,207
[both gulp]

183
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:14,584
[gasps] It's like one of those
drones we shot down.

184
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,651
Bleh.

185
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:21,123
[Shaggy] "Tot-alli Frame."

186
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,193
[chuckles]
Totalli Frame, man!

187
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,129
[gasps]

188
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:02,131
Scoob, those pumpkins
are, like,

189
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,235
drinking up a mixture of toxic
waste and concentrated fear gas.

190
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:10,339
Like, we need to get these Scooby Snacks
as far away from here as possible.

191
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,041
[grunts in agreement]

192
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,186
[sinister laughter]

193
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,757
I think we need to get us
out of here, too.

194
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,059
[sinister laughter]

195
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,799
[shivering]

196
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,834
[grunts] Giddy up, Scoob!

197
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,204
Oh, no. You giddy up.

198
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,041
- No. You giddy up.
- No. You giddy up.

199
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,877
- You giddy up.
- No. You giddy up.

[growls]

202
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,126
Okay, we both giddy up.

203
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,096
Double giddy up,
on the double.

204
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,234
[roars]

205
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,640

[both gasp]

207
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,387
[Shaggy] Run, Scoob.

208
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,125

214
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:15,264
Oh. Run. Run!

215
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:20,202
- [all laughing]
- [Sheriff clears throat]

216
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,673
Ever since you kids unmasked
the Trash Monster of Scranton,

217
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,243
it's me who's been warning you
not to mess with law enforcement.

218
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:33,349
I want you kids to remember that whatever
happens next, you brought this on yourselves.

219
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,651
But we caught the villain.

220
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,353
You're in over
your heads on this one.

221
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,956
Just go home
and leave it to the pros.

222
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,893
[whistles]

223
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,063
Jeepers. I hope
we did the right thing.

224
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,496
Of course we did.

225
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:58,507
[chuckles] Thank you
for saving Crystal Cove.

226
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:01,477
Happy Halloween, pardners.

227
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,713
Oh, my gosh. Thank you?

228
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,782
Oh, little girl,
you don't have to do that.

229
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:09,853
It's cool. She wanted to do
it, so I told her it was okay.

230
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,587
Aw, well, thank you both.

231
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:15,658
No problem. I'm Mike.
This little cowpoke is Michelle.

232
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,761
You guys really
did save the town.

233
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,963
You ever need anything,
just ask.

234
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,833
Maybe I'll buy y'all
a caramel corn later on.

235
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,700
Hey, nerds.

236
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,772
Oh, you all turned around?
Wow.

237
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,974
Well, it turns out
these reporters

238
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,609
want to interview you
for capturing the Scarecrow

239
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:39,082
instead of me for being the hottest Grand
Marshal this side of the River Styx.

240
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,017
No accounting for taste.

241
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:45,122
Who? Us? On TV?
[laughs]

242
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:48,091
This could be big, guys.
This could be our moment.

243
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,325
[reporters clamoring]

244
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,494
Please.
One question at a time.

245
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,064
Victoria Hasselbaum from
<i>Newsy McNews Face News.</i>

246
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:57,299
Is this all of you? I was told there
were five. I see less than five.

247
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:58,935
Scooby and Shaggy
were right here.

248
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:02,404
They're always nearby.
Just usually hiding.

249
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,475
- [both panting]
- Those are the ones.

250
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,313
Toxic waste
and fear gas combo.

251
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,651
Like dogs, but pumpkins.
They're pumpkins.

252
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,322
They were like jackals,

253
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:22,759
only they were like
Jack-O'-Lanterns.

254
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,326
Jackal Lanterns.

255
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,963
[whimpering]

256
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,832
Only terrifying.

257
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:31,935
And they're coming this way.
You gotta believe us, man.

258
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:34,805
Have you caught sight of these
Jackal Lanterns? I never heard...

259
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:37,573
Uh... This is
Shaggy and Scooby.

260
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,576
They're, um... really into
the Halloween spirit.

261
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,578
<i>This isn't cosplay, Velma.</i>

262
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,514
<i>Halloween's turned
upside down and inside out.</i>

263
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,417
<i>The pumpkins are trying
to eat the people.</i>

264
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:54,758
We need to go
somewhere to hide.

265
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,260
They're perfectly sane.
From a certain point of view.

266
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,231
They're... they're just wired
up on candy, I think.

267
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:02,899
Excuse me. Excuse me.

268
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:06,169
But does that young man
have an owl stuck to his butt?

269
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:08,537
- [owl hoots]
- Who? Oh, my gosh.

270
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:12,474
They mean you, Mr. Owl.

271
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,044
Okay, tell... tell you what.

272
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,214
Let's do this a little more
formally somewhere else.

273
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,149
It's been a crazy
night and...

274
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:23,987
Velma. This is real. I'm crying wolf here.
You have to believe me.

275
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:25,354
No, I don't!

276
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:26,589
You guys are a mess.

277
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,258
You've eaten
way too much candy,

278
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:29,425
we've already
solved the mystery,

279
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,194
and you're talking nonsense.

280
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:32,595
You guys locked yourselves

281
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,597
in the Mystery Machine
instead of helping.

282
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:36,867
Maybe you can
just skip this part too.

284
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:43,974

Go get cleaned up.

I've got this amazing plan to score

- No, we are not cool here.
- Uh-uh.

toxic flying monster pumpkins?

Jackal Lanterns?

310
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:59,115
We've fought some dumb monsters,
guys, but that's just dumb.

311
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:03,719
Well, I'm not making it up,
so it's reality that's dumb.

312
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,789
Why you gotta be
like that, reality?

313
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:09,525
Well, you said these things were right
on your tail, so where are they now?

314
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:16,598
What if these things turn into
monsters too? Help me out, Scoob.

315
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:19,668
We need to, like, squash
every squash that we see.

[both grunting]

317
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:29,412
[Velma] I mean,
we've been doing this forever.

318
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:34,050
Since we got a pup named Scooby-Doo.
Anyway, we make a heck of a team.

319
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,618
There is no "I" in
Mystery Incorporated.

320
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:39,655
Except for the obvious one.

321
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,791
[Velma] Thank you.

322
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:45,527
They're gonna have to tow the old girl to
the body shop, and the bill ain't pretty.

dishwashing jobs to earn money.

00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:48,224
<i>The Mystery Machine X.</i>

339
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:53,229
Whoa. Electric.
Massive touchscreen.

340
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:57,000
An autoclave.
This thing has it all.

341
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,301
Except a soul.

342
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,774
<i>Hello, Mystery Incorporated.</i>

343
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,776
<i>Welcome to the
Mystery Machine X.</i>

344
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:10,280
<i>Where can I take you on this
invigorating Halloween night?</i>

345
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:13,783
Whoa. And you made the nav
computer look like you.

346
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,288
<i>Better. This actually is me. I'm just
talking to you through the vehicle now.</i>

347
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:21,925
I'm chillin' at home tonight handing
out candy to trick-or-treaters,

348
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:25,028
but I do have a costume.
You're sitting in it.

349
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,231
<i>I'm like a nav computer,
a science resource,</i>

350
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:31,367
<i>and a friend, all wrapped up
in one convenient package.</i>

351
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,404
<i>Being a hologram
is highly entertaining.</i>

352
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,638
<i>Hang on, Nye Riders.</i>

353
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,808
[both gasp]

354
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,752
So you're going to... what?

355
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:52,255
Ride around
and solve mysteries with us?

356
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:54,357
<i>Why not?
It sounds like fun.</i>

357
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:56,625
What about when
trick-or-treaters show up?

358
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,328
Or if you have to go
to the bathroom?

359
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:00,930
<i>Well, there's a real computer
inside this thing too,</i>

360
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:03,433
<i>although it's not
as charming as I am.</i>

361
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,269
<i>Just press the "Bill me now"
button to summon me</i>

362
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:09,405
<i>and "Bill me later"
to switch to autopilot.</i>

363
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:16,279
Wow. This is so generous,
Mr. Nye. Thank you.

364
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:19,782
Fred, we don't have to worry about
fixing the Mystery Machine anymore.

365
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:21,784
This night just
keeps on giving.

366
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:25,488
The Mystery Machine doesn't need fixing.
She said she's gonna be fine.

367
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:27,090
[screaming]

368
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:34,164
- [Fred] What happened?
- It's... it's Victoria Hasselbaum

369
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,166
from <i>Newsy McNews Face News.</i>

370
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:39,701
Something... The pumpkins.
They just came alive and took her.

371
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:41,070
Took her where?

372
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:50,213
[straining]

373
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:55,652
Hank, can you unhitch
this thing from my car?

374
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:58,521
I mean, I don't want to have to
pay double toll on the highway.

375
00:23:58,588 --> 00:23:59,789
[Daphne] Elvira.

376
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:02,492
Oh. Hey, girl.

377
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,929
I just wanted to say that
I love your look. Gaultier?

378
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,363
Oh, Gezundheit.

379
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,898
Same with my scarf.

380
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:11,501
Have you ever considered
mentoring anyone?

381
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:13,702
One of me
is more than enough.

382
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,472
Or so the legends say.
[chuckles]

383
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,208
I don't want
to be you, silly.

384
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:21,878
Just to look and think like
you, but still have free will.

385
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,513
Have you ever
done circus work?

386
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,616
You know? Like,
getting shot out of a cannon,

387
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:28,618
wrestling a bear,
breathing fire...

388
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:32,055
Not officially
for a circus, no.

389
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,823
All right. You're in.

390
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,458
Yes!

391
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:39,562
But remember, you're getting
an education, not a job.

392
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:43,399
First thing you need to know is how
I like my luggage packed into my car.

393
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,772

[both panting]

396
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:06,189
Maybe Daph was right.
Maybe we imagined the whole thing.

397
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,359
- You think so?
- I don't know. Maybe.

398
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,228
I mean, if they were real,
then where did they go?

399
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:13,396
[cackles]

400
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:14,731
Like, zoinks!

401
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:17,500
Oh! Help, Scoob.
I've got a pumpkin butt.

402
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:28,878
- Hello? Miss Hasselbaum?
- It's Mystery Incorporated. We come in peace.

403
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,288
[cackling]

404
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,930
- Uh-oh.
- This is what Shaggy and Scooby were talking about.

405
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:49,832
Is this even possible?

406
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:51,834
- [rustling]
- Huh?

407
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,369
[straining, mumbling]

408
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:58,174
Miss Hasselbaum.
It's me, Fred.

409
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,976
- We're here to rescue you.
- [thudding]

410
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:03,413
[grunts]

411
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,782
[Victoria] My glasses.

412
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:07,450
- I can't see without my glasses.
- [snarling]

413

[screams]

414
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,555
I didn't want to see that.

415
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:16,225
Oh, no. Victoria Hasselbaum.

416
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:19,128

417
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:20,330
[cackles]

418
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,232
This isn't happening.

419
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:24,334

420
00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:28,338
[roaring]

421
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:32,942
[Fred] Run!

422
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:37,547
Fred. This is so dumb. It's the
dumbest monster ever. It can't be real.

423
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:38,981
Oh, I believe you, Velma.

424
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:42,085
[roaring]

425
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,521
I just don't think
my legs do.

426
00:26:46,556 --> 00:26:48,124
- [cackles]
- Oh!

427
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:54,931
[grunting]

428
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,111
[cackling]

429
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:21,924
Wow. You're a regular
Mary Sue.

430
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:24,927
Daphne.
Now step on it, Elvira!

431
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,196
[straining] I'm trying.

432
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:40,076
Parade's back on.

433
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:48,284
Oh, no. They got Hank.

434
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:52,388
They zombified him,
only they pumpkified him.

435
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:58,327
[slurps, snarls]

436
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,531

- [both sigh]
- [electricity crackling]

438
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,389
They turned the power off.

439
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,392
How could they turn the power off?
They're vegetables.

440
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,626
[both panting]

441
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:37,300
[roaring]

442
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:43,172
It's, like, the Alpha
Jackal Lantern.

443
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,546
[both screaming]

444
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:54,650
[motor whirring]

445
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:58,554
Halloween.

446
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:06,295
One more thing I don't like about
that big orange guy. He cheats!

447
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:08,731
Well, if you can't beat 'em...

448
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:13,536
[grunting]

449
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:23,579
[both] Phew.

450
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:24,647
Yeah.

451
00:29:24,714 --> 00:29:26,415
[people screaming]

452
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:41,197
It begs the question,
is this a natural occurrence,

453
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:45,301
or perhaps another problem caused by the
so-called "Information Superhighway"?

454
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,471
[screams]

455
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:02,819
Guys, over here.
Come on.

456
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:09,692
[roaring]

457
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,327

[tires screech]

460
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:30,613
[Elvira] Coming through.

461
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,282
[both sigh]

462
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:36,787
[rumbling]

463
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,491
[both gasp]

464
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,137
Mike. Hey, Mike.
We need your help. Remember me?

465
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:56,405
I'm Fred,
from Mystery Incorporated.

466
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:58,507
Yeah, now's not
a great time, man.

467
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:00,509
It's just that Michelle
said we saved the town,

468
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:03,412
and you said you owed us one
because we saved the town.

469
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,417
Our friends need a ride.

470
00:31:09,352 --> 00:31:11,220
I said caramel corn.

471
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,728
Fine. Get in the back.
Come on.

472
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:32,608
[terrified gasp]

473
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:36,312
Mr. Nye, get us out of here.
Ludicrous speed. Engage.

474
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:56,465
- Huh? [gasps]
- Whoa.

475
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:07,343
You know what's terrifying?
It's so messed up, I'm not even hungry.

476
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,646
Y'all cowpokes want some
of this here licorice?

477
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:12,816
[both] Yes, please.

478
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:19,923
<i>Wow. You guys are having
a wild Halloween.</i>

479
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,026
<i>If I weren't virtually right
here, I'd be jealous.</i>

480
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:25,695
Pumpkins that were mutated
by toxic chemicals

481
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:28,698
and can bite people and turn
them into other pumpkins.

482
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:30,967
In what world
does that make sense?

483
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:34,137
[gasps] She's still back there.
My love.

484
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:37,606
No, Daphne made it out with Elvira.
They're right up ahead.

485
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:40,242
No. No.
The Mystery Machine.

486
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:43,279
We left her back there
all alone.

487
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:45,015
It's okay, Freddy.
We got the X now,

488
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:47,516
and it's got way more tech
than the old one had.

489
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,586
We're gonna crack
this mystery like a gourd.

490
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,258
[purring]

491
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:04,768
Ah, what a hideous night
for a drive.

492
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:06,770
Ah, so hideous.

493
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:09,538
- Is everyone okay?
- [Shaggy] Like, no.

494
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:12,776
Heck no. Look, I don't
even live out this way.

495
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:14,845
It's been a crazy night,
we're all tired,

496
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:18,815
and these guys smell like the bottom
of a trash can in a candy store.

497
00:33:18,882 --> 00:33:20,751
And I kind of have to go.

498
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:23,120
And my little girl
kind of has to go.

499
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:27,289
Sorry, Mike. Let's pull over at the
next exit and we'll sort it all out.

500
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:37,234
We already solved
the Scarecrow mystery.

501
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:41,104
I can't believe that this...
event is a coincidence.

502
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:43,140
It's not.

503
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:46,408
You saw what the toxic waste and the
fear gas did to that pumpkin patch.

504
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:49,012
Did I? What do you think,
Mr. Nye?

505
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,313
Do you have any science-based
wisdom to impart?

506
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,450
<i>Well, Velma, if you stacked
every ruler on Earth,</i>

507
00:33:54,517 --> 00:33:56,585
<i>end-to-end between
the Earth and the Moon,</i>

508
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,155
<i>they would all drift away</i>

509
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:00,456
<i>before you could
measure anything at all.</i>

510
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:06,395
Okay, yeah. I mean science wisdom
that applies to our current situation.

511
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:11,802
<i>Oh. Well, no, then. Nothing yet.
No idea on the pumpkins.</i>

512
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:14,703
<i>The town should definitely
not have collapsed, though.</i>

513
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,605
<i>There are no fault lines
in the area.</i>

514
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:17,941
<i>There was talk of underground</i>

515
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:20,010
<i>lithium mining
a few years back,</i>

516
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:21,544
<i>but it was shut down</i>

517
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,546
<i>over concerns about
the impact on the environment.</i>

518
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:25,614
<i>Hmm. Crystal Cove
gets its name</i>

519
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:28,952
<i>from the stalactite anthodite
crystals in the area's sea caves,</i>

520
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:31,520
<i>but none of those caves
extend this far inland.</i>

521
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:35,826
<i>Anthodite crystals are, by the
way, my sixth favorite crystal.</i>

522
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,837
Daddy's had about enough of
Halloween night. Yes, sir.

523
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:50,339
What the...

524
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:52,408
[cackling]

525
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:53,944
[heavy metal music playing]

526
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,688
No way.

527
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,358
Mr. Nye. More RPMs, please.

528
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:10,927
[both] Whoa.

529
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,099
Hey, I thought
we were stopping.

530
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,068
Speed up. Go, go, go.

531
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:23,039
Really? It's a parade float.

532
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,349
Um... Mentee of the Dark.

533
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:33,783
Yes, Mentor of the Dark.

534
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,584
I don't suppose
you've ever disconnected

535
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:37,486
a parade float
from a car going

536
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,722
eighty miles per hour before,
have you?

537
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:43,193
Um, of course I have.
Do you have a cutting torch?

538
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,728
Duh. Of course I do.

539
00:35:46,997 --> 00:35:48,397
[grunts]

540
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,506
Daph, hurry. The Jackal
Lanterns are coming in fast.

541
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,276
I know what
I'm doing, Freddy.

542
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:00,709
[rattling]

543
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:05,648
Do you want me
to come over there?

544
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:07,683
I think you're supposed
to hold it like...

545
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,386
Frederick Herman Jones.

546
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:13,656
Do not torchsplain to me when
I am carrying a torch for you.

547
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,292
I mean... [grunts]

548
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,693
No, yeah. I'm sorry.
It's just...

549
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,530
- [Daphne grunts]
- No. You do you. You do you.

550
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,100
- [gasps, grunts]
- [tires screech]

551
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,668
[chittering, screaming]

552
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,539
Whoops. Butterfingers.

553
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,542
[metal scraping, clanging]

554
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:46,488
Fire extinguisher?

555
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:53,863
[screams]

556
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:08,577
Ha! The old
"hotsy coldsy" trick.

557
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,847
Nice. Check this one out.

558
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:28,597
Light 'em up, Mr. Nye.

559
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:37,974
[gasping]

560
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:43,712
[all scream]

561
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,587
[laughs]

562
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:54,024
[shudders]

563
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:57,327
[whooping]

564
00:37:57,394 --> 00:37:58,560
- Yes.
- Yeah.

565
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,468
[cackling]

566
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,338
They're still coming?

567
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:11,673
Well, at least we bought
ourselves some breathing room.

568
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:16,012
[sighs] After all that,
I'm starting to wish

569
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,049
there was more breathing
room in this corset.

570
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:21,951
Ooh, ooh. Can I wear it?
Thanks for the assist back there.

571
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:24,854
No problem. But now
we need to solve this mystery.

572
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:26,823
The trouble is,
we can't slow down

573
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,725
to collect clues
with those things chasing us.

574
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:31,895
Do we even know
they're real pumpkins?

575
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:36,166
Mmm. Stringy. Seedy.
Smokey aftertaste.

576
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,633
[slurps]

577
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:41,504
- Mmm.
- [both] Delicious.

578
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,340
Definitely real pumpkins.
[chuckles]

579
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:51,014
The fear gas.
Maybe we've been exposed to it.

580
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,883
<i>Nope. The first thing I did
was check the air quality.</i>

581
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,952
<i>It's remarkably clear
out there.</i>

582
00:38:58,321 --> 00:38:59,956
[groans]

583
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:02,392
Velma, are you scared too?

584
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:04,294
Of course not.

585
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,997
There's got to be a logical solution
to this somewhere in my mind palace.

586
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:10,666
Wow. You live in a palace?

587
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:15,604
No, it's a mind palace.
It's a place I can go in my imagination.

588
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:17,173
It's where I keep
all of my memories

589
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,176
and store the clues
for the cases we solve.

590
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:22,212
Eh. That's not as fun.

591
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:25,248
Normally it's a lot of fun.

592
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:30,954
[groans] I just can't seem
to find anything in here today.

593
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,856
It's because she's scared.

594
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:34,690
Scared? I'm not scared.

595
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:36,658
You sure?

596
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:40,563
Because I can never find what I'm
looking for and I'm scared all the time.

597
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,098
I'm not scared.

598
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:45,135
You can't be scared
of something that isn't real.

599
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:48,438
- But they are real.
- Real pumpkin.

600
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:50,073
But not real monsters.

601
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,042
Aw. There's no shame
in being scared, Velma.

602
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:55,711
Well, good. Because I'm not.

603
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:59,582
Now can everyone be quiet so
I can focus on my mind palace?

604
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,117
[sighs]

605
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:06,688
Now. What do we know
about these Jackal Lanterns?

606
00:40:06,756 --> 00:40:11,060
They can turn people into other monster
pumpkins, like zombies in the movies.

607
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:13,096
Like, they'll eat your pants
right off your butt.

608
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:16,799
Uh-uh. No joke.
Right off your butt.

609
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:18,935
They smash real good.

610
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:23,773
<i>We know that chemicals generally don't
cause mutations this extreme in nature,</i>

611
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,077
<i>so these Jackal Lanterns probably
aren't what they appear to be.</i>

612
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:30,046
"Probably"?

613
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:32,382
You're saying there's a chance these things
are really monster pumpkins for real?

614
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:35,185
<i>As scientists, we can't discount
anything without evidence.</i>

615
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:39,255
<i>Even the seemingly impossible
is possible, technically.</i>

616
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:42,325
Man, I thought science was supposed
to make people feel better.

617
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:47,363
Nope. Science is a means to get to the
truth, and sometimes the truth hurts.

618
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,199
[distant cackling]

619
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:52,902
Right now, truth is that I don't
know what to make of any of this.

620
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,338
[cackling continues]

621
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:57,807
<i>Occam's razor suggests
that the solution</i>

622
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:01,743
<i>requiring the least explanation
is the best solution.</i>

623
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:02,845
<i>Uh, usually.</i>

624
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:04,746
Oh, great.

625
00:41:04,814 --> 00:41:07,684
Pumpkins are tired of getting
smashed, and now they want revenge.

626
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:10,719
And we all fell into their trap
like hair in a drain.

627
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:12,422
[gasps] A trap.

628
00:41:13,189 --> 00:41:14,390
A trap?

629
00:41:14,457 --> 00:41:16,392
Shaggy, I could kiss you.

630
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:18,328
- Oh...
- [chuckles]

631
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:21,130
Whoa. Like,
that escalated fast.

632
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:24,300
Not literally.
But you just reminded me.

633
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:28,137
Dr. Crane said that he and I
were caught in the same trap.

634
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:30,807
I couldn't figure out what he
meant, but... [gasps]

635
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:34,877
Mr. Nye. Step on it.
We need to catch up to the Scarecrow.

636
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:41,351
So you're the sheriff
in these here parts?

637
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:45,154
- Howdy, Sheriff.
- You kids!

638
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:47,023
What are you doing
all the way out here?

639
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,859
Sheriff, we need to speak
to Dr. Crane.

640
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:52,095
Have you completely
lost your minds?

641
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:55,231
It's, like,
about the Jackal Lanterns.

642
00:41:55,298 --> 00:41:56,332
The what?

643
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:59,302
Orange. Freaky.
Aggressive drivers.

644
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:04,841
What is that?
What's happening?

645
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:07,443
Sheriff, please,
we don't have time to explain.

646
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,381
And we can't explain. We just need
you to patch us through to the truck.

647
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:15,118
Look, Crane isn't my prisoner.
He belongs to the Feds.

648
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:17,587
I'm lucky they even
let me drive behind.

649
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:21,424
I'm just trying to have a cool
sheriff moment here, and...

650
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,229
Are those pumpkins
driving cars?

651
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:27,530
[cackling]

652
00:42:33,836 --> 00:42:36,906
- Please, Sheriff.
- What have you done?

653
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:40,476
I gotta call this in.
Don't do anything.

654
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:42,445
[fearful babbling]

655
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:49,886
Mr. Nye, can you think of a way
I can communicate with Dr. Crane?

656
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:53,056
- <i>Of course, I can. I'll just need to check...</i>
- [doorbell ringing]

657
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:56,693
<i>Trick-or-treaters!
Hang on one second.</i>

658
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,895
Wait, what? Mr. Nye?

659
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:00,764
[children] <i>Trick-or-treat!</i>

660
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,701
[Nye] <i>Whoa. All right.
Those are some amazing costumes.</i>

661
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:06,602
<i>In real life,
in order to exist, of course,</i>

662
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,538
<i>Aquaman would
probably need gills.</i>

663
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:11,174
<i>Your version is accurate
to the source material.</i>

664
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,143
<i>But the source material
is somewhat unreliable.</i>

665
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,912
<i>He's handing out candy.</i>

666
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:18,715
Hey. Let's go see Bill Nye.

667
00:43:18,782 --> 00:43:20,383
[siren blaring]

668
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,052
Get out of here, son.
Leave this to law enforcement.

669
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,520
We can help, Sheriff.

670
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:26,489
No. You stay safe.

671
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:28,524
As much as I grumble
at you kids,

672
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:31,594
I feel almost like you're
the only family I've got.

673
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:35,131
But we've only talked,
like, eight or ten times.

674
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:38,167
- [cackling]
- [screaming]

675
00:43:43,906 --> 00:43:45,575
[Sheriff] The horror.

676
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:47,310
Sheriff! No!

677
00:44:01,124 --> 00:44:02,992
Mr. Nye? Hello?

678
00:44:03,993 --> 00:44:05,261
[beeping]

679
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:07,130
[automated voice]
<i>Engaging autopilot.</i>

680
00:44:09,165 --> 00:44:10,666
What are you going to do?

681
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:14,470
[automated voice]
<i>Activating seat adjustment.</i>

682
00:44:18,107 --> 00:44:21,043
<i>Adjusting seat position
to exterior of vehicle.</i>

683
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:25,148
- [beeping]
- [Velma] Whoa!

684
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:33,022
Oh, Bill Nye.
What have you done?

685
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,392
Whoa!

686
00:44:37,828 --> 00:44:39,929
You brilliant, lovable man.

687
00:44:41,631 --> 00:44:43,499
I'm okay.

688
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:46,169
Speak for yourself. Finally found
the flaw in this thing, I guess.

689
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:48,137
[Nye] <i>Well, yes,
but the pressure in Atlantis</i>

690
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:50,808
<i>would have to be over
35,000 kilopascal.</i>

691
00:44:50,874 --> 00:44:53,176
<i>And that's on top
of the social pressures.</i>

692
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:02,685
[growls]

693
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:13,029
You... monsters.

694
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:14,997
[howling]

695
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:17,099
[howling]

696
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:19,635
[giggles] Daddy,
this ride is fun.

697
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:22,906
That's right, baby.
It's all a 3D motion control ride.

698
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:24,140
- None of it's real.
- [cackles]

699
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:26,075
- [grunts]
- [engine revving]

700
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:29,445
Daddy just ate too much pizza and
fell asleep with the TV on again.

701
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:31,681
It's that
pepperoni-<i>Westworld</i> combo.

702
00:45:33,616 --> 00:45:36,787
- Velma's got the right idea, Scoob.
- [thudding]

703
00:45:36,854 --> 00:45:40,623
It's, like, safer in the armored truck.
Time to eject.

704
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:41,959
You guys comin'?

705
00:45:42,024 --> 00:45:43,794
What? Are you
offering me dog treats?

706
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:45,328
Get out of here with that.

707
00:45:47,063 --> 00:45:48,297
[pops]

708
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,778
[giggling]

709
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:03,780
Pepperoni <i>Westworld.</i>

710
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,088
[knocking on door]

711
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,127
Happy Halloween, boys.
I realize that this isn't normal,

712
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,429
but extenuating
circumstances.

713
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:26,369
Don't worry.

714
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:28,704
He's behind three inches
of reinforced laminate.

715
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:31,107
We'll be right here
if you need us.

716
00:46:36,178 --> 00:46:37,713
[both breathe deeply]

717
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:48,691
Ms. Dinkley. I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

718
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:52,128
So, you know who I am now,
Dr. Crane.

719
00:46:52,194 --> 00:46:54,463
I may be the 53rd

720
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,133
most infamous
supervillain in the world,

721
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:00,436
but I'm still
fairly resourceful.

722
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:03,105
[imperceptible]

723
00:47:03,172 --> 00:47:06,843
You weren't in Crystal Cove
to attack Elvira, were you?

724
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,078
What makes you think that?

725
00:47:09,145 --> 00:47:11,380
Motive. You don't seem
like a crazed fan,

726
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:13,749
and you recently escaped
from Arkham Asylum.

727
00:47:13,817 --> 00:47:17,888
Why risk your freedom to attack a
celebrity at a high-profile event?

728
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:24,126
Need I remind you that I am quite mad?
I am also a fan of Elvira.

729
00:47:24,193 --> 00:47:30,232
I did write her a fan mail,
so technically I am both crazed and a fan.

730
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:32,735
[chuckles]
But you are correct.

731
00:47:32,803 --> 00:47:38,075
I had no plans to attack Elvira
or to do anything tonight

732
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,643
other than watch
the Halloween parade.

733
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,913
You said we were
in a trap together.

734
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:47,650
I thought that maybe you were speaking
figuratively, but you weren't, were you?

735
00:47:47,717 --> 00:47:49,318
Tell me...

736
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:52,990
Are you frightened yet?

737
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:54,825
- No.
- [both trembling]

738
00:47:54,891 --> 00:48:00,296
You said that fear was an irrational
reaction. You are incorrect.

739
00:48:00,363 --> 00:48:02,899
Fear is ancient.
Primordial.

740
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:09,405
Fear knows the answer
before you do, Ms. Dinkley.

741
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:12,843
So, yes.
I was speaking figuratively.

742
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:17,513
But we are also both
in a very literal trap,

743
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,315
as I'm sure you've surmised

744
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:24,320
based on the nature of this
unusually desperate little visit.

745
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:28,959
But, dude, who would be out to get
the Scarecrow and the Scooby gang?

746
00:48:29,026 --> 00:48:33,529
It's true that we do not seem
to have anything in common,

747
00:48:33,596 --> 00:48:37,768
but logic dictates that
there must be a link.

748
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,603
Someone went
to a great deal of effort

749
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,976
to track me down
and to lead you to me.

750
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:49,846
Do you think this is all linked
to the "Jackal Lanterns"?

751
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:52,615
- The what?
- [loud crash]

752
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,826
[cackling]

753
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:07,496
Mr. Nye, this is Fred.
Come in, Mr. Nye. Over.

754
00:49:07,563 --> 00:49:09,166
[Nye] <i>...and that's on top
of the social pressures.</i>

755
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:11,667
<i>You know, dolphins have
kind of a mean streak...</i>

756
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:14,004
[man] <i>Seriously, Mr. Nye.
Thanks again.</i>

757
00:49:14,071 --> 00:49:17,808
<i>It's past their bedtimes now,
so maybe we could just wrap this up.</i>

758
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:21,778
[Nye] <i>Oh, no. No problem.
Have a happy Halloween, everyone.</i>

759
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:25,715
[sighs] Great.
Power steering's gone.

760
00:49:25,782 --> 00:49:30,987
This thing is tight!
Hey, we should just switch outfits.

761
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:33,123
Why?

762
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,226
Think about it. You're famous, so naturally
the monsters will try to eat you first.

763
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:40,463
If I'm dressed like you,
I can act as bait while you stay safe.

764
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:44,968
I've heard of being hungry for
fame, but this is ridiculous.

765
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:46,635
- [cackles]
- [window squeaks]

766
00:49:46,702 --> 00:49:49,638
All right. I'm up for anything.
Give me your scarf.

767
00:49:49,705 --> 00:49:50,841
- [cackling]
- Huh?

768
00:49:50,907 --> 00:49:51,875

[yells] And this whole
thing's electric.

781
00:50:52,202 --> 00:50:54,436
Game over, man.
Game over.

782
00:50:54,503 --> 00:50:55,872
Ha! Found the flaw.

- Daddy?
- Yeah, baby.

786
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:04,613
Now I really have to go.

787
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,658

Come on. Hurry.

792
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,949
Get in the car, Velma.

793
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:41,318
I can't leave
Dr. Crane in there.

794
00:51:41,383 --> 00:51:44,720
Yeah, you can. It's easy.
I already did it.

795
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,562

I love your work.
Big fan.

Oh, with an outfit like that,
you'd better be.

825
00:55:05,288 --> 00:55:07,824
No!

826
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:10,927
Phew.

00:55:44,726 --> 00:55:47,797
[sighs] I'm sorry, everyone.
I failed.

836
00:55:47,864 --> 00:55:49,399
What are you talking
about, Velma?

837
00:55:49,466 --> 00:55:53,635
I got cocky after we captured
Scarecrow. Before, even.

838
00:55:53,702 --> 00:55:55,772
Like the Sheriff said,
he's been warning us

839
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:00,110
that we're in over our heads since we
caught the Trash Monster of Scranton.

840
00:56:00,176 --> 00:56:02,579
The poor Sheriff.

841
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:06,583
I assumed we couldn't fail,
and that I couldn't make a mistake.

842
00:56:06,648 --> 00:56:09,786
Because of that,
I didn't listen to Scooby and Shaggy.

843
00:56:09,853 --> 00:56:11,620
Now we've had someone
arrested for a crime

844
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:15,225
they didn't commit, and we're no
closer to solving this mystery.

845
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:17,227
And we lost a shoe
and some good luggage.

846
00:56:17,293 --> 00:56:19,329
And we're on the run
for our lives.

847
00:56:19,395 --> 00:56:22,731
It's these dumb Jackal Lanterns.
They're unstoppable.

848
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,468
That's not true.
We've stopped a lot of them.

849
00:56:25,535 --> 00:56:26,970
They smash real good.

850
00:56:27,036 --> 00:56:29,439
Yeah, but there are
so many of them.

851
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:33,843
And that alpha pumpkin seems to disrupt
anything electrical that gets near it.

852
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,678
We don't need gadgets, Velma.
We have me.

853
00:56:36,745 --> 00:56:38,181
What are you going
to do, Freddy?

854
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:40,583
I'm going to do
what I do best.

855
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:42,986
I'm gonna do traps.

856
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:19,122
[distant howling and cackling]

857
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:24,827
[battle cry]

858
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:41,844
Ugh. These Jackal Lanterns
are like a force of pure chaos

859
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:44,614
that resists every attempt
to apply order.

860
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:49,953
If I can just get a few quiet minutes in my
mind palace, maybe I can puzzle this out.

861
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:52,689
Well, if Scoob and I
were in your mind palace,

862
00:57:52,755 --> 00:57:54,190
we'd help you look.

863
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:56,559
And I'd be the handsome
prince who lived there.

864
00:57:56,626 --> 00:58:00,997
[chuckles] I wish I could take
you two into my mind palace.

865
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:03,166
We'd just break something.

866
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:07,637
Seriously. Sometimes I think I don't
appreciate what you guys bring to the table.

867
00:58:07,704 --> 00:58:11,941
We wouldn't have a Scooby gang
without a Shaggy and a Scooby.

868
00:58:13,343 --> 00:58:16,045
- Well, there is a way.
- A way to what?

869
00:58:16,112 --> 00:58:18,514
A way we can join you
in your mind palace.

870
00:58:19,649 --> 00:58:21,451
[Scooby-Doo reading]

871
00:58:21,517 --> 00:58:22,418
Scooby Snacks?

872
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,554
[Scooby-Doo gulps]

873
00:58:24,621 --> 00:58:26,289
What are you... [sputtering]

874
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:30,927
Hey. These actually
aren't bad.

875
00:58:30,994 --> 00:58:32,695
Scooby Snacks
bring people together.

876
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:35,164
And they're delicious.

877
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:37,433
And now that we've all shared
Scooby Snacks together,

878
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,770
a part of us will be right there with
you when you go to your happy place.

879
00:58:40,837 --> 00:58:42,939
- Mind palace.
- That too.

880
00:58:43,006 --> 00:58:45,842
Thanks for the gesture, guys.
It was really sweet.

881
00:58:45,908 --> 00:58:49,879
Okay, think, Velma.
Think like your life depends on it.

882
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:05,261
Okay, Ms. Dinkley.
Time to review the facts.

883
00:59:05,328 --> 00:59:07,263
- Like, for some reason I thought there was going...
- [yelps]

884
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,032
...to be a lot more
math floating around.

885
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:12,068
You guys are really
in my mind palace?

886
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:16,506
- As advertised.
- It's the Mystery Machine.

887
00:59:16,572 --> 00:59:19,409
Weird. Your mind palace looks
like the Mystery Machine.

888
00:59:19,475 --> 00:59:21,911
For some reason I thought
it was gonna be a hobbit hole.

889
00:59:21,978 --> 00:59:23,746
Yeah. Nerd stuff.

890
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:25,581
It can look like
anything you want it to.

891
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:28,851
I guess this is just where
I feel the most comfortable.

892
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:30,520
So, like, what do we do?

893
00:59:30,586 --> 00:59:33,423
We just drive through
my memory and look for clues.

894
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:35,992
Let's start with
the Halloween parade.

895
00:59:39,295 --> 00:59:40,363
[crashing]

896
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:44,567
Drive a little further.

897
00:59:47,437 --> 00:59:48,404
Stop!

898
00:59:51,507 --> 00:59:56,346
Scarecrow's equipment.
He said it was stolen from Toe Omni-Tech.

899
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,318
Hmm.

900
01:00:02,786 --> 01:00:04,087
Huh?

901
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,228
Hmm.

902
01:00:12,295 --> 01:00:13,596
Imaginary.

903
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:15,732
Oh.

904
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:17,367
Come on. We need to hurry.

905
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,311
Oh, boy. [nervous laugh] This is
starting to creep me out, man.

906
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,179
Like, we shouldn't have come.

907
01:00:30,246 --> 01:00:32,715
Shaggy, Scooby.
You were in the pumpkin patch too.

908
01:00:32,783 --> 01:00:34,050
What did you see?

909
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:41,457
We, like, saw
the Totalli Frame drones here

910
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:43,693
and then the pumpkins
started to come to life.

911
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:45,595
Totalli Frame?

912
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:49,565
Yeah. That's what it said on the side.
It was spelled all funny. See?

913
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:51,734
Ah. Totalli Frame.

914
01:00:51,802 --> 01:00:54,070

- How'd the mind tricks go?
- Mind palace. And not great.

917
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:13,256
These things aren't real.
I just can't prove it yet.

918
01:01:13,322 --> 01:01:15,793
I have no doubt that science
will prevail eventually,

919
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:19,028
but there's something I
trust even more than science.

920
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:22,698
- Bazookas?
- No, silly. It's you guys.

921
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:27,236
Now let's go smash
some pumpkins.

to Shaggy and Scooby.

[Scooby-Doo] Hmm?

962
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,668
Shaggy and Scooby noticed

963
01:04:45,735 --> 01:04:48,537
that the Scarecrow's drones
had some writing on them.

964
01:04:48,604 --> 01:04:50,539
Shaggy thought
it said "Totalli Frame,"

965
01:04:50,606 --> 01:04:55,411
but the "Al" and the "Li" were written
like elements on the periodic table.

Aluminum and lithium.

967

The text actually read
"TOT Aluminum Lithium Frame,"

968
01:05:01,617 --> 01:05:05,655
meaning that the drone itself was
made from a lightweight lithium alloy.

something heavy like Scarecrow's gas tanks.</i>

turned into pumpkins?

hadn't known what I was getting into.

So that weird Scarecrow guy
did it after all.

985
01:05:52,803 --> 01:05:55,806
No. Dr. Crane
was telling us the truth.

986

He was framed to draw
us in and distract us.

987

Distract us from what?

988
01:06:00,643 --> 01:06:03,880

Crystal Cove is rich in lithium.

have run under Crystal Cove,</i>

said it would damage the environment.</i>

Oh, man. Like the town
square collapsing.

That's right.

993
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:17,994
Someone decided to mine
the lithium anyway,

994
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:20,629
and engineered this whole
mess to cover it up.

enough that he can push our buttons.

01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:30,100
<i>That's right.</i>

1020
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:32,401
<i>Once you exposed my plan
to make everyone think</i>

1021
01:07:32,468 --> 01:07:36,505
<i>a trash monster was causing
pollution instead of Toe Omni-Tech,</i>

1022
01:07:36,572 --> 01:07:40,010
<i>I went to jail and lost
half my stock.</i>

1023
01:07:40,076 --> 01:07:41,244
<i>To make things worse,</i>

1024
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:42,946
<i>scientists said
my lithium mine</i>

1025
01:07:43,013 --> 01:07:45,282
<i>was going to pollute
the environment,</i>

1026
01:07:45,347 --> 01:07:47,150
<i>so I lost that too.</i>

1027
01:07:47,217 --> 01:07:49,618
<i>In prison, I'd learned
that Dr. Jonathan Crane,</i>

1028
01:07:49,685 --> 01:07:52,956
<i>AKA the Scarecrow,
was a fan of my tech.</i>

1029
01:07:53,023 --> 01:07:57,027
<i>So I did what anyone
in my situation would do.</i>

1030
01:07:57,093 --> 01:08:00,096
<i>I spent my remaining millions
to amass an army of drones</i>

1031
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:04,835
<i>and moved to Crystal Cove to
impersonate a local Sheriff.</i>

1032
01:08:05,634 --> 01:08:07,103
<i>I used my position</i>

1033
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,538
<i>as an authority figure
to get under your skins.</i>

1034
01:08:09,605 --> 01:08:12,943
<i>I'd tell you that you were breaking
the law to wear down your confidence,</i>

1035
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:16,478
<i>and then tell you I supported
you to build it back up.</i>

1036
01:08:16,545 --> 01:08:18,815
[Daphne] <i>The old
"hotsy coldsy" trick.</i>

1037
01:08:18,882 --> 01:08:20,616
[Cutler Toe]
<i>Once the trap was set,</i>

1038
01:08:20,683 --> 01:08:23,719
<i>all I had to do was unleash
my robotic drills.</i>

1039
01:08:23,787 --> 01:08:26,890
<i>The robots would extract millions
of dollars worth of lithium</i>

1040
01:08:26,957 --> 01:08:28,557
<i>while I chased everyone
out of town</i>

1041
01:08:28,624 --> 01:08:30,359
<i>with my pumpkin drones.</i>

1042
01:08:30,426 --> 01:08:33,096
<i>And made you kids
look like fools.</i>

1043
01:08:33,163 --> 01:08:36,465
And I'll bet the toxic waste
wasn't even toxic waste.

1044
01:08:36,532 --> 01:08:40,502
[Cutler Toe] <i>Thanks to you, I'm not
allowed to have real toxic waste anymore.</i>

1045
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:44,040
<i>So I spent another million
dollars to buy green glow sticks</i>

1046
01:08:44,107 --> 01:08:46,877
<i>and I snapped them
all into that tanker truck.</i>

1047
01:08:46,943 --> 01:08:48,979
And you might've
gotten away with it too,

1048
01:08:49,045 --> 01:08:51,513
if it weren't for these
friends of mine.

1049
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,883
Friendship's O-P.

1050
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:55,785
<i>Well, whatever.
Go ahead and celebrate.</i>

1051
01:08:55,852 --> 01:08:59,521
<i>Even you baby geniuses
can't arrest a hologram.</i>

1052
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:03,126
The real Cutler Toe
is in a very fast sportscar

1053
01:09:03,193 --> 01:09:06,729
packed with more money
than you dweebs will ever see

1054
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:09,032
in your combined lifetimes.

1055
01:09:09,099 --> 01:09:11,433
I could be halfway
to Guam by now.

1056
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,270
Not even the Feds
can catch me.

1057
01:09:13,336 --> 01:09:14,938
We'll see about that.

1058
01:09:15,005 --> 01:09:17,107
Right? What do you think,
Mr. Nye?

1059
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:18,909
Did we keep him
talking long enough?

1060
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,643
<i>Perfect, Velma.</i>

1061
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:23,780
<i>He's headed southbound,
still on Highway 13 by the Oak exit.</i>

1062
01:09:25,882 --> 01:09:30,053
Hope that sportscar is as
swift as justice, Mr. Toe.

1063
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,155
<i>No! No!</i>

1064
01:09:37,227 --> 01:09:39,296
[Malarkey]
That's Toe's car, all right.

1065
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:41,164
He couldn't have gotten far.

1066
01:09:41,231 --> 01:09:43,465
Come on, it's not like someone
could just swoop in and grab him.

1067
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:45,434
[crows cawing]

1068
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:47,037
[engine sputtering]

1069
01:09:51,141 --> 01:09:53,910
[Elvira] Well, at least if the dead
ever come out of this graveyard,

1070
01:09:53,977 --> 01:09:56,679
they'll have a lot of
dead cars to choose from.

1071
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:01,851
I can't believe it.
I think they're all wrecked.

1072
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:15,564
[groans] These shoes
are the real monsters.

1073
01:10:15,631 --> 01:10:17,367
Well, they say
that the best way

1074
01:10:17,434 --> 01:10:20,636
to get to know someone is to
walk a mile in their shoes,

1075
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:22,906
young Mentee of the Dark.

1076
01:10:23,605 --> 01:10:24,841
[sighs]

1077
01:10:24,908 --> 01:10:27,243
It is a nice night
for a walk.

1078
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,412
Yeah, I'm not complaining.

1079
01:10:29,478 --> 01:10:30,847
Like, me either, Scoob.

1080
01:10:30,914 --> 01:10:33,482
All that sitting
and screaming wears you out.

1081
01:10:33,549 --> 01:10:35,285
Yeah, makes you hungry.

1082
01:10:35,352 --> 01:10:39,089
Hey, guys, check it out.
I did not lead us astray.

1083
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:40,357
Civilization.

1084
01:10:40,423 --> 01:10:44,894
Dude. You are a lifesaver.
For real this time.

1085
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:48,098
I'm... I'm still not sure I ever
want to see you again, though.

1086
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:50,166
Happy trails, partner.

1087
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:52,068
Keep in touch, Mike.

1088
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:55,772
I don't think Calamity Jane here
would let me have it any other way.

1089
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:06,016
Hey! You guys looking
for the Halloween party?

1090
01:11:06,082 --> 01:11:09,786
No. We don't have perfect costumes.
Can't you see that?

1091
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:13,356
Oh. Well, I thought you guys were
dressed like those kids from the news.

1092
01:11:13,423 --> 01:11:15,524
The Mystery Teens
or whatever.

1093
01:11:15,591 --> 01:11:17,659
[Fred] Uh,
Mystery Incorporated.

1094
01:11:17,726 --> 01:11:20,296
Yeah, man.
Anyway, come on in.

1095
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:21,697
We don't have an invitation.

1096
01:11:21,765 --> 01:11:23,967
Uh, well, good,
'cause we didn't make any.

1097
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:25,734
[laughing]
Is there food?

1098
01:11:25,802 --> 01:11:28,905
Only if you count the sandwich
tray, cheese fountain,

1099
01:11:28,972 --> 01:11:30,739
the cookie station,
the ice cream bar,

1100
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:33,510
Uncle Ernie's hot wings,
and the taco truck.

1101
01:11:38,848 --> 01:11:41,851
I can also make you some
pizza bagels if you want...

1102
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:48,557
[laughs]

1103
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:52,962
- What do you think, gang?
- Dancing? Looks like fun to me. I'm in.

1104
01:11:53,029 --> 01:11:57,133
I know I shouldn't ask, but,
really... can I have the wig?

1105
01:11:58,535 --> 01:12:00,537
It's not a wig.

1106
01:12:00,602 --> 01:12:05,308
Daphne, have you been trying to get
Elvira's outfit as a costume all along?

1107
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,843
No.

1108
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:10,547
But that's a great idea.
Now we can go to this party.

1109
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:15,717
Wait. Were you just trying to replace
Elvira and take over her life?

1110
01:12:15,785 --> 01:12:17,353
She's done this before.

1111
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,889
[chuckles nervously]

1112
01:12:19,956 --> 01:12:26,262
We once solved three mysteries with Phyllis
Diller before we even figured it out.

1113
01:12:26,329 --> 01:12:32,634
You are one weird kid. And I'm
proud to be your Mentor of the Dark.

1114
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:34,804
It's not a wig.

1115
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:37,340
It's a macaque.

1116
01:12:37,407 --> 01:12:39,809
- [screeches]
- And her name is Meredith.

1117
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:43,612
Go ahead. Put her on.
You've earned her.

1118
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,184
After the day we've had, I'm not
even gonna ask. You coming, Elvira?

1119
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:52,322
Nah. I'm afraid I'm due back
at my usual haunt.

1120
01:12:52,388 --> 01:12:54,524
Well, thanks again.
See you around.

1121
01:12:54,591 --> 01:12:57,293
Every couple of hours,
just stick a piece of fruit

1122
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,462
or some nuts up in there.

1123
01:12:59,529 --> 01:13:04,901
And, like, maybe if you find a cockroach
or snail. But those are sometimes foods.

1124
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,170
Got it.
You're the best, Elvira.

1125
01:13:07,237 --> 01:13:09,339
I know.

1126
01:13:09,405 --> 01:13:13,009
Well, there you have it,
my children of the night.

1127
01:13:13,076 --> 01:13:15,512
The true story
of the fourth weirdest

1128
01:13:15,578 --> 01:13:19,315
Halloween night I've ever had.
And what have we learned?

1129
01:13:19,382 --> 01:13:22,619
That friendship
is stronger than monsters.

1130
01:13:22,684 --> 01:13:25,321
That there's an answer
to every mystery.

1131
01:13:25,388 --> 01:13:30,193
And that there is nothing
to fear, but fear itself.

1132
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:33,163
And maybe this.

1133
01:13:35,298 --> 01:13:37,066
[distorted voice]
Happy Halloween.

1134
01:14:25,348 --> 01:14:26,482
[laughing]

1135
01:14:27,784 --> 01:14:30,787
Ah. Ooh.

1136
01:14:34,357 --> 01:14:35,225
Ooh.

1137
01:15:38,821 --> 01:15:40,189
[sobbing]

1138
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:02,178
[heart thumping]

1139
01:16:02,245 --> 01:16:05,548
- She's alive. She's alive!
- [thunder crackling]

1140
01:16:09,052 --> 01:16:11,454
[Scooby-Doo]
<i>Scooby-Dooby-Doo!</i>
