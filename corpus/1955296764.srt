1
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,761
Leave me alone!

2
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,853
Get out!

3
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,527
Ghosts-

4
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,461
I guess everyone lives with 'em.

5
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,299
Some good, some bad.

6
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,570
But memories won't let you forget.

7
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,243
They have a way
of boomeranging...

8
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,907
changing a life forever.

9
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,531
There you go!

10
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,948
Maddog taught us about magic.

11
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:06,884
Said he talked with God,
and God told him where to find it.

12
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,324
- And we went there...
- Come here, Josh.

13
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:15,390
once a week and just stared
at the blue skies...

14
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,834
blinded by the sun.

15
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,298
We smiled...

16
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,308
waiting for a miracle...

17
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,944
waiting for the rainmaker.

18
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,984
It's way over there.
That's it.

19
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,958
Remember, water.
Don't be scared, Josh.

20
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,829
Lookit, Dad!
See it coming!

21
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,506
Okay, now.
Here it comes. Duck!

22
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,058
You're listening to KMJQ
Houston-Galveston.

23
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,158
Magic 102 FM is beamed to you
on your radio. You're looking good.

24
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,669
Magic weather, it's gonna be
sunny and hot this afternoon.

25
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,830
We're expecting a high of 90.

26
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:31,138
Right now in Galveston it's 89 degrees.
It's 88 in Third Ward...

27
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,739
and it's 90 right now
at Magic 102 FM.

28
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,038
Mama'd say...

29
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,509
Vietnam drove Maddog crazy.

30
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,612
She'd say when he lost his leg...

31
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,616
he lost his mind.

32
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,311
Maddog!

33
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,582
- The proper command is-
- Cease fire!

34
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,824
- But I wanted to love him.
- Come here and give your daddy a hug.

35
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,330
- I wanted the magic back.
- Whoa! God, you're getting big!

36
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,230
How you feeling?

37
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,395
- All right.
- You're fine? How's your mama doing?

38
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,336
She's fine.

39
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,465
Baby take care of your mama,
don't you?

40
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,736
You know we're gonna be
a family again.

41
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,173
Josh!

42
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,750
Y'all boys want to get
some ice cream?

43
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,218
Yeah. Josh, you want some ice cream?
That's a good idea.

44
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,821
Maddog, stop.
You're hurting him.

45
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,261
Don't worry about it, okay?

46
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,541
We'll have some ice cream
another day, okay?

47
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,705
- You got some money in your pocket?
- Nah. This for me?

48
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,407
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

49
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,211
You know you're not supposed to leave
the house without money in your pocket.

50
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,844
- Can I have some?
- Watch it!

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,321
Come here!
Don't try to steal stuff from me, boy!

52
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,221
Why, I'll kill you!

53
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,524
Stop, Maddog!

54
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,496
Who you messing with, boy?

55
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,780
You don't never disrespect
a man's property.

56
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,373
You always give a man his proper.

57
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,484
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,494
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,060
Jason!

60
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,499
Tell your mama I love her,
all right?

61
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,308
Night, Maddog.

62
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,948
Josh and Maddog never got along.

63
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,154
Could never get used to
the mood swings.

64
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,856
He thought Maddog was shit
'cause that's how he treated Mama.

65
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,287
I knew that made Maddog kinda sad.

66
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,439
Watch out there.
Look, Fast Fred!

67
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,668
I won, man. I won!

68
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,006
- What's up?
- What's up, Josh, Jason?

69
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,138
- What you doing?
- Nothing, man. Just doing that.

70
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,205
- Do a dance, Fred.
- Oh, baby.

71
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,217
Go, Fast.

72
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:07,024
The master.
Neighborhood won't hold me.

73
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,220
- All right.
- I'm outta here, baby.

74
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,422
Coming up with news and sports
in just a little while.

75
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,057
We'll be talking about Jimmy Carter
firing a couple of cabinet members-

76
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,567
- You're gonna get us in trouble!
- Oh, yeah?

77
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,160
Man, gimme the ball back!

78
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,839
I'm gonna take that ball.

79
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,265
Come on, baby!

80
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,937
- Go home, Maddog!
- You can see me out here.

81
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,844
- I'm telling you, go home!
- I love you.

82
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,744
About once a week like clockwork...

83
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,220
Maddog came by.

84
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,817
His knock was always heavy, like
a wounded fist hitting a hollow wall.

85
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,090
Mama always acted unaffected...

86
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,495
but we knew she was afraid-

87
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,535
afraid of what he might do
with the chain unlocked.

88
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,194
Mama!

89
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,862
You okay?

90
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,407
- He didn't get in, did he?
- No, baby.

91
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,103
You all go and get washed up for dinner.
It'll be ready in a minute.

92
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,270
Mama, I'll set the table.

93
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,442
- All right, sugar.
- Okay.

94
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,215
- Why can't he leave us the fuck alone?
- Joshua, you watch your mouth!

95
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,723
- Jay, go see after your brother.
- Okay. Josh!

96
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,090
Calm down, Josh.
Come back here.

97
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,523
You gotta learn to watch your mouth.

98
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,760
I know Mama didn't mean no harm.

99
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,667
She's probably in a bad mood.

100
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,570
You gonna learn
to watch your mouth?

101
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,938
I know that Maddog made you mad.

102
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,068
He ain't nothing but a drunk.

103
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,011
He didn't always
used to be like this.

104
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,174
He used to do
a lot of special things with us.

105
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,976
- I guess you was too young.
- Do you think Mama ever loved him?

106
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,517
Yeah.
I mean, they loved each other.

107
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,228
Everything's gonna be all right.

108
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,102
I promise.

109
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,102
Gloria.

110
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,387
Marry me.

111
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,331
Come here.

112
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,680
I can't do this no more.
You gotta marry me.

113
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,130
Can't you see I'm begging?

114
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,864
- A man ain't a man...
- Get out!

115
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,498
unless he takes care of his wife...

116
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,133
and kid.

117
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,802
Got to remember that.

118
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,299
Gloria!

119
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,308
Open up the door!

120
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,849
Maddog, go home.

121
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,982
Come on, baby. I got something for you.
Just come on and open up the door.

122
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,928
- No, please, just go home.
- Please, baby. Please.

123
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,160
- Open up the door.
- I don't want nothing you got.

124
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,398
Come on.
Open up the door.

125
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,901
Open up the goddamn door!

126
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,907
What's wrong with you?
I got some flowers.

127
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,176
I don't want what you've got.

128
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,849
I don't whatever it is you've got.

129
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,120
- Take the goddamn flowers!
- No!

130
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,857
- Marry me.
- No.

131
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,867
I ain't gonna marry you.

132
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,399
It's my leg, right?

133
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,439
Go on and say it.

134
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,804
It's my leg. Say it.

135
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:31,914
It ain't got nothing to do
with your leg, okay?

136
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,714
- I told you.
- I ain't man enough for you?

137
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,381
Stop it, okay? Stop it!

138
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,117
Damn it, stop it!

139
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,795
Leave me alone!

140
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,238
Get out!

141
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,569
Get out! Just get out!

142
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,553
- Morning, Mama.
- Morning, Jason.

143
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,164
Fixing to go.

144
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,724
Drive careful.

145
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,599
Get him home safe.

146
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,373
I see you didn't forget the way.

147
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,002
Nigger, I done drove this road
four times.

148
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,070
Yeah.
Well, four times is a charm.

149
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,911
I thought it was three.

150
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,008
Man, you know niggers in the wards
can't count.

151
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,610
Well, you better count your blessings,
'cause once again...

152
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,316
Mama's letting your black ass
come home.

153
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,959
Come on.

154
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,556
102 JAMZ you got your super-duper D.J.,
the Mickey D. Mad Hatter, G.

155
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,965
Got to send those phat shout-outs
to South Pork...

156
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,300
Sunnyside, the homeys in the Nickel,
better known as the Fifth Ward.

157
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,671
102 JAMZ.

158
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,426
Man, this is my world!

159
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,022
The Bottoms!

160
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,194
Man, this shit ain't got
nothing to do with the world.

161
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,136
That's why I'm gonna get me a job
and get up out of here.

162
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,702
What?

163
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,176
Elmo's got a cousin in Dallas...

164
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,181
trying to hook me up in a management
training position for this chain.

165
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,816
You leaving?

166
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,655
Don't know yet.

167
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,592
Nigger,
you ain't gonna go no place.

168
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,224
Hey, it's Fast Fred!

169
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,423
Yo, pull over, man.
It's Fast Freddy right there.

170
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,468
Watermelons!
Come on, get your watermelons!

171
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,871
Yo, Freddy!

172
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,672
Yo, Josh!
What's up? You out, man?

173
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,371
Well, hell, yeah.
Say, do a dance for me, man.

174
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,142
No problem. I know you're gonna
hook me up once I'm finished.

175
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,183
Still the master, I tell you.

176
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,881

00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,039
- Excuse me.
- Hey, no problem.

185
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,237
- Don't let me cramp your style.
- I ain't fronting on you.

186
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,439
You got to audition
for Cats, baby.

187
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,038

188
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,243

191
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,259

192
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,386
- Hey, man, let's go get some groceries.
- Oh, yeah.

193
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,727
Let's take the top off this bitch.

194
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,732
This is how we do it.
Ready?

195
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,636
Come on, man!

196
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,442
- Look at this.
- Don't leave that wrapper in my car.

197
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,478
You know I got to keep my ride fresh
for the honeys.

198
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,342
- This nigger's always eating.
- Goddamn right.

199
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,508
Nigger, you eat so much trash,
ain't no wonder you're full of shit.

200
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,519
Yeah, I eat a lot of trash.
I eat a lot of pussy too.

201
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,750
A luxury your ass couldn't afford
in the penitentiary.

202
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,589
You remember your old girl
when you went in? Wanna smell her pussy?

203
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,162
Have your ass home
by 8:00 though.

204
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,175
Not a minute later.

205
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,341
Surprise!

206
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,775
Surprise, baby! Surprise.

207
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,844
Hey! All right!

208
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,815
"Welcome home, Joshua."

209
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,792
Oh, man.

210
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,130
Oh, shit.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

211
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,725
Have some cake, man.

212
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,401
Have some cake, nigger!

213
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,268
Damn! What's happening, baby?

214
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,404
Hey, man, come on.
You done had a little too much to drink.

215
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,541
- No, I'm cool, man.
- Come on, man.

216
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,984
I got you, man. Hold on.
Don't trip, now. Come on.

217
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,988
Sorry, Miss Alexander.

218
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,930
Hey, man.

219
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,838
Goddamn, a party, man.

220
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,874
Was there a bitch in that cake?

221
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,749
Just go to sleep, man.

222
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,350
Hey, where you all going?
Where's everybody going?

223
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,292
Come on.
There's a party going on here.

224
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,593
Come on. You all don't go nowhere.
Watch out. Let me turn this music on.

225
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,135
Aw, come on, Mama.

226
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:44,107
You got to dance!
You've got to get up!

227
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,106
Let's go.
Come on, now.

228
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,114
Al Green, Mama.

229
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,286
- Come on! You got to dance.
- lt'll be all right.

230
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,153
Oh, go ahead
with your bad self.

231
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,769
Come on, y'all.

232
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,115
Gloria, open the door.

233
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,854
Open the goddamn door!

234
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,417
No! Stop it!

235
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,591
Leave me alone!

236
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,034
I see you still up early
'cause you having them dreams...

237
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,402
ain't you, boy?

238
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:29,070
You don't need to worry about
my problems. You need to get a job.

239
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,513
I'll get a fucking job
when I'm ready.

240
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,549
Hey, fuck you, man. I'm not gonna
put Mama through this shit no more.

241
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,649
What you need to do
is get off that goddamn bottle.

242
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:46,027
What I need is to get you
off my goddamn back.

243
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,656
Didn't you learn nothing in prison?

244
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,668
Damn!

245
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,202
That's what I learned.

246
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,846
Hey, Josh.
Hold up, man.

247
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,907
Hey, man. I'm here to help.

248
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,886
You know, you just say the word,
and we're cool.

249
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,418
Done.

250
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,119
We cool?

251
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,529
You gonna do right, man?

252
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,196
Yeah.

253
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,308
Come on, Josh. You're lollygagging
like you're constipated.

254
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,175
You know you got
some chickens to pluck.

255
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,853
Yo, this shit ain't me, man.

256
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,750
Wearing a uniform.

257
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,952
Saluting some French cook.

258
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,760
I know it ain't the dope.
It's nine to five.

259
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,193
Mama done begged the man to get you
this job. Just do it for Mama, okay?

260
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,312
102 JAMZ. I thought only I was hot
in this city, but I know it's hot now.

261
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,651
I'm looking across the street at
the summit, and I seen four people melt.

262
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,417
By the way,
they were police officers.

263
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:23,393
Sign them up on extended warranty,
Clover, all right?

264
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,057
Your station, 102 JAMZ.

265
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,529
Well, you'll be doing
a lot more of that soon.

266
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,699
- What do you mean?
- My cousin just called, son.

267
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:39,175
You are going to be
an assistant manager.

268
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:43,806
Heard the news today.
They got a position open in Dallas.

269
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,510
- No shit.
- No shit!

270
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,815
- For real?
- For real.

271
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,321
Now, you go on over there
and make me some more money.

272
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,723
Yeah, let me tell you about shit

273
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,659
They got shit in the wall

274
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,459
Shit that travels
and will stick to you

275
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,227
And it grows in your mind

276
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,565
It grows in your mind
and in your soul

277
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,903
They got shit like that
Shit that won't let you forget

278
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:14,742
Shit that'll clog up your mind
and make everything nasty

279
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,747
Shit that won't let you

280
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,148
You can't wipe it away
You can't rub it away

281
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,416
You can't scrub it away

282
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,988
Mama! Hey, Mama.

283
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,027
You know I got good news.

284
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,656
You ain't gonna believe what happened.
Put your prettiest dress on-

285
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,142
For seven years
I've been assistant manager.

286
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,442
Seven years.

287
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,983
I've been in charge of eight,
sometimes ten people at a time.

288
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,887
Lord, I've had my problems.

289
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,124
But in seven years
my register's never come up short.

290
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,135
That made me proud.

291
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,193
And in one day...

292
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:17,674
my child took my seven years
for ten dollars!

293
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,113
Oh, I've tried to love him.

294
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,153
It's been hard, but I tried.

295
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,883
I'd have thrown him to the street
long ago if you weren't in my house.

296
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,832
You're like night and day.

297
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,961
Now...

298
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,773
what was your good news?

299
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,843
It's okay.

300
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,607
We'll talk about it later.

301
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,949
You okay, Mom?

302
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,020
I'll be fine.

303
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,491
Now, I gotta get you off the stage.
You hungry?

304
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,927
I ain't seen that many dents
on my automobile.

305
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,659
I don't know why you're trying
to play me out, girl.

306
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,031
You know you want me.

307
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,866
I'll let you do anything
you want to do to me, freaky.

308
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,838
Just don't touch my hair.

309
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,106
Oh, come on, girl.

310
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,271
You're gonna play me
like I'm baldheaded, huh?

311
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,372
Yo, Teddy-

312
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,120
Let's go home.

313
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,251
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Come on.

314
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,388
Get on off the stage!

315
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,794
I'm sick of your trifling ass!

316
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,533
Goddamn, man.

317
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,210
How could you steal
from your own mama?

318
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,714
Can't you do right?

319
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,684
Like who?
Like you?

320
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,379
I'd rather be locked up for life...

321
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,015
before I was like your punk ass.

322
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,390
Fucking mama's boy.

323
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,894
What?

324
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,625
If you wasn't drunk
I'd kick your ass.

325
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,428
Did I get Jay upset?

326
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,995
So what you going to do now, boy?
Build another airplane?

327
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,472
Goddamn it, Jay!

328
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,846
- Now I gotta fucking get another one.
- No, nigger. No.

329
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,851
No, you're done.

330
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,855
Nigger, you ain't my daddy!

331
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,721
Shit, I ain't got no daddy.

332
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,696
Bang!

333
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,706
Stop it! Stop it!

334
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:55,918
I don't have those dreams
no more, Jay.

335
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,520
And it's all...

336
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,527
'cause of this.

337
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,544
It's just like garlic.

338
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,211
It helps keep the ghosts away.

339
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,719
Dallas-

340
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:07,026
some of the finest asses
I've seen in Texas.

341
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,556
- It's a hell of a job, boy.
- I can't take it.

342
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,929
What?
Boy, what you talking about?

343
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,439
I just can't take it.

344
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,241
You're gonna pass up
a salaried job?

345
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,275
Twenty thousand dollars a year.

346
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,913
Boy, you better have a good reason.

347
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,981
Look, Elmo. Don't sweat me, all right?
I just can't take it.

348
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,791
It's that brother of yours,
ain't it?

349
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,393
Every time he gets out...

350
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,059
you start fucking up!

351
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,133
My mama needs my help,
and that's what I'm gonna give her.

352
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,477
Is my TV ready yet?
Hi, Jason.

353
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,486
- How you doing, Mrs. Murphy?
- Please get them kids away from my TVs.

354
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,818
Hell, they probably know how
to fix a TV better than you.

355
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,085
Is my TV ready?

356
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,889
Come on, Ruth.

357
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,632
- You go on over there.
- Mister, you like my plane?

358
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,126
It's a bad mother, ain't it?

359
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,898
Grandma gave it to me. Said my black ass
needed to get used to flying.

360
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,341
Last time we flew to Corpus
to see my aunt...

361
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,436
I threw up all over
my grandma's best hat.

362
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,244
That's why she bought me a plane.
Does that ever happen when you fly?

363
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:38,011
Don't know.
I've never flown in a plane before.

364
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,818
Sometimes you don't need a plane
to fly.

365
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,330
Sell TVs?

366
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,614
Jason-
I'm Jason Alexander.

367
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,520
That's very nice to know, Jason.
Now can I have my keys?

368
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:24,864
My brother does need his truck
and I do need to get to work.

369
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,299
Where you work?

370
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,971
Why? You looking for a job?

371
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,371
No, I just thought, maybe, you know,
one night we could get together-

372
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,709
Well...

373
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,115
if it's meant to be,
you'll find me.

374
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,964
All right, you old raggedy-looking
motherfucker, let's try it again.

375
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,765
Which hand is it in, Pigpen?

376
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,500
Nice try, Tommy.
Try again, boy.

377
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,110
Tommy boy.

378
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,241
Freed his mind,
his ass didn't follow.

379
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,908
Sixteen years old.

380
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,749
Used to be the smartest nigger
in the hood.

381
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,880
Dog couldn't have been too smart.

382
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,325
So you was in the joint
with Joshua?

383
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,590
You're a nosy motherfucker,
ain't you?

384
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,191
Inquiring minds want to know.

385
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,758
Brother's from the ward.

386
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,430
- How many stones we got left, man?
- Two.

387
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,637
Man, ain't you tired
of that nickel-and-diming it?

388
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,437
Why? You got something better?

389
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,876
You know me, Josh.

390
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,210
I got a partner
who could set you straight.

391
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,817
I got my gig.

392
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,682
Okay. A gig.

393
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,881
Remember,
gigs can always get better.

394
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,391
I'm cool.

395
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,889
Hey, all right.

396
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,725
Catch you later.

397
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,564
Watch that nigger, man.

398
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,571
Watch your back.
It's the parole board.

399
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,402
Behind you. Give it here.

400
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,638
- What's up?
- Definitely not that shirt.

401
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,841
Shut up, man.
Get that shit out of my face.

402
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,178
Yo, toss me-

403
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,515
Toss me a 40.

404
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,786
So, you pound the pavement today?
You find some work?

405
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,593
Hey, come on, Jay.
You know how this economy is.

406
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,899
I figured I might as well
sit on my ass, eyeing the cootchie...

407
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,441
and just wait out this recession.

408
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,711
Wait it out.

409
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,212
Come on.

410
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,178
- Hey, what's up, girl?
- What's up?

411
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,155
Want an drink? Welcome to my-
Don't touch my hair!

412
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,555
Now, you better not be out here
doing what these fools is doing.

413
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,652
Hey, come on, Jay.
It's just a joke.

414
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:08,028
Well, you need to get serious
and get you a job.

415
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,567
I'm looking, man.

416
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,035
You looking?

417
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,130
Yeah. I put in four applications
just today.

418
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,371
But ain't nobody dying to hire
a brother fresh out of the joint, man.

419
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,639
You know?

420
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,647
Yeah, I know.

421
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,243
I circled a couple in here
to help you out.

422
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,415
Yeah, all right, man.
I'll check 'em out tomorrow.

423
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,516
Flies around my head.
Excuse me, baby.

424
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,652
Looking and feeling
like an Ethiopian.

425
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,923
Let's go get something to eat, man.

426
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,532
Some pig feet.
We ain't Muslims. Come on, man.

427
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,306
102 JAMZ, the Mad Hatter, and there's
been a lot of bank-jacking going down.

428
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:54,902
I got to say that Jesse James
1800 attitude is not gonna make it.

429
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,140
What you do in the dark
is gonna come to light.

430
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,944
Enough said, and I'm out.

431
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,008
More phat jams right now
on 102 JAMZ.

432
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,829
- Hey, Lyric.
- How you doing?

433
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:20,030
So, Lyric, when you gonna be stopping
with the Mother Teresa thing...

434
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,129
and start giving it up
to the brothers?

435
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:28,574
Alonzo. I didn't mean nothing
by it, man. It was wrong, man.

436
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,171
No. No, Jelly.

437
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,979
You're absolutely correct.

438
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,519
See, Lyric be wearing her panties
so tight...

439
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,556
she ain't got enough room
for that little kitty cat to breathe.

440
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:46,990
Maybe if she spread her legs more often,
she could chill the fuck out.

441
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,097
Shut the fuck up.
Get out. Parade's over.

442
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,265
What's wrong, little sis?

443
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,467
Wait.
They tripping, huh?

444
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,533
They bothering you?

445
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,637
Come on. Talk to big brother.
Let me know what's going on.

446
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,842
Oh, wait. You mad?

447
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,408
- I know you ain't mad.
- Alonzo.

448
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,722
- I ain't gonna lose no sleep.
- Whatever.

449
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:17,923
Come here.

450
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,966
- You is leaving?
- Yeah.

451
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:27,027
Okay.
Well, don't be late.

452
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,403
Come on, baby. You know
even when I'm late, I'm always on time.

453
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,601
- All right.
- Wipe that lipstick up.

454
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,976
Now, you know I get off soon.

455
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,811
Oh, I'll be back.

456
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,010
That man!

457
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,454
102 JAMZ, one for you slow and easy.

458
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,722
That man, girl.
Gives me chills.

459
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,387
Just like a nightmare.

460
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,830
"To give vent now and then
to his feelings...

461
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,630
is a great comfort,
condolence, and...

462
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,502
ease to man's heart."
Francesco Guicciardini.

463
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,339
Girl, I am so sick of you
and your quotes.

464
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,039
Don't knock my self-improvement.

465
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,208
- Oh, is that what that is?
- That's what it is.

466
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,184
What are you illing about, Lyric?

467
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:19,245
My orthopedic shoes ain't working,
and I'm sick and tired...

468
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,814
of serving these hungry negroes
and my period just started.

469
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:25,157
Girl, damn!

470
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,562
"lt is terribly amusing how many
different climates of feeling...

471
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,534
one can go through in a day."
Anne Morrow Lindbergh.

472
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,038
Go on, girl.
Get on out of here.

473
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,769
I'll cover for you, okay?

474
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,744
- Marti, you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

475
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,007
Don't come over here
with all that. Just go.

476
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,114
- Thank you, Marti.
- You're welcome.

477
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,451
I don't know about it,
but Joshua knows about it.

478
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:02,856
Welcome to This Is lt.

479
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,867
May I help you?

480
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:10,707
Chicken, black-eyed peas,
corn on the cob, sucker and a pickle.

481
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,608
And you?

482
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,375
Hey, Lyric, girl.
You feeling all right?

483
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,246
No, I'm all right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

484
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,089
Marti, thanks, hear?

485
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,630
Oh, night-night, Lyric.

486
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,961
- Call me?
- I will.

487
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,968
Now, what can I get for you, sir?

488
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,499
Let me get
one of them titties to go...

489
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,273
a side of ass,
and a cup of them lips.

490
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,474
Well, I'm sorry, sir, 'cause they don't
have none of that on the menu.

491
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,984
They look like they need to be
on a tray.

492
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:59,455
Excuse me, is there anybody else
in here that can serve this fool?

493
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,286
I'm on my break.

494
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,496
Mind if I join you?

495
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,856
- Maybe.
- Then again...

496
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,199
maybe not.

497
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,363
So, where you headed?

498
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,872
Home.

499
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:22,469
You said if it was meant to be
I'd find you.

500
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,741
Well, I found you.

501
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,513
Guess you're waiting for the bus.

502
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,821
Guess I am.

503
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,590
What?

504
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:41,187
Don't you know that bus ain't gonna
be on time tonight, girl?

505
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,325
'Cause this is meant to be.
This is magic, see?

506
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,770
So, come on.
Let me give you a ride.

507
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,137
Well, I guess
it wasn't meant to be.

508
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:15,092
Romeo. You'd have had it by now
if you'd had these.

509
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,360
- Thanks, man. You need anything?
- Just some money.

510
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:23,232
- Hey, I'll give you $20 for these.
- Hell, no. Not my roses.

511
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,174
- Twenty bucks? Sell 'em, baby!
- But you just gave me these!

512
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,540
- Sold.
- You Indian giver!

513
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,917
I do not need this tonight.

514
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,888
- Beautiful night, ain't it?
- Magical.

515
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,019
Damn, you're cold!
You always this difficult?

516
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,325
Can't you find
somebody else to harass?

517
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:24,333
Harass?
I thought I was being charming.

518
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,461
- Wrong.
- Come on. Let me give you a ride.

519
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,768
Look, I don't know you, okay?

520
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,775
For all I know, you're a gangsta,
and I don't ride with no gangstas.

521
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,778
Yo, I ain't no gangsta.

522
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,677
I got a job.

523
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,546
Know what I'm saying?

524
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,086
No drugs, no guns-

525
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,145
I sell TVs all day long.

526
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,248
I sold you one,
as a matter of fact.

527
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,987
I wear this corny uniform...

528
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,790
eat fried chicken...

529
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:56,458
almost every day
'cause my mama works at Frenchy's.

530
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,936
I have nightmares that I'm gonna
grow wings and cluck...

531
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,199
Iike a chicken!

532
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,537
I ask you,
is that the life of a gangsta?

533
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,348
You smiled.

534
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,149
So?

535
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,676
Look...

536
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,110
I ain't even gonna ask you
on a date.

537
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,173
I just want you to hook me up,
you know?

538
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,148
Tell me where you're gonna be
so I can be there too.

539
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,985
If you're going to the market...

540
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,925
I want to be in the same aisle.

541
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,428
If you're going to church...

542
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,555
I want to be in the back pew.

543
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:07,097
I just want to see you again.
That's all. I promise...

544
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,571
I won't even talk to you.

545
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,166
I just want to see you again.

546
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,213
Anywhere?

547
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,222
Name the place.

548
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,088
The old trestle bridge.

549
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,592
Yes!

550
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:37,433
Wait a minute! That bridge is barely
standing. It ain't been used in years.

551
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,797
- Well, that's where I'll be.
- Well, when?

552
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,806
When the sun next leaves footprints
across the sky.

553
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,136
Excuse me?

554
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,650
Tomorrow night at 7:00.

555
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,820
Oh, wait!

556
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,710
So, you coming, or what?

557
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,623
Why don't you come down?

558
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,955
All you got to do is
climb up here.

559
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,464
It ain't the climbing
I'm worried about.

560
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,057
It's the falling
that's got me bothered.

561
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,069
You said anywhere.

562
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,032
Yeah.

563
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,041
I said anywhere.

564
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,538
Yo, this is some crazy shit.

565
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,943
So, where do you think it's going?

566
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,612
What?

567
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,212
The bus.

568
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,884
I don't know.

569
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,893
I don't know either.

570
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,160
Isn't that great?

571
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,358
What?

572
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,866
Not knowing!

573
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:11,336
I mean, you see a bus pass
and all you know is that it's going.

574
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,535
But where?

575
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,706
Where could be anyplace you want.

576
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,045
It's kind of like dreaming.

577
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,047
You contemplating suicide?

578
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,056
You gonna jump off here?

579
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:32,323
Forget it.
I knew you wouldn't understand.

580
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,161
So, I guess you come here a lot.

581
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,342
Best place in town
to watch the sunset.

582
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,612
Look at that.

583
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,747
I ain't never really watched
the sun set before.

584
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,229
So, tell me something.

585
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,535
When can we get together again?
'Cause I was thinking maybe we could-

586
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,377
Surprise me.

587
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,490
Pastor preached a good service today.

588
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,499
What's your brother in there doing?

589
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,502
I don't know.
He wouldn't let me in there either.

590
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,003
Lordy mercy.

591
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,167
I can't remember when you last helped me
with the laundry. What's going on?

592
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,872
If you wanted a man to take you
someplace special...

593
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,679
where would that place be?

594
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,686
You met somebody.

595
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,484
I didn't say all that.

596
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,219
What's she like?

597
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,262
Damn! Female intuition.

598
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,564
Well?

599
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,001
Can't get a take on her,
you know?

600
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:24,837
One minute she's dissing me,
giving me a hard time.

601
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,877
Next minute she's showing me things
I ain't never seen before.

602
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,213
You like her, don't you?

603
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,220
Maddog took me on a picnic once.

604
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,081
Couldn't afford a blanket, so we used
a sheet, kind of like this one.

605
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,526
I believe that's the day
I fell in love with him.

606
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,293
Something special about picnics.

607
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,427
What we got here, man?

608
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,160
- Hotel Alexander?
- Ain't nothing.

609
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,259
- Smells good.
- Thanks, man.

610
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,167
Save some of that for me.
I'm gonna go change, all right?

611
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:29,671
All right.

612
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,738
Mama, what are you doing?

613
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,016
Mom, I made this for you!

614
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,754
- Stop it! I just bought that shit!
- With drug money.

615
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,689
How do you know I didn't get it
the honest way? How do you know that?

616
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:58,063
Every time you come out,
I pray it's gonna be different.

617
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:01,228
But it's always the same.

618
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:05,138
Not the roast, Mama.
I spent $25 on that roast.

619
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,507
What are you doing?
I spent a hundred dollars on that shit!

620
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,603
A hundred dollars
to make you happy, Mama.

621
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,841
Drug money.

622
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:18,186
I'll die-
You hear me?

623
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,780
I'll die before I feed my family
with that money.

624
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,792
And if you ever bring it in my house
again, the doors will be locked.

625
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,789
Now I see
how a man could beat you.

626
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,801
I knew Maddog's ghost was
somewheres to be found...

627
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,929
but I had no idea
it was in my own house.

628
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,011
Fuck!

629
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,187
Get out of the fucking car!
Gimme this-

630
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,526
Help, please!

631
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,027
Nice, Joshua.

632
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,295
Real nice.
What you looking for?

633
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:40,700
- What you willing to give?
- Two-fifty.

634
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,795
Are you crazy?

635
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,999
You got a dent in the back,
you broke the window-

636
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,067
This is an everyday thing
for me here. Done deal.

637
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:50,544
So, what's up with this flak?

638
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,774
You been thinking about
what we talked about?

639
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,683
Yeah, nigger,
and I done told you I got a gig.

640
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:00,086
What? That penny-ante shit?
That ain't a gig.

641
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,488
What you're out there
doing on the street is hustling.

642
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,260
Look where you're standing.

643
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,263
This is a gig.

644
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,341
- I ain't impressed.
- Man, we got other things going.

645
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:25,770
Do one or two more jobs
like this, man, and you're hooked.

646
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,976
I could do ten of these
motherfuckers a day, man.

647
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,679
Don't even worry about it, though.
I'm gonna hook you up.

648
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,916
- You gonna hook it up?
- Oh, yeah.

649
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,685
All right, nigger.

650
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,715
This ride's on me.

651
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,617
Jason, what are you doing?

652
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,951
You said "surprise me."

653
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,082
Well, I didn't mean for you
to go steal no bus.

654
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,218
Oh, this bus belongs to us
for the day.

655
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,159
My man hooked this up.

656
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,789
Come on.
I'm gonna take you to a special place.

657
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,229
I don't know about this.

658
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,164
Jason, you sure about this?

659
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,374
That's the problem.

660
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,611
I can't see nothing.

661
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,157
You're okay.

662
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,303
Jason, if you don't hurry up
and take this thing off me...

663
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,306
I'm gonna-

664
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,228
Oh, man.

665
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,900
Damn, it's quiet out here.
I should've brought my radio.

666
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:07,664
No, it's not quiet.
It's full of music.

667
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,671
Just listen.

668
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,710
Come on.

669
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,625
I'm in Paris.

670
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,006
I'm standing
in the grandest hotel...

671
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,668
wearing a flawless gown...

672
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:22,176
and it's fuchsia...

673
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:26,014
with emeralds and rhinestones...

674
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,017
with a long, long train.

675
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,453
Be careful.
Don't step on it.

676
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,649
And all the men are checking me out
'cause I'm fine.

677
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:42,096
And all the women
are green with envy.

678
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,360
And then way across the room...

679
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,998
I see-

680
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,299
You see me?

681
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,446
I'm wearing a-

682
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:01,312
I'm wearing a tuxedo...

683
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,649
and I'm a prince.

684
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,655
Fuck it, I'm Prince Charming.

685
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,450
And I'm checking you out.

686
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,031
Why do you always do that?

687
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,633
Girl, you know what they say..

688
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:12,613
the bigger the titty,
the bigger the tip.

689
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,641
Girl, my titties are so sore.

690
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:21,281
Your brother be sucking on these things
like he's breast-feeding.

691
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,951
Sounds romantic.

692
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,256
We got it like that.

693
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,490
So, Miss Girl...

694
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:31,795
what's going on
with your love life?

695
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,497
Come on now, give it up.
Give up the 411.

696
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,468
We went to the bayou.

697
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,267
- The bayou?
- Mm-hmm.

698
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,313
Whatever.

699
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,281
Well, what you all did
at the bayou?

700
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,183
We walked...

701
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:53,188
and we talked...

702
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,550
and he washed my feet.

703
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,619
What, girl?

704
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:04,291
I'd just die for a nigger
to wash these feet.

705
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,461
Yes, girl, I know.

706
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,768
And then he laid me down...

707
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:15,538
and he rubbed my head
so gently.

708
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:20,215
Lyric...

709
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:24,552
you didn't make love?

710
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:34,161
"Come live with me
and be my love...

711
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:38,166
and we will soon
the pleasures prove...

712
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:42,500
of golden sands
and crystal brooks...

713
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:47,270
silken lines
and silver hooks."

714
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,969
Go on, girl.

715
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:56,674
John Donne, 1572-1631.

716
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,787
- Marti, you know what?
- What?

717
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:10,124
There could be someone out there
who could give you the same thing.

718
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:19,635
Miss Girl, please.

719
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,906
A man that's better
than Alonzo?

720
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,913
I don't think so.

721
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,649
I

722
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,696
Know I've been changed

723
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,697
You see that

724
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,569
Good Lordy

725
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:56,836
What up?

726
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,472
So I hear you're a fool
who ain't afraid to bleed.

727
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:04,008
Josh ain't to be flexed with.
That motherfucker got heart.

728
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,520
Remember I told you about the time
we was in the joint...

729
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:10,548
and that motherfucker beat down four
fools who was trying to jack my shit.

730
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,924
Straight up.
I'm down with the thug life.

731
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:18,195
From what I hear, you down
with the petty drug life.

732
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,266
With me, you could be making
three G's in one night.

733
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,967
- What you know about that?
- Nothing.

734
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,509
I'm listening.

735
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,804
Bank-jacking.

736
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:37,113
- Easy as taking candy from a baby.
- Yes, sir.

737
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:41,282
- Straight up, dog.
- What you need me for?

738
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,291
Need you?

739
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,220
Nigger, I don't need you.

740
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:50,163
I'm just doing this
as a favor for my boy...

741
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,963
and it's only 'cause he say
he owe you.

742
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,971
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
think about it.

743
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,497
Do me a favor.
While you think about it...

744
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:06,380
why don't all of y'all get your
broke asses the fuck outta my face.

745
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,882
Come on.

746
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,249
Can't you see I'm trying
to catch the Holy Ghost?

747
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,083
Amazing grace

748
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:17,592
How sweet the sound

749
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,687
That saved a wretch

750
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:25,495
It was God's amazing grace
that saved a wretch like me

751
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:59,256
No matter what
my situation may be

752
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:10,035
It's everything

753
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,853
Just like Alonzo said- we ain't making
no money. You can't even win this.

754
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:25,951
I told you I don't wanna hear
that motherfucker's name again.

755
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,462
Man, you tripping.
Let's go.

756
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:35,192
- Still losing.
- Fuck it. I won.

757
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,040
What the hell wrong with you? You didn't
win that. Gimme my prize back.

758
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,979
- Fuck!
- What the fuck you doing?

759
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,539
You gonna get us all arrested.

760
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,551
You're some simple
motherfuckers.

761
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,658
Everything

762
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,860
Well, don't be scared.
You scared? I'll take care of you.

763
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:37,922
I can take care of myself
just fine, thank you.

764
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,400
Yeah, but I'll
take care of you better.

765
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,403
- Oh, you think so?
- I know it.

766
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:45,440
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry.

767
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,368
Yo, what up, Jay?

768
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,675
I've been looking all over
for you, man.

769
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:59,643
- What's your name, baby?
- Lyric. This is my brother, Josh.

770
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:00,814
That's a beautiful name.

771
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:14,169
Oh, this ride is cool.

772
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,175
Lyric, I told you.
Hey, man, what are you doing?

773
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,687
Jason, what's wrong
with your brother?

774
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,864
Stop it. Stop it.

775
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:08,285
- Get me outta here.
- Lyric, it's all right.

776
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,450
- Leave me alone.
- Josh, I told you, leave her alone.

777
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,495
Hey, wait up.
Where you going?

778
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:16,690
- Get your hands off me.
- What the fuck is your problem?

779
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,825
- What? What's wrong?
- Get your fucking hands off her.

780
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,370
Damn, Jay, what,
is the pussy that good, nigger?

781
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:23,962
- What?
- She take it up the ass?

782
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,675
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man? Huh?

783
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:31,508
Come on, man.
I was fucking joking, man.

784
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,913
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You a motherfucking joke.

785
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:37,008
- Come on, man.
- Hey, hey.

786
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:39,077
All right, I'm sorry.

787
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,782
- You're a fucking clown, man.
- Jason, he apologized.

788
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,825
- No, he didn't mean it.
- Yes, he did.

789
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:47,157
How you know my brother's
telling the truth? You don't know that.

790
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,460
Hey, Jay, not in front
of my crew, man.

791
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,864
Crew?
You can't even get paid.

792
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,995
- I can get paid, man.
- You could get paid?

793
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:59,370
Show me, motherfucker,
you can get paid.

794
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,012
Give me my fucking gun, man.

795
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,650
You're tripping!

796
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,656
Yo, man, you know he out there.
That's your brother.

797
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,536
Yeah, boy.

798
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,235
Nigger don't let me get
on them damn dominoes.

799
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,504
I taught you.

800
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,069
You ain't as stupid
as I thought.

801
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,706
- Straight up.
- Yeah.

802
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,183
I wanna get paid.

803
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,584
I heard they're hiring
at Frenchy's.

804
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:50,851
Now run down and get me
some chicken.

805
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,484
Motherfucker.

806
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,553
Is the proposition
still open or what?

807
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,734
Nigger, get your goddamn hands
off my table.

808
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:12,837
Yeah. Like that, fool?

809
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:15,440
Like a fool with a little
fire under his ass.

810
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,576
Got a little something going.

811
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,390
All right, you down.
You down, dog.

812
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,123
Now get your dirty ass
out of the way of my television...

813
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:32,361
so I can finish watching that
motherfucker get his ass whupped.

814
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:33,867
Wait a minute.

815
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,234
Look at this shit.

816
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,866
- He's playing.
- Look at this shit. Watch out, man.

817
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,876
Let me tell you about love

818
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,205
Love is a hurtin' thing

819
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,577
Sometimes you gotta fight for it

820
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:50,311
Love will tell you
I dare you to cross that line

821
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,252
And you've got to say
I'll do that

822
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,017
Look love in the eye

823
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,651
And when you think love'll hurt ya
abuse and desert ya

824
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,719
It'll pick you up, lift you up

825
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:05,460
Turn you around
put a smile on your face

826
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:09,163
And leave a rainbow of joy
in your heart

827
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,941
Yes.

828
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,357
Yes.

829
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,172
Stay with me.

830
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,042
Here?

831
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:05,813
I'm so tired.

832
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:08,907
I just wanna...

833
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,316
sleep without
nightmares tonight.

834
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,629
Here's the door here.

835
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:27,430
- Ron, you cover the guard here.
- Right.

836
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:30,994
Josh, I want you to cover
the guard right here.

837
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,166
Both of y'all hold
everything else breathing.

838
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:37,644
Any fuckups between y'all two,
and we all dead.

839
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,877
Darryl, I want you to hit the tellers
and hit 'em quick.

840
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:44,077
I'll be making my way
back to that vault.

841
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,583
We get in...

842
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,452
we get our grift...

843
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,684
we get out.

844
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:53,728
Nobody get greedy,
nobody get caught.

845
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:58,289
I don't know, A-1.

846
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:01,028
I might feel like doing
a little bit of shopping.

847
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:03,896
Come here.

848
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:12,142
How about shopping for this gat?
You wanna pay that price?

849
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,687
Come on, nigger, get that shit
the fuck outta my face.

850
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,000
Now let's get down to business.

851
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,367
I'm ready to get paid.

852
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,565
Look, I'm the chief...

853
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,631
and you an Indian.

854
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,940
And that mean no one getting paid
till I say so.

855
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,946
102 JAMZ, my man, Brad...

856
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,778
better known as Scarface,
kicking that phat one right there-

857
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,818
You cool?

858
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:53,616
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- You better be...

859
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:57,920
'cause we in there at 9:30,
not 9:29...

860
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:01,895
not 9:31, 9:30.

861
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:05,194
You wait long, nigger,
you wait wrong.

862
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,981
What you looking
at my sister for?

863
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,520
Your sister?

864
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,357
Well, she sure is fine.

865
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:35,192
You know, I might have to tell
my brother to step aside.

866
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:37,060
Oh, is that right?

867
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:40,067
Didn't I tell you
to put that down?

868
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:42,902
Hardhead.

869
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,688
Why do you like
planes so much?

870
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,990
There was this cat
named Old Man Johnson.

871
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:13,125
Maddog used to take us
to his field.

872
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:17,638
He used to water the wild flowers
with his fire plane.

873
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,402
I used to think it was magic.

874
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:25,412
Used to call him "Rainmaker."

875
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,583
He died though.

876
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:39,393
Jason, there's something I need
to tell you about your brother.

877
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:41,224
My brother?

878
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,793
He's gonna rob a bank
tomorrow with them.

879
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,733
"With them"?
Who's "them"?

880
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,905
My brother and his crew.

881
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,258
Don't cross Alonzo.

882
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:16,624
Baby, I'm just gonna
talk to Josh.

883
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,794
You know, I stopped dating
guys in the ward...

884
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:26,170
'cause I was tired of wondering...

885
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,732
if I was gonna find them
in a body bag.

886
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:34,006
Promise me all you're
gonna do is talk.

887
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,447
I promise.

888
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,831
It's time for us to get
on that bus anyway.

889
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:59,169
What?

890
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:08,973
I'm just- It's time to stop watching
them buses and get on one.

891
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:12,114
Where will we go?

892
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:14,980
Where do you want to go?

893
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:19,288
I want to go everywhere!
When can we leave?

894
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,661
When you wanna leave?

895
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,530
Jason, why wait?
Why not tomorrow?

896
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,938
Meet me at the pier...

897
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:38,003
when the sun next leaves footprints
across the sky.

898
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:02,262
- How's the workout?
- Kicking.

899
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,031
I'll catch you.

900
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,104
What? You in a rush?

901
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,269
- You in a hurry?
- Yeah, man.

902
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,437
Where you going?

903
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:15,142
I got some business
to take care of, man.

904
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:17,810
What kind of business you got?

905
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,878
- It's just some ghetto shit, nigger.
- You trying to play me?

906
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:24,118
Come on, Jay.
What you talking about?

907
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,184
You think you're man enough
to rob a bank?

908
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:32,566
It was that bitch, wasn't it?

909
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:37,065
You ain't nothing.
Nothing!

910
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:38,366
You ain't no man.

911
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,473
You think I'm that stupid?

912
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:52,077
You know what? I ain't
in no hurry to go back to that cage.

913
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,986
I know no one else around here
believes in me...

914
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:58,492
but I always thought,
when it came down to it...

915
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,425
you would.

916
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:11,228
Can't rob no bank
without no piece, Jay.

917
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,977
What you waiting on?
Sing.

918
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:28,386
- Oh, say, can you see
- Come on, keep singing.

919
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,981
- By the dawn's early light
- Come on, come on.

920
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:34,085
Now hurry up with that money.

921
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,294
I don't hear y'all.

922
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,528
Get the combination.
Open this door.

923
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:45,039
Put your hands on your stomach
and stay down.

924
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,636
Get in the safe!

925
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:52,839
I said- Hey, come on.

926
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,438
Look at the time.

927
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:57,212
- I told you he was a hardhead.
- Watch your back.

928
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,356
Let's go.
We ain't got time for this.

929
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:06,552
Let's go. Come on.

930
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:12,063
Shit, man. Let's go.
We ain't got time.

931
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,294
Break it up in there.
Break it up now.

932
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:18,397
What the hell you doing?

933
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,464
Man thinks
he's taking his thing out?

934
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,375
- What about the money?
- Fuck the money! Let's go.

935
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,415
What do you mean, fuck the money?
What are you talking about, man?

936
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:36,548
Come on.

937
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:38,057
Shit.

938
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:44,387
The motherfucker's
still in there.

939
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:46,490
Give me your watch.

940
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,328
Give me your fucking watch!

941
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,896
Give me your watch, motherfucker!

942
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:56,205
You disrespecting me?
You dissing me, motherfucker?

943
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:10,515
Anybody asks you, you tell them
Jesse James robbed this motherfucker.

944
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:18,962
Get in the car.
Get in the fucking car.

945
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:22,535
Let's go.

946
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:53,761
Yo, Josh, dog,
we're gonna take you home, fix you up.

947
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:55,564
Wake up.

948
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,901
Wake the fuck up!

949
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,133
You ain't dead, is you?

950
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,142
No, you ain't dead.

951
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:18,257
Damn, you're fucked up.

952
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,759
Shit.

953
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,020
A-1, dog.

954
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,125
- Maybe this might wake you up.
- Shit.

955
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,432
Come on, man,
don't do that shit.

956
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:33,770
Put that shit down, man.
Put that shit down on the floor, man.

957
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:36,605
It ain't my fault.
It ain't my fucking fault, man.

958
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:39,704
- What are you talking about?
- Blame your bitch-ass sister.

959
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:44,375
Nigger, what the fuck does my sister
gotta do with this, fool?

960
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:46,613
Everything.
Everything, man.

961
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:49,384
She told my brother
what was going down.

962
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:52,153
She told my brother
about the bank robbery, man.

963
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,659
That's why I was late.

964
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:57,960
See, he was sweating me, man.

965
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,795
That's why I was late.

966
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:07,836
No, no, nigger.
You fucked up my money.

967
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:10,877
Your brother's
fucking my sister?

968
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:15,011
- I'm gonna fuck both of you all fools.
- Yeah, that's right.

969
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:18,575
Slow, nigger, piece...

970
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:19,813
No, man.

971
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:21,184
by piece.

972
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:32,761
Throw this motherfucker out
with the rest of the shit.

973
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:33,926
You bet, man.

974
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,569
Give me that motherfucking watch.

975
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,869
Fucking late nigger
gonna tell time?

976
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:49,715
Me and Lyric, we're just thinking
about getting on a bus and going.

977
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,718
We're just gonna go.

978
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,458
Your brother's gonna miss you.

979
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:04,890
He's gonna be all right.

980
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:07,901
Mama, why can't you
just be happy for me?

981
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:10,732
I am.

982
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:25,110
Oh, Lord, Jesus Christ.
Oh, Lord.

983
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,745
Alonzo did this to you, man?

984
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:31,155
Motherfuckers, man!

985
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,159
Come on, I'll get you
to the hospital, man.

986
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:36,685
You know I'll get you to the hospital.
I'll take care of you. Come on.

987
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:41,326
Come on, baby. You know
I'll get you there. Come on.

988
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:46,169
Come on, stand up,
stand up, stand up.

989
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,709
I'm sorry.

990
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:09,259
Man, I'm ready to take that buster out,
and he can't foul, man.

991
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:13,391
- Why'd you let him go like that?
- No shit.

992
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,562
I told y'all, I'm gonna
make that fool suffer.

993
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,901
If his brother got
in my business-

994
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:24,069
- Bullshit, right?
- Keep the chains ready, fool.

995
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:28,309
I'll let y'all know when it's time
to buy his mama that black dress.

996
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:34,449
I'm ready for round two.
Hook me up.

997
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,888
- Hold this.
- Yeah.

998
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:43,989
Which one do you think is bigger...
this gat or my dick?

999
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:46,499
Definitely, it's the gat, fool.

1000
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,147
This is for my brother.

1001
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:28,332
Fucker.
Fuck you.

1002
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:26,897
"Come live with me
and be my love...

1003
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,630
and we will some
new pleasures prove...

1004
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:32,571
of golden sands
and crystal brooks...

1005
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,904
with silken lines...

1006
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:40,439
and silver hooks."

1007
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:51,090
We're not going, are we?

1008
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,928
You got in the middle,
didn't you?

1009
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:00,126
It's my family. They-

1010
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:03,432
My brother. They need me.

1011
01:34:03,504 --> 01:34:06,302
No, I need you!

1012
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:12,838
- Lyric, you know-
- Shut up. Shut up.

1013
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:15,347
- See, you don't-
- Shut up!

1014
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:26,851
You know...

1015
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:32,895
I guess that's why I spend
all of my life fantasizing-

1016
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:36,334
'cause I just couldn't stand
this ghetto shit.

1017
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:42,675
God.

1018
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:48,545
Jason, I am trying to love you.

1019
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:52,177
But I don't want my heart broken.

1020
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:55,154
And that's exactly
what you're gonna do...

1021
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:58,589
if you keep trying to save a brother
that don't want to be saved.

1022
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:05,527
What kind of hold
does he have on you, huh?

1023
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:09,867
Why do you keep having
these nightmares?

1024
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:16,135
You might as well just go ahead.
My life is fucked up.

1025
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,771
It's been fucked up ever since-

1026
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:22,179
Since what?

1027
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,153
Since-

1028
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,959
When we was little...

1029
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:41,901
one night,
me and Josh was in bed...

1030
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:45,228
we heard this real loud noise.

1031
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,840
So me and Josh got up
to see what was going on.

1032
01:35:58,385 --> 01:35:59,784
Daddy...

1033
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:02,084
had come to the door.

1034
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:04,090
He was all drunk...

1035
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:10,458
and he was beating on Mama.

1036
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,000
- Get out of here, boy!
- I tried- I wanted to stop it.

1037
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,331
And Josh went-

1038
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:19,969
Josh went...

1039
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,974
and got Mama's gun.

1040
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:26,236
Mama screamed, and she told him,
"Don't kill anybody."

1041
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:41,327
So I tried to take it from him.

1042
01:36:41,395 --> 01:36:44,660
- No, baby! No, baby! No!
- Give me the gun.

1043
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:46,859
When I tried to take it
from him...

1044
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:49,129
Daddy came rushing towards me.

1045
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:52,263
And before I could do anything,
I just turned around.

1046
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:08,046
I didn't mean to shoot him.

1047
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:33,744
I just want my daddy back.

1048
01:37:34,815 --> 01:37:36,749
Jason, God.

1049
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,154
Oh, Jason, it's not your fault.

1050
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:46,859
It's not your fault.
Listen to me.

1051
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:51,363
You were just trying to be a hero.

1052
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:55,226
Just like you're doing
right now.

1053
01:37:57,371 --> 01:38:00,772
But sometimes heroes
have to walk away.

1054
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:05,611
Walk away, Jason.

1055
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:10,444
Or we can't be together.

1056
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:58,286
That's the day he came home.

1057
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:02,392
There should've been a band
and a job waiting for him.

1058
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,910
I guess it's easy to walk around
with blinders on...

1059
01:39:14,982 --> 01:39:17,974
and not notice the sacrifices
people are making for you.

1060
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:28,288
You don't owe Joshua
and me nothing.

1061
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:31,126
You hear me?
There are no debts...

1062
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:33,132
in this house.

1063
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:41,704
Nobody killed Maddog.
He died in that war.

1064
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:46,771
They just didn't bury him.

1065
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:58,983
I want you to go to her, baby.

1066
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:09,966
Be happy.

1067
01:41:09,863 --> 01:41:12,195
Alonzo, man, why don't you
just tell us who jumped your ass...

1068
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:14,598
so we can take care
of those busters?

1069
01:41:14,668 --> 01:41:16,192
'Cause I told you, I tripped.

1070
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:19,398
You tripped off what, man?
Transco Tower?

1071
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:21,964
- Shut up, Darryl.
- I don't play that trip shit, man.

1072
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:26,239
I told you, girl.

1073
01:41:26,313 --> 01:41:29,077
I knew you was
gonna get cussed out.

1074
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:31,674
Alonzo don't play that.

1075
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:35,813
You had no business telling Jason
about that bank robbery.

1076
01:41:38,892 --> 01:41:41,827
Just forget it, girl, okay?

1077
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:44,921
You got every right
to see that nigger...

1078
01:41:44,998 --> 01:41:47,262
if you want to.

1079
01:41:47,334 --> 01:41:51,794
I just wish you'd get up, girl.
Stop moping around here and call him.

1080
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:53,806
I can't.

1081
01:41:56,577 --> 01:41:59,410
It's like Jason
never even happened.

1082
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:05,847
But you know it did.

1083
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:11,949
Oh, Miss Girl, I know...

1084
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:13,458
that...

1085
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:18,528
Alonzo's not perfect.

1086
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:22,399
But I'm gonna hold onto him...

1087
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:24,630
'cause it's all I got.

1088
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,567
The wards ain't full of Jasons.

1089
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:33,546
What you found-

1090
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,614
What you found was quiet...

1091
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:43,656
in a world full of thunder.

1092
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:51,931
I ain't got no choice
but to listen to it.

1093
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,192
You do.

1094
01:42:56,803 --> 01:42:58,964
Yo, Marti, bring your
fine ass down here, girl.

1095
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:17,422
Love calls.

1096
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:28,826
Jason. Come on, man.
Joshua's gone crazy.

1097
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:30,733
- Come on, man.
- Let's just go.

1098
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:34,103
Who knows what he's all gonna do?
Come on, he's got a gun.

1099
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,172
You got any jimmies?

1100
01:43:41,248 --> 01:43:44,809
No. No, but that's all right.
That's all right.

1101
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:48,013
- All right for who?
- All right for us.

1102
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:52,451
Now why do you have to go
and do that? Damn.

1103
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:56,189
Don't start the fire
unless you could hose me down.

1104
01:43:56,263 --> 01:43:57,958
Baby, come on.

1105
01:43:58,031 --> 01:44:01,797
Get off me.

1106
01:44:01,868 --> 01:44:05,861
What? You gonna butter the biscuit
when it pops out of the oven?

1107
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:08,772
Biscuit?
Ain't no biscuits, girl.

1108
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:10,776
I didn't think so, okay?

1109
01:44:11,845 --> 01:44:15,042
I hope he don't get to Alonzo
before we do, man. He might kill him.

1110
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:24,390
We'll be back
in a few minutes.

1111
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:27,552
Alonzo, watch that other jaw.

1112
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:04,829
- Come on, man.
- Come on, man, just drive on through.

1113
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:06,827
Damn.

1114
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,458
Fuck.

1115
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:11,863
Fuck.

1116
01:45:25,919 --> 01:45:28,114
I got this college girl-

1117
01:45:28,188 --> 01:45:29,849
I know her name.

1118
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:17,127
Come on, baby.
Come on.

1119
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:43,061
I'm gonna find you.

1120
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:05,349
Where's Alonzo?

1121
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:06,909
He ain't in here.

1122
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:16,687
Why you taking Jay away from me?
Don't you know he's all I got?

1123
01:47:18,198 --> 01:47:19,563
Josh, don't.

1124
01:47:19,633 --> 01:47:23,069
That's why you can't have him.
You hear me?

1125
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:27,132
You can't fucking have him!

1126
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:38,149
Me and Jason- we're over.

1127
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:41,751
You're lying.

1128
01:47:41,822 --> 01:47:44,256
Why you gotta lie to me?

1129
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,290
You think he better than me?

1130
01:47:51,731 --> 01:47:53,494
I knew you'd come!

1131
01:47:54,534 --> 01:47:57,059
You're always still
pick up the pieces.

1132
01:47:57,137 --> 01:48:00,334
You seen them two niggers
I got downstairs?

1133
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:02,341
Yeah, I seen them, man.

1134
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:05,173
I took care of that.

1135
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:10,312
All we gotta do now
is wait for Alonzo.

1136
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:12,817
You ain't gotta go
nowhere, man.

1137
01:48:13,887 --> 01:48:16,617
You're right, Josh.

1138
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:19,420
I ain't gotta go nowhere.
Just let her go.

1139
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:23,691
I can't let her go, Jay.
We gonna use her as bait.

1140
01:48:24,998 --> 01:48:28,627
But she ain't got nothing
to do with this, Josh.

1141
01:48:28,702 --> 01:48:30,829
We can take Alonzo together-
me and you.

1142
01:48:32,138 --> 01:48:36,097
Why you still talking about her?

1143
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:38,701
What is this?

1144
01:48:38,778 --> 01:48:42,111
You fucking putting her above me?
You're putting her above me, man.

1145
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,444
No, man.

1146
01:48:45,285 --> 01:48:48,152
Shit. What about me, man?
What about me?

1147
01:48:49,222 --> 01:48:51,156
What about you?

1148
01:48:51,224 --> 01:48:54,557
It's always been about you. I spent
my whole fucking life for you.

1149
01:48:58,265 --> 01:49:01,325
I can't do that no more, man.

1150
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:05,997
Oh, I'm tired of you telling me
I'm fucking up, man.

1151
01:49:08,008 --> 01:49:12,138
Shit. 'Cause
I took care of this.

1152
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:14,146
So fuck you, man.

1153
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,273
You fucked up!
This shit is fucked up.

1154
01:49:16,349 --> 01:49:20,012
I'm tired of your shit.
I don't need this no more.

1155
01:49:20,086 --> 01:49:23,021
I don't need you. I don't need you.
Fuck you.

1156
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:25,057
I don't give a fuck about you.
Fuck this.

1157
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:28,424
Don't make me do this again.
Come on, let her go.

1158
01:49:28,495 --> 01:49:31,658
Don't make me
do this again, man.

1159
01:49:34,868 --> 01:49:36,859
She taking you away
from me, man?

1160
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:50,511
Well, I ain't got nothing.

1161
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:53,678
I love you, man.

1162
01:49:57,424 --> 01:49:58,516
Love me, man?

1163
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:05,562
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1164
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:11,696
Shoot me.

1165
01:50:24,985 --> 01:50:27,783
I'm ready to go.

1166
01:50:27,854 --> 01:50:29,788
Come on, get up.

1167
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:35,422
You gotta get up
'cause we gotta go. Come on.

1168
01:50:38,565 --> 01:50:40,499
I'm sorry, man.

1169
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:49,870
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1170
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:55,213
Jay, you're all I got.

1171
01:50:58,351 --> 01:51:01,252
I love you, Jason.

1172
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:06,015
You can't go, man.

1173
01:51:09,562 --> 01:51:11,496
You can't leave me.

1174
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:01,412
Shit.

1175
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,024
It was Joshua, man.

1176
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:58,093
He shot Lyric,
then he did himself.

1177
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:04,710
Oh, shit.

1178
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:18,486
We have a gunshot victim.
We'll be transporting to your location.
