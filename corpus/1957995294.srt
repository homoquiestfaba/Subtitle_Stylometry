1
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:12,490
Is the bloom off the Ivy Rose?

2
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,362
What's up, guys?

3
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:18,235
It's me, Dan Buford, here
with your Celebrity Gossip.

4
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:21,282
Pop sensation, Ivy Rose,
may seem to have it all.

5
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,066
Legions of adoring fans,

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,982
an up-and-coming social
media megastar boyfriend

7
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:29,072
in Becker Daniels, and
her most recent album,

8
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,422
"Party Nights...
[It's Party Time]"

9
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:34,338
has been at the top of
the charts for 16 weeks

10
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:36,645
with no sign of slowing down.

11
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:39,996
But the situation is
a little more thorny

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,954
than Ivy's public
image may suggest.

13
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,044
The Celebrity Gossip
Minute has obtained

14
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:47,047
exclusive information
from sources close

15
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:51,051
to the pop star that Ivy's
life is drama-city right now.

16
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:53,488
Word is she's battling her
manager-extraordinaire,

17
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:56,230
Naomi Klein, and
her record label

18
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:58,362
on the creative
direction of her career.

19
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:01,844
Things with her and
Becker are wilting fast.

20
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:03,933
Peter Pan complex much?

21
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:07,371
And, apparently, Ivy wants
to avoid the one thing

22
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:10,983
pop stars desperately
crave: the spotlight.

23
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,550
Drama.

24
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,509
But, look out, it's
not all bad news.

25
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:18,252
We also have it on authority
that Ivy will soon be performing

26
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:22,343
songs from her album at a very
small, very intimate venue,

27
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,345
very exclusive.

28
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,955
You heard it here first, folks.

29
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,652
And remember what we always say,

30
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:31,003
"They're just rumors,
so you can't sue us."

31
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:33,963
And that's all for this edition
of Celebrity Gossip Minute.

32
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,356
We'll see you next time.

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,932
Wow, Becker, this place
is really romantic.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,412
Only the best for you, babe.

35
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,106
Excuse me, you can't
just walk in here!

36
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,982
[camera shutter clicking]

37
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,308
Hey, guys, we're just trying to
have a quiet dinner in peace.

38
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:57,552
How about cutting us some slack?

39
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,513
Wow, that's new.

40
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,515
I thought you loved
the spotlight.

41
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,867
Yeah, well, I thought about
what you said the other night.

42
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,043
See? I listen.

43
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:14,351
And I also needed a private
moment to be able to do this.

44
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,228
Okay.

45
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,106
Woman: Oh my God, wow.

46
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,590
Ivy...

47
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,026
[chuckles nervously]

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,202
You make me want
to be a better man.

49
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:43,424
I want nothing more than to
buy a house, to get married,

50
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,036
fill it with kids and grow
old and gray together.

51
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,040
Will you do me the favor
of looking over there

52
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:54,391
and saying, "I've
just been skunked!"

53
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:58,612
Wait, wait, what?

54
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,180
What is this?

55
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,994
It's a prank. We're
gonna be on "Skunked".

56
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,835
This is awesome, right?

57
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:06,925
No! No, this is not awesome.

58
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,536
Why would you do this?

59
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,281
Come on.

60
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,891
You said you wanted
to feel normal.

61
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,546
I was like I will show
her what normal is.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,461
Normal sucks.

63
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,158
No.

64
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:25,335
I thought it was really
sweet and romantic.

65
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,077
We're two of the most
famous people in the world.

66
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,971
When I propose to you,
it's gonna be insane.

67
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,950
I don't want insane.

68
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,344
I wanted the real
version of that.

69
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,086
I can't do this anymore.

70
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:40,916
Look, you're mad.

71
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,874
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:47,009
No. I've been feeling like
this for a really long time.

73
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,925
But tonight, it
just solidified it.

74
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,492
We're on two different pages.

75
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,016
It's not fair to
either one of us

76
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,192
to pretend that we're not, okay?

77
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,326
I'm sorry. It's over.

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,631
It's over?

79
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,403
First off, we just wanted to
start by saying how excited

80
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,077
we are to be in the
Ivy Rose business.

81
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,819
International pop star,
Ivy Rose. So excited.

82
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,517
Thank you.

83
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,867
You know, what about
when I'm not working,

84
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,869
I could take the wig off.

85
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,611
And that way, I can move
around the world undetected

86
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,090
and kind of have some privacy.

87
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,092
No, the wig stays.

88
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,400
Ivy Rose isn't just about music.

89
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,359
It's a vibe.

90
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:36,928
And maintaining that
vibe is so, so important.

91
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:40,976
I mean, would people even know
who you are without the wig?

92
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,630
That's kind of the point.

93
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:45,197
So we all know that your
last album was a hit.

94
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:49,376
But we feel it's time
Ivy Rose grew up.

95
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,203
I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

96
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,945
I was thinking maybe I
could write my own music

97
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,817
for my next album.

98
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,993
Right. Well, we'd love if
that were possible, Ivy.

99
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,567
The thing is, Sean and I kind
of have this down to a science.

100
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,258
Trust the experts, Ivy.

101
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,260
But I actually became a musician

102
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,915
so that I could perform
my own music, you know.

103
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,284
Kind of like Taylor
Swift's "Folklore."

104
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,048
I want my own "Folklore!"

105
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,573
We actually feel like "Party
Night [It's Party Time]"

106
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,401
is your "Folklore."

107
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,881
Your next album would
actually be your "Evermore".

108
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,796
Oh, I just got the chills.

109
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,537
Right?

110
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,123
If your song ain't in
the club, it's a flub.

111
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,845
As I like to say.

112
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,108
But it's true. It's true.

113
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,350
[bell rings]

114
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:51,525
Oh!

115
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,092
Just the man I was looking for.

116
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,007
Hi, Cameron.

117
00:05:56,181 --> 00:06:01,317
Darren, I have scored two
extremely exclusive tickets

118
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,016
for a intimate
small launch party

119
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,979
with five-time Grammy
winner, Ivy Rose!

120
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,723
Cameron, that's
awesome, it really is.

121
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,029
I just have so much to
get done around the store.

122
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:20,162
Well, how about this?

123
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,294
You can give me a
list of things to do.

124
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,122
And then I'll go and do them

125
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:27,996
so that you two can
go and have some fun.

126
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,041
Oh, thank you. Perfect.

127
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:33,349
Darren, what do you say?

128
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,787
Yeah, all right. I'll go.

129
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:37,962
Yay.

130
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,877
This is great!

131
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,051
See you later.

132
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,925
- Bye.
- Bye!

133
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,971
Enjoy the show.

134
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:47,842
I'll get you back for this.

135
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:49,365
Ah!

136
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:57,895
Front row.

137
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,245
Front row! Oh, my, yes.

138
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,857
- Amazing.
- Cool.

139
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,989
Oh, this is so incredible.

140
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,427
Yeah.

141
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,995
So, what? What kind of
music does she sing?

142
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,520
Darren, really?

143
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:15,565
Naomi?

144
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,960
What if I played some of my
own music just for tonight?

145
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:21,876
Since the audience is so small.

146
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,358
I mean, I wish, Ivy...
I really, really wish.

147
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,187
It's just that this
promo is for your album,

148
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,667
and you know the fans.

149
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,364
They only really want
to hear the hits.

150
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,497
- You get it.
- Yeah.

151
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,892
Don't make my own choices.
Just do what I'm told.

152
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,546
You got it.

153
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,853
Does she have purple
hair or is that a thing?

154
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,289
Is that her thing?

155
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,030
Yes, Darren, she
has purple hair.

156
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,903
Okay. How come you don't
have a purple wig on?

157
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:53,168
Oh, I... I just thought
my hair looked nice.

158
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,083
Oh, no, it does.

159
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:56,998
It's show time.

00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,692
I feel crazy.

361
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:19,957
I just... last night,
you were so nice to me.

362
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,438
And I can't remember
the last time

363
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,919
someone was just
genuinely nice to me

364
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,616
without wanting
something in return.

365
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,967
So I just thought...

366
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,230
I'm gonna stop talking now.

367
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:34,450
Hold on, hold on. It's okay.

368
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:38,498
I liked talking to
you too last night.

369
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,195
Talking.

370
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:45,069
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,072
I'm Karina. Big fan.

372
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,162
And Karina was just getting
back to work, wasn't she?

373
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,382
Ugh. Not fair.

374
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:56,472
Anyway, I thought this would
be a perfect place for me

375
00:20:56,646 --> 00:21:00,520
to kind of decompress and
reconnect with my work.

376
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,913
So I rented a house

377
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:06,526
and I'm just gonna kind of
see where it all takes me.

378
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,964
Okay. Well, cool.

379
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,053
I guess I'll see
you around then.

380
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:18,015
What if I like worked here?

381
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,975
- Worked here?
- Yeah.

382
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,109
Remember quiet, normal job?

383
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,242
I mean, I don't know. It...

384
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,288
I think what he means to say is

385
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:32,029
that he doesn't know why
you didn't ask sooner.

386
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,945
Oh, is that what I meant?

387
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,079
Yeah, I get it, and you don't
even have to pay me anything.

388
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,950
I'll blend right in.

389
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:42,257
You didn't even recognize
me without the wig, right?

390
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:46,348
And, more importantly,
I didn't recognize you.

391
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:49,177
Did I mention I'm a big fan?

392
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,921
And, look, I'll
be here, you know.

393
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:55,357
Like I'll help you.

394
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,577
There's not a lot to do anyway.

395
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,883
My loyal employee.

396
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:03,931
I'm not getting out of this
without saying yes, am I?

397
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,281
[both] No.

398
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,327
Okay.

399
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,982
Well, Ivy Rose, welcome
to Wall of Sound Records.

400
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:14,333
You're hired-ish!

401
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:18,424
Oh, my gosh! Yes! Thank you!

402
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,642
Do I get a badge?

403
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,253
A badge.

404
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,038
I can make you a badge.

405
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:25,212
No, we don't wear badges.

406
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:46,800
What are you up to, Ivy Rose?

407
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,335
Morning, Ivy.

408
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,119
Welcome.

409
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:04,295
Well, if you don't want
any unwanted attention,

410
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,385
I can't go by Ivy, right?

411
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,953
So I am Jamie
reporting for duty.

412
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:11,868
Why Jamie?

413
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,435
It's my real name.

414
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,176
I haven't gone by it
since high school.

415
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,484
So what are my duties, boss?

416
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:20,529
Oh, please don't call me boss.

417
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:21,965
Makes me feel old.

418
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,880
You are old.

419
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:26,317
Choosing to ignore that.

420
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,058
Let's get to work!

421
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:30,104
- Okay.
- Great!

422
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:31,540
Show me what I do.

423
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,499
- Here's the records.
- Ooh, okay.

424
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:34,717
So what do we do?

425
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:36,502
We have a pretty purple one...

426
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,068
[chattering]

427
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:40,244
[clears throat]

428
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,468
Hi!

429
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,949
Welcome to the Wall
of Sound Records.

430
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,951
I am Jamie, and you are...

431
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,041
Oh, I'm Paige.

432
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,869
Wow, not used to be
asked that in a store.

433
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,045
Well, that's the kind
of customer service

434
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,526
we provide here at
Wall of Sound Records.

435
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,310
So formal.

436
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,312
So is there anything
I can help you with?

437
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,357
Yeah.

438
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,883
I'm looking for "Party Night
[It's Party Time]" by Ivy Rose.

439
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,885
Right, yeah.

440
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,235
That's... we could find that.

441
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,020
If I was Ivy Rose...

442
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:19,153
which I'm not...

443
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,548
What section would I be in?

444
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:24,550
- You put the price on the...
- You know what?

445
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:27,084
Can you give me a minute while
I ask my associate something?

446
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,468
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

447
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:34,037
Um, oddly, she is looking
for one of my albums.

448
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:35,996
Awkward.

449
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,868
We don't actually
carry your music here.

450
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,696
Okay.

451
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,917
I don't hate that, but
maybe you can just point me

452
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,771
to the pop section so
we can save the sale?

453
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:49,052
There is no pop section,
modern pop anyway.

454
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,273
See, Darren doesn't
believe in pop music.

455
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:54,144
Okay, it's not like
I don't believe it,

456
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:56,016
like it's a ghost or something.

457
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,846
I just happen to believe
that pop peaked around 1983.

458
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,282
Before you were born?

459
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:02,896
My dad brought me
up on the classics.

460
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,415
What can I say?

461
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,069
Okay.

462
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:11,292
I'm so sorry, Paige. We
don't carry that here.

463
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,816
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

464
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,905
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,168
Are you...

466
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:20,170
No, sorry.

467
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,061
I thought you were somebody
I went to high school with.

468
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:25,045
Yeah, I guess I have one
of those familiar faces.

469
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,612
Well, thank you anyway.

470
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:28,154
I'll just have to
go somewhere else.

471
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:29,876
- Okay.
- Thanks.

472
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,442
Bye. Sorry.

473
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:38,537
Well, the disguise works,
I'll give you that.

474
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:40,539
Yeah, I told you it would.

475
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,019
But, more importantly,
we lost a sale.

476
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:47,328
Ah, yes. Welcome to every
day of Wall of Sound Records.

477
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,809
Hey, I'm sitting right here.

478
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,552
So? Okay.

479
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,319
I understand that you
already gave me an extension.

480
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:06,173
I just... gotta go.

481
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,044
A customer just came in.

482
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,484
Hey, is everything okay?

483
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:14,766
Can I help you with anything?

484
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,271
Nope. Just business stuff.

485
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,881
Nothing to worry about.

486
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:20,840
Nothing to worry about?

487
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,017
Sir, this is my
place of employment.

488
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:27,455
Okay, not in the mood for jokes.

489
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:32,112
Sorry. Just... long day.

490
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,548
[phone rings]

491
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,512
Can I make an observation
about the store?

492
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,210
One day working
in a record store

493
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,038
and she's already an expert.

494
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,692
I don't have to be an expert

495
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,650
to see what's wrong in
your business model.

496
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,218
With music streaming, it's
a miracle anyone would want

497
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:54,003
to walk into a record store
and buy physical music at all.

498
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:58,051
So at least when they do,
you can have what they want.

499
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,879
So what's the deal?

500
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:03,491
For me, it was always
about operating a store

501
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,536
that was a collector's dream.

502
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,104
Audiophile's paradise.

503
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:10,063
How about a truce?

504
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:11,477
How about I take you to dinner?

505
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,457
- I don't know. I...
- Come on.

506
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,546
It's the least I can do
after I made you kiss me

507
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,984
in front of my ex-boyfriend.

508
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:19,768
I rented a house in your town

509
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,989
and I came to your store
and made you give me a job.

510
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:24,991
Wow.

511
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,273
When you list it all out like
that, it's kind of a lot.

512
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,212
Yeah, it is.

513
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:32,389
All right, you got
me. Dinner it is.

514
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,522
Great! Okay.

515
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,742
So where do people
eat around here?

516
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,880
Nice place, huh?

517
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,839
Yes, this is very... uh.

518
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:50,407
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

519
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,323
Very French.

520
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:56,283
Best Deer Falls has to offer.

521
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:58,372
So you come here often?

522
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,287
Oh, yeah, all the time.

523
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:03,377
My favorite dish is the, um...

524
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:07,468
Con-fit de co... canard.

525
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:09,296
Your favorite, huh?

526
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,472
Get it all the time.

527
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:13,996
You've clearly never
been here before.

528
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,250
Figured it'd be nothing but
the finest things in life

529
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,304
for our VIP guest.

530
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:19,219
Well, I'm Jamie, remember?

531
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,221
No VIP status here.

532
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:23,310
Okay.

533
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,052
Okay, and is Jamie saying
she doesn't want to eat here?

534
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:29,795
Jamie doesn't want to eat here.

535
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,535
Jamie wants real food.

536
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,147
Thank God. I think I
could accommodate that.

537
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:40,806
This house is incredible.

538
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,333
I love it here.
It's so peaceful.

539
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:49,858
Your, uh, cheeseburger, Miss.

540
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,687
Now this is more like it.

541
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,779
Mm!

542
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,303
- Good?
- This burger is next level.

543
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:03,829
Sorry they didn't have any
of your Con-fit co-nard.

544
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,569
Right.

545
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,504
I'm still so insulted
that you took me there.

546
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,071
Well, I guess it's fair that
you have something on me

547
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:11,271
since I already
have so much on you.

548
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,639
Should I go over
that list again?

549
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,404
No, I think we're good.

550
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,710
Yeah.

551
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,498
So what about the "why"?

552
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,459
Why?

553
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,895
I mean, don't get me wrong.

554
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,419
I love music with
all of my heart.

555
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:34,816
But I just... I didn't know
it was gonna be what it is.

556
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,035
And what is it?

557
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,427
My life doesn't belong to me.

558
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:40,517
My image, my relationship...

559
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:42,519
just everything is about

560
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:46,436
preserving ticket
and record sales.

561
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,396
So it's just pressure, pressure,
pressure building all the time.

562
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:55,141
So here I am, Deer Fall's
number one unpaid intern.

563
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:57,230
It probably didn't
hurt that I was, like,

564
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,927
you know, super handsome.

565
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:02,539
Moderately handsome...
from a distance.

566
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:05,020
Okay. You couldn't
even give me that?

567
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:07,849
Well, thank you for gracing
us with your presence,

568
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,633
runaway pop star.

569
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:14,508
So what about you?

570
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:16,597
I'm divorced.

571
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,425
Oh. I'm sorry.

572
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,643
No, no, don't be.

573
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,081
No, we were just kids, you know.

574
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,667
We figured that's what
you do after college.

575
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,519
But as we grew up together,

576
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,609
we realized that we were both
heading in different directions.

577
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,916
Well, that's a pretty
mature outlook you have.

578
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,180
I can say that now with
years of hindsight.

579
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,245
So, yeah, I took out way
too big of a loan, you know.

580
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,463
And I didn't know
the first thing about

581
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,228
running a record store.

582
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:42,144
But when my marriage dissolved,
I still had the store.

583
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:46,409
And what a great store
it is, very old school.

584
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,107
Yeah, that's what
I was going for.

585
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,128
When I was a kid, our
basement looked like that.

586
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:52,502
You know, the shag carpeting,
wood paneling, all that.

587
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:54,635
Super dated, but also awesome.

588
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,506
My dad and I used to
hang out down there

589
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,943
and listen to old records.

590
00:30:58,117 --> 00:30:59,858
Oh.

591
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:02,991
So that explains the "my
music peaked in 1983" stance.

592
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:05,907
Yeah. I figured, you know,
when you get in one of those

593
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:09,041
audiophile blogs and
you turn it all around,

594
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:11,913
if somebody like Miles Enderman
gives your store a good review,

595
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,610
you got it made.

596
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,284
I wrote him once a week
the first two years

597
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:18,050
the store was open,
never replied.

598
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:23,142
So finally I just
threw in the towel.

599
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,318
Guess maybe I should do
that with the store, too.

600
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,974
What if we can help
save the store?

601
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,628
Consider it an
exchange for letting me

602
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:31,977
hide out from my problems.

603
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:32,978
Don't say that.

604
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:34,936
It's okay.

605
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,504
I know what I'm doing and I
want to help you save the store.

606
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:41,638
We just need to
make a few changes.

607
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,336
What kind of changes?

608
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,170
Sale?

609
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,130
Yeah.

610
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:57,480
Are we having a sale?

611
00:31:57,654 --> 00:31:59,221
Well, yes.

612
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,195
Actually, can you hand
me that box down there?

613
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,791
You can help me put it
up here? Go through it?

614
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:07,055
- Ivy?
- Yes?

615
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,069
The whole idea is to make
more money, not less.

616
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,973
Since you have no
customers to begin with,

617
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,227
it's just called marketing.

618
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:17,892
Also, there are baked goods.

619
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,547
We can pass these
out to our customers.

620
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:21,983
I made them myself.

621
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:23,332
- Oh...
- Go on.

622
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,552
Try one.

623
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:28,076
Fine. A little bite here.

624
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:32,602
What recipe did you use?

625
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:35,518
I didn't. I just
did it from scratch.

626
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,801
Well, it's a good thing that
we don't have any customers,

627
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,349
because these can't
give these to anyone.

628
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:42,047
I'm closing the door.

629
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,092
No! Then people won't
know it's a sale!

630
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:48,357
There is no sale... or
non-sale sale, whatever it is!

631
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,145
I think he's just on a diet.

632
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:58,280
Ladies and gentlemen!
Come one, come all!

633
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:01,066
You won't be laughing when
you see this collection!

634
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,678
Absolutely not! This
is not a carnival!

635
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,294
Yes, yes, yes! Go, go, go, go!

636
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:14,949
Please don't do that.

637
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:16,523
Okay, guys, guys,
please be careful.

638
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,908
No, no, no, no.

639
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,388
- Please don't...
- What?

640
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:21,390
That is our last
copy of that one.

641
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:22,609
Remember, folks!

642
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,263
Inside one very special record

643
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:28,006
is a golden ticket for
a very special prize!

644
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,271
Nope! Shut it down!

645
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:35,013
Shut it down.

646
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:42,542
[sighs]

647
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:46,328
I can't believe he shut down
every single one of my ideas.

648
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:48,243
Hey, Ivy?

649
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,506
- Yeah?
- Can I ask you something?

650
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,335
Sure.

651
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:55,642
What made you change your style?

652
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:59,080
I used to watch your videos
you put out on the internet,

653
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:03,302
and it was just you in
your bedroom with a guitar.

654
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,828
It felt like you
were just like me.

655
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,961
And then you got famous and
then everything changed.

656
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,659
I mean, I know
your life changed,

657
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:16,967
but the songs just didn't
sound like you anymore.

658
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,578
I know what you mean.

659
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,536
It's because they really
aren't me anymore.

660
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,932
They want Ivy Rose, the look
and Ivy Rose, the voice.

661
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:28,022
But not Ivy Rose, the mind.

662
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:31,025
I mean, have you
tried songwriting?

663
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,941
Yeah. I was just so
stressed out all the time,

664
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:37,162
everything I would write
felt forced and lame.

665
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:39,207
And then I was gonna write ere.

666
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:41,514
But I was in such a
rush getting out of town

667
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:44,038
that I forgot my guitar, so...

668
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:45,996
I have one. Two, in fact!

669
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,824
I keep one in the
back of the store.

670
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:50,020
- You want to borrow it?
- No, no, Karina. It's okay.

671
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,306
You don't have to do that.

672
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,003
I don't wanna
borrow your guitar.

673
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,962
No! Are you kidding?

674
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,416
The fact that I'll
be able to say

675
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:59,880
that Ivy Rose
played my guitar...

676
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:03,013
I mean, if you really mean it,

677
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,538
I'd actually really like that.

678
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:09,107
I do. Forget it.

679
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:13,154
You came here to disconnect.

680
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:17,463
And it's an opportunity
to... I don't know.

681
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:19,987
Reconnect with yourself?

682
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:24,513
I mean, that's what this whole
thing is about anyway, right?

683
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:25,993
Yeah.

684
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,038
Reconnect with myself

685
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:31,955
because myself is awesome.

686
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,957
I know you were just
trying to help earlier.

687
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,091
I guess I have a hard
time with change.

688
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:40,399
That's the understatement
of the century.

689
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,460
[phone rings]

690
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,168
[leaf blower]

691
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,012
[knocking]

692
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,887
Hi! What's up? Wanna hang out?

693
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,280
Ivy?

694
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,412
You're here... at my house.

695
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:40,241
Plus, I got you
coffee and a muffin.

696
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,940
Aren't you supposed to be
reconnecting with yourself?

697
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,334
Yeah, I tried that.

698
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:49,946
It's a work in
progress, baby steps.

699
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,557
Come on. Let's go.

700
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,342
Fine. I'll take that.

701
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,564
So I didn't pack many
clothes before coming here.

702
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:00,305
Know of any good thrift stores?

703
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:08,313
Oh, my gosh! Look
at this store!

704
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,923
So cute!

705
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,795
I never figured you
for a vintage girl.

706
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,710
Oh, my gosh.

707
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,060
In high school, that's
pretty much all I would wear.

708
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,541
None of that fast
fake vintage stuff,

709
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:20,977
you get the real deal.

710
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,937
Kind of like your store.

711
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,330
I see your point.

712
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,332
Yeah.

713
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:30,291
Nowadays, I really never get
to decide what I'm gonna wear.

714
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:35,514
But today is a new
dawn and a new me.

715
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:38,821
Look at this hat!

716
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,606
Isn't that cute?

717
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,912
It's a statement.

718
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,175
A statement, yes.

719
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,221
I like this statement.

720
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,063
Yeah.

721
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,592
[chuckles] Yes.

722
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:18,470
Ta-da!

723
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:19,819
Yes.

724
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,821
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

725
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:23,562
But how do you feel?

726
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,826
I feel amazing.

727
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,958
- Then I'm glad you got them.
- Thank you.

728
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,352
Yeah, I feel like I struck gold.

729
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,876
You want me to
take that for you?

730
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,009
Yeah.

731
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,446
Thanks for spending
Sunday with me.

732
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,666
I can think of worse
ways to spend a Sunday.

733
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:44,757
Shall we?

734
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:54,767
You've got to be kidding me!

735
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,952
Hey, it's okay.

736
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:09,434
I told them that I was working
on getting the money...

737
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:10,913
Or a buyer.

738
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,394
Guess I didn't realize
it was that bad.

739
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,309
Well, if something
doesn't happen soon,

740
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,833
then I'm gonna lose the store
before I can even sell it.

741
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:19,879
I'm really sorry.

742
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,493
Yeah, well, not everything works
out the way it's supposed to.

743
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:30,280
Hey, is that your dad?

744
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:32,500
Yeah.

745
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,154
He was my hero.

746
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:36,243
We lost him my senior
year of high school.

747
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:40,508
Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I didn't know.

748
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:41,857
No, don't worry.

749
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,555
How would you know?

750
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:47,559
Having his picture there,
it kind of grounds me.

751
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:51,345
This place, the vibe,
the whole aesthetic,

752
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,175
it actually feels like it's
keeping his memory alive.

753
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:58,352
That makes sense.

754
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:01,616
I actually lost my
mom a few years ago.

755
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,052
It was really hard.

756
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:04,924
I'm sorry, too.

757
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,621
She was my best friend,

758
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:11,887
and she was so supportive
of my career in music.

759
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,847
Sometimes I feel like
I'm letting her down.

760
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,544
Letting her down?

761
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:20,156
Like what if I'm not
really that good?

762
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,944
Ivy, if you're not that good,
then we're all in trouble.

763
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:28,904
And yeah everyone has
imposter syndrome sometimes.

764
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,558
You know the number
of times I thought

765
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,604
I wasn't fit to
run a record store?

766
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:36,172
Although that one
might actually be true.

767
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:37,435
Okay, stop.

768
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:41,090
Okay, this store, it's great.

769
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:42,570
It's just your marketing...

770
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:45,007
Yeah, well, we might
not have to worry

771
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:46,487
about that for much longer.

772
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:52,885
Hey, I said I was gonna help
you with the store, didn't I?

773
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:55,540
Ivy, we tried your ideas.

774
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,324
I'm talking about
something bigger.

775
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,848
Why do I have a feeling
I'm gonna regret this?

776
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,895
Are you with me?

777
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:04,244
I'm with you.

778
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:05,854
- Let's do this!
- All right!

779
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,421
- Let's do it.
- Yeah!

780
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:14,080
Okay, ready for your surprise?

781
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:16,561
I feel like an idiot.

782
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:19,564
Okay.

783
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:21,566
One, two, three...

784
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,216
In addition to the lights,

785
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:25,744
I added a new music section,

786
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,442
some apparel and a
stage for local artists.

787
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:31,445
- Oh, and...
- Darren's Basement?

788
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,013
Yeah.

789
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:37,407
I mean, you said you didn't have
a real connection with the name.

790
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:41,455
And so there's just so
much of you in the store.

791
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:46,199
So I figured the name
should reflect that.

792
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:49,158
If you hate it, we can
just change it back.

793
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:52,422
I don't hate it.

794
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,554
No?

795
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,384
No.

796
00:41:57,558 --> 00:42:00,256
No, it's actually really cool.

797
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,171
Goodbye Wall of Sound,

798
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:04,870
Hello Darren's Basement.

799
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:10,919
Great! Because I already
had all of this made.

800
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:12,442
Merch.

801
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,229
Ivy, thank you for
doing all this.

802
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:18,318
Thanks for letting me help.

803
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:24,019
Hello?

804
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:26,500
Are you guys gonna keep
staring at each other?

805
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:28,850
Or are you gonna help
me unpack these boxes?

806
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:31,287
- Right. Sorry.
- No, that's fine.

807
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:32,724
Well, let's go, sport.

808
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,049
Hope you brought a
change of clothes.

809
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,683
It's soft relaunch time!

810
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:47,173
[laughing]

811
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:53,179
Come one, come all!
Darren's Basement!

812
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:55,660
We have a brand new remodel!

813
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,357
You have good style,
I have good style.

814
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,011
That has good style.
You should go in!

815
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:00,554
Got a lot of classic
records in there.

816
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,014
Let me tell you,
got amazing finds.

817
00:43:02,188 --> 00:43:04,108
- Guys, come in, come on!
- You're gonna love it.

818
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:06,148
Woo!

819
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:10,588
[chattering]

820
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:13,503
- Welcome to Darren's Basement!
- Welcome!

821
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:16,332
Darren's Basement, yep.

822
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:17,682
Buy everything!

823
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:27,605
Okay, two customers won't save
the store, but it's a start.

824
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,128
Relax.

825
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:30,999
Rome wasn't built in a day.

826
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,611
Was Rome for sale while
they were building it?

827
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:36,570
Ha-ha.

828
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:39,486
Anyway, I trust you
can hold down the fort.

829
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,227
Karina here is
gonna go grab lunch.

830
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:42,924
And I'm gonna be in the back

831
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:44,380
doing some paperwork
if you need me.

832
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:46,101
Okay. Yes, sir, boss, sir.

833
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:47,450
Don't call me that, please.

834
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,989
All right. Show time.

835
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:17,916
Hi, there.

836
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,092
Welcome to Darren's
Basement Records.

837
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,920
I'm Jamie.

838
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:24,357
Can I help you find anything?

839
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,840
Is all this wood
original? And the carpet?

840
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:30,711
Yes.

841
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:34,933
Our owner, Darren Howard,
actually restored it himself.

842
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:37,457
Impressive.

843
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:40,460
It's decidedly retro
without trying too hard.

844
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:45,770
Yes. That is exactly
how I would describe it.

845
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:56,998
Oh, wow, an Allman
Brothers 1973 bootleg?

846
00:44:57,172 --> 00:45:01,089
Original pressing of The
Beatles "Revolver" album.

847
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:05,441
And a 1950 Charlie Parker
"Live at Birdland".

848
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:08,618
Impressive selection.

849
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,882
Yes, well, our
owner Darren Howard,

850
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:12,971
he is quite the audiophile.

851
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:14,494
Yeah, I can see.

852
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:20,108
Yes. And over here, we
have our new releases.

853
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:25,287
And over here is a list of our
live in-store performances.

854
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:29,901
And over here, we have our
brand spanking new merch.

855
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:31,554
Seems like you've
got everything.

856
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,426
Yeah, pretty much.

857
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,471
Everything except customers.

858
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,212
That's a shame.

859
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:40,520
Oh, no. You should have
seen us this morning.

860
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:42,783
Naturally.

861
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:50,878
So is there anything I can
help package up for you?

862
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:53,881
No. Okay, thanks. I
think I'll get on my way.

863
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:57,189
Thank you. You've
been very helpful.

864
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:01,541
You know, it's funny.
You look quite familiar.

865
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,370
I can't quite pit it, but...

866
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:06,154
Okay, good day.

867
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:14,641
What a jerk!

868
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:29,308
What are you always
writing in there anyway?

869
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:30,962
Oh, it's nothing.

870
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:33,051
Miss Karina here is
quite the writer.

871
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:34,530
Come on. Let's see.

872
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:35,967
What are you writing?

873
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:38,230
Okay, it's just lyrics

874
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:40,928
that I'm writing for
some of my songs.

875
00:46:41,102 --> 00:46:44,018
Lyrics? So you've been
holding out on me.

876
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:45,192
Can I read?

877
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:47,021
No way!

878
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:48,936
That's so embarrassing!

879
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,696
Okay. You want to talk
about embarrassing?

880
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,896
My last album was called

881
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:56,639
"Party Night [It's Party Time]."

882
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,295
Yeah, like, why say party twice?

883
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:02,036
Yeah.

884
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,082
Okay, okay.

885
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:05,256
Yes. Thank you.

886
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:07,085
Let's see.

887
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,831
Oh, God...

888
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:15,093
Wow!

889
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:17,008
- Karina...
- Don't be scared.

890
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:19,271
These are amazing!

891
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:24,842
Yeah, they're so personal,
and raw and authentic.

892
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:26,582
I told you so.

893
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:30,282
No way. Ivy Rose just
complimented my lyrics?

894
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:32,850
No. Jamie did.

895
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:34,808
Whoops. Right. Sorry.

896
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:41,336
All right.

897
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,164
I want you to check out mine.

898
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:48,648
But, honestly, I've been
struggling, so just be honest.

899
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,261
Okay.

900
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:59,050
Well?

901
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:01,879
Okay, so spill it,
what do you think?

902
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:03,793
Meh.

903
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,404
Meh? Ouch.

904
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:06,884
Ouch, indeed.

905
00:48:07,058 --> 00:48:09,321
Okay, I appreciate the honesty.

906
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:12,498
That's what I wanted,
but just elaborate.

907
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:14,326
Tell me what you think.

908
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,982
I mean, they just feel
like they're written

909
00:48:18,156 --> 00:48:21,507
by someone who's trying
to seem authentic.

910
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:24,031
I mean, these lyrics
are very similar

911
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:26,381
to the ones that you used
to put out on YouTube.

912
00:48:26,555 --> 00:48:28,383
But isn't that a good thing?

913
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:30,342
Isn't that what you liked?

914
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:32,866
Well, yeah, but you're not
that person anymore, are you?

915
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,869
I mean, what about all the
life you've lived in between?

916
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:38,045
I mean, all the
life experiences.

917
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,961
Even the ones that you don't
like should inform your art.

918
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:43,224
Hey, I get what she's saying.

919
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:46,967
I mean, you were Jamie long
before you were Ivy Rose, right?

920
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:50,275
So what does Jamie feel
about Ivy Rose's career?

921
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:53,713
Wow.

922
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:58,022
I feel like I should know the
answer to that, but I don't.

923
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:01,808
Then I guess you
need to figure it out

924
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,027
to break down those walls.

925
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,813
She's a smart one, isn't she?

926
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:08,510
You both are pretty smart.

927
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:10,077
Oh, really?

928
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:13,254
So you know what
this means, right?

929
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:14,995
You have to help me.

930
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:16,692
Help you? How?

931
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:18,825
Well, I'm not that
teenage girl writing songs

932
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,393
in my room anymore, but you are.

933
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:26,485
You mean, write with... you?

934
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:27,877
Yes.

935
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:30,968
Oh, my gosh, you're kidding!

936
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:32,926
I'm gonna get to
write with Ivy Rose.

937
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,233
Yeah. Sounds like
a Dream Team.

938
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:41,108
♪ I took the quick
road out of town ♪

939
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:48,202
♪ Don't know when I've
ever been this down ♪

940
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:53,599
♪ If I could just
find my sound ♪

941
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:55,993
No, that is not good at all.

942
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,472
Wait. What?

943
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,997
Well, why are you
giving up so easily?

944
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:01,868
I just feel so stuck.

945
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,609
Well, let's get you unstuck.

946
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:07,134
Now come on, what do
you wanna write about?

947
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:08,962
I don't know.

948
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:11,096
Everything felt so much
easier when I was younger.

949
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:15,969
Life is so complicated now.

950
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:18,624
You know, adults say
that all the time.

951
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:20,887
But I don't think that's true.

952
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:23,150
I mean, you guys have
more stuff to do.

953
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:28,329
But you swap boys for
men and school for work

954
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:31,985
but the emotions are
still at the root of it.

955
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,250
Hmm, I guess that's true.

956
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:37,730
Yeah.

957
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:42,343
So should I be
writing about a man?

958
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:45,346
I mean, if you want to.

959
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,653
A man like Darren?

960
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:49,959
- Karina!
- What?

961
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:53,006
You like him, don't you?

962
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,592
I am not gonna talk
to you about this.

963
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:56,183
Why not?

964
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:59,926
I mean, he likes you,
you know. I can tell.

965
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,322
And he hasn't liked
someone for a long time.

966
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:10,197
Well, I enjoy our
professional friendship.

967
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:14,114
- Your professional friendship.
- Yes.

968
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:16,160
Please!

969
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:21,600
Oh, my gosh!

970
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:22,992
Guys! Guys!

971
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,211
What?

972
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:26,039
The store! It's famous!

973
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:28,607
Look at what my friend
just sent to me!

974
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:30,522
We're on Popular Audiophile!

975
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:32,306
Popular Audiophile?

976
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,569
Wait. Isn't that the blog
you were telling me about?

977
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:38,356
Yes, it's the premier blog
for vinyl record enthusiasts.

978
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,054
This is huge, but how?

979
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:43,317
Oh, my! That guy!

980
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,058
That's the guy! He was here!

981
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:48,409
Miles Enderman? He
was in my store?

982
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:51,064
Yes! That's the jerk I
was telling you about.

983
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:53,110
Why didn't you come get me?

984
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:56,025
I can't believe you got to meet
Miles Enderman and I didn't!

985
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,028
Wait, no. I didn't know
that was him, obviously.

986
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,553
Do you guys wanna read it or...

987
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:03,163
All right, yeah. Oh, okay.

988
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,556
Let's see.

989
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,601
"Boasting a wood panel aesthetic

Darren, I've never
seen you this excited.

1002
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:42,159
Ivy, you were right.

1003
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,378
Excuse me?

1004
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:46,206
Can you please say that again,

1005
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,990
louder so everyone can hear?

1006
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,037
I said, you were
right. You happy now?

1007
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:53,300
- Yes.
- And get this.

1008
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:57,913
Our numbers in social media have
basically tripled overnight!

1009

- Wow.
- Wow.

1010
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:02,440
Now if only our customers
would triple overnight.

1011
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:06,095
Oh, I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

[chattering]

1013
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:17,106
This is my favorite album.

You guys take checks?

1015
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:24,288
Yeah, we handle
checks, anything.

1016
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:26,638
Thank you.

1017
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,137
What?

1018
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:51,358
Deer Falls?

1019
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:57,625
Naomi?

1020
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,499
Yeah, I found her.

1021
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,423
You seem extra happy tonight.

1022
00:54:12,597 --> 00:54:14,251
I am.

1023
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:19,865
Or maybe that cheeseburger
was tasting extra good.

1024
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,259
No, really, I...

1025
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:27,568
really wanted to thank you
for everything you've done.

1026
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:29,918
You know, you don't have
to keep thanking me.

1027
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:34,183
I basically had to torture
you into letting me help you.

1028
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:38,013
Seriously, I got an
offer on the store today.

1029
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:40,059
That's really good, right?

1030
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:42,366
A week ago, I would
have said yes.

1031
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,369
But if business
keeps up like this,

1032
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:48,067
it's gonna feel even better
to tell that person no.

1033
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:50,896
I am so glad to
hear you say that.

1034
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,593
And I know Karina will be too.

1035
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:55,596
Good, because I'm a
little bit afraid of her.

1036
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,469
I am too,

1037
00:54:58,643 --> 00:55:01,602
but she seems to really care
about you and the store.

1038
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:04,953
Yep, and she really
seems to want us to date.

1039
00:55:05,127 --> 00:55:08,957
Yes, she does.

1040
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:12,004
Very subtle, yes.

1041
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:13,527
Nah, she's a good kid.

1042
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:14,746
Yeah.

1043
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,922
Her parents, they work a lot.

1044
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:19,446
She hangs around the
store, picks my brain.

1045
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,860
Eventually, she started helping
customers pick out music.

1046
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:24,843
So I figured she might
as well get paid for it.

1047
00:55:25,017 --> 00:55:26,540
That's really sweet of you.

1048
00:55:26,714 --> 00:55:31,937
So the proverbial
elephant in the room.

1049
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:33,373
What's next for Ivy Rose?

1050
00:55:35,593 --> 00:55:38,117
Next? Hmm.

1051
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:41,599
Being here is the first time

1052
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:44,428
I've really, truly
felt like myself.

1053
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:47,039
I've really, truly felt happy.

1054
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:48,693
Well, you could always stay.

1055
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:51,130
I mean, you know it
would keep me from having

1056
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:52,392
to hire a new employee,

1057
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:54,002
especially since
I don't pay you.

1058
00:55:54,176 --> 00:55:59,138
Is that the only reason?

1059
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:01,270
I guess I do have a house here.

1060
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:03,795
Yeah.

1061
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,144
Yeah, you could commute.

1062
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,189
I could commute, yeah.

1063
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,017
Ivy Rose, the commuter.

1064
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:10,628
Yeah, listening to podcasts.

1065
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:13,500

00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:23,336
Well, I guess I should
probably get going.

1068
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:26,992
Yeah. Okay.

1069
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:31,126
Hey, I had a really
good time tonight.

1070
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:35,261
I did, too.

1071
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:37,089
We should do it again sometime.

1072
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:40,179
Yeah, I'd like that, boss.

1073
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:43,008
I said don't call me that.

1074
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:47,360
Goodnight, Ivy Rose.

Fine. Today is a celebration.

1128
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:40,209
Because Darren's
Basement has passed

1129
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:42,464
over 10,000 followers
on social media,

1130
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,032
which I'm told by Ms.
Karina is a good thing.

1131
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:47,992
Yes! That is amazing!

Ooh, the fanciest.

1135
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,434
Thank you.

1136
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:56,672
But that is not
the biggest news.

1137
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:59,220
Spoke to my realtor today.

1138
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:01,614
And as of tomorrow,

1139
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:05,487
Darren's Basement is
officially off the market.

1140
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,316
Wait. You're not selling?

1141
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:10,318
I'm not selling.

1142
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:13,234

- Cheers.

1145
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,934
Woo-hoo!

1146
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:18,152
Okay, wait.

1147
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:19,588
I have also something special

1148
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,939
that I've been
waiting for these,

1149
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:25,072
but I can't think of anything
more special than this.

1150
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:27,422
Ta-da!

1151
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:29,033
More muffins.

1152
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:30,207
Uh-oh.

1153
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:31,644
You guys are really mean.

1154
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:34,516
Look. They're not
crumbly like last time.

1155
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:39,217
Yeah. I mean, these kind
of actually look edible.

1156
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,001
Yes, edible.

1157
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:43,482
Progress, all right?

1158
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:51,011
I feel like it's almost there.

1159
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:54,101
Almost, but I really
wanna stick the landing.

1160
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:59,454
Well, maybe we need to test
it somewhere, you know.

1161
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:01,152
It'll help us feel
what's missing.

1162
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,372
What? Like an open mic?

1163
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:11,031
Something a little
more intimate.

1164
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,384
Presenting...

1165
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:21,520
A work in progress
by Ivy Rose...

1166
01:02:21,694 --> 01:02:24,088
- And Karina.
- Oh.

1167
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,438
Yeah!

1168
01:02:26,612 --> 01:02:28,179
Okay. Don't laugh.

1169
01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:29,746
I would never.

1170
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:35,403
Know what? This
doesn't feel right.

1171
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:37,188
You have to play with me.

1172
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:39,016
- What? Me?
- Mm-hm.

1173
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,453
- No.
- Yeah, you helped me write it.

1174
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:44,238
So you have to play.
I need your harmonies.

1175
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:47,154
Well, I...

1176
01:02:47,328 --> 01:02:52,029
I have stage fright.

1177
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,119
What? You?

1178
01:02:55,293 --> 01:02:57,077
No way.

1179
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:58,251
Yes, way.

1180
01:02:58,383 --> 01:03:00,472
See? Yep.

1181
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:02,387
I talk a big game.

1182
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:08,480
But once I'm onstage,
I just freeze.

1183
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:12,919
You know what?

1184
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:14,921
I used to have
stage fright, too.

1185
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:20,013
So how'd you overcome it?

1186
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:23,060
Time, experience

1187
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:27,586
and it really helped me to
play with my best friend, Sage.

1188
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,067
I keep trying to tell
her it'll get better.

1189
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:33,070
Yeah, but what do you
know? You're a boy.

I'm Ivy Rose.

1191
01:03:38,597 --> 01:03:40,294
So, what do you say?

1192
01:03:40,468 --> 01:03:42,035
Wanna play with me?

1193
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:49,477
Well, I'll give it a shot.

1194
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:51,436
All right, come on.

1195
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,133

food options in Deer Falls

1244
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:33,266
that fall somewhere between the
burger joint and Chez Maman?

1245
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,487
Oh, this place is downright
cosmopolitan then.

1246
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:39,533
Oh, yeah. True center
of high art and culture.

1247
01:07:39,707 --> 01:07:41,318
Pick you up at seven?

1248
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:44,582
Yes, I will be ready.

1249
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:46,062
It's a date.

1250
01:07:50,718 --> 01:07:53,069
[sighs]

1251
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:04,471
Whoa.

1252
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:06,299
Becker?

1253
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:08,345
What are you doing here?

1254
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:17,876
Look, look.

1255
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,704
I was just worried about you.

1256
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:22,359
Okay, well, I'm fine, so
there's nothing to worry about.

1257
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:26,014
How did you find me anyway?

1258
01:08:27,364 --> 01:08:30,410
I saw a picture of
you on social media.

1259
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:34,849
You can change your hair, but
I would know you anywhere.

1260
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:38,462
Okay. So now you found me.

1261
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:39,811
What do you want?

1262
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:41,378
Why are you so hostile?

1263
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:43,467
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

1264
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:46,861
Okay. One, we broke up.

1265
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:50,604
Two, you humiliated me twice.

1266
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:51,953
Okay, okay.

1267
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,130
Look, I wanted to talk.

1268
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:55,957
Talk about what?

1269
01:08:56,132 --> 01:09:00,223
I wanted to apologize
for everything.

1270
01:09:00,397 --> 01:09:04,052
The fake proposal, ambushing
you at the concert,

1271
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:07,404
all of it. I was wrong.

1272
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:10,929
I appreciate that.

1273
01:09:11,103 --> 01:09:12,278
Come home, Ivy.

1274
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,150
Beck, I can't.

1275
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,935
You deserve to be with
someone who's just as excited

1276
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:20,460
about you as you are them...

1277
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:22,419
and someone who loves pranks.

1278
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:27,815
This is really not
how I saw this going.

1279
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:32,429
I'm sorry, but it's really
the best for both of us.

1280
01:09:32,603 --> 01:09:34,431
I respect your decision

1281
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:40,045
and the least I can do
is accept that it's over.

1282
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:44,615
Third time's a charm, I guess.

1283
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:46,834
Thanks, Beck.

1284
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:50,186
Take care of yourself, Ivy Rose.

1285
01:10:48,722 --> 01:10:52,596
See, when you said you were
gonna pick me up at seven,

1286
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:56,121
I didn't exactly
expect to be stood up.

1287
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:59,080
Yeah, well, you seemed
otherwise engaged

1288
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,039
so I figured I'd give
you your privacy.

1289
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:04,216
What are you talking about?

1290
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:08,525
I saw you and Becker
outside your house, Ivy.

1291
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:09,917
Oh, my.

1292
01:11:10,091 --> 01:11:13,399
Darren, it...

1293
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:15,053
It's really not
what it looked like.

1294
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:17,577
It doesn't matter what it was.

1295
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:21,625
What does matter is
what it made me realize.

1296
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:24,410
And what's that?

1297
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:26,238
That it was crazy
for me to think that

1298
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:30,198
there was a world in
which you stay here.

1299
01:11:30,373 --> 01:11:31,591
What are you talking about?

1300
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:33,985
I just told you
I wanted to stay.

1301
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:38,381
Yeah, and it seemed impulsive!

1302
01:11:38,555 --> 01:11:41,993
You weren't thinking
about the future.

1303
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,082
What's to stop you from
making another decision

1304
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:45,910
to just run away again?

1305
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:48,652
I would hope that you would
know me better than that.

1306
01:11:48,826 --> 01:11:50,306
I don't know what I know.

1307
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,438
Come on, it's time for
both of us to admit

1308
01:11:52,612 --> 01:11:55,267
that this was nothing more
than a vacation for you.

1309
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,008
That's not what this was!

1310
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:58,182
Of course, it was!

1311
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,967
And that's okay!

1312
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:02,274
You're allowed to have a
vacation from your life!

1313
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:06,017
This isn't a vacation for me.

1314
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:07,845
Okay, this is my life.

1315
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:10,413
Darren, you have no idea

1316
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:13,590
what these past few
weeks have meant to me.

1317
01:12:13,764 --> 01:12:16,157
They meant a lot to
me too, believe me.

1318
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,638
I've been falling for Jamie...

1319
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:22,903
but you're not Jamie.

1320
01:12:23,077 --> 01:12:24,077
You're Ivy.

1321
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:26,951
So what are you saying?

1322
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:29,997
I'm taking the offer, Ivy.

1323
01:12:30,171 --> 01:12:31,303
I'm selling the store.

1324
01:12:34,132 --> 01:12:36,308
Wait! I just... I
don't understand!

1325
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:38,963
You're always talking
about not selling out

1326
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:40,617
but that is exactly
what you're doing.

1327
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,967
Yeah, cause I was
being an idiot!

1328
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:45,012
You said it yourself!

1329
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:48,494
It's a miracle anyone walks
into a record store these days.

1330
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:51,279
And I can't keep
counting on miracles.

1331
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:54,413
That is not what
I meant by that.

1332
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:57,416
I need to focus on a
future I can count on.

1333
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:00,114
I don't think you should
come by the store anymore.

1334
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:03,204
Goodbye, Ivy.

1335
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:05,772
Darren?

1336
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:08,384
Darren?

1337
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:08,922
[knocking]

1338
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:10,533
Come in!

1339
01:14:14,798 --> 01:14:18,105
Ivy, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1340
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:19,890
Oh, thank goodness.

1341
01:14:20,064 --> 01:14:21,504
I saw a picture of
you in some outfit

1342
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:24,285
and I thought you'd
lost your mind.

1343
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,940
Well, looks like you still
have some sense in you.

1344
01:14:27,114 --> 01:14:29,943
Great. As if this day
couldn't get any worse.

1345
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:33,120
Hey, is that any way to
greet your loyal manager?

1346
01:14:33,294 --> 01:14:34,861
I've been so worried about you.

1347
01:14:35,035 --> 01:14:37,168
Well, there's clearly
nothing to worry about.

1348
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:38,648
I'm fine.

1349
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:40,103
Running off in the
middle of the night?

1350
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:41,564
No calls, no texts?

1351
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:44,131
I wouldn't call that fine.

1352
01:14:46,133 --> 01:14:48,875
Listen, if there's something
that I've done wrong...

1353
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:51,269
I told you that I
wanted more control

1354
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:53,924
over my career, over my life.

1355
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:57,928
You're right, and I
owe you an apology.

1356
01:14:58,102 --> 01:15:01,018
It's just that I always
want the best for you.

1357
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:04,325
And this business does take
a certain amount of hustle.

1358
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,066
I know what hustle is, Naomi.

1359
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,938
I know you do.

1360
01:15:08,112 --> 01:15:10,114
Listen, we can work things out.

1361
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:12,159
We just have to
reevaluate your schedule

1362
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:17,121
and find a way that you can
have a life on top of the life.

1363
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:19,863
- You mean it?
- Of course I do.

1364
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:21,995
Now there's a world
of people out there

1365
01:15:22,169 --> 01:15:24,215
who miss you very much.

1366
01:15:24,389 --> 01:15:26,173
Your people, Ivy.

1367
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:27,653
So can we get out of here now

1368
01:15:27,827 --> 01:15:30,134
and have things
get back to normal?

1369
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:33,354
Yeah.

1370
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,922
Guess I'm not
wanted here anyway.

1371
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:37,620
Attagirl.

1372
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:15,135
- Oh...
- Hi.

1373
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:16,876
Can I help you?

1374
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:19,270
Um, yeah... sorry.

1375
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:23,056
I'm looking for my
friend, uh... Jamie.

1376
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:24,318
She lives here.

1377
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:26,494
Jamie, yeah. I'm Addison.

1378
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:28,366
I'm the owner of
this vacation rental.

1379
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,499
Yes, she checked
out early in a rush.

1380
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:35,025
I'm not sure what happened.

1381
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,028
Oh... uh... okay.

1382
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,206
Sorry to bother you.

1383
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,034
Wait!

1384
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:46,863
You wouldn't happen to
be Karina, would you?

1385
01:16:47,037 --> 01:16:49,082
Yeah, that's me.

1386
01:16:49,256 --> 01:16:53,086
I think I have something
for you, something she left.

1387
01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:00,267
Oh.

1388
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:07,710
There you go.

1389
01:17:09,059 --> 01:17:09,886
Thank you.

1390
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,583
Yeah.

1391
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:52,929
"To the most talented,

1392
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:56,062
"refreshingly honest
lyricist I know.

1393
01:17:56,236 --> 01:17:58,436
"Thanks for trying to help
me connect with myself again.

1394
01:17:58,586 --> 01:17:59,892
"Take care of this for me.

1395
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:01,067
Jamie."

1396
01:18:16,343 --> 01:18:17,605
Darren, what happened with Ivy?

1397
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:20,870
She won't be coming
by the store anymore.

1398
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:23,263
Well, yeah. That
much is obvious.

1399
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:25,048
She left town.

1400
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:31,010
Well, we knew that
would happen eventually.

1401
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:32,359
Listen to you!

1402
01:18:32,533 --> 01:18:33,970
Are you even gonna miss her?

1403
01:18:34,144 --> 01:18:36,886
Karina, of course I am.

1404
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,060
I'm gonna miss her a lot.

1405
01:18:38,148 --> 01:18:39,323
Then why let her leave?

1406
01:18:39,497 --> 01:18:41,194
It's called being realistic.

1407
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:44,371
Just because you want something
doesn't mean you get it.

1408
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:46,069
I mean, sure, yeah,

1409
01:18:46,243 --> 01:18:47,960
these last couple of
weeks were a lot of fun.

1410
01:18:47,984 --> 01:18:49,550
- Fun?
- Yeah, fun.

1411
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:54,033
But Ivy needed to go for
a sure thing, and so do I.

1412
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,645
So that's it, then?

1413
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,865
You're just gonna sell the
store and call it quits.

1414
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:02,912
I'm not calling it quits.
I'm moving on with my life.

1415
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:04,391
Don't worry.

1416
01:19:04,565 --> 01:19:06,350
I'm sure there'll
be a job for you

1417
01:19:06,524 --> 01:19:08,328
at the new pop-up with a much
younger, hipper crowd too.

1418
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:10,441
No! I don't wanna work there!

1419
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:15,011
I wanna work here at a real
record store with you and Ivy!

1420
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:18,014
- Ivy's gone, Karina.
- And you let her go!

1421
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:27,110
Darren, I saw a different
you ever since Ivy showed up.

1422
01:19:27,284 --> 01:19:29,373
You were in a better mood.

1423
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:31,941
The store was doing
better than ever.

1424
01:19:32,115 --> 01:19:33,995
And you were letting good
things into your life.

1425
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:35,988
Yeah, I know.

1426
01:19:36,162 --> 01:19:39,122
But then you always fall back
on this idea of responsibility.

1427
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:43,561
You always have to have a
backup plan or a safety net.

1428
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:45,693
It's called being
an adult, Karina!

1429
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:50,327
The good things that happened
to you only happened to you

1430
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:52,004
because you took a chance.

1431
01:19:58,054 --> 01:20:01,057
She left this for you.

1432
01:20:16,463 --> 01:20:19,640
"Thanks for helping me find
exactly what I was looking for.

1433
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,165
"Sorry I didn't get
to say so in person.

1434
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:23,731
Jamie."

1435
01:20:29,563 --> 01:20:31,783
[cheering]

1436
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:37,571
Okay, these fans have
been waiting hours

1437
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:39,095
for a chance to get to meet you.

1438
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:41,314
So remember, big smiles,
make eye contact.

1439
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:44,404
Sign a few albums and you
make them feel special.

1440
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:46,929
Yeah. You've got it.

1441
01:20:47,103 --> 01:20:51,281
I am so glad things are back
to normal, back in the swing.

1442
01:20:55,459 --> 01:20:57,330
Hey, what's going on?

1443
01:20:57,504 --> 01:20:59,985
Nothing. I'm fine.

1444
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,032
You're not still thinking
about that boy, are you?

1445
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:04,468
His name is Darren.

1446
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:06,165
Oh, sorry. Darren.

1447
01:21:06,339 --> 01:21:08,428
Well, you don't have
to worry about him.

1448
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:10,517
He's gonna be just fine.

1449
01:21:10,691 --> 01:21:12,563
What are you talking about?

1450
01:21:12,737 --> 01:21:16,306
Well, a little birdie told me
he was having money problems.

1451
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,526
So I decided to take
care of those for him.

1452
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,138
Wait. What?

1453
01:21:22,312 --> 01:21:24,112
Are you the one who's
buying the record store?

1454
01:21:24,183 --> 01:21:27,970
Am buying. The sale
is still pending.

1455
01:21:28,144 --> 01:21:29,928
But we do have a
verbal agreement.

1456
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:32,670
He'd be an idiot to
pass up that much cash.

1457
01:21:32,844 --> 01:21:35,673
It's way above asking price.

1458
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:37,501
But why would you do that?

1459
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:40,199
It's an investment opportunity.

1460
01:21:40,373 --> 01:21:43,289
And it didn't hurt
that it eliminated...

1461
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:45,204
certain distractions.

1462
01:21:45,378 --> 01:21:48,947
You did this on purpose to
get back at me for leaving.

1463
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:51,210
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Ivy.

1464
01:21:51,384 --> 01:21:53,038
I didn't do this
to get back at you.

1465
01:21:53,212 --> 01:21:55,911
I did it to get you back.

1466
01:21:56,085 --> 01:21:59,262
It's a win-win situation
for everybody involved.

1467
01:21:59,436 --> 01:22:04,006
Oh, it's go time!
Remember, big smiles!

1468
01:22:08,271 --> 01:22:09,271
[crowd cheering]

1469
01:22:27,551 --> 01:22:29,857
[chanting] Ivy! Ivy! Ivy!

1470
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:32,556
Jamie! Jamie!

1471
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:36,516
Jamie! Jamie!

1472
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:38,431
Karina?

1473
01:22:38,605 --> 01:22:40,868
- Karina!
- Sorry, sorry.

1474
01:22:41,043 --> 01:22:42,958
What are you doing here?

1475
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:46,004
Well, I came to get
my album signed. Duh!

1476
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:48,572
But, no, you left
without saying goodbye.

1477
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:51,575
Yeah, I did. I
screwed everything up.

1478
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:53,403
I... I just needed
to leave town.

1479
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:56,101
You didn't screw anything
up! Are you kidding me?

1480
01:22:56,275 --> 01:22:57,929
You made our lives
so much better!

1481
01:22:58,103 --> 01:22:59,975
You made my life better too.

1482
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:01,933
And Darren misses you, you know.

1483
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:03,848
- Really?
- He misses you a lot.

1484
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:05,502
Is that why you came here?

1485
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:07,199
Uh, sort of.

1486
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:10,594
But, mostly, because you
didn't finish the song.

1487
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:14,206
And it is bad luck
not to finish a song

1488
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:17,862
on the instrument
you started it on.

1489
01:23:18,036 --> 01:23:19,037
I don't know what to say.

1490
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:20,451
You don't have to say anything.

1491
01:23:20,604 --> 01:23:22,910
Just finish it.

1492
01:23:23,085 --> 01:23:24,390
Jamie needs to finish it.

1493
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:27,219
It's not my song.
It's our song.

1494
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:29,395
And I can't finish
it without you.

1495
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:33,921
So, here, take this.
Get in. Get in the car.

1496
01:23:34,096 --> 01:23:35,532
Ivy!

1497
01:23:35,706 --> 01:23:37,229
What is this? Where
are you going?

1498
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:39,003
You don't have to
worry about it anymore.

1499
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:40,885
You can't just take the limo!

1500
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:43,366
Why can't I? I paid
for it, didn't I?

1501
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,151
Ivy, why are you doing this?

1502
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:50,112
Because I make my own
decisions now, okay?

1503
01:23:50,286 --> 01:23:52,114
And, Naomi, you're fired!

1504
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:58,424
Driver? Take us to Deer Falls!

1505
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,923
[Radio] More bizarre behavior
from pop star, Ivy Rose,

1506
01:24:19,097 --> 01:24:20,881
who left last
night's album signing

1507
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,406
without even making
it in the door.

1508
01:24:59,746 --> 01:25:04,882
Double cheeseburger, cheesy
fries and a cola, right?

1509
01:25:05,056 --> 01:25:07,145
It's really good
to see you, Ivy.

1510
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:10,279
Thank goodness. I thought
you were going to be mad.

1511
01:25:10,453 --> 01:25:11,889
No.

1512
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:14,065
Look, what happened
to you wasn't fair.

1513
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,981
I came in here and I forced
my way into your life

1514
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:17,982
because I wasn't
happy with my own.

1515
01:25:18,156 --> 01:25:20,245
I'm really glad you did.

1516
01:25:20,419 --> 01:25:25,511
It was fun and unpredictable
and it gave me hope.

1517
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:28,297
I think that I was just
so used to being let down

1518
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:32,910
that I just panicked and
snapped myself out of it.

1519
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:35,304
I get it. I really do.

1520
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:38,959
And I am ready to do everything
that I can not to let you down.

1521
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,874
You won't have to do that.

1522
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:42,485
I want to.

1523
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:44,071
For starters, I fired
my manager, Naomi.

1524
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:45,879
- What?
- Yeah.

1525
01:25:46,053 --> 01:25:47,683
It turns out she was the one
that was buying your store.

1526
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:50,232
Yet another way I was
screwing up your life.

1527
01:25:50,406 --> 01:25:52,451
I can't let you sell
the store, Darren.

1528
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:56,499
Look, I know it can be scary,

1529
01:25:56,673 --> 01:26:01,982
but that's the amazing
thing about taking chances.

1530
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:08,075
Like you said, the store,
it's a part of you.

1531
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,170
It's time to stop giving
pieces of ourselves away

1532
01:26:10,295 --> 01:26:12,167
to people who
don't deserve them.

1533
01:26:15,082 --> 01:26:16,867
You're right.

1534
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:22,177
I have made three very impulsive
decisions as of late, but...

1535
01:26:22,351 --> 01:26:25,223
all of them have led
me straight to you.

1536
01:26:25,397 --> 01:26:28,313
Oh, when you say it like that,
it sounds downright consistent.

1537
01:26:28,487 --> 01:26:33,188
But nothing about what I'm
about to say is impulsive.

1538
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:36,060
Darren...

1539
01:26:39,019 --> 01:26:43,067
I want to be here... with you.

1540
01:26:44,068 --> 01:26:46,157
I want you to be here with me.

1541
01:27:00,737 --> 01:27:02,826
That's even better
than our first kiss.

1542
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,306
