Coney Island, 1950's.

00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,014
The beach.

15
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:51,569
The boardwalk.

16
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:53,982
Once a luminous jewel

17
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:57,920
but growing relentlessly seedier
as the tides roll in and out.

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,483
Summers I work here,
on Bay 7.

19
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:04,568
Comes the fall, I'm a student
at New York University

20
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:06,912
going for my Master's
in European drama.

21
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:08,865
I'm Mickey Rubin.

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,489
Poetic by nature.

23
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,552
I harbor dreams
of being a writer.

24
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:15,255
A writer of truly great plays.

25
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,960
So I can one day
surprise everyone

26
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,983
and turn out
a profound masterpiece.

27
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:22,344
Anyhow.

28
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:24,016
Let me get to the story

29
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:27,094
in which I am a character,
so, be warned, as a poet,

30
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:29,779
I use symbols and as
a budding dramatist,

31
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:33,381
I relish melodrama and
larger-than-life characters.

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,481

Yup.

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,242
Excuse me.

40
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:02,258
Where's Humpty Javelin?
Does he work here?

41
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:06,246
Uh, Humpty works the carousel, uh,
but today he's working nights.

42
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,088
Do you know where he lives?

43
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,908
Uh...it's around here.

44
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:12,544
You can ask Ginny.

45
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:13,810
Ginny?

46
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,513
Yeah, h-his wife.

47
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:18,341
Um, she works at
Ruby's Clam House.

48
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:20,873
Just keep going down
that way there.

49
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:22,804
Thank you.

50
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:24,289
Yeah. You have a good one.

51
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,945
Excuse me, do you
know if Ginny's here?

52
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,397
Yeah. I'm Ginny.

53
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:07,859
I'm Carolina.

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,976
Who?

55
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,179
Carolina. Humpty's daughter.

56
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:17,632
Jesus.

57
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,057
Is he gonna be surprised.

58
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,080
I know he's gonna be upset.

59
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,002
But I had to come here.

60
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:28,821
I didn't want to but I...
don't have a choice.

61
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:33,619
I'll tell you the truth.

62
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:38,056
I don't think
he ever expected this.

63
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,424
You're his wife?

64
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,049
Why are you looking at me?

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,252
You're much younger
than I would've imagined.

66
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,182
Really?

67
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,213
I don't feel much younger.

68
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,085
I was thinking of my mother.

69
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,139
When she died,
she was practically

70
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,639
all gray.

71
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,600
I look like her.

72
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,948
Humpty should be back
in half an hour.

73
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:06,308
He went fishing off the
pier at Sheepshead Bay.

74
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,706
I'd always heard that
he'd moved to New Jersey.

75
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,808
No, we got run out
of our place there.

76
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:12,722
Oh.

77
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,198
Well, I'm not telling you
anything new about your father.

78
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,401
He fell off the wagon and
busted up the lobby.

79
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,216
Oh.

80
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:24,333
I guess you're
used to all this noise.

81
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,302
You never get used to it.

82
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,075
I hate it.

83
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,271
This whole honky-tonk fairyland.

84
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:33,404
We live up here.

85
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:50,491
The place used to house
a freak show.

86
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,505
We had to do
a lot of fixing up.

87
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,192
Oh, God.

88
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:58,254
I hope when sees me
he doesn't fly off the handle.

89
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,302
-No, I don't think--
-I hope he doesn't throw me out.

90
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,934
I-I don't know what I'll do.

91
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,380
I don't have
a dime to my name.

92
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:05,451
I literally don't have
ten pennies.

93
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:13,079
This-this-this goddamn noise!
I tell you.

94
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:14,728
You never get used to it.

95
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,470
Oh, my head's throbbing.

96
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,126
And my--my kid--

97
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:20,367
My kid had some trouble
in school today.

98
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:21,603
You and my father
have a child?

99
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:23,586
No, from my first husband.

100
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,110
Don't ever have kids.

101
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,712
Oh. Now my head's
cracking open.

102
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:29,603
I get migraines.

103
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,384
If you don't like Coney Island,
why don't you move?

104
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,156
From your mouth to God's ears.

105
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:42,578
Money, honey.

106
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,195
Mazuma, the wherewithal.

107
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,921
Ginny!

108
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:49,710
Ginny, big score.

109
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,289
Fluke,

110
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:52,656
flounder,

111
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:54,905
some uh, blue claws.

112
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:01,254
No.

113
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,465
No, what the hell
you doin' here?

114
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:09,045
I told you never to step
foot in my home again.

115
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,186
I'm in serious trouble,
I couldn't help it.

116
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:15,310
You let her in in here?

117
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:18,271
Christ!

118
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:22,823
I don't believe this.

119
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,214
You needs to go. Come on.

120
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,433
-Go.
-I can't.

121
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:31,540
If they fine me,
they're gonna kill me.

122
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:32,140
You--

123
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,915
You better hear her out, Humpty.

124
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:35,283
Mind your own business.

125
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,683
I got a bad headache!

126
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:39,113
And Richie did it again,
you were supposed to talk to him.

127
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,284
I talked to him.

128
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:41,636
Frank's gonna kill me.

129
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,573
I ran away and

130
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,525
I took nothing,
I-I have no clothes,

131
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,230
I've been sleeping
in the rain.

132
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:49,609
And I'm marked.

133
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,336
They're gonna kill me.

134
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:54,156
Well, that's what you get
when you marry a gangster.

135
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,343
Jesus, they're not gonna
come after you here, are they?

136
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:57,585
I don't want trouble.

137
00:06:57,874 --> 00:06:59,351
Do you hear what I'm saying?

138
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,015
They're gonna kill me.

139
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,383
There's a young kid here!

140
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:03,531
This is not our problem.

141
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,773
All right, all right,
all right, knock it off.

142
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,680
I-I gotta have a drink.

143
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,078
No, Humpty, you've been good.

144
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:12,789
I g--I.. I.. I need one.

145
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,570
I need one,
look what's goin' on here!

146
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:15,775
No booze!

147
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,633
I'll make you coffee.

148
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:20,798
Goddammit.

149
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:22,217
What the hell do you
expect to happen

150
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,991
when you marry
a cheap hoodlum?

151
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,787
I was twenty.

152
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,373
I didn't know better.

153
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:29,304
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,124
Why didn't you
go to the police?

155
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,632
I told the police too much,
that's the problem.

156
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,492
Why the hell
you open your mouth?

157
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,242
The police told me
that I could be looking at

158
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,281
five years
if I didn't cooperate.

159
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,374
What the hell do you know?

160
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,295
Since when do you know what
happens inside the rackets?

161
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:46,017
How could I not know?

162
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,115
Can't be married
to one of those guys

163
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:50,079
and not pick up
on what's going on.

164
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,443
Jesus Christ!

165
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,365
I told you not
to marry that racketeer!

166
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,177
I told you he was all mobbed up.

167
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,685
He stank of murder.

168
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,967
She found this-this
greaseball exciting.

169
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,545
He wasn't even good-lookin'!

170
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,977
He was a punk.

171
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:13,243
I need a drink!

172
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,243
Forget it, Humpty.

173
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:16,602
I need one, goddammit!

174
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:18,715
Calm down.

175
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,608
Jesus Christ.

176
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,667
God damn it, she could've
married a few guys

177
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:36,910
from school, from
the neighborhood, all of 'em.

178
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,348
Decent kids.

179
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,653
We raised her nice.

180
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:43,545
Your mother and I

181
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,044
we broke our backs
out of workin'

182
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,779
so you could go to college

183
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,569
and-and you know,
you didn't.

184
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,743
You threw it all away!

185
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,469
Look at ya--
you're such a beautiful girl!

186
00:08:58,352 --> 00:08:59,493
You had your pick.

187
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,985
I loved Frank, okay?

188
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,954
And all the guys you
hand-picked for me, they were--

189
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:07,665
dull, colorless, boring guys.

190
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:10,680
All of 'em, honest men,
every one of 'em.

191
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:13,548
Christ!

192
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:18,040
Your mother's
last dying request

193
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,110
on her deathbed

194
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,009
was that you didn't
run off with that

195
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,892
slime, Frankie Adatto.

196
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:29,901
You wouldn't give her that one
bit of satisfaction, would ya?

197
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,502
You wouldn't
let her die in peace.

198
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,385
I loved him.

199
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,946
I was twenty,
I... I wanted more.

200
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:40,235
More.

201
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,212
More. More what?

202
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:44,708
Jesus, Humpty.

203
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,373
There's a world out there.

204
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,084
This does not concern you.

205
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,466
All I know is
you lost your head.

206
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,693
Your head was in the clouds
over that gutter guinea

207
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,069
that flashy, cheap,
flashy little wop.

208
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,485
You didn't think I knew
he carried a gun up here?

209
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:02,664
Huh?

210
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,258
He'll know...
He'll know you came here.

211
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,359
No. It's the last place he'll look.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,750
He knows how you feel about me.

213
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:11,377
Yeah.

214
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:13,182
You mean he knows

215
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:16,245
how much he hated me
for callin' it the way I saw it.

216
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:19,333
Christ.

217
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,594
I counted on you when she died.

218
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,219
I was lost.

219
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,875
You dumped me for that trash.

220
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:32,469
That's why he wouldn't think
I'd come here.

221
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:35,999
He knows that we haven't
exchanged words in five years

222
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:38,055
'cause bad blood
between us ran too deep.

223
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:40,368
He shows up here,
I'll kill him.

224
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:43,461
Oh, God, don't say that.
I don't--I don't want trouble.

225
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,157
All right.

226
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:45,702
Okay, my nerves
are shot as it is

227
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,636
-and you better calm down.
-All right.

228
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:51,785
Just don't tell me what
I should or shouldn't do.

229
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,621
She's my daughter.

230
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:58,136
Oh...

231
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:58,925
Oh...Christ.

232
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,637
You are a light, baby.

233
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,839
You are a light in my life.

234
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,519
Do you know
how much I missed you?

235
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:12,847
Ha?

236
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,820
Jesus! Suddenly, I'm starvin'.

237
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:19,671
Clean the fish, Ginny.

238
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,695
Yeah, yeah, I...I'll make
everybody stew.

239
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,398
Yeah, no...cooking relaxes my nerves.

240
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,671
Clean the fish?
I got a headache.

241
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,355
Clean the fish, Ginny,

242
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,761
two or three at least and
put paper down this time,

243
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,223
last time you got
guts all over the floor.

244
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,739
Hey,

245
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,771
you remember Carolina?

246
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,536
Remember I used to bake?

247
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,471
I used to make you those
chocolate chip cookies?

248
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:45,307
Hm.

249
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:46,960
And I'd put a little salt on it.

250
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:47,937
Mm-hmm.

251
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,764
You're late!
And you're in real trouble!

252
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,585
You know you could
kill somebody starting fires!

253
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:55,402
What kind of craziness is that?

254
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:56,801
Hey, listen to me.

255
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:58,171
You could hurt someone.

256
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:00,703
W-Where'd you get this
idea to make fires?

257
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,493
Jesus, Humpty, you sound
so happy tonight.

258
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,079
What happened, your
number come in?

259
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:07,822
Better than my number came in.

260
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:09,766
My ship came home.

261
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,664
All right, well, have a good
night at the merry-go-round.

262
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,789
All right, you too, man.

263
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:14,656
That's it.

264
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:15,835
Leave it right there.

265
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,047
How long is she
gonna stay here?

266
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:31,704
I don't know.

267
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:33,295
Hey, maybe you can
get her a job

268
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,141
at that clam joint
you're workin' at.

269
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,699
You think that's a good idea?

270
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,922
You said they were looking
for a certain waitress.

271
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:41,765
But they're after her.
Shouldn't she move on?

272
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:43,469
Where?

273
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,563
I don't know, maybe
out of the country--Mexico?

274
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,610
What are you, nuts?

275
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:51,164
The hell's she
gonna do in Mexico?

276
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:53,895
Ah, they're not comin'
back here, she's right.

277
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:56,778
He knows how we feel
about each other.

278
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,230
Well, we did.

279
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,293
Different now.
Clouds been lifted.

280
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,400
I don't want guys comin'
around causin' trouble.

281
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,441
There's a kid here.

282
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:06,493
Ah, it's okay as long as
he doesn't burn himself

283
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:09,299
or kill somebody with those
goddamn fires of his.

284
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,701
He's a moody kid.

285
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,881
He's got a moody mother.

286
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,232
What's that supposed to mean?

287
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:18,709
Jesus Christ, I can't believe

288
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,865
Carolina's gonna
wind up a waitress.

289
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,179
Thank God Shirley's in her grave.

290
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,712
What about <i>me</i>
winding up a waitress?

291
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,735
It's not what I had in mind, either.

292
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:29,612
Hey,

293
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,815
you wanna go fishin' Friday night?

294
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,690
The boys are bringin' the wives.

295
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,933
I don't go fishin', Humpty.

296
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:39,764
How many times
we have to go over this?

297
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:42,046
Y-Y-You don't like fishin',
you don't like boating,

298
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,510
you don't like bowlin',
what the hell do you like?

299
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:47,336
Oh, you like the radio and
the movie stars, right?

300
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:50,851
Readin' those goddamn movie
magazines all the time.

301
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,844
I'm worried about Richie.

302
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:56,899
Yeah. Oh, let me tell you
something about your son.

303
00:13:57,914 --> 00:13:59,649
He's gonna burn down somethin'.

304
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,876
There you are.

305
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,314
I knew I'd find you here.

306
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,910
Why aren't you in school?

307
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:12,285
Wanna see this picture?
It's the last day.

308
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,521
You can't not go to school.
Jesus, Richie.

309
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,958
That's why you're
in summer school

310
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,091
'cause you missed so many days.

311
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:19,895
They called again and
they asked, "Is he sick?"

312
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,115
I don't like school.

313
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,099
Doesn't matter
if you don't like it.

314
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,193
You know, I don't like
waiting on tables, but...

315
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:26,979
we need to eat
and pay the rent.

316
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,662
Some things in life you have to
do whether you like it or not.

317
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:31,146
Let me watch the picture!

318
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,029
Where do you get the money
for the movies anyhow?

319
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:35,529
I took 50 cents out of Humpty's
pants when he was asleep.

320
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:37,880
What? You steal
from your father?

321
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:39,448
He's not my father
and I hate him.

322
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,261
Don't you dare say that.

323
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:43,276
You know, he saved my life.

324
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,033
He's gr--he always--

325
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:46,558
He's a good person.

326
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:49,481
-Why does he hit you?
-He doesn't hit me.

327
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,308
Yeah, when he gets drunk,
he hits everybody

328
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:55,355
but h-he hardly...
he hardly drinks anymore.

329
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,425
I can't sit here arguing with you
I have to go to work.

330
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,542
Go to school, okay?

331
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:03,920
If I catch you playing
with matches...

332
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:07,584
Yes, it's a problem.

333
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,483
The kid makes fires.

334
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:11,922
And not such little ones.

335
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:21,879
He played hooky
from summer school

336
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:25,012
and even made fires on the
beach where it's forbidden.

337
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,508
What the hell
does the kid see

338
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,696
when he just stares
into the flames?

339
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:33,969
Is it the eternal power
of the universe?

340
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:36,837
The conversion of mass
into energy?

341
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:38,438
The Furies at work?

342
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:42,429
Whatever his motive,
it is not appreciated.

343
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:44,821
Hey!

344
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,512
♪ Soapsuds all around ♪

345
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:50,668

347
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:56,255
W-What's the condition?

348
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:59,986
Jesus, Richie, I c--
I can't remember.

349
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,931
I went to school years ago.

350
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,662
God if you-if you pay
attention in class...

351
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:06,889
You hated school.

352
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,396
What? No, I didn't, I liked it.

353
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:10,834
I liked school

354
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,256
but-but I had to quit,
we were poor

355
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:14,584
you know, I had to work.

356
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,715
I was lucky.

357
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:18,465
I was lucky. I-
I had some talent.

358
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,275
You know, I-I was a-
I was a--

359
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,220
I was a very promising
young actress.

360
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:27,680
Oh, God. Oh, God, if you could've
seen me in some of those shows...

361
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:30,041
Let me show you a couple of
pieces but this is-this--

362
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,470
-Again?
-this is from Dulcey, okay?

363
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,353
You know, I know I
showed you these pieces

364
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:36,291
but I never know if you're
paying any attention.

365
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,660
I wore this in Dulcey, look at
that, it's not real, but, you know.

366
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,800
-I've seen it.
-Isn't it beautiful?

367
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:45,187
God, look at that, it's--
let me show you this uh...

368
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,124
Wait, did I show you the, uh,
the piece from the musical?

369
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,545
-Yes.
-from--okay?

370
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,780
I don't know if I did,
I had an incredible voice,

371
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:55,007
you know, I almost
got the lead in that show

372
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:57,290
and the-the girl who
got the part...

373
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,642
she was fat.

374
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:01,043
I had a much better
voice than her.

375
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:02,754
Is that where you met Dad?

376
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,004
Yeah.

377
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:05,731
Yeah.

378
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:08,324
Yeah, your-your real
father was a drummer.

379
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,888
He played jazz music.

380
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,326
God, he had perfect rhythm.

381
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:15,919
Oh! It was quite amazing.

382
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:18,568
And he also had black hair and...

383
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,122
he had...he had green eyes...

384
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:25,373
-Oh.
-Where is my father?

385
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,114
My real father?

386
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,888
I told you many times.

387
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,177
Gone.

388
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,911
A rainy day at the beach.

389
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,927
Time off for me.

390
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,419
Nobody swims during
a lightning storm.

391
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:44,966
I guess this is as good
a time as any to tell you.

392
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:47,247
I'm having an affair with Ginny.

393
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,692
Humpty's wife.

394
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:50,984
Let me fill you in on that.

395
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:53,632
It started at the
beginning of the summer.

396
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:56,606
At that point, I didn't know
either Humpty or Ginny.

397
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:01,902
♪ I saw the harbor lights ♪

398
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:07,020
♪ They only told me
we were parting ♪

399
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:12,863
♪ The same old harbor lights ♪

400
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,810
♪ That once brought you to me ♪

401
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:24,122
♪ I watched the harbor lights ♪

402
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:29,482
♪ How could I help
if tears were starting ♪

403
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,248
♪ Goodbye to tender nights ♪

404
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,976
And then, at the end of a
cloudy day, it started to rain.

405
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,414
And the last few stragglers were
packing up and leaving the beach.

406
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,045
And suddenly, this
kind of interesting woman

407
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,162
comes walking along
the water's edge.

408
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:48,525
And the dramatist in me

409
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:50,643
sensed she was in
some kind of trouble

410
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:53,057
because her body language
read "vulnerable"

411
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:54,395
and "desperate."

412
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:57,074
Miss...

413
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,270
you can't be out here right now.

414
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,200
Everybody has to go in.

415
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:05,127
We're expecting lightning storms.

416
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:06,857
What?

417
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,169
Yeah, we gotta-we gotta go in.
We gotta clear the beach.

418
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:11,496
Really?

419
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:13,691
Yeah, we gotta go in.

420
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:19,667
Yeah, I've...I've been
all over the world.

421
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,410
I went to NYU and

422
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:25,487
right when I started, boom.
The japs hit Pearl Harbor.

423
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:28,705
So, after I got out,
went back to school and

424
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,776
now I'm workin' to
get my Master's.

425
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,333
But I-I don't resent
my years in the Navy.

426
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,255
I mean, I really saw the world.

427
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,623
You ever travel?

428
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:38,138
Not really.

429
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:39,951
No place magical.

430
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,489
You wanna know the
best place I ever saw?

431
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,005
Where's that?

432
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:45,700
Bora Bora.

433
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,794
I heard of it.

434
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:51,341
It's over by Tahiti where
Gauguin ran away to paint.

435
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:55,716
The water there...
so clear and unspoiled.

436
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:59,967
You can look down and see
all the bright-colored fish.

437
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,085
Bright red and yellow fish.

438
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,539
And-And the flowers are amazing.

439
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:05,985
And at night,

440
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,547
you never saw stars like
that on this planet.

441
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:11,298
You can actually read
by starlight.

442
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:13,900
And what are you gonna write?

443
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:17,244
Plays about human life.

444
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:19,517
Great tragic plays where

445
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:23,205
the protagonist gets crushed
because of some fatal weakness.

446
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,598
Like what?

447
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:31,720
My tragic flaw is
I'm too romantic a character.

448
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:35,339
You ever hear that song, uh,
"I Fall in Love Too Easily"?

449
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,436
You always...

450
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:40,639
think a person's tragedy
is their own fault.

451
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:41,908
No.

452
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,338
Fate plays a big role.

453
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:48,041
But more stuff in life is out of our
control than we'd like to admit.

454
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:50,342
Except...

455
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,474
I brought my troubles on myself.

456
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:56,850
Yeah.

457
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:59,225
I guessed that when I saw you.

458
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:03,763
I thought, "She's very pretty, but
somewhere there's a tragic flaw."

459
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:07,736
Yeah...

460
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:09,439
I made a mistake.

461
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,705
But that was years ago.

462
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,935
I'll never make that mistake again.

463
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:18,559
Yes...?

464
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:21,825
I have to go.

465
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:23,762
Hey...

466
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,305
You think you'll make it down
to the beach again soon?

467
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:31,219
Yeah, I might.

468
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:32,901
I might.

469
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,861
Where'd you go today?
Came home late.

470
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:41,400
I took a walk on the beach.

471
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,721
That's unlike you.

472
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:46,769
I was in a funny mood.

473
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:47,840
Meh.

474
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,632
Hey...

475
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,343
You wanna go to Yankee
Stadium Sunday?

476
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:54,752
It's the Red Sox.

477
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,736
It's not me, Humpty.

478
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:59,314
For the millionth time,
I don't care about baseball.

479
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:00,641
You used to go!

480
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:03,627
I tried to get interested
for your sake. I couldn't do it.

481
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:09,127
You wanna go,
I got an extra ticket?

482
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,986
I wanna go to the movies.

483
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:13,482
You know what?

484
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,318
You're gonna hurt your
eyes in so many movies.

485
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:18,616
You're just like your mother,

486
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,657
she lives on that
crap on the radio.

487
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:23,250
She thinks it's real.

488
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:27,604
I wanna be honest
with you, Mickey.

489
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,555
I'm married.

490
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:32,672
I'm a married woman.

491
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,868
I wanna be honest
with you, Mickey.

492
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:39,265
I'm a married woman.

493
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:41,702
I'm married, Mickey.

494
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,472
I feel strange mentioning it.

495
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,222
Now that you asked.

496
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:52,309
I got myself into
a bad situation.

497
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,848
I got myself--I got myself
into a bad situation.

498
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,681
You're right, I had...

499
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:01,986
I had notions about
ending everything.

500
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:04,171
I thought about drowning.

501
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,536
Of course, with a kid,
that's not an option.

502
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:12,566
Besides...

503
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:15,699
you would've dived in
and ruin my dramatic finale.

504
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:21,890
I feel trapped.

505
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:23,191
I feel trapped.

506
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:26,371
♪ I saw the harbor lights ♪

507
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,520
Ginny did come back
to the beach.

508
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:30,071
And she looked sexy.

509
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:33,837
And I knew a spot
on the far end of the boardwalk.

510
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:38,544
♪ The same old harbor lights ♪

511
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:43,119

513
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,082
I have something to tell you.

514
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:58,172
Two things...to tell.

515
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:03,241
Nothing you could
tell me could put

516
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:06,015
the slightest shadow
on this evening.

517
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:08,843
I'm not 35.

518
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:12,626
I'm 38.

519
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:15,884
I'm 39.

520
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:18,752
Well.

521
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:21,268
That's a very hot age
for a woman.

522
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,041
I'm a very lucky guy.

523
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,445
I-I'm old-older than you.

524
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:28,976
What's the second thing?

525
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:31,389
I'm married.

526
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:33,804
You are?

527
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:35,913
I have a husband.

528
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:38,769
And a child from
my first marriage.

529
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:42,667
You thought uh, you thought
it would spoil everything, right?

530
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:45,754
Has it?

531
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:51,309
It's not the first time I found
a married woman beautiful.

532
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:54,504
I ruined my life by--

533
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:57,730
by being unfaithful once and

534
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,777
now I'm doing it again.

535
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:03,723
You brought about your own
downfall by being unfaithful?

536
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:09,418
It was someone I loved.

537
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:13,912
A drummer

538
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:18,271
whose rhythm pulsated with life.

539
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:22,677
And we married and
had a child and...

540
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:24,974
he adored me.

541
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,685
And yet...

542
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:28,833
yet I cou--

543
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:30,911
couldn't resist the
beautiful young man

544
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,504
in the cast who
played Marchbanks.

545
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:36,973
God, he wasn't even the
leading man but he--

546
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,903
but he kissed me
onstage every night

547
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:41,403
and I started looking forward
to those kisses and

548
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:42,847
and uh...

549
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:45,025
I wound up in his bed and

550
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:49,619
and then my-
my husband found out and

551
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:52,316
and it crushed him.

552
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:57,543
Oh, he deserved so
much better than me.

553
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,739
I b-I broke his heart.

554
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,659
Humiliated, he ran away.

555
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:12,151
I didn't blame him for going
as far from me as he could.

556
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:14,226
And when he left,

557
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,382
I learned for the first
time what love was.

558
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:23,227
But I was too late.

559
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:26,165
Because he was gone.

560
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,094
And I started coming apart.

561
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,173
Oh, I-I couldn't act anymore,

562
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:35,103
I couldn't keep my
mind on my role. I...

563
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:38,087
I-I-I forget my lines,

564
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:39,978
miss my cues,

565
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,087
and I drank,

566
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,650
and-and I lost work.

567
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:47,704
And Harold--

568
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:52,430
Humpty who was
also a lost soul

569
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,939
met me at a diner and thought
I was the prettiest thing.

570
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,509
The belle of the ball.

571
00:26:58,728 --> 00:27:01,221
And we helped one another
scramble back onto our feet

572
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,111
and it's been five years and-
and I owe him a lot.

573
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:09,454
But just as I learned from my
first husband what love was...

574
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:11,324
I...

575
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,152
I learned from Humpty
what it was not.

576
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:18,096
It's not gratitude,
it's not company.

577
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:22,275
And it's not going through the
motions of love-making when

578
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:24,010
you have so much to give

579
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:27,025
and no one you really
want to give it to.

581
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:44,213

pretty intense summer

582
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:46,089
and not just the humidity.

583
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:49,798
I was involved in a relationship
with an older ex-actress--

584
00:27:49,823 --> 00:27:52,863
unhappily married,
and love-starved.

585
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:56,735

I've never been to

592
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:14,869
It's got a lot of meaning
for me, all the

593
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:17,371
artists and writers
I love hung out here

594
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,117
and it's close to school.

595
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:25,792
Remember, it's nothing
but a rented hole.

596
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,125
Wow.

597
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,148
Well, it's cozy.

598
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,914
That was very tactful.

599
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:45,815
These beautiful gardens.

600
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:48,244
How do you find these places?

601
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,742
My fantasy is that

602
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:54,679
is you write a play

603
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:56,664
with a character in it
I could play.

604
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,169
"Making her triumphant
return to the stage...

605
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:02,489

Virginia DeLorean--

00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,396

-Wow.

611
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:13,929
I love it. That was
your maiden name?

612
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:16,108
No, my real name
was Westlake but-

613
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:19,202
but I took DeLorean as a-
as a stage name.

614
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:19,858
Hm.

615
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:23,228
God, all that summer stock
and hard work so

616
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,752
so I could afford acting
lessons just so I could

617
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:28,717
just so I could wind up
playing the part of a waitress

618
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,326
in a clam house.

619
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:33,137
I am playing a part.

620
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:34,801
You know, it’s not me.

621
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:37,114
It's not me-you think-
what-you think it's me?

622
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:38,341
-No, I...
-Oh, God.

623
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:41,194
I-I mean, I act it everyday
but I'm acting.

624
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,774
I'm not a waitress in a-
in a clam house.

625
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,259
There's more to me than that.

626
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:50,021
I-I-I mean, I-I'm just playing the
thankless role of-of the waitress.

Promise me
we'll come back here.

Frank Adatto says hello.

654
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:16,182
He's very upset because
his wife's gone missin'

655
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:18,020
and we're tryin' to find her.

656
00:31:20,466 --> 00:31:21,262
Ah.

657
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:24,207
Since uh, she's you daughter,

658
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:26,215
we thought we'd check with you.

659
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:30,560
Well... I haven't seen
Carolina in years.

660
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,990
We're not in good terms.

661
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:35,971
Frank must've told you that.

662
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:39,229
I haven't spoken
to her in five years.

663
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:41,166
I don't know.

664
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:44,714
I lost track of her after
she ran off and got married.

665
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:46,516
-Uh-huh, really?
-Yeah.

666
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,853
Do me a favor, I'm talkin' to you,
stop workin' all right?

667
00:31:53,886 --> 00:31:55,401
You try California?

668
00:31:56,573 --> 00:31:59,831
She was talkin' about livin' in
San Francisco or Los Angeles.

669
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:03,058
I don't know, I wouldn't
even recognize her.

670
00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:06,213
We just thought
maybe she'd turn up here.

671
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:07,549
Yeah. Well.

672
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:08,915
She wouldn't find me.

673
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,743
I moved three or four
times in five years.

674
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:14,551
I mean, how the hell
<i>you</i> find me?

675
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:17,200
Frank's very worried about her.

676
00:32:17,822 --> 00:32:18,619
Well...

677
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:21,197
She'll never turn up here.

678
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,252
And if she does,

679
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,683
I'll tell her Frank's
lookin' for her, all right?

680
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,206
Hey, Humpty!

681
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:29,027
Did you hit him again?

682
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:30,992
I told you.

683
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,663
I told you next time I catch him
takin' money out of my pocket.

684
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:37,046
And I told <i>you</i> not to hit him.

685
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:38,360
All right.

686
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:40,367
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

687
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:42,173
I'm talkin' to these
gentlemen here.

688
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,634
Go on, we'll discuss it later.

689
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,821
How do you do?

690
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,254
This is my wife.

691
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:49,192
Stepson.

692
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:50,145
Go on, go on home--

693
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:52,012
We're lookin' for
Carolina Adatto.

694
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:53,176
I told him.

695
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:56,137
-Humpty's daughter?
-I told him!

696
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:58,606
I haven't seen her
in five years.

697
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,512
Yeah, yeah, h-h-he disowned her.

698
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:02,988
She'd never show her face
around here. Let's go.

699
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,582
Is that a gun?

700
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,973
Sharp kid.
They're very dangerous.

701
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,699
You people would never
try to hide her, would ya?

702
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,859
Hide her for what?
What'd she do?

703
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:14,725
You know, you're a nice family.

704
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,116
I wouldn't like to see you
get into trouble.

705
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:20,014
Can I see the gun?

706
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:23,353
No, he can't!
Let's go, Richie.

707
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,149
See ya later, Humpty.

708
00:33:27,814 --> 00:33:30,447
Hey,
what can I tell ya?

709
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:36,090
She's not here!

710
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:38,520
Frank says there's
bad blood between 'em.

711
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:40,621
Maybe California's
a better idea.

712
00:33:40,678 --> 00:33:42,561
And I'm startin' to think
we ain't gonna find her.

713
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,585
No, I'm gonna find her.

714
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:47,235
I wanna get some oysters,

715
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,852
they probably got
great oysters here.

716
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,517
I love oysters.

717
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:53,025
Eh, but do we got time?

718
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,063
Vinnie?

719
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:57,211
Christ, 5:00 we gotta
meet him in Hoboken.

720
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,602
You know how he gets
when we're late, come on.

721
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:02,524
Gah, I coulda went for oysters.

722
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:05,540
Hey, John, I need two beers.

723
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,339
Hey, what's your name?

724
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:08,496
Why?

725
00:34:08,894 --> 00:34:10,230
What time do you get off?

726
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:12,621
I don't get off,
I go right to school.

727
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,730
Night school?

728
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:14,902
That's right.

729
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,363
What are you studyin'?

730
00:34:16,712 --> 00:34:18,025
To be an English teacher.

731
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,450
-What time is class over?
-Here you go, two beers.

732
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:21,599
I got a lotta homework.

733
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,873
I'm strikin' out here.

734
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,560
When do you graduate?

735
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:29,264
And so, the Angel of Death passed
over them and headed out west.

736
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,444
But his shadow was scary.

737
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:34,781
It took a few days of
summer sun to decompress.

738
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,514
Life on the boardwalk
provided the tourist

739
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:40,030
with cheap thrills
and great hotdogs.

740
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:44,031
When she wasn't breaking
dishes or customers' hearts,

741
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,030
Carolina took a limited
program at night school.

742
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:50,121
And when Humpty wasn't
tryin' to get riders

743
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,537
for those empty horses
on the carousel,

744
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:54,876
he was off chasing
fluke and flounder.

745
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:57,056
Your wife don't like
to go fishing anymore, huh?

746
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:58,181
Aah!

747
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:01,611
She never really liked it,
she made like she liked it.

748
00:35:01,837 --> 00:35:03,462
To get me on the hook.

749
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:04,361
Yeah.

750
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:05,704
I was the fish.

00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:28,051
Now I love it 'cause
it means you get time off.

756
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:30,449
Well, the perks of
being a lifeguard.

757
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:32,769

your eyes and

758
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:34,074
it's beautiful.

759
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,970
You know, you'd go
crazy over Bora Bora?

760
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,064

762
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,621
I'd go off with you on
any place you ask me to.

763
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,960
You say you're miserable
at home with Humpty.

764
00:35:51,155 --> 00:35:52,975
Why do you stay with the guy?

765
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:55,653
Me and Richie?

766
00:35:56,802 --> 00:35:57,692
A joke.

767
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:00,993
Waiting on tables,
trying to suck

768
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:04,251
nickel and dime tips out of redneck
clowns wearing lobster bibs?

769
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:07,680
Yeah, I know, it is pretty sleazy
what happened to Coney Island.

770
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:09,681
Hey, I don't wanna
spoil the rainy day.

771
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,806
Tell me about the
Chekhov play you read.

772
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,337
No. You tell me.

773
00:36:13,612 --> 00:36:14,909
Ever play Chekhov?

774
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:16,815
I can't remember.

775
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:18,870
Maybe once in Baltimore.

776
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:20,563

I know he has feelings for me.

782
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,386
And I-I-I know it's not
just a summer thing.

783
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:42,033
Oh, God, I hope I'm not
misreading it all.

784
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:43,525
I mean, I try to...

785
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:45,002
I try to push him

786
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:47,210
without being one of
those pushy women.

787
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:50,743
You know, I don't-don't
want my desperation to show.

788
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:52,607
There's progress, but...

789
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,685
it's slow.

790
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:56,495
You know?

791
00:36:57,513 --> 00:36:58,982
As the summer ends and it...

792
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,153
it fizzles out and I'm
left at square one.

793
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,521
I don't know what I'll do.

794
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:04,561
Well, you'll survive
like we all do.

795
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:07,178
No. No, I'm not a strong person.

796
00:37:07,254 --> 00:37:09,207
I wouldn't have survived my
breakdown if it wasn't for Humpty.

797
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:12,170
Now I'm feeling claustrophobic,
my headaches are back,

798
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,796
You just have to be realistic

799
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:15,929
in case things
don't go your way.

800
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,452
There is nothing realistic
about a Chinese garden

801
00:37:18,515 --> 00:37:20,624
in the middle of
Staten Island, but...

802
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:24,253
but it's-it's-it's where
I wanna be with him.

803
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:26,113

he's the lifeguard on Bay 7.

00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:20,728
Oh.

825
00:38:20,806 --> 00:38:23,424
This is my husband's
daughter, Carolina.

826
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:25,228
I swim at Bay 7 sometimes.

827
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,892
-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

828
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:29,783
We have to go.

829
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,025
Just don't drown on
Bay 7 or they'll fire me.

830

She's a very patriotic girl.

Yeah, well, she's pretty, Humpty,

843
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,794
you gotta expect some
trouble, you know.

844
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:11,622
-Yeah, that's right.
-Her mother was pretty.

Hm.

848
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,007
I play the IQ number,
but it never comes in.

849
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:21,242
No, I'm sure she can handle
herself, she's been married.

850
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,565
Yeah, and knows the score.

851
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,291
Yeah, he's right, you know,
once a woman's divorced,

852
00:39:24,316 --> 00:39:25,634
come on, she's
fair game, you know.

853
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:26,822
-That's right.
-I'm glad I got boys, though.

854
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,584
She's going to night school.

855
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:30,123
She's gonna be an
English teacher

856
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:32,412
Yeah, right, if some soldier
doesn't knock her up first.

857
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:33,438

858
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,000
Come on, just kiddin'!

859
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:36,293
Look how red he got.

860
00:39:36,886 --> 00:39:38,597
What kinda thing is that to say?

861
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,684
She don't look like any English
teacher I had in school.

862
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,424
Yeah, yeah, what
school did you go to?

863
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:43,760
You didn't go to
school, you idiot.

864
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:44,924
I went to the School
of Hard Knocks.

865
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,815
Ah.

866
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:48,151

867
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:50,095
Hey!

868
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,627
-Remember me?
-Of course.

869
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:54,202
We met outside the movie
theater the other night.

870
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,336
-Yes!
-Oh. Gosh.

871
00:39:56,457 --> 00:39:57,676
Yes, with Ginny.

872
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:00,700
You said you
sometimes use Bay 7.

873
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:03,206
Yes, you remember.

874
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,925
I was hoping to get some tan.

875
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:08,527
-It's gotten so overcast.
-Yeah, storm clouds.

876
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:10,691
What is it?

877
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,454
<i>Hamlet and Oedipus</i> by
Ernest Jones.

878
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:17,314
My goodness, that sounds deep.

879
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:20,564
It's not that deep when you're
familiar with the total picture.

880
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:22,283
What total picture is that?

881
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,730
Well, Hamlet of course.

882
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:27,457
I haven't read Hamlet
since high school.

883
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:29,473
But you've seen it performed?

884
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:31,770
Once, and not very well.

885
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:34,887
I love the theater but
I haven't seen that many shows.

886
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:37,153
I-Ignorance is no sin.

887
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:39,374
It just means your experience
hasn't brought into contact

888
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:40,827
-with certain things.
-Hm.

889
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,343
-Did you finish school?
-No, I got sidetracked.

890
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:47,439
Yeah, me too.
Uncle Sam.

891
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:49,092
What's your story?

892
00:40:50,061 --> 00:40:51,928
I got married too quickly.

893
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,553
But it's all over.

894
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:55,076
Wow.

895
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,218
Marriage is a big step, isn't it?

896
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,812
-Hmm.
-Scary.

897
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,679
What'd your husband do?

898
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,297
Shouldn't you be looking
out for drowning people?

899
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:08,195
No one ever drowns here.
But I should, yes.

900
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:09,241
Listen,

901
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm actually through
with this book, so

902
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:13,580
if you want, you can borrow it
and then when you're finished,

903
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,126
then we could
discuss it more fully.

904
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:16,666
-Really?
-Yeah.

905
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:18,100
I'd like that.

906
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:24,083
♪ Till I waltz again with you ♪

907
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:29,966
♪ Let no other hold your charms ♪

908
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:34,708
♪ If my dreams
should all come true ♪

909
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:40,474
♪ You'll be waiting for my arms ♪

910
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:45,545
You know who I ran into
yesterday at the beach?

911
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:47,131
The lifeguard, Mickey.

912
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:48,959
-You did?
-Yeah.

913
00:41:49,217 --> 00:41:51,451
I was leaving and I noticed
him, so I said hello.

914
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,576
He was sitting up there reading and
he dropped down and we talked.

915
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,404
He was very nice.

916
00:41:57,396 --> 00:41:58,170
Yeah?

917
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:00,209
And he's well-educated.

918
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:02,826
He's studying at college
to write plays.

919
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:04,771
Uh-huh.

920
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:06,920
I thought that would interest
you since you acted.

921
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:10,451
And he had a book about Hamlet,
a psychological study.

922
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:12,154
Uh-huh.

923
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,262
I hadn't read Hamlet for years

924
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:17,091
and he tried not to
make me feel so dumb.

925
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:18,961
He was sweet.

926
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,047
-How long'd you chat?
-Five minutes.

927
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,423
I had to go home and shower
and dress for a date--

928
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:28,337
a nice guy from night school,
took me to the movies.

929
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:30,337
Not that I'd like
to see him again.

930
00:42:31,794 --> 00:42:34,457
That's...that's all you
talked about with Mickey?

931
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:35,419
Yeah.

932
00:42:36,294 --> 00:42:37,255
Actually...

933
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:40,075
I kind of found him attractive.

934
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,786
Did you?

935
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,973
Uh, I'm probably
reading into it, but

936
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:47,241
I think he kind of liked me.

937
00:42:47,717 --> 00:42:50,303
He said I could borrow his book
and we could talk about it.

938
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,037
That flounder was great.

939
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:57,943
You know, that's the beauty of being
able to catch yourself a fresh.

940
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,424
It's not just the money,
it's the flavor.

941
00:43:02,468 --> 00:43:04,358
-Carolina.
-Uh-huh?

942
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:08,577
Carney and Ryan and Leo
think you're a knockout.

943
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:12,952
Yeah, they kid me about
seeing you with that soldier.

944
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:14,141
-Oh, Rusty Ford.
-Mm-hmm.

945
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,407
No, he's a real hero,
he fought in Okinawa.

946
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:18,587
Hey, what am I, the hired help?

947
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:21,222
You ever think of
clearing you own stuff?

948
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:24,418
I'm sorry, every time I try,
you send me back down.

949
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:27,152
That's because we can't afford
to have any more dishes broken

950
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:30,106
but you could overrule
me and just...be careful.

951
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:31,966
Oh, of course, no,
I'm happy to help.

952
00:43:32,263 --> 00:43:34,564
I'd do the dishes but
I just did my nails.

953
00:43:34,634 --> 00:43:36,408
Well, I don't feel like
doing them tonight.

954
00:43:36,642 --> 00:43:38,236
She just did her nails.

955
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:40,423
When you're married
to a man who got rich

956
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:41,626
putting people's
feet in cement,

957
00:43:41,657 --> 00:43:43,408
you probably never
had to do a dish.

958
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:44,479
I'll do it.

959
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:46,687
-I'll do it.
-I got it.

960
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:49,382
"Starring as a waitress."

961
00:43:49,945 --> 00:43:51,390
Something's eatin' her.

962
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:54,173
It's my fault. I should insist
on doing more around here.

963
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,564
-Well, pfff...
-No, she's right, I'm not used to it.

964
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,354
I'm between work
and studying, I...

965
00:43:58,393 --> 00:44:01,128
Well, listen...just get
home early, that's all.

966
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:04,911
Hey, was everything okay?

967
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:06,333
Yeah.

968
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:07,966
Why?

969
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,208
You seemed a little distracted.

970
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,443
Carolina told me you ran
into her at the beach.

971
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:17,987
Ran into her?

972
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:19,870
I nearly hit her in the
head with my book.

973
00:44:20,854 --> 00:44:22,370
She said you lent it to her.

974
00:44:22,596 --> 00:44:24,189
Yeah, she was interested.

975
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:27,206
You shouldn't read out there.
People trust you with their lives.

976
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,741
So, what'd you
talk to her about?

977
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:31,178
Nothing. Uh, my book--Hamlet.

978
00:44:31,225 --> 00:44:32,795
She said she quit
school to get married.

979
00:44:32,873 --> 00:44:33,975
To a gangster.

980
00:44:34,997 --> 00:44:37,474
Really? How interesting.

981
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,857
You find that interesting?

982
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:41,021
They're after her.
They want to kill her.

983
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,165
You better be careful.

984
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:44,517
I get the creeps living in that
apartment. I wish she'd move on.

985
00:44:44,704 --> 00:44:47,071
-She never mentioned it.
-Well, she wouldn't.

986
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:49,610
She's embarrassed by how
she screwed up her life.

987
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:51,637
They're gonna find her
and kill her?

988
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:53,145
Y-You must be exaggerating.

989
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:55,129
It's a long story.

990
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:57,793
She's a canary. She sings.

991
00:44:58,086 --> 00:45:01,289
That's terrible.
She's young, she's pretty.

992
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:02,938
She should go
where she's safe.

993
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:05,000
I asked you the other
day if she was pretty

994
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:06,930
and you said, "Okay".

995
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:08,930
Was so quick, I didn't
really get a good look.

996
00:45:09,602 --> 00:45:11,953
But at the beach she
had on a bathing suit.

997
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:13,932
Yeah, well, sort of.

998
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:15,971
You didn't get any
ideas, did you?

999
00:45:16,186 --> 00:45:18,335
-What kind of ideas?
-What do you think?

1000
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,827
Hey, give me a break.
What are you doing?

1001
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,565
She's not for you.
She's hiding out here.

1002
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:25,659
Her life’s all topsy-turvy.

1003
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:27,659
I was just chatting with her.

1004
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:30,221
Well, I hope you didn't
say anything about us.

1005
00:45:30,388 --> 00:45:31,778
You know, she'll tell her father.

1006
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:33,614
-That's what canaries do.
-Of course, I'm gonna do that.

1007
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:34,482
They sing.

1008
00:45:34,521 --> 00:45:35,739
What do you think I'm a dope?

1009
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:37,482
L-Let's get off this topic.

1010
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,521
Hey, you were in my
dream last night.

1011
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:40,950
Yeah?

1012
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:44,263
What, I'm supposed to be
flattered you dream of me?

1013
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:46,857
I rescued you in the dream.

1014
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:50,185
Rescue me?

1015
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:52,724
What can I tell you?

1016
00:45:52,787 --> 00:45:54,708
I'm not gonna tell Ginny
my real feelings.

1017
00:45:54,763 --> 00:45:55,943
How could I?

1018
00:45:56,248 --> 00:45:58,428
But I was taken with Carolina.

1019
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:00,436
Something hit me right off.

1020
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:03,581
The more I talked with her,
the more I was intrigued by her.

1021
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:06,510
I felt a buzz all day
after our encounter.

1022
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,268
I'd like to see her
again but obviously

1023
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:11,581
I can't be honest with
Ginny about that.

1024
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:14,363
The last thing I wanna
do is hurt Ginny

1025
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,102
or wreck a good thing.

1026
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:18,837
Ginny's a very emotional woman.

1027
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:22,757
And how could I ever explain
things to Carolina?

1028
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:23,866
That's all I need.

1029
00:46:23,923 --> 00:46:25,751
Hey, I'm having an affair
with your stepmother

1030
00:46:25,776 --> 00:46:28,032
who's cheating with
me on your father?

1031
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:32,340
It's best to forget
about Carolina.

1032
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:33,366
A sweet dream.

1033
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:34,856
But a dream.

1034
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:37,618
But as in a Greek play,

1035
00:46:37,643 --> 00:46:40,708
Ananke or fate rules so
much of our destinies.

1036
00:46:40,794 --> 00:46:44,203
First, I accidentally drop my
book just missing her head.

1037
00:46:44,643 --> 00:46:46,113
And now look what happens.

1038
00:46:57,093 --> 00:46:58,152
Carolina!

1039
00:46:58,329 --> 00:46:58,869
Huh?

1040
00:46:58,947 --> 00:47:00,133
-Come on, get in!
-Oh!

1041
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:06,872
Thank you. God.
I was getting soaked!

1042
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:08,292
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

1043
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,004
I can't I'll be late for work.

1044
00:47:10,422 --> 00:47:12,397
I'll get you as close to
the boardwalk as I can.

1045
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:13,673
Okay.

1046
00:47:14,783 --> 00:47:18,469
♪ See the pyramids along the Nile ♪

1047
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:21,420
I knew what was going on, but

1048
00:47:21,581 --> 00:47:24,372
You look the other way when
your husband's hot stuff

1049
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:26,631
and six million women
are after him.

1050
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:27,989
But he wants you.

1051
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,102
And it's all jewelry and furs

1052
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,391
and Florida and the racetrack
and the Copa

1053
00:47:33,498 --> 00:47:35,572
and the roulette wheel and Cuba

1054
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:38,640
Wow, you've really lived a life.

1055
00:47:39,045 --> 00:47:40,233
It was great.

1056
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:42,076
Until it wasn't.

1057
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:44,623
And then it was a lot of arguing.

1058
00:47:44,855 --> 00:47:46,261
And getting pushed around.

1059
00:47:48,246 --> 00:47:50,683
What'd you uh,
what'd you argue over?

1060
00:47:51,808 --> 00:47:54,035
S-Sooner or later, everything.

1061
00:47:55,812 --> 00:47:59,125
It sounds exciting, but
it's an unreal way to live.

1062
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:03,757
I wanted family and-
and I wanted peace.

1063
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:07,039
So, eventually the whole
thing blew up and we split.

1064
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:11,785
But the FBI
got to me and I...

1065
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:15,576
I was all mixed up and scared
and I said things.

1066
00:48:16,218 --> 00:48:17,695
Because I know things.

1067
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,140
So they hate me and uh,
they're scared.

1068
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,258
I know where all the
bodies are buried.

1069
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:31,346
Jesus, what a sheltered
life I've led.

1070
00:48:31,983 --> 00:48:35,874
I have book knowledge but
you've really tasted life.

1071
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:38,530
You've been round the world.

1072
00:48:39,238 --> 00:48:41,027
Yeah, but you've been
around the block.

1073
00:48:42,058 --> 00:48:44,378
You think you'll always be
looking over your shoulder?

1074
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:48,062
Everybody dies, you can't walk
around thinking about it.

1075
00:48:49,328 --> 00:48:50,828
You're talking to a lifeguard.

1076
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:53,734
And hopefully with
time, things change.

1077
00:48:53,984 --> 00:48:55,851
I-I get paid to save people.

1078
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,407
You know, you'd be safe
in a place like Venice or

1079
00:48:58,744 --> 00:48:59,931
or Bora Bora.

1080
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:01,923
That's where I'm headed.

1081
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:05,447
I'm gonna be late.

1082
00:49:06,283 --> 00:49:08,314
I'm really flattered
you opened up to me.

1083
00:49:09,173 --> 00:49:10,541
You have a kind face.

1084
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,103
And you have a beautiful face.

1085
00:49:13,892 --> 00:49:15,439
Especially in this rain light.

1086
00:49:16,712 --> 00:49:17,837
Thank you for the lift.

1087
00:49:18,478 --> 00:49:19,947
I hope I didn't make you late.

1088
00:49:20,353 --> 00:49:21,830
No, it's okay.

1089
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,611
I'm glad I took you up
on the ride.

1090
00:49:24,572 --> 00:49:25,384
Bye.

1091
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:34,636
You're late!

1092
00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:36,332
I'm sorry, I got
caught in the storm.

1093
00:49:36,357 --> 00:49:38,738
I'll explain it all to you later,
I want your input.

1094
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:40,785
Well, I can't do all the
work here by myself.

1095
00:49:40,902 --> 00:49:43,558
I...I got-I got a migraine,
wouldn't you know it.

1096
00:49:43,636 --> 00:49:44,761
Well, it's the weather.

1097
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:46,839
Next time get here on time.

1098
00:49:47,472 --> 00:49:49,230
I don't wanna have to
cover for you.

1099
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:50,813
I'm usually very punctual.

1100
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,563
Usually doesn't do it,
this is a job.

1101
00:49:52,602 --> 00:49:54,204
I know you're not
used to schedules.

1102
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:55,961
Lucky Tiny's not here.

1103
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:58,057
Can I talk to you later?

1104
00:49:58,284 --> 00:50:00,525
When you're not so--
when you're feeling better?

1105
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:01,525
About what?

1106
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:03,376
Some advice when you're
not so stressed.

1107
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:05,644
If you would stop doing
that with your fingers

1108
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,643
it would-it would help.

1109
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:07,894
I get excited.

1110
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:10,620
My head's throbbing, I-I had
to do six tables alone.

1111
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:12,807
I broke my neck for-
for two fat ladies

1112
00:50:12,832 --> 00:50:14,315
and don't you know,
they stiffed me.

1113
00:50:14,363 --> 00:50:15,182
Hey!

1114
00:50:15,636 --> 00:50:17,511
I am very sorry I'm late.

1115
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:22,020
But I was s-shopping and when
I came out, it was raining.

1116
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:24,291
And you may have forgotten,
but today is a special day

1117
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:26,307
and I wanted to get it
gift-wrapped for you.

1118
00:50:26,408 --> 00:50:29,377
Oh, God...don't tell me
you got me a present.

1119
00:50:29,638 --> 00:50:32,130
How often do you turn 40?
It's a milestone!

1120
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:33,630
It's a tombstone.

1121
00:50:34,185 --> 00:50:35,771
You're not getting it till tonight.

1122
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:38,662
Can we order some clams?

1123
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:40,857
Uh, yeah.

1124
00:50:41,029 --> 00:50:41,912
-Hey.
-Yeah.

1125
00:50:43,154 --> 00:50:43,943
Hi.

1126
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:46,700
You can sit wherever you like.

1127
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:49,544
Cant' believe it's my birthday
and we can't be together.

1128
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:53,685
I know...I know Humpty's
got something planned.

1129
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:56,879
I don't need any present but

1130
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:59,770
I wouldn't mind dinner
someplace over candlelight.

1131
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:03,729
You've got a birthday
coming up too.

1132
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:05,766
I love the verbose Leos.

1133
00:51:05,806 --> 00:51:10,437
Leos are warm, generous,
protective... beautiful.

1134
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:14,448
God, I'm-I'm-I'm not beautiful
tonight, I got this

1135
00:51:15,315 --> 00:51:16,588
I got this migraine.

1136
00:51:16,683 --> 00:51:17,760
You guys like anything else?

1137
00:51:17,878 --> 00:51:19,011
I gotta go.

1138
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,561
I love you, Mickey.

1139
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:25,717
There you go. I said it.

1140
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:28,572
I'm coming.

1141
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,564
I gotta go.

1142
00:51:32,873 --> 00:51:35,693
And we wish you
a happy birthday!

1143
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:37,772
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday, Ginny!

1144
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:39,803
And don't be depressed
about turning 40.

1145
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:41,468
Hang on to it, because
take it from me,

1146
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:43,195
in a blink of an eye,
you'll be 50

1147
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,556
-and you're gonna wish you were 40.
-That's true.

1148
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:45,916
Come on, let me do it,
let me do it, let me do it.

1149
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,978
Come on, come on,
let me do it, let me do it.

1150
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,032
Come on you already
sung into it!

1151
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:49,923
A tape recorder.

1152
00:51:49,948 --> 00:51:51,003
-It's a tape recorder.
-Let him go.

1153
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:52,558
This is unbelievable machine.

1154
00:51:52,605 --> 00:51:55,941
Yeah, yeah, well, you know I thought
she'd like it for her birthday.

1155
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:58,826
I got a great buy on
that tape recorder.

1156
00:51:58,902 --> 00:52:01,300
-It's stolen!
-What do you mean, stolen?

1157
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:02,426
-Ah.
-What?

1158
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:06,626
Some bum stole it. He's tryin' to
sell it on the boardwalk, you know.

1159
00:52:06,882 --> 00:52:07,780
Big spender.

1160
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:10,295
Yeah, those guys will--
you know--pfff...

1161
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:13,272
They'll do anything to make
money to buy a drink.

1162
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,516
-So would I.
-Yeah.

1163
00:52:15,586 --> 00:52:17,656
I paid three bucks for it!

1164
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:18,851
-Three dollars?
-I mean I couldn't afford

1165
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:19,617
-a new one, right?
-That thing?

1166
00:52:19,642 --> 00:52:20,766
That's a deal!

1167
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:23,212
That's a lot of fun,
isn't it, Ginny?

1168
00:52:23,237 --> 00:52:24,275
Oh, sure.

1169
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,228
I wish I had one of these
things, it's great!

1170
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:28,730
What kind of birthday party
is this with no booze?

1171
00:52:28,832 --> 00:52:29,910
Shut up, Ryan.

1172
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:32,274
Hey, come on, it's a party.

1175
00:52:39,525 --> 00:52:41,578
If you're gonna sing, will you
at least get the words right?

1176
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:42,731
Those are the right words.

1177
00:52:42,756 --> 00:52:44,872
"She loved her sailor
and he loved her too".

1178
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:47,388
You know what? I think
it's time to go home.

1179
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:50,184
No, no, truly, come on.

1180
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:52,346
No, you know what, you should
come out on the boat on Saturday

1181
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:53,815
they're goin' for bluefish.

1182
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,620
Ah, she don't fish.

1183
00:52:55,645 --> 00:52:57,666
Well, neither do I, but
she can get a nice tan.

1184
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,130
She don't do nothin'.

1185
00:52:59,155 --> 00:53:01,099
Come on, don't go.

00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,374
She lights up when
you sing that.

00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,945
I love that.

1190
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:13,109
Come on, wait.

1191
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,171

Oh. Yeah, my...head's
cracking open

1196
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:39,643
I'm glad you like the scarf,
it looks great on you.

1197
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,898
Oh, thanks.

1198
00:53:41,757 --> 00:53:43,930
Jesus, are they ever going home?

1199
00:53:44,883 --> 00:53:46,821
Oh, my sixth aspirin.

1200
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,117
Hey, wha...what did you
wanna ask me about?

1201
00:53:50,156 --> 00:53:51,687
Oh, it can wait. I just
wanted to get your advice

1202
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:53,406
on something
concerning Mickey.

1203
00:53:55,153 --> 00:53:56,450
Mickey the lifeguard?

1204
00:53:56,614 --> 00:53:58,223
Uh-huh. But it can wait.

1205
00:53:58,965 --> 00:53:59,879
No, go ahead.

1206
00:54:00,379 --> 00:54:01,473
What about Mickey?

1207
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,348
I ran into him today in the rain

1208
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:05,754
and he gave me a lift.

1209
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:08,605
-He did?
-Yeah.

1210
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,700
Lucky me,
I would've been soaked.

1211
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:13,302
What, he just

1212
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:15,013
happen to drive by?

1213
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:16,076
Yeah.

1214
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:18,154
And we got a chance to talk.

1215
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:20,450
And I really think
there's something there.

1216
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:22,467
Like what?

1217
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,990
Well, he was

1218
00:54:24,138 --> 00:54:26,881
very charming and flirtatious.

1219
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:29,116
And he liked hearing
all about me.

1220
00:54:29,288 --> 00:54:31,608
I must say, I found
him very appealing.

1221
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,927
Hey!

1222
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:35,303
W-What are yous doin'?

1223
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,349
Why don't you come join us?

1224
00:54:37,418 --> 00:54:39,941
Y-You could sing. You know
"April Showers", right?

1225
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,223
We're just talking, Dad.

1226
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,215
Oh.

1227
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:44,751
Oh, baby,

1228
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,501
I didn't get a chance to
give you your birthday kiss.

1229
00:54:49,368 --> 00:54:50,509
You know,

1230
00:54:50,674 --> 00:54:54,969
you're just as pretty today as you
were when I first started dating you.

1231
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,431
I'm a lucky guy.

1232
00:54:58,666 --> 00:54:59,783
Come on, join us.

1233
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:01,369
We will.

1234
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,658
W-What makes you think he
liked hearing your story?

1235
00:55:04,683 --> 00:55:05,814
Did he say anything?

1236
00:55:05,978 --> 00:55:07,712
He was clearly flirty.

1237
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:10,170
-Yeah? It was obvious?
-Mm-hmm.

1238
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,592
And we were sitting in
the car in the rain and...

1239
00:55:14,384 --> 00:55:16,743
It was like being in one
of those love pictures.

1240
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:19,533
Well, how far did it go? Did
he take your hand or anything?

1241
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:21,307
No, we just talked.

1242
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:24,455
Then I told him about
Frank and my marriage.

1243
00:55:24,573 --> 00:55:26,455
And he found the whole
story dramatic.

1244
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,747
You opened up to a
guy you just met?

1245
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:31,489
I know, I...

1246
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,512
I found myself talking and talking.

1247
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,801
Oh, it's funny, I...

1248
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,434
I felt very at ease with him.

1249
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:41,106
Even when I first met him.

1250
00:55:41,181 --> 00:55:43,211
Well, did he become familiar?
I mean, d-did he try anything?

1251
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:44,423
Did he take your hand?

1252
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,954
He said I had a beautiful
face in the rain light.

1253
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:51,164
Isn't that a nice phrase,
"the rain light"?

1254
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:52,977
He's a poet.

1255
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,539
Uh-huh. And did he
take your hand?

1256
00:55:56,704 --> 00:55:58,618
Christ, did he do anything?
Did he touch you?

1257
00:55:58,643 --> 00:55:59,954
Did-did-did-
did he kiss you?

1258
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,578
Why are you getting so heated?

1259
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:03,891
Well, it's
like pulling teeth!

1260
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:07,207
God, between you and them and
m-my headache!

1261
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:09,230
Well, I told you that
this could wait.

1262
00:56:09,277 --> 00:56:10,480
Just continue.

1263
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,972
He didn't touch me.

1264
00:56:13,868 --> 00:56:16,892
I'm telling you because I probably
over-interpreted it because I-I--

1265
00:56:16,954 --> 00:56:18,361
I wanted him to.

1266
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,783
But that's why I'm asking you
because you know the guy.

1267
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:23,775
So-So what's he like?

1268
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:25,761
He's a loose talker.

1269
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,269
My advice is to watch yourself.

1270
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:30,944
Yeah, he fills your
head full of lies

1271
00:56:30,977 --> 00:56:33,867
but--and his reputation
is that he's a phony.

1272
00:56:34,008 --> 00:56:34,960
Really?

1273
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:37,533
Well, he-he didn't do anything?

1274
00:56:37,596 --> 00:56:38,658
I mean, he didn't kiss you?

1275
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:39,963
Unless you're not telling me.

1276
00:56:40,072 --> 00:56:41,494
Why wouldn't I tell you?

1277
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,080
Then I say forget him.

1278
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:46,568
I happen to know he's got a
girlfriend who he's in love with.

1279
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:48,865
And maybe even plans to marry.

1280
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:52,163
So my-my advice
is-is to keep away.

1281
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,460
That's disappointing.

1282
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,584
Well, honey, he'll-he'll
break your heart.

1283
00:56:57,685 --> 00:56:59,240
You know, is that what you want?

1284
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:01,536
Are you sure?

1285
00:57:02,036 --> 00:57:04,184
Men can't be trusted.

1286
00:57:05,427 --> 00:57:08,208
I should talk. My husband
trusted me and I...

1287
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:10,270
I hurt him. I wrecked him.

1288
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:13,799
I'm not sure he didn't kill
himself in some hotel room in

1289
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:15,283
in Philadelphia.

1290
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:16,708
I-I don't-I don't
wanna know about it.

1291
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:19,012
He decides to take 90
sleeping pills, or 85

1292
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:22,442
I'm supposed to...
supposed to blame myself?

1293
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:24,857
Christ, can they
get the hell out?!

1294
00:57:25,778 --> 00:57:27,653
Calm down, Ginny,
they're leaving.

1295
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:28,879
I know him.

1296
00:57:29,293 --> 00:57:30,489
And I know him

1297
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:33,379
well enough to know
you're not his type.

1298
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:36,104
And he--honey, he's taken.

1299
00:57:36,634 --> 00:57:37,891
He's not free.

1300
00:57:39,674 --> 00:57:40,588
Okay.

1301
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:43,215
That's why I asked you.

1302
00:57:43,636 --> 00:57:45,245
Come here, Richie,
come say goodbye.

1303
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:46,401
Come on, come here.

1304
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:48,089
-See you later, kiddo.
-Bye.

1305
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:49,917
Bye, sweetheart.

1306
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:51,893
Ginny!

1307
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,315
-Ginny!
-Bye.

1308
00:57:53,549 --> 00:57:54,573
Happy birthday!

1309
00:57:54,902 --> 00:57:56,707
Make sure you're coming
to the boat this weekend.

1310
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,488
I didn't mean to
bother you with this.

1311
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:01,198
Why don't you lie down?

1312
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:03,816
You know, just because
you're a pretty young girl

1313
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:06,387
who's been pampered
and chased after,

1314
00:58:06,465 --> 00:58:09,051
you think every man
is a pushover!

1315
00:58:09,231 --> 00:58:11,918
Why are you saying that?
What did I do?

1316
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:13,351
Well, it's true, isn't it?

1317
00:58:13,422 --> 00:58:17,093
Car and drivers, you know,
winters in Palm Beach...

1318
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:18,873
God, who you kidding?

1319
00:58:20,859 --> 00:58:21,687
Hello?

1320
00:58:22,547 --> 00:58:23,414
What?

1321
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,132
This is his mother.

1322
00:58:30,445 --> 00:58:31,226
Where?

1323
00:58:31,734 --> 00:58:33,078
When, t-today?

1324
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:35,750
Was anybody hurt?

1325
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:38,054
But nobody got
burned or anything?

1326
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:40,890
Well, no, no.

1327
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:44,023
No, I-I work then.

1328
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:46,702
Well, no, no, no, no--

1329
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:49,539
No, no, there's no-no
reason to involve the police.

1330
00:58:49,938 --> 00:58:50,664
Yeah.

1331
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,391
Yes.

1332
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,141
I'll be there.

1333
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,367
Nine-thirty.

1334
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:56,156
Uh-huh.

1335
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:57,063
Thank you.

1336
00:58:57,489 --> 00:58:59,255
<i>♪ Bell bottom trousers-- ♪</i>

1337
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:01,880
Put away that goddamn machine!

1338
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:03,106
What'd I do?

1339
00:59:03,202 --> 00:59:04,687
You know what you did!

1340
00:59:04,993 --> 00:59:06,313
You made a fire

1341
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:08,540
in the basement of
an apartment house!

1342
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,009
What the hell were you doing

1343
00:59:10,071 --> 00:59:12,087
in a basement of an
apartment house?

1344
00:59:12,743 --> 00:59:14,478
Listen to me!

1345
00:59:15,337 --> 00:59:17,087
They were gonna call the police.

1346
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:18,664
We have to see the
principal tomorrow.

1347
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:20,360
What is wrong with you?

1348
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,282
Huh? Do you wanna-
you wanna kill somebody?

1349
00:59:23,484 --> 00:59:25,531
Do you wanna burn
yourself to death?

1350
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:28,232
Oh, Jesus, I can't take
this close living.

1351
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:29,638
Everything's coming apart.

1352
00:59:29,755 --> 00:59:30,974
W-What's wrong?

1353
00:59:31,036 --> 00:59:32,076
What's wrong?

1354
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:35,887
Is one of these days, he's
gonna kill someone with a fire!

1355
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,215
You did it again?

1356
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:40,663
Oh, God, where'd you get this
sick habit to make fires?

1357
00:59:40,819 --> 00:59:41,968
Are you demented?

1358
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,316
You know what? I swear I catch
you with matches again,

1359
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,948
I'm gonna beat your brains out
and that goes for your stealin' too.

1360
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:48,801
Okay, we're too crowded here.

1361
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,241
And she's no help.

1362
00:59:50,405 --> 00:59:51,733
You know, you spoiled her.

1363
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:53,507
Her husband pampered her.

1364
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:55,233
She's no good in the restaurant.

1365
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:57,467
Let her go to Mexico
where she's safe.

1366
00:59:57,623 --> 00:59:59,748
Well, she's right.
I'll get out.

1367
00:59:59,904 --> 01:00:01,318
No, you won't.

1368
01:00:01,716 --> 01:00:03,232
Where the hell you gonna go?

1369
01:00:03,646 --> 01:00:05,584
Business is off all over.

1370
01:00:05,826 --> 01:00:07,224
Come on, we're broke.

1371
01:00:07,802 --> 01:00:10,419
No, no, you're finally
going to school.

1372
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,972
You stay here until you get
your feet on the ground

1373
01:00:13,051 --> 01:00:14,145
and then you can go.

1374
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,691
She's not happy
waiting on tables

1375
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:18,457
and she's no good at it.

1376
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:20,450
All right.

1377
01:00:21,006 --> 01:00:22,912
Let's do somethin' about the kid.

1378
01:00:23,217 --> 01:00:24,514
You know what
I'm gonna do?

1379
01:00:24,717 --> 01:00:26,047
I'm gonna take my strap off

1380
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:28,383
and I'm gonna teach you a lesson
you're never gonna forget.

1381
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:29,529
Hey, don't you dare.

1382
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:32,166
He started the fire. How did
this get to be about me?

1383
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:34,032
W-Why can't she find
a job somewhere else?

1384
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,485
Get a room and then split
the rent with some girl.

1385
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,380
What are you--come on, she's--

1386
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:39,887
She's tryin' to go to school,

1387
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:41,513
she's tryin' to make
a life, all right?

1388
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:44,098
Sh-She wants to
amount to somethin'.

1389
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:47,123
She's not gonna spend the rest
of her life waiting tables.

1390
01:00:47,255 --> 01:00:48,662
She's better than that.

1391
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,584
It's 'cause
you're too close to her.

1392
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:52,247
Honey,

1393
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:54,903
there's class in this girl.

1394
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:57,200
She made a mistake, all right?

1395
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:59,286
And I swore I'd never
forgive her, but

1396
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:02,282
it's not in my nature
to stay angry, honey.

1397
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:04,743
And what about me, huh?

1398
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:06,807
I don't wanna be
a waitress either.

1399
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:09,018
There's more to me
than shucking oysters.

1400
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:11,360
You're upset, baby. All right?

1401
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:14,914
Every birthday instead of
celebrating, you put on a long face.

1402
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,258
Come on, honey.

1403
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:18,688
What I really need
is a drink.

1404
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:21,790
But I can't have it
'cause you'll fall off the wagon.

1405
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:23,457
Argh, go to bed!

1406
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:25,340
-Go to bed!
-Hey!

1407
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:30,710
What the hell?!

1408
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:36,646
All right, here we go.

1409
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:42,002
Hi. The same time next
Thursday okay for you?

1410
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,604
I work. I'll have to call you.

1411
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:47,252
-He may have to come alone.
-Oh, that's fine.

1412
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:48,651
-Okay.
-Okay.

1413
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,026
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1414
01:01:51,995 --> 01:01:54,792
-How'd you like her?
-She was okay.

1415
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,175
Well, what'd she say?

1416
01:01:57,057 --> 01:01:58,002
Nothing.

1417
01:01:58,162 --> 01:01:59,794
Well, I'm sure she
didn't say nothing.

1418
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,232
She asked a few questions.

1419
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:02,146
Like what?

1420
01:02:02,529 --> 01:02:03,505
I don't know.

1421
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:04,576
Tell me.

1422
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:06,528
I don't remember.

1423
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,184
About my father, and you,
and Humpty.

1424
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,614
And then what'd you say?

1425
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,957
I don't remember.

1426
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,045
Did you tell her I love you?

1427
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:19,709
Did you tell her I screwed up your
life by betraying your father?

1428
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:21,767
Huh? What'd she say to that?

1429
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:24,906
She must have a pretty
low opinion of me.

1430
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:27,836
I told her that it's your
fault my real father's gone.

1431
01:02:28,301 --> 01:02:29,684
Where'd you get that from?

1432
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:33,309
You just said it,
you say it all the time!

1433
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:37,004
I told her it makes you cry
and you think you hear drums.

1434
01:02:39,475 --> 01:02:42,225
Hey, Humpty, Humpty,

1435
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,601
He-He has to see this doctor.

1436
01:02:44,876 --> 01:02:46,727
He has to see this
doctor once a week.

1437
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:48,790
We need an extra
ten dollars a week.

1438
01:02:48,985 --> 01:02:51,141
Don't look at me,
you see how business is.

1439
01:02:51,211 --> 01:02:52,688
Well, don't look at me either.

1440
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:55,406
-You have some money saved.
-What money?

1441
01:02:55,664 --> 01:02:56,765
Plenty of money.

1442
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:58,226
From when you hit
your number and since

1443
01:02:58,272 --> 01:02:59,858
Carolina came, you put
away a few dollars

1444
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:01,367
from your paycheck
every week.

1445
01:03:01,437 --> 01:03:04,062
And you have some-some
money left from selling the car.

1446
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,419
Uh, listen, Th-that's for
her school, okay?

1447
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:08,888
She earns money.

1448
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:11,378
What, Ruby's?
She makes peanuts, come on.

1449
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,323
Well, you-you got plenty
in that tin box.

1450
01:03:13,348 --> 01:03:15,214
And I-I need to pay
the psychiatrist.

1451
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,831
I don't believe in
any of that crap.

1452
01:03:18,021 --> 01:03:19,622
You know, you just gotta
be stricter with him.

1453
01:03:19,653 --> 01:03:22,106
I-I've said it a dozen times.

1454
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:25,583
I-I need some
extra money, okay?

1455
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,364
He-He needs help.

1456
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:31,653
Well...for what?
What-what about my daughter?

1457
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,532
All right? I'm not gonna
throw away her future

1458
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:36,290
to pay for some
phony head doctor.

1459
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:39,078
That's the biggest
goddamn racket.

1460
01:03:39,234 --> 01:03:40,172
Right this way, folks.

1461
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:41,804
What's with the cigarettes?

1462
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,627
I'm smoking. I'm smoking.

1463
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:47,627
Ginny, come on.

1464
01:03:48,518 --> 01:03:51,727
Coney's on the skids. We
don't raise enough to live.

1465
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:54,041
Honey, honey, I don't
blame you for--

1466
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,791
for being moody,
I know you're moody.

1467
01:03:58,121 --> 01:03:59,621
Okay, I...

1468
01:04:00,347 --> 01:04:02,535
You know, I... I don't get it.

1469
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:05,542
Y-Y-You're happy one minute

1470
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:07,542
and then you get crazy.

1471
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:11,495
You pick fights with Carolina
for no good goddamn reason.

1472
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,167
She likes you.

1473
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:14,980
Look at me, she likes you.

1474
01:04:17,902 --> 01:04:18,933
Come on.

1475
01:04:19,729 --> 01:04:21,417
What happened to us, huh?

1476
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,666
We should talk
to each other more.

1477
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:24,236
Ugh.

1478
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:26,244
We should go fishing together.

1479
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,490
Your problem is you're
wrapped up in Carolina.

1480
01:04:28,515 --> 01:04:29,624
I told you that.

1481
01:04:29,656 --> 01:04:31,609
You scrimp and save for her,
you take her fishing with you,

1482
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,187
you get angry if she
goes on a date.

1483
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:36,350
And face it, Humpty,
you treat her like a girlfriend.

1484
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:38,616
You're gonna be crushed
when she dumps you again.

1485
01:04:38,695 --> 01:04:41,514
And she will dump you
and move on.

1486
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:42,820
You know what?

1487
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:46,681
I cannot have this
conversation anymore.

1488
01:04:48,588 --> 01:04:50,354
You've got a one-track mind.

1489
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,018
And you've become insulting!

1490
01:05:01,194 --> 01:05:03,108
You remembered I loved it here.

1491
01:05:03,655 --> 01:05:05,413
Here. Here's your present.

1492
01:05:05,827 --> 01:05:07,241
Happy birthday.

1493
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:09,819
It's obviously a book.

1494
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:11,319
Open it.

1495
01:05:13,616 --> 01:05:15,459
The plays of Eugene O'Neill.

1496
01:05:15,585 --> 01:05:17,452
You'll like them. They're dark.

1497
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:19,210
And he really knew the score.

1498
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:21,373
You know? Human nature
and existence.

1499
01:05:21,428 --> 01:05:23,522
I once acted in a play of his.

1500
01:05:23,573 --> 01:05:24,861
Which? I know them all.

1501
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:27,713
It was just summer stock, they
did uh, <i>The Iceman Cometh</i>.

1502
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,020
I-I played one of the whores.

1503
01:05:29,082 --> 01:05:30,199
What power!

1504
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:32,567
To write a play about
the human condition.

1505
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:34,931
The tragic human condition and

1506
01:05:34,986 --> 01:05:37,743
how we have to lie to
ourselves in order to live.

1507
01:05:38,931 --> 01:05:41,345
Anyhow, happy 40th.

1508
01:05:48,313 --> 01:05:50,423
Carolina says you were
flirting with her.

1509
01:05:51,274 --> 01:05:52,407
Flirting?

1510
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:54,610
I gave her a lift in the rain.

1511
01:05:55,629 --> 01:05:56,684
You don't have to lie.

1512
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,590
She said you parked
and had a long talk.

1513
01:05:59,817 --> 01:06:01,004
A flirtatious talk.

1514
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,688
Did she get the impression
that I was flirting?

1515
01:06:03,985 --> 01:06:07,399
Jesus. I mean, I was
fascinated by her story.

1516
01:06:07,652 --> 01:06:10,347
This girl's lived a lifetime
in her 26 years.

1517
01:06:10,738 --> 01:06:11,988
Did you make a pass at her?

1518
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,630
A pass? God, no.
I gave her a lift.

1519
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:18,841
Did you tell her she had a
beautiful face in the rain light?

1520
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:23,299
I don't remember.
I-I-I may have, but

1521
01:06:23,853 --> 01:06:25,424
what's wrong with a compliment?

1522
01:06:25,971 --> 01:06:27,627
You know she's a marked woman.

1523
01:06:27,899 --> 01:06:31,367
I-I do, she told me her story.
It's chilling.

1524
01:06:31,985 --> 01:06:33,774
Would you like to spend
more time with her?

1525
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:36,231
Why do you say that?

1526
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:38,114
Well, that's the
impression she got.

1527
01:06:38,215 --> 01:06:41,129
Look, this is supposed to be
your birthday celebration

1528
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:43,580
and it's turning into
the third degree.

1529
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:45,486
Can't you see I'm jealous?

1530
01:06:46,244 --> 01:06:48,596
Nothing's happened
to be jealous of.

1531
01:06:48,682 --> 01:06:51,798
I was hoping...
we might have a future together.

1532
01:06:52,777 --> 01:06:54,395
Yes, I know, I...

1533
01:06:54,505 --> 01:06:57,317
I told you we'd talk about
it when the time comes.

1534
01:06:57,585 --> 01:06:59,233
If you told her she
had a beautiful face,

1535
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,234
what the hell is-is she
supposed to think?

1536
01:07:01,304 --> 01:07:02,796
What the hell am I
supposed to think?

1537
01:07:02,846 --> 01:07:05,925
Hey, we were sitting in
the car on a rainy day--

1538
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:08,330
that light would've
looked soft on any woman.

1539
01:07:08,355 --> 01:07:11,487
You know what, this conversation
is-is starting to take a crazy turn.

1540
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:13,985
I've become consumed
with jealousy!

1541
01:07:15,794 --> 01:07:17,388
Can we start the day over?

1542
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,779
I really hope you like
your birthday present.

1543
01:07:21,169 --> 01:07:22,739
O'Neill was a great one.

1544
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,435
Great and terrifying.

1545
01:07:27,692 --> 01:07:29,982
Of course I felt terrible.

1546
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:31,730
I needed to talk
the situation over

1547
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,278
with someone a lot
sharper than me.

1548
01:07:34,544 --> 01:07:36,661
I called my friend Jake Jacoby

1549
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:38,883
who's a graduate
student at city college

1550
01:07:38,908 --> 01:07:40,595
in the philosophy department.

1551
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:42,627
It doesn't make sense because

1552
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:46,316
you're not dealing with sense,
you're dealing with feelings.

1553
01:07:47,057 --> 01:07:48,705
Feelings, my friend.

1554
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,416
It's a whole different ballgame.

1555
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:54,018
The whole thing
is so irrational.

1556
01:07:54,143 --> 01:07:56,682
I've been seeing this
married woman all summer.

1557
01:07:56,846 --> 01:07:58,768
And she has these fantasies of

1558
01:07:58,899 --> 01:08:01,384
leaving her husband
and going away with me.

1559
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:04,977
Her fondest wish would be
to divorce him and marry me.

1560
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,540
And at times I see it

1561
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:10,142
and at times I don't.

1562
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:14,265
She's older than me
and I like that.

1563
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,570
Somehow it fits into
the romantic narrative of

1564
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:19,124
the writer's life.

1565
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:23,809
But she's more than that.

1566
01:08:24,137 --> 01:08:26,989
So-So-So why am I hesitant?

1567
01:08:27,133 --> 01:08:28,265
One minute I'm not sure,

1568
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:30,235
the next I'm ready to
take charge of her life--

1569
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:31,696
to rescue her.

1570
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:34,825
Can-Can this Carolina
be relied on?

1571
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,583
After all, she-she did
run away with gangsters

1572
01:08:37,794 --> 01:08:39,598
because she was a thrillseeker.

1573
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:41,935
Uh... you know...

1574
01:08:42,045 --> 01:08:44,146
did-did-did she learn her lesson?

1575
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:47,935
She may give you
a period of bliss

1576
01:08:48,106 --> 01:08:49,770
but will it sustain?

1577
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:52,566
Will this other one be

1578
01:08:52,823 --> 01:08:54,934
a more solid fit for you?

1579
01:08:55,495 --> 01:08:58,558
When I hear you say it,
I think,

1580
01:08:58,823 --> 01:09:00,417
yes, she would.

1581
01:09:01,507 --> 01:09:04,664
And-And Ginny's counting
on me, she's drowning.

1582
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:08,131
Yeah, she'd be eternally
grateful for a lifeline.

1583
01:09:09,128 --> 01:09:13,612
Af-After all, you know, a love
so intense as hers is for you

1584
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:16,472
is a rare gift to have
bestowed on a man.

1585
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,017
It's amazing how
lucid things become

1586
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,118
when you get an
outside perspective.

1587
01:09:26,653 --> 01:09:30,786
At that moment, a fog lifted
and my choice was obvious.

1588
01:09:31,065 --> 01:09:32,987
Carolina was a lovely daydream

1589
01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:36,589
but reality, with all its pros
and cons, belonged to Ginny.

1590
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:40,234
All my silly schemes to
pursue Carolina seemed crazy

1591
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,805
and I made the decision to never
entertain that pipe dream again.

1592
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:48,570
But as Jake said, the heart
has its own hieroglyphics.

1593
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:50,649
Maybe he was right.

1594
01:09:51,352 --> 01:09:52,399
Hi!

1595
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:54,932
I came to tell you something.

1596
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:56,763
Oh, yeah?

1597
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,254
I thought of you yesterday.

1598
01:09:58,324 --> 01:10:00,051
I know you mentioned
that you love pizza.

1599
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:02,261
And somebody said he knew the
greatest pizza place in Brooklyn.

1600
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:04,051
And he took me there
and he was right.

1601
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:05,621
And I thought you'd
wanna know about it.

1602
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,349
Your boyfriend took you?

1603
01:10:07,607 --> 01:10:09,888
It's called Capri, it's a few
blocks from the boardwalk

1604
01:10:09,913 --> 01:10:11,099
not far from here.

1605
01:10:11,334 --> 01:10:12,685
Will you let me take you there?

1606
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,128
I'm kinda busy
with school all week.

1607
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:17,995
Is Friday night good?

1608
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:21,909
Friday, I can do.

1609
01:10:22,838 --> 01:10:24,120

-Yes, I do.

1617
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:54,881

I'm glad we could steal
these few minutes.

1635
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:06,574
No one will see us this end
of the boardwalk, it's

1636
01:12:06,746 --> 01:12:08,176
it's so private.

1637
01:12:08,981 --> 01:12:10,285
I wanted to talk to you.

1638
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:13,039
But first, I want to talk to you.

1639
01:12:14,032 --> 01:12:14,782
Okay.

1640
01:12:15,305 --> 01:12:16,914
Don't look so worried.

1641
01:12:17,141 --> 01:12:18,774
Mine is a nice thing.

1642
01:12:19,852 --> 01:12:20,641
What?

1643
01:12:24,001 --> 01:12:25,102
Did you miss me?

1644
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:28,274
Well, you've been so
busy with your son--

1645
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:30,000
That's not what I asked you.

1646
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,704
-Did you miss me?
-Jesus, Ginny.

1647
01:12:31,758 --> 01:12:33,219
-Why are you always so evasive?
-Take it easy.

1648
01:12:33,313 --> 01:12:35,696
You never wanna talk
about anything.

1649
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:39,970
Okay, look, I don't want
to get off to a bad start.

1650
01:12:41,563 --> 01:12:43,750
Remember last week
it was my birthday?

1651
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,821
-Yes.
-Well, today is yours.

1652
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:48,836
How'd you know?

1653
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:50,836
You mentioned it.

1654
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:53,550
Remember we're both Leos?

1655
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,159
I mentioned it ages ago.
What a memory.

1656
01:12:58,541 --> 01:12:59,564
What is that?

1657
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,245
I got you a present.

1658
01:13:01,432 --> 01:13:03,346
-No.
-Here.

1659
01:13:13,304 --> 01:13:14,530
Oh, God.

1660
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,257
You-You...
You can't do that.

1661
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:20,420
-Why not?
-I-It's not right.

1662
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:22,172
You got me a gift.

1663
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:25,242
I know, but...
what the hell, I got you a book.

1664
01:13:25,384 --> 01:13:28,173
This is... i-i-it's-
it's much too expensive.

1665
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:29,352
I can't accept this.

1666
01:13:29,398 --> 01:13:30,649
How would you know
it's so expensive?

1667
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:32,274
I've inquired about this watch.

1668
01:13:32,299 --> 01:13:34,133
-I was with you.
-Ginny.

1669
01:13:34,508 --> 01:13:37,929
Okay. This is a $500 watch.

1670
01:13:38,266 --> 01:13:39,789
But you always
wanted this watch.

1671
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:41,859
Yes, but it's much
too extravagant.

1672
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,890
-You can't afford this.
-That's my business.

1673
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:46,684
And even if you could, it's
much too extravagant, given...

1674
01:13:46,754 --> 01:13:48,231
Given what?
Given-Given what?

1675
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:49,723
It's too much to spend on me.

1676
01:13:49,785 --> 01:13:51,590
You shouldn't be
getting me jewelry.

1677
01:13:52,192 --> 01:13:54,715
Why not?
Is it too meaningful?

1678
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,700
Oh, Christ. You inscribed it.

1679
01:13:57,926 --> 01:13:58,981
Yeah, read it.

1680
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:02,770
Look...

1681
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:06,139
We have to have a talk.

1682
01:14:06,662 --> 01:14:08,311
I thought you'd be excited.

1683
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:10,790
It's too much and I can't
accept this watch.

1684
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,096
Stop saying that!

1685
01:14:12,121 --> 01:14:14,026
You can't be buying
me a $500 watch.

1686
01:14:14,202 --> 01:14:15,874
Look, why?

1687
01:14:16,022 --> 01:14:18,491
Y-You're always saying
what a beautiful, perfect

1688
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:20,600
summer it's been, and-and...

1689
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:24,181
It's not right given
the circumstances.

1690
01:14:24,322 --> 01:14:25,572
What circumstances?

1691
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:26,697
What are the goddamn
circumstances?

1692
01:14:26,722 --> 01:14:29,026
That you're ready
to get very serious

1693
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:30,992
and I'm just not ready.

1694
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:32,617
Something's happened.

1695
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,156
Something's happened,
everything was--

1696
01:14:34,218 --> 01:14:36,538
Everything was going so smoothly.
Something's gone wrong.

1697
01:14:36,571 --> 01:14:38,406
I don't wanna disappoint you.

1698
01:14:38,906 --> 01:14:41,054
Look, you-you said you love me.

1699
01:14:41,364 --> 01:14:42,903
Were you insincere?

1700
01:14:44,598 --> 01:14:46,965
It's not that I wasn't trying.

1701
01:14:47,418 --> 01:14:49,824
Of course if you have to try.
It's-It's not homework.

1702
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:53,230
I'm not saying I don't have
real feelings for you.

1703
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:55,656
Is it Carolina?

1704
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:59,555
Jesus Christ, I hardly
know Carolina.

1705
01:14:59,637 --> 01:15:01,051
But you wanna get to know her.

1706
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:03,074
And I should wait around
while you could try her out?

1707
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,388
Hey, I didn't say that.

1708
01:15:04,638 --> 01:15:06,208
I didn't say that.
You're losing it.

1709
01:15:06,393 --> 01:15:08,369
You know what?
You don't want it?

1710
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:11,510
Forget it. Huh?
Forget it!

1711
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:12,494
-What the hell are you doing?
-Forget it!

1712
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,565
Ginny!

1713
01:15:13,744 --> 01:15:16,080
-Are you crazy?
-Don't talk to me!

1714
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:20,876
All right, you little punk, give me
back that money or I'll kill ya.

1715
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:22,557
Hey, w-what's going on?

1716
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:23,280
I didn't take his money!

1717
01:15:23,305 --> 01:15:25,702
Don't tell me, you little thief,
you're always stealing from me.

1718
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:27,911
He took 400 bucks
out of my tin box.

1719
01:15:27,936 --> 01:15:29,341
I did not!

1720
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:32,017
You know what? That's 400 bucks.
That's grand larceny.

1721
01:15:32,124 --> 01:15:33,858
You know, I ougta
bang it outta ya.

1722
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,038
He didn't take it.

1723
01:15:35,132 --> 01:15:37,514
Don't-Don't be tellin'
me he didn't take it.

1724
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,108
You know, you're always
stickin' up for him.

1725
01:15:39,177 --> 01:15:40,888
That's why he is
the way he is.

1726
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:43,030
-Now you give me that money back.
-I took it.

1727
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,405
Don't make up a story.

1728
01:15:44,436 --> 01:15:46,436
I took the money, not him.

1729
01:15:48,309 --> 01:15:49,340
You took it?

1730
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:53,473
Yeah, I-I-I needed it to
pay for a psychiatrist for him.

1731
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:54,574
What?!

1732
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,847
That's right, they're-they're
a lot of money and

1733
01:15:56,895 --> 01:15:58,957
and he's been goin'
every few days. I...

1734
01:15:59,073 --> 01:16:00,808
I-I-I didn't wanna tell you.

1735
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:05,440
Wait, y-y-you took my savings
to pay for a head doctor?

1736
01:16:05,502 --> 01:16:07,276
He needs help.

1737
01:16:07,307 --> 01:16:10,377
Yeah, you know what? I was saving
that money for Carolina's school.

1738
01:16:10,402 --> 01:16:13,217
Well, she'll just have to put
some of her dreams on hold.

1739
01:16:13,293 --> 01:16:14,699
I got a call
from his doctor

1740
01:16:14,724 --> 01:16:16,777
that he started a fire
in her waiting room.

1741
01:16:16,983 --> 01:16:19,014
Richie! Is that so?

1742
01:16:19,145 --> 01:16:20,731
I don't wanna go back there.

1743
01:16:20,783 --> 01:16:23,674
You know what? You steal. What
kind of example is that? Jesus.

1744
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:25,622
Oh, God, I can't
handle this now.

1745
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,364
Look, I-I-I'm late for work.

1746
01:16:27,473 --> 01:16:31,098
I am sick of waiting on tables
and kicking in my salary so that

1747
01:16:31,184 --> 01:16:34,012
you can put away your
extra money for Carolina.

1748
01:16:34,074 --> 01:16:37,058
Oh, God! Now my
head is pounding.

1749
01:16:37,183 --> 01:16:38,737
Well, take an aspirin.

1750
01:16:38,816 --> 01:16:40,590
I don't want an aspirin.

1751
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,182
I want a Scotch!

1752
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:44,215
Take an aspirin!

1753
01:16:46,152 --> 01:16:47,996
Jeez, so that's where
you've been hidin' it.

1754
01:16:48,183 --> 01:16:49,543
I knew you had a stash.

1755
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:52,048
And when I begged you for
a shot, when I needed it

1756
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:53,571
you wouldn't give me,
but when you need one, you--

1757
01:16:53,611 --> 01:16:54,602
You're not allowed.

1758
01:16:54,627 --> 01:16:55,673
I knew you had a bottle.

1759
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:56,751
-I knew it.
-Hi!

1760
01:16:56,776 --> 01:16:58,876
I'm late, I'm such a scatterbrain.

1761
01:16:58,935 --> 01:17:01,029
I have a date
and I forgot my wallet.

1762
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:03,433
Uh, I'm meeting Mickey
and I found

1763
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,159
this great pizza place.

1764
01:17:05,242 --> 01:17:06,875
It's his birthday,
so I'm treating.

1765
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,851
What, y-y-you're
going with Mickey?

1766
01:17:09,312 --> 01:17:11,859
Don't look so stunned, you
introduced me to him, remember?

1767
01:17:12,109 --> 01:17:14,077
If he breaks my heart,
you're to blame.

1768
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:16,280
I know you warned me but

1769
01:17:16,413 --> 01:17:18,929
I think he likes me
and is sincere.

1770
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,117
Not that anything's
happened yet but

1771
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:22,776
I'm hoping tonight's the night.

1772
01:17:22,855 --> 01:17:23,566
Yes!

1773
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,781
I've gotta go.

1774
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,313
Bye.

1775
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,063
Don't come home late.

1776
01:17:30,356 --> 01:17:31,841
What are you doin'?

1777
01:17:32,497 --> 01:17:33,856
I'm drinking!

1778
01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:36,083

Uh, the, those two guys
that were just here...?

1793
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:43,332
Yeah, they were
lookin' for Carolina.

1794
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,712
-How'd they know she worked here?
-I don't know.

1795
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,966
Well, what'd you tell 'em?
Nothing, I hope.

1796
01:18:48,005 --> 01:18:49,107
They said they
needed to find her

1797
01:18:49,163 --> 01:18:50,568
and I know she's havin'
dinner with some guy tonight

1798
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:53,326
at the uh, Capri Pizzeria
up on Beach Walk.

1799
01:18:53,534 --> 01:18:55,058
God, I hope you didn't say that.

1800
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:56,143
Yeah, I did, why?

1801
01:18:56,245 --> 01:18:57,299
Did I do wrong?
Something wrong?

1802
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:58,002
God, I...

1803
01:18:58,412 --> 01:19:00,530
I have to make a phone call
before they get there.

1804
01:19:00,756 --> 01:19:02,561
-Capri, the Italian restaurant?
-Uh phone's not--

1805
01:19:02,616 --> 01:19:04,615
Yeah, yeah. It's not
workin' though, the phone.

1806
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:05,678
What do you mean
the phone's not--?

1807
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,905
-not working?
-I don't know, all day long.

1808
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,725
Jesus, I've to
make a phone call!

1809
01:19:08,756 --> 01:19:10,287
-You need a nickel?
-I have to make a phone call.

1810
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,503
I h-h-have to make
and emergency call.

1811
01:19:17,141 --> 01:19:18,110
All right, Miss.

1812
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:19,625
I gotta call you back.

1813
01:19:19,657 --> 01:19:20,899
There's an emergency here,

1814
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,227
someone needs
to make a phone call.

1815
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:23,876
All right, yeah, no, I'll-
I'll call you back.

1816
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,882
Yeah, I need the number of a-a
restaurant in Brooklyn on Beach Walk

1817
01:19:32,907 --> 01:19:34,281
called Capri Pizzeria.

1818
01:19:42,638 --> 01:19:45,426
-Capri, John speaking.
<i>-Capri?</i>

1819
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:48,285
Yeah, I-I-I need to speak
with a-a customer

1820
01:19:48,356 --> 01:19:51,224
she-she-she has a--
she has blond-blond...

1821
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:56,323
<i>Hello?</i>

1822
01:19:58,799 --> 01:19:59,877
<i>Hello?</i>

1823
01:20:02,935 --> 01:20:05,060
<i>Capri, hello?</i>

1824
01:20:24,849 --> 01:20:27,177
Isn't it the best pizza
you've ever had in your life?

1825
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,490
And I'm taking you.

1826
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:30,997
I have something
I wanna tell you.

1827
01:20:31,138 --> 01:20:32,818
If only it wasn't so fattening.

1828
01:20:32,872 --> 01:20:34,513
But of course, you don't
have to worry about that.

1829
01:20:34,586 --> 01:20:35,921
A few things

1830
01:20:36,203 --> 01:20:37,469
that I wanna tell you.

1831
01:20:37,555 --> 01:20:38,499
Yes?

1832
01:20:39,278 --> 01:20:40,442
First,

1833
01:20:41,449 --> 01:20:42,793
I'm in love with you.

1834
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:44,747
You'll think I'm very silly

1835
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:47,763
but I believe firmly
in love at first sight.

1836
01:20:47,891 --> 01:20:52,110
Maybe because I'm a writer and
we over-romanticize but

1837
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,095
you just rang some
sort of a bell with me

1838
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,892
the minute I laid eyes on you.

1839
01:20:57,488 --> 01:20:59,269
I don't know what to say.

1840
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,949
I-I don't want you
to say anything.

1841
01:21:03,044 --> 01:21:05,169
I-I don't expect you
to say anything.

1842
01:21:05,724 --> 01:21:07,333
But I still wanted you to know.

1843
01:21:08,107 --> 01:21:09,912
I'm glad you feel that way.

1844
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:14,947
Now I'm going to tell
you something that

1845
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,306
you're going to have
complicated feelings about

1846
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,314
and you may not be
so thrilled to hear it but

1847
01:21:19,339 --> 01:21:20,947
I have to be honest.

1848
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,174
Hm.

1849
01:21:22,955 --> 01:21:25,017
Why, I suddenly get nervous?

1850
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:28,392
I've been having
an affair with Ginny.

1851
01:21:29,934 --> 01:21:30,903
That's right.

1852
01:21:31,356 --> 01:21:33,926
She's very unhappily
married to your father and

1853
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,276
we met at the beach
and it began and

1854
01:21:36,354 --> 01:21:38,026
while I like her very much--

1855
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:41,185
and I've even tried to
convince myself that I love her,

1856
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,764
but I'm just not in love with her.

1857
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:46,701
And she's looking for
someone to pull her out of

1858
01:21:46,726 --> 01:21:48,561
her unhappy marriage and

1859
01:21:48,936 --> 01:21:50,373
it's never going to be me.

1860
01:21:50,623 --> 01:21:53,201
So, I'm going to break
with her either way.

1861
01:21:54,114 --> 01:21:57,394
But I still wanted you to
know the...the whole story.

1862
01:21:58,684 --> 01:22:00,747
This is gonna kill my father.

1863
01:22:01,842 --> 01:22:03,702
He's so dependent on her.

1864
01:22:05,692 --> 01:22:06,473
How...

1865
01:22:07,059 --> 01:22:09,036
How awful for Ginny, I...

1866
01:22:10,895 --> 01:22:12,418
Oh, God, I...

1867
01:22:13,574 --> 01:22:17,020
I told her we were going for
dinner here tonight and that I...

1868
01:22:17,818 --> 01:22:21,216
I hoped that you'd finally
tell me how you felt about me.

1869
01:22:22,422 --> 01:22:23,399
And I did.

1870
01:22:24,876 --> 01:22:27,040
I don't know how
to take all of this.

1871
01:22:28,271 --> 01:22:29,685
I'm sure you don't.

1872
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,131
It just seems to go from
one drama to another.

1873
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:36,361
-Can we get the check?
-I-I'll get it.

1874
01:22:36,486 --> 01:22:39,411
No, no, no, no.
No. It's uh,

1875
01:22:39,817 --> 01:22:41,044
It's my treat.

1876
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:44,716
Thank you.

1877
01:22:46,577 --> 01:22:49,413
Hey, my car's just around
the corner. I'll drop you off.

1878
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:50,593
I prefer to walk.

1879
01:22:50,866 --> 01:22:52,475
Okay. Well, I'll walk with you.

1880
01:22:52,522 --> 01:22:54,796
No, I have a lot
of thinking to do.

1881
01:22:56,576 --> 01:22:58,404
Yeah, okay.

1882
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,677
Yeah, got it.
Um, well, I'll call you later.

1883
01:23:01,787 --> 01:23:05,076
And I'm-I'm sorry if I upset you.

1884
01:23:05,659 --> 01:23:07,127
It's a lot to take in.

1885
01:23:09,166 --> 01:23:10,823
It's nice to know you love me.

1886
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:55,202
Yes?

1887
01:23:55,413 --> 01:23:57,194
You take out my
daughter last night?

1888
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,530
Oh, you're Carolina's father.

1889
01:23:59,624 --> 01:24:01,232
I-I'm Mickey Rubin,
I'm happy to meet you.

1890
01:24:01,295 --> 01:24:02,655
Yeah, well, where is she?

1891
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:05,030
Now? Isn't she at work?

1892
01:24:05,055 --> 01:24:07,678
No, no, she didn't come in,
I already called.

1893
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:10,147
She didn't come
home last night?

1894
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,764
She didn't stay with you?

1895
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:13,350
No, she went home.

1896
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:17,287
Listen, you could tell me the truth,
I'm kinda worried about her.

1897
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:20,456
We had a pizza at Capri
Pizzeria and then we left.

1898
01:24:20,481 --> 01:24:21,832
We had a nice time.

1899
01:24:22,012 --> 01:24:24,942
I offered to drive her home and-
and she said she wanted to walk.

1900
01:24:25,113 --> 01:24:27,230
I-I told your daughter that
I cared for her very much and

1901
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,013
and she wanted time
to think things over.

1902
01:24:29,054 --> 01:24:30,123
-Wait, what do you mean
-She didn't

1903
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,332
-she didn't come home?
-sleep at your place?

1904
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:33,319
No, I-I-I'm telling you,
we split up after dinner.

1905
01:24:33,351 --> 01:24:34,561
I told her I'd call her.

1906
01:24:34,624 --> 01:24:35,655
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
call the police

1907
01:24:35,686 --> 01:24:37,786
they're gonna wanna check
your place out, you know that.

1908
01:24:37,811 --> 01:24:39,583
Listen, she wasn't at my place.

1909
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:42,662
I live in Greenwich Village,
they're free to check it out.

1910
01:24:42,935 --> 01:24:44,849
Which way did she go
when you split up?

1911
01:24:45,098 --> 01:24:46,684
She went over toward
the boardwalk

1912
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:49,083
a-a-and I walked around
the block to get my car.

1913
01:24:50,022 --> 01:24:51,397
If you're lyin' to me,

1914
01:24:51,459 --> 01:24:52,537
if you're lyin' to me,
you're gonna be

1915
01:24:52,562 --> 01:24:54,006
in a lot of trouble,
you know that?

1916
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:56,717
Take it easy, I'm as
alarmed as you are.

1917
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:01,370
Did she tell you that these-
these guys are after her?

1918
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,462
I knew her whole story, but-
but she didn't walk around

1919
01:25:03,495 --> 01:25:07,299
as if she was worried about it
and I-I didn't see anybody.

1920
01:25:07,919 --> 01:25:09,661
Where the hell is she?!

1921
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:18,427
What's the matter, Mom?

1922
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,139
Nothing.

1923
01:25:21,811 --> 01:25:23,022
Why are you drinking?

1924
01:25:24,654 --> 01:25:26,756
-This is my first.
-Third.

1925
01:25:27,772 --> 01:25:29,264
Can I go to the movies?

1926
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:31,437
The picture at the
Neptune changed.

1927
01:25:31,796 --> 01:25:32,734
Oh, yeah?

1928
01:25:33,789 --> 01:25:34,976
What's there?

1929
01:25:35,312 --> 01:25:36,781
<i>Flying Down to Rio.</i>

1930
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:39,359
Oh, Rio de Janeiro?

1931
01:25:39,892 --> 01:25:41,681
That sounds pretty good,
doesn't it?

1932
01:25:41,744 --> 01:25:43,330
Yeah, you wanna come?

1933
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,516
To Rio?

1934
01:25:44,805 --> 01:25:46,383
Or to the movies?

1935
01:25:47,026 --> 01:25:48,814
I'd like to go to Rio

1936
01:25:48,939 --> 01:25:51,095
and never come back.

1937
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:53,508
They got her.

1938
01:25:54,102 --> 01:25:56,141
They got Carolina.

1939
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:59,049
Somehow, they knew where she was

1940
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,596
and they snatched her.

1941
01:26:00,641 --> 01:26:01,735
W-Why do you say that?

1942
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,298
I knew it! I knew it!

1943
01:26:03,342 --> 01:26:05,053
-Give me that!
-No, no, Humpty! No!

1944
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,865
I'm not gonna argue with you,
you give me a hard time

1945
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,725
I'm gonna knock you through
the goddamn window.

1946
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:11,100
-Give it to me!
-No, okay, okay, okay

1947
01:26:11,206 --> 01:26:12,815
Okay, calm down.

1948
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:16,048
I know, no.
No. They meant

1949
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:18,627
They meant to get her.
They meant to kill her.

1950
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:20,550
And by now...
she's probably dead.

1951
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:23,723
W-What are you talking about?
You don't know anything.

1952
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:25,701
Don't tell me I don't know
what I'm talkin' about

1953
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:27,608
I wasn't born yesterday.

1954
01:26:27,702 --> 01:26:29,819
They knew exactly
where she was

1955
01:26:29,873 --> 01:26:31,475
right down
to the pizza joint.

1956
01:26:31,545 --> 01:26:33,412
I'm going to the movies,
can I have fifty cents?

1957
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:36,221
Goddammit.
Here, here, here!

1958
01:26:36,471 --> 01:26:37,448
Take it!

1959
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:38,979
Take it! Take it all!

1960
01:26:39,264 --> 01:26:41,671
Now you don't have to
steal it, I gave it to ya.

1961
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,631
Okay, well, d-did you
call the police?

1962
01:26:43,685 --> 01:26:46,529
-Well, naturally!
-Well, they'll find her.

1963
01:26:48,737 --> 01:26:50,168
What the hell do you care?

1964
01:26:50,402 --> 01:26:52,738
What the hell do you care?
You don't even like her.

1965
01:26:53,214 --> 01:26:54,582
You hated her.

1966
01:26:55,457 --> 01:26:57,347
You were the one
who wanted her out.

1967
01:26:57,691 --> 01:26:59,589
-Stop it.
-No!

1968
01:27:00,043 --> 01:27:03,292
No, y-you were the one
makin' all the cracks

1969
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:05,487
about how I'm too close to her.

1970
01:27:05,797 --> 01:27:07,390
Yeah, you coulda tipped 'em.

1971
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:09,406
Well, I didn't so don't be crazy!

1972
01:27:09,431 --> 01:27:11,852
If you did, I will--
I will kill you.

1973
01:27:12,006 --> 01:27:13,826
Stop! You're scaring me.

1974
01:27:13,951 --> 01:27:15,459
-Stop drinking!
-No, no.

1975
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:18,240
Somehow, for some reason,
they knew.

1976
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:19,936
They knew.
Why did they come back?

1977
01:27:19,998 --> 01:27:21,592
Well, it wasn't me,
I'd never do that

1978
01:27:21,655 --> 01:27:25,694
I... I wouldn't know who or how
if I... w-wanted to.

1979
01:27:25,743 --> 01:27:27,766
What-what do you--
What do you mean?!

1980
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:29,501
What do you mean
if you wanted to?

1981
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:30,837
-I would--
-Did you?!

1982
01:27:30,862 --> 01:27:32,509
I could never do
such a thing, okay?

1983
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:34,383
Leave me alone,
you're hurting me.

1984
01:27:34,501 --> 01:27:36,361
Ah! You're hurting me.

1985
01:27:36,477 --> 01:27:39,884
Ginny, I'm sorry, I-I can't
believe this. I'm going nuts!

1986
01:27:39,946 --> 01:27:40,555
I...

1987
01:27:40,618 --> 01:27:42,352
She finally comes back
and now this...

1988
01:27:42,434 --> 01:27:45,160
I don't wanna be around you
when you're like this.

1989
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:47,277
Stay here!
I don't wanna be alone!

1990
01:27:47,355 --> 01:27:48,785
I can't handle this without you.

1991
01:27:48,839 --> 01:27:51,106
I gotta get some air,
God, I'm choking.

1992
01:27:53,527 --> 01:27:55,238
Ginny, I can't believe this.

1993
01:27:55,348 --> 01:27:57,262
I can't believe she's gone.

1994
01:27:57,354 --> 01:27:59,096
Well, don't--
well, don't look at me

1995
01:27:59,129 --> 01:28:01,261
don't-don't--
don't stare at me.

1996
01:28:02,253 --> 01:28:03,635
You look funny.

1997
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:07,925
-You're imagining it.
-God damn it!

1998
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:10,536

01:29:08,762 --> 01:29:10,247
I came to speak to you.

2012
01:29:11,171 --> 01:29:12,546
Well, yes, but do you
think it was wise

2013
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,367
to show up at my door,
I mean...

2014
01:29:14,531 --> 01:29:16,234
I do have a husband, you know.

2015
01:29:17,779 --> 01:29:18,935
My God.

2016
01:29:20,474 --> 01:29:22,396
I was not expecting anyone.

2017
01:29:23,129 --> 01:29:25,629
I must look like the
wreck of the Hesperis.

2018
01:29:26,371 --> 01:29:29,074
I thought about it but in the
end, I decided to come here.

2019
01:29:31,026 --> 01:29:32,237
You're gonna tell me that

2020
01:29:32,377 --> 01:29:34,862
you've made a terrible mistake
in throwing away a relationship

2021
01:29:34,887 --> 01:29:36,835
with a woman you now
realize loved you

2022
01:29:36,867 --> 01:29:38,422
in a way that you will probably

2023
01:29:38,585 --> 01:29:40,124
never experience again.

2024
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,515
Still...

2025
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:44,955
it was reckless of you
to come to where I live.

2026
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:47,258
It just so happens

2027
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:51,117
Humpty's out, he's uh,
he-he got drunk and

2028
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:53,443
he-he accused me of
unspeakable things.

2029
01:29:53,545 --> 01:29:55,928
I mean, he's understandably
distraught, but

2030
01:29:56,053 --> 01:29:57,967
but he scares me, he

2031
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:01,044
he scares me.

2032
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,130
But I will say,
I told him many times,

2033
01:30:03,224 --> 01:30:05,560
"You're smothering that girl.
It's not healthy."

2034
01:30:05,622 --> 01:30:08,770
I mean, she's-she-she's a grown
woman, she's a divorcee, I...

2035
01:30:08,926 --> 01:30:10,856
I mean, she thinks
she was 15 years old

2036
01:30:10,896 --> 01:30:12,865
the way he fussed
over her and hovered.

2037
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:14,232
But

2038
01:30:14,568 --> 01:30:16,927
did she act strange when
you had dinner with her?

2039
01:30:17,233 --> 01:30:19,154
Because she is a
strange creature.

2040
01:30:19,209 --> 01:30:21,280
I w--I-I warned you about that.

2041
01:30:21,397 --> 01:30:23,584
I mean, for all we know,
you know,

2042
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:24,990
maybe she's gone
back to her husband

2043
01:30:25,015 --> 01:30:27,560
or decided maybe Mexico
is best for her.

2044
01:30:27,686 --> 01:30:29,592
But I did warn you
she was smart.

2045
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:32,441
You cast me aside
for a marked woman.

2046
01:30:32,581 --> 01:30:34,276
And now, I hope
you're not asking,

2047
01:30:34,301 --> 01:30:35,511
"Is it possible"

2048
01:30:35,581 --> 01:30:38,245
to just pick up where
we left off", I mean, that's--

2049
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,737
it's a little opportunistic,
wouldn't you say?

2050
01:30:40,886 --> 01:30:42,979
I mean, kinda reads that way.

2051
01:30:43,081 --> 01:30:44,175
And when it comes to love,

2052
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,839
we often turn out to be
our own worst enemy.

2053
01:30:47,752 --> 01:30:49,932
I suppose one of the
advantages of being,

2054
01:30:49,993 --> 01:30:52,776
well, older is that
we have more tolerance

2055
01:30:52,901 --> 01:30:54,969
for mistakes because
over the years

2056
01:30:54,994 --> 01:30:57,298
we all have made our share.
That's...

2057
01:30:57,805 --> 01:31:01,641
That's why forgiveness
is possible.

2058
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:05,461
What a cold world
it would be without it.

2059
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:10,020
I know the whole story, Ginny.

2060
01:31:12,231 --> 01:31:13,348
What story?

2061
01:31:15,285 --> 01:31:17,481
I know what it is
you did.

2062
01:31:19,059 --> 01:31:21,191
I-I don't know
what you're referring to.

2063
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:25,405
Oh, you've suddenly adopted a rather
supercilious tone of voice.

2064
01:31:25,577 --> 01:31:28,537
By now she's probably rubbed
out or dumped somewhere.

2065
01:31:28,811 --> 01:31:30,209
God, this is awful.

2066
01:31:30,334 --> 01:31:33,857
"Rubbed out", "dumped".
My goodness!

2067
01:31:33,972 --> 01:31:36,855
Don't you think you're being
a little melodramatic?

2068
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,144
I put it together.

2069
01:31:39,925 --> 01:31:42,885
I spoke to Humpty,
to Tiny.

2070
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:45,594
The phone at Ruby's
was out of order.

2071
01:31:46,446 --> 01:31:47,719
You used a pay phone.

2072
01:31:48,778 --> 01:31:50,793
I spoke to John from Capri.

2073
01:31:52,684 --> 01:31:53,949
A woman called.

2074
01:31:54,223 --> 01:31:55,988
And then hung up.

2075
01:31:57,538 --> 01:31:58,460
I got it.

2076
01:31:59,179 --> 01:32:01,195
It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes

2077
01:32:01,257 --> 01:32:04,249
or-or Eugene O'Neill
to plot this one out.

2078
01:32:04,482 --> 01:32:05,966
A lifeguard can do it.

2079
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:08,872
I don't know
what you're implying.

2080
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:10,474
I'm not implying.

2081
01:32:11,177 --> 01:32:12,271
I'm accusing.

2082
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:15,322
Accusing me?

2083
01:32:15,415 --> 01:32:18,697
You certainly don't seem too
concerned by her disappearance.

2084
01:32:18,744 --> 01:32:19,977
How would you know?

2085
01:32:20,263 --> 01:32:22,208
What, because I'm not
a mass of hysteria

2086
01:32:22,309 --> 01:32:23,364
like her father,

2087
01:32:23,427 --> 01:32:25,458
who has an unnatural
attachment to her.

2088
01:32:25,497 --> 01:32:27,114
Plus, I think I should tell you

2089
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:29,149
I've had a few drinks.

2090
01:32:29,226 --> 01:32:32,101
I know I told you
I never drink but

2091
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:35,383
when I'm under severe
emotional strain, it's--

2092
01:32:35,809 --> 01:32:37,145
you know, it's just

2093
01:32:37,434 --> 01:32:40,340
somehow it's the only thing that
keeps my head from throbbing.

2094
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:41,957
You wanted her gone.

2095
01:32:42,418 --> 01:32:44,897
-Oh, please, you're delusional.
-No!

2096
01:32:45,036 --> 01:32:46,631
What--do you think
that I could--? No.

2097
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:49,827
I will--I am not going
to stand here

2098
01:32:49,925 --> 01:32:52,401
and have my character
sullied by

2099
01:32:52,426 --> 01:32:55,198
-wild and fantastical insinuations.
-I didn't think you had it in you.

2100
01:32:55,299 --> 01:32:57,666
-You had time to warn her.
-What, I lacked a vision stature

2101
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,316
And you hung up the phone!
-that I was too mediocre

2102
01:32:59,355 --> 01:33:01,824
a person to rise
to a tragic action.

2103
01:33:01,925 --> 01:33:04,371
Honey, I don't know
what fanciful scenario

2104
01:33:04,449 --> 01:33:05,855
you're writing
in your own mind, but

2105
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:07,666
-I suggest you get a grip
-You had time to warn her.

2106
01:33:07,691 --> 01:33:09,612
-on your imagination.
-You hung up the phone.

2107
01:33:11,428 --> 01:33:12,232
Well...

2108
01:33:13,412 --> 01:33:15,639
maybe in the end you
misread my body language.

2109
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:18,755
I mean, you said it wasn't
an exact science.

2110
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:20,122
You know.

2111
01:33:21,474 --> 01:33:22,692
I loved her.

2112
01:33:24,021 --> 01:33:25,716
Jesus Christ!

2113
01:33:26,341 --> 01:33:28,138
You just met her!

2114
01:33:29,995 --> 01:33:32,886
Well, no, I forgot,
you're a dreamer

2115
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:35,276
who believes in love
at first sight.

2116
01:33:35,301 --> 01:33:36,378
You know when I think of it.

2117
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:38,151
When I think of it, I could,
I could--

2118
01:33:38,315 --> 01:33:39,245
What?

2119
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:40,714
What?

2120
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:42,159
What?

2121
01:33:45,038 --> 01:33:47,108
And you, you!
You could live with this.

2122
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:48,179
Huh?

2123
01:33:50,259 --> 01:33:53,196
Oh, God, spare me
the bad drama.

2124
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:55,642
Oh, here. Here.

2125
01:33:56,829 --> 01:33:58,344
Why don't you kill me.

2126
01:33:58,672 --> 01:34:00,172
And avenge her, huh?

2127
01:34:00,422 --> 01:34:01,219
Isn't...?

2128
01:34:01,914 --> 01:34:04,258
Isn't that the way
it happened in a...

2129
01:34:04,336 --> 01:34:06,391
a theater in Athens?

2130
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,122
What good our police
with its job they do.

2131
01:35:08,348 --> 01:35:09,918
Police can't protect you.

2132
01:35:15,122 --> 01:35:16,786
You look a little crazier than me.

2133
01:35:21,131 --> 01:35:23,959
Why are you staring at me
like that. I'm fine.

2134
01:35:24,211 --> 01:35:25,711
Starin' at you like what?

2135
01:35:28,708 --> 01:35:30,451
What's with you
with the dress?

2136
01:35:31,803 --> 01:35:33,061
You're nuts.

2137
01:35:35,111 --> 01:35:38,166
You know, uh... don't get in
my nerves, Ginny, okay?

2138
01:35:38,856 --> 01:35:42,153
I-I swear to God,
I will smash you.

2139
01:35:42,676 --> 01:35:44,425
I'm not in a mood.

2140
01:35:46,384 --> 01:35:49,204
You--You look a little
crazy to me.

2141
01:35:50,844 --> 01:35:52,352
Leave me alone.

2142
01:36:09,647 --> 01:36:11,124
Ginny, sorry.

2143
01:36:13,204 --> 01:36:14,633
I'm sorry, Ginny.

2144
01:36:17,274 --> 01:36:18,719
Don't ever leave me.

2145
01:36:19,922 --> 01:36:21,523
It's not what you're thinkin',
was it?

2146
01:36:21,751 --> 01:36:24,805
I was thinking Richie'll
be home from the movies.

2147
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,250
Soon he'll be hungry.

2148
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,790
I don't believe what happened.

2149
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:38,223
You gotta get me through
this like you did...

2150
01:36:40,488 --> 01:36:42,597
Like you did, y-you know-
you got--

2151
01:36:42,691 --> 01:36:45,011
I gotta wash my uniform.

2152
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,110
Talked to Carney and Ryan.

2153
01:37:04,524 --> 01:37:06,560
They're goin' fishin' Labor Day.

2154
01:37:08,459 --> 01:37:09,701
You wanna go?

2155
01:37:12,334 --> 01:37:13,366
No.

2156
01:37:16,295 --> 01:37:17,974
