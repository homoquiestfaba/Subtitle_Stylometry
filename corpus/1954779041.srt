1
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,676
<i> WHAT WAS THAT?</i>

2
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,272
<i> ME AND MY BROTHER,</i>

3
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,240
        <i> WE'D JUST GOT</i>
     <i> OUT OF THE SHOWER,</i>

4
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,810
      <i> AND HE WAS ABOUT</i>
 <i> TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.</i>

5
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:19,645
      <i> AND WHILE MY MOM</i>
   <i> WAS TAKING CARE OF HIM</i>

6
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:22,247
       <i> 'CAUSE HE'S TINY,</i>

7
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,185
 -<i> I WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM,</i>
 <i>  DRYING OFF, WATCHING TV. </i>
     - FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

8
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,867
    <i> IN A MIAMI, FLORIDA,</i>
      <i> COURTROOM TODAY,</i>

9
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,636
 <i> FORMER PANAMANIAN DICTATOR,</i>
      <i> MANUEL NORIEGA--</i>

10
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,772
        -<i> HEY, CHRIS. </i>
  - WHOEVER THE NEWSCASTER WAS

11
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,874
    <i> STARTS KIND OF GETTING</i>
       <i> MY ATTENTION...</i>

12
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,777
          -<i> CHRIS. </i>
         -<i> SAYING LIKE,</i>
 <i>  "HEY, CHRIS. HEY, CHRIS."</i>

13
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,213
<i> HEY, CHRIS.</i>

14
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,682
      -<i> AND IT'S SAYING,</i>
       <i>  "DON'T WORRY."</i>
       <i> - DON'T WORRY.</i>

15
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,817
  <i> EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.</i>

16
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,687
        <i> AND ONE DAY,</i>
       <i> WE'LL BE BACK.</i>

17
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,561
<i> IT TERRIFIED ME.</i>

18
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,364
     I REMEMBER SCREAMING
        TO GET MY MOM,

19
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,500
    <i> BRINGING HER TO THE TV,</i>

20
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,569
  <i> WHO NOW WAS BACK TO DOING</i>
     <i> NORMAL NEWSCASTING,</i>

21
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,638
       BECAUSE THAT'S,
    YOU KNOW, WHAT IT WAS.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,641
      AND HER BASICALLY
   EXPLAINING TO ME, LIKE,

23
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,843
   "TVs DON'T TALK TO YOU.
     THAT'S RIDICULOUS."

24
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,812
      I'M DISENCHANTED,
    BECAUSE NOW I THOUGHT

25
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,914
SOMETHING REALLY COOL HAPPENED,

26
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,816
    AND THAT'S NOT A THING
         I REMEMBER,

27
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,752
      I KNOW IT WAS THERE.

28
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,787
        AND, YOU KNOW,
      I WAS WIDE AWAKE.

29
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,589
       I HAD LITERALLY
JUST GOTTEN OUT OF THE SHOWER,

30
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,726
     AND IT WAS THIS VERY
OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCE FOR ME

31
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,662
         BECAUSE NOW,
     AS A FIVE-YEAR-OLD,

32
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,932
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I BELONGED.

33
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,596
<i> OKAY. SET.</i>

34
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,635
<i> SO HOW DID THIS START, JEFF?</i>

35
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:28,774
         UM, PROBABLY
     ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.

36
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,376
MY GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME AND I
      WERE TALKING ABOUT

37
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,513
DIFFERENT PARANORMAL STORIES,
  AND SHE STARTED TELLING ME

38
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,748
     ABOUT HOW SOMETIMES
        SHE'D WAKE UP

39
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,383
  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

40
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,419
      JUST, LIKE, UNABLE
     TO MOVE OR BREATHE.

41
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,388
    SHE SAID IT FELT LIKE
        THERE'S, LIKE,

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,525
       AN EVIL PRESENCE
    IN THE ROOM WITH HER,

43
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,528
 AND THEY WOULD JUST, LIKE--
 KIND OF, LIKE, TORMENT HER.

44
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,929
   AND SHE WOULD EVENTUALLY
           WAKE UP,

45
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,699
       AND IT'D BE LIKE
     IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

46
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,434
    AFTER SHE TOLD ME THAT,

47
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,969
     I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
     WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

48
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,738
   I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I GOT
INVOLVED WITH SOME CRAZY GIRL."

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,774
  AND I JUST KIND OF CHANGED
         THE SUBJECT,

50
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,543
       STARTED TALKING
    ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

51
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:09,348
   THEN ABOUT A WEEK LATER,
 I LAID DOWN TO GO TO SLEEP.

52
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,351
    <i> AND JUST AS I STARTED</i>
        <i> TO DRIFT OFF,</i>

53
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,720
       <i> I FELT MY BODY</i>
<i> JUST BECOME EXTREMELY HEAVY.</i>

54
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,489
  <i> IT WAS LIKE I FELL ASLEEP,</i>

55
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,559
      <i> BUT THEN WOKE UP</i>
    <i> AT THE SAME INSTANT.</i>

56
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,562
      <i> AND MY WHOLE BODY</i>
      <i> STARTED TINGLING.</i>

57
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,464
      <i> IT JUST FELT LIKE</i>
    <i> REALLY WEIGHTED DOWN,</i>

58
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,466
<i> LIKE SOMETHING WAS PULLING ME.</i>

59
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,668
      AND I HEARD THIS,
         LIKE, SOUND.

60
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,503
 IT WASN'T OUTSIDE OF MY HEAD,

61
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,971
       BUT IT WAS JUST
      INSIDE OF MY HEAD.

62
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,973
       IT JUST SOUNDED
    LIKE A WASHING MACHINE

63
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,376
 THAT KIND OF OUT OF BALANCE
        OR SOMETHING,

64
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:41,813
JUST BANGING AGAINST THE WALL,
AND JUST REALLY TERRIFIED ME.

65
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,352
      I KIND OF STARTED,
     LIKE, FREAKING OUT,

66
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,688
          AND, LIKE,
    STARTED SEEING THINGS.

67
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,723
   AND IT WAS REALLY BIZARRE.

68
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,558
<i> WELL, WHAT DID YOU SEE?</i>

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,694
   UM, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE--

70
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,363
     IT WAS KIND OF LIKE...

71
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,731
  <i> ALL THESE DIFFERENT COLORS,</i>

72
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,734
   <i> LIKE A LASER LIGHT SHOW</i>
        <i> OR SOMETHING,</i>

73
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,871
   <i> LIKE, I WAS LIKE FLYING</i>
 <i> THROUGH, LIKE, A TIME WARP.</i>

74
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,540
<i> IT JUST HAD ALL THESE COLORS</i>
 <i> JUST, LIKE, SHOOTING AT ME</i>

75
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,642
       <i> IN A LIGHT SHOW.</i>

76
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,824
   <i> AND I FOUND THAT I HAD</i>
 <i> ZERO CONTROL OVER MY BODY.</i>

77
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,659
  <i> LIKE, NO MATTER HOW HARD</i>
          <i> I TRIED,</i>

78
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,762
  <i> I COULDN'T MOVE MY ARMS,</i>
      <i> MY LEGS, NOTHING.</i>

79
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,733
 <i> AND SO I REALLY STARTED TO</i>
 <i> KIND OF HAVE A PANIC ATTACK</i>

80
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,401
    <i> BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW</i>
     <i> WHAT WAS GOING ON.</i>

81
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,903
     <i> I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.</i>

82
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,639
    <i> I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE</i>
   <i> A STROKE OR SOMETHING.</i>

83
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,441
       <i> NOTHING WORKED.</i>
      <i> I COULDN'T MOVE.</i>

84
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,876
<i>I HAD NO CONTROL OVER ANYTHING.</i>

85
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,380
   <i> FINALLY I DECIDED, WELL,</i>

86
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,416
<i> I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO BUILD UP</i>
      <i> ALL THE STRENGTH</i>

87
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,951
      <i> THAT I HAVE IN ME</i>
     <i> JUST TO GET MYSELF</i>

88
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,953
        <i> TO ROLL OVER</i>
     <i> ONTO MY GIRLFRIEND</i>

89
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,622
 <i> HOPING THAT IT WAKES HER UP.</i>

90
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,726
     <i> SO IT WAS JUST LIKE</i>
   <i> THIS LAST-DITCH EFFORT</i>

91
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,394
     <i> OF EVERYTHING I HAD,</i>

92
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,396
        <i> I JUST, LIKE,</i>
      <i> WRENCHED MY BODY.</i>

93
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:08,800
  <i> AS SOON AS I FLIPPED OVER</i>
  <i> ON TOP OF HER, I WOKE UP.</i>

94
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,137
   <i> AND I WAS STILL LAYING</i>
   <i> IN MY ORIGINAL POSITION</i>

95
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,539
 <i> LIKE NONE OF IT HAD HAPPENED.</i>

96
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,508
<i> I WAS JUST COMPLETELY SHOCKED.</i>

97
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,810
        <i> I HAD NO IDEA</i>
     <i> WHAT WAS GOING ON.</i>

98
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,946
     <i> I JUST DID NOT KNOW</i>
     <i> WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.</i>

99
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,682
   AFTER THAT, IT WAS LIKE,
         CONSTANTLY,

100
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,450
      NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
         AFTER NIGHT,

101
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,653
     FOR A COUPLE WEEKS,
  MAYBE EVEN A MONTH OR SO.

102
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,390
             AND...

103
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,658
     I JUST DID NOT KNOW
HOW TO PROCESS IT AT THE TIME.

104
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,162
   AND SO, FINALLY, I TOLD
   MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT.

105
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,764
      I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME."

106
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,632
       "I THINK I NEED
     TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

107
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,901
 I THINK I'M HAVING STROKES,
      LIKE MINI-STROKES,

108
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,804
   OR SEIZURES MAYBE EVEN,"
       AND SHE'S LIKE,

109
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,774
     "NO, THAT'S EXACTLY
     WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.

110
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,176
   THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
     TO TELL YOU ABOUT."

111
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,987
<i> I WAS ABOUT 29 YEARS OLD.</i>

112
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,822
<i> MM-HMM.</i>

113
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,491
    <i> AND HERE IN THIS ROOM,</i>

114
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,727
 <i> AS I WOULD LAY DOWN TO SLEEP,</i>

115
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,964
 <i> I'D START FEELING TINGLING</i>
         <i> IN MY FEET,</i>

116
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:17,169
   AND THEN I WOULD FEEL IT
      RISE UP MY LEGS...

117
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,937
         UP MY TORSO,
         ON MY HANDS,

118
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,640
   AND I'D ALSO HEAR BUZZING.

119
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,942
          YOU KNOW,
      LIKE BEES BUZZING.

120
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,744
  THAT'S WHEN THESE EPISODES
         WOULD START.

121
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,446
    <i> I WOULD FEEL TINGLING</i>
      <i> AND I WOULD GET--</i>

122
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,548
     <i> I'D FEEL THE ENERGY.</i>

123
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,717
I FELT THAT MY MIND WAS AWAKE,
    BUT MY BODY WAS STIFF.

124
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,886
   I'D TRY TO MOVE MY HEAD
      FROM SIDE TO SIDE.

125
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,855
           I JUST--
       I COULDN'T MOVE.

126
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,184
      <i> AND IN THAT MOMENT,</i>

127
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,186
    <i> I WOULD HEAR TAPPING</i>
       <i> ON THE WINDOW.</i>

128
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,690
     THEY WOULD TAP HERE.
    I WOULD HEAR TAPPING.

129
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,725
   AND I'M THINKING, "WELL,
  MAYBE IT'S JUST A SQUIRREL

130
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,729
        OR A RACCOON,"
  BUT IT WAS LIKE A PATTERN.

131
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,730
   IT WAS DEFINITELY A KNOCK.

132
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,802
  AND I WOULD OPEN MY EYES,
AND I'D LOOK TOWARD THE WINDOW,

133
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,904
    AND THEN IT WOULD STOP.

134
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,973
       BUT AFTER A WHILE,

135
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,775
      I STARTED FEELING
     AN ACTUAL PRESENCE.

136
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,086
AND I WOULD FEEL THIS PRESENCE
       RIGHT NEXT TO ME

137
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,088
  TRYING TO TAKE MY SOUL OUT.

138
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,691
IT WOULD TORTURE ME AT NIGHT,
AND I WOULD TRY AND FIGHT IT,

139
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,927
     <i> BUT I FELT I WAS--</i>
   <i> MY BODY FELT PARALYZED.</i>

140
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,831
    IT WAS JUST SO STRONG
  THAT I WOULD JUST LET GO,

141
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,700
   AND THEN I'D FEEL MYSELF
     FLOATING IN THE AIR.

142
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,037
AND I COULD TRY AND SEE MYSELF,
 BUT I WOULD JUST SEE A BLUR.

143
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,611
       <i> AND IT HAPPENED</i>
    <i> FOR MANY YEARS, AND--</i>

144
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,947
     WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
      WITH MY DAUGHTER,

145
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:12,017
 AND I FELT THE BABY AS WELL,
     TRYING TO COME OUT.

146
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,086
BUT I WAS TRYING TO FIGHT IT,
 AND I WAS SAYING, "NO, NO."

147
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,956
    SO I WOULD PULL BACK.
IT'S LIKE IF I WOULD PULL BACK.

148
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,592
 AND IT WOULD PULL, YOU KNOW,
        THE OTHER WAY.

149
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,870
<i> WHEN I WAS IN</i>
     <i> MY MID TO LATE 20S,</i>

150
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,806
 <i> I HAD A REALLY AWFUL BREAKUP.</i>

151
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,309
   I WAS MISERABLE BECAUSE
   I WAS SO BROKENHEARTED.

152
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,344
AND I STARTED MY FIRST TEACHING
  JOB AROUND THE SAME TIME,

153
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,346
 SO I WAS SUPER STRESSED-OUT
          FROM THAT.

154
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,063
 I WOULD JUST SEE THIS, LIKE,
DARK FIGURE BY THE BOOKSHELVES,

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,767
    AND I COULD NOT MOVE,
AND IT WAS FUCKING TERRIFYING.

156
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,369
        I DIDN'T KNOW
     WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

157
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,037
  I DID THINK THAT SOMEBODY
          HAD BROKEN

158
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,139
 INTO MY APARTMENT AT FIRST,
    BECAUSE AT THAT POINT,

159
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,609
  MY ROOMMATE AND I LIVED--
   I HAD A ROOMMATE THEN--

160
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,010
   WE LIVED ON FOURTH STREET,

161
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,645
 AND WE WERE ON THE TOP FLOOR
       OF THE BUILDING.

162
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,081
       AND OUR BUILDING
 WAS REALLY EASY TO GET INTO.

163
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,783
    LIKE, THE DOOR IN FROM
 THE BALCONY TO OUR APARTMENT

164
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,820
     DIDN'T REALLY LOCK,
    SO I THINK I WAS LIKE,

165
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,855
          "OH, FUCK,
 SOMEBODY ACTUALLY BROKE IN."

166
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,791
 TO BE LYING THERE AND KNOW,
       I WANT TO MOVE,

167
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,793
   AND I'M TRYING TO MOVE,
        AND I CANNOT--

168
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,729
    <i> ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.</i>

169
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,369
<i> I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM</i>
<i> WITH STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.</i>

170
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,004
      <i> SLIPPING IN AND OUT</i>

171
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,672
     <i> OF DIFFERENT STATES</i>
      <i> OF CONSCIOUSNESS.</i>

172
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,808
      AND I DO REMEMBER...

173
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,277
       WHEN I WAS VERY,
         VERY YOUNG--

174
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,347
         TWO, THREE,
    I WAS STILL IN A CRIB.

175
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:53,251
        <i> AND THERE WAS</i>
   <i> A PLUG-IN NIGHT LIGHT,</i>

176
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,989
   <i> AND IT WAS THAT ORANGE</i>
         <i> CAST COLOR.</i>

177
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,760
     <i> AND IT WAS ALL DARK</i>
<i> EXCEPT FOR THAT ORANGE CAST,</i>

178
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,029
   <i> AND THE ROOM TURNED RED,</i>

179
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,264
  <i> AND I FELT LIKE SOMETHING</i>
    <i> WAS COMING AFTER ME,</i>

180
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,700
     <i> AND I CUDDLED DOWN</i>
     <i> AND COVERED MYSELF.</i>

181
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,186
  IT WAS MY EARLIEST MEMORY
       OF THE SCARINESS

182
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,322
     THAT HAPPENED TO ME
   AND CONTINUED TO HAPPEN.

183
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:36,194
 <i> LAYING DOWN TO GO TO SLEEP,</i>
<i>I WOULD FEEL UTTERLY EXHAUSTED,</i>

184
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,229
        <i> ALMOST AS IF</i>
  <i> I HAD JUST BEEN DRUGGED.</i>

185
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,999
      <i> I MEAN, YOU KNOW,</i>
<i> HAVING BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL,</i>

186
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,967
<i> I UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT'S LIKE.</i>

187
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,137
       <i> IT'S JUST LIKE</i>
    <i> I HAD BEEN INJECTED.</i>

188
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,941
  <i> AND MY EYES SEALED SHUT.</i>
    <i> MY MOUTH SEALED SHUT.</i>

189
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,377
  <i> AND IT'S AS IF EVERYTHING</i>
     <i> WAS SHUTTING DOWN,</i>

190
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,114
  <i> EXCEPT FOR MY AWARENESS,</i>
      <i> MY CONSCIOUSNESS.</i>

191
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,784
    <i> AND THEN I COULD FEEL</i>
        <i> A VIBRATION.</i>

192
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,886
 <i> SOMETIMES IT WAS SO INTENSE,</i>

193
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,956
        <i> IT FELT LIKE</i>
     <i> BEING ELECTROCUTED,</i>

194
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,993
    <i> BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY</i>
  <i> AN ELECTRICAL VIBRATION.</i>

195
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,797
   <i> I BEGAN HEARING VOICES</i>
         <i> AND SCREAMS</i>

196
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,733
- <i> AND CRYING... </i>

197
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,937
   <i> AND ALL OF THIS REALLY</i>
      <i> EMOTIONAL DRAMA,</i>

198
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,841
     <i> YELLING TO CRYING,</i>
  <i> BUT ALL NEGATIVE EMOTION,</i>

199
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,744
<i> ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT VOICES.</i>

200
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,146
    <i> AND THEN THAT IS WHEN</i>
       <i> THE SHADOW MAN</i>

201
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,949
     <i> WOULD COME TOWARD ME.</i>

202
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:34,753
<i> STUPID, STUPID, STUPID,</i>
   <i> STUPID, STUPID! STUPID!</i>

203
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,326
<i> AND HE LOOKED JUST LIKE</i>
 <i> A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SHADOW,</i>

204
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:45,263
    <i> OUTLINED, JUST PERFECT.</i>

205
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,933
    <i> AND HE WOULD WALK...</i>
         <i> DISJOINTED.</i>

206
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,808
       <i> AND HE BROUGHT</i>
   <i> THE VIBRATION WITH HIM.</i>

207
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,378
         <i> IT'S AS IF</i>
 <i> IT WAS EMANATING FROM HIM.</i>

208
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,816
<i> AND HE WOULD COME TOWARDS ME,</i>
 <i> AND I WOULD JUST FEEL THAT.</i>

209
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,818
         <i> HEAR-- HEAR--</i>

210
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,021
        <i> I WOULD HEAR</i>
  <i> ALL THE SOUNDS OF HELL--</i>

211
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,524
        <i> I DON'T KNOW</i>
  <i> ANY OTHER WAY TO PUT IT--</i>

212
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:16,561
 <i> AND FEEL HIS AWFUL VIBRATION.</i>

213
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:20,131
      <i> AND I WOULD HAVE</i>
  <i> A FIGHT/FLIGHT RESPONSE,</i>

214
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,233
   <i> AND I WOULD COMPLETELY,</i>
    <i> YOU KNOW, FREAK OUT,</i>

215
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,502
<i> AND TRY TO SCREAM OR GET AWAY.</i>

216
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,377
       <i> AND MANY TIMES,</i>
<i> THE INTENSITY JUST CONTINUED.</i>

217
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,146
      I WAS VERY SCARED,
     AND I WAS UPSTAIRS,

218
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,182
AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE ANYBODY
     WAS GONNA GET TO ME

219
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,017
         IF I SCREAMED.

220
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,052
        IT'S VERY DARK.

221
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,922
   AND IT SCARED ME FOREVER.

222
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:47,292
 I MEAN, IT REALLY SCARED ME
    TO THE END OF MY WITS.

223
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,128
       AND IF ANYTHING
  WAS GONNA DRIVE ME INSANE,

224
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,996
     IT WAS GONNA BE THAT.

225
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,941
       WHAT HAPPENS IS
 WHEN YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP,

226
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,909
YOU'LL GET AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK
      THROUGH YOUR BODY

227
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,213
JUST AS YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP,
AND THAT'S THE USUAL INDICATION

228
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,248
    THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
     A VISIT THAT NIGHT.

229
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,252
   <i> THEN YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP,</i>

230
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,555
  <i> AND THEN YOU'LL WAKE UP,</i>
<i> AND YOU'RE TOTALLY PARALYZED,</i>

231
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,123
        <i> YOU CAN'T MOVE.</i>

232
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,194
          UM, AND...
 THERE'S STATIC IN THE ROOM.

233
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:27,599
  AND YOU'RE BEING VISITED.
   THEY'LL CIRCLE YOUR BED,

234
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,134
      AND NOW AND AGAIN,
  THEY'LL TRY AND TOUCH YOU.

235
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:34,606
        <i> THE FIRST ONE</i>
 <i> IS A GENERIC SHADOW PERSON,</i>

236
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,909
   <i> WHICH IS JUST BASICALLY</i>
  <i> AN OUTLINE OF ME AND YOU</i>

237
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:41,079
       <i> ON A SUNNY DAY,</i>
      <i> ON THE PAVEMENT,</i>

238
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,315
       <i> ON THE SIDEWALK</i>
       <i> IN A 3-D FORM.</i>

239
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,622
       <i> AND THE SECOND--</i>

240
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,992
     <i> THE SECOND ENTITY,</i>
    <i> WHICH IS THE HAT MAN,</i>

241
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,361
 <i> SEEMS TO HAVE A DIRECT LINK</i>
          <i> TO THEM.</i>

242
00:14:56,363 --> 00:15:00,265
     <i> HE'S-- HE'S A VERY</i>
    <i> AUTHORITARIAN FIGURE.</i>

243
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,300
      <i> HE'S VERY MENACING.</i>

244
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,370
          <i> HE'S VERY--</i>

245
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,206
    <i> HE'S IN CHARGE OF THEM.</i>

246
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,008
        <i> HIS MINIONS,</i>
        <i> SO TO SPEAK.</i>

247
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,644
          <i> AND, UM...</i>

248
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,179
       <i> THEY'RE A TEAM.</i>
         <i> IT'S HELL.</i>

249
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:19,217
   HE'S AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL.

250
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,953
   IT ALL STARTS WITH THAT
      ELECTRICAL SHOCK.

251
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,172
 I HAVE MY TWO SEPARATE LIVES.

252
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,341
     I HAVE MY LIFE LIKE
 WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT IT,

253
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,410
AND IT'S COOL AND I GO TO WORK.

254
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,245
     THEN WHEN I GO TO BED,

255
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,114
 I HAVE THIS WHOLE OTHER LIFE
  THAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

256
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,116
    WHEN IT FIRST STARTED,
 IT WAS PRETTY INTERMITTENT.

257
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,484
      IT WASN'T EVERY DAY.

258
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:58,389
     DON'T KNOW THE AGE.
      AROUND THIS TIME.

259
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,725
   <i> MY BROTHER DIDN'T LIVE</i>
      <i> WITH US ANYMORE,</i>

260
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,194
      <i> AND I HAD MY ROOM</i>
       <i> ALL TO MYSELF.</i>

261
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:06,998
     <i> IT'S KIND OF FUNNY</i>
    <i> 'CAUSE I CAN REMEMBER</i>

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,134
     <i> MY BED HAD COLLAPSED,</i>

263
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,271
 <i> ONTO A BOX OF BEANIE BABIES</i>
   <i> THAT MY MOM COLLECTED.</i>

264
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,739
  <i> MY MOM WAS A BIG COLLECTOR.</i>

265
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,009
<i> AND SO MY BED KIND OF PIVOTS,</i>
           <i> RIGHT?</i>

266
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,978
    <i> ON TOP OF THIS THING</i>
      <i> THERE'S A FRAME,</i>

267
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,679
       <i> THE BED PIVOTING.</i>

268
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,449
       <i> AND I REMEMBER</i>
    <i> THE BED WAS PIVOTED,</i>

269
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,718
   <i> ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT,</i>

270
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,020
        <i> WITH MY FEET</i>
    <i> CLOSER TO THE GROUND</i>

271
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,756
   <i> AND MY HEAD HIGHER UP,</i>
       <i> LIKE A SEESAW.</i>

272
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,193
       <i> AND I REMEMBER</i>
    <i> THE PARALYSIS STARTS,</i>

273
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,763
 <i> AND I CAN SEE THE DOOR FRAME.</i>

274
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,433
      <i> LIKE I CAN SEE--</i>
  <i> I'M LOOKING DIRECTLY AT--</i>

275
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,168
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>
   <i> I'M LOOKING AT A WALL,</i>

276
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,170
  <i> AND THE DOOR IS RIGHT HERE.</i>

277
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:50,108
<i> SO, HERE'S A BED, THERE'S ME,</i>
   <i> THEN STRAIGHT FORWARD,</i>

278
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,709
<i> THERE'S THE DOOR THAT EXITS,</i>
           <i> RIGHT?</i>

279
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,112
    AND THERE'S THE LIGHT
      FROM THE HALLWAY.

280
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,315
   <i> AND I REMEMBER SEEING,</i>
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>

281
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,317
 <i> YOUR TRADITIONAL DARKNESS,</i>
       <i> YOUR, YOU KNOW,</i>

282
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,420

         <i> IN SHADOWS.</i>

283
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:06,357
  <i> I MEAN, IT ALL LOOKS LIKE</i>
        <i> IT'S MOVING.</i>

284
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,459
 <i> ALL THE DARKNESS LOOKS ALIVE.</i>

285
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,700
   <i> BUT I REMEMBER SEEING...</i>

286
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:53,471
  <i> PEOPLE, BEINGS, WHATEVER,</i>
       <i> JUST COMING IN.</i>

287
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,074
         <i> THEY JUST--</i>
         <i> THEY LOOK--</i>

288
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,542
      <i> THEY LOOK LIKE A--</i>

289
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,178
  <i> IF A PERSON WERE TO WALK</i>
    <i> IN FRONT OF A LIGHT,</i>

290
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
      <i> AND THEIR SHADOW</i>
    <i> WERE TO FOLLOW THEM,</i>

291
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,149
 <i> THEY LOOKED LIKE AN ALMOST--</i>

292
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,485
  <i> MORE SHADOW-LIKE VERSION</i>
        <i> OF A SHADOW.</i>

293
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,654
     LIKE-- AND KIND OF...

294
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,126
           JUST...
     DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

295
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:19,197
    LIKE, I REMEMBER NOW,
             UM,

296
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,500
THAT THEY WOULD-- THEY JUST--
      SHADOWS MOVING IN,

297
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,570
      <i> LIKE, THEY WOULD</i>
<i> KIND OF INTERSECT THE LIGHT.</i>

298
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,107
<i> I ACTUALLY-- I REMEMBER THIS</i>
      <i> KIND OF WELL NOW,</i>

299
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,843
      <i> BECAUSE I WAS ON</i>
      <i> THIS WEIRD TILT,</i>

300
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,811
     SO IT WASN'T JUST ME
         LOOKING UP,

301
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,546
     OR, LIKE, BEING ABLE
    TO KIND OF SEE AROUND.

302
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,682
     THIS WAS ME LOOKING
    STRAIGHT AT THE DOOR.

303
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:42,153
 <i> AND JUST SEEING THESE THINGS.</i>

304
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:45,890
<i> I REMEMBER IN THE PARALYSIS,</i>
<i> I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE REAL.</i>

305
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,792
  I ALWAYS THINK THEY'RE REAL.

306
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,694
      EVEN TO THIS DAY,
I THINK THESE THINGS ARE REAL

307
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:53,164
      IN SOME SENSE, UM...

308
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,833
     BUT WHEN I WOKE UP,
     THEY WEREN'T THERE.

309
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,803
      IT WAS DEFINITELY
        THE FIRST TIME

310
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,207
     THAT I SAW SOMETHING
       THAT MADE THINK

311
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,445
      THAT THIS WAS MORE
 THAN JUST A SLEEP DISORDER.

312
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,324
   I DO REMEMBER IT HAPPENING

313
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,395
         AS FAR BACK
 AS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

314
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:27,198
     AS FAR BACK AS MAYBE
    FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD.

315
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,305
          <i> AND THEN</i>
   <i> THE SAME THING HAPPENED</i>

316
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,207
     <i> WHEN I WAS ABOUT 15.</i>

317
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,880
      DURING THAT TIME,
 I WAS A REBELLIOUS TEENAGER,

318
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:47,351
SO I WAS REALLY OUT OF CONTROL
      AND FEELING, LIKE,

319
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,220
      <i> UNLOVED AND STUFF.</i>

320
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,490
      <i> I DON'T KNOW HOW</i>
       <i> I GOT THAT WAY,</i>

321
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,426
   <i> BUT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE</i>
    <i> A BROKENNESS INSIDE,</i>

322
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,496
  <i> LIKE, I WAS JUST BROKEN,</i>
     <i> SPIRITUALLY BROKEN.</i>

323
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,898
        <i> AND THAT TIME,</i>

324
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,768
  <i> I WAS IN A TWO-STORY HOME</i>
        <i> IN TORRANCE,</i>

325
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,336
     <i> THE CITY OF TORRANCE.</i>

326
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,841
    <i> IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE</i>
        <i> OF THE NIGHT,</i>

327
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,610
     <i> BUT I WAS WIDE AWAKE.</i>

328
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,512
 <i> I WAS LITERALLY WIDE AWAKE.</i>
     <i> MY EYES WERE OPEN.</i>

329
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,914
    <i> BUT I COULD NOW FEEL</i>
       <i> THIS PRESENCE,</i>

330
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,217
 <i> THIS EVIL PRESENCE BEHIND ME.</i>

331
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,357
      LYING ON MY SIDE,
    LIKE ON MY LEFT SIDE--

332
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,292
      I'M A SIDE SLEEPER--

333
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,229
      AND THEN THE DOOR
        IS BEHIND ME.

334
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:36,367
       <i> AND-- AND THEN</i>
  <i> I COULD FEEL THE PRESENCE</i>

335
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,936
     <i> JUST RIGHT BEHIND ME.</i>

336
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,405
       <i> AND I REMEMBER</i>
      <i> JUST TRYING TO--</i>

337
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,841
       <i> WANTING TO MOVE</i>
      <i> AND TURN AROUND,</i>

338
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,310
<i> BUT I COULD NOT LIFT A FINGER.</i>

339
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,347
       <i> AGAIN, IT WAS--</i>
    <i> I WAS JUST FROZEN...</i>

340
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,816
      <i> UTTERLY IN TERROR.</i>

341
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,584
       <i> AND IT WAS THE--</i>

342
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,454
     <i> IF I COULD DESCRIBE</i>
<i> WHAT DEATH WOULD FEEL LIKE--</i>

343
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,024
   AND IT'S A KIND OF HORROR

344
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,960
        THAT IS WORSE
   THAN LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

345
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:07,298
    UM, IT'S AN ICY-COLD,
         KIND OF DARK

346
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,334
 <i> EVIL SOMETHING'S IN THE ROOM,</i>

347
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,836
     <i> AND IT'S WATCHING ME.</i>

348
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,604
    <i> THAT'S THE SCARY PART.</i>

349
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,507
    <i> THAT YOU FEEL A SENSE</i>
   <i> THAT IT'S WATCHING YOU.</i>

350
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,875
     <i> AND IT'S-- AND IT'S--</i>

351
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,878
       AND IT'S MAKING
       YOU FEEL AFRAID.

352
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,414
       AND IT WANTS YOU
       TO FEEL AFRAID.

353
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,460
 I WAS A YEAR AND A HALF OLD,
          PROBABLY.

354
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:42,433
  AND I WAS BORN AND RAISED
       IN RURAL VERMONT

355
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,603
IN AN OLD FARMHOUSE ABOUT 100,
     100-PLUS YEARS OLD,

356
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,872
   AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
        OF THE WOODS.

357
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:51,509
   UM, SO IT WAS VERY DARK
       AND VERY QUIET,

358
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,711
      <i> JUST PITCH SILENCE,</i>

359
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,880
      <i> WHICH, YOU KNOW,</i>
 <i> ITSELF KIND OF HAS A SOUND.</i>

360
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,816
           UM, AND--

361
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,618
        SO HERE I AM,
         I'M A BABY.

362
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,454
          I WAKE UP
      AND I CAN'T MOVE.

363
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,723
        I'M IN MY CRIB.

364
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:09,460
    AND SO I'M SURROUNDED
         BY THE BARS

365
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,462
   OF THE CRIB ON ALL SIDES.

366
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:15,366
        AND ABOVE ME,
   AT THE END OF THE CRIB,

367
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,034
       BEFORE THE WINDOW,

368
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,638
  <i> ARE TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC...</i>

369
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,474
   <i> KIND OF, BEINGS, I GUESS.</i>

370
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:27,812
        UH, BEST WORD
      TO DESCRIBE THEM.

371
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,780
 I STILL REMEMBER THEM VIVIDLY

372
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,450
    BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY
       MY FIRST MEMORY.

373
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,051
          SO IN A WAY,

374
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,021
         IT'S KIND OF
 MY AWAKENING INTO THE WORLD.

375
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,524
             DARK.

376
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,526
         THEY ALWAYS
    JUST LOOK SO CARTOONY.

377
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:47,498
I'VE TRIED TO DRAW THEM BEFORE,
 AND IT JUST LOOKS SO GOOFY.

378
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:55,539
  IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE, UH,
 THE SAME MALEVOLENT IMPACT.

379
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,076
      AND THEIR SKIN, UM,

380
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,079
  WAS LIKE TELEVISION STATIC.

381
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,815
    UM, YOU KNOW, IT HAD,
          YOU KNOW--

382
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,151
       LIKE AN OLD TV,
     WHEN THE SIGNAL'S--

383
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,620
   WHEN YOU'RE NOT GETTING
        A GOOD SIGNAL.

384
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,522
   IT HAD THAT SAME KIND OF
           TEXTURE,

385
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,457
<i> THAT KIND OF--</i>

386
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,535
       THEY WERE TALL,
        KIND OF THIN,

387
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:28,672
   THESE KIND OF THIN LIMBS
   AND THESE LONG FINGERS.

388
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,075
         AND THEY HAD
   THESE VERY SIMPLE FACES,

389
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,111
 ALMOST CARTOONISH FACES OF,
          YOU KNOW,

390
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:38,616
     THESE TWO INKY EYES
   AND THIS BIG INKY SMILE

391
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,718
        ON THEIR FACE
       THAT'S KIND OF--

392
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,655
   IT'S TICKLING, TICKLING,
      TICKLING FINGERS,

393
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,024
  THESE, LIKE, LONG, SLENDER--

394
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,894
      THEY WERE LAUGHING.

395
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,963
AND HERE'S MY LITTLE FEET,
     YOU KNOW.

396
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,637
    THEY WERE TICKLING ME.
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS PARALYZED.

397
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,906
       I COULDN'T MOVE,
  AND I COULDN'T STOP THEM.

398
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,641
   <i> AND THEY WERE LAUGHING</i>
          <i> ABOUT IT.</i>

399
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,676
THERE WAS KIND OF LIKE LAUGHTER.
       LIKE, AH-HA-HA.

400
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,144
   THEY WERE, LIKE, THERE,
          YOU KNOW?

401
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,013
           AND BARS,

402
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,782
  THESE TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC
     THINGS, THE WINDOWS.

403
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,626
          YOU KNOW,
  ACCORDING TO MY PARENTS--

404
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:26,063
   <i> BUT I KEPT ON REPEATING</i>
     <i> THE WORDS "ZINES."</i>

405
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,900
       LIKE, Z-I-N-E-S,
     OVER AND OVER AGAIN

406
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,836
    IN LIKE KIND OF A PANIC.

407
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,904
        KIND OF LIKE,
    "ZINES, ZINES, ZINES,"

408
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,539
       YOU KNOW, LIKE,
     HANGING ON TO THEM.

409
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,710
   AND SO MAYBE AS A CHILD,
          YOU KNOW,

410
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,812
      SEEING THESE KIND
      OF ANTHROPOMORPHIC

411
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:46,750
SORT OF NOT HUMAN BUT HUMAN--
            UH...

412
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,825
     SO I WOULDN'T SLEEP
      IN MY CRIB AGAIN.

413
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,928
       MY PARENTS TRIED
    TO PUT ME IN MY CRIB,

414
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,129
   AND I JUST WOULDN'T DO IT.

415
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,731
     I WOULD JUST SCREAM
          AND SCREAM

416
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,033
    AND SCREAM AND SCREAM
         AND SCREAM.

417
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,069
         I MADE THIS
    AS A HALLOWEEN COSTUME

418
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,872
        SOME YEARS AGO.

419
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:11,075
      NOW YOU'RE STARING
 INTO MY CHILDHOOD RIGHT NOW.

420
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,978
        I DON'T KNOW.
         IS IT SCARY?

421
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,563
<i> DID YOU SEEK ANY MEDICAL HELP?</i>

422
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,733
  NO, BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
      I WAS GOING CRAZY.

423
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:39,770
I KNEW WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING
          WAS REAL.

424
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,639
  I DIDN'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE
     TO COME AND TELL ME,

425
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:42,940
  "WELL, NO, THAT'S NOT REAL."

426
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,576
<i> DID YOU SEEK ANY KIND OF HELP?</i>

427
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,678
 <i> DID YOU TRY TO DO ANYTHING</i>
 <i> TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING?</i>

428
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,148
    DID I GET AN EXORCIST?
  NO, I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH.

429
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,051
    <i> I GOT ON THE INTERNET</i>
         <i> VERY EARLY</i>

430
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,655
  <i> COMPARED TO MOST PEOPLE,</i>
     <i> IN ABOUT '94 MAYBE.</i>

431
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:00,591
    <i> I'M TOTALLY GUESSING.</i>
          <i> '94, '95.</i>

432
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,593
     <i> AND ONE OF THE VERY</i>
  <i> FIRST THINGS I LOOKED UP,</i>

433
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,695
     <i> WAS "THE SHADOWMAN"</i>
      <i> AND "NIGHTMARE."</i>

434
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:07,031
       AND FROM THERE,
    IN THE SEARCH ENGINES,

435
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,733
   IT WASN'T VERY FAR DOWN
 THE PAGE-- SLEEP PARALYSIS.

436
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,069
      <i> I WAS LIKE, WAIT,</i>
<i> SLEEP FROZEN, SLEEP PARALYSIS.</i>

437
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,338
   <i> AND I CALLED MY MOM UP</i>
         <i> RIGHT AWAY.</i>

438
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,807
 <i> I SAID, "OH, MY GOSH, MOM,</i>
    <i> IT'S SLEEP PARALYSIS.</i>

439
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,944
  <i> THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT.</i>
       <i> IT'S A THING."</i>

440
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:22,046
   SHE WAS VERY EXCITED, TOO,

441
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,148
 AND SHE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND
MORE ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE FELT

442
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,117
 THAT MAYBE SOMETHING MEDICAL
        COULD BE DONE

443
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,886
  SO THAT WE NO LONGER HAD IT.

444
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,888
 BECAUSE WHEN THE SCIENTISTS
        FIGURE IT OUT,

445
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,123
  THEY FIGURE OUT A MEDICINE
    TO GO WITH IT, RIGHT?

446
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:37,027
   SO WE FELT THAT WE WOULD
    ACTUALLY HAVE ANSWERS

447
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,897
 AND MEDICATION OR SOMETHING
      TO MAKE IT BETTER.

448
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,900
      I CALLED A DOCTOR
   AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT

449
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,769
  AND CAME IN, AND EXPLAINED
  TO THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON,

450
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,373
     AND MY DOCTOR SAID--
  SHE WAS KIND OF CONCERNED

451
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,076
THAT MAYBE I WAS HAVING SEIZURES
    WHILE I WAS SLEEPING.

452
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:56,780
SO SHE SET ME UP FOR A CAT SCAN,
     AN EEG AND ALL THAT.

453
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,616
    SO I WENT IN FOR THOSE,

454
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:02,920
        AND MY RESULTS
FOR THE CAT SCAN WERE NORMAL,

455
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:07,625
 BUT THE EEG CAME BACK WITH--
 SAID I HAD ABNORMAL RESULTS.

456
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,926
      THAT'S ALL SHE SAID.

457
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,795
          "YOU HAVE
   SOME ABNORMAL READINGS.

458
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,698
  "YOU HAVE SLEEP PARALYSIS.
 IT'S JUST CAUSED BY STRESS.

459
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,667
     SO IF YOU JUST MAKE
   SOME LIFESTYLE CHANGES,

460
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,135
        IT'LL GO AWAY."

461
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:23,340
WELL, YOU GET A CUT-AND-PASTE
     ANSWER FROM DOCTORS,

462
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:27,077
      "YOU'RE STRESSED.
   CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE,"

463
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,380
        WITHOUT ASKING
   WHAT YOUR LIFESTYLE IS.

464
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,348
       THERE'S NO ANSWER.

465
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,386
  IT'S JUST A DISMISSAL OF--
 BASICALLY, THEY DON'T KNOW.

466
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:36,987
    AND IF THEY DON'T KNOW,

467
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,056
      THEN THEY DON'T--
       THEY DON'T CARE.

468
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,359
   EVERY TIME I WOULD TALK
TO A PSYCHIATRIST, I'D BE LIKE,

469
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,728
"I'M HAVING THIS SLEEP PROBLEM.
    THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

470
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,398
  THIS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE."
 THEY'D BE LIKE, "OKAY, OKAY.

471
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,367
TELL ME ABOUT, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
 HOW ARE YOU DOING AT HOME?"

472
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,102
 AND I WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO BE
      LIKE, "NO, NO, NO,

473
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:56,173
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS HIDEOUS
    SLEEP PROBLEM I HAVE."

474
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,376
SHE SEEMED REALLY INTERESTED.
    SHE SORT OF LEANS IN.

475
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,011
       AND SHE'S LIKE,
   "IT'S NOT SLEEP APNEA."

476
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,780
 AND I WAS LIKE, "I KNOW THAT."

477
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:05,416
      AND SHE JUST SAID,
  "THAT'S REALLY MESSED UP."

478
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,870
<i> I REMEMBER, LIKE,</i>
     <i> THE FOLLOWING NIGHT</i>

479
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,940
   <i> AFTER IT WOULD HAPPEN,</i>
<i> I'D LAY IN BED BEING SO SCARED</i>

480
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,909
<i>THAT IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.</i>

481
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,845
  <i> AND THEN, MOST ASSUREDLY,</i>
    <i> IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN</i>

482
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,414
<i> 'CAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT</i>
   <i> AND OBSESSING ABOUT IT.</i>

483
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,484
  LIKE, WHEN I'D GO THROUGH
      THESE DRY SPELLS,

484
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,152
          BASICALLY,
  WHERE I WASN'T HAVING IT,

485
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,088
IF I STARTED TELLING SOMEBODY
          ABOUT IT,

486
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,457
      THEN IT WAS, LIKE,
    ALMOST 100% GUARANTEED

487
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,392
       THAT I WAS GONNA
     HAVE IT THAT NIGHT.

488
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,163
          THIS IS IN
    OUR COLLEGE APARTMENT.

489
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:56,333
<i> OKAY. </i>
       - SO, I WAS HERE.

490
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,347
  <i> I HAD MY BED RIGHT HERE...</i>

491
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,484
    <i> AND THEN MY ROOMMATE</i>
       <i> WAS RIGHT HERE.</i>

492
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,490
        <i> AND THE BLOBS--</i>

493
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,059
   I SAW THESE BLACK BLOBS--

494
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,864
       <i> I COULD SEE THEM.</i>

495
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:30,434
       <i> BLOBS OF BLACK,</i>
     <i> COMING ONTO MY BED.</i>

496
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,987
<i> AND I COULD SEE MY ROOMMATE,</i>
<i> JUST IN THE CORNER OVER THERE,</i>

497
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,356
      <i> AND I WAS TRYING</i>
     <i> TO SCREAM HER NAME</i>

498
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,825
  <i> SO THAT SHE COULD HELP ME.</i>

499
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,462
  <i> AND SHE'S SLEEPING AWAY,</i>
 <i> AND I'M STRAINING TO TALK.</i>

500
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,397
   <i> AND NOTHING CAN COME OUT.</i>

501
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:21,952
<i> I'M A DIVER,</i>
   <i> AND I'VE EXPERIENCED--</i>

502
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:24,855
  <i> WELL, BEEN CLOSE TO DEATH</i>
     <i> QUITE A FEW TIMES.</i>

503
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:27,424
      I'M A DEEP DIVER,
 BUT NOTHING'S AS TERRIFYING,

504
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,859
        AS WHAT HAPPENS,

505
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,861
      AND I HAVE IT ONCE
       OR TWICE A WEEK.

506
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,163
<i> WHEN I WAS ABOUT 10</i>
<i> IS WHEN IT STARTED TO HAPPEN,</i>

507
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,999
  <i> EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY DAY</i>
         <i> OF MY LIFE.</i>

508
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,569
  NOBODY EVER REALLY TOOK ME
ENTIRELY SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW,

509
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:42,105
         EVEN THOUGH
I WAS A PETRIFIED LITTLE BOY,

510
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:45,309
YOU KNOW, TERRIFIED TO BE ALONE,
      HATED MY BEDROOM,

511
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:49,847
HATED THE ROOM BELOW MY BEDROOM,
   AND HAD SLEEP PARALYSIS

512
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,015
     <i> PROBABLY EVERY NIGHT.</i>

513
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,218
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>
  <i> HAD VOICES TALKING TO ME</i>

514
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,087
   IN THE SLEEP PARALYSIS,
  VERY ABUSIVE EXPERIENCES.

515
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,989
<i> HEY, FORREST.</i>

516
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,959
<i>-  HEY, FORREST. </i>
<i>-  HEY, FORREST.</i>

517
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:06,897
<i> YOU JUST WON THE</i>
<i>GIANT INSECT OF THE MONTH CLUB.</i>

518
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,600
<i> INSECT OF THE MONTH CLUB.</i>

519
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:14,972
<i> WE'RE SENDING YOUR FIRST PRIZE</i>
<i> UP TO YOUR BEDROOM RIGHT NOW.</i>

520
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,912
     YOU KNOW, AND AGAIN,
IT GOES BACK TO THE FACT THAT,

521
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:24,047
 YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT WASN'T
   LIKE A REAL EXPERIENCE--

522
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,049
     IF SOMEBODY HAD COME
       INTO MY BEDROOM,

523
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,019
   AND SOME CREEPY GUY WAS
WHISPERING TO ME EVERY NIGHT,

524
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,320
          YOU KNOW,
 MY PARENTS WOULD DEFINITELY

525
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,089
 HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

526
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,925
  BUT THE FARTHEST THEY WENT
   WAS KIND OF BEING LIKE,

527
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,928
"WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE HIM
   TO A PSYCHOLOGIST? NO."

528
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,166
<i> I WAS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP.</i>

529
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:47,638
  <i> I FELT THIS OVERWHELMING</i>
   <i> PRESSURE COME OVER ME.</i>

530
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,607
 AND MY BREATHING JUST STOPPED.

531
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,919
     <i> MY BODY WAS TRYING</i>
     <i> TO KIND OF TELL ME,</i>

532
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,921
  <i> "I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF NOW.</i>

533
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,957
   <i> AND YOU HAVE THE OPTION</i>
       <i> TO STOP THAT."</i>

534
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,964
    <i> IF I WANT TO CONTINUE</i>
         <i> TO BREATHE,</i>

535
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:17,634
 <i> I HAVE TO ACTIVELY OVERRIDE</i>
 <i> WHATEVER ELSE IS GOING ON.</i>

536
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,338
     <i> I HAVE TWO OPTIONS--</i>

537
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,407
  <i> EITHER TRY TO BREAK FREE</i>
      <i> OF THE PARALYSIS</i>

538
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,109
         <i> OR I BREATHE.</i>

539
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,147
      YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
    KIND OF THE BEGINNING,

540
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,952
  AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING
    OF ME BEING AFRAID OF,

541
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:38,021
     NOT GOING TO SLEEP,
        BUT, YOU KNOW,

542
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,124
I WOULD JUST PRESSURE MYSELF,
   TO WAIT TILL EXHAUSTION

543
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,960
       TO FALL ASLEEP,
      FOR THE MOST PART,

544
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:47,030
      'CAUSE AFTER THAT,
    IT JUST NEVER STOPPED,

545
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,333
      UM... KIND OF EVER.

546
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:54,137
<i> I'LL GET IT</i>
    <i> JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE.</i>

547
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,139
<i>SOME PLACES WILL BE MUCH WORSE.</i>

548
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,578
        <i> AND THE VOICE</i>
   <i> IS DIFFERENT BY PLACE.</i>

549
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:12,055
   UM... I HAD AN APARTMENT
          IN BOSTON.

550
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,057
   I LIVED IN JAMAICA PLAIN
    IN BOSTON FOR A WHILE

551
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,759
      ABOVE A PIZZA PLACE,

552
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,028
   AND I WOULD ALWAYS HEAR
    THIS MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

553
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,763
SINGING IN A BABY'S VOICE THERE,

554
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,602
   THIS GRADUALLY FADED AWAY

555
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,337
     UNTIL I PRETTY MUCH
        ALMOST FORGOT

556
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,040
   I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED IT.

557
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:33,610
 AND I... THOUGHT I WAS GOOD,
        FINALLY OVER.

558
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,212
     IT WAS JUST A PHASE
     I WAS GOING THROUGH,

559
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,280
       AND NOW IT'S DONE.

560
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:41,051
        ONE AFTERNOON,
  I WAS UP DOING HOUSEWORK,

561
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,086
     AND WAS KIND OF TIRED,

562
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,288
        AND I FIGURED
I'LL LAY DOWN AND TAKE A NAP,

563
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,657
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GO OUT WITH
SOME FRIENDS LATER ON TONIGHT.

564
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:51,161
     SO I WENT, LAID DOWN,

565
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:55,399
AND SET THE ALARM ON MY PHONE,
    CHECKED, SAW THE TIME,

566
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:58,068
  <i> AND JUST KIND OF THREW IT</i>
<i> ON THE NIGHTSTAND NEXT TO ME,</i>

567
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,203
      AND JUST LAID DOWN.

568
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:04,641
            AND...
 AS I STARTED TO FALL ASLEEP,

569
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,645
 I FELT, LIKE, THIS TINGLING
   SENSATION COME OVER ME,

570
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,248
     AND SINCE I HAD BEEN
   DEALING WITH IT SO LONG,

571
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,816
     IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
     A FAMILIAR FEELING,

572
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,618
 <i> IT WAS LIKE THE WARNING SIGN,</i>

573
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,320
   <i> "OKAY, SLEEP PARALYSIS</i>
    <i> IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN."</i>

574
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:20,357
 LIKE, MY BODY WOULD TINGLE,
     START TO FEEL HEAVY.

575
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,393
        I'D SEE, LIKE,
 ALL THESE PIXILATED COLORS,

576
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,797
    AND SO I SET MYSELF UP
      TO WAKE MYSELF UP,

577
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,099
     KIND OF SHAKE IT OFF.

578
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:33,270
   SO THEN... IT FELT LIKE
        IT WENT AWAY.

579
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:36,206
       SO I JUST, LIKE,
     PICKED UP MY PHONE,

580
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,810
     LOOKED AT THE TIME,
     OKAY, LAID BACK DOWN

581
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,179
  AND STARTED GOING TO SLEEP.

582
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:45,682
  AND JUST AS I FELL ASLEEP,
        MY PHONE RANG.

583
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,652
- <i> AND SO I LAID THERE</i>
       <i>  FOR A SECOND. </i>

584
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,788
<i> I WAS LIKE, "DO I ANSWER IT,</i>
     <i> DON'T I ANSWER IT?"</i>

585
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,356
       <i> JUST FELL ASLEEP,</i>

586
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,092
     <i> AND NOW SOMEBODY'S</i>
        <i> WAKING ME UP.</i>

587
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,393
    <i> SO FINALLY, I GAVE IN</i>
     <i> AND I ANSWERED IT.</i>

588
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,162
     <i> I GRABBED MY PHONE.</i>
          <i> "HELLO?"</i>

589
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,131
       <i> WHEN I DID THAT,</i>

590
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:04,701
 <i> THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END</i>
 <i> OF THE LINE SAID, "HELLO,"</i>

591
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,403
   THEY SAID SOMETHING ELSE
  I COULDN'T REALLY MAKE OUT

592
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,805
  'CAUSE IT WAS ALL STATICKY
       AND CUTTING OUT.

593
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,575
         <i> SO I SAID,</i>
  <i> "I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.</i>

594
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,410
     <i> YOU'RE BREAKING UP.</i>
 <i> THERE'S A BAD CONNECTION."</i>

595
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:18,248
   <i> I SAID, "HELLO," AGAIN,</i>
       <i> AND I WAS LIKE,</i>

596
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,319
    <i> "YOU'RE BREAKING UP.</i>
  <i> I CAN'T, LIKE, HEAR YOU."</i>

597
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,788
      <i> AND SO, FINALLY I--</i>

598
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,324
   <i> TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHAT</i>
<i> THEY WERE SAYING AND WHATNOT.</i>

599
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:30,827
    <i> AND I DECIDED I'M UP.</i>
<i> I'M GONNA GO GET A CIGARETTE.</i>

600
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,196
         SO, I GOT UP,

601
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,599
     JUST TALKING TO HIM,
    LIKE, "HELLO, HELLO?"

602
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,702
 <i> AND THEN FINALLY I'D WALKED</i>
  <i> OUT INTO THE LIVING ROOM,</i>

603
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:41,338
    AND JUST AS I GOT OUT
     IN THE LIVING ROOM,

604
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,674
         <i> IT BECAME--</i>
  <i> THE CONNECTION CLEARED UP</i>

605
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:48,879
AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END
 WAS THIS VERY PLEASANT MAN.

606
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:50,680
      HE WAS LIKE, "HELLO.

607
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:53,183
       <i> I WAS WONDERING</i>
<i> IF YOU COULD DO ME A FAVOR."</i>

608
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,885
      WHAT KIND OF FAVOR?

609
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,159
<i> LET ME IN.</i>

610
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,261
<i> I FREAKED OUT.</i>

611
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:07,397
<i> I WAS, LIKE, THERE'S A DEMON</i>
<i> ON THE OTHER END OF MY PHONE.</i>

612
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,932
     <i> I WANTED NOTHING TO</i>
        <i> DO WITH THIS.</i>

613
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,368
     <i> SO I THREW MY PHONE</i>
       <i> ACROSS THE ROOM</i>

614
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,637
   <i> AND IT BROKE INTO PIECES,</i>

615
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,407
  <i> THEN EVERYTHING AROUND ME</i>
<i> JUST WENT INTO COMPLETE CHAOS.</i>

616
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:20,644
      <i> THEN JUST LIKE--</i>
<i> ALMOST LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE HIT.</i>

617
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:23,647
<i> LIKE, EVERYTHING WAS SHAKING</i>
          <i> AND DARK.</i>

618
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,782
        <i> MY WHOLE BODY</i>
     <i> STARTED VIBRATING.</i>

619
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,651
        <i> IT FELT LIKE</i>
    <i> SOMETHING WAS TRYING</i>

620
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,787
  <i> TO RIP ME OUT OF MYSELF,</i>
<i> KIND OF LIKE PULL MY SOUL OUT.</i>

621
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,893
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>
<i> JUST TRYING TO PROCESS THIS,</i>

622
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:38,795
   <i> LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON,</i>
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>

623
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,830
  <i> JUST ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED.</i>

624
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,733
    <i> AND SO THE ONLY THING</i>
     <i> I COULD THINK TO DO</i>

625
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,535
  <i> WAS I JUST STARTED PRAYING.</i>

626
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,871
     <i> I WAS, LIKE, "GOD,</i>
  <i> IF YOU'RE THERE, HELP ME.</i>

627
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,973
<i> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.</i>

628
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,942
        <i> JUST, PLEASE,</i>
     <i> SOMEBODY HELP ME."</i>

629
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:54,678
  <i> AND AS SOON AS I SAID THAT,</i>

630
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,280
     I FELT LIKE SOMEBODY
 JUST GRABBED ME FROM BEHIND,

631
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,383
 JUST, LIKE, YANKED ME BACK,
     LIKE, DOWN THE HALL,

632
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,819
       AND JUST, LIKE,
SLAMMED ME BACK INTO MY BODY.

633
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,721
   AND, LIKE, I HIT MY BODY,

634
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,791
AND I, LIKE, SAT UP INSTANTLY
  AND, LIKE, LOOKED AROUND,

635
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,694
        AND WAS LIKE,
    "DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?

636
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,729
        WAS THAT REAL?"

637
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,265
 AND SO THE FIRST THING I DID
 WAS GRAB MY PHONE, YOU KNOW.

638
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,767
I'M LIKE LOOKING THROUGH, "OKAY,
   WHO DID I JUST TALK TO?"

639
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,704
       AND, LIKE, NO--
  THERE WAS NO MISSED CALLS

640
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,740
OR NO ANSWERED CALLS OR NOTHING,
  AND I LOOKED AT THE TIME,

641
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,909
    AND IT HAD ONLY BEEN,
      LIKE, TWO MINUTES

642
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,912
 SINCE I INITIALLY LAID DOWN
       TO GO TO SLEEP.

643
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,881
     UM, I DID TELL MY MOM,

644
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,351
         AND SHE JUST
  KIND OF TOLD ME I'M NUTS.

645
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:36,720
SHE'S LIKE, "IT WAS A BAD DREAM.
  IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME."

646
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,789
          "NO, MOM.
     IT WASN'T A DREAM."

647
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:07,717
<i> I WAS IN SEVENTH</i>
      <i> OR EIGHTH GRADE,</i>

648
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,054
       <i> ABOUT '87 OR '88.</i>

649
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:14,758
   <i> AND I SAW "A NIGHTMARE</i>
       <i> ON ELM STREET"</i>

650
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,662
       <i> WITH MY MOTHER,</i>
  <i> THANK GOODNESS, ON CABLE.</i>

651
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,664
      <i> AND SHE WAS LIKE,</i>
        <i> "OH, MY GOSH!</i>

652
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,300
  <i> THIS IS LIKE OUR DREAMS,"</i>
<i>AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I KNOW."</i>

653
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,869
   <i> SO WE DEFINITELY AGREED</i>
          <i> ON THAT.</i>

654
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:29,372
<i> AND I KEPT WATCHING IT BECAUSE</i>
<i> I WANTED TO FIND SOME CLUES,</i>

655
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,841
         <i> SOME ANSWER</i>
    <i> TO WHAT WAS GOING ON.</i>

656
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,077
 <i> AND OF COURSE, THEY MENTION</i>
    <i> A LITTLE BIT OF MYTH</i>

657
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,714
 <i> IN THE MOVIE BUT NOT ENOUGH</i>
     <i> TO REALLY RESEARCH.</i>

658
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:41,384
DID YOU EVER READ ABOUT
THE BALINESE WAY OF DREAMING?

659
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,987
                             NO.

660
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,890
THEY GOT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM
THEY CALL DREAM SKILLS.

661
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,059
    THEY GET ALL THEIR ART
 AND LITERATURE FROM DREAMS,

662
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,860
         JUST WAKE UP
      AND WRITE IT DOWN.

663
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,729
         <i> DREAM SKILLS.</i>

664
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:56,666
 WHAT IF THEY MADE A MONSTER
 IN THEIR DREAMS, THEN WHAT?

665
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,577
    WHEN I WAS-- YOU KNOW,
WE HAD HBO WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

666
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,480
 AND MY DAD WAS VERY LIBERAL
       WITH LETTING US

667
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,749
   WATCH WHATEVER WE WANTED
       TO WATCH ON HBO.

668
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:18,388
<i> ONCE HE WAS WATCHING A MOVIE,</i>
<i>AND I JUST KIND OF WANDERED IN.</i>

669
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,457
    <i> I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW</i>
     <i> WHAT THE MOVIE WAS.</i>

670
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,360
     <i> AND THEN THIS, UH...</i>

671
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:26,129
      <i> CREATURE EMERGES</i>
   <i> FROM BEHIND A DRESSER.</i>

672
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,398
       <i> AND IT'S LIKE--</i>
       <i> IT'S AN ALIEN.</i>

673
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
     <i> AND IT'S LIKE THE--</i>
<i> IT WAS THE MOVIE "COMMUNION,"</i>

674
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,470
           <i> WITH--</i>
      <i> WHAT'S HIS FACE?</i>

675
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,372
           <i> THE GUY</i>
<i> WHO WAS IN THE DANCING VIDEO.</i>

676
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,741
        <i> I DON'T KNOW.</i>
     <i> CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.</i>

677
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:40,844
       <i> YEAH, EXACTLY.</i>
     <i> CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.</i>

678
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:45,482
  <i> AND WHEN I SAW THAT FACE...</i>

679
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,817
  <i> MY MIND IMMEDIATELY DREW</i>
         <i> A PARALLEL</i>

680
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,453
<i>TO THE THINGS I HAD EXPERIENCED</i>
         <i> AS A CHILD,</i>

681
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:51,888
     <i> AND I WAS PETRIFIED.</i>

682
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,157
         <i> I REMEMBER</i>
    <i> JUST BEING PETRIFIED.</i>

683
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,526
            <i> AND--</i>
    <i> AND THEN, YOU KNOW--</i>

684
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,095
    <i> BUT I STAYED WATCHING</i>
 <i> AS THIS, LIKE, LITTLE KID.</i>

685
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,169
       <i> AND, YOU KNOW,</i>
   <i> THESE IMAGES I REMEMBER</i>

686
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,671
<i> AS INCREDIBLY SHOCKING IMAGES</i>
     <i> TO ME, AS A CHILD.</i>

687
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,140
       <i> BECAUSE IT WAS</i>
       <i> THE FIRST TIME</i>

688
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,642
   <i> THAT THE KIND OF THINGS</i>
       <i> THAT I HAD SEEN</i>

689
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,612
 <i> ALIGNED WITH SOMETHING THAT--</i>

690
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:19,149
    <i> THAT WAS KNOWN ABOUT</i>
      <i> OR WAS EXPLORED.</i>

691
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,917
 A BUNCH OF PEOPLE CAME OVER,
      AND THEY'RE LIKE,

692
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,752
      "LET'S WATCH THIS
     'INSIDIOUS' MOVIE."

693
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,654
       AND I WAS LIKE,
    "YEAH, SURE, WHY NOT?

694
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:28,491
  I DON'T CARE," AND, LIKE--
ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE,

695
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,494
<i> I'M LIKE, "THIS IS ABOUT SLEEP</i>
<i> PARALYSIS, I'M PRETTY SURE."</i>

696
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,530
   <i> I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,</i>
    <i> THAT'S KIND OF COOL.</i>

697
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:36,433
        <i> SOMEBODY MADE</i>
  <i> A HORROR MOVIE ABOUT IT."</i>

698
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,935
       WHEN, YOU KNOW,
THE DUDE'S, LIKE, IN THE CHAIR,

699
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:43,206
HE JUST GOES INTO THIS WORLD,
AND HE'S SEARCHING FOR THE KID.

700
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,208
    <i> THEY'RE PULLING FROM</i>
   <i> SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS</i>

701
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,544
   <i> OF SLEEP PARALYSIS LORE.</i>

702
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,512
        <i> THE SHADOW MAN.</i>

703
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,653
<i> I KEPT LEAVING MY BODY.</i>

704
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:59,722
       <i> THE NIGHT HAG.</i>
        <i> THE OLD HAG.</i>

705
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:03,593
    I SAT THERE AND, LIKE,
JUST KIND OF GETTING ANNOYED.

706
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,662
           I MEAN,
    I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

707
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,230
       IT WASN'T LIKE,
     "THIS MOVIE SUCKS!"

708
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,699
       I MEAN, IT WAS--
         IT WAS OKAY.

709
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,601
          AND THEN,
       ALL OF A SUDDEN,

710
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,736
        THEY DO, LIKE,
   THE HEAD SHAKING THING,

711
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,506
    LIKE THIS, LIKE, WEIRD--

712
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,108
 IT WAS IN "JACOB'S LADDER,"
    AND IT FREAKED ME OUT.

713
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,110
         I WAS LIKE,
"THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS."

714
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:25,114
 AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
           I EVER--

715
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:29,719
   I SAW SOMEBODY REPRESENT
     WHAT IT FEELS LIKE--

716
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,255
         OR I GUESS,
   NOT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE--

717
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,591
      WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
  IT LOOKS LIKE TO BE IN IT,

718
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:36,693
  LIKE WHEN I'M COMING OUT,
       LIKE, SOMETIMES

719
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,495
      <i> MY JAW WILL, LIKE,</i>

720
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,597
    <i> JUST FUCKING GO BACK</i>
    <i> AND FORTH REAL QUICK,</i>

721
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,600
<i> OR, LIKE, MY HEAD WILL SHOOT</i>
     <i> FROM SIDE TO SIDE.</i>

722
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,802
   <i> AND IT'S WHAT I IMAGINE</i>
       <i> IT LOOKS LIKE.</i>

723
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:49,606
     <i> EVEN MY GIRLFRIEND,</i>
        <i> SHE WAS LIKE,</i>

724
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:52,675
          YOU KNOW,
 "THOSE WEIRD HEAD MOVEMENTS,

725
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,845
LIKE, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT'S
    LIKE FOR ME TO WATCH,

726
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,282
          YOU KNOW,
EXCEPT NOT MAGICALLY BLURRY."

727
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,551
 THAT'S THE SLEEP PARALYSIS.
     HEY, IT'S GOT TO BE.

728
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:04,687
<i> YEAH, I HAD MY OWN</i>
  <i> SLEEP PARALYSIS EPISODE,</i>

729
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,257
   <i> AND, WELL, IN THAT ONE,</i>
<i> IT WAS SORT OF LIKE A CLASSIC</i>

730
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:08,925
     <i> THREE-DIMENSIONAL,</i>
      <i> BLACK SHADOW MAN,</i>

731
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,127
  <i> WHO CAME UP IN THE WOODS</i>
      <i> BEHIND MY HOUSE,</i>

732
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,897
      <i> LEANED OVER MY BED.</i>

733
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:17,233
         <i> AND I THINK</i>
 <i> MAYBE A YEAR OR TWO LATER,</i>

734
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,536
 <i> I SAW "NATURAL BORN KILLERS."</i>

735
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:23,139
    <i> AND THERE'S A SCENE,</i>
<i>AND IT GOES BY JUST IN A FLASH,</i>

736
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:27,210
  <i> WHERE THAT GUY IS, LIKE,</i>
   <i> IN THE OPENING CREDITS,</i>

737
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:31,848
    <i> COMING THROUGH, LIKE,</i>
  <i> THIS STRANGE RED TUNNEL,</i>

738
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,917
     <i> CLOUDY VORTEX THING.</i>

739
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:37,587
<i> I THINK IT'S OVER THE CREDIT</i>
<i> OF "PRODUCER ARNON MILCHAN."</i>

740
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,956
<i> BUT IT WENT BY IN A FLASH,</i>

741
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,325
    <i> AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN</i>
     <i> KIND OF COMPLICATED</i>

742
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,193
    <i> TO CALL INTO EXISTENCE.</i>

743
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,229
       <i> SO I WAS LIKE,</i>
    <i> "WHY WAS THAT THERE?"</i>

744
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,798
   <i> AND I STILL DIDN'T KNOW</i>
  <i> WHAT SLEEP PARALYSIS WAS.</i>

745
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,334
        I DIDN'T KNOW
 THAT ANYONE ELSE HAD HAD IT.

746
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:54,671
   SO I SAW THAT AND ALMOST
KIND OF TOOK IT AS A MESSAGE,

747
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:57,674
      LIKE, "THE PEOPLE
      WHO MADE THIS FILM

748
00:42:57,676 --> 00:42:59,909
   HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE
         THAT I DID."

749
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:04,347
AND IT'S KIND OF
            LIKE A SIGNAL TO ME

750
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,684
                      IN SOME--
       SOME STRANGE, SCARY WAY.

751
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:08,818
 NO, IT'S TRUE.

752
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,353
IT WAS KIND OF THE SAME
AS A CHILD.

753
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,688
IT WAS VERY VALIDATING.

754
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,700
    I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS
MY MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME.

755
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:26,936
  I JUST KNEW SOMETHING BAD
 WAS ALWAYS HAPPENING TO ME.

756
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,673
   AND I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T
  KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

757
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:32,709
  I'VE PRAYED MY WHOLE LIFE.
        I STILL PRAY.

758
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:34,978
  I'M A VERY SPIRITUAL PERSON.

759
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,714
           HOWEVER,
PRAYING NEVER MADE IT GO AWAY,

760
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:40,650
          EVEN WHEN
   I WAS WITHIN THE ATTACK.

761
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:45,722
I WOULD PRAY WITHIN THE ATTACK,
     AND STILL, NO HELP.

762
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:48,625
    I STARTED EXERCISING,
    STARTED EATING BETTER,

763
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,994
CUT BACK ON CAFFEINE AND DOING
   ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF,

764
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:54,831
      AND JUST NO MATTER
 WHAT I DID, THOUGH, IT WAS--

765
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,000
 IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT
   ON THE SLEEP PARALYSIS,

766
00:43:57,002 --> 00:44:00,236
  AND IT JUST KEPT HAPPENING
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.

767
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:03,006
      I FINALLY DECIDED
 TO GO TO ONE OF THESE LADIES

768
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:05,942
       THAT READ CARDS,
        AND SHE SAYS,

769
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,877
 "I CAN'T LOOK INTO YOUR HOUSE.

770
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,379
      I'M TRYING TO LOOK
       INTO YOUR HOUSE,

771
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:15,385
          BUT I SEE
 THIS BLACK SHADOW OVER IT."

772
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,220
<i> I THOUGHT</i>
  <i> I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS</i>

773
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:20,223
   <i> FOR A LONG TIME, YEARS,</i>
 <i> YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.</i>

774
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,692
    <i> BEFORE I WENT TO BED</i>
        <i> EVERY NIGHT,</i>

775
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:25,061
    <i> I WOULD LAY IN MY BED</i>
      <i> AND CLOSE MY EYES</i>

776
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,864
       <i> AND JUST PRAY,</i>
 <i> "NOT TONIGHT, NOT TONIGHT,</i>

777
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,266
  <i> NOT TONIGHT, NOT TONIGHT,</i>
 <i> NOT TONIGHT, NOT TONIGHT."</i>

778
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,669
<i>AND I WOULD JUST REPEAT IT OVER</i>
<i> AND OVER AND OVER IN MY HEAD,</i>

779
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,904
      <i> AS IF I HAD SOME</i>
    <i> KIND OF PSYCHIC BOND</i>

780
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:37,940
<i> WITH MY ALIEN ABDUCTORS</i>

781
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:41,744
<i> AND THAT I COULD COMMUNICATE</i>
  <i> WITH THEM TELEPATHICALLY,</i>

782
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:45,048
  <i> AND JUST PLEAD WITH THEM,</i>
<i> TO MAKE TONIGHT NOT THE NIGHT</i>

783
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,684
  <i> THAT THEY WOULD COME BACK</i>
     <i> AND DO THAT TO ME.</i>

784
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,155
<i> OVER THE YEARS,</i>
        <i> I WOULD FIND</i>

785
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:55,091
    <i> DIFFERENT MECHANISMS</i>
  <i> TO AVOID SLEEP PARALYSIS.</i>

786
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:59,762
 <i> I NOTICED THAT IT WOULDN'T</i>
     <i> HAPPEN EVERY NIGHT</i>

787
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,264
   <i> IF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS</i>
          <i> WERE MET,</i>

788
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:03,166
      <i> LIKE, IF I WOULD--</i>

789
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:05,802
 <i> LIKE, THERE WOULD BE, LIKE,</i>
      <i> A TV IN MY ROOM.</i>

790
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,271
    <i> AND IF I LEFT IT ON,</i>
       <i> FOR SOME REASON</i>

791
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:11,207
  <i> IT WAS EASIER FOR ME NOT</i>
<i> TO GET HIT BY THE PARALYSIS.</i>

792
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,077
        AND, YOU KNOW,
  YOUNGER ME THOUGHT IT WAS

793
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,912
      MAYBE THAT LITTLE
     HIGH-PITCHED NOISE,

794
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:17,780
           TVs MAKE
   WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM ON,

795
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,782
    SO I WOULD LEAVE IT ON
      OVERNIGHT ON MUTE

796
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,484
       FOR THAT LITTLE
     HIGH-PITCHED NOISE.

797
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:24,754
  <i> EVENTUALLY, THAT STOPPED</i>
 <i> WORKING AFTER ABOUT A YEAR.</i>

798
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:26,789
        <i> SO I DECIDED,</i>
    <i> LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT?</i>

799
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,492
      <i> IF ONE TV WORKED,</i>
      <i> WHAT ABOUT TWO?"</i>

800
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:34,497
 <i> AND I USED TO COLLECT JUNK,</i>
<i> SO TVs, LIKE, WERE PLENTIFUL.</i>

801
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:37,400
       <i> AND TWO WORKED</i>
     <i> FOR A LITTLE WHILE.</i>

802
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:41,070
    <i> AND I JUST ESCALATED</i>
   <i> WITH THAT FOR A WHILE,</i>

803
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:45,842
  <i> 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SMART,</i>
         <i> APPARENTLY.</i>

804
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:49,378
  <i> NO, IT MADE ME LOOK LIKE</i>
<i> A CRAZY PERSON UNTIL ONE DAY,</i>

805
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,749
       <i> I REALIZED THAT</i>
 <i> EVEN IF THIS WAS A PROBLEM,</i>

806
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:55,518
<i> THIS WAS NOT A FUNCTIONAL WAY</i>
 <i> OF, LIKE, DEALING WITH IT.</i>

807
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,055
SO I JUST REMOVED ALL THE TVs
 AT THAT POINT FROM MY ROOM,

808
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:02,425
  AND, YOU KNOW, ALL IT DID
         WAS LEAVE ME

809
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:06,095
WITH A MUCH STRONGER AND MORE
  ELABORATE SLEEP PARALYSIS.

810
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,498
 AND THAT'S KIND OF THE THING
      THAT I'VE REALIZED

811
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,300
  IS IF YOU HAVE IT EVERY DAY

812
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,770
AND YOU HAVE MULTIPLE EPISODES
            A DAY,

813
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,539
    IT WILL KIND OF LEARN
     HOW TO ADAPT TO YOU.

814
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:21,277
  LIKE, IF YOU TRY TO, LIKE,
 AVOID IT, IT WILL FIND YOU,

815
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,846
  AND IT WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN
           SOMEHOW.

816
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,836
       AND ANOTHER TIME,

817
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,972
      I ACTUALLY FELT IT
        GO ON THE BED.

818
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,808
    YOU KNOW, IT WAS AS IF
      IT'S CLIMBING UP.

819
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,877
     I WAS LAYING THERE,
      AND IT CAME HERE.

820
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:56,412
     I JUST CLOSED MY EYES.

821
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,898
   <i> AND IT WAS ON TOP OF ME,</i>

822
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,533
          AND IT WAS--

823
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,602
       IT'S LIKE I WAS
 HAVING SEX WITH THIS THING.

824
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:34,483
   AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD,
     THIS CAN'T BE REAL.

825
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,552
      THIS CAN'T BE REAL."

826
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:39,088
     THIS DEMONIC THING,
      AND I DON'T KNOW,

827
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,623
     WHY AM I FEELING THIS?

828
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,426
WHAT ELSE IS GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?
       BUT IT HAPPENED.

829
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:45,094
<i> DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?</i>

830
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:47,930
    I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
   IT WAS JUST THE FEELING.

831
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:49,632
  AND THEN IT WAS GONE AGAIN.

832
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,941
       A LOT OF FIRSTS
  ALL HAPPENED IN ONE NIGHT.

833
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,610
        WHEN THE PAIN
      STARTED HAPPENING,

834
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:02,178
      THE HALLUCINATIONS
       GOT MORE VIVID,

835
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,882
   AND I STARTED TO BE ABLE
    TO BE INTERACTED WITH.

836
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:14,290
 <i> AND I GO DIRECTLY INTO THIS</i>
<i> VERY, YOU KNOW, LUCID DREAM.</i>

837
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:18,361
 <i> I REMEMBER THE ARCHITECTURE</i>
       <i> OF THIS WORLD,</i>

838
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:22,164
       <i> OF THIS DREAM,</i>
  <i> IT WAS JUST VERY ANGULAR,</i>

839
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,599
        <i> AND I'M JUST</i>
   <i> KIND OF WALKING ON IT.</i>

840
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,105
  <i> THERE WERE, LIKE, STAIRS</i>
  <i> THAT WENT DOWN TO PLACES</i>

841
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:31,007
<i> THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT</i>
  <i> OUT A LITTLE BIT BETTER.</i>

842
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,385
   <i> AS I WAS WALKING AROUND,</i>

843
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:45,321
      <i> I REMEMBER A KID</i>
   <i> THAT I WAS FRIENDS WITH</i>

844
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,356
         <i> GROWING UP</i>
    <i> IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,</i>

845
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,058
       <i> MY ONLY FRIEND</i>
   <i> FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL</i>

846
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,294
       <i> COMES UP TO ME,</i>
   <i> AND HIS NAME WAS DANNY.</i>

847
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:56,198
       <i> AND BEHIND HIM</i>
    <i> IS THIS GIGANTIC DUDE</i>

848
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,336
      <i> WITH REALLY CRAZY</i>
        <i> ORANGE HAIR.</i>

849
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:04,407
<i> AND DANNY SAYS, "THIS IS HIM.</i>
       <i> CAN I GO NOW?"</i>

850
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,108
     <i> AND HE JUST LEAVES</i>
      <i> THE GUY WITH ME.</i>

851
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,683
       <i> AND HE REPEATS,</i>
    <i> "YOU KNOW WHO I AM."</i>

852
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:17,320
  <i> I START THINKING OF LIKE,</i>
 <i> I DON'T KNOW YOU, I DON'T.</i>

853
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:19,622
   <i> I START LISTING PLACES.</i>
 <i> "DO I KNOW YOU FROM SCHOOL?</i>

854
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:23,159
       <i> "DO I KNOW YOU</i>
      <i> FROM McDONALD'S?"</i>

855
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:25,061
    <i> 'CAUSE I USED TO WORK</i>
       <i> AT McDONALD'S.</i>

856
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,163
   <i> "DO I REMEMBER YOU FROM</i>
   <i> THE COMIC BOOK DEPOT?"</i>

857
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,231
<i> WHICH WAS MY COMIC BOOK STORE.</i>

858
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,667
  <i> AND HE JUST KEEPS ON GOING,</i>

859
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:36,339
<i> "NO. BUT YOU KNOW WHO I AM."</i>
       <i> ONE LAST TIME.</i>

860
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:39,041
  <i> AND THEN THE ENTIRE WORLD</i>
      <i> JUST DISAPPEARS,</i>

861
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:42,111
  <i> AND I'M IN THE STRONGEST</i>
   <i> SLEEP-PARALYSIS EPISODE</i>

862
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,245
   <i> I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.</i>

863
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:45,982
     <i> LIKE, I CANNOT MOVE.</i>

864
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,150
     <i> LIKE, I CAN'T EVEN</i>
<i> TRY TO FORCE MYSELF OUT OF IT.</i>

865
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,286
<i> LIKE, THAT LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM</i>
       <i> I GET SOMETIMES</i>

866
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,288
      <i> JUST WASN'T THERE.</i>

867
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,458
      <i> AND IT FELT LIKE</i>
<i> I WAS COMPLETELY CONSTRAINED,</i>

868
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,393
       <i> YOU KNOW, FULLY,</i>

869
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:59,662
     <i> TO THE POINT WHERE</i>
 <i> I'M JUST TRYING TO BREATHE,</i>

870
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,231
    <i> BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW</i>
      <i> WHAT ELSE TO DO.</i>

871
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:04,433
   <i> IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT</i>
        <i> DREAM DROPS,</i>

872
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:07,203
   <i> AND EVERYTHING'S GONE,</i>
  <i> HE KIND OF FIZZLES AWAY.</i>

873
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,710
   <i> AND THIS WAS THE FIRST</i>
    <i> EXPERIENCE WITH PAIN.</i>

874
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,212
   <i> IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE IT,</i>

875
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:18,481
        <i> PICTURE LIKE</i>
    <i> A CLAW-MACHINE GAME.</i>

876
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:22,051
      <i> YOU KNOW, THREE--</i>
    <i> THREE LITTLE THINGS.</i>

877
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,020
         AND THAT'S
WHEN THE PAIN STARTS COMING.

878
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,766
    THE WORST ONE IS WHEN
     IT'S AROUND, LIKE,

879
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:38,234
          YOU KNOW,
      MY FUCKING DICK.

880
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,816
  <i> AND I STILL FELT THE PAIN</i>
      <i> AFTER I WOKE UP.</i>

881
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,121
        <i> I DID NOT GO</i>
  <i> BACK TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT,</i>

882
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,823
         <i> I REMEMBER,</i>
  <i> AND I THINK I JUST PLAYED</i>

883
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,358
         <i> VIDEO GAMES</i>
      <i> UNTIL THE MORNING</i>

884
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,293
   <i> AND KIND OF QUESTIONED</i>
        <i> MY EXISTENCE.</i>

885
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,362
    <i> LIKE, I JUST REMEMBER</i>
         <i> BEING LIKE,</i>

886
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:09,298
 <i> "AND THIS IS DIFFERENT NOW,</i>
      <i> AND NOW IT HURTS,</i>

887
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,134
       <i> AND NOW THERE'S</i>
   <i> A DUDE TALKING TO ME."</i>

888
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:14,403
        <i> AND, LIKE, I--</i>

889
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,239
<i>THAT WAS KIND OF WHEN I STARTED</i>
   <i> TO FEEL A LITTLE CRAZY.</i>

890
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:20,476
<i> LIKE, I STARTED TO FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>SOMETHING WAS DEFINITELY WRONG.</i>

891
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:22,344
          WAS IT ME?
            MAYBE.

892
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,480
WAS IT SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL?
            MAYBE.

893
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:26,682
    I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED
      BEING AN ATHEIST.

894
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:35,257
        AND SOMETIMES
THEY'RE VERY, UM... ARTICULATE,

895
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,460
      LIKE THAT ONE WAS
   WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY,

896
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:39,395
     AND THEY'LL BE LIKE,
   "OH, I CAN TALK TO YOU,

897
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:42,231
    AND I KNOW YOUR NAME,"
      AND THIS AND THAT.

898
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:46,102
 AND SOMETIMES, THEY'RE JUST,
    LIKE, GOBBLEDYGOOKING,

899
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:47,870
   JUST, "BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,"

900
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,272
     LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE
THE CAPABILITY TO SPEAK ANYMORE.

901
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:53,409
    <i> WHEN I WAS OLDER AND</i>
  <i> I WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE</i>

902
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:55,111
    <i> AND WAS STAYING THERE--</i>

903
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:56,645
       <i> I MEAN, I HATED</i>
  <i> GOING BACK TO THAT HOUSE.</i>

904
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,681
    <i> YOU KNOW, I HAD OTHER</i>
   <i> BAD EXPERIENCES THERE,</i>

905
00:51:58,683 --> 00:52:02,151
AND SO I HATED GOING BACK THERE.
   I HATED SLEEPING THERE.

906
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:03,886
      I WOULD USUALLY--
IF I GO BACK THERE AND VISIT,

907
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:06,155
       <i> I LEAVE THE TV ON</i>

908
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:08,624
   <i> BECAUSE IT'S JUST SUCH</i>
   <i> AN OVERWHELMING FORCE.</i>

909
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,160
      SO I FELL ASLEEP,
  AND I HAD THIS NIGHTMARE.

910
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,562
      AND THEN I WOKE UP,

911
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,564
      AND THEN I WOKE UP
    IN A SLEEP PARALYSIS.

912
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,566
       <i> AND I WAS LIKE,</i>
    <i> "OH, HMM," YOU KNOW?</i>

913
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:19,535
    <i> BUT I WAS SO PUT OFF</i>
        <i> BY THE DREAM</i>

914
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,403
  <i> THAT I WASN'T IMMEDIATELY</i>
    <i> SHOCKED BY THE STATE</i>

915
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,306
     <i> OF SLEEP PARALYSIS,</i>
<i>WHICH NORMALLY IS WHAT IT DOES.</i>

916
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,242
  <i> AND I CAN KIND OF SEE IT</i>
<i> OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYES,</i>

917
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,576
    <i> THAT THERE WAS THIS MAN</i>

918
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,278
        <i> STANDING DOWN</i>
    <i> AT THE END OF MY BED,</i>

919
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,514
        <i> KIND OF LIKE</i>
   <i> THIS SCHLUMPY OLD MAN.</i>

920
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,486
       THAT'S TOO YOUNG
       FOR SOME REASON.

921
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,355
    MAYBE IT'S HIS POSTURE.

922
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:43,359
        AND I'M LIKE,
 "HUH," LIKE, "THAT'S WEIRD."

923
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:47,429
     <i> SO I'M LYING THERE,</i>
    <i> AND THERE'S THIS MAN</i>

924
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:51,300
 <i> DOWN AT THE END OF THE BED,</i>
     <i> AND HE SAYS TO ME,</i>

925
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,936
     <i> HE SAYS, "FORREST...</i>

926
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:57,473
   <i> YOU JUST CAME ALL OVER</i>
   <i> YOUR MOTHER'S SHEETS."</i>

927
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:01,577
YOU JUST MASTURBATED ALL OVER
  YOUR MOTHER'S BED SHEETS.

928
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:05,681
      YOU'RE DISGUSTING!
          A PERVERT.

929
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,285
  AND I HAD NOT MASTURBATED
   THAT NIGHT, I WILL SAY.

930
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:12,354
BUT HIS VOICE
  WAS IMMEDIATELY FAMILIAR.

931
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,957
  <i> AS THE VOICE THAT TALKED</i>
      <i> TO ME AS A CHILD.</i>

932
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:17,359
       <i> THE SAME VOICE.</i>
        <i> IT WAS LIKE--</i>

933
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,229
      IT WAS LIKE AS IF,
          YOU KNOW,

934
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:22,398
     YOU GET A PHONE CALL
       FROM A RELATIVE

935
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,300
   OR SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T
    TALKED TO IN A WHILE,

936
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:27,269
    RUN INTO AN OLD FRIEND
 AND HEAR THEIR VOICE FIRST,

937
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:28,971
  AND YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOICE.

938
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,906
     YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT
       FOR A LONG TIME.

939
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,575
      <i> BUT YOU KNOW IT.</i>
      <i> IT'S THAT PERSON.</i>

940
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:33,976
 <i> AND I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE,</i>
          <i> I'M LIKE,</i>

941
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:36,679
    <i> "OH, IT'S THAT VOICE.</i>
         <i> THAT MAN."</i>

942
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:39,949
<i> I'VE SEEN HIM</i>
   <i> TWO OR THREE MORE TIMES</i>

943
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:42,351
 <i> IN THAT PHYSICAL INCARNATION.</i>

944
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:47,489
  <i> BUT I'VE ALSO HAD, LIKE,</i>
<i> TIMES WHERE I'VE SEEN PEOPLE,</i>

945
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,425
   <i> THAT HAVE APPROACHED ME</i>
        <i> THE SAME WAY</i>

946
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:52,528
     <i> AND I'VE FELT LIKE,</i>
     <i> "YES, THAT'S HIM."</i>

947
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,930
          <i> LIKE, I--</i>
  <i> IT WAS A DIFFERENT BODY,</i>

948
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:58,601
 <i> BUT IT WAS THAT SAME ENTITY</i>
   <i> THAT WAS TALKING TO ME.</i>

949
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,504
 WE HAD A FRIEND STAYING OVER.

950
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:04,273
 WE HAD PEOPLE OVER THAT NIGHT,

951
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,242
   AND WE HAD A ONE-BEDROOM
       TINY APARTMENT.

952
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:09,645
         SO WE'RE ALL
 KIND OF CRAMMED INTO MY BED.

953
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,982
    AND I REMEMBER I HAD...

954
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,952
       UM, GONE TO SLEEP.

955
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:19,688
  <i> YOU KNOW, THE TWO GIRLS,</i>
      <i> THEY WERE ASLEEP.</i>

956
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,291
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>
 <i> THEY WERE OUT LIKE A LIGHT.</i>

957
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,693
     <i> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,</i>
     <i> THE PARALYSIS HITS.</i>

958
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,563
      <i> NORMAL PARALYSIS.</i>
     <i> COMPLETELY NORMAL.</i>

959
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:30,966
 <i> YOU KNOW, SITUATION, LIKE,</i>
  <i> STEREOTYPICAL DARK ROOM,</i>

960
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,536
        <i> BUT IN THIS,</i>
<i> THERE'S A REALLY TALL ENTITY,</i>

961
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:38,307
<i> LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF THE ROOM'S</i>
      <i> EIGHT FEET TALL,</i>

962
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:39,908
<i> HE IS AN EIGHT-FOOT-TALL DUDE</i>
        <i> WITH A HUNCH.</i>

963
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,645
   <i> LIKE, HE IS NOT FITTING</i>
        <i> IN THIS ROOM.</i>

964
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:46,048
   <i> AND THEY WERE RED EYES.</i>
  <i> THIS IS WHAT I REMEMBER.</i>

965
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,884
 <i> AND VERY MOTHMAN TYPE SHIT,</i>
          <i> ACTUALLY.</i>

966
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,552
 <i> AND IT STARTS TALKING TO ME.</i>

967
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:52,655
         <i> HE REPEATS,</i>
    <i> "YOU KNOW WHO I AM."</i>

968
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,456
<i> YOU KNOW WHO I AM.</i>

969
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,725
<i> YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.</i>

970
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,962
<i> RIGHT NOW,</i>
       <i> BUT I KNOW YOU.</i>

971
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:02,698
       <i> AND YOU KNOW ME.</i>

972
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:08,537
            YOU...
      ARE GOING TO DIE.

973
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:20,382
          I JUST HAD
  THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,

974
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,451
        YOU KNOW, AND,
   YOU KNOW, I BELIEVED IT.

975
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,053
  I BELIEVED THAT THIS THING
        WAS TELLING ME

976
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:25,587
     IT WAS GONNA KILL ME.

977
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,489
       I'M GOING TO DIE.

978
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,658
     AND I'M SITTING HERE
     FEELING BAD FOR HER

979
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,394
   THAT<i> SHE'S</i> FREAKING OUT,
AND I'M TRYING TO CALM HER DOWN.

980
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:34,430
 I FIGURE OUT SHE HAS THIS--
I FIGURED SHE HAD A SLEEP TERROR

981
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:36,932
   OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
     AND SHE'S TELLING ME

982
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,435
     <i> THAT ON HER CHEST,</i>
<i>SHE SAW SOMETHING ON HER CHEST,</i>

983
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:42,371
    <i> A CAT WITH RED EYES,</i>
  <i> AND IT WAS LOOKING AT ME</i>

984
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:45,708
  <i> AND TALKING IN A LANGUAGE</i>
<i> THAT SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.</i>

985
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:50,045
 <i> LIKE, IT WAS ON TOP OF HER</i>
     <i> BUT THREATENING ME.</i>

986
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,056
 <i> AND THE SECOND SHE SAID IT</i>
        <i> HAD RED EYES,</i>

987
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,625
  I JUST, LIKED, FREAKED OUT.

988
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:06,128
      LIKE, I WAS JUST--
          I, LIKE--

989
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,497
  I REMEMBER THIS WAS DURING
      A TIME OF MY LIFE

990
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,966
      WHERE I WAS LIKE,
"MAYBE I<i> AM</i> CRAZY. IT'S FINE."

991
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,735
    AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.

992
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:14,970
AND THEN IT IMMEDIATELY AFFIRMED
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE DEAD.

993
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:17,072
      LIKE, I WAS LIKE,
   "OH, I'M GOING TO DIE."

994
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:22,010
  AND, LIKE, SHIT LIKE THAT
     IMMEDIATELY MAKES ME

995
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:24,680
       WANT TO BE LIKE,
 "FUCK, LIKE, REGULAR LIFE."

996
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,115
            LIKE--
  SORRY ABOUT THE LANGUAGE.

997
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:27,950
 WHEN THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN,

998
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:30,586
        IT'S VERY HARD
      FOR ME TO BE LIKE,

999
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,654
   "YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA GO
       GET A NORMAL JOB

1000
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:34,390
   AND, LIKE, LIVE MY LIFE."

1001
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:36,058
       LIKE, I'M LIKE,
 "I WANT TO FIGURE THIS OUT."

1002
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,439
<i> ANY IDEA</i>
    <i> WHY IT HAPPENS TO YOU</i>

1003
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,474
    <i> MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE?</i>

1004
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,109
        I HAVE NO IDEA.

1005
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:58,480
  I MEAN, I GUESS, YOU KNOW,
    IT'S ALL PRESUMPTION,

1006
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:00,449
       <i> BUT, YOU KNOW,</i>
      <i> YOU COULD ASSUME</i>

1007
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:01,650
 <i> THAT MAYBE IT HAD SOMETHING</i>
            <i> TO DO</i>

1008
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:04,119
<i> WITH BEING SUCH A YOUNG CHILD,</i>

1009
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:07,489
    <i> YOU KNOW, AND HAVING</i>
 <i> SUCH A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE.</i>

1010
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:10,426
 <i> YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE</i>
   <i> WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING</i>

1011
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:12,161
     <i> FOR THE FIRST TIME,</i>
    <i> YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.</i>

1012
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:14,630
<i> YOU KNOW, YOU GO TO SEA WORLD</i>
   <i> AND SEE A KILLER WHALE,</i>

1013
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,598
         <i> AND YOU'VE</i>
    <i> NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE,</i>

1014
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,001
      <i> AND NOW YOU KNOW</i>
   <i> WHAT A KILLER WHALE IS.</i>

1015
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:23,605
<i> I READ THE VERY FEW</i>
<i> WEBSITES OUT THERE ABOUT IT,</i>

1016
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,909
  <i> AND I DIDN'T REALLY LEARN</i>
        <i> ANYTHING NEW,</i>

1017
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:29,745
         <i> EXCEPT FOR,</i>
    <i> THERE IS A CHEMICAL,</i>

1018
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:32,080
         <i> MELATONIN,</i>
 <i> THAT GOES INTO YOUR SYSTEM,</i>

1019
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:33,715
  <i> AND IS RELEASED UPON SLEEP</i>

1020
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,851
       <i> THAT'S SUPPOSED</i>
      <i> TO PARALYZE YOU.</i>

1021
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:39,087
   <i> AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,</i>
<i> MAYBE THIS</i> COULD<i> BE MEDICAL."</i>

1022
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,891
         <i> BUT AGAIN,</i>
<i> THERE WAS NEVER AN EXPLANATION</i>

1023
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:44,827
      <i> FOR THE SHADOW MAN</i>

1024
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:47,696
    <i> EXCEPT FOR HYPNAGOGIC</i>
       <i> HALLUCINATIONS,</i>

1025
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,064
     <i> WHICH IS A NICE WORD</i>

1026
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,933
      <i> THAT THE DOCTORS</i>
    <i> LIKE TO THROW AROUND,</i>

1027
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:53,001
     <i> BUT IT REALLY MEANS</i>
    <i> YOU JUST IMAGINED IT.</i>

1028
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:55,938
 MY GUESS IS WE CONCEPTUALIZE
  THINGS IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS,

1029
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,974
       BASED ON, LIKE,
   SNIPPETS OF INFORMATION

1030
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,976
      THAT WE PICKED UP
   ALONG THE ROAD SOMEHOW.

1031
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,512
        IF I CAME FROM
   AN EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY

1032
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,047
  WHERE THEY REALLY BELIEVED
       IN EVIL DEMONS,

1033
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:07,950
MAYBE MY IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION
     FROM MY UNCONSCIOUS

1034
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:09,751
 AS I'M RISING OUT OF SLEEP,
     WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE,

1035
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:11,653
  "OH, SHIT, IT'S THE DEVIL!"

1036
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,555
<i> YEAH, THAT'S INTERESTING.</i>

1037
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:16,058
<i> ALTHOUGH, I WONDER IF YOU LOOK</i>
    <i> AT YOUR OWN REACTION</i>

1038
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,560
            TO YOUR EXPERIENCES
           AS SIMILAR IN A WAY.

1039
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,929
YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
LIKE, THAT'S TRUE.

1040
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:23,632
OF COURSE. LIKE,
ALSO MY UNCONSCIOUS IS LIKE,

1041
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,667
"WHAT IS THE SCIENTIFIC
EXPLANATION FOR THIS?

1042
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,537
THERE MUST BE A REASON
THAT HAS TO DO WITH LOGIC."

1043
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,739
SO, YEAH, OF COURSE
I LEAPT FOR THAT, TOO.

1044
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,941
 I CAN SEE IT JUST AS EASILY
   THERE'S THE COMMONALITY

1045
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,944
  OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE, LIKE,
HOW OUR BRAINS AND OUR HEARTS

1046
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,680
AND OUR PERSONALITIES FUNCTION,
   LIKE, WE'RE ALL PEOPLE.

1047
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,015
     WHY WOULDN'T WE SEE
       SIMILAR THINGS?

1048
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,084
            LIKE,
 WE'RE NOT DIFFERENT SPECIES.

1049
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:44,887
 WHY WOULDN'T WE HAVE SIMILAR
GO-TO ARCHETYPES IN OUR BRAIN?

1050
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,588
          SO JUNGIAN.

1051
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,958
    BUT IT CAN'T ENTIRELY
      BE BORN FROM YOU.

1052
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,761
   YOU KNOW, THAT'S TO SAY
  THAT EVERYBODY HAS IN THEM

1053
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:55,831
THE CAPABILITY OF BRINGING OUT
    THESE HORRIBLE THINGS

1054
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,833
BEFORE THEY'VE EVEN WITNESSED
      ANYTHING HORRIBLE.

1055
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,038
    IT'S ONE OF MY THEORIES,

1056
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,575
     THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY
      RUNNING OUR BRAIN,

1057
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:08,977
<i> WE'RE KIND OF OVERCLOCKING IT,</i>
<i> YOU KNOW, MORE THAN WE WOULD</i>

1058
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:11,780
  <i> WHEN WE'RE JUST SLEEPING</i>
       <i> OR JUST AWAKE.</i>

1059
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:15,284
 <i> AND THAT KIND OF HEIGHTENED</i>
    <i> SENSE OF PERCEPTION,</i>

1060
00:59:15,286 --> 00:59:20,322
    WHILE WE AS HUMANS...
        CAN'T REALLY--

1061
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:22,090
     WE CAN'T INTERPRET IT.

1062
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:25,127
LIKE, WE'RE STILL NOT, YOU KNOW,
    INTERPRETING IT RIGHT,

1063
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:27,062
     BUT NOW WE'RE SEEING
        THE RAW DATA.

1064
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,831
   WE'RE SEEING, YOU KNOW,
 "OH, THAT COULD BE A DEMON."

1065
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,800
       I DON'T KNOW HOW
    TO VISUALIZE A DEMON,

1066
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:35,771
  BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A THING
 THAT MY BRAIN CAN INTERPRET.

1067
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:38,040
<i> AND, I MEAN,</i>
 <i> I ACTUALLY KIND OF BELIEVE</i>

1068
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:40,075
<i> THAT PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE</i>
       <i> WHO DO BELIEVE</i>

1069
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,045
<i> THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED,</i>
    <i> WERE ACTUALLY VICTIMS</i>

1070
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:45,714
     <i> OF SLEEP PARALYSIS</i>
     <i> OF VARYING DEGREES.</i>

1071
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,987
 <i> AND OF COURSE, READING MORE</i>
   <i> ABOUT SLEEP PARALYSIS,</i>

1072
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:54,756
<i> AND REALIZING THE PREVALENCE</i>
     <i> OF THIS EXPERIENCE,</i>

1073
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:58,927
  <i> YOU KNOW, EXISTS IN EVERY</i>
<i> SINGLE CULTURE IN THE WORLD.</i>

1074
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:04,032
    THERE ARE THESE COMMON
ARCHETYPES THAT KEEP POPPING UP,

1075
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,934
    AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.

1076
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,769
            <i> LIKE,</i>
  <i> IT'S NOT JUST IN AMERICA</i>

1077
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,738
         <i> PEOPLE GET</i>
   <i> THESE RED-EYED DEMONS.</i>

1078
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,074
       <i> AND IT'S NOT--</i>
<i> YOU KNOW, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.</i>

1079
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:14,142
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>
      <i> THE SHADOW MAN...</i>

1080
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,946
    <i> THE CATS ON THE CHEST.</i>

1081
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,386
<i> A GIANT CAT THAT WOULD</i>
 <i> COME INTO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE</i>

1082
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:26,088
  <i> WHILE THEY WERE SLEEPING,</i>
      <i> HOLD THEM DOWN--</i>

1083
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,657
     <i> IT'S LIKE CLAWED--</i>
    <i> LIKE TEETH AND CLAWS.</i>

1084
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,826
       <i> SOMETIMES METAL</i>
     <i> OR LIKE METAL-ISH.</i>

1085
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:32,661
  <i> YEAH, THERE ARE THE ONES</i>
         <i> IN TURKEY.</i>

1086
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:34,162
  <i> THERE'S THE ANCIENT MORSE--</i>

1087
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,865
   <i> THE ANCIENT NORSE ONE,</i>
       <i> LIKE, THE MARE.</i>

1088
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:40,736
 <i> AND THERE ARE JUST SO MANY.</i>
<i> THE HAINT, LIKE "THE HAUNT."</i>

1089
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,906
<i> THE HMONG IMMIGRANTS.</i>

1090
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:48,644
        <i> SUBSEQUENTLY,</i>
     <i> A LOT OF THEM DIED,</i>

1091
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:50,345
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>
    <i> FROM SLEEP PARALYSIS.</i>

1092
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:52,314
<i> RIGHT, RIGHT,</i>
    <i> AND I KNOW WES CRAVEN</i>

1093
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,082
  <i> READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT THEM,</i>

1094
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,151
        AND THAT HELPED INSPIRE
    "A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"

1095
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,253
     AND FREDDY KRUEGER, WHICH,
         YOU KNOW, THEN WENT ON

1096
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:00,122
          <i> TO CREATE</i>
   <i> A WEIRD FEEDBACK LOOP,</i>

1097
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:02,257
  <i> INSPIRING OTHER PEOPLE'S</i>
         <i> NIGHTMARES</i>

1098
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,927
     <i> AND SLEEP PARALYSIS</i>
        <i> EXPERIENCES.</i>

1099
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:11,133
<i> SO I HAD A DREAM</i>
    <i> ABOUT FREDDY KRUEGER,</i>

1100
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:13,135
   <i> AND HE OBVIOUSLY WANTED</i>
         <i> TO KILL ME,</i>

1101
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,836
      <i> WANTED TO HARM ME,</i>

1102
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,238
       <i> WANTED TO SCARE</i>
     <i> THE CRAP OUT OF ME,</i>

1103
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,108
        AND I BELIEVE
      THAT THAT FEAR...

1104
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,244
     <i> CREATES A SUBSTANCE,</i>

1105
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:26,882
  <i> AND I GOT THIS BLACK INK</i>
      <i> SCARED OUT OF ME,</i>

1106
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:29,084
       <i> LIKE AN INK FISH.</i>

1107
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:32,220
        <i> AND I BELIEVE</i>
    <i> THAT'S WHAT IT EATS.</i>

1108
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:35,891
<i> THE PHYSICIST</i>
    <i> MICHIO KAKU SAID THAT</i>

1109
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:38,226
  <i> MAYBE THAT WE DON'T LIVE</i>
   <i> IN JUST ONE DIMENSION,</i>

1110
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:40,896
        <i> THAT WE LIVE</i>
   <i> IN MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS.</i>

1111
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:43,799
     <i> AND IF YOU IMAGINE</i>
      <i> A BLOCK OF FLATS</i>

1112
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:47,069
<i> THAT AS AN INFINITE EXTENSION</i>
        <i> OF YOURSELF,</i>

1113
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,805
     <i> SO IT KEEPS ADDING</i>
   <i> TO ITSELF ALL THE TIME</i>

1114
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:52,040
      <i> AND NEVER STOPS,</i>
      <i> AND IN EVERY ROOM</i>

1115
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,943
    <i> OF THIS BLOCK OF FLATS,</i>

1116
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:57,979
    <i> IS AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE</i>
         <i> LIKE OURS.</i>

1117
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,915
            <i> NOW,</i>
    <i> IN EVERY OTHER ROOM,</i>

1118
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:03,285
        <i> THERE MUST BE</i>
      <i> ANOTHER UNIVERSE.</i>

1119
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:07,022
      <i> SO, IF THAT'S TRUE,</i>

1120
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:09,291
      <i> MAYBE SOME OTHER US</i>

1121
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:12,227
     <i> HAVE FOUND OUR WAY</i>
      <i> INTO THE HALLWAY,</i>

1122
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,162
      <i> AND ARE KNOCKING</i>
        <i> ON OUR DOOR.</i>

1123
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,247
<i> READY, TWO.</i>

1124
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,760
   RIGHT AFTER MY MOM DIED,
    I WAS VERY DEPRESSED.

1125
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,528
     AND SO I'D BE CRYING.

1126
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,064
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS THIS ONE DAY
          I REMEMBER

1127
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:53,201
   THAT I HAD A BREAKDOWN,
AND I WAS CRYING A LOT, A LOT.

1128
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:55,804
    AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
  SINCE I WORK NIGHT SHIFT,

1129
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:58,039
     I CAME HOME, SLEPT--
     YOU KNOW, TO SLEEP.

1130
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:01,176
  <i> AND THEN FOR SOME REASON</i>
          <i> THAT DAY,</i>

1131
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:03,178
 <i> I WANTED TO SLEEP ON MY SIDE.</i>

1132
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:07,282
    <i> SO I SLEPT ON MY SIDE</i>
<i>FACING THE DOOR OF THE BEDROOM.</i>

1133
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:12,554
    <i> AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,</i>
<i> I FELT MY BODY GETTING NUMB.</i>

1134
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:14,856
 <i> I FELT IT GETTING PARALYZED.</i>

1135
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:17,526
  <i> AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD.</i>
  <i> I'M GETTING THIS AGAIN."</i>

1136
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:20,228
  <i> BUT THEN IT FELT DIFFERENT.</i>

1137
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,097
   <i> I HEARD SOMEBODY WALKING.</i>

1138
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,195
   THIS PRESENCE CAME AROUND.

1139
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:56,264
    AND IT CAME BEHIND ME.
       I WAS LIKE THIS.

1140
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:59,201
      IT CAME BEHIND ME,
      AND IT HUGGED ME.

1141
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:02,137
  <i> AND I HEARD THE MATTRESS</i>
        <i> DEPRESS ALSO.</i>

1142
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:05,373
    I HEARD THAT DEPRESS,
LIKE SOMEONE WENT IN THE BED.

1143
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,543
<i> AND I FELT IT WAS MY MOTHER,</i>
   <i> AND I HEARD HER VOICE,</i>

1144
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,246
        <i> AND SHE SAYS,</i>
<i> "HONEY, I'M HERE. I'M HERE."</i>

1145
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:16,017
   AND IT FELT SO DIFFERENT
   FROM THAT PAST PRESENCE,

1146
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,153
      BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
     THIS WAS MY MOTHER.

1147
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:19,988
      IT DIDN'T FEEL EVIL.

1148
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,090
        IT FELT WARM,
       AND I WAS HAPPY.

1149
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:24,326
    AND I WOULD TALK TO HER.

1150
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:26,228
         IT'S LIKE--
   THROUGH MY MIND I SAID,

1151
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,330
    "OH, MOMMY, IT'S YOU.
         OH, MY GOD."

1152
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:33,101
  AND SHE'S HUGGING ME TIGHT
SAYING, "I'M HERE, I'M HERE."

1153
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,936
      AND THAT WAS JUST
     A MATTER OF SECONDS,

1154
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:36,905
       ALL OF A SUDDEN,
        SHE WAS GONE.

1155
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:38,573
        SO I REALLY--
          YOU KNOW,

1156
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:42,611
     I THINK IT'S MY MOM
   THAT COMES TO VISIT US.

1157
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:45,313
<i> DOES THAT STILL HAPPEN?</i>

1158
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:48,984
<i> IT HAPPENED, LIKE,</i>
     <i> TWO OR THREE TIMES.</i>

1159
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:51,586
     BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
       I FEEL IT'S HER,

1160
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:55,090
     THERE'S A PART OF ME
     THAT SOMETIMES SAYS,

1161
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:56,925
   "WHAT IF IT'S THIS THING?"

1162
01:04:56,927 --> 01:05:00,896
      <i> BECAUSE SOMETIMES</i>
    <i> WHEN I HAVE FELT HER,</i>

1163
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:03,198
      <i> ALL OF A SUDDEN,</i>
  <i> THEN IT KIND OF SWITCHES,</i>

1164
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,601
  <i> AND THEN I DO FEEL, LIKE,</i>
<i> IF THERE'S ANOTHER PRESENCE.</i>

1165
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:09,204
    <i> AND THEN I DON'T KNOW</i>
  <i> IF IT'S THIS THING AGAIN</i>

1166
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,907
    <i> THAT USED TO HAUNT ME</i>
          <i> BACK THEN</i>

1167
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,943
 <i> OR IF IT IS STILL HER EVEN</i>
<i> THOUGH IT DOES FEEL DIFFERENT.</i>

1168
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:16,611
  <i> I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE</i>
      <i> IN BOTH OF THEM,</i>

1169
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,947
      <i> AND I HAVE SAID,</i>
       <i> "WHO ARE YOU?"</i>

1170
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,615
       <i> BUT OF COURSE,</i>
   <i> I DON'T GET AN ANSWER.</i>

1171
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,617
   <i> AND THEN IT JUST LASTS</i>
     <i> FOR A FEW SECONDS,</i>

1172
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,552
        <i> AND IT'S GONE.</i>

1173
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,231
   THE ONE THAT STANDS OUT
      ABOVE ALL OTHERS,

1174
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:37,966
     IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT

1175
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:40,035
  WHEN ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND
         WENT TO BED,

1176
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:43,672
   AND IT WAS AROUND 10:00,
  AND I WASN'T REALLY TIRED.

1177
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:46,975
   <i> SO I PLAYED ON MY PHONE</i>
         <i> FOR A BIT,</i>

1178
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:48,677
     <i> A GAME ON THE PHONE,</i>

1179
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:51,112
<i> AND I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP.</i>

1180
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,523
       <i> WHEN I WOKE UP,</i>
<i> I STOOD AT THE SIDE OF MY BED,</i>

1181
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:04,426
     IN A VERY OPPRESSIVE
         ATMOSPHERE.

1182
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:06,394
       I CAN'T DESCRIBE
    THE ATMOSPHERE TO YOU,

1183
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:08,330
     UNLESS YOU WERE THERE.

1184
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:10,465
      I MEAN, I'VE NEVER
    EXPERIENCED IT BEFORE

1185
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,001
AND I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED IT
       AGAIN LIKE THAT.

1186
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:17,539
        IT'S A KIND OF
      A VERY STATICKY...

1187
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:20,375
   UH, JUST PRESENCE OF EVIL.

1188
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:23,011
  AND AS I TURNED TO MY LEFT,

1189
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:28,083
 <i> I SEE MY GIRLFRIEND IN BED,</i>
    <i> AND I SEE ME IN BED.</i>

1190
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:31,486
    <i> AND NOW I'M CONFUSED,</i>
<i> BUT I ALSO SEE MY EYES OPEN,</i>

1191
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:35,023
   <i> AND THEN I HEARD MYSELF</i>
     <i> LABORED BREATHING,</i>

1192
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:37,459
<i> WHICH IS WHAT I DO WHEN I HAVE</i>
  <i> A SLEEP PARALYSIS ATTACK.</i>

1193
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:42,263
  I'M SHOCKED, SCARED, AND...

1194
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:45,300
        I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

1195
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:47,335
         I'M CONFUSED
     MORE THAN ANYTHING.

1196
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,137
          I CAN'T--
   I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.

1197
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:50,638
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

1198
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,576
    AND ALMOST INSTANTLY,
    AS I'M THINKING THAT,

1199
01:06:54,578 --> 01:06:58,146
    I CAN SEE THREE BEINGS
OVER IN THIS CORNER OF THE ROOM.

1200
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,221
          THERE'S NO
    LOOKING ME UP AND DOWN

1201
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:09,157
     AND SEEING WHO I AM
  AND WHAT I'M DOING THERE.

1202
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:12,260
           <i> THEY--</i>
<i> THE TWO GENERIC SHADOW PEOPLE,</i>

1203
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,095
     <i> THEY ADVANCE ON ME</i>
        <i> STRAIGHTAWAY.</i>

1204
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:20,101
       A GRAPPLE ENSUED
     BETWEEN ME AND THEM.

1205
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,344
       I'D LIKE TO SAY
    IT WAS A NOBLE FIGHT,

1206
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:32,414
     THAT I HAD TO REALLY
  PUT MY FOOT DOWN AND WIN,

1207
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:34,182
         BUT IT WASN'T.

1208
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:37,419
     <i> THEY JUST RETREATED</i>
        <i> STRAIGHTAWAY</i>

1209
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:40,488
  <i> WHEN I PUT RESISTANCE UP</i>
     <i> BEHIND THE HAT MAN.</i>

1210
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,590
 AND THE HAT MAN SHIELDED THEM.

1211
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:46,161
   <i> AND I HAD NO INTENTION</i>
      <i> OF GOING FORWARD</i>

1212
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:47,595
   <i> TO INVESTIGATE ANY MORE.</i>

1213
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:50,498
      ALL I KNOW IS THAT
  I HAVE TO GET BACK IN BED,

1214
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,402
     THAT SOME SORT OF--
 SOME VOICE IN MY HEAD SAYING

1215
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:57,105
   AND MY OWN VOICE SAYING,
      "GET BACK IN BED."

1216
01:07:57,107 --> 01:08:01,109
       AND AS I TURNED,
I CAN SEE A LONG SILVER THREAD,

1217
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:05,480
 <i> FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD,</i>
<i> THAT'S GOING TOWARDS MY BODY.</i>

1218
01:08:05,482 --> 01:08:09,784
 AND I DECIDE THAT NOW I HAVE
   GOTTA GET BACK INTO BED.

1219
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:13,154
 <i> AND JUST AS I DECIDE THAT,</i>
     <i> I SHOOT UP IN BED.</i>

1220
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:16,391
    <i> THERE'S NO IN BETWEEN,</i>

1221
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,259
    <i> GOING BACK IN MY BODY</i>
        <i> OR WHATEVER.</i>

1222
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,861
     <i> IT'S JUST I'M THERE.</i>

1223
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,530
      I SIT STRAIGHT UP,
     AND I GO DOWNSTAIRS

1224
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:24,299
      INTO THE KITCHEN,
         GET A DRINK,

1225
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:27,335
    AND I'M INSTANTLY HIT
    BY THE FEAR AND GUILT,

1226
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,537
      THAT I'VE LEFT HER
     ON HER OWN UPSTAIRS.

1227
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,272
    BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL
        IN THAT ROOM.

1228
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,807
     I KNOW THEY'RE STILL
         IN THAT ROOM.

1229
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:36,244
  AND AS I GO BACK UPSTAIRS,
        I SIT IN BED,

1230
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:37,846
    AND I STAY UP ALL NIGHT.

1231
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:40,215
  <i> AND IT'S LIKE I'M ON WATCH.</i>

1232
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,177
<i>THEY JUST WANTED ME REALLY BAD.</i>

1233
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,549
    <i> I REMEMBER I WAS JUST</i>
  <i> SORT OF LAYING IN MY BED,</i>

1234
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:18,286
    <i> AND THEN THERE'S NOW</i>
       <i> THE LOUD NOISE,</i>

1235
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:20,588
  AND, OH, I HATE THE SOUND
        OF THE NOISE.

1236
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,525
   IT'S, LIKE, ALMOST LIKE
      SPIRITS OR DEMONS,

1237
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,460
      LIKE, KIND OF LIKE
      SCREAMING AT YOU.

1238
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:28,196
- - SO THEN YOU HEAR, LIKE--

1239
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:30,832
       IT'S ALMOST LIKE
    A BUZZING THAT STARTS,

1240
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:33,935
     AND THEN I CAN SENSE
         A PRESENCE,

1241
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:36,471
           RIGHT--
   LIKE, STANDING OVER ME.

1242
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,374
   JUST STANDING RIGHT HERE
          NEXT TO ME

1243
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,543
          ON MY BED
      STANDING OVER ME.

1244
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,213
     THEN YOU HEAR, LIKE,
         THIS SOUND.

1245
01:09:45,215 --> 01:09:46,614
         IT'S LIKE--
        IT FEELS LIKE

1246
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:49,484
     SOMEBODY'S SCREAMING
      RIGHT IN YOUR EAR,

1247
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:52,287
   LIKE THEY'RE RIGHT HERE,
    AND THEY'RE SCREAMING.

1248
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:08,603
 AND I CAN SENSE THE COLOR RED,

1249
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:12,307
   AS IF THEY WERE WEARING
        SOMETHING RED

1250
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:16,911
   OR LIKE A DARK RED ROBE
      OR SOMETHING RED.

1251
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:20,949
AND I TRIED TO LOOK AT THE FACE,
       BUT I COULDN'T.

1252
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:23,918
      LIKE, EVERY INCH,
       EVERY CENTIMETER

1253
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,955
     FEELS LIKE OVER A TON.

1254
01:10:26,957 --> 01:10:30,425
 <i> AND SO I'M TRYING TO MOVE,</i>
     <i> AND I WANNA SEE IT,</i>

1255
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:32,393
      <i> AND I'M LOOKING,</i>
 <i> LIKE STRAINING TO LOOK UP,</i>

1256
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,262
     <i> STRAINING TO LOOK UP.</i>

1257
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:36,631
          <i> I COULD--</i>
<i> I COULD BARELY MOVE MY HEAD.</i>

1258
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:40,568
IT WAS ALMOST GOING LIKE THIS,
            LIKE--

1259
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:45,373
       AND THEN, LIKE,
  I THINK I SAID SOMETHING.

1260
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,008
         I JUST SAID,
    "I REMEMBER THIS GUY.

1261
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,543
       HIS NAME IS JESUS,

1262
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:50,478
  AND I'M GONNA USE HIS NAME
          RIGHT NOW.

1263
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,380
      AND I'M GONNA SAY,
       'IN JESUS' NAME,

1264
01:10:52,382 --> 01:10:56,451
  YOU KNOW, GET OUT,'" OR--
I SAID SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.

1265
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,353
            JESUS...

1266
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,425
            JESUS...

1267
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:09,697
       IN JESUS' NAME....

1268
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:14,869
      IN JESUS' NAME...
           GET OUT.

1269
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:22,410
    AND I SUDDENLY SENSED
       THAT THE DEMONS,

1270
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:24,712
         OR THE THING
  THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME,

1271
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:29,317
      THAT EVIL PRESENCE
       JUST LEFT. GONE.

1272
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:31,452
      AND IT WAS AMAZING.

1273
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,822
    IT WAS LIKE A FEELING
      OF VICTORY, YEAH.

1274
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:36,958
<i> AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK?</i>

1275
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,361
    THEY NEVER CAME BACK.
I WASN'T EVEN A CHRISTIAN THEN.

1276
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:42,730
 I ACTUALLY ABHORRED RELIGION.

1277
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:44,565
        I DIDN'T WANT--

1278
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,601
    SOME LADY A LONG TIME
         AGO TOLD ME

1279
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:49,337
I SHOULD MARRY A CHRISTIAN MAN,
AND I JUST LAUGHED IN HER FACE.

1280
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:52,940
      ANYWAYS, I LEARNED
     VERY LATE IN MY LIFE

1281
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,842
    THAT THE NAME OF JESUS
          HAS POWER,

1282
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:58,546
        AND THAT'S HOW
    I BECAME A CHRISTIAN.

1283
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:02,717
<i> SO DO YOU NOT--</i>

1284
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,354
      <i> DO YOU BELIEVE IN</i>
  <i> THE WIKIPEDIA DEFINITION</i>

1285
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:08,656
      <i> OF SLEEP PARALYSIS?</i>

1286
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:09,924
              NO.

1287
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:13,928
      UM, THAT WOULD BE
      SORT OF LIKE THE--

1288
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:17,799
        I GUESS, THE--
      THE WORLDLY TERM,

1289
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:19,901
 LIKE, WHAT PEOPLE WOULD DEEM
         AS SOMETHING

1290
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:23,404
THAT'S A PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE,

1291
01:12:23,406 --> 01:12:25,540
THAT IT'S LIKE A NATURAL THING
 THAT HAPPENS WITH THE BODY.

1292
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:28,910
 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

1293
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:32,347
          I DO THINK
  THAT IT'S SOMETHING TO DO

1294
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:34,916
   WITH THE SPIRITUAL REALM.

1295
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:39,787
    AND IT'S CLOSELY TIED
WITH POSSIBLY DEMONIC ACTIVITY.

1296
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,689
        AT 33 YEARS OLD,

1297
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,758
 I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA GET
      ANY BETTER FOR ME.

1298
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,493
     I'VE EXPERIENCED IT
       MOST OF MY LIFE,

1299
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:46,594
      IF NOT ALL MY LIFE.

1300
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,429
     I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

1301
01:12:48,431 --> 01:12:51,766
    <i> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT</i>
<i>THIS IS JUST A RARE OCCURRENCE.</i>

1302
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:55,470
       <i> I THINK IT'S--</i>
<i> I THINK NONE OF US ARE SPECIAL</i>

1303
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,705
<i> THAT HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO THEM.</i>

1304
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,843
<i>THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD</i>
<i> HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO US, SO--</i>

1305
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:05,446
    <i> BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW</i>
    <i> HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE</i>

1306
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:08,850
  <i> OUT THERE EXPERIENCE THIS.</i>

1307
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,685
 <i> I KNOW THERE ARE QUITE A FEW,</i>

1308
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:13,454
         <i> BUT I THINK</i>
     <i> THERE'S A LOT MORE.</i>

1309
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:25,166
       <i> HEY, EVERYBODY,</i>
      <i> IT'S CONNIE HERE,</i>

01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:44,652

    <i> ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE.</i>

1318
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,423
        <i> DO YOU WATCH</i>
   <i> A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S</i>

1319
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,758
    <i> SLEEP PARALYSIS VIDEOS?</i>

1320
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,563
<i> I DON'T REALLY</i>
      <i> LIKE TO LISTEN--</i>

1321
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:57,532
     I HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT
      OF OTHER PEOPLE'S

1322
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:59,667
    SLEEP PARALYSIS VIDEOS.

1323
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:02,703
       ALTHOUGH PEOPLE
   DO SEND ME THEIR STUFF,

1324
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:04,505
    I JUST AM NOT IN A PLACE

1325
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:08,810
      TO WANT TO LISTEN
TO THAT KIND OF STUFF ANYMORE.

1326
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:09,944
       I DON'T KNOW WHY.

1327
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,813
    I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST--

1328
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:16,684
   IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT'S
          THE PAST,

1329
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:18,786
  AND I'M NOT IN THAT SPACE
           ANYMORE.

1330
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,756
   YOU KNOW, I FOUND FAITH,
    AND I MET MY HUSBAND,

1331
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:25,693
     AND I NEVER THOUGHT
   I'D GET MARRIED, AND...

1332
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:28,629
<i> SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY</i>
<i> TRYING NOT TO THINK TOO MUCH</i>

1333
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,031
<i> ABOUT SLEEP PARALYSIS ANYMORE.</i>

1334
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:34,535
   YEAH, YEAH, I MEAN, WHY?
     FOR WHAT, YOU KNOW?

1335
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,794
             UM...

1336
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:01,963
          I WAS, UH...

1337
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:03,931
        DATING A GIRL
    WHO WAS PRETTY CRAZY.

1338
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:06,567
 SHE WAS KIND OF REALLY INTO
     BEING VERY NATURE-Y.

1339
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:08,002
      NOT LIKE A HIPPIE,
       BUT KIND OF LIKE

1340
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:12,673
  A CRAZY WOOD SPIRIT NYMPH
    WAS KIND OF HER VIBE.

1341
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,943
     A LOT OF HER CLOTHES
WERE, LIKE, STITCHED TOGETHER.

1342
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:17,845
SHE WAS CRAZY.

1343
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:21,282
  SHE WOULD DO THINGS LIKE,
    SAY, START WALKING OUT

1344
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:23,084
        <i> IN THE MIDDLE</i>
<i> OF AN INCREDIBLY BUSY STREET,</i>

1345
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,819
<i> AND I WOULD TRY AND STOP HER,</i>
     <i> AND SHE'D BE LIKE,</i>

1346
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,754
          <i> "NO, NO,</i>
<i> THE SPIRITS ARE GUIDING ME,"</i>

1347
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:28,990
<i> WITH HER EYES CLOSED.</i>

1348
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:31,893
 <i> I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE SURVIVED.</i>

1349
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:35,563
    SO SHE WAS DEFINITELY
  ON THE CUSP OF SOMETHING.

1350
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:37,031
           <i> SO WAS I.</i>

1351
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,000
 <i> WE WERE BOTH REALLY LIVING</i>
       <i> IN THE FRINGES</i>

1352
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:42,036
    <i> OF SANITY AT THAT TIME.</i>

1353
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:45,973
   <i> AND WE WENT UP TO A CABIN</i>

1354
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:50,778
       <i> THAT MY DAD HAS</i>
<i> IN THE BAY OF FUNDY IN CANADA.</i>

1355
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:54,048
   <i> AND WE WERE WALKING OUT</i>
        <i> IN THE WOODS.</i>

1356
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,984
  <i> AND IT WAS GETTING DARK.</i>
    <i> IT WAS KIND OF DUSK.</i>

1357
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:59,987
        <i> SO SHE SAID,</i>
<i> "LET'S BUILD A STONE CIRCLE",</i>

1358
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,856
   <i> BECAUSE WE'D JUST GONE</i>
     <i> TO A PEBBLE BEACH.</i>

1359
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:04,959
   <i> SO WE TOOK OUR PEBBLES</i>
   <i> AND LAID THEM ALL DOWN.</i>

1360
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:07,662
     <i> AND THEN WE DECIDED</i>
      <i> TO BE RECEPTIVE,</i>

1361
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:09,030
 <i> IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.</i>

1362
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,704
      <i> AND SO SHE, LIKE,</i>
       <i> CLOSED HER EYES</i>

1363
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:18,739
     <i> AND SHE WAS, LIKE,</i>
     <i> STANDING LIKE THIS,</i>

1364
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:21,742
   <i> AND I WAS JUST KIND OF</i>
  <i> STANDING THERE LIKE THIS.</i>

1365
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:26,013
   -<i> AND SUDDENLY SHE GOES,</i>
 <i> "OH, SOMETHING'S COMING." </i>
 - SHE'S COMING! SHE'S COMING!

1366
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:27,882
 <i> AND SHE HAD HER EYES CLOSED,</i>

1367
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:30,985
    <i> AND SO SHE WAS NOT--</i>
   <i> COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING,</i>

1368
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:32,653
     <i> AND I WAS LOOKING,</i>
       <i> AND IT WAS LIKE</i>

1369
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:35,022
      <i> SHE WAS LISTENING</i>
     <i> AND I WAS LOOKING.</i>

1370
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:38,326
<i> AND I LOOKED INTO THE FOREST,</i>
         <i> AND, UM...</i>

1371
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:44,098
   <i> OUT CAME THIS BLUE FORM.</i>

1372
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,602
   <i> IT STARTED APPROACHING,</i>
 <i> THIS VERY, VERY BLUE THING.</i>

1373
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:50,104
<i> LIKE, IT HAD THE SAME QUALITY</i>
     <i> AS THE BLACK THINGS</i>

1374
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,907
    <i> THAT WE TALKED ABOUT,</i>
     <i> BUT BLUE, PEACEFUL,</i>

1375
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:54,842
   <i> JUST REALLY, LIKE, NICE.</i>

1376
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:57,111
       <i> AND SHE'S LIKE,</i>
      <i> "OH, SHE'S BLUE."</i>

1377
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,779
    <i> SHE SAID, "SHE'S BLUE."</i>

1378
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,115
        <i> EYES CLOSED,</i>
    <i> YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.</i>

1379
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,817
  <i> AND IT CAME AND APPROACHED,</i>

1380
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:04,819
      <i> AND THEN IT JUST</i>
    <i> KIND OF STOOD STILL,</i>

1381
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:07,021
   <i> AND IT WAS MAYBE, LIKE,</i>
    <i> SIX FEET OVER THERE.</i>

1382
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:09,624
   <i> I'M GETTING GOOSEBUMPS</i>
  <i> JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS.</i>

1383
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:12,393
  <i> AND HERE'S MY GIRLFRIEND,</i>
<i> AND SHE'S JUST LAUGHING A LOT,</i>

1384
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:14,662
   <i> LIKE, "OH, SHE'S SAYING</i>
    <i> THE FUNNIEST THINGS."</i>

1385
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:16,697
      <i> LIKE, JUST CRAZY.</i>
<i> IT WAS REALLY CRAZY AND WEIRD.</i>

1386
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,642
      <i> AND SHE GOES, "OH,</i>

1387
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:30,911
SHE SAYS NOT TO BE WORRIED
ABOUT THE DEMONS BEHIND YOU."

1388
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:33,080
    <i> AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"</i>

1389
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:35,383
      AND I TURNED AROUND.

1390
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,021
        <i> AND I SAW THEM.</i>

1391
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,797
       <i> THAT SAME FACE.</i>
  <i> THE FACE THAT PEOPLE SEE</i>

1392
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:51,732
    <i> WHEN THEY'RE ABDUCTED</i>
         <i> BY ALIENS.</i>

1393
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:54,368
     <i> THE FACE THAT I SAW</i>
      <i> AS A SMALL CHILD.</i>

1394
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:00,374
   <i> AND THEN IN THAT MOMENT,</i>

1395
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:05,680
 <i> I SUDDENLY HAD THIS, LIKE,</i>
    <i> KIND OF REALIZATION.</i>

1396
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,352
   <i> 'CAUSE IT WASN'T, LIKE,</i>
         <i> LINGUISTIC.</i>

1397
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:13,120
    <i> I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY</i>
       <i> TALKING TO ME,</i>

1398
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,389
    <i> BUT I FELT A THOUGHT</i>
         <i> IN MY HEAD,</i>

1399
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:18,025
     <i> SOMETHING EXTERNAL,</i>
<i>AND IT WAS ALL ABOUT HOW, UM...</i>

1400
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,763
   <i> FEAR EMPOWERS BAD THINGS.</i>

1401
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,803
      <i> TO HAVE FEAR WHEN</i>
 <i> YOU'RE IN A BAD ENVIRONMENT</i>

1402
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:30,771
       <i> OR A BAD PLACE</i>
    <i> OR AROUND A BAD THING</i>

1403
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:33,474
    <i> ONLY GIVES THAT THING</i>
       <i> MORE STRENGTH.</i>

1404
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,916
  <i> WHAT THAT KIND OF MADE ME</i>
      <i> BEGIN TO REALIZE</i>

1405
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:44,051
     <i> IS THAT, YOU KNOW,</i>
<i> HERE I'M HEARING THESE VOICES,</i>

1406
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,420
  <i> AND THEY'RE DISEMBODIED,</i>
          <i> CONFUSED,</i>

1407
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:49,390
    <i> SCHIZOPHRENIC GHOSTS,</i>
          <i> YOU KNOW,</i>

1408
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,492
    <i> YEAH, THOSE ARE PEOPLE.</i>

1409
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:53,094
     <i> MAYBE THEY'RE DEAD.</i>
    <i> MAYBE THEY'RE ALIVE.</i>

1410
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:55,062
         <i> I DON'T KNOW.</i>

1411
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,897
  <i> BUT THEN THE OTHER THINGS,</i>

1412
01:18:56,899 --> 01:19:00,501
  <i> THE BLACK, CLOUDY THING,</i>
     <i> THESE GRAY THINGS,</i>

1413
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:05,873
   <i> UM, THOSE ARE SOMETHING</i>
        <i> MORE PRIMAL,</i>

1414
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:09,777
     <i> SOMETHING MORE JUST</i>
       <i> ENVIRONMENTAL.</i>

1415
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:11,779
       <i> AND WHEN I CAME</i>
<i> TO THAT REALIZATION, I'M LIKE,</i>

1416
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:13,781
        <i> WELL, DOES IT</i>
  <i> HAVE TO BE ANY ONE THING?</i>

1417
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:18,786
   AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER,
       THE BLUE SPIRIT,

1418
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:22,323
             UH,
  DISSIPATED INTO THE WOODS.

1419
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:26,093
  AND THEN WE WENT BACK TO,
     YOU KNOW, THE CABIN,

1420
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,796
       AND THAT WAS THAT.

1421
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:30,865
<i> YOU'RE TALKING</i>
<i> ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS</i>

1422
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:33,000
    <i> AT THE ABSOLUTE EDGES</i>
        <i> OF DREAMING.</i>

1423
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:34,368
            LIKE,
  YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN DREAMS.

1424
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,537
    YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THEM
          LOGICALLY.

1425
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:38,005
   THEY'RE ALL LITTLE BITS
          AND PIECES

1426
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,340
      THAT COME UP FROM
    YOUR UNCONSCIOUSNESS,

1427
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:41,242
       AND FROM THINGS
     YOU'VE EXPERIENCED,

1428
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:44,145
AND WHO KNOWS HOW THE SLEEPING
  MIND PUTS THINGS TOGETHER?

1429
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:45,780
    AND NOW YOU'RE TALKING
     ABOUT AN EXPERIENCE

1430
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:47,081
         THAT HAPPENS
  IN THAT IN-BETWEEN STAGE.

1431
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,816
        IT'S SO LIMINAL.

1432
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:52,853
     YOU CAN'T PUT LOGIC
   ONTO LIMINAL SITUATIONS.

1433
01:19:52,855 --> 01:19:55,356
          I NEED YOU
      TO ALSO UNDERSTAND

1434
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:57,925
         THAT I WAS IN
     AN ABUSIVE HOUSEHOLD.

1435
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:01,195
   <i> I BELIEVE BECAUSE I WAS</i>
<i> BEATEN SO MUCH DURING THE DAY,</i>

1436
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:04,865
       <i> THAT AT NIGHT,</i>
     <i> MY SOUL HAD TO HEAL</i>

1437
01:20:04,867 --> 01:20:06,867
       <i> TO KEEP ME HERE.</i>

1438
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:09,270
<i>THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GET THROUGH</i>
    <i> THE FOURTH DIMENSION,</i>

1439
01:20:09,272 --> 01:20:13,007
 <i> AND THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GO</i>
<i> SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BE HEALED,</i>

1440
01:20:13,009 --> 01:20:16,377
  <i> SO THAT I COULD COME BACK</i>
   <i> AND DEAL WITH MY LIFE.</i>

1441
01:20:16,379 --> 01:20:18,946
  I KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
    ABOUT SLEEP PARALYSIS

1442
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:21,348
   UNTIL I WAS TOLD ABOUT IT.

1443
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:26,987
AND THEN I, ALMOST INSTANTLY,
    BEGAN EXPERIENCING IT.

1444
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:31,025
    I DON'T BELIEVE, LIKE,
THE MEDICAL EXPLANATION TO IT,

1445
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:34,161
   THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STUFF,
    JUST A SLEEP DISORDER.

1446
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,197
      THERE'S GOT TO BE
       WAY MORE TO IT.

1447
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:40,034
I TOLD MY ONE FRIEND ABOUT IT
   WHEN I WAS JUST TALKING,

1448
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:42,303
I WAS LIKE, "HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
     OF SLEEP PARALYSIS?"

1449
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:45,406
      SHE'S LIKE, "NO,"
AND SO I SHARED MY EXPERIENCE.

1450
01:20:45,408 --> 01:20:48,142
   <i> AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,</i>
      <i> SHE'S TEXTING ME.</i>

1451
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:51,278
  <i> SHE'S LIKE, "I HATE YOU.</i>
         <i> I HATE YOU.</i>

1452
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,982
<i> WHATEVER YOU WERE TELLING ME</i>
   <i> ABOUT HAPPENING TO YOU,</i>

1453
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:56,884
      <i> NOW IT'S STARTING</i>
      <i> TO HAPPEN TO ME."</i>

1454
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:09,964
    <i> KIND OF LIKE AN STD,</i>
<i> "SLEEP-TRANSMITTED DISEASE."</i>

1455
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,470
   THERE WAS AN EXPERIENCE
       DURING THIS TIME

1456
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:18,038
       THAT I ACTUALLY
      DID THINK I DIED.

1457
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,506
   WHOLE DREAM'S GOING FINE.

1458
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:22,076
     I DON'T REALLY KNOW
      WHAT WE'RE DOING.

1459
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:24,445
  IT'S ONE OF THOSE THREE-,
FOUR-DAY-FEELING TYPE DREAMS.

1460
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:28,115
I'M JUST KIND OF EXISTING IN IT,
     SORT OF ENJOYING IT.

1461
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:31,085
  AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, LIKE,
 SOMEBODY KNOCKS AT THE DOOR.

1462
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:36,423
<i>IT'S, LIKE, TWO HOMELESS DUDES.</i>
<i> AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET IN,</i>

1463
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:39,293
<i> AND I'M TRYING TO TELL THEM,</i>
 <i> "LISTEN, WE'RE AT CAPACITY.</i>

1464
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:41,996
<i>WE'RE AT CAPACITY FOR HOMELESS</i>
<i>PEOPLE IN MY WEIRD DREAM TOWN."</i>

1465
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:50,271
<i> THERE'S A GUY ON ROLLER BLADES</i>
<i> IN THE BACKGROUND, VERY '90s.</i>

1466
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:53,040
   <i> AND I WASN'T THINKING,</i>
    <i> BUT HE, LIKE, TURNS,</i>

1467
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:55,142
        <i> AND HE STARTS</i>
 <i> ROLLER-BLADING TOWARDS ME.</i>

1468
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:58,913
<i>AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S AWESOME.</i>
<i>HE'S GONNA COME INTO PLAY HERE.</i>

1469
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:01,181
         <i> THIS IS COOL.</i>

1470
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,450
<i>I'M PROBABLY GONNA WAKE UP SOON</i>
<i> 'CAUSE IT'S ALL EVAPORATING."</i>

1471
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:11,926
<i> AND AS HE GETS REALLY CLOSE,</i>
  <i> HE JUST PULLS OUT A GUN.</i>

1472
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:13,961
        <i> AND THEN I'M</i>
      <i> IN THE PARALYSIS.</i>

1473
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:16,130
  <i> BUT IT'S NOT A PARALYSIS</i>
   <i> I'VE EVER FELT BEFORE.</i>

1474
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:19,133
     <i> IT'S JUST NOTHING.</i>
    <i> I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.</i>

1475
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:22,937
   <i> I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.</i>
      <i> I'M JUST NOTHING.</i>

1476
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,039
      <i> SO I GUESS MAYBE</i>
    <i> THIS IS AN AFTERLIFE.</i>

1477
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:26,340
       <i> AND I WAS LIKE,</i>
     <i> "NAH, PROBABLY NOT.</i>

1478
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:28,142
     <i> MAYBE I'M IN A COMA."</i>

1479
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:30,244
  <i> AND I'M STARTING TO THINK</i>
       <i> SLEEP PARALYSIS</i>

1480
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:31,578
  <i> PROBABLY FINALLY FUCKED ME.</i>

1481
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,280
   <i> LIKE, I'M PROBABLY DONE.</i>

1482
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,349
  <i> AND I'VE PROBABLY STOPPED</i>
         <i> BREATHING,</i>

1483
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:37,117
  <i> AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS</i>
      <i> WHEN IT HAPPENS,</i>

1484
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,353
            <i> LIKE,</i>
    <i> I'M JUST NOTHINGNESS.</i>

1485
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:42,189
      <i> AND, LIKE, FIVE,</i>
     <i> TEN MINUTES GO BY,</i>

1486
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,092
     <i> AND I'M JUST LIKE--</i>
    <i> GET A LITTLE NERVOUS,</i>

1487
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:46,493
 <i> BUT, LIKE, AT THE SAME TIME,</i>

1488
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:49,029
          <i> I'M JUST</i>
   <i> KIND OF WEIRDLY SERENE.</i>

1489
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:50,965
      <i> LIKE, "THIS SUCKS."</i>

1490
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:54,234
           <i> AND...</i>
    <i> I REMEMBER THINKING,</i>

1491
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:55,736
     <i> LIKE, I'M GONNA TRY</i>
     <i> TO PULL OUT OF IT.</i>

1492
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:57,504
            <i> LIKE,</i>
 <i> THE SAME MOTION I WOULD DO</i>

1493
01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:59,740
       <i> TO PULL OUT OF</i>
      <i> SLEEP PARALYSIS,</i>

1494
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:01,508
     <i> I'M GONNA JUST TRY</i>
      <i> TO EMULATE THAT.</i>

1495
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:04,178
   <i> AND I TRY OVER AND OVER</i>
       <i> AND OVER AGAIN,</i>

1496
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:07,081
  <i> I MEAN, HUNDREDS OF TIMES.</i>

1497
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:09,350
      <i> YOU KNOW, JUST--</i>
 <i> BUT I'M GETTING SOMEWHERE,</i>

1498
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:14,254
  <i> AND I REMEMBER I COME UP</i>
  <i> FOR, LIKE, HALF A SECOND.</i>

1499
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:16,123
    <i> AND I CAN SEE MY ROOM.</i>

1500
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,992
    <i> IT'S LIKE I CAN OPEN</i>
    <i> MY EYES A LITTLE BIT,</i>

1501
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:20,160
       <i> BUT NOTHING'S--</i>
<i> THERE'S NOTHING THERE ANYMORE.</i>

1502
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,196
    <i> AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE</i>
       <i> I'M JUST IN BED</i>

1503
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:23,697
    <i> AND THE ROOM IS LIKE--</i>

1504
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,766
       <i> ALL THE DETAILS</i>
    <i> OF THE ROOM ARE GONE.</i>

1505
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:29,203
   <i> THERE'S-- I CAN SEE MY</i>
<i> NOW EX-GIRLFRIEND'S DRESSER,</i>

1506
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:32,373
     <i> HER LITTLE VANITY,</i>
 <i> AND THERE'S NOTHING ON IT.</i>

1507
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,142
       <i> AND I REMEMBER</i>
   <i> I CALLED OUT HER NAME,</i>

1508
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:36,677
       <i> AND NOBODY CAME,</i>

1509
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:38,445
       <i> AND THEN I WAS</i>
   <i> BACK IN THE PARALYSIS.</i>

1510
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,414
          <i> AND THEN</i>
    <i> IT WAS ANOTHER FIVE,</i>

1511
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:44,385
 <i> TEN MINUTES OF PULLING OUT,</i>
<i> AND THEN EVENTUALLY I WOKE UP.</i>

1512
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:48,055
           <i> AND...</i>
      <i> SHE WASN'T THERE.</i>

1513
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:52,426
     <i> NOBODY WAS AROUND,</i>
      <i> BUT... IT JUST--</i>

1514
01:23:52,428 --> 01:23:54,361
          <i> IT WAS--</i>
      <i> IT WAS THE WORST.</i>

1515
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,197
   <i> I JUST FELT LIKE I DIED.</i>

1516
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,767
  <i> YOU KNOW, IT BECAME THIS</i>
<i> KIND FO TURNING POINT FOR ME</i>

1517
01:23:59,769 --> 01:24:04,438
      IN, YOU KNOW, JUST--

1518
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,374
      HOW I SAW ALL THIS.

1519
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,244
   AND I DEFINITELY DIDN'T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN EVER AGAIN.

1520
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:13,180
<i> SO HOW DID THAT CHANGE</i>
           <i> YOUR--</i>

1521
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:15,215
   <i> THE WAY YOU SAW ALL THIS?</i>

1522
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:18,719
        IT JUST-- IT--
       WHEREAS BEFORE,

1523
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,422
   I FELT LIKE I WAS MAYBE,
          YOU KNOW,

1524
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:24,124
    LEARNING AND EXPLORING
AND IT WAS, LIKE, KIND OF FUN,

1525
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:26,326
     IT STOPPED BEING FUN.

1526
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:28,429
            LIKE,
   IT'S NOT LIKE I GET TO--

1527
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:31,098
    YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK
   ABOUT ASTRAL PROJECTION

1528
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,101
     AND ALL THESE, LIKE,
   AWESOME-SOUNDING THINGS,

1529
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:36,470
        LIKE HOW THEY
      GET TO FLY AROUND,

1530
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:41,442
 AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW,
       DO COOL THINGS.

1531
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:44,445
    AND I DON'T GET THAT.
I DON'T GET, YOU KNOW, THOSE.

1532
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:46,346
          I JUST GET
   THESE WEIRD EXPERIENCES

1533
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,283
      WHERE I FEEL LIKE,
        FOR A SECOND,

1534
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:52,419
     <i> I CAN SEE SOMETHING</i>
   <i> THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T.</i>

1535
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:57,558
  LIKE, THERE'S WHAT WE SEE
       IN THE WORLD...

1536
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,694
     AND RIGHT BEHIND IT,
   YOU KNOW, ALMOST LIKE--

1537
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:03,497
    IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING'S
CELLOPHANE-WRAPPED OR SOMETHING.

1538
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:06,633
AND FOR HALF A SECOND, THAT--
     THAT WRAPPER'S GONE,

1539
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:10,571
        AND I CAN SEE
    OR PERCEIVE SOMETHING

1540
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:14,875
   A LITTLE BIT MORE REAL--
    OR WHATEVER REAL IS--

1541
01:25:14,877 --> 01:25:16,443
      AND THEN IT'S GONE.

1542
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,679
       BUT I CAN SEE IT
   FOR THAT HALF A SECOND.

1543
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:21,315
  AND SO NO MATTER WHAT FEAR
 OR PAIN COMES ALONG WITH IT,

1544
01:25:21,317 --> 01:25:23,684
I ALWAYS GET THIS EXPERIENCE,
WHERE, EVEN IF IT'S IN MY HEAD,

1545
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:25,519
     IT'S MADE SOMETHING
         INTERESTING.

1546
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:27,321
        IT'S SOMETHING
     THAT I CAN PULL FROM

1547
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:31,525
      THAT MAKES MY LIFE
   ALMOST KIND OF WORTH IT,

1548
01:25:31,527 --> 01:25:33,327
     WHICH IS, YOU KNOW--
       FOR A LONG TIME,

1549
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:36,597
         IS SOMETHING
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE EVER HAD.

1550
01:25:36,599 --> 01:25:41,235
   AND IT'S GONNA PROBABLY
   JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE,

1551
01:25:41,237 --> 01:25:43,403
     AND I TRULY BELIEVE
        THAT ONE DAY--

1552
01:25:43,405 --> 01:25:46,573
  IT WILL BE THE REASON WHY,
LIKE, ONE DAY I DON'T WAKE UP.

1553
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:50,444
    AND ONE DAY I'M JUST--
  YOU KNOW, I DON'T BREATHE,

1554
01:25:50,446 --> 01:25:52,579
I CAN'T CONTROL THE BREATHING,
        AND IT'S DONE.

1555
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:59,219
     <i> AND I FEEL TERRIBLE</i>
   <i> FOR WHOEVER I'M DATING</i>

1556
01:25:59,221 --> 01:26:01,488
        <i> OR MARRIED TO</i>
     <i> WHEN THAT HAPPENS,</i>

1557
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:04,424
  <i> UM, BUT I'M KIND OF READY</i>
        <i> FOR THAT NOW.</i>

1558
01:26:04,426 --> 01:26:06,793
<i> CHRIS. HEY, CHRIS.</i>

1559
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:08,495
<i> YOU KNOW,</i>
  <i> I'M READY FOR THAT TO BE,</i>

1560
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,565
   <i> YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF</i>
     <i> WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.</i>

1561
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:16,236
<i> BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FIGURE OUT</i>
    <i> A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS</i>

1562
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:18,906
     BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,
  AND IT'S ALSO MADE ME FEEL

1563
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:21,208
       VERY COMFORTABLE
        WITH THE IDEA.

1564
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,477
            LIKE,
  IF SOMETHING'S HAPPENING,

1565
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:27,648
     THAT'S MORE THAN...
       I'M JUST CRAZY.

1566
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:29,583
  THEN SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
