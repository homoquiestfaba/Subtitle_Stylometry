6

<i>in baseball's celebrated history.</i>

7
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,797
<i>But this list would not be complete</i>

8
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:03,741
<i>Tommy “Santa” Santorelli.</i>

9
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,109
<i>In the middle of his 19th</i>
<i>and recently announced final season...</i>

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,149
<i>Tommy has been named</i>
<i>to 11 all-star teams...</i>

11
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:13,584
<i>broken dozens of records,</i>
<i>and seems destined for Cooperstown.</i>

12
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:18,113
<i>That is, if his ego</i>
<i>doesn't get in the way.</i>

13
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:21,422
<i>From humble beginnings,</i>
<i>Tommy Santorelli and his mother, Sara...</i>

14
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,589
<i>moved to Southern California</i>
<i>the summer Tommy turned 13.</i>

15
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:27,098
<i>It was there that Tommy</i>
<i>began playing sandlot ball...</i>

16
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:31,467
<i>and let's just say he's always</i>
<i>had a talent for the game.</i>

17
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:34,837
<i>It was with that July 4, 1976 catch...</i>

18
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:38,742
<i>that Tommy single-handedly</i>
<i>won the all-city championship.</i>

19
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:41,576
<i>Unfortunately, shortly thereafter...</i>

20
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,310
<i>Tommy's mother lost</i>
<i>a courageous battle with cancer...</i>

21
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:46,409
<i>and a local benefactor sent him...</i>

22
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:50,081
<i>to the legendary Baseball Academy</i>
<i>St. Agnus Preparatory School.</i>

23
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:53,684
<i>It was there that he coined</i>
<i>his own nickname...”“Santa. “</i>

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,255
<i>His explanation? Simple. It was a gift</i>
<i>for anyone to watch him play.</i>

25
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:02,426
<i>The loss of his mother</i>
<i>affected him deeply, and some see this...</i>

26
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:05,062
<i>as the reason for Tommy's</i>
<i>lack of loyalty to the list...</i>

27
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,299
<i>of major league teams</i>
<i>he's been a part of.</i>

28

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,969
<i>in his hometown of Los Angeles...</i>

30
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,775
<i>Tommy signed a three-year,</i>
<i>multi-million-dollar deal...</i>

31
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,612
<i>with the Dodgers.</i>

32
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:19,982
<i>Though Tommy's numbers</i>
<i>have been strong...</i>

33
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:24,717
<i>the Dodgers have suffered</i>
<i>their worst losing streak in years.</i>

34
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,852
- [All Groan]
- <i>Famed Dodger manager</i>
<i>Benny Rodriguez explains:</i>

35
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:32,023
<i>Problem is, guys like Tommy</i>
<i>don't play for the love of the game...</i>

36
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:34,658
and that translates
to the rest of the guys.

37
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:38,864
If the top earner don't care,
why should they?

38
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,373
Now, these kids...

39
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,534
They played because
they loved playing. That's it.

40
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,511
No... No money, no agents.

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,310
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>No complaining.</i>

42
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,509
Just the pure love of the game.

43
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:55,316
[Sighs] But ballplayers like them
don't exist anymore.

44
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,686
In fact, the old sandlot
doesn't even exist.

45
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,692
But, yeah, they got it.

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,661
Now, I've known Tommy
since he was a kid.

47
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,824
We grew up
in the same town, and...

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,061
I don't know, maybe it's
'cause I'm older than him.

49
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:12,036
But, uh, the sad thing is...

50
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,938
I could always tell...
he never got it.

51
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:18,169
What do I know?

52
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,408
I'm just an old, washed-up
manager now anyhow.

53
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,574
Let's get some dirt
on those uniforms, huh?

54
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:29,084
<i>[Woman] So what do you think</i>
<i>went wrong today, Santa?</i>

55
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,521
What are you askin' me for?
I went three for four.

56
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:34,560
- Homered in the sixth,
in case you didn't see that.
- Yeah, but you lost.

57
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:38,029
- No, sweetie. They lost.
- Did you just call me sweetie?

58
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:40,089
Listen, I'm just trying
to be friendly, sweetie.

59
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:44,068
Look. If these guys want to play
like a bunch of losers...

60
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,435
there's nothing I can do
to stop 'em, okay?

61
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:49,373
So, Tommy, with this being
your last season...

62
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,774
you must be looking back
on your career a little bit.

63
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,746
- Some say you're getting out
before the hammer falls.
- What?

64
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,873
Any regrets?

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,111
- Nope. None.
- Really?

66
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:02,154
What about that tell-all book
written by your ex-fiancée, Judy Kroll...

67
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,383
Sweetie?

68
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,187
Tommy, come on.
What do you have to...

69
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:21,636
Oh, it's a great day for baseball.

70
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:25,303
<i>Yeah, and one of the last.</i>

71
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:28,108
And I'll tell you what, boys.
When Santa's gone, party's over.

72
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,672
You better cherish these days
while they're here.

73
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,241
<i>He's in a talkative mood today.</i>

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,083
Yeah. Probably 'cause
he's not under oath.

75
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,123
Yo, 26, what gives?

76
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,183
Uh, it's for the July 4
fireworks next week.

77
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,855
That's next week.
What are they doin' in my yard today?

78
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,094
I don't know.
That's just what I was told.

79
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,295
You know, I've been comin' here
early for three years...

80
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,134
so this diva can have B.P.
All to himself...

81
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:56,004
- and he doesn't even know my name.
- Consider yourself lucky.

82
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:58,271
At least you're on
a first-number basis with him.

83
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:01,678
- Right.
- Yeah, they wanna see some fireworks?

84
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,682
I'll show 'em some fireworks.

85
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,018
Been workin' on that new pitch
we talked about?

86
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,456
What new pitch?

87
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,584
It's called a strike.

88
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:26,970
And Santa takes that
to the North Pole.

89
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:39,250
All right.

90
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,254
So on the big night,
when I say "now"...

91
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:45,587
I want you to light it up
right here, okay?

92
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,684
Hey, Lou.

93
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,059
- You understand me, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Bud.

94
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,257
- I'm just watching out for incoming.
- Okay.

95
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:55,893
You got a problem
with your breakin' stuff, kid.

96
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:00,101
- Yeah? What's that?
- It don't break.

97
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:03,836
- Excuse me?
- You're excused. Bring it.

98
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,173
<i>You understand me, right?</i>

99
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,771
On the big night, when I say "now"...

100
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:11,578
- I want you to light it up. Okay?
- What, now?

101
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,743
- Now.
- Now?

102
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,252
- When I say "now," Lou.
- Now?

103
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,220
Lou, your head's like cement.
Now is now.

104
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,847
- What do you mean, now?
- Now.

105
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,255
Okay, now. Whoo!

106
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:22,920
Lou! Not "now," now.
Pull it out.

107
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,297
- <i>Pull it out!</i>
- What do you mean, pull it out?
You said light it.

108
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,426
- Run!
- [Screams]

109
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,887
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>How far did he skid?</i>

110
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,159
<i>[Boy #2]</i>
<i>Pace it off, Q.</i>

111
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,827
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

112
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,927
he looks bad.

113
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:12,304
- We should do something.
- Yeah, kick him. See if he's fakin' it.

114
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:17,145
- Kick him? What, are you nuts?
- "Nuts"? Good idea.

115
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,742
Kick in the family jewels,
excellent fake breaker.

116
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,346
- <i>[Boy #2] That should wake him up.</i>
- Bad idea on many levels.

117
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:25,653
<i>As a medical procedure,</i>
<i>I think kicking...</i>

118
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,353
is way down on the list
of any prescribed remedies.

119
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:31,022
- Got any better ideas, Q?
- Slap in the face?

120
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:32,621
Bucket of water.
That always works.

121
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,860
My mom says you should
always wake someone gently.

122
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:38,426
- Gently.
- How about seeking medical attention, doofus?

123
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:41,932
The average ambulance
takes four minutes...

124
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,169
to respond to the scene
of an accident.

125
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:46,872
Kick in the family jewels,
lot faster.

126
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,642
- We're gonna get this guy help.
- Why are you in charge?

127
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:51,547
- Yeah, why are you in charge?
- Since when?

128
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,677
- I'm the tallest.
- What's that got to do with anything?

129
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,778
I am the smartest.

130
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:58,790
I think you mean shortest.
I'm the biggest.

131
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,521
- I think you mean fattest.
- Fattest.

132
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,790
- I say we go with the kick.
- I'm the captain.

133
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:07,162
- <i>[Boys] What?</i>
- Who made you captain, D. P?

134
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,064
The catcher is always the captain.

135
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:12,969
- You're not the captain. What about pitcher?
- [Chattering]

136
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,633
- Guys, look. Guys. He's waking up.
- [Groaning]

137
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,801
We could still kick him
before it's too late.

138
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,368
<i>[Boy #2] Ask him a question</i>
<i>that everyone knows.</i>

139
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:22,505
- See if he's okay.
- Good idea.

140
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,641
Who's the greatest
baseball player of all time?

141
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:27,185
- I am.
- [All] What?

142
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,244
- <i>[Boy] Who are you?</i>
- Tommy Santorelli.

143
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:32,257
Well, I don't care if you're Steve Garvey.
The answer is Babe Ruth.

144
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,556
- Hello! The Sultan of Swat.
- The King of Crash.

145
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,357
- The Colossus of Clout.
- The home Run King.

146
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,160
- The Babe.
- [Together] The Great Bambino.

147
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:43,031
No. It's Santa.

148
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,400
- Santa?
- As in Claus?

149
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,497
- [Groans]
- Can I kick him now?

150
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:51,169
- Go ahead.
- <i>[Man] Back up, kids!</i>

151
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:53,303
Clear out!

152
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,907
[Panting]

153
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,008
I'm trained for situations like this.

154
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,178
Now, who started it?

155
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,531
Stand back, boys.
I'm goin' in.

156
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:19,868
[All Groaning]

157
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:28,542
[Screaming]

158
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:32,412
Hey! What's goin' on here?

159
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,612
All right, kids, give him some air.
What happened?

160
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,587
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>He took a fly ball to the forehead.</i>

161
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:39,386
- Sorry, Uncle Chops.
- <i>Would have been a triple too...</i>

162
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,450

It's strawberry-banana.

Like my mom and the house...

228
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:40,498
and the kids from the sandlot.

229
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,625
But other things,
they're kind of foggy.

230
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:47,833
- Like I'm watching TiVo.
- TiVo? You mean TV? Uh, television?

231
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,842
No, TiVo. Pausing real time,
zapping commercials.

Unless I'm in them.

233

Why don't you wait outside a minute

I'd actually prefer to stay, Doc.

235
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:04,053
My trainers back at Dodger Stadium
give me the skinny all the time.

236
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,387

Well, his... Your retinas appear to be fine,

on your noggin, I think... [Chuckles]

239
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,423

No, no. That's okay.

Actually, Tommy, I would like to have
another word with your mother though.

- [Whispering] In private.
- Whatever.

- <i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>
- Sara, I think Tommy's
suffering from some sort...

<i>of emotional stress,</i>
<i>but he'll be fine.</i>

251

You are the one that
I am concerned about.

252
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:58,366
Me? I'm well, thank you.

253
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,642
I guess I'm strong enough
for the chemo again.

254
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:05,809
Mmm. Then maybe we should
pick up on the treatments...

255

where you left off before the move.

256
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,454
That'd be fine, Doctor.

257
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:13,822
Now, if he starts acting up again...

258
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,418
I'd show him some pictures
of family and friends...

259
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:20,431
just to bring him back
to reality, as it were.

260
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:23,093
Maybe that's what he's fighting.

261
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,160
Reality.

262
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,773
That was surreal.

263
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,776
I don't know about you, Mom,
but I could sure use a drink.

264
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:34,472
We could go get a soda.

265
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,810

00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:55,633

Oh. And there's you at Big Bear.

271
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:01,438
And this is that day
last summer, you remember...

272
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,941
when we went to that music festival
with your Cousin Jimmy?

273
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,877
<i>Oh, right. Shame what happened</i>
<i>to him though.</i>

274
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:10,006
What happened to him?
Did Margie call with some bad news?

275
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:13,677
No. When Jimmy's band
broke up in the early '90s...

276
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:16,881
he got himself a job
at home Depot in Calabasas.

277
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,948
What's home Depot?

278
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,460

- You?
- I'm talkin' about Benny.

- [Chucking] That bum?
- <i>“Bum”?</i>

306
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:53,277
He's got the best batting average

Wait. He's here too?

308
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,382
- Benny's amazing, man.
- The best.

309
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:04,486
Please. Benny only got as far
as he did because he can run.

310
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,656
Then his knee tanked him.
He retired and became a coach.

- <i>[Sara] You should go with them, honey.</i>

00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,659
<i>I want you three to play outfield.</i>

326
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:49,223
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>We've got this new kid today.</i>

327
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:52,702
- <i>We're gonna have four outfielders then.</i>
- <i>That makes sense.</i>

328
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:55,331
- <i>Let's play some ball.</i>
- <i>All right, fellas, let's go.</i>

329
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:58,433
<i>I want you to focus. When I start talking,</i>
<i>I want you listening, okay?</i>

330
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,911
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

331
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,073
[Chattering, Whooping]

332
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:07,084
- Hey, Benny, over here.
- You might wanna get a little further out there.

333
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,586
- <i>[Boy] Out there, Two Ton.</i>
- Here we go, fellas.

334
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,680
Hey, Benny.
It's pretty weird, right?

335
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,248
I mean, it's like
<i>The Twilight Zone</i> or something.

336
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,726
Maybe you could tell me
how we, uh, got...

337
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,820
here.

338
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,791
You asking me how I got here?

339
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,927
Same way these kids
are gonna get there.

340
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:28,531
- 'Cause they love to play ball.
That's the key, kid.
- You look so...

341
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,598
- So...
- Yeah?

342
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,237
- Well, young.
- Really?

343
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:37,077
Maybe I should be lookin' in the same
mirror you're lookin' in, kid.

344
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:39,447
<i>No, I wouldn't really</i>
<i>recommend that.</i>

345
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,645
Come on, hotshot.
Let's see what you got.

346
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,314
You know what?
I think I'm just gonna watch.

347
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,257
- Okay.
- Some all-star.

348
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,317
"All-star"? Ha.

349
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,762
As in, "I'll start later."
Just full of it.

350
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:58,969
I'll tell you, try to do a weirdo a favor,
and it just gets "weirdo-er."

351
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,563
- <i>Yeah, really.</i>
- Get ready, fellas. Here it comes.

352
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,801
- <i>Let's go.</i>
- <i>Get it!</i>

353
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,901
- <i>Come on. That's it.</i>
- I've got it.

354
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:09,106
<i>Nice. Now throw it back home.</i>

355
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:11,581
<i>Oh, nice throw.</i>

356
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,044
<i>Yeah, nice catch.</i>

357
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,789
You new to town?

358
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:28,697
- Not really.
- I'm Squints Palledorous.

359
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:32,703
- Baseball commissioner, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

360
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,363
<i>Go, Wings! Go, Wings!</i>

361
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,170
- Wings.
- You know Wings McKay?

362
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:40,177
<i>Sure. You can never forget</i>
<i>that kind of speed.</i>

363
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:42,611
[Laughs] Kid's got no second gear,
that's for sure.

364
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:44,672
It's gonna catch up to him though.

365
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,776
- I don't think anyone can catch him.
- Except the cops.

366
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:51,482
- <i>[Boy] Hey, Wok, move to second.</i>
- <i>[Boy #2] Come on, Q.</i>

367
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:55,015
- Just pick up the ball, Q.
- In a minute.

368
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:57,824
That's Q. Short for I.Q.
He's wicked smart.

369
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:59,887
Not really that great
an outfielder though.

370
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:02,991
I'm using the probability calculation
of wind-speed velocity...

371
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,536
versus the angle
of the descent of the ball.

372
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:09,836
I'm gonna descend upon your head if you
don't pick up that ball and throw it in.

373
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:13,503
Takes it all apart.
Breaks everything down to a science.

374
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:16,810
You ever notice how the wind-speed
velocity changes when you speak, Two Ton?

375
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:18,873
Pick up the ball <i>now.</i>

376
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:24,886
I guess it paid off. He's only one
of the biggest brain surgeons...

377
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,755
I mean brains in the world.

378
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:30,317
[Laughs]
You okay, kid?

379
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,990
You might wanna get
out of the sun.

380
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:37,001
It's not the sun.
I just can't believe what I'm seeing.

381
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:39,731
That's not good. Here.

382
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:42,603
You give this card
to your mom, come in...

383
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,075
I'll set you up
with some quality shades.

384
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:47,738
Speakin' of the shade.
Come on, kid.

385
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,043
Follow me.

386
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:53,448
What's up with this "kid" crap?

387
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,647
[Benny]
Oh, nice, Timber. Go to second.

388
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,958
- <i>All right, here we go. Another...</i>
- Wings, go to first.

389
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:06,429
- <i>[Benny] Nice catch.</i>
- That guy taking the mound.

390
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:09,228
His name's Timber.
That kid can throw some real heat.

391
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:12,759
- Yeah.
- <i>But he can't pitch at batters, right?</i>

392
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:16,467
<i>Yeah, left or right. Put anybody in the box,</i>
<i>his arm turns into spaghetti.</i>

393
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:21,544
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

394
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:23,808
Okay, that's good.
Just keep throwin' 'em a little lower.

395
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:25,907
You're doin' good.

396
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:28,612
Should have worn a batting helmet.

397
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:31,053
You know a lot
about these kids for a new kid.

398
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:33,216
- [Chuckles]
- What do you know about Wok and Roll?

399
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,283
It's a little old school.

400
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,329
Lately I've been getting into some
hip-hop, some rap here and there.

401
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:41,730
What? I'm talking about
Matt "Wok" Wakamoto...

402
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,995
and Rolando "Roll" Alvarez.

403
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,970
Of course.
Wok and Roll.

404
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,735
- How could I forget those guys?
- "Forget those guys"?

405
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:54,108
No, no. I mean, together they play great,
separate they play awful.

406
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,307
If you know so much about these guys,
how come I don't know you?

407
00:23:57,382 --> 00:24:00,317
How come you're not playing?

408
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,147
Okay, guys, bring it in.
Bring it in.

409
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:06,248
- <i>[Boy] You guys, go. Come on.</i>
- <i>[Boy #2] Go!</i>

410
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:08,316
Okay, now...

411
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:12,261
do one of you guys have the guts
to hit off a real major leaguer?

412
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:15,129
- <i>Oh, no, not me.</i>
- I gotta rest my arm, Benny.

413
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,668
- No, he's your guy.
- I'm the catcher.

414
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:20,933
Right here, partner.
Right here.

415
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:24,134
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>Guys, I gotta see this. Okay, fine.</i>

416
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,939
<i>[Boy #2]</i>
<i>He's gonna get his butt whupped.</i>

417
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:30,209
- <i>Come on, strike him out, Benny.</i>
- <i>Come on, Benny.</i>

418
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:34,116
- Strike him out.
- All right.

419
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:36,882
- What's your name, kid?
- Tommy Santorelli.

420
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:40,516
And I promise you this.
You're not gonna forget it, Benny.

421
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:43,390
- Ooh!
- Oh, man.
- <i>Ho, ho.</i>

422
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,829
- Who does this kid think he is, hank Aaron?
- I like your confidence, kid.

423
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,993
- Now let's see what you got.
- This is like deja vu.

424
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:53,128
- What's like deja vu?
- <i>This</i> is like deja vu.

425
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:56,868
What's like deja vu?
[Laughs]

426
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:59,376
Got ya.

427
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:02,140
I'm just gonna go nice and easy
on ya at first, okay?

428
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:05,479
You know what, Benny? That's always
been your problem. You're too nice.

429
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,712
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

430
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:09,981
[Jeering]

431
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:13,149
Now bring it.

432
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:15,250
Okay.

433
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,591
And Santa takes it
to the North Pole.

434
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,436
Nice shot, kid.
All right, now a little more.

435
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,284
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Benny. Come on.

436
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:47,915
<i>Yeah, I think his swing</i>
<i>might be better than Hank Aaron's.</i>

437
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,029
Yeah.

438
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,369
<i>All right, now, I'm gonna give you</i>
<i>a little more heat, okay?</i>

439
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,872
Please hit this.

440
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,431
Don't worry about it.
I'm the Santa. Come on.

441
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,107
Whoa.

442
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,314
Good pick, kid.

443
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:24,557
Wait. Your name's Ryan, right?

444
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,428
Hey, what do you say?

445
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,638
<i>Where'd you learn</i>
<i>to hit like that, kid?</i>

446
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:37,675
Starin' down the likes
of Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens.

447
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:41,406
- You learn fast, or you die trying.
- Who are those guys?

448
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,608
- <i>Must be seventh graders.</i>
- Seventh graders.

449
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:48,175
Hey, with him on our team,
we could enter the all-city championships.

450
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,518
- "Enter"? You guys could win it.
- Very high probability.

451
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,821
Wait a minute, guys. Who said anything
about me playing on your team?

452
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,793
I'm not gonna be here that long.

453
00:26:56,862 --> 00:27:00,195
Look at it this way. I showed you
how it's done. That's my gift to you.

454
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:03,860
Hey, they don't call me
the Santa for nothin'.

455
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,700
- [Grumbling]
- Stupid Santa.

456
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,438
You got some talent, kid.

457
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,809
There's a lot more
to baseball than talent.

458
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,179
Maybe you should have taken some
of that advice in the '81 World Series.

459
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:22,677
[Chuckles]

460
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:26,485
I like you, kid.
You got quite the imagination.

461
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:28,856
'81 World Series, huh?

462
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:32,556
- You guys see that homer?
- It was pretty good, right?

463
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:34,792
- Yeah.
- You need to show us how.

464
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:37,699
<i>- Squints! How's it goin' there, buddy?</i>
- Like you really care.

465
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:40,135
Just being polite.

466
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,399
<i>EJ., all the way to the fence now.</i>

467
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,638
What are you doing here, Needman?

468
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,341
- Taking some measurements.
- Measurements? For what?

469
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:52,883
Oh, didn't you hear?
City's putting the sandlot up for sale.

470
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:56,648
- You can't sell the sandlot.
- Oh, yeah, they can, and I'm buying it.

471
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:58,485
- Excuse me?
- <i>Face it, Squints.</i>

472
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:00,752
This old field has run its course.

473
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:03,727
Besides, there's no real talent
over here nowadays anyway.

474
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,990
Well, you didn't see what I just saw.

475
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:09,158
Well, I know that I can fetch
a nice price tag...

476
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,998
on some newly developed condos
right where we're standing.

477
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,733
Well, as long as I'm commissioner here,
I don't see that happening.

478
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:19,766
Yeah? Well, then clean your glasses...

479
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:23,110
<i>because you got the future</i>
<i>right here, and you don't even see it.</i>

480
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,672
Don't slack that off now!

481
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:28,413
E. J! Take it all the way
out to the fence.

482
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:30,478

- Old Man Mertle's house.

was once a great baseball player...

862
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:12,462
until he went blind after getting hit
with a baseball in the head.

863
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:15,464
Legend has it that he has a secret stash
of old baseball stuff.

00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:17,659
[Tommy]
So what ever happened to Mr. Mertle?

865
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:21,466
Some say he just died.
Others say he up and vanished.

- Vanished?

01:09:04,754 --> 01:09:07,484
Give me some more.
I'm going for eight.

1122
01:09:07,557 --> 01:09:10,355
- <i>[D.P.] Beat your own record.</i>
- Put them in.

1123
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:12,155
- Go! Go!
- <i>Put more.</i>

1124
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:19,992
- Hey, sorry I'm late, buddy.
- Oh, Benny.

1125
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:23,470
You didn't have to come help. I'm sure
you must have more important things to do.

1126
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:25,564
Come on.
What's more important than this?

1127
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:28,804
Looks good.
The old gang would be proud.

1128
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:31,403
[Squints] hey, did you hear ham
is wrestling at the State Fair next month?

1129
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:34,075
The old hambino is still at it, huh?

1130
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:39,417
- How's your knee?
- Ah, Doc says I'll probably be
out for the rest of the season.

1131
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:42,219
- I'm sorry, Benny.
- Hey, don't be. I'll be all right.

1132
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:45,317
Nothing like it though, huh?

1133
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:48,488
Coming out to the old ball field,
spending the summer with your friends...

1134
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:51,863
- playing the sport you love.
- Yeah.

1135
01:09:51,934 --> 01:09:54,266
Playing in the majors
must be really great, huh?

1136
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:57,238
I was talking about you guys.

1137
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:04,112
<i>[Ryan's Voice]</i>
<i>Friendship, dummy.</i>

1138
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:09,717
- So how's Wendy?
- Great.

1139
01:10:09,785 --> 01:10:13,721
- <i>[Benny] Yeah? How many kids you got now?</i>
- Oh, four.

1140
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:17,190
- <i>Bet they're keeping you busy.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1141

1143
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:45,979
Hey.

1144
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:50,448
Why aren't you at the game?

1145
01:10:50,526 --> 01:10:53,154
I don't know if I should go.

1146
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:55,789
Why not?

1147
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:58,356
Because I need to be here with you.

1148
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:03,463
Honey, come here.

1149
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:17,512
I'm so grateful to have
such a wonderful son.

1150
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:22,321
Now you go play
the game you love.

1151
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:24,951
<i>I'll be here when you get back.</i>

1152
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:29,430
Good things happen
to good people, Tommy.

1153
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:36,004
I'll come home as soon
as the game's over.

1154
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:38,506
I promise.

1155
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:45,105
I love you, Mom.

1156
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:53,155
- [Man] I know. Exactly. That's the problem.
- Sit down. I saved a spot.

1157
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:56,214
<i>This place is a disaster.</i>

1158
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:00,560
- This place is a gift.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

1159
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:05,294
I helped my dad measure this dump. We cream
the ball, even you could hit a home run.

1160
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:08,132
- <i>[Needman] Let's go, guys.</i>
<i>Go on. Get in here. Hustle up!</i>
- Yeah!

1161
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:11,903
- So what are we going to do today?
- [All] Win!

1162
01:12:11,974 --> 01:12:16,035
That's right, and I'm gonna bulldoze
this place first thing in the morning.

1163
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:18,307
Hey, Bill!

1164
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:22,843
- How are you doing?
- Better than a doubleheader on Sundays.

1165
01:12:22,918 --> 01:12:25,887
- What do you got for me today?
- I got something good for you today.

1166
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:30,085
- I hope it's better than that hair.
- Yeah. Yeah. E. J!

1167
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:32,559
- Come on over here. You remember E.J.
- Oh, absolutely.

1168
01:12:32,628 --> 01:12:35,722
- E.J., how are you doing?
- How could I forget? Nice to meet you.

1169
01:12:35,798 --> 01:12:38,494
Nice to meet you too. But how about that
Santorelli kid I've been hearing about?

1170
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:42,162
- They tell me a lot about him.
I want to see him.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, Tommy.

1171
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,765
- Come on over here.
I've got somebody for you to meet.
- Hey, Tommy. How are you doing?

1172
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:49,174
I've heard a lot about you. I've come to watch
you play. I want to see what you can do.

1173
01:12:49,245 --> 01:12:52,408
- Yeah. E.J. Here, he's been...
- I've been practicing.

1174
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:55,348
- I've heard a lot about you too.
- Okay, well, I'm going to go warm up.

1175
01:12:55,418 --> 01:12:57,852
- All right, Tommy. Nice to meet you.
- Nice seeing you.

1176
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,754
- I'm gonna go warm up.
You won't be disappointed.
- All right. Yeah, l... I hope not.

1177
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:03,883
No. E.J., he's...
he's been improving, yeah.

1178
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:07,053
- Yeah, well, he has great coaching.
- Yeah, yeah, that's right, yeah.

1179
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:09,689
Welcome to the Valley Little League
Tournament championship game.

1180
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:13,565
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please
rise for our national anthem.

<i>Let's cream these losers.</i>

[Whispering]
Good luck.

1185
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,010
They'll be sorry
they were ever born.

1186
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:04,314
I still can't believe
he'd play for Needman!

1187
01:14:04,386 --> 01:14:07,651
- I knew he was a traitor all along.
- So duplicitous.

1188
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:13,127
Man, we are so dead. Not only did we
lose Tommy, but we're minus a player.

1189
01:14:13,195 --> 01:14:15,595
- All right, guys, listen up...
- I've got something to say.

1190
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:18,360
- What?
- Did Ryan just speak?

1191
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:21,528
<i>I've been around you guys</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

1192
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:26,098
One thing I know is that Benny's right.
You guys love baseball.

1193
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:30,441
You eat, drink and sleep baseball,
but nothing compares to playing it.

1194
01:14:30,513 --> 01:14:34,005
If we give up now, well, you can say
good-bye to the sandlot forever.

1195
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,643
- But you don't...
- Zip it, tubby!

1196
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,846
It's my turn to talk.

1197
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:42,186
<i>Tommy taught us a lot</i>
<i>about baseball skills.</i>

1198
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:46,024
Instead of being mad at him, let's show him
exactly what he failed to learn from us...

1199
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:48,757
<i>how to play the game we love.</i>

1200
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:56,170
I don't know about you guys, but I don't want
to lose this field to a bunch of butt-faces.

1201
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,901
- The mouth on that kid.
- <i>So what are we gonna do today, boys?</i>

1202
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:03,376
- We're gonna win!
- <i>That's right.</i>

1203
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:13,711
All right, guys.

1204
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:16,883
What he said.
Everybody in.

1205
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:21,862
- Yeah!
- [All] One, two, three! Sandlots!

1206
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:28,501
- I need to talk to you, Needman.
- Hey, isn't that that Santorelli kid?

1207
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,903
I thought he was on the Sandlot team.

1208
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:35,034
It ain't over till the fat lady sings.

1209
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:39,410
Oh. Oh, uh, sorry.
[Chuckles]

1210
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:43,713
- Take your position, Santorelli.
You can tell me after the game.
- But I need to talk to you!

1211
01:15:43,786 --> 01:15:47,517
Yeah! Whoo!

1212
01:15:50,426 --> 01:15:53,918
Are you deaf, son?
Move it. Now!

1213
01:15:56,599 --> 01:15:59,625
- Santorelli!
- What is he doing?

1214
01:15:59,702 --> 01:16:02,227
Where are you going?
I told you your position.

1215
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:08,265
Wait! What are you doing, boy?
Son, you do not want to do this.

1216
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:10,642
- What do you want?
- I want to win.

1217
01:16:10,713 --> 01:16:12,578
Yeah, so do we.

1218
01:16:12,648 --> 01:16:16,049
- Get lost, Tommy.
- Yeah, vamoose. We don't need you.

1219
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,746
Look, I made a mistake.

1220
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:22,723
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- What are you saying?

1221
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:28,229
I made a deal to play for Needman's team,
because I thought it was my destiny.

1222
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,765
This isn't the part where
you go off about the Dodgers...

<i>the Hall of Fame and your</i>
<i>smoking-hot girlfriends, is it?</i>

1224
01:16:33,903 --> 01:16:39,307
No. This is the part where I throw
that all away to do what's right.

1225
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:42,742
Play ball with my friends.

1226
01:16:42,811 --> 01:16:45,336
- What did I say?
- That is, if you'll have me.

1227
01:16:49,184 --> 01:16:52,847
Look, I would rather lose
a game with my real team...

1228
01:16:52,922 --> 01:16:55,686
than win one
for all the wrong reasons.

1229
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:57,749
You made a bad mistake.

1230
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:03,026
We're not gonna lose.

1231
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,965

1232
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:10,369
Thanks, Tommy.

1233
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:16,511
Son, you had me going there.
[Chuckles]

1234
01:17:16,578 --> 01:17:20,378
What are you doing? Now, that is not
the right decision to make there, boy.

1235
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:23,612
Hey, Earl.

1236
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:25,779

- Great to have you back, Tommy.
- [All] Yeah!

1240

Yeah, and that's not the half of it.
