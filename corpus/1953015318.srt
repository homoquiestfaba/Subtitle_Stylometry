1
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,559
- What's up, Claire?
- Hey.

2
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,461
So this is it, huh?
Just you and me?

3
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:58,000
- End of days.
- Yeah.

4
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:01,138
Have you talked to Ron?
Really?

5
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,563
Ron is in Barbados snorkeling to the
ever-elusive double back sablefish.

6
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:10,019
And he left exposed instructions
not to be disturbed.

7
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:14,062
You know, well, If you own this place,
you'd be at the Barbados too.

8
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:18,012
Sure I would, especially if I had 2 sabs
back at home waiting to cover for me.

9
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:24,586
- Did you get your camera fixed?
- No. It's totaled.

10
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,239
I have to send it back
to Pentax's suck-ass.

11
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:31,802
I have my microphone, though. So we can
make do with the EVP investigations.

12
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:33,635
Okay.

13
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,957
Oh, hey.
That reminds me.

14
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,494
I have to show you something.

15
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:47,606
So, I was trolling around on some of the
paranormal forums last night.

16
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:50,164
And I came across something
pretty interesting.

17
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,965
You definitely gonna wanna see this.

18
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:53,602
What is it?

19
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,674
Hold on.
Just watch.

20
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:01,537
Look closely.

21
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,755
I missed it the first time.
It can blow your mind.

22
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,452
Really heavy.

23
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:38,538
You bastard!

24
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,458
So good.

25
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:44,168
Oh my God, every time.

26
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:47,123
Oh, my God.

27
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,448
What room did you take?

28
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,060
- 216.
- Of course.

29
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,462
Hey, I've been here since last night.
This is just the way it goes.

30
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,135
225 is taken.

31
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:14,600
All the rest is pretty much wide open.

32
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:18,372
Second floor only, I don't remember.
The third floor is already done.

33
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,610
Only one guest? Brutal.

34
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:23,803
It don't take a genius to get why
this place is going out of business.

35
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:30,240
Okay, I'll take room 214.

36
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,060
I figure we'll take 7 to 7 shifts,
something like that?

37
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,391
You're right. Sounds good.
I'll bring it back down.

38
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,424
Okay, If I could just
get you to sign that?

39
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:15,513
This is your room key.
Number 224.

40
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:19,211
You wanna head up to the top of
the stairs, and take a right,

41
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:22,212
and then another quick right,
so like a doubly,

42
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:26,481
and then you go about halfway down of the
hallway, and It's on your right-hand side.

43
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,408
You can't miss it.

44
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,007
Thank you.

45
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,978
Do you know who that is?

46
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:58,942
- It's Leanne Rease-Jones.
- Okay.

47
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:02,865
She was the mom on
"Like Mother, Like Son"?

48
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:06,912
- Dude, she is super famous.
- Okay, whatever.

49
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:14,147
Oh, man. Leanne Rease-Jones.
I wonder what she's doing here.

50
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:18,742
She's guest speaking at some
convention in Pots Town.

51
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,340
- How do you know that?
- She told me.

52
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,597
- What? What else did she tell you?
- Nothing. Why are you acting so weird?

53
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,641
- I'm not.
- Well, here is her autograph. Just relax.

54
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,912
Whatever.
Why are you being so grouchy today?

55
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:35,129
I'm not. I'm just stressed.
This site is killing me.

56
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,782
Let me see it.

57
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,026
Looks good.

58
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:50,422
I hate web design.

59
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,613
It looks really good.

60
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,318
I like the little ghost.

61
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:01,063
It's not the most professional,
but it's not bad.

62
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:04,647
There's a lot of money in this right now,
I just... I have to act fast.

63
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,489
Looks really good.
I like it.

64
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,422
And, you know,
once you get some proof on that,

65
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:13,123
it won't matter what it looks like.

66
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:16,582
Hey, so I was thinking...

67
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:20,156
It seems like, whenever something
really creepy happens,

68
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,357
nobody else is around, right?

69
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:27,867
Like every time you've seen stuff,
you were alone. So...

70
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,563
I was just thinking that since
the hotel is practically empty,

71
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:36,156
we might have a good chance
of making some real contact.

72
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,822
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:41,360
Yeah.
I think this weekend's gonna be it.

74
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:43,861
We're gonna get something good,
I can feel it.

75
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:51,938
- What?
- What?

76
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:54,187
- What?
- What?

77
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,416
Front desk.

78
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,629
Yes, Mrs. Rease-Jones.

79
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,803
Oh, sure, I'll send them
right up for you.

80
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,594
You're welcome.

81
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,635
- I forgot to stack the towels.
- I'll get them.

82
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:18,374
Good, save me the hassle
of that gale on 225,

83
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,295
she's driving me nuts and
I don't want her to see me.

84
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,714
Uh, that lady with the kid?
I know, what's her deal?

85
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:27,076
She was gonna give me total
aggro vibes upstairs.

86
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,214
She had a huge fight
with her husband

87
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:32,553
and she's staying here till Sunday
with her son as payback.

88
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:35,614
she's having a very hard time
and she wants him to realize

89
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:37,752
how hard his life is without her.

90
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,659
- How do you know all that?
- She told me.

91
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:45,634
Why do you always seem so surprised
that I talk to the guests?

92
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,036
Go on, superfan, don't keep
the towels waiting.

93
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:12,318
Mrs. Rease-Jones, I have your towels.

94
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,653
Mrs. Rease-Jones?

95
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,286
Be a lamb and hand me one of those?

96
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,146
Thank you.

97
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:35,701
You're welcome, Mrs. Rease-Jones.

98
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,559
- Call me Lee.
- Okay.

99
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:45,296
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Claire.

100
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,550
You're a lifesaver, Claire.

101
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,076
Oh, no no no, I couldn't. I couldn't.

102
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:56,314
Come on, you're hurting
an old lady's feelings.

103
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:04,796
Thanks, Mrs... Lee.

104
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:12,520
I am a really big fan of yours.

105
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,812
"Like Mother, Like Son" was one
of my all time favorite shows.

106
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,803
And you were amazing in it.
And... And...

107
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:22,896
"The Waking Of Eleanor".

108
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,490
I love that film.

109
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:29,711
I used to watch it all the time.
Crying out with my mom.

110
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:32,565
I even styled my hair in
little braids like you did.

111
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,788
But they never looked good, though.

112
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:39,858
Well, thank you.
That's very nice of you to say.

113
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:44,745
- And what do you do, Claire?
- I work at the front desk. So...

114
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:48,229
If there is anything else that you need,
just let me know. I mean...

115
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,983
This is our last weekend open.

116
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:53,144
So Luke and I are the only
people on staff today.

117
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:56,458
We actually sleep in here instead
of going home, which is pretty crazy.

118
00:13:56,846 --> 00:14:01,466
I meant in life.
Are you an aspiring actress?

119
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,541
Is that what makes you such
a stout fan of my work?

120
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:07,660
Me? No.

121
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,496
I just work at the hotel.

122
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:25,701
But... I'm... I'm just kinda like...
you know, between... stuff.

123
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:33,964
Okay.

124
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,315
Oh, Claire...

125
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,355
The towels.

126
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:43,323
Right. Of course. Yes.

127
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:45,828
There you go.

128
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:56,628
How'd it go?

129
00:14:57,803 --> 00:15:00,618
You two gonna collaborate on something?

130
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,944
She got to make me feel
like an asshole.

131
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:07,685
Well, she is an actress.

132
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:10,878
What's that supposed to mean?

133
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:13,741
What do you know about
actresses, anyway?

134
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:17,627
I don't know a lot, but I do know a
little bit about a lot of things.

135
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,599
Why you have to be such a bummer?

136
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,653
And why you have to be so negative?

137
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:29,531
I'm not negative, I'm realistic.
There's a difference.

138
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,589
You're a pessimist.

139
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,990
Pessimism is just a higher form
of optimism.

140
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,159
If you expect nothing from people, then you
go through life being pleasantly surprised.

141
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:44,612
Yeah, but nobody loves an albatross.

142
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,245
- I need some coffee. You want anything?
- I do not.

143
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:50,070
Fine.

144
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:20,723
Hey, how's it going?

145
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,820
What can I get for you?

146
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:28,321
Uhm...
uh...

147
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,187
Tell you what.
You take your time,

148
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,388
if you have any questions,
just let me know.

149
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:50,691
Doesn't a Cyclops always has one eye?

150
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:55,349
What do you mean?

151
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:58,022
Never mind.

152
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:00,568
I will have a...

153
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:05,362
large soy mocha latte
with a pump of caramel.

154
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:06,852
Good choice.

155
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,990
So how are things going next door?

156
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,188
Fine.

157
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,929
Can I speak frankly with you?

158
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:31,166
I mean, I know we don't know each other
that well, but I see you all the time

159
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,191
and we are all girls here.

160
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:37,254
This Sunday my boyfriend is taking
me on a picnic to the bay.

161
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,142
And I'm really excited. I know
is gonna be super romantic...

162
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:45,567
and I think that I'm not letting
myself be fully excited

163
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,999
because there's something in our
relationship that's been bothering me...

164
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,119
which that we've been together
for almost a year...

165
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,220
and he still has not told me
that he loves me.

166
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,180
I just need to talk to somebody about it
because I don't wanna ask him to tell me.

167
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:59,262
And he said it on IM.
That's the thing. He said it on IM.

168
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:01,842
Which my friends say that it doesn't count.
It's like saying "I love you" during sex.

169
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:03,042
It doesn't count.

170
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,128
And so I wonder...

171
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,781
Where is your coffee?

172
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:14,993
They ran out.

173
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:21,024
Is that annoying girl still there?

174
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:23,648
Yes.

175
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,221
What a failbug.

176
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,321
Epic.

177
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:47,369
Do you ever think about when
you dropped out of the college

178
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,727
and wonder if you made
the right choice?

179
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,967
Every day.

180
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:56,502
Why do people have
such high expectations?

181
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,270
Everything happens
for a reason, Claire.

182
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:09,948
Nobody just ends up
at the Yankee Pedlar.

183
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,942
I guess.

184
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,440
- You know what really gets me though?
- Hold that on.

185
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:21,336
My eyes feel like they've been
doused with xxxxxxxx

186
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:23,290
I need to go upstairs.

187
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:29,695
What?

188
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:34,834
I'm sorry. I'm dead. We can talk about your
upcoming quarter life crisis tomorrow.

189
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:38,038
- I just need to tap out right now.
- Fine.

190
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:40,365
Leave your computer, though.

191
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:46,315
What? I'm not gonna hack the system.
I just want look for a pair of high tops.

192
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,874
And it gets really boring when
there's nobody else in the hotel.

193
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,639
And my book sucks.

194
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:58,571
Okay, just be careful with it.

195
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,219
Dah.

196
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,239
Oh, and if you get the itch
to do any recording,

197
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,568
the recorder is charging
in the back office.

198
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,477
Remember how to use it,
you just point the microphone in the...

199
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,247
I know how to do it.
I get it.

200
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:13,961
Jesus, I would hate to be
a ghost in this hotel.

201
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,235
- Goodnight, Claire.
- Goodnight, Luke.

202
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,950
Where is your website?

203
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:38,129
Well done. I might forget
to remind him about this.

204
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:54,522
Tragedy.

205
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,747
Creepy.

206
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:43,284
Shit.
I can't work this thing.

207
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,826
I don't wanna scare you,
but I stand right behind you. Sorry.

208
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:43,140
Fuck! What the fuck?!
Oh my God!

209
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:46,184
Jesus Christ, you scared
the shit out of me!

210
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,309
What are you doing over here, anyway?

211
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,144
- I thought I heard a noise, Luke.
- Like what?

212
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:55,524
Banging, like a banging, man!

213
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:57,816
- Okay, well...
- God!

214
00:24:57,817 --> 00:25:01,236
I woke up and I couldn't get back to sleep.
So we can switch now, if you want.

215
00:25:01,237 --> 00:25:04,159
Fuck. Okay. Dah! Dah!

216
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,169
Sorry.

217
00:25:07,784 --> 00:25:09,507
Fuck you.

218
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,933
Do you know the story
of Madeline O'Malley?

219
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:32,174
She was the one that
died here in the hotel.

220
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:37,270
She hung herself after her fiance
stood her up on her wedding day.

221
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:43,730
The original owners of the hotel,

222
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:46,731
thought it would be bad press
and hurt the business.

223
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:53,047
So, they hid her dead body in
the wood cellar for three days.

224
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:56,620
Before they could smuggle
her out of the loading bay.

225
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,852
When the people of the town finally
figured out what had happened here...

226
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:01,491
they were outraged.

227
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:06,492
So, the owners had to close
the hotel down and were forced to sell it.

228
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:10,546
Nobody came through here
again until the '60s.

229
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:16,795
And ever since then, people have reported
seeing the ghost of Madeline O'Malley

230
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:20,496
roaming the hallways
waiting for her lover.

231
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:25,166
Some say, she's even looking
to take up a new one.

232
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:29,094
Excuse me?
What are you doing?

233
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:30,690
Mommy.

234
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:33,203
What's going on?

235
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:36,964
She said there's a ghost in that hotel.
She said it's coming to get me.

236
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,842
- I never said that.
- What's the matter with you?

237
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,689
He's just a child.

238
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,059
Sweetie? Sweetie.

239
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,247
It's okay.
It's not real.

240
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:48,337
It's just a story. Okay?

241
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:50,338
Right? Come here.

242
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,166
I don't need this.
I've enough going on in my life.

243
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,398
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,650
Are you okay?

245
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,826
And you.
We still need towels.

246
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:06,420
I'm tired of asking.
Don't make me the bad guy in this.

247
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,899
Alright.

248
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,390
- We're in the 225.
- Yeah, I know which room you're in.

249
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:13,460
I work in the hotel.

250
00:27:15,194 --> 00:27:18,277
Come on, sweetie.
It's just a silly story, alright?

251
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,573
Okay?

252
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:48,278
I've bought the cheap bread.
I can taste it.

253
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:51,442
Never skimp on bread.
You'll always regret it.

254
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:55,859
So, why do you think she
sticks around here?

255
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,129
Beats me.

256
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,151
The rates aren't that cheap here.

257
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:03,373
"Courtyard by Marriott" on
the route 13 is much better.

258
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,602
No, not her. I mean Madeline.

259
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:07,757
- What do you think she wants?
- I don't know.

260
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:11,855
I don't spend my time trying to figure out
what women want. Specially dead ones.

261
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,285
Please.

262
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:18,539
Well, when you saw her,
what did she look like?

263
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,673
Like she was all dead looking?

264
00:28:20,674 --> 00:28:24,573
The thing about physical encounters is that
you don't really remember the details.

265
00:28:24,574 --> 00:28:27,241
It's weird, cause you think
you would, but, it's like...

266
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:30,505
she was there one minute,
then gone the next.

267
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:33,107
Almost like she was
never in there at all.

268
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:35,874
I know, it's kind of hard to explain,
you just have to be there.

269
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,270
I'm so jealous.

270
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:41,817
But if I saw her,
probably I'd freak out.

271
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:45,891
I can't believe that you
never had your camera with you.

272
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,487
I know. It kills me.

273
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:51,941
Looking down for some recording tonight?

274
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,153
Definitely.

275
00:28:55,154 --> 00:28:58,275
We gotta find some proof that
Madeline O'Malley really exists

276
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:02,436
before this place closes down, we have to.
I mean, imagine how she feels,

277
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,241
being stuck here forever.

278
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:07,946
We gotta get something on tape.

279
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,670
It's like a moral imperative.

280
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:17,577
Oh my God.

281
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:44,977
Shit.

282
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,437
How did you get in there, bird?

283
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:42,177
Luke.

284
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:46,226
Luke, you are not going to believe
what just happened to me.

285
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,179
Luke?

286
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:07,220
What?

287
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:09,081
Never mind.

288
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:13,920
I'm a pumpkin.
I'm gonna kill this snake.

289
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,080
Don't forget to record.

290
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:19,201
I left a list for you on my desk.

291
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:20,878
Okay.

292
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,010
Enjoy your internet porn.

293
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,264
This is EVP recording
of the laundry room.

294
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:09,503
Luke, I'm skipping this one.
There's nothing in here.

295
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,091
This is the EVP recording
of the banquet room.

296
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:36,190
I'm trying to contact the
spirit of Madeline O'Malley.

297
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:41,836
Madeline, if you can hear me,
please give us a sign.

298
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:37,312
Damn it, Luke, you said that
this thing would have been set up.

299
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:33,483
Luke!
Luke, come here, wake up!

300
00:40:34,373 --> 00:40:37,717
- Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up.
- Hold on, hold on.

301
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:39,882
Luke!

302
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:47,328
What the... f?

303
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,616
Claire, I still have
like two hours left, man.

304
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:53,317
Dude, you have to listen to this.
The piano is playing by itself.

305
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,975
I think it was her.

306
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:59,309
Come on, I'll be down at 7:00.
I'll listen to it then.

307
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,059
No, no, I'm scared.

308
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:07,133
Okay, come in.

309
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:10,784
Shit.

310
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:16,988
Actually... I'm...

311
00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:19,845
...okay.

312
00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:24,348
Are you sure?

313
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:29,100
Yeah, I think I just freaked out
for a minute but I'll...

314
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,587
I'll be fine.

315
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:33,586
Okay.

316
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:36,412
Well, I'll be down in
a few hours, alright?

317
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:37,581
Okay.

318
00:41:58,123 --> 00:42:01,041
Do you mind keep it down?

319
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:05,882
Do I have to ask you again?

320
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:11,686
You know what?
Just back off!

321
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,043
Okay?

322
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:16,026
You're asking me "what I do"
the other day?

323
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:19,439
Well, I just recorded an...
unexplainable phenomenon!

324
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,288
There's a ghost in this hotel...

325
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,289
I got it on tape and it's a big deal!
So just... leave me alone!

326
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,406
Come with me for a moment.

327
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:03,560
Here, sit.

328
00:43:09,164 --> 00:43:12,149
You need a drink.

329
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:17,992
Cheers.

330
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:28,182
Are you alright?

331
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:32,374
Tell me about what you saw.

332
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:37,516
- I...
- Look...

333
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,299
I'm sorry about yesterday.

334
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,300
I have a tendency not to be
a nice person, I know that.

335
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:47,058
Please don't take it personally.

336
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:55,234
I don't apologize more than once.

337
00:43:56,084 --> 00:44:00,257
Look, I can help you with
what you're looking for,

338
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:03,197
I just need to know what it is
that you are looking for.

339
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,099
I'm sorry, help me with what?

340
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:21,950
Do you know what this is?

341
00:44:22,614 --> 00:44:25,268
It's a pendulum.

342
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:29,802
It's used to answer life's more...

343
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,093
difficult questions.

344
00:44:36,365 --> 00:44:38,486
Do you know why I'm here?

345
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:41,907
You're speaking at an acting
convention in Pots Town?

346
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:45,798
No, I'm not here for acting.
I am here as a guest...

347
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:48,412
at the Healers Gathering.

348
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:51,502
That's what I do now.
It's my true calling.

349
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:54,991
Claire, everything in this
world is connected.

350
00:44:54,992 --> 00:45:00,417
Whether we understand that or not
depends on our sense of perception.

351
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:02,295
Our willingness to communicate.

352
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:05,196
Now if you wanna communicate
with the spirits in this hotel?

353
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:08,759
I can help you do that.

354
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:13,369
I just need to know what it is
that you want from them.

355
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:19,580
I don't know if they are real.

356
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,820
- The ghosts.
- Spirits.

357
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:29,554
There is no "real" in this world,
Claire, it's all a state of being.

358
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:35,146
There are no beginnings.
There are no ends.

359
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:38,259
There are no ghosts.

360
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:44,516
We're each divine beings that incorporate
one energy in the universe

361
00:45:44,517 --> 00:45:48,916
like uh... droplets of water
in a vast ocean.

362
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:57,061
The universe has a plan for
each and every one of us.

363
00:45:57,765 --> 00:46:03,210
Now, I want you to ignore what
your conscious mind tells you.

364
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:06,233
And open yourself up.

365
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:09,285
Okay?

366
00:46:18,432 --> 00:46:23,613
What is it that you want
from these spirits?

367
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:34,752
I wanna know if it was Madeline O'Malley
playing the piano downstairs.

368
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:41,718
And if she really is the spirit
living in this hotel.

369
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:55,963
Ask again. This time close your
eyes and really concentrate.

370
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:01,449
Open yourself up.

371
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,896
Really ask and ask it directly.

372
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:19,396
Are you the spirit
of Madeline O'Malley?

373
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:23,900
Did you die in this hotel?

374
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:29,731
Was that you playing the piano?

375
00:47:38,131 --> 00:47:40,874
They aren't able
to say who they are.

376
00:47:42,044 --> 00:47:44,164
They?

377
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:47,225
There are three of them.

378
00:47:47,226 --> 00:47:51,253
- What do they want?
- The same thing you do.

379
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:56,290
- What?
- To live.

380
00:47:57,111 --> 00:47:59,922
But they are not alive.

381
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,990
There was a terrible
tragedy in this hotel.

382
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:10,272
Something about the basement.
A mistake.

383
00:48:13,484 --> 00:48:17,419
It's her. It's Madeline.
That's where they hid her body.

384
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:26,137
You mustn't go down into the basement.

385
00:48:26,138 --> 00:48:29,219
Why? Is where she's trapped?
Is her spirit trapped in there?

386
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:38,587
You can't save her.

387
00:48:38,588 --> 00:48:41,620
They tried to warn her.
They tried to help her.

388
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:44,875
Who's they?
What do they want?

389
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,497
What happened?

390
00:48:57,596 --> 00:49:00,904
I lost contact.

391
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:07,886
Luke... No towels.

392
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,689
Luke!

393
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,688
Okay.

394
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:15,913
That's it. I've had enough.
We're going back to dad. Okay?

395
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:41,519
Drink.

396
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:46,881
Don't worry about Gozer and her demon
seed leaving. You actually did us a favour.

397
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,990
Claire, you're really freaking me out.

398
00:52:49,991 --> 00:52:52,997
You gotta pull it together,
you're way out into the weeds right now.

399
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:56,035
It happened to me when I first started
messing around with all this stuff.

400
00:52:56,036 --> 00:52:58,555
You really gotta be careful
about what's going on up here.

401
00:52:58,556 --> 00:53:02,502
You start thinking you're seeing things,
and it might never stop.

402
00:53:02,503 --> 00:53:07,502
Okay, fine. The dream in one thing,
but... what about the piano?

403
00:53:07,913 --> 00:53:11,582
- And what about everything Lee said?
- I listened to that piano tape...

404
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:16,108
and I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe it's explainable, maybe it isn't.

405
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:20,034
But it's not worth getting yourself
worked up over. None of this stuff is.

406
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:25,745
As for the cook upstairs...
Look, Claire...

407
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,794
How many times have you seen
someone on late night TV

408
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:33,222
talking of their psychic awareness to
an audience full of rubes? Tons, right?

409
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:35,958
And how many times have you seen
a psychic in the newspaper

410
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:39,368
solving crimes, or healing
someone without medicine,

411
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:42,263
or winning a lottery.
Almost never, right?

412
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:47,544
That's because is all bullshit.
It's Hocus Pocus.

413
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:50,629
That woman upstairs is just
an insecure old actress.

414
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,990
She's just trying to stay relevant.
It's pathetic.

415
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:56,991
Okay.

416
00:53:57,346 --> 00:54:00,762
Don't you wanna try to figure out
what's going on here?

417
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:05,400
Why are you not intrigued by this?
I mean, this could be it.

418
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:09,706
This could be Madeline trying to make
contact and you just don't even care.

419
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:12,683
Isn't this supposed to be your deal?

420
00:54:15,498 --> 00:54:18,736
I swear to God, if that bitch
is back with her kid...

421
00:54:21,898 --> 00:54:24,423
Be cool.

422
00:54:25,877 --> 00:54:27,202
Can I help you, sir?

423
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:30,903
Yes, I'd like a room for the night,
please.

424
00:54:31,203 --> 00:54:34,651
- Okay, just one night?
- Yes.

425
00:54:34,652 --> 00:54:39,695
I'd like room 353, please.

426
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:43,548
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
That room is not available right now.

427
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:46,125
We only have rooms available
on the second floor...

428
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:48,824
because this will be
our last weekend open.

429
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:50,547
No...

430
00:54:51,048 --> 00:54:57,748
I must have room
3... 5... 3.

431
00:54:58,592 --> 00:55:01,841
- Yeah.
- Please.

432
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:12,223
This is very important to me.

433
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:19,694
I came a long way.

434
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:26,441
Sir, all the rooms on the third
floor have been stripped, so...

435
00:55:27,148 --> 00:55:29,524
if you don't mind
putting up some sheets

436
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:34,565
and sleeping in a room without furniture,
then, I think we can help you out.

437
00:55:36,908 --> 00:55:39,970
That would be fine.

438
00:55:42,196 --> 00:55:45,862
Okay, well, if I could just get a
credit card for the reservation?

439
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,123
I'll pay cash.

440
00:55:50,124 --> 00:55:54,138
Okay, but we usually need a credit
card in cases of any damages...

441
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,848
Take these, please.

442
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:04,991
Okay.

443
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:10,348
Let's... go get you some sheets.

444
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:18,578
Have a nice day.

445
00:56:23,837 --> 00:56:27,308
That's very kind of you
helping me out back here.

446
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:29,532
Oh, It's no problem.
I mean, I figure...

447
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:32,033
pretty soon this whole place
will be a parking lot, anyway.

448
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:36,892
So, if somebody wants a certain room,
who am I to stop 'em?

449
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:43,380
It's really no big deal.

450
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:47,988
Sir?

451
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:04,109
Oh, thank you.

452
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:09,144
353 is where I spent my honeymoon.

453
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:15,148
This old place holds some
special memories for me.

454
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:18,949
And It's interesting,
come back to a place

455
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,278
feels like you never left.

456
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:27,111
Almost like you're right at home.

457
00:57:27,768 --> 00:57:31,785
- Don't you think?
- I don't know.

458
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:36,097
Why don't we take them upstairs?

459
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:54,515
So, like we said, the rooms have all
been cleaned and stripped, and...

460
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:57,061
most of the furniture and
linen are in the storage.

461
00:57:57,062 --> 00:58:00,926
But, lucky for you, the owner is
too cheap to hire real movers,

462
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:02,427
so all the beds are still here.

463
00:58:04,057 --> 00:58:07,468
The room might not have quite
the same charm that you remember,

464
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:09,108
but at least
you wont be sleep on the floor.

465
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:10,509
That's alright.

466
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:15,401
I'm just here for one
last bit of nostalgia.

467
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:19,314
Okay. Well, here we are.
Room 353.

468
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:23,263
"Honeymoon Suite".

469
00:58:34,393 --> 00:58:36,209
And, uh...
if you change your mind...

470
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,910
and decide that you wanna move
to a room with TV, just let us know.

471
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:46,725
That won't be necessary.

472
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:50,728
This is just what I came for.

473
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:06,645
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, well, enjoy your stay.

474
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:35,621
If I wanna stay up all night with you,
you gotta get drunk with me.

475
00:59:37,214 --> 00:59:40,163
Cheers.

476
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:48,746
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

477
00:59:48,747 --> 00:59:52,324
Good. Keep drinking.
That always helps.

478
01:00:01,193 --> 01:00:03,494
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi.

479
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:06,362
- How was your seminar?
- Very good, thank you.

480
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,199
- How are you two doing?
- Not bad.

481
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,512
- Do you want a beer?
- No, thank you.

482
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:15,350
Really? I heard you're
a huge drinker.

483
01:00:18,378 --> 01:00:21,584
Well, we all have our moments.

484
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:25,597
So, Lee, tell me,
how does it all work?

485
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,918
- How does what work?
- You know, being a psychic and all.

486
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,094
Well...

487
01:00:37,187 --> 01:00:41,496
Have you ever been
somewhere new and sworn

488
01:00:41,497 --> 01:00:44,628
- that you've been there before?
- Like a deja vu.

489
01:00:44,629 --> 01:00:46,882
Exactly.

490
01:00:46,883 --> 01:00:50,095
Well, if you've ever experienced
what you call a deja vu,

491
01:00:50,096 --> 01:00:53,049
then you have the same
God-given ability I have.

492
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:59,013
In fact, we all do.
It's just that...

493
01:00:59,014 --> 01:01:02,608
Sometimes my deja vu's happening
in another direction.

494
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:06,876
I can experience certain
feelings before they happen.

495
01:01:06,877 --> 01:01:10,309
It's not always clear when or
where they come from.

496
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,637
So I have to be very careful in...

497
01:01:13,222 --> 01:01:16,222
what I choose to share.

498
01:01:18,096 --> 01:01:19,516
Okay.

499
01:01:24,282 --> 01:01:30,080
I'm really tired, so I'm gonna go upstairs
and go to sleep. It's been a long day.

500
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:33,663
I'll come find you tomorrow
before you leave. Lee.

501
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,573
Don't let the spirits
keep you up all night.

502
01:01:44,249 --> 01:01:48,304
Dude, you don't need to say that.
That was really mean.

503
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:52,669
Oh, whatever. You said it yourself.
She made you feel like an asshole.

504
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:58,216
Besides, everybody needs a taste of
their own medicine once in a while.

505
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,422
- Do you want another one?
- Yeah.

506
01:02:25,063 --> 01:02:28,537
- Alright, are you ready?
- Yeah.

507
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:39,007
Okay, this is Claire's haunted
re-enactment. Take one.

508
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:43,601
Interior. Yankee pedophile.

509
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:55,381
Was that the piano?

510
01:03:20,651 --> 01:03:23,071
What?

511
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:27,445
Is it playing by itself?

512
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:33,181
It must be the ghost of Madeline O'Malley
trying to tell me something.

513
01:03:36,795 --> 01:03:40,079
Show yourself, spirit.

514
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:45,124
I said, show yourself, spirit!

515
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:26,848
There she is.

516
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:30,888
Poor, poor, Madeline O'Malley.

517
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:41,575
Do you think she's prettier than me?

518
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:43,970
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

519
01:04:43,971 --> 01:04:46,715
She's a little homely for my taste.

520
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,843
I think you're much prettier, Claire.

521
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,937
Thank you.
That's nice of you to say.

522
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:57,724
In fact, Claire, I think you are
one of the prettiest girls I know.

523
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:02,572
Who are the others?

524
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:07,071
My mother, my sister...

525
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:10,568
and that girl who works
at the Dirty Queen.

526
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:15,853
- The one with the lazy eye?
- I find laziness very attractive.

527
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:24,037
- I really like you, Claire.
- I really like you too.

528
01:05:24,072 --> 01:05:27,956
No, I mean it. You're just like
the coolest person. I Just...

529
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:31,747
I Just really feel like we match.

530
01:05:33,793 --> 01:05:38,167
You know, I'd love the fact that
you support me with the website and...

531
01:05:38,825 --> 01:05:42,229
I just love the fact that
you take me seriously.

532
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,751
It means a lot.
You're great.

533
01:05:46,325 --> 01:05:48,866
Do you think
I'm going a little bit crazy?

534
01:05:48,867 --> 01:05:50,467
You're not going crazy.

535
01:05:50,567 --> 01:05:55,283
You are great.
I would do anything for you.

536
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,493
- Really?
- Absolutely.

537
01:05:58,494 --> 01:06:03,390
Just...
I like you so much.

538
01:06:09,745 --> 01:06:12,132
Hey, I have an idea.

539
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:16,839
Me too. What's yours?

540
01:06:30,781 --> 01:06:35,638
Let's go to the basement, and find out
what the fucking ghost problem is.

541
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,899
Okay.

542
01:07:36,668 --> 01:07:39,542
That's a good omen.

543
01:07:41,548 --> 01:07:44,400
Turn the recorder on.

544
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:32,332
What was that?

545
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:35,003
I tripped.

546
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:48,943
Sorry.
It's just the lighting.

547
01:08:48,944 --> 01:08:53,047
- A spider web.
- Follow me.

548
01:09:15,674 --> 01:09:18,903
I'm starting to think we should
have brought breadcrumbs.

549
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:22,854
Hang on.

550
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:25,202
Hear something.

551
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:35,569
It's weird. You're static.

552
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:40,453
- I heard that too the other night.
- Must be a bad cable.

553
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:44,744
No, it's her.

554
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,947
This way.

555
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,947
This is it.
This is where they hid her body.

556
01:10:58,749 --> 01:11:01,630
Are you ready?

557
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:11,498
We wish to speak to the spirit
of Madeline O'Malley.

558
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:16,860
If you're here with us,
give us a sign.

559
01:11:38,022 --> 01:11:40,869
Make noise if you can hear us.

560
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,597
Why do you stay here, Madeline?

561
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:56,139
Why did your spirit never rest?

562
01:12:21,362 --> 01:12:23,823
Madeline, give us a sign.

563
01:12:31,567 --> 01:12:34,920
Did you feel that?

564
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:43,604
It's her.

565
01:12:44,164 --> 01:12:47,477
- That was the wind.
- No, she is with us right now.

566
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:58,202
Madeline, speak to us.
We wish you no harm.

567
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,282
Why do you stay here?

568
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,748
Why did your spirit never rest?

569
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:32,570
Wait, no. Madeline, we know that you are
here with us right now. Speak to us.

570
01:13:57,518 --> 01:14:00,572
I can hear her.

571
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:08,604
Do you hear the whispering?

572
01:14:19,203 --> 01:14:21,003
Madeline?

573
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:34,302
Holy shit.

574
01:14:39,103 --> 01:14:41,597
What?

575
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:50,604
She's right behind you.

576
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:59,945
She's coming closer.

577
01:15:04,103 --> 01:15:05,374
Luke!

578
01:15:18,604 --> 01:15:20,105
Luke!

579
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,649
- I gotta get out of here.
- What?

580
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,779
I don't wanna be here anymore.
I don't like this.

581
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,804
What are you talking about?
We just made a physical contact.

582
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:30,046
Why are you freaking out?

583
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:32,607
I just don't wanna be here anymore.
That's it.

584
01:15:32,855 --> 01:15:34,690
Why? Was it different from the
other times that you saw her?

585
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:38,309
- There were no other times.
- What?

586
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:43,629
I made it up.
I never saw anything.

587
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,809
I made it all up. I don't want
anything to do with this anymore.

588
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,735
This is just too fucked up.

589
01:15:51,736 --> 01:15:54,566
I gotta go.

590
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:55,874
Luke!

591
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:03,477
- Luke, don't go!
- I'm sorry, Claire.

592
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:06,825
- You can't leave me here.
- I'm really sorry.

593
01:16:19,173 --> 01:16:22,943
What am I gonna do now?

594
01:17:08,005 --> 01:17:09,556
Lee?

595
01:17:11,705 --> 01:17:13,404
Lee!

596
01:17:17,105 --> 01:17:18,406
Lee.

597
01:17:19,555 --> 01:17:20,791
Lee! Lee.

598
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:24,288
Lee, wake up. I need your help.
Help me.

599
01:17:24,805 --> 01:17:26,104
Lee!

600
01:17:31,471 --> 01:17:34,373
What are you doing in my room?

601
01:17:34,374 --> 01:17:37,632
- Get out of here.
- No. No, please. Plaese. Please.

602
01:17:37,633 --> 01:17:41,116
No, I will not help you.
Please go away.

603
01:17:41,117 --> 01:17:43,799
Come on.

604
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,977
Why should I help you?
So you can make fun of me some more?

605
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:51,153
You know, I believe in what I do.

606
01:17:51,154 --> 01:17:56,128
And I don't believe in wasting my time
on lonely hotel employees and their

607
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:58,867
insulting ignorance.

608
01:17:58,868 --> 01:18:03,266
Lee, I'm sorry, okay?
I should've defended you downstairs...

609
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:04,819
and I made a really big mistake,
okay?

610
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,520
But I have a problem.
I'm scared, I'm alone,

611
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:11,605
and Madeline made contact with me,
and I don't know what else to do, okay?

612
01:18:11,606 --> 01:18:13,726
I don't know what else to do!

613
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:36,908
- Is there anymore vodka over there?
- I'll check.

614
01:18:40,998 --> 01:18:43,425
Here, take this one.

615
01:18:49,656 --> 01:18:51,306
Okay.

616
01:18:52,633 --> 01:18:55,947
Take me to where it happened.

617
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:06,106
Wait here.

618
01:20:38,775 --> 01:20:41,460
Lee! Was it Madeline?
Did you see her?

619
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:45,043
- Lee, what happened?
- We must get out of this hotel.

620
01:20:45,044 --> 01:20:48,000
You're in great danger.
You can't stay here any longer.

621
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,298
- What?
- I have to go get dressed.

622
01:20:50,299 --> 01:20:53,157
Go get your things.
Trust me.

623
01:21:14,109 --> 01:21:15,508
Oh, no.

624
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:22,745
Lee! I forgot something.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

625
01:21:38,624 --> 01:21:40,120
Sir?

626
01:21:46,858 --> 01:21:49,107
Sir?

627
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,307
Sir, I'm sorry that
I'm disturbing you, but...

628
01:21:56,308 --> 01:21:59,308
there has been an emergency and I have
to leave the hotel for a little bit.

629
01:22:06,456 --> 01:22:09,693
Sir, can you hear me in there?

630
01:22:19,409 --> 01:22:22,694
MY DARLING, THIS IS WHERE OUR
LIFE BEGAN. NOW THAT YOU ARE GONE,

631
01:22:22,695 --> 01:22:26,409
THIS IS WHERE I WANT MINE TO END.

632
01:22:43,676 --> 01:22:46,184
Sir?

633
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:56,809
Holy shit!

634
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:59,209
- Luke? What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

635
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,798
I should have not left you like that.

636
01:24:00,799 --> 01:24:02,210
- Please don't be mad at me.
- No no no, listen.

637
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:03,585
- We need to get out of here right now.
- No no no, Claire...

638
01:24:03,586 --> 01:24:06,609
- I have to tell you something.
- No! Listen to me, okay?

639
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:07,954
- Remember that old man upstairs?
- Yeah!

640
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:10,717
- Yes, so what?
- He's dead. He killed himself. He's dead.

641
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:14,849
- What?
- Yeah, he's dead.

642
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:17,941
- Did you call the police?
- No, not yet.

643
01:24:17,942 --> 01:24:21,045
Lee... Lee said that it's no safe
to be here anymore,

644
01:24:21,046 --> 01:24:22,346
and we need to leave right now.

645
01:24:22,446 --> 01:24:25,104
- And I saw Madeline...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait a second.

646
01:24:25,105 --> 01:24:27,304
Hold on, hold on. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

647
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:29,772
come here.
Jesus Christ.

648
01:24:30,852 --> 01:24:32,613
Here, sit down.

649
01:24:35,509 --> 01:24:38,598
It's alright.

650
01:24:39,849 --> 01:24:43,409
His face...
There was blood everywhere.

651
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:45,264
It's okay.

652
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:49,327
Please, please, please,
just get me out of here.

653
01:24:49,328 --> 01:24:50,828
I don't wanna be here anymore.
Please.

654
01:24:51,028 --> 01:24:54,101
- Alright. Okay. Come on, let's go.
- Lee, she's still upstairs.

655
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:56,785
- Where is she?
- I don't know, she's getting her things.

656
01:24:56,786 --> 01:24:58,810
Alright, I'll go get her, and
you just stay put for a second.

657
01:24:58,811 --> 01:25:00,610
Are you gonna be alright
down here for a minute?

658
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:01,517
Yeah.

659
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:03,609
It's fine. It's gonna be okay.
Just hold on.

660
01:25:17,309 --> 01:25:18,810
<i>Claire.</i>

661
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:27,510
<i>Claire.</i>

662
01:25:38,156 --> 01:25:41,684
Lee, is that you?

663
01:26:30,061 --> 01:26:31,511
Lee?

664
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:15,511
Lee?

665
01:27:21,011 --> 01:27:22,512
Lee?

666
01:27:25,511 --> 01:27:28,981
I don't wanna go back down there.

667
01:27:40,861 --> 01:27:44,202
Are you down there?

668
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:48,719
Please, somebody help me!
Luke!

669
01:30:02,984 --> 01:30:04,575
Please!

670
01:30:04,576 --> 01:30:08,287
Somebody help me!
Please!

671
01:30:08,288 --> 01:30:12,593
Please, help me! Please!
Please, no! No, please!

672
01:30:46,855 --> 01:30:49,875
Alright, guys, hold her up.
Hold her up.

673
01:30:56,065 --> 01:30:57,413
Jesus.

674
01:31:00,963 --> 01:31:03,638
Alright, get her out of here.

675
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:18,623
I was banging on the door
as hard as I could.

676
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:22,829
I could hear her screaming.

677
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:26,447
I was screaming for her
to open up, but she wouldn't.

678
01:31:29,247 --> 01:31:34,259
She called my name, but I wasn't
strong enough to break it down.

679
01:31:39,037 --> 01:31:42,914
This was at the bottom of the stairs.

680
01:31:44,992 --> 01:31:48,020
Alright, listen to me.
I need you to come with us,

681
01:31:48,021 --> 01:31:50,304
and answer some questions
about the gentleman upstairs.

682
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:54,629
And help getting contact with
her family. Can you do that?

683
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:57,109
- Yeah, I just gotta get my stuff.
- Okay.

684
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:58,849
You think you can tell the actress
to hurry up...

685
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,350
while you're in there?
We need her too.

686
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,365
Yeah.

687
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:04,415
Oh, listen...

688
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:07,386
Are you sure you gave me all the names
and numbers of the other guests?

689
01:32:07,387 --> 01:32:09,459
Nobody I might be forgetting?

690
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:13,773
No, I gave you everything. There was
just the other woman with her kid and...

691
01:32:13,774 --> 01:32:18,276
Ron the owner, but he doesn't get back
from Barbados till tomorrow.

692
01:32:19,544 --> 01:32:21,914
Alright, thanks.

693
01:33:48,064 --> 01:33:51,417
What are you doing in here?

694
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:56,703
They're looking for you downstairs,
I said I'd find you.

695
01:33:56,704 --> 01:34:01,559
We have to go to the police station
and answer to some more questions.

696
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:10,423
Did you hear me?
I said we have to go.

697
01:34:16,869 --> 01:34:20,044
You knew this was gonna
happen, didn't you?

698
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:25,618
You could've done something.

699
01:34:28,792 --> 01:34:33,162
No. There's nothing anyone
could have done.

700
01:34:38,703 --> 01:34:40,761
They're looking for you downstairs.
