1
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,287
<i> EVERYTHING IS SO DIFFICULT.</i>

2
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,023
           <i> I JUST--</i>

3
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,394
<i> OVER THERE.</i>

4
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,595
<i> SYLVIA--</i>

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,672
<i> MY GOODNESS.</i>

6
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:34,393
     <i> MARCELLO, COME HERE.</i>

7
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,095
           <i> HURRY UP.</i>

8
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,859
<i> SYLVIA...</i>

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,501
<i> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MONDAY?</i>

10
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:18,871
   <i> ...IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE</i>
   <i> TAKEN OFF LAST MONDAY...</i>

11
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,475
   WELL, BECAUSE MY FATHER'S
   ARRIVING TODAY.

12
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,812
     NO, I TOLD YOU
     I CANNOT DO MONDAY...

13
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,447
       I'M NOT AFRAID
       TO GET OFF MYSELF.

14
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,216
       HEY, BE CAREFUL
       WITH THAT MIRROR!

15
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,785
COULD YOU TAKE DOWN
THE "FOR SALE" SIGN
ON THE WINDOWS UPSTAIRS, PLEASE?

16
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,287
      THEY'RE ALL THE WAY
      ON THE THIRD FLOOR, MA'AM.

17
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,488
               HOW AM I SUPPOSED
               TO DO THAT?

18
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,890
WELL, I'M NOT A SUPER,
AM I?

19
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,892
THAT GOES RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

20
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,194
          TACO, GET ME A LADDER.

21
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,563
        YEAH, I KNOW.
        I HATE LADDERS.

22
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:45,797
  I'M ALWAYS FALLING OFF THEM,

23
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,699
      BUT THIS WOMAN
      IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

24
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,903
ARMANDE, IS THAT THE WOMAN
WHO'S MOVING IN NEXT DOOR TO ME?

25
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,471
NO, SHE'S NOT THE WOMAN
WHO'S MOVING IN.

26
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,939
THANK GOD
SHE LIVES IN THE SUBURBS.

27
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,440
    IT'S HER FATHER.

28
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,643
HER MOTHER PASSED AWAY,
SHE WANTS HIM NEARBY.

29
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,912
               OH, WHAT A SHAME.
          YEAH.

30
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,667
                    HEY!

31
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,204
                HEY!

32
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,313
      OKAY, GOOD.

33
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,814
                     SO, UH,
                     COME ON IN.

34
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,384
  IF YOU WANT TO, UH,
  CHANGE INTO YOUR WORK CLOTHES,

35
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,253
            YOU CAN USE THE ROOM
            RIGHT BACK THERE.

36
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,355
    I'M ALREADY IN
    MY WORK CLOTHES.

37
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,959
              OKAY. OKAY, GREAT.
              UM, ALL RIGHT.

38
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,995
     REMEMBER, MY FATHER'S GOING
     TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE NOW.

39
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,799
THIS IS MOVE
     IS ENTIRELY POINTLESS.

40
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,367
        I WAS DOING FINE
        IN MY OWN HOME.

41
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,802
  THIS IS YOUR OWN HOME, FRED.

42
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,403
  YOUR DAUGHTER MOVED YOU HERE
  FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

43
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,305
  WHAT DOES MY DAUGHTER KNOW?

44
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,242
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S FOR
MY OWN GOOD. HOW DOES SHE KNOW?

45
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,743
THAT'LL BE $9.80.

46
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,878
    DO YOU GOT A TEN?
    I ONLY CARRY BIG BILLS.

47
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,288
                 FRED.

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,258
      IT'S APARTMENT 3-D.

49
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,730
             WHAT?!

50
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,734
   SO, MICHAEL, DO YOU THINK
   THAT IT LOOKS BETTER HERE,

51
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,372
     OR DOES IT LOOK BETTER
     OVER HERE?

52
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,607
              SO?

53
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,343
DID GRANDMA LOOK THAT PISSED OFF
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG, TOO?

54
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,048
       WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAR?

55
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,816
     WERE YOU GUYS GOING TO EVER
     ANSWER YOUR CELL PHONE?

56
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,985
            WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
IT TOOK ME TWO HOURS
TO CONVINCE HIM.

57
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,554
HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME.
HE'S STUBBORN AS A MULE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR?

58
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,555
      I DON'T KNOW
      WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

59
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,723
COME HERE.
COME OVER HERE.

60
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,824
    I LEFT IT WITH YOU
    FOR ONE HOUR, LYDIA.

61
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,459
ONE HOUR. LOOK AT THIS.
COME HERE.

62
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,962
   ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
   IT IS NOT YOUR CAR.

63
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,431
            IT'S MY CAR, TOO.
  LOOK AT IT.

64
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,567
                OH, MY GOD.
                WHO DID THAT?
YOU'VE WRECKED MY CAR.

65
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,903
I LEFT THAT CAR
WITH YOU FOR ONE HOUR,
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

66
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,307
       I'M LAVERNE.
       NICE TO MEET YOU.

67
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,441
          WHO ARE YOU,
          EXACTLY?

68
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,942
            MAYBE JUST
            SOMEBODY PASSING BY.

69
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,811
          IT WAS AN OLD LADY
          IN AN ORANGE CAR.

70
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,881
            WHAT? WHAT OLD LADY?

71
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,649
<i> ¶ JUST SHAKE IT, SHAKE IT</i>
   <i> SHAKE IT, SHAKE IT ¶</i>

72
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,551
<i> ¶ SHAKE THAT LITTLE MAMACITA ¶</i>

73
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,620
 <i> ¶ SHAKE IT, LICK IT, LICK IT,</i>
 <i> LICK IT, LICK IT ¶</i>

74
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,323
      <i> ¶ OOH, OOH-OOH ¶</i>

75
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,324
       <i> ¶ GET IT, GIRL ¶</i>

76
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,359
        <i> ¶ OOH-OOH, OOH ¶</i>

77
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,960
    <i> ¶ GET, GET IT,</i>
    <i> GET IT, GET IT, GIRL ¶</i>

78
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,463
    YEAH, WHO IS THIS WOMAN?

79
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,031
AH. AH, YES.

80
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,433
THAT'S, UH, LAVERNE.

81
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,801
I FOUND HER HERE,

82
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,070
AND, IT TURNS OUT
SHE'S WONDERFUL.

83
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,838
               WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
               YOU FOUND HER?

84
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,541
          THE PEOPLE
          WHO LIVED HERE BEFORE,
          LEFT HER HERE?

85
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,544
OH, NO. AROUND HERE.
SHE LIVES NEARBY.

86
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,447
     OH, OKAY. THAT MEANS
     SHE'S GOING BACK HOME, NOW.

87
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,849
UH, WELL, UH, YES,
BUT MAYBE SOMETIMES

88
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,050
SHE'LL COME BACK
TO KEEP YOU COMPANY.

89
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,552
               HUH, "COME BACK".

90
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,654
      THIS IS A HOME CAREGIVER--

91
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,856
                 UH, SORRY.
                 UH, NO OFFENSE.

92
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,991
    YOU WOULDN'T, BY ANY CHANCE,
    BE CONFUSING ME

93
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,994
              WITH SOME ELDERLY,
              MENTAL DEFECTIVE?

94
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,497
         I CAN LOOK AFTER MYSELF
         VERY WELL, THANK YOU,

95
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,633
BUT I CANNOT HAVE
A RANDOM PERSON IN THE HOUSE.

96
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,536
            BUT DAD, YOU CAN'T
            DO EVERYTHING ALONE.

97
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,105
                 I'LL WORRY.

98
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,941
AND I HAVE TO BE STRESSED OUT
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY?

99
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,744
      SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
      TO BE OFFENSIVE.

100
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,679
BUT I WILL NOT
HAVE THAT WOMAN

101
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,147
WANDERING ALL OVER
MY HOUSE!

102
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,483
                  OH, HEY! OKAY.

103
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,017
            WE'LL SEND HER AWAY,

104
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,053
                 BUT YOU HAVE
                 TO GO TELL HER.

105
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,654
   NO PROBLEM.

106
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:34,926
NOW, NOW, LISTEN.

107
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,561
YOU LOOK HERE, NOW.

108
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,397
                  I ALREADY QUIT
                  MY OTHER JOB.

109
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,600
              WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
              TO DO NOW?

110
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,001
WELL, I DON'T--

111
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,903
I MEAN--

112
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,975
<i> DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE LATE.</i>

113
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:53,111
       NO, I'M ON MY WAY.

114
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,479
       MOM, I POSTPONED
       A MEETING AT WORK

115
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,547
       TO GO IN WITH YOU.

116
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,149
<i>OH, DEAR, SWEET, WONDERFUL SON.</i>

117
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,884
       OH, YOU SHOULDN'T
       HAVE DONE THAT.

118
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,853
      I TOLD YOU
      I CAN GO BY MYSELF.

119
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,655
     I KNOW THE WHOLE DEAL
     BY NOW.

120
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,956
      THEY KNOW ME THERE.
      I KNOW THEM.

121
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,992
         MOM, I WORRY.

122
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,693
      IF I HAVE A PROBLEM,

123
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,864
   I'LL CALL YOU AND YOU CAN
   COME AND PICK ME UP.

124
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,033
NO, NO. NOT THE BOOKS.
     I'LL DO THOSE, HONEST.

125
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,803
             WELL, THAT MEANS
             I'M GOING TO DO IT.

126
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,604
NOW, LOOK.
LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.

127
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,741
I'LL STAY OFF YOUR BACK
IF YOU STAY OFF MINE.

128
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,776
                   FINE WITH ME.

129
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,511
  WHAT DOES "STAY OFF YOUR BACK"
  MEAN TO YOU?

130
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,680
WELL, IT MEANS IF YOU WANT
TO KEEP WORKING HERE,

131
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,650
ANYTHING MY DAUGHTER TELLS YOU
TO DO, YOU DON'T DO.

132
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,453
 WELL, I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE
 OF ALL YOUR NEEDS.

133
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,621
COOKING AND CLEANING,
THAT'S OKAY.

134
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,790
I DON'T LIKE THAT MUCH,

135
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,226
BUT WHAT ELSE
DID SHE TELL YOU TO DO?

136
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,894
          UH, MAKE YOU TAKE
          A WALK IN THE MORNING,

137
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,095
               AND AGAIN
               IN THE AFTERNOON.

138
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,097
LIKE A DOG?
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

139
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,466
                  AND THEN...

140
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,034
   THEN WHAT?

141
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:52,037
       TO MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE
       YOUR UNDERWEAR EVERY DAY.

142
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,606
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?
                            YES.

143
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,109
   A BABY GIRL. SHE LIVES
   IN PITTSBURGH WITH MY SISTER.

144
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,580
YEAH, NO. I CAN'T SEE THAT.
I HAVEN'T GOT MY GLASSES.

145
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:04,216
JUST ENJOY HER
WHILE SHE'S STILL SMALL...

146
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:08,119
AND HASN'T PICKED
SOME IDIOT TO MARRY.

147
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,255
UH! AND THAT
MUST NOT BE TOUCHED.

148
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,523
DAD?

149
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,657
         DAD, I'M BACK.

150
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,126
         HI. GOT PIZZA.

151
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,797
    AND AS OF TOMORROW,
    YOU BUY GROCERIES, OKAY?

152
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,933
  WELL, YOU SHOULD REALLY GO FOR
  A WALK IN THE PARK, DAD.

153
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,035
              IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

154
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,237
                ARE YOU FEELING
                BETTER NOW, MOM?

155
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,838
                   NO, I'M FINE.

156
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,039
                    I'M PERFECT.

157
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,608
               I ONLY CALLED YOU
               BECAUSE I KNEW

158
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,010
      YOU WERE GOING TO CALL ME.

159
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,912
            WHAT'S LIFE
            WITHOUT YOUR MOTHER?

160
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,250
                THANK YOU, DEAR.

161
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,221
                  GOOD EVENING.
         GOOD EVENING.

162
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,222
         EVENING.

163
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,290
                        EVENING.

164
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,260
         COME ON.
         MOVE IT, MIKE.

165
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,928
UM...

166
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,830
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

167
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,032
             YES. INSIDE, FIRST.
             TALK LATER.

168
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,235
I, UH, GOT
THE BANK STATEMENT TODAY,

169
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,970
AND IT SHOWS
A CASH WITHDRAWAL.

170
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,072
WHAT DID YOU NEED
THAT MONEY FOR?

171
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,143
    OH, GOD, IS IT COLD IN HERE,
    OR IS IT ME?

172
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,711
               DON'T CHANGE
               THE SUBJECT, MOM.

173
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,313
           I JUST WANT TO KNOW
           WHAT YOU SPENT IT ON.

174
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:12,017
OH, LIVING. WHAT ELSE
WOULD I SPEND IT ON, DEAR?

175
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,752
     WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $2,000.

176
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,654
WOULD YOU LIKE
THE CARD BACK?

177
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,622
       IT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

178
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,891
           I JUST WANT TO KNOW
           WHAT YOU SPENT IT ON.

179
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,028
             WELL, ARE YOU GOING
             TO STAY FOR DINNER?

180
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,863
                     BECAUSE I--
    ANSWER ME.

181
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:25,997
                           WHAT?

182
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,333
YOU HELPING ALEC OUT AGAIN?

183
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,102
          NO. NOW, WHAT HAS ALEC
          GOT TO DO WITH IT?

184
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,904
      HE'S YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER.

185
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,106
YOU'VE ALWAYS BLAMED HIM.

186
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,176
            I THINK THAT
            I'D BETTER GET THAT.

187
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,247
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

188
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,250
NOT ONLY DID YOU DAMAGE OUR CAR,
BUT YOU THREATENED A MINOR.

189
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,118
DO YOU KNOW THAT
THAT'S A FELONY?

190
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,922
  WELL, I'VE NEVER EVEN SET EYES
  ON THIS PARTICULAR MINOR.

191
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:51,990
        WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

192
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:52,991
                    SHE'S CRAZY.

193
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,327
I AM CERTAINLY NOT CRAZY.

194
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,329
THIS AFTERNOON--
IS SHE YOUR MOTHER?

195
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,297
             NO.
               YES. YES, SHE IS.
               PLEASE, JUST--

196
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,232
OKAY.
THIS AFTERNOON,

197
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,702
YOUR MOTHER
RAMMED INTO OUR CAR,

198
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,171
AND THEN SHE DROVE OFF WITHOUT
LEAVING SO MUCH AS A NOTE.

199
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,907
  OH, WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
  IT'S NOT TRUE.

200
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,208
OH, REALLY?

201
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,144
OKAY, YOU HAVE
AN ORANGE CAR, AM I RIGHT?

202
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,046
           WELL, NO.
                          MOM.

203
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,715
MY SON SAW
THE WHOLE THING.

204
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,685
WILL YOU STOP
THREATENING MY SON?

205
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,886
          OKAY, MA'AM,
          PLEASE JUST CALM DOWN.

206
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,088
        MY MOTHER'S AN OLD LADY.

207
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,156
I'LL CALM DOWN
ONCE I GET HER

208
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,725
FULL INSURANCE DETAILS.

209
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,194
          OKAY. MOM, GO GET
          YOUR INSURANCE PAPERS.

210
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,929
         NO, I CAN'T.
                        WHY NOT?

211
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,731
       BECAUSE I HADN'T
       MADE THE PAYMENT.

212
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,232
            AH! GOD.
      OH!

213
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,034
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT
YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND

214
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,102
WITH NO INSURANCE?

215
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,870
YOU COULD HAVE
KILLED SOMEBODY.

216
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,372
          BUT I DIDN'T
          KILL ANYONE.

217
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:41,773
     IT'S JUST A HEADLIGHT.

218
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,842
        TWO HEADLIGHTS,
        AND A FENDER.

219
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,210
         ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
         I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

220
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,311
           JUST GET AN ESTIMATE,
           AND GIVE ME A CALL.

221
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,345
OKAY.
                  OKAY.

222
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,847
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
                THANK YOU.

223
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,081
DRIVE OFF IN A HEAT.

224
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,384
                    MOM--

225
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,187
TWO LOUSY HEADLIGHTS,
AND THEN,

226
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,189
"MY MOTHER IS AN OLD LADY."

227
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,258
YOU COULD HAVE KEPT THAT ONE
TO YOURSELF, DEAR.

228
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,027
              PLEASE, I WAS
              JUST SAYING THAT--

229
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,662
IF THAT WOMAN
PARKED HER CAR

230
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,064
RIGHT NEXT TO ME,
RIGHT UP AGAINST ME,

231
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,333
WHAT HAS MY AGE
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

232
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,035
I MEAN, IF I WAS 20,
WOULD THAT MEAN

233
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,336
SHE WOULDN'T PARK THERE?

234
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,904
   WHEN SHE CALLS WITH THE BILL,

235
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:16,041
               I WILL TELL YOU
               THE EXACT AMOUNT.

236
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:19,678
         NOW, I'M GOING TO LEAVE
         THE CHECK BLANK, OKAY?

237
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,146
             YOU JUST FILL IT IN
             AND GIVE IT TO HER.

238
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,214
   I DON'T KNOW
   WHERE SHE LIVES.

239
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,416
     ISN'T SHE THE NEW NEIGHBOR?

240
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,051
NO, THAT'S HER FATHER.

241
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,153
            OKAY, SO, ALL RIGHT.
            GIVE IT TO HIM.

242
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,821
                 WHAT'S HE LIKE?

243
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,322
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM.

244
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,092
<i> HELLO?</i>

245
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,359

        WHY WEREN'T YOU
        PICKING UP?

247
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,262
       <i> BECAUSE I KNEW</i>
       <i> IT WAS YOU, DEAR.</i>

248
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,298
         THANKS.
         ARE YOU OKAY?

249
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,299
          OH, PEACHY.

250
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,034
        ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

251
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,170
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S DAUGHTER
CALLED WITH A QUOTE FOR THE CAR.

252
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,739
            $1,500.

253
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,440
          $1,500?

254
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,942
     WAIT, WELL,
     LET ME SPEAK TO THEM.

255
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:24,943
          <i> NO, NO, NO.</i>

256
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,277
      NO. LET IT GO, OKAY?

257
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,179
      JUST WRITE THE CHECK
      AND FORGET ABOUT IT.

258
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,849
      OH, AND NOT
      THIS COMING SUNDAY,

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,226
       WELL, I WAS AWAY.

265
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,061
     I HAD SOMETHING TO DO.
     I DON'T REMEMBER.

00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,985
  $1,500.

294
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,020
                      I'M SORRY,

295
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,855
          WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

296
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,091
WELL, TWO HEADLIGHTS
SHOULD NOT COST $1,500.

297
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,594
I MEAN, I COULD--
I COULD FEED MY GRANDCHILDREN

298
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,530
FOR A MONTH,
OR MAYBE TWO, ON THIS.

299
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:56,301
FIVE CHILDREN
AND WIDOWED FATHER,
AND UNEMPLOYED.

300
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,969
         YOUR DAUGHTER
         PASSED AWAY?

301
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,337
NO, MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.

302
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,139
SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

303
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,941
TAKEN VERY, VERY YOUNG.

304
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,376
AND I TRY TO HELP
AS MUCH AS I CAN,

305
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,278
WITH MY PENSION.

306
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,414
OF COURSE, THERE'S APRIL.

307
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,015
APRIL'S THE YOUNGEST,

308
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,884
AND SHE HAD MENINGITIS
AS A BABY.

309
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,152
SHE'LL NEVER WALK.

310
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,121
        WELL, I'M SORRY.
        I HAD NO IDEA.

311
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,590
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU?

312
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,158
IS THIS YOUR WIFE?

313
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,093
                            YES.

314
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,463
SHE'S...BEAUTIFUL.

315
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,633
IS IT TRUE THAT
SHE'S NO LONGER WITH US?

316
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,168
        THAT'S CORRECT.

317
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,371
WELL, I'M A WIDOW, TOO.
27 YEARS. MM.

318
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,939
  AND YOU?

319
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,307
         SEVEN MONTHS.

320
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,642
OH.

321
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,445
THE FIRST YEAR'S
THE MOST PAINFUL,

322
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,613
BUT YOU'LL GET OVER IT.

323
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,448
      I'M ALREADY OVER IT.

324
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,350
      WE HATED EACH OTHER.

325
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,556
    WELL...

326
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,260
NOW, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

327
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,328
YOU CALL ME
AND I'M RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

328
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,999
    YES, I ALREADY PAY A LADY
    TO ASK ME IF I NEED ANYTHING

329
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:06,137
              AND TO HEAR ME SAY
              THAT I DON'T.

330
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,573
I DON'T THINK
YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

331
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,376
EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMETHING.

332
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,113
OKAY.

333
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,550
WELL, I PROMISED TO TAKE
APRIL TO THE PEDIATRICIAN.

334
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,956
            WELL...

335
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,126
      THAT IS A CALLOUSED,
      MEAN, OLD MAN.

336
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,460
                  WHEW!

337
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,096
MA'AM, UH...

338
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,465
HE SAID TO GIVE THIS
BACK TO YOU.

339
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,267
                       YEAH?
HE SAID YOU CAN PAY HIM
THE MONEY WHEN YOU HAVE IT.

340
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,436
 HE SAID THAT GRANDCHILDREN
 ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN A CAR.

341
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,305
WELL--

342
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,074
    THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF HIM,
    BUT I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

343
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,076
MA'AM, IF I WAS YOU,
I'D TAKE IT BEFORE
HE CHANGES HIS MIND.

344
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,544
                       YEAH.

345
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,313
        A BEAR WITH ANGEL WINGS.

346
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,415
                           WHOA!

347
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,718
        ARTICHOKE WITH
        A TENDER HEART.

348
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,621
             WHOA.

349
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,423
         A PORCUPINE...

350
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:02,126
 WITH THE SWEETNESS OF A PANDA.

351
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,177
I'M GOING TO THE STORE.

352
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,646
             ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
             IN PARTICULAR?

353
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,147
YEAH, TO BE 30 YEARS YOUNGER

354
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,216
AND HAVE A PROSTATE
THE SIZE OF A PEANUT.

355
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,551
THANK YOU, LAVERNE.

356
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,152
        OKAY, I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

357
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,721
           SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO.

358
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,122
HMM.

359
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,158
POOR MAN, HMM?
HE'S SICK.

360
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,227
              NO, HE AIN'T SICK.

361
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,029
THEN WHY IS HE IN BED
ALL DAY?

362
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,397
                  I DON'T KNOW.

363
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,532
                UM, HE'S TIRED.

364
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,468
    NO, NO.
    SOMETHING MUST BE DONE,

365
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,404
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST
LET A MAN JUST--

366
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,107
HIM-- CAST HIMSELF OUT
LIKE THAT.

367
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,477
    WELL, I TRIED, BUT YOU KNOW,
    HE'S KIND OF STUBBORN.

368
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,147
      STUBBORN?

369
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,083
OH. THAT'S A CHALLENGE.

370
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,786
SO, DID THAT OLD LADY
ACROSS THE HALL
EVER GIVE YOU THE CHECK?

371
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,287
             NOPE.

372
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,822
REALLY? BECAUSE I SPOKE
TO HER SON ABOUT IT.

373
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,425
       SHE GAVE ME CASH.

374
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,396
 THAT IS STRANGE.

375
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,664
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO BE

376
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,800
REALLY HARD TO GET
MONEY OUT OF THAT OLD BAG.

377
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,134
      AND YOU WERE WRONG.

378
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,338
COUNT IT.

379
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,075
      SO, TO WHAT DO I OWE
      THIS VISIT?

380
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,777
     EVERYONE ALL DOLLED UP
     TO THE NINES.

381
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,147
WELL, WE JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING,

382
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,649
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE
GETTING ALONG WITH LAVERNE.

383
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,385
  WELL, WAS AN ENTIRE
  CONVENTION REALLY NECESSARY

384
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,153
    TO FIND OUT HOW THINGS
    WERE GOING WITH LAVERNE?

385
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,488
     I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE
     CALLED ME AND SAID,

386
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,789
        "HOW ARE THINGS
        WITH LAVERNE?"

387
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,424
 AND I WOULD HAVE SAID, "FINE."

388
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,093
COME ON, DAD.

389
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,594
JACK...

390
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,796
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN CALL ME "DAD"?

391
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,466
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN
IN THE FAMILY FOR 15 YEARS.

392
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,368
EVEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
UNDERSTOOD BY NOW

393
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,636
THAT I'M NOT YOUR FATHER.

394
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,441
   OKAY, DAD.

395
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,777
THERE IS...A BUSINESS

396
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,846
THAT WE'D LIKE GET INTO.

397
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,114
I'LL EXPLAIN.

398
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:42,286
  FRED, I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE
  A BIG WAREHOUSE

399
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,821
    AND THE RIGHTS TO LAUNCH

400
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,257
       AN AWESOME PRODUCT
       INTO THE MARKET.

401
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,861
    LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

402
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:54,866
   "NEVER EVER LOSE" GLASSES.

403
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,635
     FOR THE ABSENT-MINDED.

404
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,737
            ALSO...

405
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,341
    THEY'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE.

406
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,643
        BUT WITH THIS...

407
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,246
...FOUND THEM.

408
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,883
     AND JUST TILL YOU LOSE
     THE REMOTE CONTROL.

409
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:14,585
  IS THERE A REMOTE CONTROL
  TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL?

410
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,786
         GOOD QUESTION.

411
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,890
        AND, A HANDY,
        CONVENIENT CHAIN

412
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,360
    TO WEAR AROUND YOUR NECK
    SO IT STAYS WITH YOU ALWAYS.

413
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,196
  WELL, WHY CAN'T WE WEAR
  OUR GLASSES AROUND OUR NECK

414
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,899
         AND CUT OUT
         THE MIDDLEMAN?

415
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,501
WELL, DAD, WE WANTED
TO KNOW IF YOU MIGHT

416
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,203
WANT TO INVEST SOME MONEY
IN THE IDEA.

417
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,538
                   AND WE'LL DO
                   ALL THE WORK.

418
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,339
       YOU JUST HAVE TO SIT BACK
       AND COLLECT

419
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,508
         YOUR FAT DIVIDEND
         AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

420
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,711
   HOW MUCH WILL IT COST ME?

421
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:44,315
                UH, $60,000.

422
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,193
TALK TO HIM. TALK TO HIM.

423
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,729
HEY, DAD. YOUR HAND HURT?

424
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,265
         NO, NO.
         NO, NO.

425
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,769
       YOU KNOW, DAD, I'VE NEVER
       ASKED YOU FOR ANY HELP.

426
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,504
I KNOW THAT.

427
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,272
YOU'RE ASKING HELP
FOR YOUR HUSBAND,

428
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,709
WHOM YOU KNOW I LOVE AS MUCH
AS SCIATIC NERVE PAIN.

429
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,744
              YEAH, WELL,
              I REALLY LOVE HIM.

430
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,280
WELL, THAT IS
A COMPLETE MYSTERY TO ME.

431
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,449
       WELL, I KNOW IT MIGHT
       SEEM STRANGE TO YOU, DAD,

432
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,485
          BUT WHEN I'M WITH HIM,
          I JUST FEEL LIKE...

433
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,954
     I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING.

434
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,990
BUT YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID
OF EXACTLY THAT,

435
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,725
BEING WITH HIM.

436
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,294
HE'S SO SLEAZY.

437
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:35,533
          WELL, IT'S NOT JUST US
          THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR.

438
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,702
               THERE IS MICHAEL,
               HIS FUTURE.

439
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,437
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT ALREADY.

440
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,540
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

441
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,476
                    THANKS, DAD.

442
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,846
             OH, AND BY THE WAY,
             IT'S NOT $60,000.

443
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,249
                   IT'S $90,000.

444
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,894
               ¶¶

445
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,601
               WHAT DO YOU WANT?
               WHO LET YOU IN?

446
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,503
     MOM GAVE ME THE KEYS.

447
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,506
  NO, OF COURSE. ANYONE CAN COME
  INTO MY HOUSE AS THEY PLEASE.

448
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,041
                 IT'S A SEAPORT.

449
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,542
             SORRY.

450
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,745
               NO, NO, NO, NO.
               YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

451
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:21,946
              YOU CAN STAY.

452
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,753
          OH, BOY, DO YOU STINK.
          WHOA. GOD.

453
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,955
SMELL THAT?

454
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,556
I'M BECOMING A MAN.

455
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,459
LISTEN, GRANDPA,
MOM SENT ME--

456
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,661
            UH-OH, DON'T TELL ME

457
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:37,895
                YOU'VE COME HERE
                TO TAKE ME OUT.

458
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,397
  THERE'S A NICE PARK NEARBY.

459
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,532
          "THERE'S A NICE PARK."

460
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,302
    WHY'S EVERYBODY KEEP TALKING
    ABOUT THIS PARK?

461
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,704
         I MEAN, WHAT'S SO GREAT
         ABOUT THIS PARK?

462
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,640
          SITTING ON A BENCH,
          LOOKING LIKE AN IDIOT.

463
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,310
      SWEET, WONDERFUL GRANDSON,

464
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,944
           DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

465
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:57,381
                 GRANDPA DOESN'T
                 WANT TO GO OUT.

466
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,350
              HE'S FINE AT HOME.

467
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,651
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO GO OUT,

468
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,554
SO I CAME WITH A PLAN B.

469
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,028
MOM, IT'S SO HARD
     TO GET TAKEN SERIOUSLY

470
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,596
        AS AN ARTIST...

471
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,798
       WITHOUT A BACKER.

472
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,333
DIDN'T SEBASTIAN SAY

473
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,435
            YOU COULD DO A SHOW
            WHENEVER YOU WANTED?

474
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,003
     YEAH, AND SOON AS
     I SHOW UP TO ASK HIM,

475
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,738
        HE SAYS TO ME,
        "YOU'RE WELCOME,

476
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,939
      AS LONG AS YOU
      COUGH UP THE CASH."

477
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,607
                  WELL, HOW MUCH
                  DOES HE WANT?

478
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,110
A LOT, AND THEY ONLY DO
EXHIBITIONS WITH OTHER ARTISTS.

479
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,511
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

480
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,647
            MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.

481
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,084
  OR-- WELL, WHAT ARE WE TALKING
  ABOUT HERE, DEAR? HOW MUCH?

482
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,052
$1,500 UP FRONT.

483
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,724
WHO'S THAT?
            F.B.I.

484
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,792
   RAYMOND, WHAT A SURPRISE.

485
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,527
  <i> DID YOU GIVE HIM THE CHECK?</i>

486
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,696
      WELL, I WENT OVER,
      BUT HE WASN'T THERE,

487
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,532
      <i> MOM, WHERE ARE YOU?</i>

488
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,000
                I'M IN A MUSEUM,

489
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,769
                AND I CAN'T TALK
                RIGHT NOW, DEAR,

490
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,003
         BECAUSE I HAVE A MAN
         GLARING AT ME.

491
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,039
             <i> MOM?</i>
              BYE.

492
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,043
     PRETTY SOON HE'LL PUT
     A PRIVATE EYE ON ME.

493
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,113
OKAY, I'LL ASK
FOR THE CHECK.

494
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,782
YOU'RE PAYING, RIGHT?
I DON'T HAVE A DIME.

495
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,755
OW! OWIE!

496
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,958
<i> MRS. HAYES! PLEASE, PLEASE.</i>

497
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,460
I NEED HELP.

498
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,795
JUST A MINUTE.

499
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:18,796
 <i> MRS. HAYES!</i>

500
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,932
MRS. HAYES!
             YES, YES.

501
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,968
<i> I WOULDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU</i>
<i> BUT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.</i>

502
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,404
<i> I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.</i>
                YES, I'M COMING.

503
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,806
PLEASE, EVERYTHING IS DESTROYED.
IT'S A COMPLETE CATASTROPHE.

504
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,108
                  HOUSE ON FIRE?
NO, IT'S THE PIPE.

505
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,711
I DON'T KNOW. MRS. HAYES--
                           ELSA.

506
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,646
PLEASE HELP ME,
I BEG YOU.

507
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,815
        EVERYONE'S GONE.
        THE SUPER'S OUT.

508
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,050
       LAVERNE IS IN PITTSBURGH.

509
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,952
              NOW, I DON'T KNOW
              HOW THIS HAPPENED,

510
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,487
 BUT I WAS TURNING ON THE FAUCET

511
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,922
        TO GET A GLASS OF WATER,
        AND LOOK!

512
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,624
THIS WOULDN'T STOP!

513
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,029
              TURN OFF THE WATER
              AT THE MAIN PIPE.

514
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,798
             WHERE'S THE FAUCET?

515
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,433
                   I DON'T KNOW.

516
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,801
     YOU DON'T KNOW
     WHERE YOUR FAUCET IS?

517
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,604
    OKAY, I'M GOING TO FIND
    THE FAUCET.

518
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,673
             OKAY.

519
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,509
         WAIT A MINUTE.

520
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,012
           WE GOT IT.

521
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,013
OH.

522
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,183
                 WELL, THANK GOD
                 THAT'S OVER.

523
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,785
      YOU DON'T THANK GOD.
      YOU THANK ME.

524
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,857
     I'M BOUND TO GET PNEUMONIA.

525
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,893
    NO, YOU WON'T.

526
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,495
   FRED, HELP ME.
                        NO.

527
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,696
  PLEASE, HELP ME.
                        I CAN'T.

528
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,798
            MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
            NOT TO EXERT MYSELF.

529
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,200
NO, JUST HELP ME UP, DEAR.

530
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:30,601
              OH, ALL RIGHT.

531
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,102
    OKAY, ONE SECOND.
    LET ME JUST WALK.

532
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:35,239
     I CAN-- I--

533
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,609
OKAY.

534
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,744
HERE WE GO.

535
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,180
"HELP."

536
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,216
                 WHAT?

537
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,218
              I'M CERTAIN
              YOU GOT PNEUMONIA.

538
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,240
FRED?

539
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:10,908
                       HERE.

540
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,014
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
LYING IN BED LIKE THAT?

541
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,749
              WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
              ON YOUR FEET?

542
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,217
                WHERE DO YOU GO?

543
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,553
       WHY BOTHER RUNNING AROUND
       IN CIRCLES LIKE THAT?

544
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,121
                 IT'S POINTLESS.

545
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,223
       I'M TIRED, SO I'M IN BED.

546
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,760
OKAY.

547
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,028
                           GOOD.

548
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,030
YES. I USED TO HAVE
A RESTAURANT, YEARS AGO.

549
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,299
                      ALL RIGHT.

550
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,536
         IS THIS CREAM DRESSING?

551
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,604
NO, IT'S VERY, VERY, HEALTHY

552
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,139
AND NUTRITIOUS
AND WELL-BALANCED.

553
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,707
I USED TO BE A DIETICIAN.

554
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,545
         HOW MANY THINGS
         HAVE YOU BEEN, EXACTLY?

555
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,748
OH, FRED, YOU KNOW,

556
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,283
LIFE IS LONG,

557
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:55,286
AND WHEN YOU'VE LIVED
SO MANY YEARS,

558
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,655
AND YOU DO THINGS,
AND YOU DON'T THINK
WHEN YOU'RE DOING THEM,

559
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:58,989
THEY MATTER ALL THAT MUCH,

560
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,592
AND THEN, ONE DAY
YOU WAKE UP AND YOU REALIZE

561
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:04,628
YOU MANAGED QUITE A BIT,

562
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,764
AND SO MUCH SO YOU CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER IT ALL.

563
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:07,765
          OH, I REMEMBER IT ALL.

564
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,667
         HOME, WORK. WORK, HOME.

565
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,336
HM. WHAT'S THAT?

566
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:15,239
         THAT WAS MY FIRST LIFE.

567
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,641
             OVER.

568
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,876
               I USED TO PLAY
               CLASSICAL GUITAR.

569
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,611
     I HAD A CAREER AHEAD OF ME.

570
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:24,048
  I WAS FIXING UP MY FIRST HOME.
  I HAD AN ELECTRIC SAW.

571
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,849
        YOU KNOW,
        THE DO-IT-YOURSELF KIND.

572
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:30,321
              I SLIPPED AND, UM,
              SEVERED MY TENDON.

573
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,058
OH. OH, FRED.

574
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,693
  I'M SO SORRY.

575
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,331
   THE ONLY THING
   THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

576
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,866
OH, THAT'S
A WONDERFUL ARPEGGIO.

577
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,269
OH, COME ON.
NOW, PLAY SOMETHING FOR ME.

578
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,770
     YOU KNOW,
     I USED TO TEACH MUSIC,

579
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,974
          SO, I KNOW A GOOD HAND
          WHEN I SEE ONE.

580
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:53,177
UH, LEAVE IT. LEAVE IT.
THAT'S ONLY DECORATION.

581
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,112
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO THROW THINGS AWAY.

582
00:26:55,114 --> 00:27:00,351
BESIDES, I TOLD YOU,
MY TECHNIQUE IS IMPERFECT.

583
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,152
             JUST WANTED TO HAVE
             A LITTLE FUN.

584
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,254
                MAKE SOME MUSIC.
                A SONG.

585
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,190
                I DON'T CARE
                ABOUT TECHNIQUE.

586
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,125
     I MEAN, SO-SO WILL DO.

587
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,663
      EXCUSE ME.
      I DON'T DO ANYTHING SO-SO.

588
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,298
        I NEVER HAVE, UNTIL NOW.

589
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,034
            NOW I'M OLD,
            EVERYTHING IS SO-SO.

590
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:20,371
      I MUCH PREFER LYING IN BED
      THAN TO WASTE ENERGY

591
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:24,208
 OBTAINING RESULTS THAT
 I KNOW WILL ALWAYS BE MEDIOCRE,

592
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,678
      AND THAT GOES FOR WALKING,
      TALKING, THINKING.

593
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,414
       EVERY DAY, WORSE.
       NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

594
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,349
           THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

595
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,818
        THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

596
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,223
              JUST GOING TO NEED
              A LITTLE REST NOW.

597
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,058
                       IN PEACE.

598
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,665
ONLY THE DEAD
REST IN PEACE.

599
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,667
           ARE YOU FAMILIAR
           WITH THE LIVING DEAD?

600
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,001
                           GOOD.

601
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,338
             I AM THAT RARE CASE
             OF THE DEAD LIVING.

602
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,975
           I SEEM ALIVE,
           BUT I'M ALREADY DEAD.

603
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,096
            THEY INSTALLED IT
            WITHOUT A WASHER.

604
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,130
        THAT'S WHY IT EXPLODED.

605
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,432
          OH!

606
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,267
GOOD JOB, ARMANDE.

607
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,270
 YOU KNOW,
 WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT YOU?

608
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,772
UH, I'LL LEAVE IT OPEN,
MR. BARCROFT.

609
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,974
YOU WON'T HAVE TO GET UP
TO LET ME IN.

610
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,115
    FRED.

611
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,919
             FRED.

612
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,288
             FRED.

613
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,495
     OH.
     I FOUND THE DOOR OPEN.

614
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,297
        HM.

615
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,833
               I CAME FOR YOUR
               MEMORIAL SERVICE,

616
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,434
            BUT I SEE
            YOU'RE QUITE ACTIVE.

617
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,769
OH, YEAH.

618
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:00,504
PEAK ACTIVITY TIME
AROUND HERE.

619
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,741
                WELL, THANK YOU.

620
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:04,942
     FOR WHAT?

621
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,343
                 FOR INVITING ME
                 TO SIT DOWN.

622
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,045
           I CAN READ YOUR MIND.

623
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,513
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

624
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,992
             SO, WHAT'S GOING ON
             IN THE WORLD?

625
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,994
WELL, NOTHING.
IT'S ALL NONSENSE.

626
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,462
        THEN WHY ARE YOU READING
        THE NEWSPAPER?

627
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,065
I READ THE OBITUARIES.

628
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:30,434
   I LIKE TO CATCH UP
   ON MY FRIENDS.

629
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,102
                     OH, FRED...

630
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,271
       WHY DO YOU PRETEND
       TO BE SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT?

631
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,510
LOOK, THIS IS WHO I AM.

632
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,912
IT'S YOU THAT SEES SOMETHING
IN ME, THAT ISN'T THERE.

633
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,347
                BUT IT IS THERE.

634
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:47,251
      YOU GAVE ME THE MOST
      WONDERFUL GIFT LAST NIGHT.

635
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:50,320
EVEN A STONE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO RESIST THOSE STORIES

636
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,523
ABOUT HUNGRY GRANDCHILDREN
AND SICK BABIES.

637
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,358
             NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
             I'M TALKING ABOUT,

638
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,127
             ALTHOUGH, THAT WAS
             AN INCREDIBLE GIFT.

639
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,096
      THANK YOU.
                     NO, I MEAN,

640
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,932
              THAT YOU ASKED
              FOR MY HELP, FRED.

641
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,467
            AND ASKING FOR HELP,

642
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:07,471
    IT'S SHOWING YOUR WEAKNESSES
    AND YOUR HELPLESSNESS

643
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:11,041
             AND STANDING NAKED
             IN FRONT OF OTHERS.

644
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:14,812
           YOU WERE NAKED
           IN FRONT OF ME, FRED.

645
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,249
                 IT'S A SPECIAL,
                 PRECIOUS THING,

646
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,385
       LETTING SOMEONE HELP YOU.

647
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,887
               AND YOU ASKED ME.

648
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,090
       FRED,
       THE PATH TO LIFE IS LONG.

649
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,992
WHO SAID THAT, GANDHI?

650
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,862
MOTHER TERESA OF CALCUTTA?
ROCKY BALBOA?

651
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:33,564
NO, I SAID IT, FRED.

652
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:34,832
I'M BACK.

653
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,568
              I GOT YOU A MELON.

654
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,203
           I WENT TO
           THE PROSTATE COUNTER,

655
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,572
           BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
           NO PEANUT-SIZED ONES.

656
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:42,873
              MORNING, MA'AM.

657
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,245
UH, AHEM,
NOW, LISTEN, UM...

658
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,280
MRS. HAYES--
                           ELSA.

659
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,515
       WHATEVER, ELSA.

660
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,283
I ASKED YOU TO HELP ME

661
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,484
BECAUSE I WAS DROWNING.

662
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,053
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU SEE THAT

663
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,588
AS BEING SO IMPORTANT.

664
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,059
HOWEVER, WHAT DOES STRIKE ME
IS THAT YOU SAY THINGS TO ME

665
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:03,594
THAT NO ONE
HAS EVER SAID BEFORE.

666
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:05,929
   PLEASE,
   WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

667
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:10,601
    I WANT EVERYTHING BETWEEN US
    TO BE THE FIRST TIME.

668
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:14,304
   FRED, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
   TO SHOW YOU THE PATH TO LIFE?

669
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,475
        IF IT MAKES YOU
        FEEL BETTER.

670
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,410
          WELL, IT'S BABY STEPS.

671
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,480
       ONE STEP AFTER THE OTHER.

672
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:28,018
                ONE, TWO, THREE.

673
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,920
                  BABY STEPS.

674
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,191
<i> ¶ SHE WANTS TO RIDE WITH US¶</i>

675
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:35,993
       <i> ¶ UP IN THE CAR ¶</i>

676
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,427
  <i> ¶ SHE KNOWS I'M A RAPPER ¶</i>

677
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,096
   <i> ¶ BUT SHE DON'T KNOW-- ¶</i>

678
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,035
              <i> ¶¶</i>

679
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,539
          EXCUSE ME, COULD I ASK
          FOR SOME INFORMATION

680
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,241
            ABOUT DANCE LESSONS,
            PLEASE?

681
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,676
YES, MA'AM.
               THANK YOU.

682
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,481
FOR YOU?

683
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:00,284
           WELL, IF NOT ME, WHO?

684
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,418
EXCUSE ME JUST ONE MOMENT.

685
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,253
                      THANK YOU.

686
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,426
UM, DO WE HAVE
AN AGE LIMIT?

687
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,662
        NOT OFFICIALLY.

688
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,598
  WE JUST DON'T LIKE 'EM
  CROAKING ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

689
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,334
        TELL HER
        WE'RE FILLED UP.

690
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,469
I'M SORRY, MA'AM,
WE ONLY ACCEPT COUPLES.

691
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,138
                 COUPLES?

692
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,975
             WELL, SHE'S SINGLE.

693
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,443
             AND I'M SINGLE.

694
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,579
UH--
                 NO, NO. THAT'S
                 DISCRIMINATION.

695
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,714
          AND THAT'S NOT OKAY.

696
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:32,049
               WANT TO KNOW WHY?

697
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,017
             WELL, WHEN YOU HAVE

698
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,485
          A LITTLE ROSEBUD MOUTH
          LIKE YOURS,

699
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:38,622
           AND IT STARTS TO TURN
           WRINKLY LIKE THIS,

700
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,358
         AND YOUR LITTLE BOOBS--
         WHICH ARE NOT MUCH
         TO SPEAK OF, ANYWAY--

701
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,728
 WHEN THEY TO START TO FALL LIKE
 FULL, RIPE PLUMS FROM THE TREE,

702
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,264
              WELL, THAT IS WHEN
              YOU UNDERSTAND

703
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:50,200
               YOU'RE INTERESTED
               IN DANCE LESSONS.

704
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,002
                      HM.

705
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,111
HELLO.

706
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,013
         IS FRED HOME?

707
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:05,349
            MM-HM. HE DON'T EVER
            GO NO PLACE.

708
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,620
             NICE.

709
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,223
                 UH, WHERE?

710
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:16,326
OH, HE'S IN HIS HIDEY-HOLE.

711
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,462
<i> H.T.C. UNVEILED</i>
       <i> THE BUTTERFLY "S"</i>

714
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,202
           WHAT ARE YOU DOING
           IN FRONT OF THE T.V.?

715
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,237
           IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
HEY!

716
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,673
   AND YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
   TO TAKE YOU OUT.

717
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,242
             I'M NOT BEAUTIFUL,
             BUT I MAKE IT WORK.

718
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,544
I'M TOO TIRED.
I'M TOO TIRED.

719
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,613
        FRED, YOU NEED
        TO GET SOME AIR.

720
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,081
       YOU'RE NOT GOING
       TO START WITH THAT

721
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,751

722
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,753
I CHANGED MY ADDRESS,
NOT MY BODY.

723
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,287
 YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR HEAD.

724
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,290
I SMELL HAMBURGER.

725
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,725
                   I DON'T.

726
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,327
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE USED TO IT.

727
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:51,428
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

728
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,197
YOU EVEN LOOK LIKE

729
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,733
          WHAT'S WRONG
          WITH A COLORFUL SHIRT?

730
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,102
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
AT OUR AGE,

731
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,137
THAT JUST DON'T WORK.

732
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,772
      TRUST ME, I'M YOUR DOCTOR.

733
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:04,641
      THE MORE YOU STAY IN BED,
      THE MORE TIRED YOU'LL GET.

734
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,210
      GO TO THE PARK.
      THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL PARK--

735
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,745
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
      --RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

736
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:11,348
JUST MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!
I'M JUST FINE!

737
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,652
LET ME BE TIRED
WHEN I WANT TO BE TIRED.

738
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,121
        PLEASE.

739
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,769
                      LAVERNE...

740
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,175
  I'M GOING OUT.

741
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,690
                  OH, FRED.

742
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,827
              OH, COME IN.
              STEP NUMBER ONE.

743
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,467
               YES, THAT'S ME
               WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

744
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,470
          OH, YES, IF YOU'D
          KNOWN ME 50 YEARS AGO,

745
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:08,138
           YOU WOULD BELIEVE IT.

746
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,639
    WE LOOKED QUITE A BIT ALIKE.

747
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,709
          AND I HAD BLONDE HAIR,
          AND PLATINUM.

748
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,145
             EVERYONE MISTOOK US
             FOR EACH OTHER.

749
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,447
             OF COURSE, IT DROVE
             MY HUSBAND CRAZY.

750
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,716
            SOMETIMES NOW,
            WHEN I NOW TRY
            TO PICTURE HIS FACE,

751
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,785
                  I CAN'T, AND--
                  HAVE A SEAT.

752
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:25,155
                      THANK YOU.
I MEAN, 23 YEARS
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER HIS FACE.

753
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,324
             23? I THOUGHT
             YOU SAID IT WAS 27.

754
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:29,693
     OH, WELL, IF YOU COUNT

755
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,795
     THE FOUR YEARS BEFORE
     WE WERE MARRIED,

756
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,330
         THAT MAKES 27.

757
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:37,234
      SOMETIMES, I SAY 23.
      SOMETIMES, I SAY 27.

758
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,502
SIT DOWN, FRED.
                 THANK YOU.

759
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:42,272
SO, I SEE YOU WERE
GRABBED BY ANITA.

760
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,907
AT THE TREVI FOUNTAIN IN ROME.

761
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,675
              WHO IS THIS ANITA?

762
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,878
   IS SHE A CHARACTER
   IN THE MOVIE, OR THE ACTRESS?

763
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,413
THIS IS ANITA EKBERG,
THE ACTRESS.

764
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,249
<i> LA DOLCE VITA.</i>

765
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,717
    MASTROIANNI,

766
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,619
         FELLINI,
         YOU REMEMBER.

767
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,821
 OH, I'VE HEARD OF IT,
 BUT I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING IT.

768
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:01,158
OH, WELL, IT'S THE GREATEST
FILM OF ALL TIME,

769
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,728
AND I HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF GOING TO THE TREVI FOUNTAIN,

770
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,197
BUT MAX--
HE'D NEVER TAKE ME.

771
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,632
I TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM,

772
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:11,868
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS SO MUCH
MORE WORK GOING ON, AND...

773
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,871
BUT MY DREAM WAS,
I WOULD BE ANITA,

774
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,274
AND HE WOULD BE MARCELLO.

775
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,445
BUT I SUPPOSE IT WAS
NOT MEANT TO HAPPEN.

776
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:26,349
SO, I SUPPOSE YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW PICASSO.

777
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,385
            THE DRESS DESIGNER?

778
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,220
  NO, THE ARTIST.

779
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:32,756
      I KNOW. IT'S JUST
      A FEEBLE ATTEMPT AT HUMOR.

780
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,327
HE PAINTED A WONDERFUL
PORTRAIT OF ME.
                            NO.

781
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,795
YES, HE DID.

782
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,463
I WAS A YOUNG GIRL,

783
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,732
AND HE WAS VERY MATURE,

784
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,902
BUT WE HAD A PLATONIC,

785
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,673
BUT, UM, PASSIONATE LOVE.

786
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:52,509
       WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,
       EXACTLY, IF I MAY ASK?

787
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,411
WELL, IT MEANS THAT

788
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,746
THERE WAS A REALLY CRAZY
ATTRACTION BETWEEN US,

789
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,616
ALTHOUGH WE NEVER
DID ANYTHING.

790
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,384
   NOTHING.

791
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,587
AND ONE DAY,
HE GRABBED THIS PIECE OF PAPER,

792
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,555
AND HE PAINTED MY PORTRAIT,

793
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,691
AND HE SAID--
AH, I REMEMBER IT

794
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,359
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY--
HE SAID,

795
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:13,230
"AH, THIS IS BETTER
THAN INTERCOURSE"

796
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:16,366
AND I SAID,
"PABLO, YES."

797
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,869
                  STILL HAVE IT?

798
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,339
YES, OF COURSE.
I HAVE IT IN THE SAFE.

799
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,841
BUT, UM, I COULDN'T TELL YOU
WHERE THE KEYS ARE NOW.

800
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:27,811
I'LL GET IT.
I'LL GET THEM.

801
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:33,917
    WELL, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE HAD
    AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE.

802
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,585
                      IT'S TRUE.

803
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,887
      A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN CAN HAVE
      EVERYTHING SHE WANTS.

804
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,323
WELL, FRED, LET ME REMIND YOU,
THAT'S NOT ME.

805
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,626
      OH, I KNOW THAT.
      SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU.

806
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,295
WELL, I HAVE PICTURES OF MYSELF,
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

807
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:46,997
                  I BELIEVE YOU.
                  I BELIEVE YOU.

808
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:49,666
          YOU'RE JUST DIFFERENT,
          THAT'S ALL.

809
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,269
SO, FRED, TELL ME, WHAT--

810
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,271
WHAT HAVE YOU GOTTEN
OUT OF LIFE?

811
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,006
              HM?

812
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:58,475
     OH, 40 YEARS
     OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS,

813
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,010
        A BUM MARRIAGE,

814
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,544
   A BALL-BREAKING DAUGHTER,

815
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,946
        WHO I'M FOND OF,
        OCCASIONALLY,

816
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,714
      ONE OR TWO FRIENDS,

817
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,784
    AND THAT'S MY 80 YEARS.

818
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,554
YOU'RE 80? YOU'RE--
YOU'RE OLDER THAN ME.

819
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,290
                    REALLY?

820
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,926
WELL, THAT SENTENCE
DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

821
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,428
      I'M 74.

822
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,397
YOU'RE WITH A YOUNGER WOMAN.

823
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,399
YEAH.

824
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:26,503
SO, TELL ME, WITH ALL YOUR
80 YEARS BEING ON THIS EARTH,

825
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,338
HOW MUCH DID YOU LAUGH?

826
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,677
                 VERY LITTLE.

827
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,916
WELL, STICK WITH ME, FRED,
AND, UM...

828
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,319
HAVE A DRINK
AND TRY THE PASTRIES.

829
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,622
                      UM...

830
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,893
              UM, WHY DON'T YOU
              PLAY ME SOMETHING?

831
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,432
          WELL...

832
00:38:58,537 --> 00:38:59,736
     NO, I ASKED YOU FIRST.

833
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,037
   YOU PLAY SOMETHING FOR ME,

834
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,039
       THEN I'LL PLAY
       SOMETHING FOR YOU.

835
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,843
    YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT
    A LONG TIME.

836
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,945
REMEMBER, BABY STEPS.

837
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:12,716
YOU'RE READY
FOR THE SECOND?

838
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:14,784
OH, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!

839
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:18,521
WELL, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
      OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

840
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,924
          CHILDREN REGURGITATING
          THEIR FOOD.

841
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:23,560
       OLD PEOPLE SITTING AROUND
       ON BENCHES,

842
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:26,529
     WAITING TO POP THEIR CLOGS.

843
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,533
OH, COME ON. TELL ME,
DID YOU AND YOUR WIFE

844
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,768
REALLY HATE EACH OTHER?

845
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,970
     WELL, SHE WAS A GOOD WOMAN.

846
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,605
              WE HAD OUR
              MISUNDERSTANDINGS.

847
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,107
AND THAT'S IT?

848
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,109
               YEAH, SHE WAS
               A GOOD ORGANIZER.

849
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,044
       SHE ORGANIZED EVERYTHING.

850
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,480
WERE YOU HAPPY?

851
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:44,848
               UH, I DON'T KNOW.

852
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,450
           I NEVER ASKED MYSELF.

853
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:49,552
            WELL, YOU KNOW,
            WE WERE JUST NORMAL,

854
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,653
              LIKE OTHER PEOPLE.

855
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,122
     UNHAPPY.

856
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:55,058
    I'M SORRY, DO YOU THINK
    WE COULD CHANGE THE SUBJECT?

857
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,826
               I DON'T LIKE
               TALKING ABOUT IT.

858
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,027
     OKAY.

859
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,929
            IN FACT,
            I'D LIKE TO GO HOME.

860
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,799
OH, RIGHT.
YOU'RE TIRED.

861
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:06,469
         NO, I DON'T LIKE PARKS.

862
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,605
    THEY MAKE ME FEEL
    I'M ALREADY IN THE CEMETERY.

863
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:11,141
        I NEVER TOOK MY DAUGHTER
        WHEN SHE WAS A KID.

864
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:13,943
              I NEVER TOOK A DOG
              WHEN I HAD A DOG.

865
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,945
FINE. WE'LL GO BACK.

866
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,747
COME, COME.

867
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,716
WHY ARE YOU SO GRUMPY?

868
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,462
EXCUSE ME?

869
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:35,131
I NEED SOME FLOWERS HERE.
WILL YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

870
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,634
      SURE. ARE THEY FOR A LADY?

871
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,935
YEAH.
                             OH.

872
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,670
              PERHAPS SHE'D LIKE
              SOME ROSES.

873
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,039
I'VE NO IDEA.

874
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,709
     OH. THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME
     BRINGING HER FLOWERS?

875
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,178
YEAH. UM, THIS...

876
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,879
           OH, THOSE ARE LOVELY.

877
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:10,867
                YEAH, I KNEW
                YOU'D BE PISSED.

878
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,202
    SINCE IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS

879
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:15,939
              AND I HAVEN'T COME
              TO SEE YOU ONCE.

880
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,708
        THE MORE YOU GOT PISSED,
        THE MORE I DIDN'T COME.

881
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,110
        ANYWAY,
        I NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE.

882
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,812
                     ASK AROUND.

883
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,881
                  I DON'T EVEN
                  GO SEE ANYONE.

884
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:27,851
           NOT EVEN LIVE PEOPLE.

885
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,953
                   LISTEN, UM...

886
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:33,223
             I WANTED TO ASK YOU
             SOMETHING.

887
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:36,192
                  WERE WE HAPPY?

888
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,830
                     NO. I KNOW.

889
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,133
       JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

890
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,882
            YOU HAVE GOT A SHOW.

891
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:00,517
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

892
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,785
       DON'T ASK. AND NOT A WORD
       TO YOUR BROTHER.

893
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,292
      OH, NO FLORAL SHIRT TODAY.

894
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,693
                 IT WAS STRIPED.

895
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,695
          YEAH, SAME DIFFERENCE.

896
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,597
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S THE SAME.

897
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,033
AT THIS POINT,
NOTHING MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

898
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,537
I'M RESIGNED TO THE FACT
THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE

899
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,673
A VALUE IN THIS LIFE.

900
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:27,076
IT'S TIME TO WAVE
THE WHITE FLAG, OLD FRIEND.

901
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,178
      YOU KNOW,
      YOU COULD USE A CAREGIVER.

902
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,680
                        LAVERNE.

903
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,148
             SHE HAS VERY LITTLE
             LEFT HERE TO DO.

904
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,884
             AND I FEEL BAD.
             SHE NEEDS THE WORK.

905
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,720
OH, KEEP HER CLOSE, FRED.
YOU'LL NEED HER.

906
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,289
OH, YOU'LL NEED HER.

907
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:43,092
       WHY ARE YOU SO NEGATIVE?
       WHAT'S A MATTER WITH YOU?

908
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,595
I STUPIDLY FELL IN LOVE.

909
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,730
              OH, I AM SO SORRY.
              WHO'S THE WOMAN?

910
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,039
IMPOSSIBLE.

911
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,807
                WELL, OF COURSE
                IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

912
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,275
GIVE ME THAT.

913
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,614
OLD WOMEN ARE OLD,
YOUNG GIRLS ARE YOUNG,

914
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:05,982
AND WE...

915
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:07,984
WE'RE JUST TRASH.

916
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:09,852
          TRASH, YEAH.

917
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,322
JUST LIKE YOUR COFFEE.

918
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,594
FRED, ARE YOU READY
FOR STEP NUMBER THREE?

919
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:18,795
                             OH.
              OH.

920
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,663
       I'M SORRY.
       YOU HAVE COMPANY.

921
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:23,866
    OH, THIS IS MY FRIEND, JOHN.
    ELSA, MY NEIGHBOR.

922
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:26,869
I WAS JUST LEAVING.
          OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

923
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,838
     NO, STEP NUMBER THREE
     CAN WAIT.

924
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,907
JOHN.

925
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,909
      IT'S A REAL PLEASURE
      TO MEET YOU.

926
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:34,777
PLEASURE'S MINE.
             I KNOW.

927
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,647
       HAVE A NICE NIGHT.

928
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,821
YOU OLD DOG!

929
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:48,057
WHAT'S ALL THIS
ABOUT A THIRD STEP, HUH?

930
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,692
               OH, IT'S NOTHING.
               IT'S JUST A GAME.

931
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:51,928
A GAME? HOW CUTE.
WHAT SORT OF GAME?

932
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,697
           WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
           TO TELL, REALLY.

933
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:58,368
ACTUALLY, IT'S A LONG STORY.

934
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,971
     I LENT HER SOME MONEY
     AND SHE WANTED TO THANK ME.

935
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,407
THE FACT THAT EVEN YOU
HAVE A LOVE LIFE,

936
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,376
GIVES ME HOPE
FOR MY FUTURE.

937
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:09,412
                  LOVE LIFE?
                  ARE YOU CRAZY?

938
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,682
          A-AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
          BY "EVEN YOU"?

939
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,217
                WHY CAN'T I HAVE
                A LOVE LIFE?

940
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,719
SEE?
CONGRATULATIONS.

941
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,154
SHE SEEMS
A CONSIDERABLE WOMAN.

942
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,355
             WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
             CONSIDER HER THEN?

943
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,224
                       GO AHEAD.
I MIGHT JUST DO THAT.

944
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,359
      I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT.
      SHE'S A WOMAN WITH ISSUES.

945
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,795
ALL WOMEN HAVE ISSUES.
WHAT KIND OF ISSUES?

946
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,131
       SHE SUPPORTS HER WIDOWED,

947
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,933
             UNEMPLOYED SON
             WITH FIVE CHILDREN,

948
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:33,803
        SHE'S A LITTLE UNHINGED.

949
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:35,405
        BUT GO AHEAD,
        YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF.

950
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,206
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

951
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,876
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS,
IN ALL THESE YEARS.

952
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,750
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU.

953
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:49,786
BLINDLY.

954
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:53,890
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
WHAT IS THIS THIRD STEP?

955
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:55,958
         DO YOU TRUST ME OR NOT?

956
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,931
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A THING.

957
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,433
                I WILL TAKE CARE
                OF EVERYTHING.

958
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:05,468
                 IT'S ALL RIGHT.
                 HELLO!

959
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,370
  SO, I'M NOT SINGLE ANYMORE.

960
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,440
  WE'RE HERE TO TRY OUT FIRST
  A LESSON.

961
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,478
YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS.
            THANK YOU.

962
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,015
NOW, FRED...

963
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:22,051
      SIGN IT?
      ARE YOU COMPLETELY INSANE?

964
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,153
             I'M NOT DOING THAT.
NO, LOOK-- LOOK--

965
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,455
         NO, NO.
         I'M NOT GOING IN THERE.

966
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:26,989
NO, LOOK, FRED.

967
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,058
IT'S WONDERFUL.
GIVE IT A CHANCE.

968
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,060
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT--
 YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND, WOMAN.

969
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,895
FRED, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LEARN THIS DANCE.

970
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,231
THERE'S SO MANY THAT
YOU WOULD ENJOY DOING.

971
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,200
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
THEN WE CAN LEAVE.

972
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:39,035
                 ELSA, GOOD-BYE.

973
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:41,037
    I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
    ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

974
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,487
OH, GOD.

975
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,758
WHY ARE OLD PEOPLE
ALWAYS SO PISSED OFF?

976
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,226
               I DON'T KNOW.
               WHO'S PISSED OFF?

977
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:04,861
OTHER THAN YOU?

978
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:07,130
I'M NOT.

979
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:08,431
           NO. YEAH,
           I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

980
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,800
I'M PISSED OFF.

981
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,268
AND THEN
THERE'S MOM AND DAD, TOO.

982
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,803
    AND WHY ARE THEY PISSED OFF?

983
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,438
WELL, DAD, BECAUSE
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY

984
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,106
FOR THE REMOTE-CONTROLLED
GLASSES STORE.

985
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,975
                        AND MOM?
WELL, MOM...

986
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:21,344
MOM IS PISSED OFF
AT EVERYTHING.

987
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,079
SHE YELLS ALL THE TIME.

988
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,181
SOMETIMES,
I WANT TO STRANGLE HER.

989
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,849
                  YEAH, WELL,
                  YOU CAN'T NOW.

990
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,885
             YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT
             TO GET YOUR REVENGE

991
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,887
                 WHEN SHE'S OLD.

992
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:33,422
     SHE'S DOING THAT TO ME NOW.

993
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,091
WHY DOES SHE WANT REVENGE?

994
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,493
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
            IF I WAS A GOOD DAD.

995
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,462
            I DON'T THINK I WAS.

996
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,863
WELL, YOU'RE
A GOOD GRANDPA THOUGH.

997
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,443
                      ARMANDE...

998
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:55,845
                  WHAT HAVE YOU
                  GONE AND DONE?

999
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:58,581
      I FELL OFF A LADDER.

1000
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,184
ARMANDE! WHAT THE HELL?

1001
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:03,019
     I KNOW. IT'S, LIKE,
     TWO MONTHS LIKE THIS.

1002
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:05,421
   WHO'S GOING TO HELP ME?
   I'VE GOT TO FIND SOMEBODY.

1003
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,390
OH, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

1004
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:10,193
UM...

1005
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,429
              YOU LOOKING AT ME?
YEAH.

1006
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,531
      WHAT'S LYDIA GOING TO SAY?

1007
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,534
DO WE CARE?

1008
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,451
NOW, YOU GO ON, DEAR.

1009
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,286
                    NO, MOTHER--
NO, I'LL CATCH A CAB.

1010
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:40,556
IT'S FINE.

1011
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:45,461
EXCUSE ME.
HI, ELSA.

1012
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:48,898
        THANK YOU, WILL.

1013
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,505
ARE WE DOING
OUR HOMEWORK, ELSA?

1014
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:57,573
                         MM-HMM.

1015
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,275
HMM.
             DOING OUR HOMEWORK.

1016
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,544
 HMM.
            BUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT,

1017
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,313
                I FORGOT TO TAKE
                MY GREEN PILL.

1018
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,082
AND WHY IS THAT?

1019
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:09,318
                I WAS BUSY DOING
                OTHER THINGS.

1020
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,954
        IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING,
        BUT I THINK...

1021
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,522
    WELL, MAYBE IT'S FRIENDSHIP.

1022
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:14,590
YOU THINK?

1023
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,158
      BUT I NEVER DID UNDERSTAND

1024
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,062
            WHEN FRIENDSHIP ENDS
            AND LOVE BEGINS.

1025
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:25,601
             BUT, IN MY OPINION,
             IF IT'S LOVE...

1026
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,905
          IT'S SO MUCH SO SWIFT!

1027
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:32,208
      AND THEN YOU TELL YOURSELF
      IT'S FRIENDSHIP.

1028
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,443
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

1029
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,280
         OH, WELL,
         YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
         TO SCREW IT UP.

1030
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:40,249
         YOU KNOW,
         I, ON THE OTHER HAND...

1031
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,319
YOU'RE NOT THAT SICK, ELSA.

1032
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:45,321
        OH, NO, DON'T LIE TO ME,
        DOCTOR.

1033
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:48,557
         I SAW THE TEST RESULTS.

1034
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,628
          I COULD HARDLY MAKE IT
          OVER HERE, BY MYSELF.

1035
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,696
                             MM.

1036
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,535
              <i> ¶¶</i>

1037
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:39,342
          MARCELLO...
          MARCELLO...

1038
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,413
     <i> MARCELLO, COME HERE.</i>

1039
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,567
I'M SORRY.

1040
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,402
I'M SORRY.
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

1041
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:10,006
   I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN YOU
   TO THAT DANCE SCHOOL.

1042
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:13,509
           I JUST DIDN'T RESPECT
           YOUR PACE.

1043
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,611
                          BUT...

1044
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,713
          TO SHOW YOU I'M SORRY,
          I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU

1045
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:20,049
        TO THE FINEST RESTAURANT
        IN TOWN.

1046
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,284
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF ACCEPTING.

1047
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:25,654
           OH, YOU'RE STILL MAD.
           ALL RIGHT.

1048
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:29,191
       THEN, LET ME SEE,
       I'LL SAY I'M SORRY AGAIN,

1049
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,060
       AND WE'LL TURN BACK TIME,

1050
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:34,130
           AND-AND WE'LL GO BACK
           TO STEP TWO.

1051
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:36,265
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO TEACH ME HOW TO WALK.

1052
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,200
YOU MADE ME LOOK RIDICULOUS
AT THAT PLACE

1053
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,269
IN FRONT OF ALL
THOSE MAD CRETINS.

1054
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,505
        FRED, YOU LEFT ME THERE.

1055
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:44,407
      YOU LEFT ME STANDING THERE
      LIKE A FOOL.

1056
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,509
         YOU REALLY OFFENDED ME.

1057
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,177
OH, YOU'RE ANGRY
AND OFFENDED?

1058
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:50,212
   I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU
   DO SOMETHING NEW.

1059
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,747
THANK YOU FOR HELPING
THE POOR IMBECILE.

1060
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:53,315
      NO, YOU ASKED ME FOR HELP.

1061
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:56,519
I WOULD HAVE ASKED ANYONE
WITH A PAIR OF HANDS

1062
00:50:56,521 --> 00:51:00,823
TO COME AND TURN OFF A TAP,
WHICH SOME MORON HAD HIDDEN

1063
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,825
IN THE MOST OBSCURE PLACE
POSSIBLE!

1064
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:06,629
ANYBODY? ANYONE?

1065
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:09,165
FRED, I...

1066
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:11,467
I CARED ABOUT YOU
FROM THE FIRST MINUTE.

1067
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:16,072
AND I AM REALLY SORRY
THAT YOU DON'T SEE THAT.

1068
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,640
ELSA?

1069
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,575
ELSA?

1070
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,811
      DON'T LET'S FIGHT ANYMORE.

1071
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:27,216
         IT'S ALL I'VE EVER DONE
         MY WHOLE LIFE.

1072
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:30,786
       I'M SORRY.
       I'M JUST A CRAZY OLD MAN.

1073
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:34,090
I GUESS WE'RE JUST
TWO OLD FOOLS.

1074
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,292
         YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

1075
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,800
YOU GO GET DRESSED NOW

1076
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,836
AND I'LL FORGET THIS
EVER HAPPENED.

1077
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,177
HOW DID YOU
PUT UP WITH HIM?

1078
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:59,115
HE'S A VERY DIFFICULT MAN.

1079
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:00,716
YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM
WITH A...

1080
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,757
ELSA?

1081
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:12,728
WHAT ARE WE?
ME AND YOU?

1082
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,830
EVER SINCE I MET YOU...

1083
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,133
MY LIFE IS DIFFERENT.

1084
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,201
IT'S-IT'S...STRANGE.

1085
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,370
              IS IT GOOD STRANGE
              OR BAD STRANGE?

1086
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:22,571
STRANGE.

1087
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:28,744
              FRED, I DON'T WANT
              TO GET HURT.

1088
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:32,381
           AND I'VE TOLD YOU
           HOW I CARE ABOUT YOU.

1089
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,650
         I'M JUST WONDERING
         IF IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

1090
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,887
                I HAVE SUCH
                STRONG FEELINGS.

1091
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,889
YOU SOUND LIKE A TEENAGER.

1092
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:41,524
I AM A TEENAGER.

1093
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:44,827
YES, YOU ARE.
A GIRL IN THE BODY OF A WOMAN.

1094
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,729
                           YEAH.
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

1095
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,865
                             AW.

1096
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,600
           SO IT'S GOOD STRANGE.

1097
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:52,701
OH, YES.

1098
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:58,507
            DO YOU THINK WE HAVE
            A FUTURE TOGETHER?

1099
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,512
               ARE YOU BLUSHING?

1100
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,415
     I LOVE THIS 80-YEAR-OLD MAN
     SITTING ACROSS FROM ME,

1101
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:09,618
                       BLUSHING.

1102
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:13,889
          HOW COULD I NOT
          FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU?

1103
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,427
                      THANK YOU.

1104
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,396
  WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE?
  CAPPUCCINO, PERHAPS?

1105
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:21,697
     NO. JUST THE CHECK, PLEASE.

1106
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,965
          RIGHT AWAY.

1107
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:26,435
UM...

1108
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,604
                     WHAT IS IT?

1109
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,873
MY GLYCEMIA.

1110
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,242
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE REALLY SICK?

1111
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,945
           PUT YOUR FINGER IN IT
           AND ENJOY IT.

1112
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:37,513
               DO YOU KNOW WHAT
               PABLO SAID TO ME?

1113
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,682
PABLO WHO?
              PICASSO, YOU KNOW.

1114
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:42,618
    HE SAID, "WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
    IS MOCK DEATH,

1115
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,720
     AND THEN,
     SHE WILL BE AFRAID OF YOU."

1116
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:48,991
    YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF DEATH.
    FRED, YOU'RE AFRAID OF LIFE.

1117
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,293
                         FINGER.

1118
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:54,997
                            MMM!

1119
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,299
                  NUM, NUM, NUM!
MMM.

1120
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,401
     WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

1121
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,570
WELL, TO LIFE.

1122
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,773
                  TO LIFE, FRED.

1123
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:08,577
MY GOD.
THEY'RE ROBBING US BLIND.

1124
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,346
            LET ME SEE IT, FRED.

1125
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,848
        I INVITED YOU TO DINNER,
        SO DON'T YOU WORRY.

1126
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,485
ENOUGH MONEY?
       THEY'RE ROBBING US BLIND.

1127
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,821
              FRED, THIS IS WHAT
              WE'RE GOING TO DO.

1128
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:20,623
          ON THE COUNT OF THREE,

1129
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,591
       WE'RE GOING TO GET UP
       AND WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE.

1130
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,393
ARE YOU MAD?
                 NO, NOT AT ALL.

1131
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:25,928
  BECAUSE THEY WILL NEVER NOTICE

1132
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,264
             TWO INNOCUOUS
             OLD PEOPLE LIKE US.

1133
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:29,565
                   READY? ONE...

1134
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,766
                          TWO...
ELSA!

1135
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,434
                          THREE!

1136
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,386
HAVE YOU SEEN THE OLD COUPLE
THAT WERE SITTING AT TABLE FIVE?

1137
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:51,620
YES, THEY JUST LEFT.

1138
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,389
                     THEY JUST--

1139
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:55,524
                     OH, MY GOD.

1140
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,793
- COME ON, FRED!
-      GET IN HERE!

1141
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,595
THIS IS INSANE.
      I'M NOT DOING THIS.

1142
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:01,830
WE ARE NOT PAYING $400
     FOR A DINNER, FRED.

1143
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,699
- NOW, GET IN THE CAR.
-       HEY!

1144
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:05,567
- GET IN NOW!
-      ELSA, THIS IS     NOT GOOD FOR MY HEALTH.

1145
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:06,969
HEY!

1146
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,510
    ARE WE BEING FOLLOWED, FRED?

1147
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,712
I DON'T KNOW.

1148
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:18,480
             EVERYTHING IS FINE.
             DON'T WORRY.

1149
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,849
          DID YOU REALLY THINK
          WE'D END UP IN PRISON?

1150
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:25,988
IT STALLED.
  THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES.
  WHAT'S A MATTER NOW?

1151
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,357
OKAY.

1152
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,496
                 THEY MISSED US.

1153
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,498
OH, YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR MIND, WOMAN.

1154
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,467
FIRST STEP, SECOND STEP,
SIX STEPS.

1155
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:40,069
I DO ALL I CAN
TO KEEP UP WITH YOU,

1156
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:41,870
AND YOU'RE TOTALLY
OFF YOUR ROCKER!

1157
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,573
             OH, FRED, COME ON.
             EVERYTHING IS FINE.

1158
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,942
YEAH, BUT WHY
DIDN'T YOU JUST PAY?

1159
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:49,445
            BECAUSE IT WAS
            A BEAUTIFUL EVENING.

1160
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:50,913
               IT WAS PRICELESS,

1161
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,515
AND WHEN SOMETHING IS PRICELESS,
WHAT IS THERE TO PAY?

1162
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,485
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

1163
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:58,087
                           WHAT?
OH, NO.

1164
00:55:58,089 --> 00:55:59,955
ELSA, I CAN'T BREATHE.

1165
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,024
MY LEFT--
MY LEFT ARM HURTS.

1166
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,826
          FRED, COME ON, PLEASE.
GET ME TO A HOSPITAL.

1167
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:05,728
               YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
NO, GET ME TO A HOSPITAL!

1168
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,096
PLEASE!
         PLEASE LET'S NOT FIGHT.

1169
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:08,497
I KNOW I'M GOING
TO HAVE A STROKE.

1170
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,466
I JUST KNOW IT.
            OH, OF COURSE. OKAY.

1171
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,435
I'M GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE
DROOLING IN A WHEELCHAIR.

1172
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:14,536
OH, GOD.

1173
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:22,444
   I'VE REVIEWED ALL YOUR TESTS.
   EVERYTHING LOOKS NORMAL.

1174
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,546
              MM-HMM.
              TELL ME DID YOU...

1175
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,914
                HAVE ANYTHING
                TO DRINK TONIGHT

1176
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,716
          OR EAT ANY RICH FOODS?

1177
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,785
            EXPERIENCE
            ANY STRONG EMOTIONS?

1178
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:31,687
ALL OF THE ABOVE,
AND UNDER TWO HOURS.

1179
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,422
OH.

1180
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:36,592
    WELL, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
    SOMETHING TO HELP YOU RELAX.

1181
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,694
                GO HOME AND GO
                STRAIGHT TO BED.

1182
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:45,734
HE WILL.
IF THIS LADY WILL LET ME.

1183
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,603
         MA'AM, YOUR HUSBAND'S
         JUST A LITTLE STRESSED.

1184
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:48,804
               HE NEEDS TO REST.

1185
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:51,106
MY HUSBAND?
OH, YES. HE IS, UH...

1186
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:54,676
WE'VE-- MARRIAGE IS SUCH
A LONG THING.

1187
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:58,747
HE IS SO BORING
THAT I HAVE TO SHAKE HIM UP

1188
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,949
EVERY--

1189
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,454
    THE WIVES--
    OH, THEY'RE INSUFFERABLE
    FROM THE START!

1190
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:06,789
       HERE YOU GO.
       PILLS. THANK YOU.

1191
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,996
  HOW ADORABLE.
  EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

1192
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:15,531
    THEY STILL WANT TO FIGHT
    AND MAKE UP.

1193
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,084
             WELL, THIS IS WHERE
             I FOUND YOU,

1194
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,086
          AND THIS IS WHERE I...

1195
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:39,688
              I WILL BE LEAVING.

1196
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,230
           HOW'S THE OLD TICKER?

1197
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:51,166
OH, IT'S BETTER.

1198
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:06,215
   IF YOU WAIT TWO MORE SECONDS,
   I'M GOING TO GO.

1199
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,966
                  IT IS TOO SOON
                  FOR ME TO ASK

1200
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:27,536
                IF I COULD SLEEP
                HERE TONIGHT?

1201
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:30,038
                       TO SLEEP?

1202
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,941
WHAT STEP'S THAT?

1203
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,244
                I'VE LOST COUNT.

1204
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,065
                   GOOD MORNING.

1205
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,068
YUP, IT'S MORNING.

1206
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,070
          IT'S NOT A SO-SO DATE.

1207
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:04,106
               ¶¶

1208
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:05,674
             YOU PLAY SUBLIMELY.

1209
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:08,143
NO. SO-SO.

1210
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:11,847
               UH-UH. SUBLIMELY.

1211
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,557
HELLO, ARMANDE.
HOW'S YOUR ARM?

1212
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,824
                           UH...

1213
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,593
          IT'S, UH...

1214
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,704
           DAD? DAD?

1215
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,910
              DAD?

1216
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:50,285
DAD?

1217
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:00,329
DAD? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1218
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:01,830
                  TAKING A BATH.

1219
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:04,366
UH, ARE YOU OKAY?

1220
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:05,934
            WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

1221
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:12,107
I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN YOU
TAKE A BATH AT THIS HOUR.

1222
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,344
            OOH, STOP THE PRESS.
            HOLD THE FRONTPAGE.

1223
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:17,779
                "MAN TAKING BATH
                IN AFTERNOON."

1224
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,749
AND, UM...

1225
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,718
WHAT'S THIS?
                A PAIR OF SHOES.

1226
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,722
IS IT LAVERNE'S?

1227
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:32,894
OH, I BET IT'S THAT WOMAN
WHO LIVES ACROSS THE HALL!

1228
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,297
DAD--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1229
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,899
   I'M DOING WHAT
   I SHOULD HAVE DONE YEARS AGO.

1230
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:41,370
NOW, WOULD YOU MIND LEAVING ME
AND CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND YOU?

1231
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:45,007
DOES JOHN KNOW?
            IT'S MY LIFE, LYDIA!

1232
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:47,342
 IF I WANT TO STOP TAKING PILLS,
 I'LL STOP TAKING PILLS.

1233
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,810
        IF I WANT TO HAVE A BATH
        IN THE AFTERNOON,

1234
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,312
                I'LL TAKE A BATH
                IN THE--

1235
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,847
           OH, AND WHILE
           WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT,

1236
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,382
              I'VE FOUND LAVERNE
              A NEW JOB.

1237
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:54,916
           IF YOU WANT,
           GO DOWN TO THE LOBBY.

1238
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,119
      SHE'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

1239
01:00:57,121 --> 01:01:00,656
BUT WHY--
BUT WHY, DAD?

1240
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,824
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A BABY.

1241
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,660
                I'LL TAKE THAT
                AS A COMPLIMENT.

1242
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:07,429
       NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

1243
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:11,033
                           DOOR!

1250
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:30,686
       I LIKE PLAYING IT FOR ME.

1251
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:32,187
            I LOVE IT.
            IT'S SO STIMULATING.

1252
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,389
      IT'S LIKE POURING CAFFEINE
      INTO YOUR EARS.

1253
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:36,191
YOU'RE CRAZY.

1254

YOU'RE A CRAZY, INSANE,
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

1255
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:40,796

   THESE CANVASSES REPRESENT

01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:49,030
     MY DREAMS
     OF THE LAST FEW YEARS,

1271
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:52,200
   AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE THEM
   WITH YOU.

1272
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:55,971
  I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE SHOW
  WITH MY FAVORITE CREATION...

1273
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:58,473
         "EXPLOSION--"

1274
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:00,175
SHE'S HERE.

1275
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:01,843
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

1276
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:04,312
    MY CAR WAS IN THE SHOP.

1277
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:09,518
            "EXPLOSION OF PAIN."

1278
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:22,030
             ENJOY.

1279
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,804
     THIS IS MY BOYFRIEND, FRED.

1280
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,038
OH, HELLO.

1281
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,207
     THIS IS MY ELDEST, RAYMOND.

1282
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:34,009
            AND HIS WIFE, LAURA.

1283
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:35,844
                OH, LAURA.
HI.

1284
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:38,046
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

1285
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:40,148
                 YES, THANK YOU.

1286
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,821
REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS SMALL
AND HE WOULD DO THOSE DRAWINGS?

1287
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:49,090
I FOUND THEM
ABSOLUTELY ENCHANTING.

1288
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:54,229
AND YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU LIKED ARITHMETIC.

1289
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:56,097
FRED?

1290
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,999
        FRED, I'VE HEARD
        A LOT ABOUT YOU.

1291
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,467
YES, THIS IS HIM.

1292
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:01,102
           SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1293
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:04,206
UH, OH, IT'S VERY...

1294
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,574
INTENSE.

1295
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:09,144
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT I ADMIRE YOUR DEDICATION

1296
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,379
AS A MAN
AS MUCH AS AN ARTIST.

1297
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:15,083
ALL ALONE WITH FIVE KIDS.
THAT'S GOT TO BE VERY DIFFICULT.

1298
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:16,852
      I DON'T HAVE
      ANY CHILDREN, FRED.

1299
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:19,387
   RAYMOND IS THE FAMILY MAN,
   BUT HE'S ONLY GOT ONE.

1300
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:22,557
                     A DAUGHTER.

1301
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,594
       OH, THAT MUST BE
       POOR LITTLE APRIL.

1302
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,972
FRED?

1303
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:40,108
     I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!
     YOU EMBELLISHED EVERYTHING.

1304
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:42,577
 THAT STORY ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN
 WAS HEARTBREAKING!

1305
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:45,413
BUT, FRED,
IF A STORY HAS TO BE SAD,

1306
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:47,549
IT HAS TO BE REALLY,
REALLY SAD.

1307
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:51,286
I COULDN'T SETTLE
FOR A SO-SO SAD STORY.

1308
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,955
YOU KNOW,
IT EXCITED MY IMAGINATION.

1309
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:56,524
HEY, GRANDMA!
HEY, GRAMPS!

1310
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:58,426
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
GO TUCK YOURSELVES IN?

1311
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:02,063
           YOU KEEP OUT OF THIS,
           SONNY BOY!

1312
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,065
NOW, LOOK, WHY--

1313
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,568
             WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
             TELL ME THE TRUTH?

1314
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,904
         WERE YOU AFRAID
         THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK
         FOR THE MONEY BACK?

1315
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,639
I'LL GIVE IT
ALL BACK TO YOU.

1316
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:13,174
     YEAH, WELL, THE MONEY WAS
     FOR ALEC'S SHOW, WASN'T IT?

1317
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:16,645
BUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH
A FEW THINGS NOT ADDING UP?

1318
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:20,148
IF YOU TOLD ME TOMORROW THAT
LYDIA WAS NOT YOUR DAUGHTER,

1319
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,950
I WOULDN'T CARE.

1320
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:23,485
           ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
           OKAY, OKAY.

1321
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:25,420
    LET'S FORGET THE WHOLE THING
    AND START OVER.

1322
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,455
YEAH.
                      ALL RIGHT.

1323
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,190
      WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU TOLD ME
      THAT WASN'T TRUE?

1324
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:30,525
NOTHING.
                   OH, YOU SURE?

1325
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,127
YES. POSITIVE.

1326
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,162
A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE.

1327
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:37,265
THIS IS MY FRED.
THIS IS HOW I LIKE YOU.

1328
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,566
                         WELL...

1329
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:43,438
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT FRED?

1330
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,174
             DO YOU LIKE HIM?
             HE'S HANDSOME, HUH?

1331
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:47,976
WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?
I MEAN...

1332
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:51,212
WHAT PURPOSE DOES IT SERVE
AT THIS POINT?

1333
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:54,015
       ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
       THAT I'M TOO OLD?

1334
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:55,984
NO, I'M...
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

1335
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:58,186
YOU'RE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE.

1336
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,588
            OH, THAT'S ODD,
            COMING FROM SOMEBODY

1337
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:04,993
              WHO'S BEEN MARRIED
              THREE TIMES.

1338
01:06:04,995 --> 01:06:07,529
               THE PURPOSE IS...

1339
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:11,199
              WE MAKE EACH OTHER
              SO HAPPY.

1340
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:16,504
DOES HE KNOW YOU'RE SICK?

1341
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,039
                             NO.

1342
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,709
              AND IT'S YOUR HEAD
              IF YOU TELL HIM.

1343
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,982
          OKAY. NOW,
          TELL ME I'M BEAUTIFUL.

1344
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,217
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

1345
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,719
                         ALMOST.

1346
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,191
IS THE CAR RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE FRONT DOOR?

1347
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:39,227
WHY? WHY ARE YOU SO NERVOUS
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

1348
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,631
                 SO WHAT ARE YOU
                 DRAWING THERE?

1349
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:46,201
JUST DRAWING
A LITTLE HEART.

1350
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,105
AH-HA!

1351
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:51,773
OH, YOU'RE ALL DOLLED UP.

1352
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,743
MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY.

1353
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:56,745
MOM...
HI, FRED.

1354
01:06:56,747 --> 01:06:58,747
   HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND.
   WHY DON'T YOU INVITE HIM?

1355
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:01,383
OH, HE WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED
IN THIS, HONEY.

1356
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:03,385
CHILDREN SCREAMING
ALL OVER THE PLACE

1357
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:06,588
AND JUNK FOOD AND BALLOONS
AND VOMIT EVERYWHERE.

1358
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,423
NO, NO, NO.
YOU'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO.

1359
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:10,025
WELL, ACTUALLY, I DON'T.

1360
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:13,061
          WELL, GOOD THEN.
          IT'S SETTLED. COME ON.

1361
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:15,363
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

1362
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,775
ARE YOU UPSET
THAT I CAME?

1363
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:28,777
                 NO. NOT AT ALL.

1364
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:31,679
OH. YOU SURE?
                   I'M POSITIVE.

1365
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,214
YOU'RE LOOKING
KIND OF STRANGE.

1366
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:36,317
             WELL, I AM STRANGE.

1367
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,587
                       OH, ALEC!

1368
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:41,456
OH, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, SIR.

1369
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,457
                GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1370
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,392
       IS THIS YOUR GIFT TO HER?

1371
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,127
"COUNTRY MORNING."
       OH. UH-HUH.

1372
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,395
SEEMED LIKE THE MOST
APPROPRIATE PAINTING

1373
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,830
FOR A GIRL OF HER AGE.

1374
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:52,333
         HOW IS THIS APPROPRIATE
         FOR HER AGE, ALEC?

1375
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:53,401
IS THAT A DEAD DUCK?

1376
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,336
YES.

1377
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:56,671
 YES, IT IS.

1378
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,339
IT'LL BE WORTH CRAZY MONEY
IN A FEW YEARS,

1379
01:07:58,341 --> 01:07:59,474
AND SHE COULD SELL IT

1380
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:00,708
AND BUY ALL THE WEED
SHE CAN SMOKE.

1381
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,179
OKAY, COME ON, EVERYONE.
LET'S, UH...

1382
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,648
LET'S DO THE PHOTOGRAPH NOW.
FRED? YEAH.

1383
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,716
MOM, COME ON.
COME ON. COME ON.

1384
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,219
     IS YOUR FATHER COMING?

1385
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,420
                  AT THIS POINT,
                  I DOUBT IT.

1386
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,155
          THAT'S GOOD.
                            WHY?

1387
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:16,424
      BECAUSE I TOLD FRED
      I WAS A WIDOW.

1388
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,126
                       MOM! WHY?

1389
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:20,829
      I DON'T KNOW.
      IT JUST SLIPPED OUT.

1390
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:23,631
             YEAH.

1391
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:26,734
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY SMILE REAL BIG!

1392
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:28,203
 READY? HERE WE GO.
                           YEAH.

1393
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:31,172
BIG SMILES.
                YES. VERY GOOD.

1394
01:08:31,174 --> 01:08:32,774
                   NO, NO. WAIT!

1395
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,778
      GRANDPA HAS ARRIVED.

1396
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,346
GRAMPS!

1397
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:41,349
            GRANDPA!

1398
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:45,753
                 SON OF A BITCH.
                 HE SHOWED.

1399
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,655
IS THAT YOUR WIFE'S FATHER?

1400
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,858
NO, IT'S MY FATHER.

1401
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,530
YAY! GRANDPA!
COME ON, GRANDPA!

1402
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:56,898
 COME GET IN THE PHOTO!

1403
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,600
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

1404
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:00,869
REAL BIG NOW! READY?

1405
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:02,270
SQUEEZE TOGETHER
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

1406
01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:04,839
BIG SMILES NOW.

1407
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,674
      YOU LIKE DOING THIS TO ME,
      DON'T YOU?

1408
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:08,877
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO YOU, FRED.

1409
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:12,147
   IF I DID ANYTHING TO ANYBODY,
   IT WAS TO MY EX-HUSBAND.

1410
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,382
           I KILLED HIM
           AND WITH GOOD REASON.

1411
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:15,783
OH, YEAH?
AND WHAT WAS THAT?

1412
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,452
         BECAUSE HE LET ME DOWN.

1413
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:18,920
         I HOPE I NEVER
         LET YOU DOWN.

1414
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:22,891
OH, FRED.
HE WAS SO UNFAITHFUL.

1415
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:24,492
WHEN I FIND OUT--

1416
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,461
HAVING AN AFFAIR--

1417
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:29,898
I CONFRONTED HIM
AND HE DENIED IT OBVIOUSLY.

1418
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,766
SO I NEEDED
TO FOLLOW HIM

1419
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,536
AND, UH, CATCH HIM
IN THE ACT, SO TO SPEAK.

1420
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:36,771
DID YOU DRAW HIM OUT?

1421
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:41,176
NO, I WENT TO LONDON
WITH SOME GIRLFRIENDS.

1422
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:42,744
AND WE WENT
TO A REAL STRIP CLUB.

1423
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:45,480
AFTER THE SHOW,
ONE OF THE BOYS CAME BACK.

1424
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:47,382
OH, HE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

1425
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,317
HE WAS VERY TALL
AND DARK AND HANDSOME.

1426
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:51,486
HE HAD BLUE EYES.
HIS NAME WAS STEVE.

1427
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:56,391
AND HE LOOKED INTO MY FACE,
AND I SAID, "HOW MUCH?"

1428
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:59,594
AND HE CAME TO MY ROOM
AND HE WAS SO AFFECTIONATE.

1429
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:02,363
AND HE WAS--
HE WAS HOT.

1430
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,632
WHEN I GOT BACK,

1431
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,769
I TOLD MAX EVERYTHING.

1432
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,939
AND HE GOT SO ANGRY,
AND I SAID, "WHY ARE YOU ANGRY?

1433
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:13,841
YOU CAN DO THIS SORT OF THING
AND I CAN'T?"

1434
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:17,645
AND HE SAID,
"YES, BECAUSE I'M A MAN."

1435
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:20,415
WELL, I DID IT.
I BURIED HIM RIGHT THERE.

1436
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:21,916
SO NOW YOU KNOW
WHY I KILLED HIM.

1437
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,719
EVERYTHING YOU SAY
              TO ME--

1438
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,721
          SEEMS LIKE SUCH A LIE.

1439
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,591
          THE STRIPPER, PICASSO,
          THE PORTRAIT.

1440
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:32,327
OH, I CAN GET THE PORTRAIT
BY PICASSO.

1441
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:33,528
IT'S IN MY SAFE.

1442
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,364
          COME ON, LET'S SEE IT.

1443
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,866
NO. IF WE'RE GOING
TO TRUST EACH OTHER,

1444
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:41,569
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME
WITHOUT PROOF.

1445
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,375
                         ELSA...

1446
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:50,945
       I WISH I COULD TRUST YOU.

1447
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:52,981
       AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

1448
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,517
                         PERIOD!

1449
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:58,453
FRED.

1450
01:10:58,455 --> 01:10:59,921
 <i> FRED!</i>
           <i> YOU'RE A LIAR, ELSA!</i>

1451
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:02,624
<i> FRED, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?</i>
              <i> A SHAMELESS LIAR.</i>

1452
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:04,726
OH, LYDIA.

1453
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:06,995
IF YOUR CAR GETS SMACKED,
IT WASN'T ME.

1454
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,797
       DAD, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1455
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:12,400
      FOR A WALK!
      IN THE FUCKING PARK!

1456
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:16,904
       DAD. HOLD ON, DAD.

1457
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:19,040
         OKAY, WHAT IS GOING ON?

1458
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:22,277
HMM? I MEAN, MOM IS BARELY
      COLD IN THE GRAVE,

1459
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,745
   AND YOU'RE SEEING THAT WOMAN?

1460
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:24,979
WOULD YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

1461
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,848
            THIS IS MY BUSINESS.

1462
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,716
        SHE IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU.
        LOOK AT YOU.

1463
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,652
                 YOU'RE ALL RED.
SO I'M RED. SO WHAT?

1464
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:31,853
            WELL, AT YOUR AGE...

1465
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:33,688
OH, AT MY AGE,
I CAN'T BE RED?

1466
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,690
WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER?
GREEN? BLUE?

1467
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:38,626
JUST STOP STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO MY BUSINESS!

1468
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,495
AND GIVE ME BACK
THE COPY OF YOUR KEYS.

1469
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:41,729
                           BUT--
GIVE THEM BACK TO ME!

1470
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,831
                 WHAT IF THERE'S
                 AN EMERGENCY?

1471
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,867
CALL THE SUPER.

1472
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:48,436
        GOOD-BYE, LYDIA!

1473
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,576
WHY DID YOU COME?

1474
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:57,979
         BECAUSE, ON THURSDAY...

1475
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,448
    WE HAVE TO SIGN THE CONTRACT
    FOR THE WAREHOUSE.

1476
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,584
AND I HAVE TO ORDER
ALL OF THE "CAN'T LOSE" GLASSES,

1477
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:06,521
            AND I WANTED TO KNOW
            IF YOU'D DECIDED.

1478
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:09,390
WELL, I HAVE.

1479
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:11,426
                            AND?
I'LL DO IT.

1480
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:13,494
                     REALLY? OH!

1481
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,729
                            OH!

1482
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:16,064
STOP BY BEFORE SIGNING.

1483
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:17,665
WE'LL GO TO THE BANK
AND WRITE THE CHECK.

1484
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,634
                OKAY. THANK YOU.

1485
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:20,702
                     THANK YOU.
GOOD-BYE, LYDIA.

1486
01:12:28,078 --> 01:12:30,044
                        OH, GOD!

1487
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:33,081
    LYDIA, WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW?

1488
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,586
                             OH.
GOOD EVENING.

1489
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:40,588
       OH, GOOD EVENING.
       WELL, YOU WOULD SHOW UP--

1490
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:44,025
COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED,
          TONIGHT OF ALL NIGHTS!

1491
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,060
               WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WE NEED TO TALK.

1492
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,995
                     ABOUT WHAT?

1493
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,098
CAN I COME IN?
                            YES.

1494
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:56,637
MAY I SIT DOWN?

1495
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,406
                YEAH, OF COURSE.
                OF COURSE.

1496
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:01,676
         NOW, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
         IF YOU ARE HER HUSBAND,

1497
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:04,479
              HER EX-HUSBAND,
              HER DEAD HUSBAND--

1498
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,381
SHE TOLD YOU
I WAS DEAD?

1499
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:07,949
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME.

1500
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:10,952
         UH, FREDERICK BARCROFT.
MAX. MAXWELL HAYES.

1501
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:13,388
LOOK, FRED,
ELSA, MY WIFE...

1502
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,423
SHE'S VERY DANGEROUS.

1503
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:16,657
           YOU'RE STILL MARRIED?

1504
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,126
WELL, TECHNICALLY.

1505
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:20,128
IT MEANS NOTHING.
IT WAS LONG AGO.

1506
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,131
BUT SHE CONFUSES REALITY
WITH HER IMAGINATION.

1507
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:25,500
SHE LIES,
AND THEN SHE BELIEVES
HER OWN LIES,

1508
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:27,635
AS IF THEY WERE TRUE.

1509
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,103
I LOVED HER
WITH ALL MY HEART.

1510
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,471
         YEAH,
         BUT YOU CHEATED ON HER.

1511
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:32,140
AFTER SHE CHEATED ON ME.

1512
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:34,442
            NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE!
OH, SHE'S GOT YOU
BELIEVING THAT.

1513
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:36,144
WELL, THAT'S WHAT'S
SO DANGEROUS ABOUT HER.

1514
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:38,446
SEE, SHE TRANSFORMS
HER FANTASIES

1515
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:39,981
INTO SOMETHING REAL.

1516
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:43,651
WHEN SHE CHEATED ON ME,
I CAUGHT HER RED-HANDED.

1517
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,753
          YOU MEAN THAT YOU WENT
          ALL THE WAY TO LONDON

1518
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,455
        TO CATCH HER IN THE ACT?

1519
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:48,623
SHE'S NEVER BEEN
TO LONDON!

1520
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:51,025
IT WAS HERE,
IN NEW ORLEANS.

1521
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,664
              I NEED A DRINK.
              YOU WANT ANYTHING?

1522
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,166
NO, NOTHING FOR ME.

1523
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:01,903
I DON'T DRINK, HARDLY.
WELL, SHE SAID I WAS A DRUNK.

1524
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:03,638
THAT'S ONE THING
SHE THREW IN MY FACE.

1525
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,939
YOU KNOW,
ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

1526
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,774
SHE'LL DRIVE YOU
TO INSANITY.

1527
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:10,144
 SHE LIVES
 IN THIS DREAM WORLD.

1528
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:12,180
DID SHE TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE ACTRESS?

1529
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:14,882
                       WHO? WHO?
THE BLONDE WITH THE BIG--
YOU KNOW--

1530
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:17,685
               OH. ANITA EKBERG.
 YEAH, HER.

1531
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:21,589
DID SHE TELL YOU ABOUT HER--
HER DREAM OF GOING TO ROME?

1532
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:23,191
TO THE FOUNTAIN?
                     YEAH, YEAH.

1533
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:25,526
            BUT SHE TOLD ME
            THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
            TO TAKE HER THERE.

1534
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,595
SHE WANTED TO GET
INTO THE FOUNTAIN,

1535
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:28,896
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

1536
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:30,932
AND-AND DRESS UP LIKE--
WHAT'S-HER-NAME?

1537
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:33,501
AND I HAD TO DRESS UP
LIKE THAT OTHER GUY

1538
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:35,970
IN THE MOVIE.

1539
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,839
IT WAS MADNESS.
AND FOR WHAT?

1540
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:39,941
WHAT?
TO GET ARRESTED?

1541
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:45,012
I JUST CAME HERE TODAY
TO WARN YOU.

1542
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:47,014
                ONE SECOND, MAX.

1543
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:51,018
                     IS IT TRUE?

1544
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,120
        THAT WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG,
        SHE...

1545
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:56,057
              SHE LOOKED
              LIKE ANITA EKBERG?

1546
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:59,760
NO, THAT'S A LIE.

1547
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:02,196
SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL.
SHE WAS FANTASTIC.

1548
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:04,165
SHE WAS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL BLONDE

1549
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,234
IN ALL OF NEW ORLEANS.

1550
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,105
DON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE.

1551
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:13,174
LETTING ELSA GO...

1552
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:16,744
IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF MY LIFE.

1553
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,608
             ELSA!

1554
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:49,644
ELSA, WHAT IS IT?

1555
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:51,579
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

1556
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:55,049
  NO, FRED.
  LET'S TALK TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

1557
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,590
YOU'RE MY LIFE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

1558
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,899
YES. FOLLOW THAT CAB,
WILL YOU?

1559
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,311
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE ME HOME.

1560
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,376
             ELSA?

1561
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,282
             ELSA?

1562
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:39,854
ELSA?

1563
01:17:39,856 --> 01:17:41,322
            I'M IN THE BATHROOM.

1564
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:45,993
I'VE COOKED YOU DINNER.

1565
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,294
                     I'M COMING.

1566
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,168
YOU'VE HARDLY
EATEN ANYTHING.

1567
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,403
            I'M JUST NOT HUNGRY.

1568
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:57,138
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GET YOU SOME TEA?

1569
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,375
                 I JUST WANT YOU
                 TO HOLD ME.

1570
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,826
THIS SCENE IS PRACTICALLY
PORNOGRAPHIC.

1571
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:21,862
WHAT A WOMAN.

1572
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,798
           JOHN, CAN I ASK,
           WHAT IS THE PROGNOSIS

1573
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,867
              FOR SOMEONE
              WHO'S ON DIALYSIS?

1574
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,236
IT DEPENDS.
                        ON WHAT?

1575
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:31,038
THE GENERAL STATE
OF THE PERSON,

1576
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,773
LIFESTYLE, AGE.

1577
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,476
WHAT ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE, FRED?

1578
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:38,779
         OH, ELSA'S ON DIALYSIS.

1579
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:40,314
          I WAS WONDERING WHAT--

1580
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:42,917
               WHAT IS THE BEST
               POSSIBLE OUTLOOK?

1581
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:46,220
I'D HAVE TO KNOW
HER HISTORY, BUT...

1582
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,456
              BUT WHAT? TELL ME.

1583
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,324
LET'S SAY
IT'S NOT VERY PROMISING

1584
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:54,061
FOR A PERSON OF HER AGE.

1585
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,797
                SHE'LL DIE, HUH?

1586
01:18:56,799 --> 01:19:00,234
WE ALL DIE EVENTUALLY.

1587
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:03,170
I'M AN IDIOT.

1588
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:06,474
YES, YOU ARE AN IDIOT,
MY FRIEND.

1589
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:09,343
                WHAT TIME IS IT?

1590
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:11,479
IT'S A QUARTER TO 5:00.
WHY?

1591
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,483
                   COME WITH ME.

1592
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,088
               ¶¶

1593
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,525
GOOD EVENING.

1594
01:19:57,527 --> 01:19:59,326
                THANK YOU, FRED.

1595
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:01,328
       IS THIS WHAT YOU'VE
       BEEN DOING ALL AFTERNOON?

1596
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,998
WHAT PLANS DO YOU HAVE
FOR THE NEXT WEEK?

1597
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,199
                  UH, EXCUSE ME?

1598
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:07,268
UM...

1599
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:10,437
OPEN IT.
                   WHAT IS THIS?

1600
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:13,541
READ IT, PLEASE.

1601
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,544
TICKETS!

1602
01:20:16,546 --> 01:20:18,913
ROME.
YOUR CITY, I BELIEVE?

1603
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:21,348
                   AH! OH, FRED!

1604
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,818
                I'M GOING TO DIE
                OF EXCITEMENT.

1605
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,987
OH, I HOPE NOT.

1606
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,562
              OH.

1607
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,568
               ¶¶

1608
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:47,575
               ¶¶

1609
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,096
YOU KNOW, IN THE PORTRAIT
THAT PABLO DID OF ME,

1610
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:10,531
HE DID MY ARM.

1611
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:14,435
YES. BUT THEN, MY HAND WAS
COMING OUT OF MY SHOULDER.

1612
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:16,570
YOU'RE ADORABLE,

1613
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:21,442
        EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVE
        A THIRD OF WHAT YOU SAY.

1614
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:23,210
YOU DON'T BELIEVE...

1615
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,346
THAT PABLO PICASSO DID
A PORTRAIT OF ME?

1616
01:21:28,184 --> 01:21:30,951
I CANNOT BE WITH SUCH
A MISTRUSTING MAN.

1617
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:32,653
                  OKAY, OKAY.
                  I BELIEVE YOU.

1618
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:36,156
                 I BELIEVE YOU.

1619
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,498
    SHALL I TELL HIM
    TO PASS BY THE FOUNTAIN?

1620
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,033
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1621
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:48,636
I WANT TO DISCOVER IT
AT NIGHT, LIKE ANITA.

1622
01:21:48,638 --> 01:21:51,238
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN I'M READY.

1623
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,642
               ¶¶

1624
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:34,548
YOU SMILE.

1625
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:55,102
   OH, FRED,
   THIS IS ALL SO EXTRAORDINARY.

1626
01:22:56,605 --> 01:23:00,174
    I BET IT COST YOU A FORTUNE.
    DID YOU TAKE OUT A LOAN?

1627
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:01,375
NO, I STOLE THE MONEY.

1628
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:02,977
NO, COME ON.

1629
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:04,979
            WELL, I JUST HAD IT,
            THAT'S ALL.

1630
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:07,448
I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT

1631
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:09,516
YOU WOULD SPEND IT
ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1632
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:11,218
YOU KNOW, ONCE UPON A TIME,

1633
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,588
 SOMEONE TOLD ME,
 OVER AN ABSURD RESTAURANT BILL,

1634
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:17,758
                THAT SOME THINGS
                ARE PRICELESS.

1635
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,265
OH. DID YOU SEE HOW
THEY WERE LOOKING AT YOU?

1636
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:27,167
                          HELLO?

1637
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:30,371
THIS MAN IS MINE!

1638
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:36,410
DAD? IN THE BATHROOM?
I DON'T KNOW.

1639
01:23:36,412 --> 01:23:38,278
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1640
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,613
         IT'S TYPICAL.

1641
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:41,015
          COME ON.
          LET'S CHECK THE SUPER.

1642
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:42,783
HE LEFT.

1643
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:45,185
BUT HE TOLD ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

1644
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:48,022
            HE LEFT?

1645
01:23:48,024 --> 01:23:51,191
"DEAR LYDIA,
ABOUT THE INVESTMENT THAT--"

1646
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,660
       I THINK THAT
       IF IT SAYS "DEAR LYDIA,"
       THAT IT'S FOR ME TO READ.

1647
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:55,396
    "DEAR LYDIA,
    I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

1648
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:56,597
    "THE INVESTMENT THAT
    YOU AND JACK SUGGESTED,

1649
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:59,166
           "AND I...

1650
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:01,535
"I DECIDED TO BACK OUT.

1651
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,504
 "I REALIZE THAT THIS WILL COME
 AS A SURPRISE TO YOU,

1652
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:06,607
 "AND THAT YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND
 WHY I'M ACTING THE WAY I DO.

1653
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:08,809
     WELL, I DO.
     I'M CURRENTLY IN RO--"

1654
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:10,344
           IN ROME?!

1655
01:24:10,346 --> 01:24:13,047
                           WHAT?
        IN ROME WITH ELSA!

1656
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:15,115
             UH...

1657
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:18,152
      "I DECIDED TO INVEST
      IN OUR HAPPINESS.

1658
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:21,722
    "I'M SURE THAT
    YOU'LL MAKE THINGS WORK,
    IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

1659
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:22,723
                        OH, HE--

1660
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,392
    "ONE MORE THING, LYDIA.

1661
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,127
   I BELIEVE THAT I WASN'T--"

1662
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:28,695
   OH, MY GOD. "I WASN'T
   A VERY GOOD FATHER TO YOU.

1663
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:30,664
        "AND I'M SORRY.

1664
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:33,100
 "REALLY, IF IN THE NEXT LIFE,
 I'M STILL YOUR FATHER,

1665
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:34,368
     "I'LL TRY
     TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

1666
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,503
DAD."

1667
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:39,640
    HE'S EVEN TRYING TO BE FUNNY
    WHILE HE SCREWS US OVER.

1668
01:24:39,642 --> 01:24:41,842
SAY SOMETHING, LYDIA.

1669
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:44,211
               MY FATHER'S JUST
               NEVER APOLOGIZED.

1670
01:24:44,213 --> 01:24:46,080
     THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
     HE'S EVER APOLOGIZED TO ME.

1671
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:48,382
HE'S WASTING HIS MONEY
ON THAT OLD BROAD!

1672
01:24:48,384 --> 01:24:50,551
    INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN YOU?

1673
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:54,488
         NO, HE'S NOT INTERESTED
         IN THE BUSINESS, JACK!

1674
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:57,458
 AND, FRANKLY, NEITHER AM I.
 HONESTLY, IF YOU WANT TO DO IT,

1675
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,159
           YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND
           A WAY TO DO IT

1676
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:00,861
      WITH YOUR OWN MONEY, OKAY?

1677
01:25:00,863 --> 01:25:02,830
          I LOVE YOU.

1678
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,305
WELL, LET'S GO...

1679
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:13,640
TO THE FOUNTAIN TONIGHT.

1680
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:15,776
                      ALL RIGHT.

1681
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:17,578
THE CAT.

1682
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,346
                 CAT? WHICH CAT?

1683
01:25:19,348 --> 01:25:22,583
THE CAT HAS TO BE EXACTLY
LIKE ANITA'S CAT IN THE MOVIE.

1684
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:24,251
IT HAS TO BE WHITE AND SMALL.

1685
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:27,521
    BUT ELSA, WHERE DO YOU THINK
    I'M GOING TO--

1686
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:28,822
OH, PLEASE, FRED.

1687
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:30,457
I'VE DREAMED ABOUT THIS
FOR SO LONG.

1688
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:34,561
IT'S GOT TO BE EXACTLY
LIKE I DREAMED IT, PLEASE.

1689
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,231
BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

1690
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:45,933
TAKE YOUR TIME.

1691
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:06,520
              WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1692
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:08,522
WHAT CAN I SAY?

1693
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,698
                 I'M SO NERVOUS.

1694
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,399
<i> IL GATTO,</i> HMM?

1695
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,370
        NO, BUT NOT UNTIL WE GET
        TO THE FOUNTAIN.

1696
01:27:23,372 --> 01:27:24,671
<i> AMORE, ANDIAMO?</i>

1697
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:26,974
                       <i> ANDIAMO.</i>

1698
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,924
              I WISH I COULD'VE
              BROUGHT YOU HERE
              IN THE SUMMERTIME.

1699
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:47,561
NO, FRED. YOU BROUGHT ME.
YOU'RE AN ABSOLUTE ANGEL.

1700
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:51,431
OH! SHH.

1701
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:53,967
THE KITTEN.
LET ME HAVE THE KITTEN.

1702
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:55,702
OH.
                 SORRY, I TRIED.

1703
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:58,005
              IT'S ALMOST WHITE.
OH, THAT'S MY BABY.

1704
01:27:58,007 --> 01:27:59,573
LET'S JUST COVER HER.

1705
01:27:59,575 --> 01:28:01,008
NO. WELL,
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY

1706
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,477
ANITA AND MARCELLO
EITHER, ARE WE?

1707
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:06,346
OH,
                           WHAT?

1708
01:28:06,348 --> 01:28:07,881
DO YOU HAVE A GLASS OF MILK
FOR THE CAT?

1709
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:10,517
             WHAT GLASS OF MILK?
NO, WHEN THEY GOT HERE,

1710
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:12,419
JUST ABOUT HERE,
BUT NOT EXACTLY--

1711
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:13,620
I DON'T THINK--

1712
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,889
SHE SENT HIM OFF
TO A DAIRY STORE

1713
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:17,524
TO BUY MILK FOR THE CAT.

1714
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,793
           ELSA, MARCELLO DIDN'T
           GO TO A DAIRY STORE.

1715
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,728
            ONE OF THE FILM CREW
            GOT HIM THE MILK.

1716
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,497
MM, PLEASE, FRED?

1717
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:25,666
FRED, FRED, FRED.
           ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

1718
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:27,834
OH, MY...
                  YOU ALL RIGHT?

1719
01:28:27,836 --> 01:28:29,036
YES.
             JUST STAY THERE.
             I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1720
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:30,637
OH, YES.

1721
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:41,108
        SORRY.
        I COULD ONLY GET YOGURT.

1722
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,880
            TASTE IT. IT'S GOOD.

1723
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:50,117
                     IT'S GOOD.

1724
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:53,120
MARCELLO, COME HERE.

1725
01:29:53,122 --> 01:29:56,656
              WE'RE GOING TO DIE
              OF PNEUMONIA!

1726
01:29:56,658 --> 01:29:59,593
WOULD THIS BE SUCH
A TERRIBLE PLACE TO DIE?

1727
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:15,142
                 HE CARESSES HER
                 WITH HIS EYES.

1728
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:19,413
               HE ADORES HER
               AS IF SHE WERE...

1729
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:22,849
                      A GODDESS.

1730
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:25,986
             AND THEN, IT'S JUST
             THE TWO OF THEM...

1731
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,157
         ALL ALONE IN THE WORLD.

1732
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:34,728
          THE SOUND OF THE WATER
          DISAPPEARS.

1733
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:37,097
           MY LOVE, MY MARCELLO,

1734
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:41,067
            I'M GOING TO CONFESS
            SOMETHING NOW.

1735
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:49,176
   I LOVE YOU MORE THAN
   I HAVE EVER LOVED ANY PERSON.

1736
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,112
                      THANK YOU.

1737
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:55,215
NO. THANK YOU.

1738
01:30:55,217 --> 01:30:56,683
THANK YOU.

1739
01:30:56,685 --> 01:31:00,821
THANK YOU.

1740
01:31:00,823 --> 01:31:03,657
          I LOVE YOU.
          I LOVE YOU.

1741
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:14,728
       MANAGED TO OPEN THE SAFE.

1742
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:17,531
    SHE LEFT ME A NOTE.
    SHE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS.
