1
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:51,754
If I spoke about it.

2
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:53,991
If I did.

3
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:57,004
What would I tell you?

4
00:01:57,814 --> 00:01:59,029
I wonder?

5
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:03,272
Would I tell you about the time?

6
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,115
It happened a long time ago-
It seems...

7
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,538
In the last days of a
fair Prince's reign...

8
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:13,643
Or would I tell you about the place?

9
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:16,324
A small city near the coast

10
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,061
but far from everything else...

11
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:24,710
Or, I don't know.

12
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,761
Would I tell you about her?

13
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,318
The princess without voice

14
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,116
Or perhaps I would just warn you

15
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,060
about the truth of these facts

16
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,647
and the tale of love and loss

17
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,662
and the monster

18
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:49,144
that tried to destroy it all...

19
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,170
<i>My Lord Hedak.</i>

20
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:45,893
<i>So, you are troubled.</i>

21
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:47,502
<i>Tell me.</i>

22
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:50,887
<i>I have...</i>

23
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,195
<i>I have sinned.</i>

24
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:54,905
<i>I've offended the god.</i>

25
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,451
<i>I'm deep in sin, my Lord Hedak.</i>

26
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,296
<i>- Let me judge of that.</i>

27
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,017
<i>I've doubted the ceremony
of the sacrifice.</i>

28
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:32,358
Did the sirens wake you up?

29
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,807
It was a fire. The chocolate factory.

30
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,713
You smell that?
Oh my...

31
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,589
Toasted cocoa.

32
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,193
Tragedy and delight--
Hand in hand.

33
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:49,605
Oh dear child.

34
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,133
I'd waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

35
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,602
I am the proverbial starving.
Watch this.

36
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:00,789
Bojangles, the stair dance.

37
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,259
That's so hard.

38
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,174
Cagney did it.
Different but beautiful.

39
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:08,160
<i>I want to do that too.</i>

40
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,717
<i>All right.
Are you ready?</i>

41
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:12,052
<i>- Yep.
- Come on.</i>

42
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,498
Elisa.

43
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:00,404
Next time you're going to bring
the rent,

44
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,521
I want you to stay and
see the bible movie, huh.

45
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,489
I got... I got two free tickets here.

46
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,038
You bring your neighbor Charles.
He's a good boy.

47
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:11,174
Find a movie in comedy?
Nobody's coming to the theater, huh.

48
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:14,232
I can throw you a free popcorn
and soda.

49
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,015
Oh no, for God's sake!
There's two "S' there.

50
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:21,135
Come on. Two "S".
Mardi Grass. Mardi Grass.

51
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:34,908
Elisa, come on.
Come here already!

52
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:37,996
- You gotta learn to be on time.
- Hey, what you doing?

53
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,485
- Look her in, Dummy.
- Leave her alone, woman.

54
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,625
I was keepin' her place.

55
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,149
I get reported.
I come after you and the mute.

56
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,843
- You do that, Yolanda.

57
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:47,331
You do that.

58
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,709
My feet are already killin' me.

59
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:06,624
I made Brewster pigs in the
blanket tonight before leavin'.

60
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,326
Boy, he just ate 'em up.

61
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:14,072
No thank-yous, no yum-yums,
not a peep-

62
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,973
Man is silent as the grave.

63
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,107
But if farts were flattery

64
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,705
Honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

65
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:25,093
Then I get home and I make him breakfast.

66
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:27,749
Eggs, bacon and buttered toast.

67
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:32,608
I butter the man's toast, Elisa.
Both sides-As if he was a child...

68
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,070
And I don't even get a
“Thank You”

69
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:38,856
You'd be grateful, because
you are an educated woman.

70
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:42,624
But my Brewster, all he had gone for him
was animal magnetism back in the day

71
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,420
And workin' awhile.

72
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:47,382
What in the same hell?

73
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,557
Lou!

74
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:50,525
You boys mind puttin' the trash in the can?

75
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:51,752
That's what it's that for.

76
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,601
Hard to believe, uh?
That's what it's that for.

77
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:58,675
- Alright. Alright. Sorry Zelda, sorry.
- I don't know what they're doin'.

78
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,906
Makin' a goddamn
mess, in what I'd say.

79
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:04,115
- Zelda, stop the chatting please.
- Yes sir.

80
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:07,825
- There's no call for the blaspheme.
- Sorry, Mr. Fleming.

81
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:11,915
A moment of your time.

82
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:17,038
Today, we are receiving a new team
and asset here in T-4.

83
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:20,421
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler,
from our system facility in Galveston.

84
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:25,620
Now, I don't want to bolster
or overstate the matter but uh

85
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,947
this may very well be
the most sensitive asset

86
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,364
ever to be housed in this facility

87
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,793
- How was your trip?
- Fine.

88
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:54,293
- Who's security here?
- Just one moment please.

89
00:10:56,461 --> 00:11:00,639
Security. Who's security here?
- Welcome to T-4, sir.

90
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:04,904
Yes, sir.
I am Flemington, Head of Security...

91
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:35,881
Get them out.

92
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:39,633
Help me move the cylinder
into the compressor!

93
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,194
Bring it here.
Bring it here.

94
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,075
Elisa!
Elisa, come on.

95
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,735
What goes on in this place?
Did you see that?

96
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:24,127
Yes, I'm wearing the hair piece.
How's is it look like?

97
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,496
Careful of the car.

98
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,851
It's not a hair piece.
It's a toupee.

99
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:34,851
It's eternal, see?

100
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:37,454
Tantalus never achieved the
escape of death.

101
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:41,569
There's a fruit on the branches
was just always out of his reach.

102
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:45,407
And the water in the stream receded
every time he stooped down to drink.

103
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:48,452
And so that's why
we say things today like

104
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,639
Look at those tantalizing pies.

105
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,327
Thank you, ya'll come back, y'heah?

106
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:59,343
Yes, pies for breakfast!
Just trust me on this.

107
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,045
Hey folks, welcome to Dixie Doug's.

108
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:05,817
- I've seen you here before, right?

109
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,393
- Yes, I've been here a couple of times
as a matter of fact.

110
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:09,810
- Partial to key lime pie?

111
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,663
- Oh yeah, I am. Two to go.

112
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,709
Just go with it, please.

113
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:19,020
Uh. I-uh. It's a craving I indulge in.

114
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:22,073
It can't possibly be good for me.
Nothing that I like is...

115
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,039
No, no.
It's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

116
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,849
- You would happen to be the
famous Dixie Doug himself, huh?

117
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:30,521
- Heck, no. Pies are trucked
throughout the country.

118
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,875
- They call it uh, “franchising”, see?
- Oh.

119
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,631
They give us the spinners, the signage.
That there's “Pie Boy” our mascot.

120
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,203
I don't talk like that.

121
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,876
- I'm from Ottawa.
- No.

122
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:43,787
I completely bought it.

123
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:47,637
“That's-a-great-a-pie”

124
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:54,751
The.. The Little guy.
Is he supposed to be Italian?

125
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,717
- I guess so.

126
00:13:57,414 --> 00:13:58,345
That was very clever.

127
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,982
Y'all come back now, y'heah?

128
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:07,751
“Y'all come back now”

129
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,539
Do you think he meant it?

130
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:15,662
He had noticed me.
You heard that.

131
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:19,940
This pie is rather sordid.

132
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:25,129
Don't spit it out.
Next time we go, well try different flavor.

133
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,741
Save it for later.

134
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:46,336
Dear God, change that awfulness.
I do not want to see that.

135
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:49,294
I do not want to see it.

136
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,554
That's better. That's better.

137
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,150
Oh. Look at Betty!

138
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,701
Oh. To be young and beautiful

139
00:14:59,075 --> 00:14:59,965
If I could go back,

140
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,079
to when I was eighteen

141
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:05,369
I didn't know anything about anything.
I'd give myself a bit of advice.

142
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:11,119
I would say. Take better care of your teeth
and fuck-a lot more.

143
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:13,538
That's very good advice.

144
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:16,405
♪ Pretty baby of mine. ♪

145
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:24,233
♪ Pretty baby of mine. ♪

146
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,551
Will you look at this?

147
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,697
Look.

148
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,957
Some of the best minds in our country
peeing all over the floor in this here facility.

149
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:15,992
Mh-mh-mhm.

150
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,336
There's pee freckles on the ceiling!

151
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:21,380
How do they get it up there?

152
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,707
Just how big a target do they need,
you figure?

153
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,285
They get enough practice
that's for sure.

154
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,200
My Brewster,

155
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:35,841
no one ever called him a great mind,

156
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:36,955
but...

157
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,889
even he... Man he just hits the can
seventy percent of the time.

158
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:50,082
- Excuse us, sir.
- No, no, no. That's alright. Go ahead.

159
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,264
You ladies seem to be chatting enjoyably.

160
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,313
Girl talk no doubt.

161
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,631
Don't mind me.

162
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,378
Elisa...

163
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:13,654
Look, don't touch.

164
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:16,706
That lovely dingus right there
is an Alabama Howdy-do

165
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:20,698
Molded grip handle. Low-current,
High-voltage electric shock cattle prod.

166
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,395
Name's Strickland, Security.

167
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:25,460
Fleming's security.

168
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:39,422
Oh no, no. A man washes his hands
before or after tending to his needs.

169
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,132
That tells you a lot about that man.

170
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:44,253
If he does it both times,

171
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,516
Points to a weakness in character.

172
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:51,859
Ladies?

173
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:57,297
It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.

174
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,605
Short people are mean.

175
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,486
I've never met a short man that stays
nice all the way through.

176
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:28,303
No, sir, mean little backstabbers,
all of 'em.

177
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:32,908
Maybe it's the air down there,
not enough oxygen or somethin.

178
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,798
Help!
He's losing blood!

179
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,600
Help!
- Come on. Come on.

180
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,252
You think the Russians broke in?
I don't think so.

181
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:17,379
And If they did,
Duane's meatloaf will kill them all, honey.

182
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:19,288
It was two shots, you hear 'em?

183
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,639
Alright three, and that scream.

184
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,363
Whatever happens in this place?

185
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,064
You two.
Come with me.

186
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:30,536
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?
Any chance we might conclude our dinner?

187
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:32,286
- Now!
- Ugh.

188
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:39,939
Oh heavens to Betsy.
We're in a pickle. We're in such a pickle.

189
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,767
You will have exactly twenty minutes,

190
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,394
to render this-this lab immaculate
and so on and so forth.

191
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:55,615
Twenty minutes.

192
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,015
It's a lot of blood.

193
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,712
I can handle piss,
I can handle poop...

194
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,327
But blood? Mmm.
Blood is just something to me.

195
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:13,879
Here Hon, help me mop it up.

196
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,823
The sooner we get out of here the better.

197
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:34,138
Oh!

198
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:36,148
It's a finger!

199
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,186
It's two fingers!

200
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:42,482
Okay, okay.
Put 'em away and just wait here.

201
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,969
I'm gonna get this to Fleming.

202
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,027
Where are these body parts?

203
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,504
The body parts?

204
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,825
No, I believe you, honey.
Are you sure you it was alive?

205
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,924
Because I saw a mermaid once
in a carnival tent.

206
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:39,276
And it was a monkey sewn to the
tail of a fish. Looked real to me.

207
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,797
Alright, I apologized.

208
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:43,646
I have a deadline

209
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:45,568
You know uh...

210
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,642
Corn Flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

211
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,961
It didn't work.

212
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,101
Oh, Alice Faye just started...

213
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:58,843
She was a huge star, huge.

214
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,939
And one day she couldn't take
the bullshit, the backstabbing anymore

215
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:04,597
and she just walked away from everything.

216
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:08,660
Ta-da! It's not bad, is it?
For being shit?

217
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:13,405
Huh, listen.
You eat, you go to bed, you rest.

218
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:16,477
And when I get paid...

219
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:24,249
We get pie!
No, we don't get pie.

220
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:27,104
I get pie. You get whatever you want.

221
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:29,555
Wish me luck.

222
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:42,099
♪ You'll never know just how much ♪

223
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:46,544
♪ I miss you... ♪

224
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,422
♪ You'll never know just how much ♪

225
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:56,361
♪ I care... ♪

226
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:58,936
Green.

227
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:02,404
- They want the gelatin to be green now.
- But I was told red.

228
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:04,832
New concept.
That's the future, now.

229
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:05,697
Green.

230
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:09,191
Oh. And they want them happier-
the family.

231
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,130
Happier.
- Happier?

232
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:13,462
The Father looks like he just
discovered the missionary position

233
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:14,081
- Giles.

234
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:17,257
Well uh... What would they
supposed to be happy about?

235
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,120
I want the photographs.
I sold them on this

236
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,536
- It's too bad-this is nice work.
- It is nice, isn't it?

237
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:25,266
I think it's one of my best.

238
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:28,367
How are you holding up?

239
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:31,153
- You drinking?
- No, not a drop. No.

240
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:34,624
You get any work since you
left Klein & Saunders?

241
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,324
You mean since I was asked to leave by you.

242
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:39,671
We're not gonna get into this now.

243
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:42,123
I want to come back, Bernie

244
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,720
We'll see.

245
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:46,244
Now do this!

246
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,969
Elisa!

247
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:15,898
What are you doing in there?

248
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:19,144
Cleaning, huh?

249
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:21,339
Listen, honey.

250
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,536
Mr. “I pee with my hands on my hips”
wants to see us both.

251
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:27,401
Zelda D. Fuller.

252
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,890
How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?

253
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,551
- About ten years, Sir.

254
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:35,791
No siblings, Zelda?

255
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:37,371
- No sir...

256
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,422
That's not common, is it? For your people?

257
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:42,797
My momma died after me.

258
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,332
After I was born.

259
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:49,723
What does the “D” stand for?

260
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:52,853
Delilah, Sir.

261
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:54,649
On account of the bible.

262
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,913
Delilah.
She betrayed Samson.

263
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:00,101
Lull him to sleep, cut his hair.

264
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:03,292
Philistines torture
him, humiliate him-

265
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,527
Burn his eyes out.

266
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,273
I guess my momma didn't read
the good book close enough

267
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:11,203
- And you?

268
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,735
Elisa Esposito.

269
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:16,626
Doesn't Esposito means “Orphan”?

270
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,263
Our Lady of Sorrows Orphanage in Putnam.

271
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:23,369
They found her by the river in the water.

272
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:28,102
It was you...
that found my fingers?

273
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:31,719
Oh!
Thanks.

274
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:34,130
Three hours in surgery.

275
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,773
They rebuilt the first phalanx,
here, sutured the tendons.

276
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:41,150
Don't know if it's going
to take it or not.

277
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:43,221
There was mustard on them.

278
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:46,135
A paper bag.
- It was all we had, Sir.

279
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:49,079
I answer mostly, on account
that she can't talk.

280
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:51,454
She can't?
Is she deaf?

281
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:53,692
Mute, sir.

282
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,533
She said she can hear you.

283
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,628
All those scars on your neck.

284
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:06,764
That's what that it cut
your voice box, right?

285
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,591
She said since she was a baby.

286
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,321
Who would do that to a baby?

287
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:15,667
The world is sinful.
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

288
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,891
Well, let me say this upfront.

289
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,955
You clean that lab.
You get out.

290
00:28:22,474 --> 00:28:25,077
The thing we keep in there,
is an affront.

291
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,134
Do you know what an
affront is, Zelda?

292
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,216
- Something offensive?

293
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:31,908
That's right.
And I should know, I've dragged that...

294
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,115
...filthy thing

295
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,694
out of the river muck in South America
all the way here

296
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:42,741
And along the way we didn't get
to like each other much.

297
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,977
Now.

298
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:50,761
You may think...
that thing looks human

299
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,816
Stands on two legs, right?

300
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,790
But...
we're created in the Lord's image.

301
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:00,758
You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?

302
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,694
I wouldn't know, Sir.
What the Lord looks like.

303
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,647
Well, human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.

304
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:09,000
Or even you.

305
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,219
Maybe a little more like me, I guess.

306
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:16,550
Well, that's all.

307
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:22,102
General Hoyt.
Thank you for calling me back, Sir.

308
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,135
- You feel better?
- Oh yes, Sir. Much better.

309
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:25,492
Pain pills, is all.

310
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:29,138
- You lost two fingers. You wasn't?
- Two fingers yeah. He got two fingers.

311
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,916
But I still got my thumb, my trigger
and my pussy finger

312
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:35,767
Sounds to me like you'll be all right.
- Yes, sir, that's right.

313
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:37,646
Looking forward to your visit, Sir.

314
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:40,293
Decisions need to be made about the asset.

315
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,609
<i>...free to locations on
Downtown Portermouth.</i>

316
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,363
<i>The Future is here.</i>

317
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:24,079
Get to rest.

318
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:27,285
Pick me up on 9:30.

319
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:29,549
Twenty one hundred and thirty hours.
Yes, Sir.

320
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,051
<i>...that's great to buy.</i>

321
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,776
I'm home.

322
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:37,125
I made you an omelet!

323
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,337
- Hey Dad! Guess what?
- No pancakes?

324
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:41,181
I've gone half through the boxes.
I can't find the griddle...

325
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:42,885
I made you cheese and broccoli omelette,
- Guess what?

326
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:44,227
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?

327
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:46,457
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

328
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:50,866
- What?
- We're burying a time capsule, at the new school.

329
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,303
I wanted to ask you.

330
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,699
Do you think we'll all have jet packs,
in the future?

331
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,443
Believe it son.
- Bus is here.

332
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:01,263
This is America.

333
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:04,006
Bye dad!

334
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:12,063
Finish your omelet and wash your hands
real good and come upstairs, Sweetie.

335
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:13,864
I kinda like it here.

336
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:17,753
The kids like the lawn.
Plus, DC is just half an hour away, isn't it?

337
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,868
It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

338
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,322
You know what I'm thinking?

339
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:32,017
I'm thinking.
I need a new car.

340
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:40,856
Do you need a new car, do you?

341
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:45,362
How about a Cadillac, Mr.?

342
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:46,510
Richard.

343
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:47,939
Oh.

344
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,224
Oh

345
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,986
Oh, Richard!

346
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,535
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.
Your hand is bleeding.

347
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,985
Silence. Don't talk.
I want you in silence.

348
00:32:01,512 --> 00:32:02,242
Silence.

349
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:05,567
Silence.

350
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:09,702
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

351
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:10,345
- What?

352
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:15,767
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

353
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:18,168
And the eagle takes the prey.

354
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:18,869
- What?

355
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,567
Bob!

356
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:26,472
Elisa!
Hurry! Hurry! Come on.

357
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:28,636
Swipe it. God, girl.

358
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:33,728
- You're doing it again, Zelda.
- Oh. Give it a rest, Yolanda!

359
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:03,432
- Hey, Zelda, you want to smoke?
- That shit's ain't good for you, Duane.

360
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:04,675
Yeah. But it feel good.

361
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:07,008
- It does, doesn't it?

362
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,807
C'mon Elisa, just one.

363
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,561
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon

364
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:13,057
Don't worry about that camera.

365
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:14,732
We push them off on break time.

366
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:16,781
Uh-mm

367
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:18,438
This here's a blind spot.

368
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,994
I may have to finish some things in here,
fetch the General, will ya?

369
00:40:05,104 --> 00:40:06,369
Oh. You miss me, huh?

370
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,375
I took a candy break.

371
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,813
This is what scares you, huh?

372
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:17,725
Jeez, be used to it by now.

373
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:23,716
There you go again.
Making that god-awful sound.

374
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,389
Is that you crying, huh?
Is that what it is?

375
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:28,461
Are you hurting? Huh?

376
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,439
Or maybe you're angry?

377
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,136
Maybe you'd like to get another bite at me.

378
00:40:34,328 --> 00:40:35,311
Huh? Go ahead.

379
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:40,456
I can't tell.

380
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,528
Are you begging?

381
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:48,224
'Cause to me it's just the
worst fucking noise I've ever heard.

382
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:20,923
Elisa?

383
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:22,908
Elisa!

384
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,365
General Hoyt!
Welcome, Sir!

385
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:38,468
Everything's ready.
Glad to have you here, Sir!

386
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:40,329
- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.

387
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,638
Good God Almighty, Is that it?

388
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,751
A lot bigger than I thought.

389
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:45,987
Ugly as sin.

390
00:41:46,305 --> 00:41:49,741
You know, the natives in
the Amazon worshipped it as a God.

391
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,265
It doesn't look like much
of a God now, does it?

392
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:55,647
Well, they were primitive, Sir.
You know they tossed offerings

393
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:58,114
into the water, flowers, fruits,
crap like that.

394
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:01,435
Then they tried to stop the oil drill
with bows and arrows.

395
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,847
That didn't turn out too well.

396
00:42:03,302 --> 00:42:04,292
He's bleeding.
What happened?

397
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:06,848
What happened?

398
00:42:07,018 --> 00:42:09,046
- It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.

399
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:12,510
“Oxygen osmosis and dioxide exchange.”

400
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,616
What the hell we got here, Son?
- This creature, Sir

401
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:19,092
It can alternate between two entirely
separate breathing mechanisms.

402
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:21,319
- Mudskipper can do that.
- No.

403
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:24,570
Look. You want to put a man in space.

404
00:42:24,832 --> 00:42:28,062
He's gonna have to endure conditions
the human body just wasn't made for.

405
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,516
This gives us an edge against the Soviets.

406
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:33,463
How long can it breathe outside the water?

407
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,578
Reality, is, Sir.
We don't know jackshit about this thing.

408
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:41,494
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

409
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:43,168
Those cockeyed bastards.

410
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:47,229
You know, they let them send a dog up
in the space and we get a good laugh.

411
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:49,671
Then next thing you know,
they send a human up.

412
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:53,120
A Ruskie, orbiting our planet,
doing God knows what?

413
00:42:54,023 --> 00:42:55,678
Who's laughing now?
Krushchev.

414
00:42:56,064 --> 00:43:00,984
That's it. We let him put a dog in space,
he laughs, puts a commie in space

415
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,627
he laughs, puts missiles in Cuba.

416
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:05,543
Have we learned nothing?

417
00:43:05,688 --> 00:43:07,545
Sir. We need to get him back in the water

418
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:11,556
See this Scientist, they are like artists.
They fall in love with their playthings.

419
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,114
Now, right here-you see?
Along the middle?

420
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,184
This creature has a thick jointed cartilage
separating the primary and secondary lungs.

421
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:20,942
Am I explaining this correctly, Bob?

422
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:24,187
- Yes, but we have to...
- It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

423
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:27,858
- In principle, Sir, yes but...
- If we want to get the edge on the Soviets

424
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:30,470
we need to vivisect this thing.
- No, no, no.

425
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:32,141
Take it apart. Learn how it works.
- No.

426
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,250
- No. That would defeat the purpose

427
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:37,156
Sir? He's passed out.
Please.

428
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:40,599
Put him in the tank.
Let him pressurize.

429
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:42,780
General Hoyt, sir!

430
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,988
You cannot, under any circumstance,
kill this creature.

431
00:43:52,854 --> 00:43:56,155
Count these with me, Son.
There's five of them.

432
00:43:56,786 --> 00:43:58,910
That means I can do
whatever the hell I want.

433
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:01,069
You wanna plead your case?
I'll listen to it.

434
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,923
But, end of the day,
it is my damn decision.

435
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:52,254
Then cut and open that thing.

436
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,302
We need clarity in this case.

437
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,743
And give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.

438
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,696
You've done it.
- Thank you sir.

439
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,340
Now hurry up and finish
this job, son.

440
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:02,822
Absolutely, sir.

441
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:07,889
Get him out?
What are you talking?

442
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,595
No! Absolutely not!

443
00:45:11,638 --> 00:45:13,587
Because it's breaking the law!
And that's what.

444
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,962
We're probably breaking the law,
just talking about it.

445
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,615
Oh, he's alone.
Oh.

446
00:45:20,654 --> 00:45:23,495
This mean that...
whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant

447
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,202
you want to save every fish in the tank?

448
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:29,503
So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.

449
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,178
“It's the loneliest thing you've ever seen”

450
00:45:33,203 --> 00:45:34,884
Well you just said it, right?
You just said it.

451
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:36,988
You called it a thing. It's a thing.
It's a freak.

452
00:45:38,663 --> 00:45:39,791
I can understand you.

453
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,477
- Calm down!
God, calm down!

454
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:47,966
Alright. I will...
I will repeat it to you.

455
00:45:53,976 --> 00:45:54,835
"What I am?

456
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:02,880
I move my mouth, like him.

457
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,136
I make no sound, like him.

458
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:11,427
What does that make me?

459
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:18,023
All that I am,
all that I've ever been

460
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:21,482
Brought me here to him.

461
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,666
You see, you're saying "him".
It's a "him" now.

462
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:24,349
It's a...

463
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:25,462
Ow.

464
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:27,219
You just hit me!

465
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:28,931
Elisa, let go of me.

466
00:46:29,218 --> 00:46:32,163
I'm looking, I'm looking.
You've never... hit me!

467
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:41,061
When he looks at me,
the way he looks at me.

468
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:45,932
He does not know what I lack.

469
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:51,928
Or how I am incomplete.

470
00:46:54,069 --> 00:47:00,061
He sees me for what I am,
as I am.

471
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:07,019
He's happy to see me

472
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,799
Every time, every day.

473
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:17,910
And now I can either save him...

474
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,841
...or let him die.

475
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:32,734
I'm leaving. I have to... no
I have to leave.

476
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:36,070
Just Elisa, please stop!
Listen to me. Just listen to me.

477
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:39,583
I have to go! I'm leaving
now because this...

478
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:42,701
Elisa, this is very important to me.
This is a second chance for me!

479
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,440
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

480
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,843
And when I come back.
We will not talk about this, ever again.

481
00:47:49,522 --> 00:47:51,641
Elisa... there's...
Alright. Alright.

482
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:57,179
What are we? What are you and I?
What we are? We are nothing!

483
00:47:57,527 --> 00:47:58,659
Nothing. We can't do nothing!

484
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:00,445
I'm sorry.

485
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:02,651
But this-this-this is just...

486
00:48:03,077 --> 00:48:04,228
Oh god! He's not even human!

487
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,610
God.

488
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:11,181
What?

489
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:29,472
Giles!

490
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:36,603
- I've been waiting.
- I know, sorry.

491
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:37,175
It's okay.

492
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:40,143
We going in?

493
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,644
You should've just mailed the art.

494
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,842
No! I wanted to show you it
to you and the team and person

495
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,215
It's some of my best work.

496
00:48:49,022 --> 00:48:50,402
And this green as can be!

497
00:48:51,669 --> 00:48:52,351
It's uh...

498
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:55,613
It's not a good time.
Maybe later.

499
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:00,326
Oh well, sure, no problem.

500
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:05,516
What would be good time
for you, Bernie?

501
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:14,509
You painted that?

502
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:15,871
- Yeah.

503
00:49:16,643 --> 00:49:19,414
Wow!! You're good!

504
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,266
Apparently, not as good
as a photograph.

505
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:25,393
But it's good, isn't it, huh?

506
00:49:25,536 --> 00:49:27,504
Pfft. I couldn't
paint like that.

507
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:29,586
Here. On me.

508
00:49:30,377 --> 00:49:30,980
For me?

509
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:33,693
We don't get many like you in here.
You seem...

510
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:36,232
very educated.
I like talking to you.

511
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:38,871
The thing is...
That's the...

512
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,470
The only reason that I come in here is...

513
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:46,633
- The conversation. And the pie
is mighty fine too, isn't it?

514
00:49:46,658 --> 00:49:47,585
- Yeah. Yeah.

515
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:51,275
It's no key lime.
But it's good.

516
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,248
You know, I work alone.
And uh...

517
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,341
my best friend is not much
of a conversationalist.

518
00:50:01,992 --> 00:50:03,714
You see? That's part of
being on the job here.

519
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,265
It's like being a bartender.

520
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,349
You serve people pie, you listen
to their problems. Get to know them.

521
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:12,892
I'd like to get to know you better.

522
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:15,440
- What the hell are
you doing, old man?

523
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,445
Whoa. Oh-oh.

524
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:20,809
Hey! No-no-no. Not the counter.
Take out only. You can't sit there.

525
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:22,850
You want something,
you order, you take it out.

526
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:24,656
But it's empty...
The counter is-

527
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:26,966
All reserved. All day.
You don't sit down.

528
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,148
Y'all come back now, Y'hear?

529
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:35,991
You don't need to talk to them like that.

530
00:50:37,397 --> 00:50:38,428
You should go, too.

531
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,879
And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.

532
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,891
I have no one.

533
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:06,599
And you're the only person
that I can talk to.

534
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:07,933
Now.

535
00:51:08,862 --> 00:51:10,107
Whatever this thing is

536
00:51:11,406 --> 00:51:12,088
You need it.

537
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,326
So...

538
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,200
You just tell me what to do.

539
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:39,179
- "All those things..."
- "As the spring recedes..."

540
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:40,512
Let's go!

541
00:53:37,886 --> 00:53:40,175
Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

542
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:44,435
V8, 390 CID.
Clean and crisp like a fresh dollar bill

543
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,048
- I am just idling around.
- And I'm just talking.

544
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:51,176
AM radio, air conditioning,
power windows, power breaks,

545
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:52,880
power steering, power seats

546
00:53:53,538 --> 00:53:56,744
All deluxe interior appointment choices.
143 options.

547
00:53:56,982 --> 00:53:58,506
Now this is...

548
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:00,777
The Taj-Mahal on wheels.

549
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,443
- I'm not sure about the green.
- Oh, it's not green, my friend, Teal.

550
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:07,676
- Well, Teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see? It's a limited edition.

551
00:54:07,729 --> 00:54:11,721
Twelve coats of paint. Polished by hand.
All authentic chrome detailing.

552
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:15,116
Four out of five successful men
in America drive a Cadillac.

553
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:17,576
- Is that a fact?
- This here, is the future.

554
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:19,924
And you strike me as a man
who is headed there.

555
00:54:20,028 --> 00:54:21,599
- Where?
- Why? The Future.

556
00:54:21,953 --> 00:54:24,570
You are the man of the future.
You belong in this car.

Wow, Sir!
That is a beautiful car.

570
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:27,609
What can I say?
You gotta feel good drivin' that, eh uh?

571
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:30,865
And what a wonderful shade of green, huh?

572
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:33,192
- Teal.
- Teal.

573
00:56:14,043 --> 00:56:16,908
So at 5 a.m. I drive my car
down the loading ramp.

574
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:19,105
And the shifts are changing

575
00:56:19,425 --> 00:56:22,449
How much time do I have?
5 minutes? I'll remember.

576
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:24,861
5 a.m., 5 minutes.
Five-five. Five-five.

577
00:56:25,537 --> 00:56:27,250
You're going to move the cameras.

578
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:31,044
And uh. I'm gonna be synchronizing our watches,
just like they do in the movies.

579
00:56:31,749 --> 00:56:36,018
Oh God. I'm so proud of you.
God. You're just... You're not afraid.

580
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:42,828
You are? Very?
Don't tell me that! I'm terrified.

581
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:50,008
I think this is some of my best work.

582
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,470
Michael Parker. A good, trustworthy name.
A little butch.

583
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,271
Yes, age fifty-one?

584
00:56:56,939 --> 00:56:57,693
Fifty-four.

585
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:01,874
It don't have to be rude.

586
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,263
Fifty seven.

587
00:57:05,211 --> 00:57:06,972
I put the hair on,
I can pull it off.

588
00:57:07,107 --> 00:57:09,007
I can wear this. Or I have to uh...

589
00:57:11,817 --> 00:57:15,078
Or I have this. This
I think this one says “Working Man”.

590
00:57:15,134 --> 00:57:24,059
Now this. This says with butterscotch "tie“
it says casual but with stylish”.

591
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:28,675
So, you like this? I agree. I agree.
I think we're ready.

592
00:57:49,856 --> 00:57:50,832
Mr. Strickland!

593
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:54,277
Sally, could you call Mrs. Esposito
to clean up this spill?

594
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:02,948
You know, I can't figure it out myself.
You're not much to look at.

595
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:07,240
Go figure. I keep thinking about you.

596
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:10,681
When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent

597
00:58:10,826 --> 00:58:12,338
Or do you squawk a little?

598
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:16,362
Some of you squawk.
Not pretty.

599
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:21,891
I just want you to know.
I do not care about the scars.

600
00:58:24,232 --> 00:58:26,255
I don't mind those scars.

601
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,850
I don't mind that you can't speak, either.

602
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,570
When you come right down to it

603
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:33,594
I like it.

604
00:58:34,785 --> 00:58:35,928
A lot.

605
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:39,161
Kind of gets me going.

606
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,609
I bet I can make you squawk a little.

607
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:23,102
Hey, honey, are you okay?

608
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:26,102
You hurry up. I want to be home early.

609
00:59:27,072 --> 00:59:28,104
My feet are killin' me.

610
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:56,417
We need to delay the procedure.

611
00:59:57,937 --> 00:59:59,357
Knock before you enter my office.

612
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:00,692
This is urgent!

613
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,445
Go back out. Knock.
Then I'll let you in and we'll talk.

614
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,541
That's the protocol. Follow the protocol.

615
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:14,051
Come in.

616
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:16,124
Will you get the door for me, please?

617
01:00:22,073 --> 01:00:24,120
See? That is the way.
Now we talk.

618
01:00:24,346 --> 01:00:25,326
I need more time.

619
01:00:25,891 --> 01:00:28,391
Don't let the fact that
you feel like a loser now

620
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,897
that your competitive tendencies...
- I'm not competitive!

621
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:34,104
I don't want an intricate,
beautiful thing destroyed.

622
01:00:38,536 --> 01:00:42,895
This thing dies. You learn.
I leave. Out of here.

623
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:48,735
Settle down. My family settles down.
Somewhere. Nice. A real city.

624
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:59,013
This creature is intelligent.
Capable of language,

625
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,075
of understanding emotions.

626
01:01:03,507 --> 01:01:05,357
So are the Soviets, the Gooks

627
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,122
And we still kill them, don't we?

628
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:10,865
The bottom line is,
this is not a petting zoo.

629
01:01:11,112 --> 01:01:14,588
And I don't want to be in this shithole
any longer than I need.

630
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:15,778
Do you?

631
01:01:17,305 --> 01:01:19,805
Bob!
Do you?

632
01:01:22,322 --> 01:01:23,036
No, I don't.

633
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:46,896
Hey, what are you waiting for?

634
01:01:47,826 --> 01:01:50,929
- Have you seen Elisa?
- Come on, Zelda!

635
01:02:04,698 --> 01:02:06,793
Did you move the camera?
On the loading dock?

636
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:09,885
Is that where you are taking him?
Through the service tunnels?

637
01:02:10,379 --> 01:02:11,434
That's very smart.

638
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:13,942
Who do you work for?

639
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:36,658
Water must be kept at
5 to 8 percent salinity.

640
01:02:36,868 --> 01:02:37,946
Table salt will do.

641
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:41,661
Mixed one of these in this water.
Every three days.

642
01:02:43,453 --> 01:02:45,429
Raw protein diet is a must.

643
01:02:46,273 --> 01:02:49,471
In five minutes,
I'll meet you at the loading dock.

644
01:02:49,742 --> 01:02:52,042
The lights will go out,
so be prepared.

645
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:15,810
Mr. Strickland, Sir. 12 hours to
the vivisection of asset. And uh...

646
01:03:16,144 --> 01:03:17,985
I need your signature
here, please.

647
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:31,115
Hold it, right there.

648
01:03:53,116 --> 01:03:56,441
- Michael Parker. Is that you?
- My whole life.

649
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:15,232
Are you out of your mind?

650
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,789
Do not do this, Elisa!
Don't do this!

651
01:04:26,466 --> 01:04:31,426
- What's that? What's that vehicle?
- Laundry man?

652
01:04:32,542 --> 01:04:34,105
But it is not scheduled!

653
01:04:58,616 --> 01:05:00,417
- Sir!
- Meet me at the loading dock.

654
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:03,290
- Sir! What do you...
- Get back up.

655
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:10,225
Step out of the vehicle, Sir.
- Oh God, I'm not good at this.

656
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,569
Out of the vehicle. Now!
I will not say it again.

657
01:05:12,594 --> 01:05:15,268
- Please don't shoot me.
- Get out!

658
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,945
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!

659
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:30,755
Get out now!

660
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,065
We have to go! Hurry!

661
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:36,168
Oh! Woman we gon' burn in hell!

662
01:05:36,806 --> 01:05:38,972
Come on, push!
Push!

663
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:45,519
I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose!
Mechanical objects and I don't get along...

664
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:52,350
She's waiting for you at the dock!

665
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,613
Go! Now!
- Okay. Hold on.

666
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:10,708
Who's that man?
I think he just killed someone!

667
01:06:12,496 --> 01:06:14,877
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

668
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,360
Are we ready?
Are we ready?

669
01:06:38,048 --> 01:06:39,405
He's so beautiful!

670
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,623
Did I do that?

671
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,583
I'm just not good at this.

672
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:55,910
Move! Move!

673
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:46,273
No!

674
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:09,542
Salt?
What are you talking about, Salt?

675
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:13,193
Elisa!

676
01:09:22,906 --> 01:09:23,779
Israeli “Popper.”

677
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:27,687
Do you smell the magnesium?

678
01:09:29,495 --> 01:09:32,769
The Russians hate the Jews,
but they can't get enough of their gadgets

679
01:09:35,073 --> 01:09:36,033
How did they get in?

680
01:09:36,597 --> 01:09:39,255
Forged ID. Fake plates.
And so on and so forth...

681
01:09:39,402 --> 01:09:41,894
And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, Sir.

682
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,722
Well, no one has to know.
We got 24 hours before I bounce out.

683
01:09:46,003 --> 01:09:46,725
I called it in?

684
01:09:47,941 --> 01:09:48,814
Did you called it in?

685
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:51,063
The moment it happened, I...

686
01:09:51,406 --> 01:09:52,967
Mr. Strickland, Sir.

687
01:09:54,465 --> 01:09:55,259
What is it, Sally?

688
01:09:55,638 --> 01:09:57,814
- Sir, General Hoyt is on the phone.

689
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:00,810
That thing was our Space Dog, Strickland.

690
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:01,828
You know that.

691
01:10:01,882 --> 01:10:03,167
Sir, I'm gettin' it back.

692
01:10:04,217 --> 01:10:07,804
I don't-I can't be in a negative frame of mind, Sir.

693
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,144
So you're feeling good?

694
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,321
Feeling strong. Getting it back.

695
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:16,625
You can get it done. You're gonna get it done.
For me, Son. For me.

696
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,161
Is that when you're
planning on releasing him?

697
01:11:00,772 --> 01:11:01,878
On the tenth?

698
01:11:03,978 --> 01:11:05,414
So what if the rains are late?

699
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:07,065
What happens with the canal?

700
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:09,850
All right.

701
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:15,381
What's that?

702
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:17,561
Let me see it.

703
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:19,196
Is that for me?

704
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:01,218
That's good, keep it up.

705
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:04,295
Lookin' like you don't know anything.

706
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:08,241
Lord help me if they ask me if I do.

707
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:10,489
I am not a good liar.

708
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:11,919
Except for Brewster.

709
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:14,366
Takes a lot of lies to
keep a marriage going.

710
01:12:14,605 --> 01:12:15,628
<i>All personnel.</i>

711
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,144
<i>Prepare to present your
ID and entrance card.</i>

712
01:12:18,597 --> 01:12:19,771
<i>Security measures has been...</i>

713
01:12:20,082 --> 01:12:21,414
What in the...?

714
01:12:21,978 --> 01:12:23,937
<i>Attention.
All personnel.</i>

715
01:12:24,088 --> 01:12:26,406
<i>Prepare to present your ID
and entrance card</i>

716
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:29,396
You got us in trouble!

717
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:32,436
In my opinion, we are looking
at a highly trained group, Sir.

718
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:36,679
I'm thinking, conceivably, Sir.
Special Forces and so on and so forth.

719
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,225
Red Army Special forces?

720
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:39,205
- Conceivably.

721
01:12:40,033 --> 01:12:43,548
A highly-trained,
well-financed, elite group.

722
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:46,811
Highly efficient, ruthless,
clockwork precision.

723
01:12:46,936 --> 01:12:49,055
Infiltration took less than five minutes, Sir.

724
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,341
I can sure the estimate of
this Strict Force of at least 10 minutes.

725
01:13:08,012 --> 01:13:09,527
Have you always been alone?

726
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:16,015
Did you ever have someone?

727
01:13:17,912 --> 01:13:19,800
Do you know what happened to you?
Do you?

728
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,020
'Cause I don't.
I don't know what happen to me.

729
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,327
I don't know.

730
01:13:24,852 --> 01:13:28,418
I look in the mirror, the only thing
that I recognize are these eyes.

731
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:31,304
In this old man's face.

732
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:40,558
And sometimes I think I was either both
too early or too late for my life.

733
01:13:43,772 --> 01:13:45,805
Maybe we're both just relics.

734
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:02,919
Sir?
I got them.

735
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,022
Zelda, Elisa.
Come in.

736
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,878
Looks like you two, punched out
before the incident.

737
01:14:16,196 --> 01:14:16,838
So.

738
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:20,703
If you know something about
what transpired here.

739
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:24,290
It's your obligation to report any detail.

740
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,894
No matter how small
or trivial it may seem.

741
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,658
"Trivial" means "unimportant".

742
01:14:30,142 --> 01:14:33,245
I didn't seem nothin' out of the ordinary.
No.

743
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:36,693
Or trivial. See?
My feet were hurting...

744
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:37,842
What about you?

745
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:42,414
She didn't see anything.

746
01:14:52,358 --> 01:14:54,147
Hoffstetler. Dr. Hoffstetler.

747
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:56,970
Did either of you see him coming
in or out of the lab?

748
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,050
He works there, doesn't he?

749
01:14:59,154 --> 01:15:01,056
I mean in a different way.

750
01:15:01,318 --> 01:15:02,962
Doing something different.

751
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,482
Something trivial? No sir.

752
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:24,176
What am I doing?

753
01:15:24,406 --> 01:15:26,525
Interviewing the fucking help...

754
01:15:28,268 --> 01:15:29,851
The shit cleaners...

755
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:32,549
The piss wipers.

756
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:38,100
You two, go ahead. Leave.

757
01:15:49,532 --> 01:15:50,563
What did you say to me?

758
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:58,543
- What did she say?
- I didn't catch it.

759
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:04,822
- What is she saying?!
- She is saying "Thank you".

760
01:16:15,264 --> 01:16:16,002
Next.

761
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:58,377
<i>There's only one thing left to do.</i>

762
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:00,999
<i>"Volunteer".</i>

763
01:17:29,462 --> 01:17:31,538
No! No!

764
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:56,220
I want to get home early.

765
01:17:57,433 --> 01:18:00,319
Brewster has been in
a bad mood lately...

766
01:18:03,576 --> 01:18:04,591
Holy Jesus!

767
01:18:04,695 --> 01:18:07,004
What are you doing standing in the
shadows of the women's locker room??

768
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:09,108
They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here/

769
01:18:09,202 --> 01:18:10,194
For good reason.

770
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:12,097
What if you caught us in an inconvenient moment?

771
01:18:12,122 --> 01:18:14,947
- I need to know that he is alright.
- He is.

772
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,333
- When will you release him?
- Soon.

773
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:20,694
When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

774
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:24,647
If you need anything.

775
01:18:25,237 --> 01:18:26,813
Release him. Soon.

776
01:18:30,522 --> 01:18:31,768
What did she say?

777
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:34,644
She said, you're a good man,
Doctor Hoffstetler.

778
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,324
My name is Dimitri.

779
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:44,076
Honored to meet you.

780
01:18:46,537 --> 01:18:48,624
Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.

781
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:49,751
It's urgent.

782
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:59,154
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.
Believe me, I'm fine.

783
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:02,824
He ate Pandora,
it wasn't his fault.

784
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:04,334
He's a wild creature.

785
01:19:04,414 --> 01:19:06,362
We can't ask him to be anything else.

786
01:19:06,514 --> 01:19:09,506
Elisa, Go find him.
Go. Go!

787
01:19:10,357 --> 01:19:11,126
Go!

788
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:14,120
You're lucky.

789
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,303
I stayed awake as long as I could

790
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:24,121
But I'm not even a young man anymore.

791
01:20:24,742 --> 01:20:26,242
Is he alright? You sure?

792
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:31,848
Where are you going?
No, no.

793
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:35,759
Ok. No, no.
Don't play with the kitties.

794
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:38,356
Don't play with the kitties.

795
01:20:39,224 --> 01:20:40,523
I'm not angry.

796
01:20:55,157 --> 01:20:57,823
You did that. That's okay.
Ooh. I don't think that's sanitary.

797
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:03,343
Enough.

798
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,222
Interesting guy.

799
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:19,865
<i>All personnel.</i>

800
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,382
<i>Prepare to present your

801
01:21:22,746 --> 01:21:24,207
You wanted to see me?

802
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:30,248
How's it going? The investigation?

803
01:21:30,533 --> 01:21:32,947
- Well, we have a promising lead.

804
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:34,716
Really?

805
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,922
That's good to hear.

806
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:40,852
You joined us in Galveston.

807
01:21:40,965 --> 01:21:43,623
But where were you before, Hoffstetler?
- Doctor.

808
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,455
Excuse me?
- Doctor.

809
01:21:45,717 --> 01:21:46,655
Hoffstetler.

810
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:50,044
Protocol.

811
01:21:52,217 --> 01:21:54,788
- Wisconsin. Madison.
- That's right.

812
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:57,276
You gave up a tenure track position.
Didn't you?

813
01:21:58,177 --> 01:21:59,121
Gave it all up...

814
01:22:00,304 --> 01:22:01,082
For us.

815
01:22:04,014 --> 01:22:07,704
I suppose you're getting ready
to leave us now, then, huh?

816
01:22:09,027 --> 01:22:10,669
Only if the creature isn't found.

817
01:22:14,164 --> 01:22:16,401
What do you think?
You think we will find it?

818
01:22:16,881 --> 01:22:18,753
Well, you said you had a lead.

819
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:21,079
- I do.

820
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:12,981
Why you smiling, hon?

821
01:25:15,356 --> 01:25:16,419
Stop looking like that.

822
01:25:19,509 --> 01:25:20,270
What happened?

823
01:25:24,683 --> 01:25:25,294
Why?

824
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:27,908
How?

825
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:30,016
How?

826
01:25:31,657 --> 01:25:33,942
Does he?
Have a?

827
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:40,639
Mmm.

828
01:25:42,655 --> 01:25:43,337
Mmm.

829
01:25:53,604 --> 01:25:55,310
Never trust a man.

830
01:25:56,036 --> 01:25:58,107
Even when he looks flat down there.

831
01:28:03,823 --> 01:28:06,574
<i>I just signed up in anthropology.</i>

832
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:08,907
<i>We're gonna go have classes in
the Amazon Jungle...</i>

833
01:28:08,932 --> 01:28:10,559
<i>in South America.
- South America?</i>

834
01:28:10,584 --> 01:28:12,627
<i>Oh man. You have to get off
early in the morning</i>

835
01:28:12,652 --> 01:28:13,441
<i>That's a long hike.</i>

836
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,294
<i>- We're gonna stay down there.
- We are?</i>

837
01:28:16,369 --> 01:28:18,051
<i>Oh no. You're not coming along too.</i>

838
01:28:18,227 --> 01:28:21,631
This is a gelatin parfait.

839
01:28:22,461 --> 01:28:23,613
You will love it.

840
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:25,296
Dad, can we watch Bonanza?

841
01:28:25,462 --> 01:28:28,667
Bonanza is much too violent.
You know what I was thinking today?

842
01:28:28,692 --> 01:28:29,993
We get the kids a P-U-P-P...

843
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:24,227
What is going on?
I've got water pouring into my theater.

844
01:31:24,339 --> 01:31:26,719
I have four paying customers.
I can't afford a refund.

845
01:31:26,744 --> 01:31:28,148
It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.

846
01:31:28,173 --> 01:31:30,173
If you don't fix it. No more renting.
- I will fix it.

847
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:49,829
Elisa!

848
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:52,504
Dear God!

849
01:31:52,865 --> 01:31:53,587
Elisa!

850
01:32:23,636 --> 01:32:24,991
I'm toweling my hair.

851
01:32:26,532 --> 01:32:27,382
It's my hair!

852
01:32:28,746 --> 01:32:33,047
And... and... look at the arm.
The wound.

853
01:32:33,234 --> 01:32:35,170
As if it was never there.
Look at them.

854
01:32:36,564 --> 01:32:39,393
You said...
He was worshipped like a god.

855
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:41,687
Is he a God?
I don't look to him as a God. He ate a cat

856
01:32:41,712 --> 01:32:43,577
So I-I don't know! I don't know!

857
01:32:44,557 --> 01:32:46,263
We have to keep him around, awhile

858
01:32:47,779 --> 01:32:48,692
A little while.

859
01:33:08,674 --> 01:33:09,169
Hello?

860
01:34:50,676 --> 01:34:51,880
Your water, Sir.

861
01:34:53,246 --> 01:34:55,675
- And, Sir, General Hoyt.
- Uh-mm. Uh-mm.

862
01:34:56,443 --> 01:34:59,101
Tell him I'm not in, tell him I will call
him back. Don't put him through.

863
01:34:59,786 --> 01:35:02,419
No, Sir.
He's in your office.

864
01:35:06,364 --> 01:35:08,784
At this point our only
concern is the asset.

865
01:35:09,176 --> 01:35:09,919
Do you have it?

866
01:35:10,186 --> 01:35:11,781
Still in the wind, sir.

867
01:35:12,822 --> 01:35:13,956
That won't do.

868
01:35:14,976 --> 01:35:16,340
Yes sir.
I know.

869
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,455
You've know me for how long, Sir?

870
01:35:21,046 --> 01:35:24,578
- Thirteen years. Battle of Pusan.
- Yes, sir.

871
01:35:25,064 --> 01:35:28,667
A man is faithful, loyal, efficient
all of his life. All of it

872
01:35:28,794 --> 01:35:31,398
And he is... useful.

873
01:35:31,605 --> 01:35:34,224
And he expects...

874
01:35:35,926 --> 01:35:38,433
He has certain
expectations in return.

875
01:35:40,424 --> 01:35:41,781
And then...
He fails.

876
01:35:41,806 --> 01:35:43,773
Once. Only once.

877
01:35:44,154 --> 01:35:44,948
What does that make?

878
01:35:45,835 --> 01:35:47,065
Does that make him a failure?

879
01:35:51,343 --> 01:35:54,811
When is a man done, Sir?
Proving himself?

880
01:35:55,515 --> 01:35:56,871
A good man.

881
01:35:57,801 --> 01:35:59,292
A decent man.

882
01:36:03,195 --> 01:36:04,092
Decent?

883
01:36:09,643 --> 01:36:12,754
A man must have the decency
not to fuck up.

884
01:36:13,411 --> 01:36:14,425
That's one thing.

885
01:36:14,949 --> 01:36:16,117
That is real decent of him.

886
01:36:17,374 --> 01:36:21,254
The other kind of decency.
It doesn't really matter.

887
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:24,403
We sell it.
But it's an export.

888
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:26,735
We sell it 'cause we don't use it.

889
01:36:28,082 --> 01:36:33,446
36 hours from now,
this entire episode will be over.

890
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:36,702
And so will you.

891
01:36:38,387 --> 01:36:42,514
Our universe will have a hole in it
with your outline.

892
01:36:43,509 --> 01:36:47,884
And you will have moved on
to an alternate universe.

893
01:36:49,663 --> 01:36:51,083
A universe of shit.

894
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:55,702
You will be lost to civilization.

895
01:36:58,477 --> 01:37:00,749
And you will be unborn.

896
01:37:02,437 --> 01:37:03,278
Unmade.

897
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:06,804
Undone.

898
01:37:13,871 --> 01:37:16,293
So, go get some real decency, Son.

899
01:37:17,777 --> 01:37:19,316
And unfuck this mess.

900
01:37:55,247 --> 01:37:56,301
Thirty-six hours.

901
01:37:57,398 --> 01:37:58,273
Thirty-six hours.

902
01:37:59,148 --> 01:38:00,204
Deliver. You deliver.

903
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:02,078
That's what you do.
You deliver, right?

904
01:38:02,379 --> 01:38:03,380
Right?!

905
01:39:17,205 --> 01:39:18,617
You'll...

906
01:39:19,427 --> 01:39:20,324
never...

907
01:39:20,474 --> 01:39:21,506
know...

908
01:39:23,003 --> 01:39:25,995
Just how much...

909
01:39:28,019 --> 01:39:29,146
I've...

910
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,877
loved...

911
01:39:31,337 --> 01:39:32,496

Elisa.

927
01:41:23,145 --> 01:41:24,478
What is it, my honey?

928
01:41:51,453 --> 01:41:52,889
This isn't good.

929
01:41:55,834 --> 01:41:57,786
I'm going to call Dr. Hoffstetler

930
01:41:59,845 --> 01:42:01,540
You got to release him tonight, honey.

931
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,631
I'll come back and help you.

932
01:42:28,297 --> 01:42:29,459
He's coming out.

933
01:42:37,275 --> 01:42:38,088
Ugh.

934
01:42:42,317 --> 01:42:43,852
Sir, If you don't mind me saying.

935
01:42:44,371 --> 01:42:45,561
You don't look so well.

936
01:42:46,503 --> 01:42:47,145
Shut up.

937
01:42:49,981 --> 01:42:51,393
Can you smell that?

938
01:42:52,216 --> 01:42:55,549
I think it's your fingers.
They are black.

939
01:43:01,126 --> 01:43:04,508
There he is, Doctor fucking shitbird.

940
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,570
There's no call for cursing, Sir.

941
01:43:11,064 --> 01:43:13,077
Get out of the car.
I'm taking it.

942
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:16,684
- This is my car.
- Get the fuck out.

943
01:43:16,962 --> 01:43:20,352
- Out of my car?
- Did I stutter?

944
01:44:53,741 --> 01:44:58,828
- Strickland, thank God!
- You were speaking Russian, Bob.

945
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,474
- What's your name?
- Hoffstetler.

946
01:45:12,499 --> 01:45:16,649
Oh no. Don't lie.
You don't need to.

947
01:45:16,903 --> 01:45:18,688
You took a bullet to your gut.

948
01:45:18,881 --> 01:45:20,106
You're dead.

949
01:45:20,567 --> 01:45:23,947
I need the names, ranks and locations
of the entire Strike Team.

950
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:26,156
- Strike Team?

951
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:28,487
The ones that took the asset.

952
01:45:37,983 --> 01:45:42,760
This candy. It's cheap candy.
I love it ever since I was a kid.

953
01:45:43,926 --> 01:45:46,839
Some folks favor more sophisticated snacks

954
01:45:46,934 --> 01:45:50,324
Nougat center and all that fu-fu shit.

955
01:45:51,126 --> 01:45:52,213
But not me, Bob.

956
01:45:53,435 --> 01:45:54,689
This is it for me.

957
01:45:57,609 --> 01:45:59,783
Now. Sometimes, if I'm feeling anxious

958
01:46:00,211 --> 01:46:01,306
I just bite right into it

959
01:46:01,992 --> 01:46:05,127
But mostly, I take my time.

960
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:07,387
I make it last.

961
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:16,536
Names, ranks and location
of the strike team.

962
01:46:20,127 --> 01:46:22,285
Names! Ranks! Now!

963
01:46:26,988 --> 01:46:28,241
No names

964
01:46:29,845 --> 01:46:30,956
No ranks

965
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:32,987
They...

966
01:46:34,385 --> 01:46:35,654
They just clean.

967
01:46:47,381 --> 01:46:49,261
Alright Brewster. I'm gonna fix you dinner

968
01:46:49,286 --> 01:46:51,889
and then I'm going to run out
for a little while and help a friend.

969
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:55,932
- Help with what?
- Helping a friend.

970
01:46:58,481 --> 01:46:59,687
Zelda.

971
01:47:00,362 --> 01:47:01,251
Door.

972
01:47:05,315 --> 01:47:07,632
Well, You could well help me
answer the door, Brewster!

973
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:10,184
You're sittin' right there
just ten feet away from it.

974
01:47:10,209 --> 01:47:11,836
My back is acting up, woman.
You move.

975
01:47:11,861 --> 01:47:13,767
Your back. Your back. Always your back.

976
01:47:17,364 --> 01:47:18,441
Mr. Strickland!

977
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:20,643
What are you doing here?

978
01:47:21,132 --> 01:47:23,505
- Who's that man, Zelda?
- Where is it?

979
01:47:23,829 --> 01:47:25,019
- What are you talking about?
- Where did you take it?

980
01:47:25,465 --> 01:47:26,156
Zelda.

981
01:47:29,632 --> 01:47:32,990
The thing in the lab.

982
01:47:34,052 --> 01:47:34,997
Where is it?

983
01:47:35,036 --> 01:47:36,901
- Where is what?
- Sit down!

984
01:47:46,273 --> 01:47:47,638
I'm sorry, Sir.

985
01:47:48,031 --> 01:47:50,015
If I knew anything I would surely tell you.

986
01:47:54,448 --> 01:47:56,219
That story about Samson.

987
01:47:57,591 --> 01:47:59,446
I never told you how it ended.

988
01:47:59,905 --> 01:48:04,325
After the Philistines torture him
and blind him.

989
01:48:05,727 --> 01:48:08,782
Samson asks God for the strength he needs

990
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:12,867
And at the last minute, he is spared.

991
01:48:13,645 --> 01:48:14,962
And the Lord...

992
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:17,679
Gives him his strength back.

993
01:48:18,568 --> 01:48:19,685
One last time.

994
01:48:22,342 --> 01:48:28,637
And he holds the columns of the temple

995
01:48:29,171 --> 01:48:33,941
with his powerful arms and crushes them

996
01:48:45,174 --> 01:48:48,570
And he brings the whole building
down on the Philistines.

997
01:48:54,469 --> 01:48:59,970
He dies. But he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

998
01:49:00,776 --> 01:49:02,230
That is his will.

999
01:49:06,261 --> 01:49:07,332
Now.

1000
01:49:07,602 --> 01:49:10,785
Do you know what that
particular story means?

1001
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:13,324
For us, Delilah?

1002
01:49:14,438 --> 01:49:16,803
It means that if you know something
you're not telling me,

1003
01:49:16,828 --> 01:49:18,026
you're gonna tell me.
Either.

1004
01:49:18,717 --> 01:49:22,248
Either before or after...

1005
01:49:22,955 --> 01:49:25,534
I bring this particular temple...

1006
01:49:26,621 --> 01:49:29,303
down upon our heads.

1007
01:49:30,578 --> 01:49:32,309
Gal stole that thing
right out the lab!

1008
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,697
Whatever it is.

1009
01:49:34,179 --> 01:49:35,968
You go took it.

1010
01:49:36,318 --> 01:49:37,275
I heard my wife.

1011
01:49:37,817 --> 01:49:39,420
Talking on the phone about it.

1012
01:49:44,106 --> 01:49:47,598
Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller
for your assistance.

1013
01:49:58,902 --> 01:50:01,568
- What have you done?
- Zelda!

1014
01:50:02,034 --> 01:50:04,528
I got to warn her.
He's going after her

1015
01:50:04,643 --> 01:50:06,208
You will do no such thing, Woman.

1016
01:50:07,034 --> 01:50:09,533
Why you worry about her?
She broke the laws

1017
01:50:09,739 --> 01:50:11,651
Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!

1018
01:50:12,424 --> 01:50:13,852
For years, you don't talk

1019
01:50:15,612 --> 01:50:17,223
and now you can't shut your mouth.

1020
01:50:18,729 --> 01:50:19,863
Damn you Brewster!

1021
01:50:22,381 --> 01:50:23,500
You wouldn't understand.

1022
01:50:24,413 --> 01:50:27,452
You couldn't understand.
Not if you tried your whole life

1023
01:50:28,925 --> 01:50:30,560
- Hello?
- Giles, that you?

1024
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,544
- Yes.
- Put Elisa on the phone.

1025
01:50:33,282 --> 01:50:34,289
It's Zelda.

1026
01:50:36,248 --> 01:50:39,031
Elisa, honey, make a sound in
the phone if you can hear

1027
01:50:40,521 --> 01:50:41,436
Okay, good.

1028
01:50:42,179 --> 01:50:43,211
He's coming for you.

1029
01:50:43,572 --> 01:50:45,587
You got to go now and
you go to take that thing with you.

1030
01:50:45,978 --> 01:50:47,406
What?
Elisa!

1031
01:51:28,504 --> 01:51:29,417
Dammit.

1032
01:51:41,503 --> 01:51:42,423
We have to go!

1033
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:46,314
Where are you?

1034
01:51:47,132 --> 01:51:48,449
Where the fuck are you?!

1035
01:52:32,426 --> 01:52:33,568
That's nice.

1036
01:54:12,341 --> 01:54:13,694
I do not fail.

1037
01:54:15,922 --> 01:54:17,001
I deliver.

1038
01:54:22,205 --> 01:54:23,131
Elisa!

1039
01:54:24,653 --> 01:54:25,817
Elisa!

1040
01:54:35,066 --> 01:54:35,756
No.

1041
01:55:24,318 --> 01:55:25,229
Fuck.

1042
01:55:26,709 --> 01:55:28,634
You are a God.

1043
01:57:35,441 --> 01:57:36,591
If I told you about it

1044
01:57:37,274 --> 01:57:38,361
What would I say?

1045
01:57:39,443 --> 01:57:41,340
That they lived
happily ever after?

1046
01:57:42,384 --> 01:57:43,927
I believe it is.

1047
01:57:45,077 --> 01:57:46,028
That they were in love

1048
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:48,020
That they remained in love.

1049
01:57:48,859 --> 01:57:50,230
I'm sure that's true.

1050
01:57:51,774 --> 01:57:55,189
But when I think
of her, Elisa...

1051
01:57:56,964 --> 01:57:59,489
The only thing that comes to mind is a poem

1052
01:57:59,968 --> 01:58:03,832
Whispered by someone in love,
hundreds of years ago...

1053
01:58:04,855 --> 01:58:07,101
“Unable to perceive the shape of You"

1054
01:58:08,661 --> 01:58:10,614
"I find You all around me."

1055
01:58:11,535 --> 01:58:14,450
"Your presence fills my eyes with your love"

1056
01:58:15,793 --> 01:58:17,226
"It humbles my heart"

1057
01:58:18,198 --> 01:58:20,173
"For you are everywhere"

1058
01:58:34,052 --> 01:58:48,618
