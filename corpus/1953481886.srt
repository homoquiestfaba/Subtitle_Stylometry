1
00:00:01,188 --> 00:00:03,260
His Majesty, the King.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,444
<i>Previously..

3
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:08,132
It is settled.
We are to war with France.

4
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:10,357
Now,

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,327
I can go play.

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,201
- Sir Thomas More.
- Thomas.

7
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:16,405
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,106
You didn't say much
in counsel last night.

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,230
- About what?
- Going to war with France.

10
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:23,011
As a humanist, I have abhorrence of war.

11
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:26,000
As a king, I'm forced to disagree.

12
00:00:28,086 --> 00:00:31,817
- Now, there is someone I have to try.
- A hundred crowns you don't succeed.

13
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:33,138
Done.

14
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,608
I'm ranking you Duke.
Duke of Suffolk.

15
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:41,736
- How does that please Your Grace?
- Celebrate!

16
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:45,056
He has no right to any of this.

17
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,040
I'm a direct descendant of Edward II.
This is my crown!

18
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,235
Hold Your Grace. Your Grace's arrested
on suspicion of treason.

19
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:58,866
I have no heir.
The Tudor Dynasty.

20
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:02,759
All my father's work finished,
and it's my fault!

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,487
Henry, will you not visit my
bedchamber, as you used to?

22
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,546
Things are not well between us.
His Majesty and I.

23
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:14,138
I think sometimes
he'll ask me for a divorce.

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,675
A divorce? That's impossible.

25
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:18,413
Is it?

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,217
His Majesty is tiring of your sister.

27
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,021
When she was his mistress,
all our fortunes were made.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,526
They say that all his
liaisons are soon over.

29
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,727
He blows hot.
He blows cold.

30
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:32,387
Perhaps, you could imagine a
way to keep his interest more.

31
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,145
prolonged? to play his passions.

32
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,155
- Who are you?
- Anne Boleyn.

33
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:42,052
Mr. Wyatt, were you in
love with Anne Boleyn?

34
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,114
Of course I loved her, but
from a distance.

35
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:47,845
Never if you value your life, speak
of me to others, do you understand?

36
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,742
You must know that I desire
you with all my heart.

37
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:54,659
It is your duty to use
his love to our advantage.

38
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:58,135
No, not like this.
Seduce me.

39
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,804
I know what you're doing.

40
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:02,214
But do not think to take the King away.

41
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:04,462
When we're married,

42
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,965
I'll deliver you a son.

43
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,580
Everything within my power to give
you to you, it's yours, just ask.

44
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:13,987
I want a divorce,
and you will get one for me.

45
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:17,278
A divorce? I don't think that
English people would ever forgive him.

46
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:19,735
As far as I'm concerned,
our marriage has ended.

47
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:22,353
Soon he will see what you really are,

48
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:24,532
and he will tire of you.

49
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,664
And what if he does not?

50
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:29,770
If she gets her way,

51
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,339
she'll set our whole
country in her rule.

52
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:37,371
I have someone to
conclave of the cardinals,

53
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,685
to make a final judgment
on Your Majesty's annulment.

54
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,119
Make sure they come
to the right decision.

55
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:44,671
In this case, Eminence,

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,800
your reach has exceeded your grasp.

57
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,280
What if someone is
deliberately stalling?

58
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,690
Delaying things, making excuses.

59
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,544
You've gone cold on this divorce.

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,630
Perhaps, you've never
believed in the first place.

61
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,341
You lied to me, pretending
to be on my side.

62
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:00,709
Majesty!

63
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:03,536
If you are not for me now,
then you are against me.

64
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,070
Wolsey, sir, in the name of the King,

65
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,512
you're arrested by order of the King
and charged with high treason. / No!

66
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,134
You know, I don't wanna be chancellor.

67
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,266
You will do as I commend!

68
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,398
You think Mr. Cromwell is a great man?

69
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:18,044
No, I think he's a coming man.

70
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:22,285
As your Majesty well knows,
Kings are set above the law.

71
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,321
They're answerable to God
alone, who anointed them.

72
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:27,244
Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.

73
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,323
I shall denounce the Pope as a
heretic and marry whom I please.

74
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:33,386
If you want the world to know
that the King of England is

75
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,842
incapable of keeping his
word, then you have to.

76
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,239
I am merely Your Majesty's
humble servant.

77
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,835
I swear to you now,
everything will be different.

78
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,900
To hell!

79
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,513
I am the King of England!

80
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,248
If lion knows his own strength,

81
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:04,890
no man could control him.

Ambassador Chapuys.

00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,468
I thought you had abandoned us.

91
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,909
It's true. I did,

92
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,461
or tried to.

93
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,949
In our conscience, I could
never abandon Her Majesty.

94
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,274
She's the most gracious and
wonderful woman in the world,

95
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,826
and the sadest.

96
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:17,884
I agree with you.

97
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:19,605
So does the Emperor.

98
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,439
He has written this
letter of an encouragement

99
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:23,852
and support,

100
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,589
for your efforts on her behalf.

101
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,685
I beg you not to deliver it to me.

102
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:34,738
Already I given more than sufficient
prove of my loyalty to the king...

103
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:38,638
I must have nothing to provoke suspicions.
Consider the times we live in.

104
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:45,981
I don't want to be deprived of the liberty,
which will allow me to speak boldly in private.

105
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:48,986
about this matters which concern
your master and the queen.

106
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:52,647
I understand.
You need to say no more.

107
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,485
- Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.
- Your Majesty.

108
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,404
Sir Thomas More.

110
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:07,498
Sir Thomas.

111
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,351
Your Majesty.

112
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:11,020
I must tell you.

113
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:14,471
I've received a petition from the
members of the House of Commons

114
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:17,600
complaining of the cruel behavior
and abuses of the prelates

115
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:18,990
and the clergy.

116
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,770
Thomas..

117
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,987
people are asking for
freedom from clerical rule.

118
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,651
Your Majesty knows...

119
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,378
very well that I've always condamned the abuses of
the clergy. When they have been brought to light.

120
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:35,138
As your chancellor,

121
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:39,865
I have worked hard to eliminate
them and purify our Holy Church.

122
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,089
But..

123
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,193
You know where I stand.

124
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,368
You've always known.

125
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,824
I cannot condone this..

126
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:55,874
new fangled vision of private
belief and personal grace.

127
00:08:55,943 --> 00:09:01,051
For me, the church is the permanent
and living sign of God's presence.

128
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:05,535
It is a visible, palpable community.

129
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,421
Not just a few breather and
gathered secret rooms.

130
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,279
Then, you'll speak against me.

131
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:24,859
My loyalty and love for
Your Majesty is so great

132
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:27,570
that I'll never say a
word against you in public.

133
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,408
So, help me, God.

134
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:49,312
Arise for the King!

135
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:56,097
- Majesty.
- Majesty.

136
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:08,279
My Lord, Your Graces

137
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:10,678
We are come here among
you to hear your response

138
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,579
to the charges and
responsibilities laid against you.

139
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,897
You're generally charged with supporting
the authority of the late Cardinal Wolsey,

140
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,972
and the Bishop of Rome, against
that of your own king and country.

141
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:31,941
Some here among you may suppose
I seek personal advantage.

142
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,818
It is not so.

143
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:39,721
As your king, I'm commission to
restore right order on Earth.

144
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,204
and assert the immunities
and princely liberties.

145
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:46,287
of our realm and crown.

146
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:51,348
This is my sacred duty.

147
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:55,079
Seal before God,

148
00:10:56,424 --> 00:11:00,456
and by solemn oath at my coronation.

149
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:05,671
What is your conclusion,
Archbishop Warham?

150
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:08,289
Your Majesty,

151
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:13,851
before I deliver it, I give way to His Grace,
the Most Reverend Bishop Fisher,

152
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,891
The Bishop of Rochester.

153
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,694
My Lords,

154
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,935
we are asked to admit His Majesty

155
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:33,319
as Supreme Head of
the Church in England.

156
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:39,275
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee this
to the king without abandoning

157
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:42,264
our unity with the sea of Rome.

158
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:48,105
If we are to renounce the
unity of the Christian world,

159
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:51,071
and leap out of Peter's ship,

160
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:58,338
then we shall be drown in the waves of
all heresies, sex, schisms and divisions.

161
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,944
I'm saying to you

162
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:02,844
that the acceptance of

163
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:08,499
legal supremacy over our Holy Church
would represent a tearing a thunder,

164
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,300
of the seamless coat of Christ.

165
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:18,696
Your Grace!

166
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,643
We'll hear your judgment.

167
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,533
I'll put this proposal to Congregation

168
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:29,658
that Your Majesty has a new title.

169
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:34,687
supreme head of the Church
and clergy of England,

170
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,024
but I had the caveat.

171
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:39,948
as far,

172
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:43,030
as the law of Christ alone,

173
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:49,705
Who is in favor?

174
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:06,229
Very well.

175
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:10,169

00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,244
So, they're assumed to be agreed.

178
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,050
Thank you, Your Grace.

179
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:48,895
<i>Rome

180
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:11,479
- Cardinal Campeggio!
- Holy Father.

181
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:18,641
Sit down, Cardinal Campeggio.
I know you're hard to go.

182
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:23,577
And my feet are killing me too.

183
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,709
What'd you want to see me about?

184
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:30,251
We have received 2 new letters regarding
to King of England, the Great Matter.

185
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:33,681
Oh, not again.

186
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,211
What do they say?

187
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,992
Well, the first one's from the King himself, writing
cordial to make a final and favorable decision,

188
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:45,292
on his noun and for the
sake of peace in England.

189
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:49,487
He uses a salmon temperate
language of Holiness,

190
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:54,145
complaining that never there
was any prince handled by a Pope

191
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,370
"as Your Holiness has treated us."

192
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,820
He meant my predecessor and
frankly, he has the point.

193
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:03,717
Clemente was a terrible
procrastinator, indeed.

194
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,832
Although it was very wrong
for some people to dig up

195
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:11,711
the dead body and stabbed it in the street,
I can well understand that feelings.

196
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,234
He was never popular.

197
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:16,835
Requiescat in pace.
And the second letter?

198
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:20,125
From the Emperor on behalf of his aunt,

199
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:25,763
Catherine, the unhappy queen,
urging you to prevent interment,

200
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:30,276
and ex-communicate the King.

201
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:34,656
It is true, we must come to a judgment.

202
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:38,456
On the other hand,

203
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,164
to protect the interest of the Church,

204
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:45,674
we should try not to antagonize
one par above the other, after all,

205
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:51,481
they have soldiers and guns while as
we must make duel with beauty and truth.

206
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:56,006
What about this girl,
this putane, the King's whole?

207
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:57,354
Anne Boleyn.

208
00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:01,632
Yes, why doesn't someone
just get rid of her?

209
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:20,860
No.

210
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:23,057
Don't get up.

211
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:30,531
Stay like that.

212
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,438
You're so very beautiful,

213
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:40,775
so very desirable.

214
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,407
I have to possess you completely.

215
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,249
I can't wait.

216
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,548
Oh, my love.

217
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,977
Just a little longer,

218
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,294
and then..

219
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:10,950
I've made the head of
the Church of England.

220
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,051
Is it true?

221
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:22,444
Then I'm so.. glad.

222
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:26,407
At last, you'll have your right,

223
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,003
and can do as your will.

224
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:35,839
I'm glad to have Cromwell refurbish
some of the apartments in the Tower.

225
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:39,482
Every Queen of England stays there

226
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:42,541
before the coronation.

227
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:01,841
Papa.

228
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,857
What's wrong?

229
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,407
Don't you want to celebrate?

230
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:08,423
It's far too early for that.

231
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,903
The bishops are not really defeated.

232
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:15,654
By default, they voted to make
the King head of the Church,

233
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,805
but only as far,
as the law of Christ allows.

234
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:25,591
You don't have to be a clever lawyer to know that the
lord of Christ may be used to invalidate the vot itself.

235
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,956
Then it was all for nothing.

236
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:31,621
No,

237
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,124
not for nothing.

238
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:38,226
The principle has now been
effectively conceded by most of them.

239
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:39,866
As George told me,

240
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:43,874
there're resistance and recalcitrance
really stand from only one man.

241
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,463
- That bloody Bishop Fisher.
- Fisher.

242
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:56,266
- Sir?
- Ah, Mr. Cranmer!

243
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,054
I'm so sorry to be late, Mr. Cranmer.

244
00:18:58,216 --> 00:18:59,511
It's completely unforgivable.

245
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:02,412
Nonsense, we haven't even begun dining.
It's good to see you.

246
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:06,328
- Mr. Boleyn
- Mr. Wyatt, this is Mr. Cranmer.

247
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,684
Mr. Cranmer, you are a man
of the cloth, I believe.

248
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:14,902
- And are you not a poet, Mr. Wyatt?
- That's the least of my sense.

249
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,873
You may take one of my
confession after suffer.

250
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:18,674
I wouldn't if I were you.
It'll turn your head wired.

251
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:23,639
We were discussing before you arrived, the
progress of the Congregation of Bishops,

252
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:26,166
which was called to decide
upon the King's supremacy.

253
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:32,235
His majesty has wisely decided to appoint
George Boleyn here to negotiate with Their Graces.

254
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:34,161
I found most of them accommodating.

255
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,758
Of course, there're a
few stubborn exceptions.

256
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,839
- Bishop Fisher, I assume.
- True.

257
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,551
May I ask who else?

258
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,520
The archbishop himself.

259
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:45,980
Warren.

260
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,089
After years being perfectly pliable,

261
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,902
he suddenly become rather intransigent.

262
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:51,227
It's because he's old,

263
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:55,019
and consequently, he's closer to his maker,
to whom undue course he must explain himself?

264
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:57,386
Well, I'm sure that there'll be
a simple matter of him to explain

265
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,761
how he helped liberate his church from

266
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,673
superstition, religious false
of the ecclesiastical greed.

267
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,793
Mr. Rouss.

268
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:46,918
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:49,792
A cook

270
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,063
like trade.

271
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:55,053
Yes, sir.

272
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,897
You understand what we expect of you?

273
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:05,528
I do, yes.

274
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,792
This is for your trouble.

275
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:21,241
If you betray us,

276
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:26,363
I'll destroy your entire family.

277
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,338
Majesty, this is Mr. Cranmar,
whom I have often spoken.

278
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:26,014
to ask Mr. Cranmer who
first spoke the fact that

279
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:30,240
Your Majesty's great matter was
a theological issue and not legal one.

280
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,054
Mr. Cranmer.

281
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,543
I have desire to meet you almost
above any person now living.

282
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:41,648
You're most welcome here at court.

283
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,244
- Majesty, I..
- It's funny.

284
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:47,356
Some of the greatest and most
celebrated minds in my kingdom,

285
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:52,037
sweated and struggled over an issue which you,
an obcure caraf, if you forgive me,

286
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:56,881
was able to resolve with perfect
simplicity and a clarity of mind which..

287
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:59,059
put a mold of shame.

288
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,284
Majesty, I..

289
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,764
Um.. I..

290
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:08,515
Mr. Cranmer, His Majesty has decided
to appoint you his personal chaplain.

291
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,266
I.. ah..

292
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:18,109
You must thank His Majesty.

293
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:22,883
Majesty.

294
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,379
You are welcome here, Mr. Cranmer.

295
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:30,879
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty.

296
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:37,043
Well done, Mr. Cranmer, well done.

297
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,026
So you married your wad?

298
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:44,344
What's her name?

299
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,567
Catherine Brook.

300
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,764
Catherine...

301
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:48,956
Why her?

302
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:52,015
I love and admire Miss Brooke.

303
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,309
Reminds me of my mother.

304
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,279
How old is she?

305
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,153
Seventeen.

306
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,529
Some mother.

307
00:24:06,198 --> 00:24:07,612
Poor Catherine.

308
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:11,760
You're incapable of fidelity,
Charles, you always have them.

309
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,839
This time is different.

310
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,409
How different?

311
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,242
I don't know.

312
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,394
I just feel it.

313
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:27,009
And it is not because she's beautiful.

314
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:32,293
It is a marriage of two souls.

315
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,700
I'm sure you can understand that.

316
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:52,386
Oh, sun, go away.

317
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,988
Leave us to our own defiance.

318
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:07,389
I love you, Anne Boleyn.

319
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,290
I always will.

320
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:13,665
Always.

321
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,906
How could you say that, Thomas?

322
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:22,703
No unfortune brings what time changes.

323
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:32,344
Time won't change me,

324
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,618
or this.

325
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:04,361
Thomas.

326
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,516
My Lady Anne.

327
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:21,430
I'd like to congratulate
you for reaching so high.

328
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,492
Thank you, Thomas.

329
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,548
I sure never forget that
we were once true friends.

330
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:30,838
Oh, I wish I could forget.

331
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,580
But I see you are raised, too.

332
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:39,864
Well, it is a.. sometimes diplomat,
thanks to the patronage of Mr. Cromwell,

333
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:43,039
We person painters,sometimes
have our uses.

334
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:45,829
There is someone here
I sure you'd like to meet.

335
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:47,677
Lady Anne Boleyn, this is Mark Smithen,

336
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:51,878
dancing master, singer, musician,
and a general all round genius.

337
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,231
Mr. Smithen.

338
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:55,420
He likes to be called just plain Mark.

339
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,980
How could he possibly be called plain?

340
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,436
My lady, it's a great pleasure.

341
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,701
- You play the violin?
- Indeed.

342
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:08,648
Play me something.

343
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:10,479
Of course.

344
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:00,777
Will you share me?

345
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:13,300
I wanted to thank Your Grace
for your speech to congregation.

346
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:14,575
It was well said.

347
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:17,171
- and very brave.
- I spoke only truth.

348
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:21,504
I believe that the caveat,
so far is the law of Christ allows,

349
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,448
does indeed invalidated the whole bill.

350
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,573
How can the law of
Christ permit a lame on,

351
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:32,953
even a king, to be head of the Church?

352
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:35,920
Boy, a little for me.

353
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:58,817
I must ask you, Sir Thomas,

354
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,525
If you still have a mind
to resign your office..

355
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:06,859
After the vot, Your Grace,
I must confess I was solely tempted.

356
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:09,593
But on reflection,

357
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:12,629
I'm contempt to stand
fight for Christianity.

358
00:30:12,884 --> 00:30:15,202
Oh, this is excellent news.

359
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,443
As indeed, is the turning
again of the archibishop.

360
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:23,327
I thank God that his conscience
has finally driven him to condemn

361
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:25,111
the King's solely suit.

362
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:27,994
And he has stated his intention to...

363
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,242
oppose the legislation,

364
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:37,589
which might be injurious to the Church.

365
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,084
Get a doctor.

366
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:47,601
Call a doctor, quick!

367
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,243
Help! Please help!

368
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:53,511
Oh, god, god..

369
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:58,910
Four men died of that pains.

370
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,549
Bishop Fisher survived then
because he ate a little of the soup.

371
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:06,651
It's very unfortunate, Sir Thomas.

372
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:09,386
It's more than
unfortunate, Your Majesty.

373
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:14,229
Fisher's cook has been arrested,

374
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:16,987
but I must tell you that..

375
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:23,476
that rumors abound us to the identity
of those who part of against him.

376
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,252
Who?

377
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:28,500
Wilchare's been named.

378
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,910
- Boleyn?
- Yes.

379
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:32,775
And...

380
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:37,241
well, some people even blame the Lady Anne.

381
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:39,641
Also people would blame her for everything!

382
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:44,236
They'll blame her if there're rains,
or if the rains fell.

383
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:48,036
They'll blame her for the baroness of the
queen, and for the fact that I love her.

384
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:50,419
They'll blame her for the
wind that destroys our crops,

385
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,020
and the storms that sink our ships.

386
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:56,032
It's all the fault of the Lady Anne.

387
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:07,782
What about you, Sir Thomas?

388
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,659
Do you blame her?

389
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:13,390
Do you think she'd try
to poison Bishop Fisher?

390
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:16,565
- Henry..
- All the time for "Henry" is over!

391
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:22,127
Whoever was to blame..

392
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:25,001
the cook, Rouss, tried

393
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:29,215
blatantly and almost successfully,
to poison one of Your Majesty's

394
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:33,654
great public servers, the bishop
of our Holy Church, as well as me.

395
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:37,423
Now, if Your Majesty would
turn up blind eye to a few things.

396
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:41,154
everyone would be forced to assume
that the attempted murders were

397
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,654
done with your blessing.

398
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:06,300
My lord, Boleyn.

399
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:19,672
Mr. Rouss, we can go over
and over this all day, so

400
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:21,479
one more time,

401
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,526
who gave you poison?

402
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:35,893
Mr. Rouss, it is inconceivable that you should suddenly
take upon yourself to murder your master and his household.

403
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:40,089
after serving him so diligently
these past four years.

404
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:43,552
Who gave you poison?

405
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,866
Sir, I have three daughters.

406
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,927
What does that mean?

407
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:08,548
I want them to find good husbands,

408
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:11,469
but that takes money.

409
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:19,951
We can pay you for your information.

410
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,454
No, sir.

411
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:26,741
Payment is already paid.

412
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,731
You can't set on it.

413
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,745
You're a fool,

414
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,467
and you will die for it.

415
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,752
You, hold a moment.

416
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,416
Where're you taking this linen?

417
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:15,873
- To the Queen's Majesty.
- Why?

418
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:19,581
To make shirts for His Majesty.
She always does that.

419
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,037
She still makes his shirts?

420
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,424
Yes. Yes, Miss Anne.

421
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,671
- Sweetheart.
- How could you?

422
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,826
- What?
- Your shirts!

423
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:08,770
She still makes your shirts!
How could you let her?

424
00:36:09,048 --> 00:36:10,855
I haven't even thought about it.

425
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:16,719
You told me there was nothing
intimate between you anymore.

426
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,033
There isn't. What intimate.
They're just shirts for god's sake.

427
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:23,880
No, they're not just shirts.
They're you and me.

428
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:25,780
They're you and her!

429
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:29,048
- I don't understand.
- Then you want to.

430
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,610
It's so hard when we're to be
married, but she's still here!

431
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:39,917
You can't have three people in a marriage,
why can't you see that?

432
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:44,344
And why can't you understand that I have
more things to think about than my shirts!

433
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:56,191
The King has agreed to a new
and harsh treatment of prisoners.

434
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:59,338
They would be boiled alive.

435
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:04,135
He's wise to have dealt
so severe in this case.

436
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,261
But he cannot avoid some suspicions.

437
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:11,389
At least against the
lady and her father.

438
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:16,836
We're all in the hands of God.

439
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:24,136
But I worry about why
I lie here uselessly.

440
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,149
The King might proceed
with his divorce, since

441
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:31,185
he has given himself the power.

442
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:35,379
I was told that at the last counsel,
the King became angry.

443
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,023
and demanded to know what would
happen if he went ahead anyway

444
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:41,422
and marry to Anne without
Pope's permission?

445
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:47,106
- That.. what did they say?
- Only Boleyn supported him,

446
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,632
not even his friend, Brandon.

447
00:37:50,629 --> 00:37:52,274
Thank god.

448
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,161
Catherine!

449
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:03,862
Husband.

450
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,063
How are you feeling?

451
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:07,130
What?

452
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:11,069
They told me you've been suffering from
toothache which I know is a terrible pain

453
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,248
and someone even said
you have a touch of gout.

454
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:17,535
Of course, I don't have gout.
I don't know why you even listen to such stupid rumors.

455
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:19,853
Because I care for you.

456
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,060
Catherine.

457
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,597
You're gonna have to
stop making my shirts.

458
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:30,229
I thought you liked the
shirts I made for you.

459
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:32,170
I see where you're wearing one.

460
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:36,516
- Henry.
- What now?

461
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,475
Our daughter Mary has..
has been not well.

462
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:44,604
She has not kept any food
on for eight days now.

463
00:38:45,415 --> 00:38:47,709
Do you not think we should visit her?

464
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:50,351
You can go and visit
the princess if you like,

465
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,345
and you can stay there.

466
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:59,923
Even not for our daughter, not for anyone
would I dream of leaving you.

467
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:03,486
You know my rightful
place is by your side.

468
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,567
I can sign myself to God's mercy.

469
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:23,671
Bless you, sir.

470
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:27,261
Tell my girls I died easily,
and with no pain.

471
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:30,138
Head first?

472
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:32,479
Or wherever it comes?

473
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:06,407
Sit.

474
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:14,681
Your wife looks very beautiful,

475
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:17,021
seem very happy together.

476
00:41:17,485 --> 00:41:19,362
Yes, we are.

477
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:22,931
Happy marriage is devoutely
something to be wished for.

478
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:28,146
To open the bridge,
I want you to do something for me.

479
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,489
Your Grace.

480
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:00,915
I need to speak to Your Majesty alone.

481
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:13,406
The King has sent you? at this hour, why?

482
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:16,999
The King wants you to be sensible.

483
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:20,892
withdraw your appeal to Rome, and
entrust your face with his hands.

484
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:23,395
And he promises to be more generous.

485
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,981
As you know, the parliament
is about to make him supreme

486
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:29,228
in the matter spiritual,
as well as temporal.

487
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:30,195
No.

488
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,347
Only the Pope has God's
power here on earth,

489
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,734
and is the image of eternal truth.

490
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:38,956
- Yes, but the King..
- Your Grace,

491
00:42:40,115 --> 00:42:44,773
I love and have loved His Majesty
as much as any woman can love a man.

492
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:48,295
But I would not have wanted him
company as his wife, one moment

493
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,451
against the voice of my conscience.

494
00:42:51,424 --> 00:42:54,391
I am his true wife.

495
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,743
Go to Rome if you want, and argue
it there with lots of important men,

496
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:04,704
instead of here,
it's just one poor woman.

497
00:43:37,674 --> 00:43:39,157
What did she say?

498
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:41,823
She said that she'll obey
Your Majesty in everything.

499
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:45,160
Serve her obedience
to two higher powers.

500
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,170
Which two higher powers?

501
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,775
The Pope and the Emperor?

502
00:43:48,775 --> 00:43:49,656
No.

503
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:52,854
God and her conscience.

504
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:05,180
Chapuys.

505
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:07,567
Majesty.

506
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:10,229
You can tell your master.
Actually, you can tell anyone you like.

507
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:12,803
I'll never agree to be judged
by the Pope in this matter,

508
00:44:12,803 --> 00:44:15,515
and I don't care if Figavus
tries to excommunicate me.

509
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,734
He can do what he likes in Rome,
I'll do what I like here.

510
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:20,194
Majesty.

511
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,234
And by the way,

512
00:44:22,674 --> 00:44:24,505
welcome back to court.

513
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,405
Majesty.

514
00:44:57,101 --> 00:44:58,885
How was the Queen?

515
00:44:59,882 --> 00:45:01,504
She was beautiful.

516
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,050
She's like a thing of the
other world once I got you.

517
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:32,304
I remember you once told me that..

518
00:45:32,884 --> 00:45:35,711
you might sometimes
have to make me feel sad,

519
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:38,718
even if you didn't mean to.

520
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:43,261
Are you really going to make me sad?

521
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:47,131
No.

522
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:50,515
I swear to all that is holy.

523
00:45:50,746 --> 00:45:52,647
All things will be in good.

524
00:45:53,265 --> 00:45:57,298
And to you, I'll always be true,

525
00:45:58,456 --> 00:45:59,940
never changing.

526
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:10,369
I wouldn't blame you
if you don't believe me.

527
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,444
Do you believe me?

528
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,896
Majesty.

529
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,816
- You're sent for me?
- Anne.

530
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:46,408
How should you like
to go hunting tomorrow?

531
00:46:50,626 --> 00:46:53,662
If that is what Your Majesty desires.

532
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:55,469
We may be away for a while,

533
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,578
visit people,

534
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:00,174
stay with em.

535
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:04,234
Majesty, what is this all about?

536
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:06,049
And when we return,

537
00:47:06,663 --> 00:47:08,054
we shall be alone.

538
00:47:08,981 --> 00:47:10,139
Alone?

539
00:47:10,649 --> 00:47:11,947
You and I,

540
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,245
here,

541
00:47:15,053 --> 00:47:16,860
No other person.

542
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,141
Do you mean it?

543
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:26,385
I've already given instructions
for Catherine to leave.

544
00:47:29,676 --> 00:47:30,696
Oh, my god.

545
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:37,893
Are you the most happyer?

546
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:15,056
Husband, what is this?

547
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,383
- I saw it.
- What?

548
00:48:22,055 --> 00:48:24,071
- What did you see?
- After a long time...

549
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:30,885
I knew Lutheran tend
to haul a false prophet.

550
00:48:31,418 --> 00:48:33,782
And so many signs..

551
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:37,141
I still don't understand.

552
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:39,222
What is it you've seen?

553
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:44,860
The Beast. The Antichrist.

554
00:48:45,694 --> 00:48:48,197
He's near at hand, Alice.

555
00:49:02,228 --> 00:49:04,669
- You remember to pet him to drive?
- Yes, Madam.

556
00:49:04,919 --> 00:49:06,632
Beautiful morning for a ride.

557
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:09,129
Beautiful.

558
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:17,959
Be very careful with it, John,
on your own.

559
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,388
Let's go.

560
00:49:30,438 --> 00:49:31,357
Move on.

561
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:11,967
My Lady, Mr. Secretary Cromwell
is here to see you.

562
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:15,420
Madam.

563
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,144
His Majesty commands that he'll be
gone from this place within a month

564
00:50:31,145 --> 00:50:33,445
and settle at his house in More.

565
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:41,029
He did not even say good-bye.

566
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:51,875
You are free, of course, to take
with your attendance and servants.

567
00:50:55,236 --> 00:50:56,974
Wherever I go,

568
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:59,848
I remain his wife,

569
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:02,096
and I'll pray for him.

570
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:11,288
There's ah.. another matter.

571
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:16,047
His Majesty wishes that you return to him
the official jewels of Queen of England.

572
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,314
No!

573
00:51:27,241 --> 00:51:29,744
I'll not give up
with these rightfully mine

574
00:51:30,022 --> 00:51:33,081
to adorn a woman who was
the scandal of Christianity.

575
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:22,645
Bless Your Majesty.

576
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:25,865
Your Majesty.

577
00:52:25,865 --> 00:52:28,386
Your Majesty.

578
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,067
God bless Your Majesty.
God bless you.

579
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:31,839
Thank you.

580
00:52:31,978 --> 00:52:34,643
- God bless Your Majesty!
- Thank all of you.

581
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:51,067
Blessing Lady.

582
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:53,431
Queen of Hearts.

583
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:57,533
There will be even crazier
crowds than this to welcome you..

584
00:52:57,973 --> 00:53:00,175
when you return to London.

585
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,221
Yes? Come.

586
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,448
Well?

587
00:53:56,911 --> 00:54:01,917
Majesty, I'm asked to pass on a
message of farewell from the Queen.

588
00:54:02,056 --> 00:54:05,579
She regrets that you did
not wish her goodbye,

589
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,473
and she inquires after
Your Majesty's health.

590
00:54:24,268 --> 00:54:26,058
The Queen! I do not
want any her goodbyes,

591
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:30,143
and I'm not wish to
offer her consolation!

592
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,689
I do not care whether she
ask after my health or not.

593
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:35,205
Let her stop this, and
mind our own business!

594
00:54:35,324 --> 00:54:37,872
- Do you understand me!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

595
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:39,240
Get out!

596
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:56,158
I'm sorry.

597
00:54:56,807 --> 00:54:58,707
Don't apologize.

598
00:55:11,036 --> 00:55:13,191
How could things be different?

599
00:55:16,204 --> 00:55:18,174
Indeed, everything is beautiful.

600
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:23,481
Don't you think?

601
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:27,004
Everything is beautiful?

602
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:33,470
Yes.

603
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:37,595
Everything is beautiful.

604
00:55:54,564 --> 00:55:56,186
She's a witch,

605
00:55:56,696 --> 00:55:59,987
who deserves all the fate
and to be dispatched to hell.

606
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,579
And who will you assassinate?
The Lady Anne?

607
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:08,052
Be the closer servant to the King.
I'm in a position to do so.

608
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:11,576
She seduced and bewitched him.

609
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:15,184
Consider his betraying his
lawful wife and the Holy Church.

610
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,500
We must not stay any longer,

611
00:56:19,732 --> 00:56:22,212
but our prayers and hopes go with you.

612
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:29,212
