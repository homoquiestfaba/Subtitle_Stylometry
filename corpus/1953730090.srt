before dinner.

the markets tumbling.

94
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,119
You don't know that.

95
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,599
Well. it could be.

96
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,599
But even if they drop.
It'll only be temporary.

97
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,679

they'll be twice as strong.

104
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,879

there'll be a hell of a fight.

who helped draft this speech. Bobby?

107
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,599
I guess you're a little more daring

108
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,279
when you're 14 points behind
on the campaign trail

109
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,442
and half a bottle of Scotch
under your belt.

110
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,079
I just found out the story's
been leaked to the 'Herald'.

111
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,639
And with that much lead time.

112
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,599

your opponents will massacre you

to delay this speech?

117
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,439

121
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,999

The damage is done.

123

Well. like you said. sir.
we do have two hours.

124
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,959
That's not enough time.

125
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,611
It is for me. unless you'd rather
keep me here arguing about it.

126
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,919
Your boy is a confident
little prick. isn't he?

127
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,279

128

submitting to the Pentagon on Monday.

175
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,439
It happens to be in your district -
another coincidence. I suppose.

176
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,639
Yeah, 30,000 jobs is a career-buster
if I ever saw one.

177
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,326
You can't intimidate me. Mr Bishop.

178
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,161
Well. it's your choice. Congressman.

179
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,119
By the way. uh...

180
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,479
Are you still doinking
your legislative director

181
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,279
at the Crystal City Marriott?

182
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,359
Room 327. I think it was?

183
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,842
Yeah. I'd hate to have that leak out
on Monday as well.

184
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,604
Hey. Mike.
MAN: Mr Bishop.

185
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,490
Next question.

186
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,159
REPORTER: Mr Bishop.
we've been hearing rumours

187
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,159
that the President is planning
radical change for his second term.

188
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,639
You've been hearing rumours.
have you?

189
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,119
The President will present his agenda

190
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,719
for the next four years
when he's ready

191
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,439
and I can guarantee
it will be rational, not radical.

192
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,441
Next question.

193
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,730
Excuse me! Excuse me.

194
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,839
The Herald' has it
from a very reliable source

195
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,079
that part of the President's plan
is a freeze on all government contracts.

196
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,559
Excuse me. miss.

197
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,007
That is yet another irresponsible
rumour I'd like to put an end to.

198
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,719
Name's Amanda Givens
and as I said. Mr Bishop.

199
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,769
We have it on a very reliable source.

200
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,359

201
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,039
Would you care
to address this rumour?

202
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,959
I'll be very happy
to address and terminate it.

203
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,962
Thank you. Bobby.

204
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,119
I've just come from
the President of the United States

205
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,079
and he has assured me that despite
small differences between us.

206
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,199
That from here on out it will be...

207
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,439
...business as usual.

208
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,399
Yes. Bobby!

209
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,399
Next question.

210
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,880

212

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,319

215

We've got it done.

216

Hi, how are you'?

217
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,159
Oh. Oscar and Bertha!

218
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,003
WOMAN: How are you'?
Always a pleasure. Good!

219
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,999
Boy. oh. boy.
you are some kinda big shot!

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,159
I could have sworn
it was just last week

221
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,969
you were stuffing envelopes
and licking stamps.

222
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,610
That was last week.

223
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,170
It was. wasn't it?

224
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,810
Mmm.

225
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,999
You gotta try some of this vodka
the Finns sent us.

226
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,799
It's fantastic.

227
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,319
Couple of good shots
and you're Eric the Great.

228
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,759
Eric the Great never made it to 60.

229
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,439
I. on the other hand.
am alive and going strong

230
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,199
simply because
I have always restricted myself

231
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,599
to slowly sipping old reliable.

232
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,999
And eating apple pie.
Mm-hm.

233
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,759
And making love like a missionary.

234
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,959
And sailing that yacht of yours
around the Chesapeake.

235
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,759
I tell you. Bobby.
when I'm out on that bay.

236
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,839
All the crap that we go through every day

237
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,839
just to try and keep this country
from going under washes off me.

238
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,879
And I look back at that shore

239
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,599
and my mind is clear -
crystal clear.

240
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,519
And I rediscover Virginia
the way it used to be.

241
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,569
God. that sounds like
Thomas Jefferson. doesn't it?

242
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,519
(Sighs) Ah. Jake.

243
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,999
We kicked some butt today.

244
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,199
You did. Bobby.

245
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,279
He who gets the first sound bite wins.

246
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,199
(Sighs) Bobby. Bobby. Bobby.

247
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,999
You've learned faster and better
than anyone I've ever seen

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,599
how to play the game around here.

249
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,159
I think I feel some more
fatherly advice coming on.

250
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,799
Well. then listen up. son.

251
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,359
The ritual. the manoeuvring -
that's all it is. It's just a game.

252
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,839
And your precious sound bites?

253
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,439
They're like a drug. They get you high.

254
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,039
You think you've achieved something.
but in reality.

255
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,567
It's nothing but shallow.
superficial. pointless manipulation.

256
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,522
I wrote a lot of that speech
he was gonna give. Jake.

257
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,806
I know.

258
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,599
Want my car to give you a lift?

259
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,279
No. I'll just walk. thanks.

please see if our table is ready?

you have on Congressman Page. hmm?

as you screwed me today.

waiting to take a shot at me.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out

351
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,279
that something really fucked up
is going on here.

352
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,279
Well. somebody set us up. Bobby.

353
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,439
Literally in 10 minutes they set us up.

354
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,159
You have to come in.
Tell us where you are.

355
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,279
No. Bobby. what did
Pochenko say exactly?

356
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,239
He just said that something was
going on at the highest level.

357
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,039
Something about us
watching each other.

358
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,202
He said there was this program
that pointed to it.

359
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,079
What does that mean?

360
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,799
I don't have a fucking clue.

361
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,879
It's your move. Bobby.

362
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,839
I need some time.

363
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,684
You Wait. I'll find you.

364
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,967
We should call the FBI
and the DC police.

365
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,722
That's the President's decision.

366
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,999
Who did this?

Answers. gentlemen.

368
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,839
He's a Special Assistant
to the President. goddammit.

369
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,879
What are you doing to stop this?

370
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,519
Mr President. we're dealing with
a highly trained killer here.

in the intelligence community.

373
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,239
Yes. but what puzzles me
is why Bishop?

374
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,799
Out of all our senior officials.
why go after him?

375
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,768
Is he involved with something?

376
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,399
Bishop's integrity is not in question.

377
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Get him off the street and get
to the bottom of this - quietly.

378
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,159
Bobby needs more time. sir.
until he can...

379
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,679
Until he gets himself killed.

on the theory of a shadow government
inside the White House?

that article was absurd.
