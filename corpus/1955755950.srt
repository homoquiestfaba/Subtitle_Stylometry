1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,583
( Chattering )

2
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,542
- ( music playing )
- ( audience cheering )

3
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,541
Thank you.

4
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:46,250
Oh, my gosh.

5
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,500
Are you kidding me?

6
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,750
My goodness.

7
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:03,290
( Chuckles )

8
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,124
Wow, thank you.

9
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,582
- People are like, "Tig!"
- ( audience laughs )

10
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,749
"Why are you shooting
your special in Boston?"

11
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,124
( audience laughs )

12
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,958
Woman: Whoo!

13
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,541
I'll tell ya something,

14
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,499
my grandfather...

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,332
was originally from Boston.

16
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,124
( Audience cheers )

17
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,999
And my mother

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,916
lived in Boston

19
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,625
when she was a tiny,
little person.

20
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,959
- Man: Whoo!
- And this rug...

21
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:46,958
Hear me out.
This rug I am standing on

22
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,666
has been in my family

23
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,499
since the 1800s

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,374
and was in my mother's house
in Boston

25
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,708
- in the '40s.
- ( audience cheers )

26
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:03,291
Why am I shooting
my special...

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,708
in Boston?

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,041
- I wanted to show you my rug.
- ( audience laughs )

29
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,416
Why am I shooting
my special in Boston?

30
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:23,374
No more stupid questions.

31
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,750
( laughs )
Please.

32
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,541
I performed in Las Vegas

33
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:34,040
and, um, when you do
stand-up in Vegas,

34
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,124
typically, you have to do
an entire week,

35
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,791
seven nights in a row,

36
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,332
two shows a night.

37
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,874
There's an early show
and a late show,

38
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,499
and I bombed

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,290
all 14...

40
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,249
( audience laughs )

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,457
shows.

42
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,999
And I'm not a huge drinker
and I don't really gamble,

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,082
so I didn't know what to do
between the early and late show.

44
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:05,082
So the first night I thought
I'd hang out in my hotel room,

45
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,290
but it was so far away
from the venue

46
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,416
that I only had
enough time

47
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:16,583
to walk back
to my room...

48
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,458
stand like this
for two minutes...

49
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:27,250
and then head back
to the Comedy Club.

50
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,958
The rest of the time,
I thought,

51
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,958
"I'll just sit in the
back corner of the club,"

52
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,958
hang out
between the shows,

53
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,666
"and just kill time
having a glass of water."

54
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,624
I'm sitting there

55
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,207
and my agent

56
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:49,290
calls me to tell me

57
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,624
that the venue

58
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,582
called him

59
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,290
to say
that they thought

60
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,124
it was weird...

61
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,249
( audience laughs )

62
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,250
that I was just sitting
in the back corner...

63
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,874
and could I please leave

64
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,959
and go find
something else to do.

65
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,124
So, again, I'm sitting there,
my phone rings,

66
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm like,
"Hey, what's going on?"

67
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,125
( audience laughs )

68
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,333
"Oh.

69
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,125
Okay."

70
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,833
So humiliating!

71
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:45,916
It's not like
that call

72
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,749
came from some far-off
headquarters someplace.

73
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,374
That call came
from inside the club.

74
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,332
I'm certain the guy was looking
through a little window

75
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,833
staring at me
with disgust on his face.

76
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:05,000
Just like, "Ugh, tell her
to get out of here."

77
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,708
Yeah, I'm sick
of looking at her face."

78
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:13,791
I still didn't know
where to go or what to do.

79
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:17,624
So I took the escalator
down to the first floor

80
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:22,833
and there's an ice
cream shop down there.

81
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,958
And I'm an adult.

82
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,624
I just... personally,
I don't sit alone

83
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,416
in ice cream shops

84
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,959
- just...
- ( audience laughs )

85
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,582
And let me be certain...

86
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,499
to not use...

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,542
the object
that is the exact shape...

88
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:58,125
of an ice cream cone.

89
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,792
( Audience laughing )

90
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:23,332
So I finished
my ice cream cone,

91
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,666
I took the escalator
back up,

92
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,124
I did the final show,

93
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,583
and, of course,
I bombed.

94
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,833
I got offstage.

95
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,207
I shook hands
with the audience members.

96
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,500
And they were just like...

97
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,374
"We hate you."

98
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,749
I was like,
"Feeling is mutual."

99
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,083
I said goodbye to the other comedians.
They hated me, too.

100
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,125
Then I went into the
office and got paid.

101
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,124
Then I walked all the way
back to my hotel room.

102
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,499
I put my pajamas on.

103
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,542
I had little pigs
flying all over my pants.

104
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:17,124
I looked so adorable.

105
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,625
It was like my one tiny
victory for the whole week.

106
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:27,542
And then I went into the
bathroom to brush my tooth.

107
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,457
And that's when I caught
my reflection in the mirror

108
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,999
and saw that I had

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,791
a full-blown

110
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:45,834
chocolate mustache
on my face.

111
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,040
I was like, "No!"

112
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,749
My brain starts replaying
everything

113
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,917
that had
just happened to me.

114
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,624
I was onstage
for an entire hour...

115
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,541
bombing...

116
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:08,000
with a chocolate mustache
on my face.

117
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:13,667
And then remember all up
close and personal, I was...

118
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,207
Not one person...

119
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,040
was like, "Oh."

120
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,666
You have..."

121
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,457
"You..."
Uh-uh, nobody told me.

122
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,582
And then I went
into the office

123
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,708
to get paid...

124
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,666
by the guy
that I am certain

125
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,582
made that original
phone call

126
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,541
telling me
to please leave

127
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:47,417
and go find
something else to do.

128
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,541
Guess who found
something else to do?

129
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,916
- Woman: Whoo!
- Me.

130
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,541
I did.

131
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:01,125
I went and treated myself
to a little chocolate ice cream.

132
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,082
What is my problem?

133
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,541
I am six years from 50.

134
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,040
Can I not
just glance in the mirror

135
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,833
before I go onstage?

136
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,125
What is my to-do list
every night?

137
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,666
Belly full of ice cream.

138
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,834
Check.

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,083
- Head onstage.
- ( audience laughs )

140
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,707
What did the owner of the
club think as I sat there

141
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:49,040
across the desk
in a tiny office

142
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,999
with a chocolate mustache
on my face?

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,416
A grown woman...

144
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:59,499
wanting to get paid
for 14 bombed shows.

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,458
Holding out
my little paw.

146
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,999
Did he think that I just
grabbed an ice cream cone

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,416
out of the hand
of a small child,

148
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:24,290
slammed it
in my own face,

149
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,666
hopped back up onstage?

150
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,999
Not so funny anymore,
is it, Vegas?

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,583
I'm nuts.

152
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:41,500
Or did he think that I was
trying to disguise myself...

153
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,666
with a fake mustache,

154
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:49,917
trying to sneak back into the
venue he had kicked me out of?

155
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:01,250
Sorry, this bit goes as long
as whatever stage I'm on.

156
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,833
( Whistling )

157
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,749
Oh, great, there's stairs.

158
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,792
( Groans )

159
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,707
Guys, relax!

160
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,875
Relax,
I'm just a person.

161
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,708
What if somebody walked
into the show right now...

162
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,791
and they didn't
recognize me?

163
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:37,999
"I thought Tig was supposed
to be taping her special."

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,165
Where did she go?

165
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,833
"Where's Tig?"

166
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,249
Guys, it's me.

167
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,916
It's me.

168
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,458
It's me.

169
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,541
Uh, where did Tig go?

170
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,457
Where did Tig go?

171
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,249
Where did Tig go?

172
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,666
Let me see
your little belly.

173
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:02,124
Where did Tig go?
Oh, there I am.

174
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,166
Oh, you guys are dumb.

175
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,958
Oh, my gosh.

176
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,082
As a comedian,
people always ask me

177
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,457
what makes me laugh
really hard.

178
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,374
And, um, I was making
a video one time.

179
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,707
Just like a funny sketch
with a friend of mine

180
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,499
where at the end
he ends up in a bathtub

181
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,499
with Santa Claus.

182
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,582
And there are websites
that you can go on

183
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,791
and find your perfect,
ideal Santa,

184
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:40,792
click on him, hire him for
all your Santa Claus needs.

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,582
We could not find
the perfect Santa Claus.

186
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,332
And he said, "Do you
mind if we take a break"

187
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,833
and go to McDonald's so I can
get a couple hamburgers?

188
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,165
"And then we'll come back."

189
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,499
And I said,
"Man, whatever you need."

190
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,124
We go through the drive-thru,
he gets his hamburgers.

191
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,541
He said,
"I cannot wait to eat these."

192
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,457
Do you mind
if we just sit here

193
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,249
"and I eat 'em
and then we go back?"

194
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,749
I said again,
"Whatever you need."

195
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,833
So he backs his car
into this space

196
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:17,040
and we're now looking out over the
entire McDonald's parking lot

197
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,874
and I see this woman
off in the distance

198
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,666
acting utterly insane.

199
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,499
And I said,

200
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,666
"What do you think
she's doing?"

201
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,666
And he said,
"I don't know,

202
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,708
but I'm gonna film her."

203
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,958
He gets his phone out,
he presses record,

204
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,958
and you guys are me and him in the
car looking through the windshield.

205
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,332
The second he pressed record,

206
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,791
a boat of a car
drove past us

207
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,082
and a man turned

208
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,207
and it was Santa Claus.

209
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,749
And I yelled, "Oh, my God,
it's Santa Claus!"

210
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,207
And he yelled, "Oh, my God, do
you think he'll talk to us?"

211
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,249
And then he shut off
the phone, we peel out

212
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,332
and just haul ass
chasing Santa Claus

213
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,666
down the street.

214
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,290
And we come up next to him
at the light

215
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,916
and I realize in that moment
I hadn't thought about

216
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,666
what I was gonna say
when we caught him.

217
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,290
And I said, "Hi."

218
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:23,250
Um, you know
who you look like, right?"

219
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:28,082
And he said,
"Santa Claus."

220
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,582
And I said, "Yes."

221
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,290
I said, "My friend and I
are making a video"

222
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,624
and we wanted to hire you
to be in it."

223
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,791
He hands me
his business card

224
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,290
and as he's driving off

225
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,958
I look at it

226
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,916
and it said his name

227
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:50,457
at some very
conservative church dot-org.

228
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,249
And I said, "Oh, man."

229
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,959
This guy is not gonna get
into a bathtub with you."

230
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,125
Or maybe he will.

231
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,833
So we drive off
feeling defeated

232
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:13,082
and then I start thinking
about that video from earlier.

233
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,457
And I started laughing.

234
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,124
And I asked him to pull the car
over to play it back for us

235
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,499
and he said, "Why?"

236
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,165
And I said,
"Because I feel confident"

237
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,833
that we captured

238
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:30,124
the most ridiculous
footage

239
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:34,999
"since the beginning
of time."

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,541
And then he
started thinking about it

241
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:40,791
and then we were
both hunched over

242
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:44,290
laughing so hard,
hyperventilating,

243
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:50,249
crying, trying to push each
other away from each other.

244
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,999
We were laughing so hard,
we both became ugly people.

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,124
And we still hadn't even
seen the video yet.

246
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,958
And then he pulls
the car over

247
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,207
and he presses play

248
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,499
and you don't see that woman
off in the distance.

249
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,457
It's like she was never
a part of this.

250
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,707
The second he pressed play,

251
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,583
the only thing
that you see...

252
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,958
is a boat of a car

253
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,207
driving past us

254
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,875
and a man turning...

255
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,749
and you hear me

256
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,208
earnestly...

257
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:36,916
yell, "Oh, my God,
it's Santa Claus!"

258
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:40,333
And you see my hand
just dart up into the video.

259
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,082
And then you hear my friend,

260
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,207
a full-grown man,

261
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,208
yell, "Oh, my God, do you
think he'll talk to us?"

262
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,041
And then it just
shuts out.

263
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:09,249
If anybody came across
that video footage

264
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,749
with zero backstory,

265
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,165
it truly appears

266
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:21,708
as though two
full-grown buffoons...

267
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:28,083
thought that they
saw Santa Claus.

268
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:33,750
And what is my friend's history
with Santa Claus...

269
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,750
that his response...

270
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,750
would be, "Oh, my God, do you
think he'll talk to us?"

271
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:51,791
Just an entire lifetime
of him running up to Santa

272
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:55,291
only to be met with...

273
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,750
But Santa...

274
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:14,959
I love everybody's
little laugh noises.

275
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,666
My favorite laugh noise
is, um, the sigh

276
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,833
after the laugh.

277
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:26,291
The...
( sighs )

278
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,374
( laughs )

279
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,291
( sighs )

280
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,834
'Cause it's like you're
reminiscing about one second ago.

281
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,916
( laughs )

282
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,208
( sighs )

283
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,166
Remember one second ago?

284
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,667
( Sighs )

285
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,750
Yeah, that was
a good time.

286
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,290
Yeah.

287
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,290
My other favorite
laugh noise

288
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,582
is the pig snort.

289
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:12,249
You know, when somebody is just
really enjoying themselves.

290
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,834
And then...
( snorts )

291
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,999
Because I'm always curious,

292
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,375
is that something
they decided to do?

293
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,833
Like a calculated decision.

294
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:29,959
Or are they just as
surprised as we are...

295
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:37,874
when a pig snort
flies out of their face?

296
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,874
I like to think
it's the other option

297
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,375
where they're just like,
"You know what?"

298
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,875
I have been laughing...

299
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,416
and smiling...

300
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,040
and clapping

301
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,916
all night,

302
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,582
but I still feel

303
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,916
like she doesn't get...

304
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,583
how much I get her.

305
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,458
Think I'm gonna go ahead
and snort like a pig.

306
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,749
Yeah, this, uh...
This story she's telling,

307
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,249
this is actually one of my
favorites I was telling...

308
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,458
"Oh, hold on one second."

309
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,417
( snorts )

310
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,707
"Love your stuff."

311
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,834
( snorts )

312
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,290
My dream situation

313
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,290
is actually the...
At the end of the night

314
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,791
when the lights go on

315
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,749
that there is an actual pig
in the audience.

316
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,666
Just out on the town,
pantless,

317
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,958
clanking its little
cloven hooves together.

318
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,166
Sitting on
its little curlicue.

319
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,707
Comes up to me
at the end of the night,

320
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,792
"Hey, um, that was me."

321
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,165
I, uh... I can't laugh,
so I snort.

322
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,875
Sure, I can talk...

323
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,040
but I wanted to say

324
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,916
I really liked that part
earlier

325
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:28,500
when you were talking about
having little pigs on your pants.

326
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,416
Anyway,
I don't wanna keep you,

327
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,667
I just... I really
just wanted to say...

328
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,667
I just wanted to say
pig fan, pig fan.

329
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:46,166
Boston, that's a terrible joke.
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,999
( laughs ) Sorry, I'm
just up here being a ham

331
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,541
and I... I'm sor...
That's too much,

332
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:56,624
you're right.
( chuckles )

333
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,999
Too many puns eventually
becomes a "boar"

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,165
and I don't wanna...

335
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,040
Don't shake your head
at me.

336
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:07,208
I will reimburse you.
I am sorry.

337
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,082
I'm originally
from Mississippi.

338
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,082
- Man: Whoo!
- Um...

339
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,290
( audience laughs )

340
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,917
Settle down, everyone.

341
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,416
I'm originally
from Mississippi

342
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:27,165
and, um, my fiancée

343
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,917
- is, um...
- ( audience cheering )

344
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,707
Thank you. Um...

345
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:37,083
- He is from...
- ( audience laughs )

346
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,542
Okay.

347
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,457
She was raised in Los
Angeles and New York

348
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:01,082
and I invited her
back to Mississippi

349
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:05,749
to spend the holidays with
me and my extended family.

350
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,082
And before the trip,

351
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,457
she said, um,

352
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,290
"No offense, but..."

353
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:18,166
And I said, "Yes, what is this
flattering thing you're about to say?"

354
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:23,124
She said, "When I picture
people from Mississippi",

355
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,667
I picture them barefoot."

356
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,166
Thank you.

357
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:35,124
And I said,
"Okay, I get it, but, um,"

358
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:39,666
my family is civilized.

359
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,207
They have homes

360
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,499
and jobs

361
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,332
and shoes,

362
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,874
"but I hear ya."

363
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:51,332
So I was down there
hanging out before she arrived,

364
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:55,332
and when you fly in
to visit my town,

365
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,791
you fly in
to the New Orleans airport.

366
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:01,958
And all 11
of my family members

367
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,457
piled into a van

368
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:07,040
to drive into the French
Quarter to hang out,

369
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,624
wait until she arrived.

370
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,165
And I finally was like, "Oh, yeah,
she's gonna be landing soon."

371
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,666
We gotta go."

372
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,374
All 11 of them

373
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,707
piled back into the van
with their beers...

374
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,999
I don't know if you know,
but it is legal down there

375
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,874
to have open containers
in vehicles.

376
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,999
They all get in.

377
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,666
They also brought
a cooler

378
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,666
iced down
with extra beer

379
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:36,083
just for the drive
to the airport.

380
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,749
I offered to be
the sober driver,

381
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,874
not that anybody in my
family cared either way.

382
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,500
They were just like,
"Okay, nerd."

383
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:55,082
So we pull up curbside

384
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,791
at baggage claim

385
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:00,707
and I get out and say,
"I will be right back."

386
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:04,375
I go in, I find her.

387
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,916
We're walking out
chatting.

388
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,291
She looks up...

389
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,165
and she said,
"Is that your family?"

390
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,916
I look up

391
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:20,040
and all 11 of them

392
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,332
have gotten out
of the van.

393
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,874
They're smoking
and drinking,

394
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,749
they're waving wildly,

395
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,749
so excited to meet her.

396
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,083
They've pulled the cooler
out onto the sidewalk.

397
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,625
And they were barefoot.

398
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,124
After walking around
the French Quarter all day,

399
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,792
they took their shoes off
on the drive to get her.

400
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,417
So there I was...

401
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,124
having to say,
"Yes,"

402
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,458
that is
my civilized family...

403
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,749
that I told you about.

404
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,457
"There they are
in all of their glory."

405
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,833
So we have the holidays,
Christmas, whatever,

406
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:15,749
she and I are driving
out of town together

407
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,874
and, uh,
I asked her if, uh...

408
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,833
A couple years ago
my mother passed away

409
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:22,999
and we buried her
in our hometown in Mississippi

410
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,249
and I asked if we could
go visit her grave.

411
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,165
And she said of course.

412
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,165
And just to back up
a little more,

413
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:34,499
when my stepfather and I were
driving away from the funeral,

414
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,791
he told me,

415
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,999
"When your mother died,"

416
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,582
they were offering
a really good deal

417
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,792
on burial plots.

418
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,958
I ended up getting six

419
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,500
"for a thousand dollars."

420
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,999
He said,
"I got one for your mother,"

421
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,249
I got one for me,

422
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,541
I got one for you,

423
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:06,124
I got one
for your brother,

424
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,500
"and then I got two extras."

425
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,750
Man: Whoo!

426
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:20,207
I said, "That is serious
bargain shopping"

427
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:24,082
just to toss in
two extra burial plots."

428
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,165
And he said, "Well, I
thought I would get those"

429
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:29,541
in case you or your brother,
if you had partners one day."

430
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,582
And I said,
"Oh, well, thank you,

431
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,208
but still..."

432
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:40,707
So my girlfriend and I
pull up to the graveyard,

433
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,708
we get out of the car...

434
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,875
we walk over,
we're standing there.

435
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,958
She's looking around.

436
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,542
She said,
"This is really beautiful."

437
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:05,124
She said, "So is it just...
Is it just this right here?"

438
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:08,416
And I said, "Well..."
( exhales )

439
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:11,250
"That's the thing, um..."

440
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,541
When my mother died,

441
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:17,750
they were offering
a really good deal.

442
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,999
Six plots
for a thousand dollars.

443
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,249
So my stepfather...

444
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,791
my mother,
she's just buried right here,

445
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,749
but he got hers,

446
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,833
and then one for him,

447
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,916
he got one for me,

448
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,791
he got one for my brother.

449
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:43,291
And then, um...

450
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:53,291
He got two extras...

451
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:57,250
in case we had partners.

452
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,625
So, um...

453
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,458
I guess, um...

454
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:08,750
I guess that's where
you'll be gay buried.

455
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,207
Barefoot in Mississippi,

456
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:22,500
"just like you always
imagined."

457
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:28,834
She thought it was some
twisted marriage proposal.

458
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,207
After my mother passed away,

459
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:35,082
I was diagnosed
with bilateral breast cancer,

460
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:40,040
um, but I have not
told anybody yet.

461
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:42,166
( Audience laughs )

462
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,959
You're the first people
to find out.

463
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,208
Wow, that's
a very cold response.

464
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,542
( Sighs )

465
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,874
I ended up having
a double mastectomy,

466
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,165
and, um,

467
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:07,499
before my surgery, I was already
relatively flat-chested.

468
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,666
And, uh, I made so many jokes
over the years

469
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,624
about how small
my boobs were

470
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,749
that I started to think

471
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,040
that maybe

472
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:24,041
my boobs overheard me...

473
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:30,750
and were just like,
"Pfft."

474
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,041
You know what?

475
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,375
We're sick of this.

476
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,542
"Let's kill her."

477
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,625
I'm always thrown off
by the clapping.

478
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,125
Whoo, take her down!

479
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:05,582
I did a show where this
woman sat front row

480
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:09,541
with her arms crossed
shaking her head at me.

481
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,916
And I said,
"Is there something wrong?"

482
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,457
And she said,

483
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,999
"You should end your jokes

484
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,625
with 'I'm just kidding.'"

485
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,916
Oh, right, right.

486
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,959
I don't know why I never
thought about that.

487
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,874
That is a great idea.

488
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,874
I'm just kidding.

489
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,541
I'm not kid...
I really did have cancer,

490
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:41,874
I just... I don't really
think that my boobs

491
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:45,959
were conspiring
to kill me.

492
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,083
That I'm kidding about.

493
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:58,250
( Sighs )
Yeah.

494
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,834
Oh, we remember.

495
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,916
Before I had
my double mastectomy,

496
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:11,332
I, um... I would sometimes
be mistaken for a man.

497
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:14,040
And, um, that's fine.

498
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,207
But then after the surgery,

499
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,165
it went up a bit.

500
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,916
I was going through security
at the airport

501
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,707
and, um...

502
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,082
they said,
"Female assist,"

503
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:30,457
which means they have to have a
female officer pat me down extra.

504
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,833
And so this woman
comes over

505
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:36,833
and she comes in,
just...

506
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:39,499
And I didn't have
reconstructive surgery.

507
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,541
I just...
She was like...

508
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,375
( audience laughs )

509
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,457
She didn't feel
a boob or...

510
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,707
a bra or anything.

511
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,040
And she said,
"Hold on a second."

512
00:32:56,041 --> 00:33:00,500
And she walked
only maybe this far away.

513
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:04,958
And she whispered something
to the other officer.

514
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,374
And I just heard him say,

515
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,457
"Yes, I'm positive."

516
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,500
( audience laughs )

517
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,833
So she comes back over

518
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:19,583
and she's like...

519
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,249
But this time she stopped

520
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,499
before she touched me

521
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,916
and she looked up...

522
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,416
at my face...

523
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,499
She really took it in.

524
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,999
But apparently,

525
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,290
that was not helpful

526
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,749
at all.

527
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,541
- And she said, "Hold on a
second." - ( audience laughing )

528
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:49,416
She walks back over

529
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:53,791
and whispers something again
to the officer

530
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:56,207
and he just says, "Yes."

531
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,457
And the thing is,

532
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:02,833
I knew exactly
what was happening

533
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:06,541
and I knew that
all I needed to do

534
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,541
was speak...

535
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:13,040
and then she would know
that I was female.

536
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:16,499
But I just did not

537
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,457
- wanna help her out...
- ( audience laughing )

538
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:23,416
- Man: Whoo!
- ( audience cheering )

539
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:24,833
at all.

540
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:29,791
I was enjoying
the awkwardness so much.

541
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:33,291
I just loved
standing there like...

542
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:47,125
She finally came back over
and said, "You're good."

543
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,290
And I walked off saying,

544
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:53,333
( imitates deep voice) "Uh, thank you.
Thank you very much."

545
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,458
Oh, my gosh,
you guys are so nice.

546
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,207
I, um...

547
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:06,374
- have really been s...
- ( audience catcalls )

548
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:11,332
- Do not tempt me.
- ( audience laughs )

549
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,833
- I will do it. I will... I will...
- ( audience cheering )

550
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:18,125
Guys... guys, no.

551
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,166
( Audience cheering )

552
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:29,040
Of course I'm not gonna
take my shirt off on my sp...

553
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,583
( audience groans,
cheers )

554
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,875
- ( man whistling )
- No.

555
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,000
( Audience cheering )

556
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,542
Woman: Whoo!

557
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,583
So...

558
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,083
( man whistling )

559
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,833
I'll tell you,
I, uh...

560
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:23,874
I am afraid to fly

561
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:27,791
and I... I am.
Sure, laugh all you want,

562
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:31,582
but I...
I'm very afraid to fly

563
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:37,374
and I went on a plane that
seated maybe only six people.

564
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,666
And you c...
It was so tiny

565
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:43,749
that you could only
kind of crouch

566
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,207
to get through
the plane.

567
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,916
And, um...

568
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:49,749
oh, my God,
it was so small.

569
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,624
And once we got
to our cruising altitude,

570
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,165
we're flying along
and the pilot,

571
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,082
who's just sitting
right there,

572
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,290
he's just like,
"Hey, how's it going?"

573
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,499
And, um...
( laughs )

574
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,834
You do your thing,
I'll do mine.

575
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:07,833
He gets out of his seat

576
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,457
and just is like,

577
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,332
"Let me show you

578
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,249
where the emergency
toilet is."

579
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,833
And I said,

580
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,792
- "I'll decide where the emergency
toilet is." - ( audience laughing )

581
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:29,000
"How about here? How about
this is the emergency toilet?"

582
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:35,165
Or how about right here? This
could be the emergency toilet.

583
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:39,582
How about anywhere I decide
is the emergency toilet?

584
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:43,332
This entire flight
feels like an emergency.

585
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:48,542
Just one huge emergency toilet
flying through the air.

586
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:53,541
Now go sit back down,
you joker.

587
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:57,082
"Don't you worry
about the emergency toilet."

588
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:00,666
I love on, um,
commercial flights

589
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:04,499
when, um, you're seated
in the emergency exit row

590
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,874
and the flight
attendant's like,

591
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,457
"You know,
just wondering"

592
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,416
if in the event
of an emergency,

593
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:13,542
"you'd be willing
to help out."

594
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,333
And I'm like, "Pfft..."

595
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,375
Totally.

596
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,749
If you need anything,

597
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,041
you come grab me.

598
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:35,207
But I was just wondering if
maybe we could wait and see

599
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:38,249
what kind of shape
I'm in

600
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,000
after the plane plummets
30,000 feet.

601
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:46,875
'Cause I don't even know if I'm
gonna be sitting here anymore.

602
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:52,833
"But absolutely, you come grab
me if you need anything."

603
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:55,916
Are they really
gonna hold me to that?

604
00:38:55,917 --> 00:39:00,249
Where's that woman
from 12 E?

605
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,041
Where's that guy
from 12 E?

606
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,208
Nah, he said
he'd help us out.

607
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,291
I'm just off in the distance
gathering my own body parts.

608
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,959
Did somebody
need something?

609
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:26,375
I did give a verbal
confirmation, so...

610
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,624
Carrying my own head
in my hand.

611
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:34,875
Yeah, just let me know
what I can do for ya.

612
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,417
Oh, man, flying, huh?

613
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:45,417
( Audience cheering )

614
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,833
I've been traveling
around so much

615
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:59,124
and, um,

616
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,124
I've noticed
in the States...

617
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,666
I haven't really
noticed it so much

618
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,457
overseas anywhere,

619
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,249
but in the US

620
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,457
I've noticed
these signs

621
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,457
showing up
at public pools.

622
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:16,290
And, um, I'm sure plenty of you
have seen these,

623
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,707
and they say

624
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,999
that you cannot
go swimming

625
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,500
if you have diarrhea.

626
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:30,165
Raise your hand
if you've seen these signs.

627
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,124
Yes, these are
actual signs.

628
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,165
And my question is

629
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:39,125
how frequently
was this happening?

630
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,999
But, more importantly,

631
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,457
how confident of a person

632
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,458
do you have to be...

633
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:55,667
to be like,
"Oh, man."

634
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,667
Oh, man."
( exhales )

635
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,250
"I do not feel well."

636
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:17,417
Doctor said I should
definitely stay home.

637
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,875
Stick near the toilet.

638
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:29,542
- "But you know what?"
- ( audience laughs )

639
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:35,166
"I'm gonna head down
to the public pool."

640
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:40,332
Go swim around.

641
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:43,875
"With full blown diarrhea."

642
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,624
They're just like,
"Hey!

643
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:52,125
Out of the pool!"

644
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,999
Me?

645
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,875
Yeah, you can't swim
with diarrhea.

646
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:12,375
Oh, so this
is a problem?

647
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:17,875
Yeah, gotta get out
of the pool.

648
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,916
Listen...

649
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,999
if you don't want me
swimming

650
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,624
with diarrhea,

651
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:33,125
then you're gonna need
to hang up a sign.

652
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:42,583
Otherwise, there's just
no possible way...

653
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:47,416
( chuckles )
I would know better.

654
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:50,625
So until that goes...

655
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:56,624
Thank you so much.

656
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:57,791
No, no, no, no.

657
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:00,500
I'm not... I'm not leaving,
I'm not leaving.

658
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,791
I have a weird delivery.

659
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,791
- It...
- ( audience laughing )

660
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:07,249
I've had it my whole life,
my whole career.

661
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,667
Sounds like I'm leaving, but
I'm just saying thank you.

662
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,208
It's kind of like you guys
really got that, thanks!

663
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,874
( Sighs )
I have a gift for you all.

664
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,666
Uh, something that brings me
a lot of joy in my life.

665
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,082
I wanna give it to you

666
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:31,165
so that you can experience
the happiness

667
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,332
that I do.

668
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,666
I love...

669
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:40,082
sending text messages
to friends of mine

670
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:43,249
at random times
of the day

671
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,792
that just say,
"What's your ETA?"

672
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,958
I just love knowing
that somewhere across town

673
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:00,958
somebody is half-naked

674
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,207
frantically rifling

675
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,999
through emails
and text messages

676
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,040
trying to figure out

677
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:11,333
what they agreed
to do with me.

678
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,708
And they write back,
"What?"

679
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,541
And then write back,

680
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:21,875
"Yeah, we're all seated.
Better hurry."

681
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:29,000
And then they write back,
"Where?"

682
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,582
And then don't respond.

683
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,499
Ever again.

684
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,874
Cut them out of your life.
Delete them from your phone.

685
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,416
Just move on.
It was time.

686
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:44,959
It was time
and you both knew it.

687
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:50,750
- Thank you!
- ( audience laughs )

688
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:55,375
Thank you so much.

689
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,875
Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

690
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,290
( Sighs )

691
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,040
I've been doing stand-up
for almost 20 years now

692
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:19,583
and... every show
I've ever done...

693
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:23,082
whether it was
a coffee shop,

694
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,707
an open mic,

695
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,541
a sold-out theater,

696
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,124
a college,

697
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,833
a club,

698
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:35,541
every single show
I've ever done,

699
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:39,874
- I've gotten a standing ovation.
- ( audience laughing )

700
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,667
Oh, sure,
laugh all you want.

701
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,416
Even in Vegas

702
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:49,959
I got 14
standing ovations.

703
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,457
You might be thinking,
"I had a good time tonight,

704
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:59,332
but not like... not 'standing
ovation' good time."

705
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:02,249
Everybody thinks that.

706
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,249
Everybody thinks that
and then sure enough,

707
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,499
the show ends and everyone
jumps to their feet

708
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,499
and they're yelling,
"Tig!"

709
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,582
We love you!

710
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:20,165
"This is the best comedy show
we've ever seen in our lives."

711
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:23,792
And I'm just like,
"I'm just a person.

712
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,332
Please be seated."

713
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,666
And they won't.

714
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,833
And that goes on

715
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:36,333
for three minutes
every single time.

716
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,541
So I'm just giving you
a heads up what's to come.

717
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:44,041
( Audience laughing )

718
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,999
I love music.

719
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,708
( Audience laughing )

720
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,333
I've never detected
a punch line there.

721
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,040
Maybe I should
listen more.

722
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:08,375
( Man laughing loudly )

723
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:13,374
Sounded like a cartoon character
showed up.

724
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,875
( Imitates laughing )

725
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,332
I like your style,
ha, ha, ha!

726
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:27,040
That was funny,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

727
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,582
I can barely take this,
I'm laughing so hard.

728
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,916
Ha, ha, ha!

729
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:36,041
That's all I wanted,
to laugh.

730
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,582
I do... I do love music

731
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:47,082
and, um, I would constantly
write down all the lyrics

732
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,083
to every Beatles song.

733
00:47:48,084 --> 00:47:50,249
Like put the record on,
take the needle off,

734
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,374
and write the lyrics down,
put the needle back on.

735
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:55,624
Just every song.
Obsessed.

736
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:59,207
And my grandmother ended up
having Alzheimer's

737
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:03,666
and she collected anything
that we touched growing up.

738
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:06,541
And towards the end of her life
when I was an adult,

739
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:08,791
she called me
into her bedroom.

740
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:12,040
And she pulled out
this box and this paper.

741
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:15,874
She said,
"You wrote this for me

742
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:19,290
- "when you were little."
- ( audience laughing )

743
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:23,707
And it was
"When I'm 64."

744
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:27,667
And I had to sit there
and take credit...

745
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:33,624
for a Lennon
and McCartney tune.

746
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:38,165
I was like, "Oh, that's right.
I forgot about that one."

747
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,374
( chuckles )
"You like that, huh?"

748
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:44,207
If so, I have a huge catalogue
of other...

749
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:47,500
"Other songs
I think you might like."

750
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:53,040
In sixth grade,
I took a music class

751
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,541
and, um, we were lectured
about anywhere

752
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:59,749
from The Who
to Beethoven.

753
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,332
We played instruments,
we read books.

754
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:05,207
And at the end
of every session,

755
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,416
the teacher
would always ask

756
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,999
if somebody had a favorite
song they wanted to play.

757
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,958
And I always brought in Beatles
and Rolling Stones songs.

758
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:15,958
And one day,

759
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:20,249
the coolest kid
in the entire school...

760
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,541
His name was J.D...

761
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,500
- And he came...
- ( audience chuckles )

762
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,499
Oh, that's funny to you?

763
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,083
That is a child's name.

764
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,124
A child that is 44 now,
but it's still a child's name.

765
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,749
What is your name?

766
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,249
- Chris.
- Chris.

767
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,749
- The coolest kid in the entire school...
- ( audience laughing )

768
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,875
was named Chris.

769
00:49:47,834 --> 00:49:48,792
How does that feel?

770
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:53,166
Doesn't feel good,
does it, Chris? No.

771
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,582
J.D. came up to me
after class

772
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:01,916
and he said,
"If I bring in"

773
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:05,165
one of my dad's
Rolling Stones records,

774
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:08,416
"will you tell me the coolest
song on the album to play?"

775
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:11,208
And I said, "Pfft..."

776
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,625
No question."

777
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,707
The next day,

778
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:22,457
J.D. brought in his dad's Rolling
Stones album "Let It Bleed."

779
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,875
And I looked it over...

780
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:28,124
and I picked this song
and said,

781
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,249
"This is the coolest song
on the album."

782
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,040
And it was "You Can't
Always Get What You Want."

783
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:35,040
And he said,
"Are you positive"

784
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:37,249
that this is
the best song,

785
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,958
"the coolest song
on the album?"

786
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:42,250
I was like, "Man, I
couldn't be more positive."

787
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:45,791
And then the teacher asked

788
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,541
if anyone had brought in
their favorite song to play.

789
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,499
And J.D. raised his hand

790
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,541
and she called on him.

791
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:57,040
And that's when everybody

792
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,916
in sixth grade

793
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:02,207
heard the coolest kid

794
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,624
in the entire school

795
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,999

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,791

797
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:15,416

798
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:18,874
And I was like,
"No, no, it gets better."

What?

811
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,874
I told you.

Please, be seated.

know." - ( audience laughs )

What do you mean,
"you know"?

826
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:16,625
"I know."

827
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:24,291
Nobody's
shaking their fist.

828
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,082
Boston.

829
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:33,333

( Music playing )

834
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,792
( music ends )
