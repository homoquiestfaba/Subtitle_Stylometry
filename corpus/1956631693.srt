1
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,049
at last!

2
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,709
Snoke trained you well!

3
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,339
I killed Snoke.
I'll kill you.

4
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,689
My boy!

5
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,949
I made Snoke.

6
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:39,919
I have been every voice
you have ever heard inside your mind

7
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,099
The first order was just the beginning.

8
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,429
I will give you so much more...

9
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,829
- You'll die first.
- I died before.

10
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,699
The dark side of the force
is a path way to many abilities

11
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,129
some consider to be...

12
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,009
... unnatural.

13
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:32,209
What could you give me?

14
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,509
Everything!

15
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,069
A new empire!

16
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,009
The might of the final
order will soon be ready.

17
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:13,749
it will be yours
if you do as I ask.

18
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,729
Kill the girl!

19
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:18,849
 end the jedi,

20
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:23,979
and become what your
grandfather Walter could not...

21
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,069
You will rule all the galaxy
as the new emperor.

22
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,159
But be ware,
she is not who you think she is.

23
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,279
Who is she?

24
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,089
you ever gonna go?

25
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,700
- He can't beat us every time.
- apparently he does.

26
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,579
- How does he do it?
- Look at that, he really cheats...

27
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,200
- I'm kidding.
- Come on, take your turn...

28
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,600
You grabbed everything that's
how I think you're cheating...

29
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,559
Don't worry
we're not gonna turn it off.

30
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:31,269
- He's cheating.
- definitely

31
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:36,289
- I hope you fix that surge.
- Yes I did it.

32
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,179
- T minus five...
- R2!

33
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:58,919
good to see you!

34
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:03,549
- you got anything for us?
- A new ally, a spy in the 1st order

35
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,469
- A spy? Who?
- I don't know.

36
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,349
transfer the message, get it to Leia!
hurry!

37
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:14,459
this could be big, R2!

38
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,149
locked on target.

39
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:26,849
Finn!

40
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:30,279
- we'll meant to be cought!
- we're almost there.

41
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,839
-I got it.
- How do we thank you?

42
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,389
win the war!

43
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,809
Sorry, I'm sorry, I know...

44
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:55,879
Finn, we supposed to get
rid of these things.

45
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,659
- I got one. How many are left?
- too many.

46
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,199
What?

47
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:09,849
good thinking, Chewie.

48
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,379
- Finn, we can blow this tank.
- I was just thinking that.

49
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:31,079
how thin you think that wall is.

50
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,549
I know...

51
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,699
- What are you doing?
- light speed skipping.

52
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,309
How do you know how to do that?

53
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:00,699
Yeah, Rey's not here, is she?

54
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,979
last jump, may be forever.

55
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,209
hold on!

56
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,019
Be with me!

57
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,719
Be with me!

58
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,839
Be with me!

59
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,849
they're not with me, agh...

60
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,079
Rey, be patient.

61
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,969
I'm starting to think it's impossible,

62
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,139
to hear the voices of
the Jedi who can't be found.

63
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,879
Nothing is impossible.

64
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:54,879
Nothing is impossible.

65
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,749
I'm going run the training course.

66
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,389
BB-8, I'm so sorry.

67
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,739
I couldn't finish the training course.

68
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,519
I got distracted.

69
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:12,679
I'm just, not feeling myself,
I know it looks...

70
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,679
it looks like I'm hitting excuses.

71
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,639
Don't tell me what things look
like, tell me what they are.

72
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,909
I think I'm just tired, that's all.

73
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,739
General, "The falcon" still hasn't arrived,
commander is asking for guidance.

74
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:37,629
I will earn your brother's
laser sword, one day...

75
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:42,799
 No. you can't do it for me

76
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,109
Never underestimate a droid.

77
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,859
Yes master!

78
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,769
Rey!

79
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,629
The "Falcon" is back.

80
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,669
Come!  Come!

81
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:08,599
I need a volunteer here,
I don't need no one back, go, go...

82
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,399
it's all on fire.
all things on fire.

83
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:16,939
met the spy?

84
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,869
- really could uh, use your help out there.
- How did it go?

85
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,519
really bad actually, really bad.

86
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,679
- How's the ship...
- What did you do to the droid?

87
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,819
What did you do to the Falcon?

88
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,609
"The Falcon" is in a
lot better shape than he is.

89
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:29,059
- BB-8 is not on fire.
- What's left of him is on fire.

90
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,029
- Tell me what happened.
-  you tell me first.

91
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,859
You know what you are?
what? - you're difficult

92
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,049
You are a very difficult man....

93
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:36,849
- Ray! - Finn!

94
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:39,279
- you made it!
- yaeh, barely!

95
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,309
- so, bad mood?
- Me?

96
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,749
- Him.
- always.

97
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,319
Do we have spy?

98
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,379
You light speed skipped it.

99
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,709
- How? the compressor is down.
- I know, I was there.

100
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,749
You can't ride lightspeed skipped "Falcon".

101
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,579
- Alright guys, we just landed, OK?
- What happened?

102
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,029
Bad news, that's what happened.

103
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
- No spy?
- No, spy.

104
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,019
Did we make contact
with the spy or not?

105
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,009
there's a mole in the First order.
they sent us a message.

106
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,969
you dropped a tree on him?

107
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:09,059
You blowed both promoters...

108
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,529
You know I wanted be out there.

109
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,869
Yeah, but you're not,
you're here training. for what?

110
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:17,559
You're the best fighter we have,
We need you.

111
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:19,599
Out there, not here.

112
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,029
It's true.

113
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:26,949
What's the message?

114
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:30,279
We have decoded the information
from the first order spy,

115
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,949
and it confirmes the worst:

116
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:38,519
somehow Palpatine returned...

117
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:46,209
- Rey, Do we believe this?
- it can not be. the emperor is dead.

118
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,989
The dark side, cloning,
the secret message they sent you.

119
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:52,099
his with planning his revenge.

120
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:55,619
His followers have been building
something for years.

121
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:58,519
The largest fleet the
galaxy's ever known.

122
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,689
He calls it the final order.

123
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,639
In 16 hours, attacks on
all free worlds begin.

124
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:10,639
The emperor and his fleet are
hiding in the unknown regions,

125
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,969
in a world called EXEGOL.

126
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:18,269
EXEGOL does not
appear on any star chart,

127
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:22,589
but the legend describes it
as the hidden world of the Sith.

128
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,069
So Palpatine's been
out there all this time.

129
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,179
- holding his strength.
- Always in the shadows, form the beginning.

130
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,849
If we want to stop him,
we must find him.

131
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:42,849
We must find EXEGOL.

132
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,399
General, can I speak with you?

133
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,519
- I know how to get to EXEGOL.
- Tell me.

134
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:51,019
Luke searched for it for
a long time, he nearly found it

135
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,779
-There are ciphers here
I can't read.

136
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,519
but he said that to get there,
you need one of these...

137
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,300
A Sith way finder.

138
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,609
that compass is that lead
the way to EXEGOL.

139
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,519
To stop what we
both know is coming,

140
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,609
I need to finish
what Luke started.

141
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,849
Find EXEGOL to find the Emperor.

142
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,779
No!

143
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:15,389
I don't want to go without
your blessing, but I will.

144
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,979
I will.

145
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,209
 That's what you would do.

146
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,279
Are you gear up for running?

147
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:28,109
You were right before, I'm gonna
pick up next search for EXEGOL.

148
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,009
I'm gonna start where Lucas called
"the forbidden desert of Passana".

149
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:34,759
Yeah, I know, we're going with you.

150
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,279
Chewie, did you get
the compressor fixed?

151
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:38,919
I need to go alone.

152
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,439
- Yeah, alone with friends.
- It's too dangerous, Finn!

153
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,469
We go together.

154
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:50,229
I'm agree.

155
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,089
Rose, last chance.

156
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,189
The General asked me to
study expansible destroyers.

157
00:17:58,389 --> 00:17:59,479
so we can stop the fleet if we find it.

158
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,249
- If?
- When.

159
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:05,749
When.

160
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:16,149
Hey, we should get going.

161
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,309
- What is it?
- Nothing.

162
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,719
If we don't come back,

163
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,039
I want you to know that you
have been a real friend, R-2.

164
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,319
My best one, in fact.

165
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:38,149
there's so much I want to tell you.

166
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:44,349
Tell me when you get back.

167
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,589
Ray, never be
afraid of who you are.

168
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:26,739
We have a spy in our ranks,

169
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,229
who just sent a message
to the resistance.

170
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:34,629
Whoever this traitor is
won't stop us.

171
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:37,529
with what I've seen at EXEGOL,

172
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:40,779
The first order is about
to become a true empire.

173
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:48,899
I sense unease about
my appearance, General Hux.

174
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,519
about the mask? No sir.

175
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,129
- well done.
- I like it.

176
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:01,469
forgive me, sir,
but these allies on EXEGOL

177
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:04,699
these are like a cult,
despite their number.

178
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:07,099
There are countless
legions of star destroyers,

179
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,949
The Sith fleet will increase
our resources 10,000 fold.

180
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:15,009
such range and power will correct
the error of star killer in piece.

181
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:18,699
We will immediately alert, and gather
more new people from the galaxy.

182
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,679
this fleet, what is it a gift?
there's not..

183
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,829
What is he askin for in return?

184
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:29,689
Prepare to crush any world that defy us.

185
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,999
Tonight we'll going
hunting for this trash.

186
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,899
you sure this is it?

187
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:47,829
These are the exact coordinates
that Master Luke left behind.

188
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:58,159
- What is this? - It is the
festival of the Ancestors.

189
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,699
this celebration occurs
only once every 42 years.

190
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:04,469
- well that's lucky.
- lucky indeed.

191
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:09,189
This festival is known for its colorful
raspberries and delicious sweets.

192
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,699
I've never seen anything like this.

193
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,759
You won't even see it, so see your way.

194
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:38,109
there's always random first order
patrols in crowds like these.

195
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:41,379
so keep your heads down, Chewie.

196
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,319
- Let's spread up,
- see what the locals know.

197
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,289
she said welcome!

198
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:25,309
- Her name is Nyambee Geema.
- That's an excellent name, I'm Rey.

199
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:31,389
she would be honored to know
your family name too.

200
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:36,889
I don't have one, I'm just Rey.

201
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:58,029
Palpatine wants you dead.

202
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,989
- serving another master?
- No.

203
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,419
I have other plans.

204
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,379
while I offered you my hand once,
you didn't want to take it.

205
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,019
Why didn't you?

206
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,689
You could kill me. Why didn't you?

207
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,079
You can't hide Rey, not from me.

208
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:26,079
I see you through the cracks in your
mask, you are haunted.

209
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:29,769
You can't stop seeing what
you did to your father.

210
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:34,439
Do you still count the days
that your parents left?

211
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,689
Such pain in you, such anger.

212
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,909
I don't wanna have to kill you.

213
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:46,269
I'm going to find you and I'm
gonna turn you to the dark side,

214
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,179
when I offer you my hand again.

215
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:53,929
- You'll take it?
- We'll see.

216
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,309
We have to go back to "Falcon".
Now!

217
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,009
- Why?
- It's Ren!

218
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,049
Sir, we have this analyzed.

219
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:11,809
It comes from the Middian system.
Pasaana, The Forbidden Valley.

220
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,219
Prepare my ship.

221
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:17,899
- allow the local troops, send a division.
- Yes, supreme leader.

222
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:25,059
fleet force! hold it right there!
I locked at resistance fugitives.

223
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:33,739
Follow me.

224
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,429
Leia sent me a transmission.

225
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,229
How did you find us?

226
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,449
Wookie's standing on the crowd.

227
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,299
good to see you too, old buddy.

228
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:04,649
- This is General Lando Calrissian.
- You know who he is, C-3PO.

229
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:06,399
It is an honor, General.

230
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:09,579
General Calrissian, we are
looking for EXEGOL.

231
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,309
of course you are.

232
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:18,829
- Only two were made.
- this is way finder?

233
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:21,059
Lukes gang came here to find one.

234
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,129
I know, I was with him.

235
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,139
Luke and I were old jedi hunter,

236
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,499
Ochio Bestuon

237
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:33,339
he was carrying a clue that
could lead to a way finder.

238
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,339
we followed his ship halfway
across the galaxy, here.

239
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,539
When we got to his ship, it was
abandoned. No clue, no way finder.

240
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:42,859
Is Ochi's ship still here?

241
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,809
It's in the desert, where he left it.

242
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:48,549
We need to get to that ship,
search it again.

243
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,249
I got a bad feeling about this.

244
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:01,099
Ochio's ship is out Lost
Canyon, go.

245
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:02,799
Thank you, General.

246
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:04,739
you too, Chewie.

247
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:06,529
Leia needs pilots, General.

248
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:11,739
My flying days are long gone,
but do me a favor.

249
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,999
- Give Leia my love.
- You should give it to her yourself.

250
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:19,139
Thank you.

251
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:28,919
There, an accelerator!

252
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,999
How do you know how to do that?

253
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,999
no need to worry,
all are vagrant.

254
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,799
We gotta go.

255
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:53,459
We spotted the fugitives.

256
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:16,509
-Hey, they're flying now!
- they're filying now?

257
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,809
they're flying now!

258
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,889
- did we lose them. - looks like it.
- Excellent job, sir.

259
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,989
terrible job, sir.

260
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,279
Not now, BB-8!

261
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:12,559
Never underestimate a droid.

262
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,279
hold!

263
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:54,879
Ochi's ship

264
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:58,939
I have seen that ship before.

265
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:00,139
Rey, they're getting...

266
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,899
What the hell is this?

267
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:28,699
digging field,
try to grab something.

268
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:31,879
come on!

269
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,949
- BB-8, no!
- Ray! Rey!

270
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:39,189
- Rey, I never told you...
- What? Finn?

271
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:54,479
General, we are getting a reports of
an raid in festival of ancestors.

272
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:59,489
This mission is everything. we can not fail.
any words from Ray?

273
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:02,729
- "The Falcon" is not responding.
- Do you have to say like that?

274
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,439
- like what?
- Do me a personal favor, be optimistic.

275
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,059
Yes, ma'am, this is terrific.

276
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:12,829
You are not gonna believe how well
this is gonna trap, it will be great...

277
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,809
Rey!  Finn!

278
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:25,899
you didn't say my name, sir,
but I'm alright.

279
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,929
- You are alright? - Yeah.
Where's Finn?

280
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:35,719
Where's Chewie?

281
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:39,300
- I'm good!
- Oh, Mr. Finn?

282
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,300
What is this place?

283
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,200
Isn't it after life? is it?
Are droids allowed in it?

284
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:47,269
- Don't worry - might still be.
- which way out?

285
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,119
We have to hurry.

286
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:57,159
- so, what was it?
- What?

287
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,859
- What you were gonna tell me?
- when?

288
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:02,269
when you were sinking into the sand,
you say "I never told you..."

289
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,369
I'll tell you later.

290
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:06,169
you mean, when Poe's not here?

291
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,589
we were dying in the sand
while keeping secrets?

292
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:13,409
I'll tell you when you tell us
about all that shifty stuff you do.

293
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:15,999
you'll not wanna know
what made these tunnels.

294
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:20,829
- Judging by this conference of the tunnel
walls... - I said we're not wanna know. Not!

295
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,449
- What's that?
- It's a speeder.

296
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:24,649
an old one.

297
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:30,339
- perhaps we will find the driver.
- Yeah BB-8 I think that too.

298
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,999
The standard emblem in the Sith system.

299
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:37,539
- Sith.
- this was Ochi's.

300
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:40,939
Look sensitive.
Ochi never left this place.

301
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:44,059
- and he ended up down here.
- he was heading for his ship.

302
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,779
same thing happened to us,
happened to him.

303
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:46,979
So how did Oechi get out?

304
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:49,209
He didn't.

305
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:53,579
No, he didn't.

306
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,300
- Bones.
- I don't like bones.

307
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:59,219
bones? never a good sign.

308
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:02,909
Yeah I see it.

309
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,409
horrible things...

310
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,589
what happened with this...

311
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,029
- There's writing on them.
- perhaps I can translate.

312
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,949
The location of the way finder
has been inscribed on this dagger.

313
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:30,589
It's the clue that
Master Luke was looking for.

314
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:32,499
and, where is way finder?

315
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:35,439
I am afraid I can not tell you.

316
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,559
you know 24 languages
you can't read that?

317
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:42,549
I have read it, sir.
I know exactly where the way finder is.

318
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:47,539
- Unfortunately it is written in the ruling
language of the Sith. - so what?

319
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,299
my programming forbids
me from translating it.

320
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:52,559
So you're telling us the one time
We need you to talk, you can't?

321
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:54,489
Irony, sir.

322
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,299
I am mechanically incapable
of speaking translation from Sith.

323
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:01,439
I believe the rule has been
set by the Senate...

324
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:07,239
Save us!

325
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,319
Finish.

326
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:50,969
- I'll blast it .
- Don't blast it.

327
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:51,549
I carry some vital energy from
power, from me to him.

328
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:53,700
And would have done the same.

329
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:17,300
It is impossible to walk
with this shipwreck.

330
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:18,779
You gotta keep moving.

331
00:36:18,979 --> 00:36:20,879
Find someone who will translate
the inscription into that dagger.

332
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,389
A more helpful droid.

333
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:25,219
I suggest you go back to a
group of "Millennium Falcon".

334
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:28,289
Yes, they're waiting for us at the
falcon. - yeah, in the pits of Greek.

335
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:31,079
And they'll use you as a target droid.

336
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:34,849
You both make excellent observations.

337
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,249
What is it?

338
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,539
I'll be right behind you, it's okay.

339
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:54,819
see what we got!

340
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:59,009
See if the inverter starts.

341
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,949
Is it at full capacity?

342
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:09,949
look at that!

343
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,239
Where is she?

344
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:18,539
Finn, help me out of here.

345
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,609
Chewie, tell Rey,
we gotta go.

346
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,199
- What is she doing?
- Where the hell is Chewie?

347
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,739
It's Ren!

348
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,179
- Go up!
- Move!

349
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:55,589
Rey!  Rey!

350
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,179
They got Chewie, they got him!

351
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,179
- Chewie!
- No!

352
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,759
We gotta go, they're coming!

353
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:22,569
Ray, come on!

354
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,789
Rey!

355
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:30,069
- We gotta go! Rey!
- Chewie!

356
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:33,759
- Ray, come on!

357
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:55,059
I lost control.

358
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:58,529
- It wasn't your fault.
- it was.

359
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:02,929
- No, it was Ren, he made you...
- Chewie's gone!

360
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:07,839
The power came from me,
Finn there were things don't know.

361
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:10,759
Then tell me.

362
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,909
I had a vision...

363
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:24,329
of the throne of the Sith,

364
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:29,549
- And who was on it.
- Ren!

365
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:33,319
And me.

366
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:51,189
We recoverd the scavenge's
ship, but she got away.

367
00:42:51,389 --> 00:42:54,129
under command of the Knights of Ren
we suffered losses,

368
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:56,979
the transport was destroyed...
- senior report

369
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:00,179
- general...
- No believe in general.

370
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:03,429
There was another transport in the desert.

371
00:43:03,629 --> 00:43:07,429
it brought back a valuable prisoner.

372
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:09,549
prisoner?

373
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,079
The beast used to fly with Han Solo.

374
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:23,089
- Take him to the integration six.
- Move it!

375
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,819
We only got 8 hours left,
so what we're gonna do?

376
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:27,619
What can we do?
we gotta go back to base.

377
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:29,699
We don't have time to go
back, we are not giving up.

378
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,559
If we do that,
Chewie died for nothing.

379
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:33,899
- Chewie had the dagger.
- well, we do find another way.

380
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:36,789
There isn't. that was the only clue
to the way finder thing and its gone.

381
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,659
so true, inscription lives only
in my memory, now.

382
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:43,729
hold on.

383
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:47,229
the inscription that was on the
dagger is in your memory?

384
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:48,559
Yes, Master Poe.

385
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:52,139
But the translation from a forbidden
language can not be retreat.

386
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,839
that is short of a complete
protective memory bypass.

387
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,459
A complete what?

388
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,099
it's terribly dangerous and
simple act of foe.

389
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:00,919
was done without the will of the
droids, by criminals.

390
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,269
Let's do that.

391
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:05,049
- I know a black market droids man.
- black market droids?

392
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:06,979
- But it's in Kijimi.
- What wrong with Kijimi?

393
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:09,879
I had a little bad luck in Kijimi.

394
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,349
But if this mission fails,
it's all for nothing.

395
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:16,659
All we've done all this time.

396
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:22,889
We're all in this, to the end.

397
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:30,009
For Chewie.

398
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,209
shake hands.

399
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:34,659
For Chewie!

400
00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:40,759
to Kijimi.

401
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:16,279
battery encharged.

402
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,279
Hello!

403
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:24,139
Hello.

404
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:27,669
- Hello.
- No thank you.

405
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:31,289
looks have someone treated him badly.

406
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:35,649
It's alright, you are with us now.

407
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,649
Open up!

408
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:23,300
you! come here!
Show me your identification!

409
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,669
they're everywhere.

410
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:31,339
alright, I know what we should do.

411
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,099
- so do I, we should leave.
- calm it, C-3PO.

412
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:35,849
Follow me.

413
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,559
alright, let's go down...

414
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:49,929
I heard you were spotted
the monks cave,

415
00:46:50,129 --> 00:46:53,779
he's not stupid enough to come
back here. - You'll be surprised.

416
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,079
- Who is this?
- What's going on?

417
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,839
guys, this is zori
zori, this is Rey and Finn...

418
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,949
I can pull this
trigger right now.

419
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,099
- I've seen you do worse...
- Try it and it will be the last time.

420
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:03,659
We can talk about this.

421
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:06,769
- I want to see your brains in the snow.
- Are you still mad?

422
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:08,599
Zori, we can use your help,

423
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,809
we need to quickly break
the head for this droid.

424
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:12,669
- Sorry? - We're trying
to find Babu Frick.

425
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:15,279
Babu?  Babu only works for
the crew, that's not you any more.

426
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:16,779
What crew?

427
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:18,289
how funny you never mentioned it.

428
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:21,079
Your friend's old job
was running spies.

429
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:22,779
- You were a spies rider?
- you were a storm trooper?

430
00:47:23,029 --> 00:47:25,079
- were you a spies runner?
- were you scavenger?

431
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:27,089
- We can do this all night.
- You don't have all night.

432
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:29,719
You know, I'm still digging
out of the hole you me in

433
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:32,219
when you left to join the resistance.

434
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:35,019
You? You're the one we were looking for.

435
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,629
bounty for her just may cover us.

436
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:50,079
we could really use your help, please.

437
00:47:50,939 --> 00:47:56,309
nothing you care,
but I think you're okay.

438
00:47:56,529 --> 00:47:58,779
I care.

439
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:09,629
Patrols, stay close by.

440
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:13,079
Who would have thought,
the mediators of the grass.

441
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:15,529
- runner of spies.
- alright...

442
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:17,279
come on 3PO.

443
00:48:49,879 --> 00:48:53,309
I have no idea why
I agreed to this.

444
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:55,509
I must be mulfunctioning.

445
00:48:57,429 --> 00:49:00,509
Babu Frick,
can you help us with this?

446
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:08,849
Zori, is this gonna work?

447
00:49:14,469 --> 00:49:17,389
He says he's found something in
the droid's forbidden memory back.

448
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:21,039
- words translated from Sith?
- Yes, that's what we need.

449
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:24,019
who are you hanging out
who speak Sith?

450
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:26,159
Can you make him translate?

451
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,339
Bamboo, can you make him translate it?

452
00:49:31,779 --> 00:49:35,149
Yes, but it will cause a
completely memory.. wipe.

453
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:39,079
Wait, if we make him translate it,
he won't remember anything.

454
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:46,259
- There must be some other way.
- doesn't R2 back up your memory?

455
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:49,729
please! R2's stores units
are famously unreliable.

456
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:52,639
You know what's the best,
more than any of us.

457
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:55,519
Do we have a choice?

458
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,679
If this mission fails,

459
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:05,829
it was all for nothing.

460
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:10,479
all we've done, all this time.

461
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:18,149
What are you doing there, 3PO?

462
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:24,219
taking one last look, sir,
at my friends.

463
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,869
sad!

464
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:33,869
The night raids gonna start soon.

465
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:35,899
- I'll keep look out.
- I'm coming with you.

466
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:40,209
- You still don't trust me, huh?
- You ever trust me? - Nope.

467
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:47,639
Report, General Pryde.

468
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,229
there has been development, sir.

469
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:52,879
the night raiders tracked the scavenger
- to a settlement called Kijimi.

470
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:56,859
shall we destroy the city?

471
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:06,649
I just had an idea
something else we could try.

472
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,449
how long's it been like this?

473
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:24,509
1st order must take
them a long time ago.

474
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:26,839
I can't stop anymore.

475
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:29,009
I saved enough to get out.

476
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:30,939
I'm going to the colonies.

477
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:34,009
- How? all roads are blocked.

478
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:39,549
that's 1st order Captain's metal.

479
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,300
I've never seen a real one.

480
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,649
Free passage through any blockade,

481
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:45,829
landing privileges any vessel.

482
00:51:54,169 --> 00:51:56,049
wanna come with me?

483
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:07,959
I can't walk out of this war.
not until it's over...

484
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,759
Maybe it is

485
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:15,019
we sent a call for help
in the battle of Crait.

486
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:17,949
Nobody came.

487
00:52:18,689 --> 00:52:21,429
everyone are so afraid.

488
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:25,199
they've given up.

489
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:29,689
Nah, I don't believe you believe that.

490
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,639
They win by making you
think you're alone.

491
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,179
remember?

492
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:44,209
there is more of us.

493
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,949
squeaky wheels,
- I have squeaky a wheel.

494
00:52:56,229 --> 00:53:01,789
swing eliminated, thank you,
very kind...

495
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:11,289
Something is not right about those.

496
00:53:12,449 --> 00:53:16,129
I know where I've seen it,
ship was on Ochi's ship.

497
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:19,839
- What?
- The day my parents left.

498
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,459
they were on that ship.

499
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:24,309
Are you sure?

500
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:26,759
There's an incoming destroyer.

501
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:28,139
We gotta go now,
did we get it?

502
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:31,879
- Babu?
- Yup, droid is ready.

503
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:39,759
The Emperor's way finder
is in the imperial vault.

504
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:43,559
In Delta 36, transient
936, corridor 32,

505
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:45,829
on a moonenly Endor system,

506
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,549
the entrance from the south,
as shown on the screen.

507
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:51,929
... appears on the screen.

508
00:53:56,409 --> 00:53:59,159
The endor system,
where the last war in?

509
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:13,369
- Ren's destroyer.
- Is here?

510
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:19,409
Chewie?

511
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:22,009
What about him?

512
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:27,049
- He's on Ren ship, he's alive.
- What? How?

513
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:29,459
He's alive, he must have
been on another transport.

514
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:31,959
- We gotta go get him.
- Your friend's on that sky trash?

515
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:33,659
I guess he is.

516
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:37,819
Let me introduce myself,
I'm C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

517
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:40,639
- And you are?
- Okay, that's gonna be a problem.

518
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:44,569
- Hello, I'm Babu Frick.
- well, hello!

519
00:54:51,879 --> 00:54:54,959
3PO move your metal ass,
we're almost there.

520
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:56,879
How dare you, we just met.

521
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:59,919
Poe, you can go on Capital ship.

522
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,809
Go help your friend.

523
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:04,919
Zori, I don't think I can take this.

524
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,139
I don't care what you think.

525
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,979
- We have to go, now.
- Come with us.

526
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:16,149
- Poe! - Can I kiss you?
- Go!

527
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:25,779
What is that? stop him!

528
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:44,469
The situation is good.
clear entrance in the hanger 12.

529
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:46,509
come on, Chewie, we're coming.

530
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:50,199
Who ever this Chewie person is,
this is madness...

531
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,849
You three stay there.

532
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:11,619
- which way?
- I have no idea, follow me.

533
00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:36,019
- drop your weapons.
- It's okay that we're here.

534
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:39,949
- It's okay that you're here,
- it's good!

535
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:42,879
- You're relieved that we're here!
- thank goodness you're here!

536
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:44,939
- Welcome, guys.
- Did she that to us?

537
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:47,269
We are looking for a prisoner
and his belongings.

538
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:51,085
the cameras!

539
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:56,869
They said Chewie's this way.

540
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:10,279
- Ray, come on.
- The dagger is on the ship, we need it.

541
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:13,279
Why?

542
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:14,539
a feeling.

543
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:17,449
- I'll meet you back in the hangar.
- Rey, you can't...

544
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:19,199
Chewie.

545
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:27,099
search the city again.

546
00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:31,069
she's close.

547
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:35,889
Of course we came
for you, Chewie.

548
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:40,339
Rey is here, she's gonna
get the dagger.

549
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:47,080
whose ship is this?

550
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,589
ship's this way, follow me.

551
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:51,599
over here!

552
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:54,209
wrong way!

553
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:56,189
Not really right, where is it?

554
00:58:24,089 --> 00:58:26,009
- We are close?
- come here!

555
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:35,289
Poe!

556
00:58:37,749 --> 00:58:41,229
- You are OK?
- Nope!

557
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:43,499
You there, hands up!

558
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:48,079
drop your weapons, now!
put your weapons down! drop them!

559
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,809
drop them now!

560
00:58:52,169 --> 00:58:55,359
- Hey, fellas.
- Shut up, scum!

561
00:59:39,819 --> 00:59:41,089
Rey!

562
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:47,559
Wherever you are,
you aren't hard to find.

563
00:59:47,859 --> 00:59:49,239
you're hard to get rid of.

564
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:54,499
I pushed them into the desert
because I needed to see you.

565
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:57,879
I needed you to see...

566
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,109
Who you are...

567
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:03,379
I know the rest of your story.

568
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:09,039
- Rey!
- You are lying!

569
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:11,299
I never lied to you.

570
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:13,999
Your parents were no one.

571
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,509
They chose to be,

572
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:19,689
- To keep you safe.
- Don't!

573
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:21,579
You remember more than you say.

574
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,829
- I've been in your head.
- I do not want this!

575
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:26,819
- Search your memories.
- stop!

576
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:33,179
Remember them, see them.

577
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:44,679
You'll be safe here, I promise.

578
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:58,359
- They sold you to protect you.
- stop talking.

579
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,749
Rey, I know what happened to them.

580
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:14,819
major general, the scavengers
not with them.

581
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:18,029
Take them, terminate them.

582
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:28,159
Tell me where you are,
you don't know the whole story.

583
01:01:30,349 --> 01:01:34,329
It was Palpatine who had
your parents taken.

584
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:37,109
he was looking for you,

585
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:40,089
but they wouldn't say where you were.

586
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:43,259
So he gave you the order.

587
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:49,629
she's an old Jakku, she has gone...

588
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:06,689
So that's where you are.

589
01:02:10,419 --> 01:02:13,089
you know why the Emperor
always wanted you dead?

590
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,209
- No.
- I can tell you.

591
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:26,639
she was in my quarters,
lock down the ship!

592
01:02:28,969 --> 01:02:33,269
actually, I like to do this myself.

593
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:39,969
What we're gonna tell to Rey?

594
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:41,779
still on that?

595
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:43,279
I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

596
01:02:43,529 --> 01:02:45,279
Yeah, that's it.

597
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:49,529
It would be better not to be late.
That would be a bad time...

598
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:57,379
- I'm the spy. - what?
- You?

599
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,149
We don't have much time.

600
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:01,300
- I knew it.
- No, you did not.

601
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,559
What is your operating number?

602
01:03:03,809 --> 01:03:05,799
That is not even a language.

603
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:13,189
Where are the others?

604
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,779
They haven't come back.

605
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:23,319
Find them, go.

606
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:30,799
- friends, ahead.
- yes, there they are!

607
01:03:30,859 --> 01:03:33,849
- BB-8 come on! - I stopped
the shield, We got seconds.

608
01:03:34,049 --> 01:03:36,709
there she is. she's a survivor.

609
01:03:37,429 --> 01:03:40,209
Wait, blast me in the arm, quick!

610
01:03:40,409 --> 01:03:42,509
- What?
- you don't know.

611
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:48,119
Why are you helping us?

612
01:03:48,509 --> 01:03:50,569
I don't care if you win,

613
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:54,509
I need Kylo Ren to lose.

614
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:21,299
Why did the Emperor come for me?

615
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:24,199
Why did he want to kill a child?

616
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:29,199
- Tell me.
- Because he saw what you would become.

617
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:31,849
he has little power.

618
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:37,319
You have his power,
you're his granddaughter.

619
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:41,929
You are a Palpatine.

620
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:52,049
My mother was the daughter of the raider.

621
01:04:52,249 --> 01:04:55,209
Your father was the son of the emperor.

622
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:59,809
What Palpatine doesn't know is
we were a DieAt in the force way.

623
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:02,699
Two little one.

624
01:05:09,419 --> 01:05:13,079
We'll kill him together,

625
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:15,629
and take the throne.

626
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,079
You know what you need to do.

627
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:28,009
You know.

628
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:38,009
I do.

629
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,549
Hold steady.

630
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:52,789
Finn, move fast.

631
01:05:54,129 --> 01:05:57,069
Ray, come on!

632
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,129
It was a coordinated
incursion, legion General.

633
01:06:14,459 --> 01:06:18,159
They overpower the guards and
forced me to take them to their ship.

634
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:19,829
I see.

635
01:06:20,029 --> 01:06:24,829
- Give me the supreme leader.
- Yes sir.

636
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:29,079
Tell him we found our spy.

637
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:34,769
I don't know why they're not
following us, but I don't trust it.

638
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:38,599
landing gears busted?
How busted?

639
01:06:39,379 --> 01:06:41,849
we need to find the
way finder, finding EXEGOL.

640
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:45,279
That's what we're doing.

641
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:53,809
He killed my mother
and my father.

642
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,319
I'm going to find Palpatine,

643
01:06:58,979 --> 01:07:01,799
and destroy him.

644
01:07:02,529 --> 01:07:05,469
Ray, that doesn't sound like you.

645
01:07:07,999 --> 01:07:11,619
- Rey, I know you.
- People keep telling they know me.

646
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:15,549
I'm afraid no one does.

647
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:23,839
The Jedi student still lives.

648
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:28,399
perhaps you have betrayed me.

649
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:33,019
Do not make me turn
my fleet against you.

650
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:36,309
I know where she is going.
she will never be a jedi.

651
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:39,899
make sure of it. Kill her!

652
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:28,029
- What is that?
- It's Pedestra, a bad place, of an old war.

653
01:08:28,389 --> 01:08:32,439
It will take us years to
find what we are looking for.

654
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,119
only display tells.

655
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:10,489
way finder is there.

656
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:13,089
heads up.

657
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,289
- rough landing.
- I've seen worse.

658
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:23,619
- I've seen better.

659
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:28,009
- Are you resistance?
- that depends.

660
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:31,199
we picked up a transmission
from some one named Babu Frick.

661
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:34,569
Babu Frick, oh, he's one
of my oldest friends.

662
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:37,869
He said you'd come,
he said you were the last hope.

663
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:43,300
We have to get to that wreck,
there's something inside that we need.

664
01:09:43,519 --> 01:09:45,059
I can take you there by water.

665
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:47,989
- You see the water?
- Not now, too dangerous.

666
01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:52,519
- Let's leave it for tomorrow. - We
can't wait that long, we don't have the time.

667
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:54,809
where is the choice.

668
01:09:55,059 --> 01:09:59,089
- let's get that ship fixed,
do you have spare parts? - Some.

669
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:01,519
- I'm Jannah.
- Poe.

670
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,629
step back.

671
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:21,039
What a cracked situation.
Is every day like this for you people?

672
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:24,759
- madness.
- The solution is to maintain control.

673
01:10:25,089 --> 01:10:28,569
- isn't 06, but should work.
- Thank you.

674
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:33,959
- this is a 1st order part.
- there's an old cruise on the west ridge.

675
01:10:34,309 --> 01:10:36,299
stripped for parts.

676
01:10:36,689 --> 01:10:39,999
the one we were assigned 
the one we escaped.

677
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:43,719
Okay, wait. you were 1st order?

678
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:45,399
Not by choice.

679
01:10:47,809 --> 01:10:50,899
We were united  for a while, all of us.

680
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:53,659
I was TZ-1719, storm trooper.

681
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:56,799
FN 2187

682
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:58,749
- You?
- I never knew there were more.

683
01:10:59,049 --> 01:11:02,419
Fuckers.
All of us here were storm troopers.

684
01:11:02,619 --> 01:11:04,789
We were during
the battle of Ensa island.

685
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:07,319
they told us to fire civilians.

686
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:08,939
We didn't do it.

687
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,300
We laid our weapons down.

688
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:12,539
- all of you?
- The whole company.

689
01:11:14,129 --> 01:11:17,089
I don't even know how it happened.

690
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:21,609
- It wasn't a decision, but more like...
- An instinct...

691
01:11:21,809 --> 01:11:25,829
- Feeling...
- A feeling...

692
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:28,159
The force.

693
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:34,049
the force brought me here,
brought me to Rey and Poe.

694
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:37,359
You say that like
you're sure it's real.

695
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,800
It's real.

696
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,659
I wasn't sure then, but...

697
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:46,619
I am now.

698
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:47,819
what is it buddy?

699
01:11:50,059 --> 01:11:51,619
what do you mean I haven't seen her?

700
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:08,999
she has a skimmer?

701
01:12:43,499 --> 01:12:45,459
What the hell she was thinking?

702
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:46,550
We gotta go after her.

703
01:12:46,806 --> 01:12:48,550
We'll get the Falcon fixed and
get out there as fast as we can

704
01:12:48,809 --> 01:12:49,809
No, we'll lose her.

705
01:12:50,059 --> 01:12:51,800
look she left us, what
do you wanna do, swim?

706
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,259
she's not herself, you have no
idea what she was fighting.

707
01:12:54,459 --> 01:12:59,259
- And you do?
- Yeah I do.

708
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:02,159
and so does Leia.

709
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:07,159
- I'm not Leia.
- that's the damn shore.

710
01:13:28,899 --> 01:13:31,000
Finn.

711
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,269
There is no other skimmer.

712
01:16:22,629 --> 01:16:25,039
Don't be afraid of who you are.

713
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:01,189
Look at yourself.

714
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:04,300
You wanted to prove to my
mother that you're a Jedi,

715
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:06,329
but you've proved something else.

716
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:11,619
You can't go back to her now.

717
01:17:12,959 --> 01:17:15,439
Like I can't.

718
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:19,359
Give it to me.

719
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:24,549
The dark side is in our nature.

720
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:29,519
You're so into it.

721
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:33,359
Give it to me.

722
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:43,409
The only way you can get
to EXEGOL is with me.

723
01:18:18,649 --> 01:18:21,636
Leia knows what must be done, R2.

724
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:28,299
To reach her son now,
she'll take all the strength she has left.

725
01:19:29,989 --> 01:19:31,489
No, you can't go there.

726
01:19:31,689 --> 01:19:33,899
- I can't leave her.
- We can't.

727
01:19:34,099 --> 01:19:35,979
Rey!

728
01:21:13,339 --> 01:21:15,089
Ben!

729
01:21:45,499 --> 01:21:46,779
Leia!

730
01:23:04,829 --> 01:23:07,069
I did want to take your hand,

731
01:23:08,569 --> 01:23:10,199
Ben's hand.

732
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:55,249
Goodbye, dear princess.

733
01:24:06,919 --> 01:24:09,199
Poe, something's happened.

734
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:12,180
Can't wait, we gotta see General.

735
01:24:14,789 --> 01:24:16,629
she's gone.

736
01:24:48,269 --> 01:24:50,039
hey kid!

737
01:25:10,699 --> 01:25:13,149
I miss you, son.

738
01:25:14,839 --> 01:25:17,289
Your son is dead.

739
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:18,619
No.

740
01:25:23,699 --> 01:25:26,499
Kylo Ren is dead.

741
01:25:28,209 --> 01:25:30,359
My son is alive.

742
01:25:34,409 --> 01:25:36,949
You're just a memory.

743
01:25:38,379 --> 01:25:41,199
Your memory.

744
01:25:44,509 --> 01:25:45,849
Come home.

745
01:25:47,099 --> 01:25:48,769
It's too late.

746
01:25:51,569 --> 01:25:54,159
she's gone.

747
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:56,539
Your mother is gone.

748
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:00,889
But what she stood for,
what she fought for,

749
01:26:01,549 --> 01:26:04,119
has not gone.

750
01:26:10,449 --> 01:26:11,959
Ben...

751
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:16,459
I know what I have to do, but I don't
know if I have strength to do it.

752
01:26:26,009 --> 01:26:27,579
You do.

753
01:26:38,589 --> 01:26:40,509
dad...

754
01:26:45,309 --> 01:26:47,289
I know.

755
01:27:07,869 --> 01:27:12,049
The Princess of the Older Ren
has disrupted my plan,

756
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,579
but her foolish act will be in vain.

757
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:21,109
come to me on EXEGOL, General Pryde.

758
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:26,979
As I served you in the old wars,
I serve you now.

759
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:31,679
Send a ship to the world, I know.

760
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:33,719
let it burn.

761
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:36,599
The  final order begins

762
01:27:36,799 --> 01:27:41,109
she will come, her friends will follow.

763
01:27:41,229 --> 01:27:42,739
Yes my lord.

764
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:58,549
Captain!

765
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:02,469
- Kijimi is in range.
- Fire!

766
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:23,929
Kijima? How?

767
01:28:24,529 --> 01:28:26,849
A blast from Star Destroyer.

768
01:28:27,729 --> 01:28:31,059
A ship from the new Sith fleet
out of the unknowns.

769
01:28:31,659 --> 01:28:35,279
The emperor sent a ship from EXEGOL.
does that mean every ship in the fleet...

770
01:28:35,529 --> 01:28:37,809
has plan to kill everything in his path.

771
01:28:38,289 --> 01:28:42,809
All of them. this is how it finishes.
- listen!

772
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:46,019
It is on every frequencies.

773
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:48,539
The resistance is dead.

774
01:28:49,379 --> 01:28:52,059
the Sith's final burning.

775
01:28:52,569 --> 01:28:55,249
The whole world surrounder or die.

776
01:28:55,449 --> 01:28:58,129
The final order begins.

777
01:28:58,329 --> 01:29:02,679
Leia made you acting general,
what now?

778
01:29:11,209 --> 01:29:14,079
I gotta tell you, I don't really know..

779
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:19,279
how to do this, what you did.

780
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:23,109
I'm not ready.

781
01:29:23,569 --> 01:29:25,869
neither were we.

782
01:29:28,919 --> 01:29:31,929
Luke, Han, Leia, me...

783
01:29:32,129 --> 01:29:33,979
Who has been ready?

784
01:29:34,179 --> 01:29:36,179
How did you do it?

785
01:29:36,529 --> 01:29:40,039
defeating the empire with almost nothing.

786
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:42,500
We had each other.

787
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,389
That's how we won.

788
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:50,799
- Don't touch that, that's my friend.
- So sorry.

789
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:55,219
- she is gone? - Yeah, she's
gone, I don't know where.

790
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:59,509
- I miss her.
- I miss her too.

791
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:02,799
So what is your name?

792
01:30:03,099 --> 01:30:04,399
I gotta talk to you about...

793
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:05,550
I gotta talk to you about something...

794
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,219
I can't do this alone.

795
01:30:07,429 --> 01:30:08,719
I need you in command with me.

796
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:10,619
- This droid has...
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

797
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:12,069
- General!
- General!

798
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:14,569
this droid has a
ton of information about EXEGOL...

799
01:30:14,769 --> 01:30:15,439
wait, conical face?

800
01:30:15,639 --> 01:30:17,329
- I'm Deo
- Sorry, Deo.

801
01:30:17,529 --> 01:30:19,529
She was going to EXEGOL with
Ociho all these years.

802
01:30:19,779 --> 01:30:21,079
Why was Ochi going there?

803
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:25,319
to bring a little girl he was supposed
to take from Jakku to the emperor.

804
01:30:25,519 --> 01:30:27,509
He wanted her alive.

805
01:31:17,179 --> 01:31:20,999
Jedi weapons deserve more respect.

806
01:31:22,369 --> 01:31:24,959
Master Skywalker!

807
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:30,319
- What are you doing?
- I saw myself on the dark front.

808
01:31:30,519 --> 01:31:32,059
I won't let it happen.

809
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,189
I'm never leaving this
place, I'm doing what you did.

810
01:31:35,629 --> 01:31:37,859
I was wrong.

811
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:41,839
It was fear that kept me here.

812
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:44,799
What are you most afraid of?

813
01:31:48,519 --> 01:31:50,549
myself.

814
01:31:53,069 --> 01:31:54,909
Because you're a Palpatine.

815
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:59,079
Leia knew it too.

816
01:31:59,849 --> 01:32:02,389
She didn't tell me.

817
01:32:08,659 --> 01:32:10,829
She still trained me.

818
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,839
Because you saw your spirit,
your heart.

819
01:32:18,289 --> 01:32:20,289
Rey.

820
01:32:21,029 --> 01:32:24,329
something is stronger than blood.

821
01:32:24,569 --> 01:32:27,999
confronting fear is the
destiniy of the Jedi.

822
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:31,809
your destiny.
If you don't treat Palpatine,

823
01:32:32,009 --> 01:32:34,459
It will mean the end of the Jedi.

824
01:32:35,699 --> 01:32:38,289
And the world will be lost.

825
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:44,019
It's something my sister
want you to have...

826
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:02,069
Leia sword.

827
01:33:03,349 --> 01:33:06,999
It was the last night of our training.

828
01:33:22,809 --> 01:33:29,179
Leia told me that  she had sensed death
of her son at the end of the Jedi path.

829
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:33,169
She sorroundered her saver
to me and said, one day,

830
01:33:33,369 --> 01:33:35,300
It would be picked up again,

831
01:33:35,508 --> 01:33:38,609
by someone who would
finish her journey.

832
01:33:40,219 --> 01:33:44,419
1000 generations live in you now.

833
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:47,909
But this is your fight.

834
01:33:48,109 --> 01:33:51,699
You'll take both swords to EXEGOL.

835
01:33:53,059 --> 01:33:57,449
I can't get there, I don't have
the way finder, I destroyed Ren's ship.

836
01:33:57,629 --> 01:34:00,559
You have everything you need.

837
01:34:09,429 --> 01:34:11,559
Everything I need.

838
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:12,989
Hello, I'm C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

839
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:16,550
- And you are?
- What?

840
01:35:17,509 --> 01:35:22,189
I'm quite certain I would
remember if I had a best friend.

841
01:35:22,869 --> 01:35:25,319
you want to put in my head?

842
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:29,909
Under no circumstance...

843
01:35:30,109 --> 01:35:32,219
Memory restoration complete.

844
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:37,489
R-2, you heard I am going with
Master Rey on her very first mission...

845
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:43,079
I already have?
picking up a signal? from whom?

846
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:51,300
All the information you need
for an air strike on EXEGOL.

847
01:35:51,509 --> 01:35:54,269
- have you seems the more information.
- It's a mess out there.

848
01:35:54,469 --> 01:35:57,549
magnetic cross field.
Gravity wheels, solutions?

849
01:35:57,809 --> 01:36:03,269
- How does fleet take off in there.
- Excuse me, there is something in R2's memory.

850
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:09,239
He says he is receiving a
transmission from Master Luke.

851
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:11,400
that's an old crat ID.

852
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,789
It looks like Skywalkers X-winged ship.

853
01:36:13,989 --> 01:36:17,529
Its transmitting cross signals
on its way to the unknown regions.

854
01:36:17,829 --> 01:36:19,829
It's Rey.

855
01:36:22,929 --> 01:36:25,539
She's going to EXEGOL.

856
01:36:31,459 --> 01:36:33,679
She's showing us how to get there.

857
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:37,069
Then we go together.

858
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:44,939
Come on, buddy, we need you.

859
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:48,589
As long as those star ships are
on EXEGOL, we can hit them.

860
01:36:48,889 --> 01:36:50,100
hit them how?

861
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:53,099
They can't activate their shields
until I they're in atmosphere.

862
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:56,300
which is uneasy on EXEGOL,
ships that size need help taking off.

863
01:36:56,509 --> 01:36:58,059
we can't tell you what's out there.

864
01:36:58,259 --> 01:36:59,549
So how do the ships take off?

865
01:36:59,749 --> 01:37:02,719
They use a signal from a
navigation tower like this one.

866
01:37:03,299 --> 01:37:04,779
except they won't.

867
01:37:05,029 --> 01:37:07,279
Air teams gonna finds the tower,
ground teams gonaa blast it.

868
01:37:07,529 --> 01:37:09,529
- Ground team?
- we have an idea for that.

869
01:37:09,829 --> 01:37:12,779
When the tower's down, the ships will
stuck in the atmosphere for just a minutes.

870
01:37:12,979 --> 01:37:14,769
with no shields and no way out.

871
01:37:14,969 --> 01:37:17,559
We think killing their cannons,
might take light the main reactors.

872
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:19,489
that's our chance.

873
01:37:19,689 --> 01:37:21,819
We need to do some holding
maneuvers are to do real damage.

874
01:37:22,029 --> 01:37:23,579
that maneuver is
one in a million.

875
01:37:23,789 --> 01:37:26,639
Fighters and destroyers can take out
their cannons if there are enough of us.

876
01:37:26,849 --> 01:37:27,859
We're not so many.

877
01:37:28,069 --> 01:37:31,069
He is right,
we'll be no more than bugs for them.

878
01:37:31,269 --> 01:37:35,309
that's why Lando and Chewie will come in.
we'll take the Falcon to the core systems,

879
01:37:35,509 --> 01:37:37,789
to send a call for help
for any body who's listening.

880
01:37:37,989 --> 01:37:41,169
We've got friends out there,
they'll come if know there is hope.

881
01:37:41,999 --> 01:37:43,359
They will.

882
01:37:44,139 --> 01:37:47,309
first order wins by making
us feel that we are alone.

883
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:52,399
We are not alone,
good people will fight if we lead them.

884
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:56,959
Rey had never gave up.

885
01:37:57,529 --> 01:38:00,139
and neither will we.

886
01:38:00,339 --> 01:38:02,819
We're gonna show them we're not afraid.

887
01:38:07,069 --> 01:38:11,719
what our mothers and fathers fought for,
we will not let die.

888
01:38:14,059 --> 01:38:16,019
Not today.

889
01:38:16,559 --> 01:38:18,189
Today we make our last stand.

890
01:38:19,829 --> 01:38:21,129
For the galaxy,

891
01:38:23,299 --> 01:38:25,239
for Leia,

892
01:38:27,449 --> 01:38:29,209
for every one we've lost.

893
01:38:30,549 --> 01:38:32,689
They'd take enough of us,

894
01:38:33,269 --> 01:38:36,339
now we take the war to them.

895
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:06,399
All ships in their seats.

896
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:50,239
Now it's a fough ride.
stay locked on Rey's course.

897
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:00,719
Captain, we have resistance
ships incomeing.

898
01:40:00,919 --> 01:40:03,379
- General!
- Use ion talents.

899
01:40:08,279 --> 01:40:10,029
Look at their fleet!

900
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:17,879
Welcome to EXEGOL!

901
01:40:20,529 --> 01:40:22,779
Could you stop the Sith fleet?

902
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:25,109
Get to their altitude.

903
01:40:25,309 --> 01:40:27,899
They can't fire on us,
without hittng each other.

904
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:31,229
Don't give up, help is coming.

905
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:33,979
there it is, Go.

906
01:40:34,339 --> 01:40:37,549
I see it,
got a vision on tower.

907
01:41:25,399 --> 01:41:27,279
- becoming waves.
- I see them.

908
01:41:27,499 --> 01:41:30,599
I got you, Finn.

909
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:35,439
- Are you ready back there?
- never been ready.

910
01:41:37,339 --> 01:41:38,779
Their targetting navigation tower.

911
01:41:38,979 --> 01:41:40,179
so, the fleet cannot deploy. 

912
01:41:40,388 --> 01:41:41,908
- then we don't use that tower.

913
01:41:42,067 --> 01:41:44,672
switch out our source
of the navigation signal to this ship.

914
01:41:44,909 --> 01:41:47,829
We will guide the fleet ourselves.

915
01:41:52,369 --> 01:41:55,829
- The navigation tower has
been deactivated. - What?

916
01:41:56,029 --> 01:41:58,309
the ships need that signal,
they have to be transported somewhere.

917
01:41:58,559 --> 01:42:02,169
They have figured out what we are
doing, call off the ground invasion.

918
01:42:02,369 --> 01:42:03,869
Wait.

919
01:42:04,609 --> 01:42:08,379
the nav signals coming from that
command ship, that's our drop zone.

920
01:42:08,579 --> 01:42:10,309
How do you know?

921
01:42:11,029 --> 01:42:12,119
a feeling.

922
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:14,809
You wanna launch a ground
invasion on a star destroyer?

923
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:18,049
we can't take off that
ship' nav system from the air.

924
01:42:18,249 --> 01:42:21,029
Give us cover, we gotta keep
that fleet until help arrives.

925
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:23,349
We hope.

926
01:42:23,469 --> 01:42:27,199
you heard general, all ways.
cover that lander.

927
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:34,779
- They landed a troop carrier.
- Can speed us?

928
01:42:35,029 --> 01:42:37,949
- I can't, sir.
- Why not?

929
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:40,089
They are using our speeders.

930
01:42:45,029 --> 01:42:47,019
How fast you learned a lesson!

931
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:50,799
You have a good teacher.

932
01:43:03,029 --> 01:43:05,599
You are doing great, buddy.
The tower is ahead!

933
01:44:10,559 --> 01:44:14,199
long have I waited,

934
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:27,739
for my grandchild to come home.

935
01:44:29,869 --> 01:44:32,559
I never wanted you dead.

936
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:35,409
I wanted you here,

937
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:39,129
Empress Palpatine.

938
01:44:40,379 --> 01:44:43,129
You will take the throne.

939
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:49,129
It is your birth
right to rule here.

940
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:51,199
It's in your blood.

941
01:44:51,499 --> 01:44:53,519
Our blood.

942
01:44:54,939 --> 01:44:57,159
I haven't come to meet the Sith.

943
01:44:58,219 --> 01:45:01,579
- I've come to win them.
- as a Jedi.

944
01:45:01,809 --> 01:45:04,499
- Yes.
- No!

945
01:45:04,699 --> 01:45:07,969
Your hatred, your anger...

946
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:11,209
You want to kill me.

947
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,969
That is what I want.

948
01:45:15,509 --> 01:45:20,089
kill me and my spirit
will pass to you,

949
01:45:20,619 --> 01:45:23,759
as all the Siths live in me.

950
01:45:24,519 --> 01:45:26,980
You will be an Empress,

951
01:45:27,519 --> 01:45:30,819
we will be one.

952
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:39,899
The situation is explosive,
how do we doing?

953
01:45:40,099 --> 01:45:43,079
- We're gonna blow our way and take
that nav tower. - All explosives are armed.

954
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:46,199
- Come on BB-8, your turn.
- I'm coming in.

955
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:16,389
This will do it.

956
01:46:27,579 --> 01:46:29,729
there it goes!

957
01:46:30,519 --> 01:46:34,029
nice job, Finn, nav signals down,
but not for long.

958
01:46:34,279 --> 01:46:36,029
We're off line, sir.

959
01:46:36,489 --> 01:46:39,699
- Resend the navigation signal.
- on its way, sir.

960
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:43,399
- Finn, let's go.
- Something's missing.

961
01:46:43,599 --> 01:46:45,349
Cannons didn't stop,
they're resetting their systems.

962
01:46:45,469 --> 01:46:48,229
- so?
- I gotta go do something.

963
01:46:48,809 --> 01:46:50,749
I standing with you.

964
01:46:52,429 --> 01:46:54,569
still no Falcon and backup.

965
01:46:55,839 --> 01:46:57,329
I don't know, R2.

966
01:46:57,529 --> 01:46:58,889
Maybe no body else is coming.

967
01:46:59,089 --> 01:47:00,659
What do we do, General?

968
01:47:00,939 --> 01:47:02,369
We gotta hit them ourselves.

969
01:47:02,489 --> 01:47:04,109
what can we do
against these things?

970
01:47:04,229 --> 01:47:05,709
Just stay alive.

971
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:10,446
The time has come.

972
01:47:20,089 --> 01:47:23,039
With your hatred you will take my life.

973
01:47:23,649 --> 01:47:25,580
And you will ascend.

974
01:47:27,469 --> 01:47:31,149
All you wanted for me to hate,
but I won't.

975
01:47:31,529 --> 01:47:32,879
Not even you.

976
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:37,170
Weak like your parents.

977
01:47:38,069 --> 01:47:40,539
My parents were strong.

978
01:47:40,739 --> 01:47:42,529
They saved me from you.

979
01:47:43,289 --> 01:47:47,469
Your Master Luke Skywalker
was saved by his father.

980
01:47:47,619 --> 01:47:52,899
The only family you
have here is me.

981
01:48:14,459 --> 01:48:17,139
They don't have long.

982
01:48:17,629 --> 01:48:20,879
No one is coming to help them.

983
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:24,999
And you are the one
who led them here.

984
01:48:26,289 --> 01:48:27,949
strike me down.

985
01:48:28,309 --> 01:48:32,119
Take the throne,
reign above the new empire,

986
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:35,139
and the fleet will be yours.

987
01:48:36,619 --> 01:48:40,429
Only you have the power to save them.

988
01:48:42,759 --> 01:48:44,679
refuse...

989
01:48:44,879 --> 01:48:50,139
and your new family... dies.

990
01:49:08,029 --> 01:49:10,529
Good.

991
01:49:25,659 --> 01:49:28,589
Finn, where are you?
The lander is leaving.

992
01:49:28,989 --> 01:49:31,699
- Find.
- go without us.

993
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:34,279
We're taking this entire ship down.

994
01:49:34,829 --> 01:49:38,439
- What? How? - I gonna
hit the command deck.

995
01:49:38,779 --> 01:49:44,819
Rose, please don't.

996
01:49:45,019 --> 01:49:48,329
Hold to the trigger.

997
01:49:49,289 --> 01:49:52,039
The ritual begins!

998
01:49:53,509 --> 01:49:55,809
he will strike me down,

999
01:49:55,929 --> 01:49:59,409
and pledge herself as a Sith.

1000
01:50:19,549 --> 01:50:21,819
She will drow her weapon,

1001
01:50:24,799 --> 01:50:27,519
She will come to me,

1002
01:50:40,299 --> 01:50:43,499
She will take our revenge

1003
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:52,019
and with a sword kick,

1004
01:50:52,139 --> 01:50:54,819
Now Sith are reborn.

1005
01:50:55,829 --> 01:50:59,409
The Jedi are dead!

1006
01:51:20,529 --> 01:51:25,409
do it. Beat, execute the victim.

1007
01:52:33,039 --> 01:52:36,789
stand together, die together.

1008
01:52:46,309 --> 01:52:49,739
The life force of your bond,

1009
01:52:51,839 --> 01:52:58,799
untie that in the force,
a power of life itself.

1010
01:52:59,449 --> 01:53:02,999
unseen, from generations.

1011
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:07,069
And now, the power of two

1012
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:08,889
restores the one,

1013
01:53:09,329 --> 01:53:11,849
true emperor.

1014
01:53:33,259 --> 01:53:35,079
- Break it, I'm in your tail!
- I see it!

1015
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:40,279
- No, no, stop! - No!

1016
01:53:46,279 --> 01:53:48,279
... they're everywhere!

1017
01:53:57,029 --> 01:53:58,529
My friends...

1018
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:02,829
... I'm sorry!

1019
01:54:03,299 --> 01:54:05,519
I thought we had a shot...

1020
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:09,939
... It's just too many of them.

1021
01:54:10,139 --> 01:54:12,219
But there are more of us, Poe!

1022
01:54:12,559 --> 01:54:15,299
More of us!

1023
01:54:25,489 --> 01:54:26,839
look at this!

1024
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:29,299
look at this!


1025
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:40,749
Lando, you did it!  You did it!

1026
01:54:41,479 --> 01:54:43,749
Everyone, hands under his stomach.

1027
01:54:44,029 --> 01:54:47,029
Until we are done with
them, the world is not safe.

1028
01:54:50,009 --> 01:54:53,199
Great pilots, Lando.

1029
01:55:01,279 --> 01:55:04,809
We have a ship down.
A star destroyer fell.

1030
01:55:05,099 --> 01:55:06,499
Where do these fighters come
from, they have no navy.

1031
01:55:06,779 --> 01:55:10,829
It's not a navy, sir, It's just...
people.

1032
01:55:20,459 --> 01:55:23,369
so long sky trash.

1033
01:55:23,569 --> 01:55:26,769
- Who's that flyer?
- take a guess space runner.

1034
01:55:28,869 --> 01:55:31,769
Zori, you made it!

1035
01:55:44,119 --> 01:55:47,029
Look what you have made.

1036
01:56:06,559 --> 01:56:09,019
as I once fell,

1037
01:56:09,185 --> 01:56:13,415
so fool the last Skywalker!

1038
01:56:21,069 --> 01:56:26,679
Don't be afraid of their little assault my faithful,

1039
01:56:26,879 --> 01:56:31,539
nothing will stop the
return of the Sith.

1040
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:44,559
R2, the system is failing.

1041
01:56:45,309 --> 01:56:47,459

1084
02:08:36,969 --> 02:08:38,859

Well, let's find out.

Who you are;

1091
02:11:40,619 --> 02:11:42,239
I'm Rey

1092
02:11:43,279 --> 02:11:45,379
Rey who?

1093
