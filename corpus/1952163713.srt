1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,328
You know,
I used to hear a voice that said

2
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,270
Trouble's coming
Better stay in bed

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,137
Then I even tried to run away

4
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:13,144
'Cause I didn't even know
my own strength

5
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,578
I was shocked
No, I couldn't believe

6
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:18,377
My world rocked
It was news to me

7
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,375
When I looked in the mirror today

8
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:23,683
I looked back and I heard me say

9
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:28,317
I gotta own it, breathe it
Live it like I mean it

10
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:31,294
There's a hero in me
It's all I wanna be

11
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:34,628
Is someone to rely on
Looks good on TV

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,294
Save the day
It's part of the routine

13
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,236
Out of my way
This is a job for me

14
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,865
There's a hero in me
It's all I wanna be

15
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:46,001
Is someone to rely on
Looks good on TV

16
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:48,805
Save the day
It's part of the routine

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,646
Out of my way
This is a job for me

18
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:56,420
There's a hero in me, yeah

19
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,588
There's a hero in me

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,392
And our next book report is
from Jeffrey Zimmer.

21
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,572
Hey.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,043
Well, my report is on Neal Morris'
new Tripp Zoome book,

23
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,477
Freeze-Dried Dreams.

24
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,571
All right!
That's cool!

25
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:26,841
Please tell me this is a joke.

26
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:28,886
Is this some kind
of a joke, Mr. Zimmer?

27
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:31,388
Freeze-Dried Dreams isn't due out
until tomorrow.

28
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,050
I know, but my dad is friends
with this guy who works

29
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:37,391
at this paper factory where they make
the paper that goes in the books.

30
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:41,421
So, well, here it is.

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,333
Well, read on, Mr. Zimmer.

32
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,270
Read on.

33
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,136
It all started at Thor Industries.

34
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:56,840
Tina was frozen with fear

35
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,907
as the ruthless Rudolpho had her
in his clutches once again.

36
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:02,783
It appeared as if her only hope,

37
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:05,687
Agent Tripp Zoome,
was nowhere to be found.

38
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,960
Hey, Rudolpho.

39
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:22,471
Is it me, or did you actually get uglier?

40
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:24,207
Tripp Zoome.

41
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:27,668
Somehow, I knew you'd show up.

42
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:31,805
Cool evil-dude device, evil dude.

43
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:19,261
This isn't over, Tripp Zoome!

44
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,530
This isn't over by a long shot.

45
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,997
And once again,
my man T. Zoome motos to safety

46
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:28,562
and a humongous bash
at his girlfriend's house

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,507
while her parents are away
for the weekend.

48
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:37,138
Bravo!
An insightful and rousing analysis

49
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:41,049
of what I can only anticipate will be
another modern literary masterpiece

50
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:47,183
from Neal Morris, who, of course, is the
father of our very own Melissa Morris.

51
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:50,793
- Tripp rules!
Tripp rules!

52
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:57,358
Don't forget, read at least one book
over the break. Enjoy your vacation.

53
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:05,332
Just when I forget how much
you annoy me, you show up again.

54
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,244
Well, like the book jacket says,
I am unstoppable.

55
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,647
More like unbearable.

56
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,417
You just had to write
another one, huh, Dad?

57
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,650
That's right, Zoomers, it's here!

58
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:22,625
The very latest
in the Tripp Zoome series!

59
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:27,154
And let me be clear, it's Tripp-tastic!

60
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:28,631
Oh, brother.

61
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,795
What? I love that line.

62
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,668
You would. It's all about you.

63
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,639
Who're you talking to?

64
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:41,044
Nobody. I'm just really excited
about tomorrow, you know.

65
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,546
I just can't stop talking about it.

66
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,344
I'm happy for you, honey.

67
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:49,046
I know you've been looking forward to
this camping trip for a long, long time.

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,315
Yeah. You know,
Dad's just been busy with writing

69
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,382
and the Tripp Zoome parades,
and that new ice-cream flavor,

70
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,428
- Triple-Zoome-Crunch.
- Triple-Zoome-Crunch.

71
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,393
It wasn't that bad, actually.

72
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,463
You sure it's okay that I'm going?

73
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:06,163
Sweetheart, he and I may be divorced,

74
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,067
but he's your father,

75
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,131
and I want you to spend
as much time as you can with him.

76
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:12,904
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

77
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,690
Neal.
- Yes!

78
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,357
What do you think?

79
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,662
To be honest,
I voted for the Kevlar cloaking tuxedo,

80
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:38,191
but they think this will sell more books,
so who am I?

81
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:44,706
This is autographed, so you have it.

82
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,376
Thank you.

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,874
- Come on.
- Come on.

84
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,348
So, did you hear?

85
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,386
Tripp's last book sold
over 200,000 copies.

86
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:58,854
I mean, can you imagine what this
thing's gonna do? Go through the roof!

87
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,787
What?

88
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,922
Melissa, your daughter?
You might want to ask how she is.

89
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,022
I know how she is.

90
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,567
She's totally psyched
to be going away with her father!

91
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:13,968
Exactly. Which is why you have to do
everything humanly possible

92
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,064
to make this the best
father-daughter trip ever.

93
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:20,168
Suze, come on.
You're talking to me, Neal Morris.

94
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,505
Yeah. So don't mess it up.

95
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:26,242
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

96
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,651
You don't have to do this.
You know that, right, Dad?

97
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:39,788
What father wouldn't want to go away
on a vacation with his own daughter?

98
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:42,662
I am 150% yours.

99
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:44,694
Okay.

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,473
Yeah, right.

101
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:58,774
I promise you, Melissa, this is
gonna be one week you'll never forget.

102
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,874
You know, I gotta be honest.

103
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,441
I wasn't sure you were gonna
come through on this.

104
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,545
Melissa, when have I
not come through for you?

105
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,315
Whatever. I'm just really excited
about this camping trip.

106
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:09,883
I bought extra bug spray

107
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,623
and a travel edition of Word Wham!
And my new boots.

108
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,255
Word Wham! huh?

109
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,834
What? I know that look.

110
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:22,633
The camping, hiking,
river-rafting thing?

111
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:27,172
We might need to think
just a teeny little switch on that.

112
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:29,736
You can't make a switch.
We made plans. I bought boots.

113
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:32,339
No, no, no. Of course, we're...
We're gonna go camping.

114
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,611
- Really?
- Absolutely.

115
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,950
It's just after we make a quick pit stop
at the Mercury Zoome Convention.

116
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:39,889
- Dad, no.
- Mel, these are my grassroots fans,

117
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,052
the real Zoomers.
I may never get a chance to meet them.

118
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,460
Look, all I have to do is show up,
judge a contest,

119
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:51,525
and then it's you and me
and all the mosquitoes we can swat.

120
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:54,367
- Just the two of us?
- Just the two of us.

121
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,532
I think he means three.

122
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:15,023
Wake up, honey. We're here.
Welcome to paradise.

123
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:21,454
This is good!

124
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,401
These are my people.

125
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:31,632
I think that's the hotel right there.

126
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:41,343
- One night, right?
- Yeah, one night. I promise.

127
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,518
Look! Is that him?
Oh, God! That's him!

128
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,354
That's Neal Morris!

129
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,535
Over here!

130
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,207
Welcome to my world.

131
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,643
Hi, how are you?

132
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,514
Yikes.

133
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,389
How Tripp-tastic is this?

134
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,122
Zoomers incoming!

135
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,394
Yeah, real fun.

136
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,131
- Morris?
Yes.

137
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:39,802
Neal Morris!
Merv Kilbo. Big fan, big fan.

138
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,712
This is, like, crazy, man!

139
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:48,014
Welcome to the little slice of heaven,
my hotel.

140
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,144
Thank you. Thank you very much.

141
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,621
So, we've got you
in the presidential suite.

142
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:57,391
It's top-notch.
Nothing but the best for you, daddy.

143
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,225
The royal treatment.

144
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:02,460
Let me take care of your bags for you.

145
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,533
Hey, Neal, sign my skull.

146
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,129
Be right back.

147
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't mess this up for me.

148
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,944
Of course I won't.
You'll probably do that all on your own.

149
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:19,509
All right.
Just right in the middle? Okay.

150
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:22,109
- Neal Morris. Here you go.
- Awesome.

151
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:23,381
- Thank you.
You're welcome.

152
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,945
The package has arrived.

153
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:29,391
Good work, Shel.
Close it down and return to the roost.

154
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,091
- And Sheldon?
Yeah?

155
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:35,829
Lose the fake voice. It's creepy.

156
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,470
Why do you
always gotta bust me, Wheeze? Why?

157
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:44,633
Eyes on the prize, Sheldon.
We're winning this contest.

158
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,401
- Got me?
- Yeah, I got you.

159
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,482
Double Word Wham.

160
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,519
Bonus word score.

161
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,389
Okay. So, here we are.

162
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:07,260
Merv Kilbo's finest.

163
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:14,671
The presidential suite.

164
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,640
So? Do you love it?

165
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,408
What's not to love?

166
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:27,317
Welcome home, Neal. Welcome home.

167
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,520
Lava lamp.

168
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,780
Cool.

169
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,354
Come on, let's go!

170
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,019
In your third book, Zip, Zoome, Zilch,

171
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:40,656
Tripp finds his way out of
the SCUM cave using the flashlight

172
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,927
that he rewired into a laser, right, Neal?

173
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:45,936
- Actually, the...
- Hello? Drop any brain cells lately?

174
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:46,993
It was his battery-operated toothbrush.

175
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,060
Yeah, yeah, battery-operated.

176
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,073
And he used it as a diamond drill.

177
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,540
- Laser.
- Drill!

178
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:52,769
- Laser!
Drill.

179
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,607
- Laser. Laser. Laser.
- Drill. Drill.

180
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,705
You guys just excuse me.
I'll be right back.

181
00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:58,771
Hello.

182
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,342
You! You... You're him!

183
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,611
In the flesh.

184
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:12,692
- Who should I make it out to?
- Just sign it to me.

185
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,891
Well, I mean, not the word "me,"
but my name.

186
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:18,299
No, no, not "my name,"
but my name, Skunk.

187
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,894
Just sign it to Skunk.

188
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:25,739
"To Skunk, Neal Morris. " There you go.

189
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,543
- Floss.
- Floss!

190
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:34,846
Maurice.

191
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,782
Maurice, look! He signed it!

192
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,950
Would you stop jumping around
like a baby gorilla?

193
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,494
We are not here to get autographs.

194
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:51,728
Go. Go, go, go.
Get, get. Come on, let's go. Move.

195
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,030
Okay, okay.

196
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:57,905
Surrounded by oddballs,
each more desperate

197
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:01,002
and with less a hold on reality
than the next.

198
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,204
Whoa!

199
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,249
Big "whoa," little lady.

200
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,216
Pretty incredible rig, isn't it?

201
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:11,984
Made it myself, straight from the plot
of The Tripp of Time, just like Tripp.

202
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,549
And you did this because?

203
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,389
Because of the contest, newbie.

204
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:21,330
Whoever proves to be Zoome enough
wins the prize.

205
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,291
"Zoome enough"?

206
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:24,392
Oh, yeah.

207
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,733
Whoever can show
they know the most about Tripp Zoome

208
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:30,467
wins the ultimate fan prize, the chance
to become a character in my next book,

209
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,476
and the opportunity to read it
before it's published.

210
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:36,206
Which would be so
amazingly incredible.

211
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:38,171
Yes, it would.

212
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,413
I worship at your feet, Neal.

213
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,048
No need.

214
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,580
Another brush with danger!

215
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,317
The catchphrase.

216
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,649
- Floss!
Floss!

217
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:55,628
And on that note, good night.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,399
Good night.

219
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:01,836
I see you.

220
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,381
Hey, Dad, what do you think about
Grisham Lodge for dinner tonight?

221
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,149
They have this restaurant
where you can sit behind a waterfall.

222
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:20,019
Wow, that's a cool location.

223
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:22,321
That could come in handy
for my next book.

224
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:26,056
Tripp battles piranha
behind a waterfall of toxic sludge.

225
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,026
What?

226
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:32,866
Honey, I'm a writer.

227
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:36,471
I'm always on the prowl
for new material. Tripp demands it.

228
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,236
You act like Tripp Zoome is real, Dad.

229
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,836
He is real, to me. He has to be.

230
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:44,813
Forget it.

231
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,518
Tell you what. Why don't you pack,

232
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,621
I go pick out a contest winner,

233
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,247
we jump in the car,
we're on the road by noon.

234
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,484
- You mean it?
- I mean it.

235
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,117
- Perfect.
- Okay.

236
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:16,605
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Well, well...
Big daddy himself, the king,

237
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,377
Mr. Neal Morris, will determine
which of you crazy cats...

238
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,352
- No.
... is truly Zoome enough!

239
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,480
- Floss! Floss!
- Floss! Floss!

240
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:29,515
I just want you guys to know
that I'm not going anywhere.

241
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,960
I'm staying right here with you!

242
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,631
And time for our next super-fan,
Bobby-O from Cincinnati.

243
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,829
Come on up, buddy.

244
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,372
What's the matter?
Plans not working out?

245
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,409
You got something to say?
Say it to the wall.

246
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,945
That is so much better.

247
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,404
Ow!

248
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:51,846
Watch where you're going, nimrod.

249
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,578
Nimrod? Very mature.

250
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,120
Although it does score you
nine points in Word Wham!

251
00:15:57,188 --> 00:16:00,089
Well, I always use
the triple Word Wham! tiles,

252
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,388
so you do the math, Einstein.

253
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,425
You're a Whammer?

254
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:06,963
Regional whiz. Two years in a row.

255
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,432
Very impressive.

256
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,991
Thanks. It's all about the vowels.

257
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:13,764
Yeah. Vowel power.

258
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:22,003
Well, I'd love to stay
and compare strategies with you,

259
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,673
but business calls.

260
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,513
Business?

261
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:29,714
Whatever.

262
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,516
Nice. You get her digits?

263
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:38,058
Well, I was going to, but it...

264
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:41,195
I cannot believe we're related.

265
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,224
Okay, whatever. I'll be in the van.

266
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:50,397
And by connecting the hairbrush
to the clock radio,

267
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:56,242
I'm able to recreate Tripp's
first official Tripp-Trap Scrambler.

268
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,396
Cool!

269
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,139
Molar to Canine.

270
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:31,739
Distractor is loaded and ready to go.

271
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:35,479
Copy that, Molar.
Phase 2 standing by.

272
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:38,351
Good work, Shel.
Transport standing by.

273
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,457
On my signal. And

274
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,394
go, go, go!

275
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:52,567
Roger that.

276
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:27,997
I found
9,136 mentions of dentists,

277
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:32,873
oral care andlor dental equipment,
16,088 occurrences of the word "floss. "

278
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,873
What is it?
- You smell something?

279
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:40,348
Said the fat man with the nose
of doom upon his grin.

280
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,384
That's good.

281
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,414
How's camping?

282
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:50,585
It's great! Fresh air, beautiful trees.

283
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,663
And traffic? He did it again, didn't he?

284
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,064
Yeah, he did.

285
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,813
Calm down, everyone.

286
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:15,818
I'm sure it's just a ventilation problem.

287
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,079
- Mr. Morris, sir?
Yeah.

288
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:21,317
A moment of your time.
I think I can explain.

289
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:22,518
Okay.

290
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:31,500
Where is that kid going with our guy?
Okay, excuse me, excuse me.

291
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:35,596
I need to get through here.
If you could just move it! Let's go.

292
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:39,074
I just don't know why you
thought this trip would be any different.

293
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:40,132
You never know, Deb.

294
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,736
Something might pop up
and change everything. Right?

295
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:46,271
Whatever you say, Mel.
Just call me when you get back, okay?

296
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,477
Tell your dad "floss" for me.

297
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,111
Sure, whatever.

298
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,380
So, you thought
this trip would be different, huh?

299
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,755
You are thick!

300
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:58,693
It already is different.
As soon as he's done in there.

301
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:02,130
You mean
as soon as he's done with me.

302
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:04,463
You know, for someone
who knows how to save the world,

303
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:06,298
you really are a jerk.

304
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,739
Any minute now, he walks out that door
and it's my vacation, not yours.

305
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,506
Dad?

306
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,849
The Tearjerker. And it works!

307
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:26,048
Yeah!

308
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:29,326
A 16-gallon dust bag, a juice extractor,

309
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,453
and an eight-horsepower wood chipper.

310
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,727
I've got to meet the fans
who put this baby together.

311
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,360
- I think that can be arranged.
- Yeah?

312
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,263
Mr. Zoome, I presume.

313
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,637
Sabotage.

314
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,540
Spin him, spin him, spin him!

315
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:52,041
Yeah!

316
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,378
Hey. They...
They're stealing my writer, Maurice!

317
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,789
Quit your crying, Skunk! We'll get him!

318
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:02,848
Okay.

319
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,724
We need some wheels.

320
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:06,689
Just like those.

321
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:11,333
Okay, calm down. It's gonna be okay.
Everything is under control.

322
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:12,528
Dad!
No, no, no.

323
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:15,663
No one goes in
until the fumes clear out.

324
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,969
- But my dad, he's inside.
No, he isn't.

325
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:22,478
And it's not fumes, it's onions.
Totally Zoome-tastic!

326
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,829
"If one chopped onion makes my mom
cry when she's making lasagna,

327
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:43,060
"think what 1,000 chopped onions
will do to a room full of SCUM agents.

328
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,795
"He smiled, his perfect teeth aglitter. "

329
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,807
Big deal. So some geek had
way too much time on his hands.

330
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:55,903
Where is my father?

331
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,576
All we know for sure is whoever did this
knows his way around a Tripp-Trap.

332
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:11,454
Hey. Where are the tapes to
that camera? I want to check them out.

333
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,427
Are you kidding me?
A bunch of kids took him?

334
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,898
Why couldn't he still be a dentist?

335
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:32,011
Central station,
your call is being recorded.

336
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,448
Hi. Yes, I'd like to report
a missing person.

337
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:36,884
No, he's not missing. He was taken.

338
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,880
Who are we actually
talking about, here?

339
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:42,289
My father. His name's Neal Morris.

340
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,487
He was taken by a bunch of kids,
like, total freak-out losers.

341
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:47,656
Okay, okay. Here, calm down, honey.

342
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:51,326
Are you talking about the same
Neal Morris down at the Merc Hotel?

343
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:52,767
That Zoome fan thing?

344
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:54,531
Yes, yes, exactly.

345
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:57,663
Okay. 'Cause, see,

346
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:00,107
I've been getting a lot of crazy calls
from that place today,

347
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:04,113
you know, like, spies and robots
and double agents.

348
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:07,150
And we got a lot of work down here
at the police station,

349
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:10,550
so you've got to stop bothering me.

350
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,715
Hello! I'm trying to report a crime, here!

351
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,658
Okay, look. Here's the procedure.

352
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:19,662
You wait 48 hours.
If he doesn't turn up then,

353
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,857
then you come down to the station,
you fill out a report.

354
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:24,423
Okay? That's the system.

355
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,628
Well, the system is stupid.

356
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:31,701
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

357
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,003
I'm just surprised.

358
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:35,204
Surprised? At what?

359
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,371
You.

360
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:40,141
You get this big shot at being me,
you don't take it.

361
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,980
Are you kidding me?

362
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,213
First of all, I don't want to be you.

363
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:47,985
I would hate to be you.
In fact, I hate you.

364
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,188
Wow, kind of harsh. Don't you think?

365
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:57,223
Don't you have a super-villain to wrap
in dental floss or something?

366
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,895
Nope. I'm all yours.

367
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,767
And it looks like you're gonna be
needing me, too.

368
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,205
'Cause we both know
you are not Zoome enough

369
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:06,242
to get Neal back on your own.

370
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,870
Hey, this is the real world.

371
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:13,713
In the real world, 15-year-olds don't
save their fathers from freaky fan guys.

372
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:18,554
You know what? You're right, 100%.

373
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:23,117
I guess that's why
your father writes about me, not you.

374
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:49,313
He adjusts the disguise,
a colander of deception.

375
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:56,757
What? Every writer knows
it's the power of the words.

376
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:59,523
Do you even know
what a colander is, Skunk?

377
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:03,358
Do you? Because I don't.
But I can still tell you,

378
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:07,097
there is no such thing
as a colander of deception.

379
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:12,703
Okay, careful.
We gotta time this just right.

380
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,921
- Is this Zoome enough for you, Neal?
- What's going on here?

381
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:34,293
What is that smell?

382
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:35,956
The cords are soaked in mentho-rub.

383
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,933
The more you squirm,
the more you burn.

384
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:42,028
The Vapo Wrist Wrap,
Tripp's Last Trip. Page 89.

385
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,669
This is kind of amazing. And painful.

386
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:54,009
- Come on, kids, get me out of this.
- Kids? We ain't kids.

387
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:56,418
We're your worst nightmare.

388
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,318
Stuff him!

389
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:01,152
Dirty sweat sock. You wrote it, we do it.

390
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:29,143
Hey.

391
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,405
- Who's Melissa?
- That's my daughter.

392
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:54,967
Let me just tell her that I'm okay.

393
00:26:56,814 --> 00:27:02,810
Come on, guys. In Tripp of No Return,
even evil Professor Nix got to do that.

394
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:04,813
Okay.

395
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:07,218
- Hello?
Dad?

396
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,225
Melissa, honey, you okay?

397
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,761
I can't believe you did this to me, Dad.
It's so typical.

398
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:14,696
What? I didn't do anything.

399
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,630
Everything's not always my fault,
you know.

400
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,429
- Floss, floss, floss!
- Floss, floss, floss!

401
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:21,062
Okay, here's the deal.
Your dad is fine, okay?

402
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:23,766
And as soon as he agrees
to our one demand, he's home free.

403
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:27,368
So why don't you run along and go play
with the other little kiddies at the hotel?

404
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:29,002
And with whom am I speaking, please?

405
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,445
Why's that matter?

406
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:33,949
So I can use your name
in a complete sentence, nimrod.

407
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:38,177
Nimrod. Real mature.

408
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:42,792
Wait a minute. I know that voice.

409
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:46,227
Word Wham! guy! It's you!

410
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:48,093
You're Neal's daughter?

411
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:50,359
I guess vocabulary gene
skips a generation, huh?

412
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:51,458
Excuse me. May I say something?

413
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:52,661
- No!
- No!

414
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:56,804
Look, I don't know what twisted dream
you think you're fulfilling,

415
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:00,401
but you're totally ruining my vacation.
And that's not okay!

416
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:01,705
Feisty.

417
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,144
I like it.

418
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:08,579
Okay. Just tell me where you are,
and I'll come get my dad.

419
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:09,676
Tell you?

420
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:10,845
Hmm.

421
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:12,921
I don't think so.

422
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,220
Pine mist or lilac spray?

423
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:18,221
Floss.

424
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,130
"Pine scent or lilac"?

425
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,098
So, what's the plan?

426
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:28,969
Mr. Kilbo, does this town
have a car wash?

427
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,597
Yes. Why?

428
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:35,277
No, no, no, bro. There.

429
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:38,271
No, no, no, there.

430
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:40,210
No, no, no, there.

431
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,346
Hold on.

432
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,925
Right there. You see? Yeah.

433
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:55,962
The girl!

434
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,931
You know, you gotta admire
her enthusiasm.

435
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,906
You just had to get the hot wax,
didn't you?

436
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:06,943
It coats and protects.

437
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,774
All right. Drive around back.
We'll pull a toss-and-wash.

438
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:11,040
Right.

439
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:21,152
This is the place? You're sure?

440
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:23,920
Yeah. This the only car wash for miles.

441
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,264
Hey, you mind
if I make a quick call, kiddo?

442
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:32,200
Want to make sure the Merc hasn't
been taken over by evil aliens.

443
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,396
Yeah, those Zoome kids
are pretty weird.

444
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:37,440
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm gonna take a look around.

445
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:51,277
Yeah, it's me. I'm at the car wash.
The car... Don't ask.

446
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:02,691
What am I doing?

447
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:08,068
My car!

448
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:15,367
Hit the brake!

449
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:17,779
Which one's the brake?

450
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:19,978
It's in the middle!

451
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,867
Found the brake.

452
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,303
Great.

453
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:17,572
"Word Wham! Made Easy. "

454
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:20,676
It's due today.

455
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,511
Give, give, give, give them to me.

456
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,285
What's the girl got to do with all this?

457
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:32,788
What's it matter?
As long as she takes us to her father.

458
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:47,861
What?

459
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:50,498
Your nose is smaller in the picture.

460
00:31:52,642 --> 00:31:54,075
Way smaller.

461
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:57,678
Well, thank you, sort of.

462
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:02,617
You know, that book is due today.

463
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:04,211
So?

464
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,556
So, you have to pay a fine
every day it's late.

465
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:09,057
- Are you serious?
Yeah.

466
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:11,151
- Yeah, right.
Of course.

467
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:13,696
What, are all these books overdue?

468
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,058
Yeah!

469
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,269
Move! You've got to keep up!
We're losing them!

470
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,836
I am driving as fast as I can!

471
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:34,042
Said his brother, with an off-key head.

472
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:38,949
That makes no sense!

473
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:48,560
All right, guys, listen.
This has been great,

474
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:53,160
and you're as Zoome as they come.
But there are other fans waiting for me.

475
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:56,464
It's not really fair to them, is it?

476
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,934
All right, Neal.

477
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:03,604
Okay, we'll make you a deal.

478
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,581
If you show us
the Book Splat Tripp-Trap,

479
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,415
- then we'll let you go.
- Yeah.

480
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:18,524
Setting a Splat Trapp is
as delicate as wisdom-tooth surgery.

481
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:28,193
You sure you don't want me
to come in with you?

482
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,035
No, I can handle this part.
We'll be right out, okay?

483
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,233
Cool.

484
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:36,412
So how does it feel? Exhilarating, huh?

485
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:39,004
I think the word is "traumatizing. "

486
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,081
Poor little baby.

487
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:44,518
Tell you what, why don't you go soak
in a bubble bath,

488
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,055
let me handle the dirty work?

489
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:47,680
- Dream on.
- Hey.

490
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,555
Just get him, grab him and go.

491
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:52,689
Thanks.

492
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:08,268
All right, it's go time.

493
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:10,869
Hold on, little brother.

494
00:34:12,182 --> 00:34:13,979
Let's do this right.

495
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:26,762
All right, very gently,
no sudden movements.

496
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:31,190
There you go. Nice. This will do it.

497
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,865
Get him, grab him and go.

498
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:45,037
You set it on any shelf,
holding it tightly,

499
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:50,109
and the next unsuspecting librarian
gets a Tripp-tastic surprise.

500
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:21,614
This is just perfect.

501
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:23,452
Melissa, you found me.

502
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,148
Found you? I thought I was saving you.

503
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:29,248
But apparently, you and the nerd patrol
are doing just fine.

504
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,920
- Yeah, we are having a blast.
Yeah.

505
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:35,260
I got to tell you, these kids are great.
And total, 100% fans.

506
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:37,061
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, we are!

507
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,361
This is Sheldon.

508
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,494
He gets
that same gum irritation that you do.

509
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,037
And this spitfire's Andre.

510
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:45,632
And his big brother, Wheeze.
I think you guys have met.

511
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,643
- Wheeze?
- Wheeze.

512
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:51,340
Okay. Listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, here.

513
00:35:51,414 --> 00:35:52,779
You think?

514
00:35:53,149 --> 00:35:54,776
Okay, I know you're new
to the whole Zoome world,

515
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:57,911
but can you maybe just lighten up?

516
00:35:57,987 --> 00:36:00,285
Your dad's just trying
to have some fun with us.

517
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:03,884
Really? Well, Wheeze, the thing is,

518
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,588
he's supposed to be
having fun with me!

519
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:12,291
- You smell nice.
- I do? Thanks, it's my gloss.

520
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:15,295
- What is that, cherry?
- No, watermelon.

521
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:16,703
Cherry makes my lips swell.

522
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:18,331
Understandable.

523
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:22,743
Dad, we're leaving, now!
I have to get this stuff off my face!

524
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,549
Sorry, guys, got to go.

525
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:29,308
See you.
- Call me.

526
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:30,512
Floss.
Later.

527
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:35,213
Honey, I'm sorry. Look, they took me.
It was just a game.

528
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:36,519
A game?

529
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,024
It's kind of funny, actually,
if you think about it.

530
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:43,031
All right, maybe "funny"
is the wrong word.

531
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:44,760
You just don't get it.

532
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,927
- Well, then... Then tell me.
- Dad,

533
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:51,039
I've been thinking about this vacation
ever since school started.

534
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:52,768
I packed my suitcase weeks ago,

535
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:55,970
and then unpacked it
and repacked it, like, five times,

536
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:58,070
'cause I wanted everything
to be perfect.

537
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:02,312
Just me and my dad, finally spending
some quality time together.

538
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,013
Well, that's what I wanted, too,
and I still do want that.

539
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:06,749
Yeah, well, that's all great

540
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:10,156
until you-know-who comes along
and ruins everything.

541
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:12,752
"You-know-who"?

542
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:18,223
Tripp?
Honey, he's a fictional character.

543
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:20,895
No, Dad.
Peter Pan is a fictional character.

544
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,029
Tripp Zoome is a pain in my butt.

545
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:25,597
Freeze! Police! Freeze!

546
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:29,008
Excuse us, Officers,
we're having a little moment, here.

547
00:37:29,078 --> 00:37:33,174
Right. Moment's over, writer guy.
All right, Officer Skunk, grab him.

548
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:35,307
Officer Skunk?

549
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,811
I love your books.

550
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:40,151
Wait a minute. I know you guys.
From the... From the hotel.

551
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:42,521
- You're not real cops.
- Okay.

552
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:43,923
You see the badge?
You see it? What's it say?

553
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:47,258
- I don't know, I don't have my glasses.
- And what's this?

554
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,560
- A stapler.
- A stapler, yeah.

555
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:55,196
Okay, cuff him.

556
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:58,865
- Oh, no, you don't.
Melissa!

557
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:01,410
- No, no, no, no, not you!
- What are you... Melissa!

558
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:03,639
What? I just got you back.
I'm not losing you again.

559
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:05,237
That was supposed to be my wrist!

560
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:06,577
- Well, you snooze, you lose.
- What are you...

561
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:08,276
Okay, all right, cell phones.

562
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,717
Is this it? Come on, let's go. Let's go.

563
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:11,811
Guys...
Come on.

564
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:12,877
...one abduction a day, that's my limit.

565
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,048
Shut your trap and keep moving.

566
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:19,091
Guys, you should come see this.

567
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,166
This is what I call no está bueno.

568
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:30,001
Let's go, guys.
Something's really wrong.

569
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:34,603
Hurry! They're getting away!

570
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,217
Hey, fellows, I think there's been
some sort of mistake here.

571
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,724
Yeah, ain't that always the case?

572
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,395
Don't lose them, Wheeze.

573
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:58,298
Quit riding me, Sheldon.
I'm driving the best I can, dude.

574
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:09,011
Central station.
Your call is being recorded.

575
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:10,545
Hello? Police?

576
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,604
Neal Morris has been stolen!

577
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:13,910
Hey, listen, kids.

578
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:16,713
You can't be tying up the phone lines
like this with these prank calls.

579
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,686
- It's against the law.
- This is no prank!

580
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:21,588
- Two goons took him for real.
- Okay, look.

581
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:25,585
I got at 1:25,
he was supposedly snatched.

582
00:39:25,662 --> 00:39:29,598
And then at 2:32,
I got three calls from the supermarket,

583
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,998
saying that he was in a van,
and he was tied up

584
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:35,663
with what they described
as dental floss.

585
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:37,262
Well, mint flavored, and we're...

586
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,501
Listen, kid,
enough with the fun and games.

587
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:42,909
We're very busy down
at the police station. Goodbye.

588
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,843
And we're not kids!

589
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,085
Looks like it's up to us.

590
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:52,587
Let's do it.

591
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,990
Chalk this one up for creepy.

592
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:41,934
No. Make that creepy times two.

593
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:54,306
You live here?

594
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:58,320
The city's stupid enough
to pump electric in. Why shouldn't we?

595
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,224
Really cozy.

596
00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:08,187
Look, whatever it is you're after,

597
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:10,994
I'm sure we can work this out
in a safe and peaceful manner.

598
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:12,295
- Really? You're sure of that?
- Really.

599
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:13,892
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

600
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,873
Sure you're just not hoping,
maybe praying, that we can?

601
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,608
Skunk, hurry it up.
Our guests are getting antsy.

602
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,171
Just a minute.

603
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:29,710
"There's no turning back now," he said,

604
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:33,813
as he stood on the line
between good and Iowa.

605
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:40,226
I'm scared.

606
00:41:40,296 --> 00:41:42,924
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

607
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:47,299
Well, that, my friend,
is entirely up to you.

608
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:59,209
I don't know about this,
Wheeze. This is way out of our league.

609
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:02,342
Yeah. And you guys
returned all those Zoome books.

610
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:03,851
That was really smart.

611
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,751
Hey. They were overdue.

612
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:07,722
All right, everybody chill.
We don't need the books.

613
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,156
We know every page
of every novel inside and out.

614
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:14,754
There's a Tripp Zoome solution to this.
We just haven't figured it out yet.

615
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:18,261
Lady and gentlemen,

616
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:22,066
it's snack time!

617
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:25,830
Mmm.

618
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:28,343
That's good. That's good.

619
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:33,075
The part I love best is, there's no meat
whatsoever in these things.

620
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:35,208
All right, what do you guys want?
You want money?

621
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:37,479
Come on. It always
comes back to that, doesn't it?

622
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:38,577
Money, money, money.

623
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:41,179
Listen, whatever you're planning,
we won't go along with it, okay?

624
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:45,193
So, go ahead, send his publisher
a ransom note. See if we care!

625
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,092
- Not helping.
- Okay.

626
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,393
Don't worry about us, kid.

627
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:51,729
We always get what we want.

628
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,702
That is one thing we are very good at.

629
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,398
Okay! Here we go.

630
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:03,368
Look at this.

631
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:07,511
"Lights Out Lenny"?

632
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,448
It's a working title.

633
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,817
See, my brother, he has a gift.

634
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:15,754
Please tell me it's not cooking.

635
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:18,759
- A creative gift!
- Okay! Touchy.

636
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:24,459
Of course, my writing's
not as good as yours is, but...

637
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:27,367
But that's why you're here. Okay?

638
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:31,132
Keep him from making
the same mistakes I made.

639
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:33,666
Maurice stole an elephant.

640
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,369
That's true.

641
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:39,346
I did the crime,
then I did the time, all right?

642
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:42,612
But, look, look, look.
My baby brother, here? He's clean!

643
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:46,314
And with a little outside help, I mean,
there's no stopping this guy.

644
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:49,222
So, you took me to read
your brother's book?

645
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:52,352
No, not read, to fix.
Fix my brother's book.

646
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:54,396
- See, my brother needs...
- A brain, Scarecrow?

647
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,999
You are really starting to irritate me.

648
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:02,697
And you really don't want to do that.

649
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:06,766
Look, my brother needs a real writer
to finish the book.

650
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:11,112
Guys, look, in the best
of environments,

651
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,514
even with the best writers,
this could take weeks. Months, even.

652
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:21,416
Months? Years? I really don't care.

653
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:25,651
Because the way that I see it,
until you fix the book,

654
00:44:26,562 --> 00:44:28,325
you're not leaving.

655
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:32,229
What? Stuck here, in this stink-hole?

656
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:39,132
Consider it incentive, sweetheart.
Daddy writes fast, princess goes home.

657
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,414
Chapter 1.

658
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,713
"The sky was dark
and the air was cold

659
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:57,088
"and the man held the gun so tight,
his fingers felt like cheese. "

660
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:58,820
- Cheddar.
- Oh, boy.

661
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,695
- We're gaining on them, Vic!
Gaining on them, Vic!

662
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:11,331
Oh, boy, look at that car go!
- Boy, look at that car go.

663
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:13,204
Faster, Gordon, faster!
Faster, Gordon, faster!

664
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:15,176
They're coming after us.
- They're coming after us.

665
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,840
If he doesn't watch,
he's gonna wreck that car!

666
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:26,949
Oh, God.

667
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:33,553
This is so bad, my eyes actually hurt.
How do you fix something this broken?

668
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,966
Well, every problem's
just a doorway to a solution.

669
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:42,061
I mean, that's what you write
for Tripp, anyway.

670
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:46,333
I've read the books, Dad.

671
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:49,640
I just don't get dressed up
like Agent X309

672
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:52,044
and go to Zoome-cons
every other weekend.

673
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:54,908
What?

674
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:59,844
Nothing. It's just that X309 is
a 250-pound Chinese guy,

675
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:01,184
so I think you'd look kind of funny.

676
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:05,559
Sorry.

677
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:09,492
Hey! You know what we need?
A Distractor!

678
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:11,396
No, no, no, no, no... No way.

679
00:46:11,467 --> 00:46:14,595
Dad, we have to get out of here.
In case you haven't noticed,

680
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,399
those two guys out there,
they're kind of wacko.

681
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:20,704
Which is exactly why I don't want
to risk your neck on some silly plan.

682
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,605
Silly? We're back to that, are we?

683
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:31,316
How could I possibly have an idea
worthy of the amazing Tripp Zoome?

684
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:34,411
- Melissa, that's not...
- You know,

685
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,219
it all comes down to this, Dad.

686
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:40,786
You care more about Tripp Zoome
than you do about your own daughter.

687
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:43,764
Now, that... That is ridiculous.

688
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,061
- It is?
- Yeah.

689
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:47,466
Then how come
you've never written about me, huh?

690
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:50,004
How come I'm not a character
in one of your books?

691
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,934
You? Sweetheart.

692
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:56,308
Characters are... They're dynamic.
They're larger than life.

693
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:59,439
They're capable
of extraordinary things.

694
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,346
Tripp has three advanced degrees.

695
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:02,975
He's got encyclopedic knowledge
of science.

696
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:05,247
- He speaks 10 languages fluently.
- Okay.

697
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:08,757
Then what are my interests, Dad, huh?
What do I like?

698
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:23,169
Do you realize you missed
every one of my dance recitals?

699
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:25,571
I wanted to be there. I really did.

700
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,166
Or how about the time I won
Middle School Creative Writing Award?

701
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:32,078
You won a writing contest? That...
Why, that's great, Melissa.

702
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,116
Two years in a row, Dad.

703
00:47:36,552 --> 00:47:40,318
Just own it, Dad. Tripp comes first.

704
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:43,223
I...

705
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:46,728
Forget it. I'm sorry I brought it up.

706
00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:01,567
Cops! Moe! Moe, what do we do?

707
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:04,636
We get out while we still can!
Grab them, now!

708
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:17,916
Let's go, fast!

709
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:21,328
You know, Skunk,
you don't have to do this.

710
00:48:21,397 --> 00:48:23,160
Well, that's real easy for you to say.

711
00:48:23,232 --> 00:48:25,166
Last time I checked,
you were a best-selling author,

712
00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:27,930
and I'm... It doesn't matter what I am.

713
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,905
- That's my brother. Now, move it!
Okay. Easy!

714
00:48:32,975 --> 00:48:34,203
Move it!

715
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:39,911
Stake Out Fake Out.
Simple, yet effective.

716
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,679
Looks like you're gonna be
doing your work on the road.

717
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:46,345
You, too, funny girl. Get in.

718
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,390
Yo, Andre, hit it again.

719
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:50,755
You got it. Track number seven.

720
00:48:55,397 --> 00:48:56,887
Sorry, my bad.

721
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:03,365
Sounds like hundreds of them.
And they have animals!

722
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:05,031
Get in the truck.

723
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,342
I got it.

724
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:30,891
So, Neal, what do you think
about my book?

725
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:36,127
Yeah, well,
what you... What you wrote so far is,

726
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:38,435
- you know, it's... Well, it's kind of...
- Cut to the chase.

727
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,975
Awful? I think the word is "awful. "

728
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:42,772
But salvageable, really.

729
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:45,746
I think there's a lot
of good ideas that work.

730
00:49:45,814 --> 00:49:48,806
Yeah, they're just surrounded
by terrible ideas that don't.

731
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:52,786
Okay, I mean, I admit,
the exploding elephant is different.

732
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:55,847
But back me up on this, Dad,
your dialogue is inconsistent.

733
00:49:55,925 --> 00:50:00,225
It takes the reader out of the story.
It's way too "bang-bang, tough guy. "

734
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:02,787
Yeah. You know what? She's right.
No one really talks like this.

735
00:50:02,865 --> 00:50:04,492
And the plot is...

736
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,228
- There is no plot.
- There is no plot, really.

737
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:08,293
You just kind of have to
work through this thing.

738
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,031
What did I tell you, Skunk?

739
00:50:10,105 --> 00:50:13,302
This is the start
of a whole new life for you.

740
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:18,870
Now, we can get down to business.
All right. You two, start fixing!

741
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:21,512
What, write the book here? Like this?

742
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:24,519
Yeah, yeah. Just like this.
You got a problem with that?

743
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:26,817
No problem.
Look forward to the challenge.

744
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:37,995
My main man, Tripp, gonna give them

745
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:39,796
all the slip with the dental floss

746
00:50:39,868 --> 00:50:41,893
Gonna show them who's boss

747
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:43,864
What?

748
00:50:43,939 --> 00:50:45,964
I said, my main man!

749
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:47,940
My main man, Zoome

750
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,910
Yeah, he makes the ladies swoon

751
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:54,506
Okay, the first thing I suggest is,
reestablish your open.

752
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,552
I mean, you know, your first sentence
really needs to grab the reader,

753
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,746
and yours just...

754
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:00,482
- Doesn't.
- Doesn't.

755
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,993
Stupid road!

756
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:14,502
Great! We're being followed.

757
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,699
It's those brats in the van!

758
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:18,967
Really?

759
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:31,675
All right, let's see what they got!

760
00:51:36,925 --> 00:51:40,088
Guys, are we speeding up
or are they slowing down?

761
00:51:41,897 --> 00:51:43,990
Scary-looking, freaky dude!

762
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:46,360
Oh, God! What are you doing?

763
00:51:47,936 --> 00:51:49,801
Dad!
You gotta stop!

764
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:54,266
It's the attack of the killer pants!

765
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:02,310
Now we're talking!

766
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:05,583
If there's one scratch on my ride,
it's gonna get ugly.

767
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,159
Wheeze!

768
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:30,876
We got them!

769
00:52:42,424 --> 00:52:44,517
Great. We're stuck.

770
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:03,974
So, what did you think, Neal?
Was I Zoome enough?

771
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:06,276
Hey, those are just kids!
You guys are way out of line, here!

772
00:53:06,348 --> 00:53:08,612
- Dad.
- Yeah, Dad. Shut your mouth

773
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:11,619
before you say something
you wish you hadn't.

774
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:16,219
Now what?

775
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:21,285
We're almost out of gas?
All right, next time, we grab a hybrid!

776
00:53:21,363 --> 00:53:24,264
Hey, when you find a station,
I have to go to the bathroom.

777
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:25,823
Not my problem.

778
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:28,062
Hey, guys, come on. Be reasonable.

779
00:53:28,137 --> 00:53:30,731
Hey, it's okay, Moe. I'll go with her.

780
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:31,898
What?

781
00:53:32,574 --> 00:53:34,872
I mean, I'll stand by the door.

782
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:01,297
What are you doing?

783
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,235
- What? I'm cold.
- Fine.

784
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:07,598
Hey! Easy on the elbow.
I might want to play tennis someday.

785
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:09,735
You don't like me very much, do you?

786
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:13,145
Like you? Think like a writer, Skunk.
You're the bad guy.

787
00:54:13,215 --> 00:54:15,308
Well, maybe I'm the confused,
likable bad guy.

788
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:17,614
Did you ever think about that?

789
00:54:34,736 --> 00:54:36,567
Hurry it up in there.

790
00:54:37,206 --> 00:54:38,332
You wish!

791
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:42,366
Maybe next time, you'll think twice
about serving 10-year-old hot dogs.

792
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:47,640
And can you back away from the door?
I can't, you know...

793
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,207
Right. Sorry.

794
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,123
I'd kill for a comb.

795
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:03,528
I don't know,
I think you're holding up pretty good.

796
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:09,062
What is with you?
Showing up, ruining my life?

797
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:11,496
I didn't sign up for this.

798
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,898
You don't get it, do you?

799
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:15,767
Get what?

800
00:55:15,844 --> 00:55:18,904
I'm in your head
because you keep me there.

801
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:21,477
Come on.

802
00:55:24,353 --> 00:55:27,584
- Do you ever think of that?
- That's ridiculous.

803
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:30,887
You think you know everything,
and always have to shove it in my face

804
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:34,793
like I'm some child who can't figure out
anything for herself.

805
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:44,336
Which is crazy, 'cause if you're in
my head, then I am thinking like you.

806
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:22,243
No, we had to leave.
It was out of our hands.

807
00:56:22,578 --> 00:56:25,547
Yeah, no, I know that! Okay.

808
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:28,749
- Hey.
- Hey.

809
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:32,885
I swiped you some beef jerky. Eat up!

810
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:45,124
Sorry, I just...

811
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,328
Forget it.
Let's just get this show on the road.

812
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:55,509
I'm hot now.

813
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:03,545
Come on.

814
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:07,550
Where are we going?

815
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:09,689
The only way we can go.

816
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:17,295
This stuff is disgusting.

817
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:19,527
Maybe. But it's dinner.

818
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:24,905
So if I were you, I'd shut up and chew.
And make his book better.

819
00:57:31,413 --> 00:57:33,142
Guys, this is nuts.

820
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:37,083
My dad needs a real place to write,
one that doesn't have potholes.

821
00:57:37,152 --> 00:57:38,983
Why don't you just take us back
to the hotel?

822
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:40,544
At least they have a computer there.

823
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:44,615
No, no, no, no, no. I'm fine.
These conditions are great. Just...

824
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:49,225
Guess what?
The kid genius is actually right.

825
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:52,892
This is not working out.
We're going back to the hotel.

826
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,970
They've been here.

827
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:04,512
The bathroom!

828
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:13,614
It's a page from
Zoome Time Boom Time.

829
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:16,455
She circled the word "presidential. "

830
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:18,516
Well, how do you know it's from her?

831
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:22,326
Watermelon-flavored lip gloss.

832
00:58:24,132 --> 00:58:26,862
Okay, everyone think.
What's this mean?

833
00:58:28,537 --> 00:58:32,303
Presidential, presidents,
pickles, dill pickles.

834
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:34,672
They took her to a pickle farm!

835
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:37,902
No.

836
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:42,313
Presidential suite.

837
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:44,511
They're staying
in the presidential suite.

838
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:47,555
I heard them when they checked in!
Come on!

839
00:58:49,524 --> 00:58:52,015
Yeah, well, guess it could be that.

840
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:09,640
- All right, everybody out. Let's go.
Okay.

841
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:11,645
Never thought I'd be glad
to see this place again.

842
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:13,340
Yeah, me, neither.

843
00:59:15,183 --> 00:59:21,088
No one here cares what you think,
Daddy-O, just what you write.

844
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:26,987
Freeze-Dried Dreams?
More like Warmed-Over Nightmares.

845
00:59:29,397 --> 00:59:31,627
Wait a minute.
You're working with them?

846
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,669
Well, don't get crazy!
They work for me.

847
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:40,867
But before, you helped me.

848
00:59:40,942 --> 00:59:43,672
You were so good at finding your pop.

849
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:45,645
- Hey, don't you touch...
Hey.

850
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:49,317
You helped me tell them
right where to go.

851
00:59:49,384 --> 00:59:50,646
Now, take them upstairs to my pad.

852
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,211
- Our room would be better.
- And get that book finished!

853
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:57,448
I have to go back to work.

854
00:59:58,727 --> 01:00:00,922
Let's go.
Hey!

855
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:08,467
Easy, there.

856
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:22,381
Retro-creepy.

857
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:24,350
Okay, come on, move it.

858
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:26,945
There you go.

859
01:00:27,022 --> 01:00:30,287
All right.
You are going to be very safe here.

860
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:33,885
And it should give you enough time
to finish the book.

861
01:00:36,865 --> 01:00:40,130
I just don't get it.
Why is Merv making you do this?

862
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:43,638
He's not making us. He's helping us.

863
01:00:43,705 --> 01:00:46,606
He's gonna get my book published,
like Neal.

864
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:57,615
Usually, I just deliver the pizza,
you know.

865
01:00:57,686 --> 01:00:59,085
Never delivered customers before.

866
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:01,019
- Hey, first time for everything.
Yeah.

867
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:03,614
By the way, the pizza is slamming!

868
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:06,756
Best crust in town.

869
01:01:09,397 --> 01:01:11,627
- So, who wants some tunes, huh?
- Yeah!

870
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,792
Yeah!

871
01:01:26,414 --> 01:01:27,608
Thanks.

872
01:01:34,689 --> 01:01:35,986
The Merv?

873
01:01:36,057 --> 01:01:37,957
Looks like little Merv's got big ideas.

874
01:01:38,026 --> 01:01:40,324
So do you.
Nice edit on this character stuff.

875
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:41,823
Thanks.

876
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,734
- I didn't know you drank coffee.
- Well, it's mostly milk. Mom's orders.

877
01:01:48,803 --> 01:01:51,601
Okay, okay, how's this?

878
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:56,106
"The drive-in snack bar
was a sloppy room,

879
01:01:56,845 --> 01:02:00,872
"filled with all sorts
of junky stuff and stuff. "

880
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:06,150
Not bad, not bad.
But remember what I told you before.

881
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:08,348
When you first describe a location...

882
01:02:08,423 --> 01:02:10,983
Try and help the reader know more
than what it looks like.

883
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:14,051
Imagine what it feels like,
even smells like.

884
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:15,528
Okay, okay.

885
01:02:16,765 --> 01:02:23,295
"The sparkling palace
smelled of gross, dirty socks,

886
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:29,134
"And a short bald man
in need of a bath. "

887
01:02:29,778 --> 01:02:31,211
I heard that.

888
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:34,742
All right! Now, that's believable detail.
Right, Dad?

889
01:02:34,816 --> 01:02:37,250
That's really good, Skunk, really.

890
01:02:39,988 --> 01:02:42,718
You're pretty amazing. You know that?

891
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:45,123
Thanks. So are you.

892
01:02:56,204 --> 01:02:57,466
Incoming!

893
01:03:01,343 --> 01:03:02,970
Come on!

894
01:03:08,883 --> 01:03:10,783
This is The Merc. How may I help you?

895
01:03:25,066 --> 01:03:28,900
You just sign it to "Carl Janhansen,
friend, artist, pizza man. "

896
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,995
You got it, my friend.
Thanks again for the lift.

897
01:03:31,072 --> 01:03:34,337
- Yeah.
- And thank you for the coupons!

898
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:37,242
Man, I can't wait
for Two-For-One Tuesday!

899
01:03:44,652 --> 01:03:47,212
No. That's not an elephant, Officer.

900
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:03,403
Love is a burger and fries

901
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:06,338
You're the heartburn of my soul

902
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:10,435
Remember, good ideas get great
only if you don't get hurt.

903
01:04:12,647 --> 01:04:14,308
Do you even hear how you sound?

904
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:16,850
Why do you always have to talk
in catchphrases?

905
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:18,385
Fans like it.

906
01:04:19,054 --> 01:04:21,716
Yeah. Just hope the fans like my idea.

907
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:25,784
It is a good plan, right?

908
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:30,262
Right. Asking you is the same
as asking myself.

909
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:32,526
And I already know the answer.

910
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,068
It's another brush with danger.

911
01:04:35,703 --> 01:04:37,295
- Floss.
- Floss.

912
01:04:37,372 --> 01:04:39,806
That is such a lousy catchphrase.

913
01:04:40,241 --> 01:04:42,004
Yeah, I know.

914
01:04:43,244 --> 01:04:45,178
Work on that, will you?

915
01:04:52,087 --> 01:04:53,884
I told you, pickle farm.

916
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:55,047
What?

917
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:58,250
I'm just saying.

918
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,288
In the book, Tripp breathes
underwater using straws

919
01:05:05,366 --> 01:05:07,561
held together by rubber bands!

920
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:11,138
No. No, that's not it.

921
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,035
But we know she has the book.

922
01:05:14,275 --> 01:05:15,503
What would she do?

923
01:05:15,577 --> 01:05:18,774
She's Neal's daughter.
She's gotta be Zoome enough.

924
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,738
The Signal of Strength.

925
01:05:20,815 --> 01:05:23,045
- What?
- Tripp's Signal of Strength, remember?

926
01:05:23,118 --> 01:05:25,313
The big climax from
Zoome Time Boom Time.

927
01:05:25,386 --> 01:05:27,513
After he gets stuck
in the whirlpool of plaque,

928
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:28,988
SCUM agents take him prisoner...

929
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:32,515
And Tripp creates a signal that leads
the cloned rebels to where he is!

930
01:05:32,594 --> 01:05:34,152
- She's brilliant.
- Dude,

931
01:05:34,229 --> 01:05:36,595
if you don't ask her out, I will.

932
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,330
Now all we gotta do is find the signal.
Let's get some help.

933
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:44,834
Once again, you fail to strike even the
slightest chord of intelligent thought.

934
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:46,601
Tripp would never appear

935
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:48,733
in a community theater
production of Hamlet.

936
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,072
Shakespeare gives him hives.

937
01:05:50,145 --> 01:05:51,169
Folks!

938
01:05:51,246 --> 01:05:55,012
Your grasp of my argument is as
slippery as the vegetable-oil-soaked

939
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,278
waterslide Tripp slid down
to escape the zombies!

940
01:05:57,352 --> 01:05:58,751
- Zoomers!
- No way.

941
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,014
- Way.
- Newbie.

942
01:06:00,088 --> 01:06:01,851
- Flyboy.
- Zircon.

943
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:07,091
Thanks, bro.
All right, everybody, listen up.

944
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:08,652
Okay, I got some good news
and some bad news,

945
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,129
and they both lead to the same place.

946
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:11,722
Neal's in trouble.

947
01:06:11,799 --> 01:06:13,596
- Big trouble.
- And we're gonna save him!

948
01:06:14,836 --> 01:06:16,133
- Floss!
- Floss!

949
01:06:16,204 --> 01:06:17,603
And Melissa.

950
01:06:19,974 --> 01:06:23,569
Just what I need, clever kids.

951
01:06:27,348 --> 01:06:30,408
You know,
I used to hear a voice that said

952
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:33,283
Trouble's coming
Better stay in bed

953
01:06:33,354 --> 01:06:36,289
Then I even tried to run away

954
01:06:36,357 --> 01:06:39,155
'Cause I didn't even know
my own strength

955
01:06:39,227 --> 01:06:41,718
I was shocked
No, I couldn't believe

956
01:06:41,796 --> 01:06:44,492
My world rocked
It was news to me

957
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:47,527
When I looked in the mirror today

958
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:49,763
I looked back and I heard me say

959
01:06:49,837 --> 01:06:54,331
I gotta own it, breathe it
Live it like I mean it

960
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:57,276
There's a hero in me
It's all I wanna be

961
01:06:57,345 --> 01:07:00,246
Is someone to rely on
Looks good on TV

962
01:07:00,682 --> 01:07:03,344
Save the day
It's part of the routine

963
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:06,216
Out of my way
This is a job for me

964
01:07:06,287 --> 01:07:09,188
There's a hero in me
It's all I wanna be

965
01:07:09,257 --> 01:07:12,192
Is someone to rely on
Looks good on TV

966
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,888
Save the day
It's part of the routine

967
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:18,194
Out of my way
This is a job for me

968
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:22,092
There's a hero in me, yeah

969
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,704
There's a hero in me

970
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:32,346
The Signal of Strength!

971
01:07:32,413 --> 01:07:35,109
From the uprising plot
in Zoome Time Boome Time?

972
01:07:35,183 --> 01:07:37,674
Dad, it's a good, solid idea.
And it came from you.

973
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:40,550
I don't know. You really think it'll work?

974
01:07:49,097 --> 01:07:50,086
I don't know.

975
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:51,597
I still have to figure out
how to send the signal.

976
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:55,932
But even Tripp says, "If you don't
even try, you'll just wonder why. "

977
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:01,103
You know
who said that first, don't you?

978
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:03,806
You did, when you were eight.

979
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:07,478
It was so smart, so innocent.

980
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:11,382
As soon as you said it,
I knew, "That's how Tripp thinks. "

981
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,447
Tripp? Wait, you're saying...

982
01:08:14,522 --> 01:08:17,252
Melissa, where do you think
he comes from?

983
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:20,488
A writer is only as good
as his own experiences.

984
01:08:20,561 --> 01:08:24,588
The ideas, the plots, the characters,
that's where they come from.

985
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:28,067
When you were born,
so was Tripp Zoome.

986
01:08:28,936 --> 01:08:32,372
I hear whispering!
I don't like whispering!

987
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:40,871
So I'm in your books?

988
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:43,846
Sweetheart, you're everywhere.

989
01:08:44,385 --> 01:08:47,752
You're in the plot. You're in the humor.
You're the heart.

990
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,016
You're my heart.

991
01:08:53,728 --> 01:08:56,219
You're the reason I write, Melissa.

992
01:08:57,065 --> 01:09:00,557
And I'd give it all up tomorrow
if it meant losing you.

993
01:09:05,273 --> 01:09:07,707
What's buzzing, cousin?
How's our little book coming?

994
01:09:07,775 --> 01:09:09,242
- It's coming.
- Good.

995
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,437
Good. Thanks to that firestorm
that's brewing outside,

996
01:09:11,512 --> 01:09:15,073
sooner is gonna be much better
than later, for all of us.

997
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:19,913
You know,
there's something I don't get.

998
01:09:19,987 --> 01:09:21,955
Why do you care what Skunk writes?

999
01:09:22,023 --> 01:09:24,184
What, are you writing a book?

1000
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,725
I'm kidding, it's a...

1001
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:32,296
Look, I don't care what Skunk writes.
I care what your father re-writes!

1002
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:35,001
But my book.
You said...

1003
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:37,060
I said a lot of things.

1004
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:42,141
Wait, did you actually think I gave
a hint of a hoot about your writing?

1005
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:46,306
Please. The back of that cereal box
has a more interesting plot.

1006
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:51,874
Look, the whole plan was, I needed his
writing so I could sell the manuscript

1007
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,818
as a Neal Morris book.

1008
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:58,017
The last Neal Morris book.

1009
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:03,892
Okay, now we have a problem.

1010
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:06,331
The last Neal Morris book means
the last Tripp Zoome book,

1011
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:09,768
and the last Tripp Zoome book means
no more me, Tripp Zoome.

1012
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:11,464
That is not okay!

1013
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:17,076
We'll talk about this later.

1014
01:10:17,145 --> 01:10:20,740
Having your father start
with Skunk's verbal drool

1015
01:10:20,815 --> 01:10:23,283
was just a way to get you fools
to do the dirty work.

1016
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:25,444
Talk about your "dumb thug" character.

1017
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,147
Look, I'm not writing this book for you.

1018
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:29,155
I think you will, big daddy.

1019
01:10:29,223 --> 01:10:33,125
Because until you do,
you won't see your little princess again.

1020
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:37,056
Lock the girl in the bathroom.

1021
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:38,496
Moe.
- Okay, look,

1022
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:39,555
we didn't sign up for this.

1023
01:10:39,634 --> 01:10:43,035
Well, you signed up for something,
and that alone is worth five years in jail

1024
01:10:43,104 --> 01:10:47,939
for you, Maurice, and your little brother.
Now, do it.

1025
01:10:50,778 --> 01:10:52,336
Just come with me.
What? No!

1026
01:10:52,413 --> 01:10:55,348
Just come on. Just... Come on, just...

1027
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:56,849
Here. Sorry.

1028
01:10:59,187 --> 01:11:03,556
Now let's discuss
our little deadline, okay, Neal?

1029
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:07,788
All right, look, I'll do what you want.
Just don't hurt my daughter.

1030
01:11:12,366 --> 01:11:14,300
No signal in my sights yet, Wheeze.

1031
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:15,858
Don't worry, she'll come through.

1032
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:17,802
And then, we strike.

1033
01:11:21,642 --> 01:11:25,578
Okay, think, Melissa.
What would Tripp do?

1034
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:51,570
Come on. Let's burn rubber, Dad!

1035
01:11:52,106 --> 01:11:54,870
Collectors don't actually care
if it's any good,

1036
01:11:54,942 --> 01:11:56,466
just that it's you who writes it.

1037
01:11:56,544 --> 01:11:58,910
You're pathetic, you know that?

1038
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:04,111
I'll keep that in mind,
in case I ever care! Which I won't.

1039
01:12:12,827 --> 01:12:15,387
I really thought I was doing right.

1040
01:12:15,997 --> 01:12:19,228
I just wanted better for you, not this.

1041
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:22,735
It's okay, Moe.

1042
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:27,636
You helped me meet my hero.
He helped me write.

1043
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,140
That's not so bad in my book.

1044
01:12:32,613 --> 01:12:33,807
"My book. "

1045
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:35,510
This way!

1046
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,574
Hey, hold up!
Coming behind you!

1047
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:42,316
Barometric pressure rising.
Wind, one knot north-southeast.

1048
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:51,697
Signal! I see the signal!

1049
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,427
Move, move, move!

1050
01:12:57,271 --> 01:12:59,796
Guys! Guys, I can't see the signal.

1051
01:12:59,874 --> 01:13:02,468
I can't see the signal!
A little help here, please?

1052
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:05,177
- Floss! Floss!
- Floss! Floss!

1053
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:09,148
- Floss! Floss! Floss! Floss!
- Floss! Floss! Floss! Floss!

1054
01:13:13,154 --> 01:13:14,485
Hey, guys!

1055
01:13:16,924 --> 01:13:20,485
- Floss! Floss! Floss! Floss!
- Floss! Floss! Floss! Floss!

1056
01:13:23,297 --> 01:13:24,628
Floss!

1057
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:29,300
All right, everybody,
let's flush them out!

1058
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:32,134
That way, we control
where the flow goes.

1059
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:34,775
You are so Zoome enough.

1060
01:13:36,143 --> 01:13:38,509
Super-stinky cheese bombs ready?

1061
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:40,604
Ready!
- Aim!

1062
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:48,081
Fire!

1063
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:02,726
Let them have it!

1064
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:17,742
All your cavalry's here! That's it!

1065
01:14:17,818 --> 01:14:21,447
Time to make tracks. I'll take him.
You two grab little sis.

1066
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,988
Move it!

1067
01:14:27,395 --> 01:14:28,623
Hurry up!

1068
01:14:35,169 --> 01:14:37,069
What's the matter, Merv? Afraid?

1069
01:14:37,138 --> 01:14:40,073
Of a bunch of sun-deprived
bookworms? Please.

1070
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:46,946
Eat grape juice, loser.

1071
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:56,481
Come on! This will never come out!

1072
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,628
Was that really necessary?

1073
01:15:02,096 --> 01:15:03,358
Floss!
- Run!

1074
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:05,661
- Go get her! Now!
- Run to the top!

1075
01:15:07,134 --> 01:15:09,159
You had better hope
that she doesn't mess this up.

1076
01:15:09,236 --> 01:15:11,397
No, you better hope.
You don't know my daughter.

1077
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:13,372
All right, Zoomers,
let's seal off the streets.

1078
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,636
No one gets in or out. Move!

1079
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:16,870
- Floss!
- Floss!

1080
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:19,777
All right, it's you and me.
We're going in.

1081
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:21,714
Slow down! We won't hurt you!

1082
01:15:21,782 --> 01:15:23,943
Like I'm gonna wait to find that out.

1083
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:26,612
How about a little Slip-Slap Tripp Trap.

1084
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:51,341
Hey, guys.

1085
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:53,770
Impressive.

1086
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:57,973
- You got the clue.
- Yeah, the Signal of Strength. Nice.

1087
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,645
So what do you think? Waxed or mint?

1088
01:16:04,925 --> 01:16:08,019
Now, come on, Merv, don't you think
you're in a little over your head, here?

1089
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:12,429
No. Once we get to my car,
we're home free.

1090
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,000
You know, Skunk,
you're really not a bad writer.

1091
01:16:15,069 --> 01:16:16,593
I know. Just a bad guy, right?

1092
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:19,696
How about a confused,
likable bad guy?

1093
01:16:19,774 --> 01:16:21,537
Come on, my dad.

1094
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:26,972
Hand-holding. Finally!

1095
01:16:35,856 --> 01:16:39,883
Come on, guys, throw me a bone, here.
Tell me where they are.

1096
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:45,326
Charge!

1097
01:17:00,614 --> 01:17:04,710
- This is my last suit! Make them stop!
I don't think I can do it!

1098
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:08,482
I just don't get it! Your plots are so trite!

1099
01:17:23,103 --> 01:17:26,368
Give it up, Merv. It's over.
There's nowhere to go.

1100
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:31,701
Okay, calm down. I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

1101
01:17:39,753 --> 01:17:41,618
We gotta do something, Maurice.

1102
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:43,623
I know, little brother. I know.

1103
01:17:43,691 --> 01:17:45,522
I got it. Spin.

1104
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,552
- What?
- Spin!

1105
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:49,858
Like your life depended on it!

1106
01:18:22,496 --> 01:18:24,657
We're not so bad after all.

1107
01:18:24,732 --> 01:18:25,892
Floss!

1108
01:18:36,977 --> 01:18:38,069
Yeah!

1109
01:18:39,613 --> 01:18:41,672
Are you sure you're okay?

1110
01:18:41,749 --> 01:18:45,185
The best I've ever been, sweetheart.
Just the best.

1111
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:57,019
All right! Thank you. Thank you.

1112
01:18:59,633 --> 01:19:02,727
First off, two mega-important
announcements.

1113
01:19:02,803 --> 01:19:06,603
One, due to your amazingly
Tripp-tastic efforts this morning,

1114
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:10,804
everyone here will receive a free
autographed copy of my next book.

1115
01:19:11,178 --> 01:19:14,705
That's right.
Thank you, thank you. Yes. Yeah.

1116
01:19:15,082 --> 01:19:18,677
Second, there's a little unfinished
business we have to take care of,

1117
01:19:18,752 --> 01:19:20,652
the Zoome Enough Prize.

1118
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:26,889
Knowing about something is great.

1119
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:31,057
But putting that knowledge into action
requires a level of commitment

1120
01:19:31,131 --> 01:19:34,066
that borders on insanity.

1121
01:19:35,235 --> 01:19:39,729
So on that note, please give it up
for my new friends, Andre...

1122
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:43,773
- Floss! Floss! Floss!
- Floss! Floss! Floss!

1123
01:19:43,844 --> 01:19:45,311
Sheldon...

1124
01:19:49,049 --> 01:19:50,914
What's up, Tripp fans?

1125
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:53,110
And Wheeze!

1126
01:19:56,156 --> 01:19:58,886
Thank you. You know, guys,
my parents never got why I was

1127
01:19:58,959 --> 01:20:03,055
so into these books, and
all I gotta say now is, reading rocks.

1128
01:20:05,566 --> 01:20:06,863
Good job.

1129
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:11,366
You know, all that's happened,

1130
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:15,465
I couldn't have done any of it
without you.

1131
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:18,511
But you did. All of it, actually.

1132
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,383
I may be the "who" your dad writes
about, but you, you're the "why. "

1133
01:20:25,953 --> 01:20:27,477
Remember that.

1134
01:20:29,089 --> 01:20:31,023
We've got one more prize.

1135
01:20:31,091 --> 01:20:34,288
Without her, none us would be
standing here today.

1136
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,030
She is my inspiration.

1137
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:40,899
She is the reason I do what I do.

1138
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:43,866
My daughter, Melissa.

1139
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:13,557
- Floss! Floss! Floss! Floss!
- Floss! Floss! Floss! Floss!

1140
01:21:13,634 --> 01:21:17,400
Chin up, Moe. Time's on our side,
even if nobody else is.

1141
01:21:18,338 --> 01:21:21,739
Skunk, that made sense.
And it was clever!

1142
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:26,304
And Dostoyevsky, he wrote some really
cool stuff while he was in the slammer.

1143
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,610
That's my brother. He's a writer!

1144
01:21:35,489 --> 01:21:36,786
- Hey, Neal.
Yes?

1145
01:21:36,857 --> 01:21:39,553
Are you sure you can't stay
another day?

1146
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:42,991
Sorry to get rescued and run,

1147
01:21:43,063 --> 01:21:46,226
but my daughter and I have a vacation
to salvage.

1148
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:47,961
Ready?

1149
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:50,162
I've always been ready, Dad.

1150
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:52,865
Hang on, Melissa.

1151
01:21:54,875 --> 01:22:00,370
Here's my phone number,
in case you want to...

1152
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:09,181
- Go out?
- Yes. Yeah.

1153
01:22:09,256 --> 01:22:12,054
Yeah, yeah, actually, that'd be...
That'd be great.

1154
01:22:12,126 --> 01:22:14,822
Okay.
You just have to promise me one thing.

1155
01:22:15,162 --> 01:22:16,993
Anything. Anything at all.

1156
01:22:17,064 --> 01:22:19,430
It's gotta be a normal date.
Just you and me.

1157
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,368
No guys in weird costumes.
No mentho-dental floss.

1158
01:22:23,837 --> 01:22:25,737
No police intervention.

1159
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:27,637
I promise.

1160
01:22:28,242 --> 01:22:29,334
Yeah!

1161
01:22:42,723 --> 01:22:45,624
Bombs ready? Aim!

1162
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:47,558
Fire!

1163
01:22:55,969 --> 01:22:57,766
This is just perfect.

1164
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,202
Incoming!

1165
01:23:03,043 --> 01:23:04,704
Come on!

1166
01:23:06,513 --> 01:23:08,344
Eat grape juice, loser.

1167
01:23:10,517 --> 01:23:12,951
Come on! This will never come out!

1168
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,616
Found the brake.

1169
01:23:20,994 --> 01:23:23,724
This is my last suit! Make them stop!

1170
01:23:24,565 --> 01:23:27,762
Merv Kilbo and his trusty ragtop
are on the case.
