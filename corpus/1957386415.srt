1
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,749
Fly's unzipped, Jack.

2
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:38,499
Made you look!

3
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,025
You are the only
pitcher we've got,

4
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,943
and I'm in charge, and
you're going to be there.

5
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,775
Martoni's got an arm,
use him for Pete's sake.

6
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:27,842
Martoni!

7
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,677
Social services has not beaten
parking regulations

8
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,134
in 4 labor days straight.

9
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,634
I'm sick and tired of it.

10
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:35,717
I'm sick and tired

11
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:36,776
of the tone
you're taking with me.

12
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,133
I'm not a kid.
I don't need a lecture,

13
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:40,967
especially about some
idiotic softball game.

14
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,883
This is not
about a softball game.

15
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,093
Then what's it about?

16
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:47,883
It's about this...

17
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
And what's that?

18
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:54,782
That's the reaction
I get from you

19
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,216
every time I make some comment
about how you do your job.

20
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,817
It's a reaction that
says you know it all,

21
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:01,925
you've done it all, and
I am about the biggest cross

22
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:05,884
any social services supervisor
has ever had to bear.

23
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,925
Well...

24
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,550
Ok, I'm sorry.

25
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,591
Yeah, well, saying
the words and meaning them

26
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:12,692
are 2 very different things.

27
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,111
Look, the point is,
I may or may not

28
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,716
be at the labor day
softball game.

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,466
Why, where are you going to be?

30
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:21,716
Are you leaving, Jack?

31
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,591
No!

32
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,550
Rena and I may go somewhere.

33
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,591
We haven't done that in a while.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,842
All right...

35
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:34,009
I'd better make sure
I've got their names straight.

36
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,136
Norman bulanksy?

37
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,717
Norman may not be there.

38
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:40,984
He works at the doughnut shop.

39
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,360
If things are slow,
they let him off early,

40
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:43,734
but if he has
to work a full shift,

41
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,049
he won't get back
to the house on time.

42
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:47,715
Arnold wiggins?

43
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,633
What day is today?

44
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:50,757
Tuesday.

45
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:52,650
He works Wednesdays and
Saturdays at the movie theater

46
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:56,092
as a janitor, so for better
or for worse, he'll be there.

47
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:58,092
Sounds like you don't like him.

48
00:03:58,175 --> 00:03:59,466
I like him fine,

49
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,134
but he can be a handful.
They all can.

50
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:04,217
Lucien p. Singer?

51
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,360
Lucien works mornings
at the training center,

52
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:07,757
so he'll be there.

53
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,050
So, Norman and Lucien
are developmentally disabled,

54
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,134
and Arnold is manic-d.

55
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,591
How's his medication?

56
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:14,591
Good.

57
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:15,300
Good.

58
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,008
When he remembers to take it.

59
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:19,175
Uh, what about Barry Klemper?

60
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,717
Well, if the other guys
are fender benders,

61
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:27,967
Barry's the Hindenburg coming in
for a fast landing.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,675
Uh-oh.

63
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:34,758
What? Problem?

64
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,485
Well, there are
new people moving in,

65
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,050
so I got to fill them in on my
boys and what they're about.

66
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:41,675
But I should also be there with
you when you go in the house.

67
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,175
Jack, I've done this before,

68
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,716
I've done this
a bunch of times before.

69
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,234
Well, you should probably
wait for me here.

70
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:52,925
They get a little insecure
when things change.

71
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,715
Jack, I'll be fine
with your boys,

72
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:57,883
you go take care of the new kids
on the block.

73
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,591
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,050
Hi. I'm Jack Palmer.

75
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,551
I work with the social services
department.

76
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:08,968
Hi. Joan Moore.

77
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,151
Just wanted to have a word with
you about your next door-neighbors.

78
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,549
Oh, sure!

79
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,151
Do you know anything
about breakfast cereals?

80
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:16,675
I have 9 boxes of breakfast
cereals and 7 heads of lettuce,

81
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:18,027
and I think
it could be a problem.

82
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,092
I think it could be
a rea problem.

83
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,591
Arnold?

84
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:24,676
Let's slow down, ok?

85
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:28,610
Today I went to the market
at the end of the street

86
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:30,114
because I wanted
to get some wheaties,

87
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,610
but I couldn't remember whether
I wanted one box or more boxes,

88
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:34,675
so I asked the manager
how many boxes I should get,

89
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:36,359
"just for you?" He said.
"Yes, sir," I said.

90
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,091
"17," he said.
"Thank you," I said.

91
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,050
But, and this is the part
I want to emphasize,

92
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:41,758
I could only find 9 boxes.

93
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,842
So, what could I do?

94
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,401
I bought... well, I bought
the 9 boxes of wheaties,

95
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,966
and I bought 7 heads of lettuce,
that made 16,

96
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:48,651
and a bag of charcoal
briquettes, that made 17.

97
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:51,008
So, you see, at least
I got the right number.

98
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,925
What's them?

99
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:53,883
They be a lot.

100
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:54,968
Hello, Lucien.

101
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:57,633
She's very smart,
she's Jack's friend.

102
00:05:57,716 --> 00:05:58,716
You be Jack's Rena?

103
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:02,133
No, Lucien, Rena is Jack's wife.

104
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,841
We met her, don't you remember?

105
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:04,842
Rena's white.

106
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:07,675
People change.

107
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,675
Did you tell her?

108
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:10,675
Would you be quiet?

109
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:11,818
We're not going to tell her

110
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:15,175
before we tell Jack,
for heaven's sake!

111
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:22,842
So, they're all wonderful,
harmless, dear guys.

112
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,110
The whole neighborhood
loves them.

113
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,134
I just wanted you to know

114
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,484
there's nothing
to be concerned about.

115
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,026
Yeah, I'm sure that
it's all very well meant,

116
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,591
I just don't know how Burt is
going to feel about all that.

117
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,675
Careful, careful!

118
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:32,716
Oh, Burt's my husband.

119
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:33,842
I figured.

120
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:35,007
Yeah, and he's really...

121
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,967
He's a traditional
kind of a man,

122
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,259
and I just don't think
he's going to be too happy

123
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:42,924
about living next door
to retarded people.

124
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:46,007
Mrs. Warren,
the word "retarded"...

125
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:48,026
Oh, well, you know, I'm
really the rebel in the family.

126
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,968
I'm the only woman I know who
really gets the three stooges.

127
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,508
I got this.

128
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,342
Oh, it's your library card.

129
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,049
It's very nice.

130
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,633
You see my name?

131
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:04,759
Yes, it says Lucien Singer.
I see it right there.

132
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:10,175
Lucien p. Singer,
and I mean business!

133
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:14,259
So, if I'm not at the day
number, try the other one.

134
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,633
There's a machine on both.

135
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:16,716
Ok.

136
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:18,068
Honestly, call me any time,
all right?

137
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:19,092
Mom! - Yeah?

138
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:20,236
They put Devon in the kitchen!

139
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,634
Can't I have him in my room?

140
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:25,344
Devon is the hamster, and he's a
very important person around here.

141
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:26,427
Mom!

142
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:28,109
Yes, yes, you can have
Devon in your room,

143
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:30,067
and I'm going to come right now
and help you move him.

144
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,091
Ok, bye.

145
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:31,924
All right,
thanks a lot, Mrs. Warner,

146
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,007
good to meet you.

147
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,674
Yeah, ok. Here I come!

148
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:38,133
Thank you.

149
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:54,174
I stopped enough I think.

150
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:02,175
Arnold, there has
to be an explanation.

151
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:05,134
How on earth did you wind up
with all this stuff?

152
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,218
Buying books, Jack.

153
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:07,902
You said it's smart,
you're the one who said so.

154
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:10,046
Wheaties and lettuce,
your kind of new taste treat.

155
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,674
Department of agriculture
yearbook, 1948,

156
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:19,217
department of agriculture
yearbook, 1949, 1950, 1951.

157
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,632
You have to study agriculture
in a set, year by year.

158
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:28,883
Otherwise,
it don't make no sense.

159
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,008
The man took advantage
of you, Arnold.

160
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:32,276
They have to go back
to the store.

161
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,342
Look, I asked a girl
in line about it, Jack.

162
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,216
I forget exactly what she said,

163
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,258
but she was
very thorough about it!

164
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,222
People take advantage of you,
it's not right.

165
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:42,258
Now, the food has to go back.

166
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:44,508
It's easy for you to say!

167
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,466
Arnold...

168
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:49,545
Did you take your medication?

169
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:53,175
There's a fine line between
caring and nagging, Jack.

170
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:56,426
You're very close to the line.

171
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,425
Oh, boy. The bus
sure was crowded.

172
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,175
I had to sit up front
with old people.

173
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:04,217
One of those old people said,
"how are you today?"

174
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,175
Oh, boy. I hate those questions.

175
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,259
Whose wheaties?

176
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:08,651
You had to mention them,
didn't you?

177
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:09,983
You couldn't just ignore them,
could you, Norman?

178
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,551
You couldn't just ignore.

179
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,301
Hi, Norman.

180
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:15,259
Oh, Jack! Hi, Jack, how are you?

181
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:17,800
The job's going great.
Nice to see you.

182
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:21,799
Well, I'd better get to bed,
I'm real sleepy.

183
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,715
That bus... oh, boy...
Was it ever crowded.

184
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,316
I had to sit up front
with the old people.

185
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,550
I need a good night's sleep,
so good night, everyone!

186
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:29,633
Come again!

187
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,466
What's that
under your shirt, Norman?

188
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,384
Oh, boy. Do I have
something under my shirt?

189
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,675
I'm really glad you told me.
What could it be?

190
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:43,592
The suspense is killing us.

191
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:47,259
Doughnuts!

192
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:48,800
I didn't even notice! Doughnuts!

193
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:51,049
Hey, Norman.

194
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,591
This ain't Jack's wife.

195
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:54,800
Did you tell Jack yet?

196
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:56,591
Lucien, you're supposed
to be quiet,

197
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:58,196
you're going to give away
the surprise!

198
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:03,260
Hey.

199
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:07,091
Hey! Listen to me.

200
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,092
Norman, ditch the doughnuts.

201
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,776
Tell me what?
What did you have to tell me?

202
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,651
I don't have any idea
what he's talking about.

203
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:14,799
Jack, Jack, I'll
put them in the fridge, Jack.

204
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,008
You know, for later.

205
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,691
No, Norman, I don't want you
snacking off of those things

206
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:21,174
or I'll take your keys.

207
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:26,675
Jack. Jack, I... I need my keys.

208
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,507
I need my keys
to get into things.

209
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,383
Keys are pretty important
in the doughnut line, Jack.

210
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,590
Oh, don't be such a bragger.

211
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:37,924
We need lots of keys
in the movie business, too.

212
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:41,151
Hello, my name is Norman
Bulansky, welcome to my home!

213
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:42,050
Norman!

214
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:43,008
Norman, wait!

215
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,508
Get rid of the doughnuts.

216
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:45,984
And, Arnold,
make your peace with it.

217
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:47,716
That stuff has to go back
to the store.

218
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,717
Oh, Jack!

219
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,883
Hello?

220
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:50,550
Hi. - Hello.

221
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,384
We're here to see the house.

222
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,133
I'm sorry?

223
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:54,483
Tell him, tell him, tell him!

224
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:56,551
Shh, Lucien, be quiet!

225
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,384
Just one second.

226
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,466
Tell me what?

227
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:04,301
We're going to sell
the house, Jack!

228
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:06,426
Lucien, you don't own the house.

229
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,777
Jack, it doesn't matter, uh...

230
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,966
This is not the way
we wanted you to find out,

231
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,091
but that's plans for you.

232
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,110
We were going to have this
big surprise party for you,

233
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:14,384
but, hey, that's plans.

234
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,715
What are you talking about?

235
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,299
Jack, we got millions!

236
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,383
Look! See?

237
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:19,858
Arnold wiggins is
the winner of $10 million

238
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:21,723
when he returns the winning
sweepstakes number!

239
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:22,842
$10 million, Jack!

240
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,650
The first thing I'm going
to do is buy a ticket to Russia,

241
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:26,858
that's where Tchaikovsky
comes from.

242
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:27,883
Who's chakopski?

243
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,151
The greatest composer
since Neil Sedaka.

244
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,425
Arnold, you can't use this.

245
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:33,692
Uh, there was a "for sale" card

246
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,193
down on the stop and shop
bulletin board?

247
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:37,715
If we're going to have
a party, I've got the doughnuts!

248
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,466
We'll just take a peek
at the kitchen.

249
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,384
Doughnut?

250
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,507
Uh, no, thanks.

251
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,590
Arnold, listen to me,

252
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:43,859
you have to have
the winning numbers.

253
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,204
Well, we're going to return it!

254
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:46,484
What do you think, I'm going to
hang onto the winning number?

255
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:47,668
Arnold, stop for a second.

256
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:51,384
Hey, Jack! How many rubles
is $10 million!?

257
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,050
Arnold! Stop!

258
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:54,968
Jack?

259
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,591
When will I have the opportunity

260
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,592
to meet the other gentleman
who lives here?

261
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:02,591
Mr. Klemper,
I think his name is.

262
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:08,589
Do any of you guys know when
Barry's going to be back here?

263
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:11,092
He be teaching.

264
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:14,049
He's a good teacher.

265
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,715
Mr. Klemper is a teacher?

266
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,967
Mm-hmm.

267
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,092
What does he teach?

268
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:25,507
Again, Mrs. Fremus, again.

269
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,384
Again what?

270
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,134
Swing and miss again?

271
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,175
We're not always in control.

272
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,939
Isn't there some advice
you can give me?

273
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,235
Isn't that what a teacher
is supposed to do?

274
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,134
It's not important
that I teach, Mrs. Fremus.

275
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,967
What's important
is that you learn.

276
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,465
Again.

277
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,924
Uh!

278
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:48,341
Heh heh.

279
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:51,342
Barry's not like the other guys.

280
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,384
He's pretty much into himself.

281
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:54,633
He's a grade-a schizophrenic,

282
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,424
he's got a history
of institutions,

283
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:58,260
his family has written him off.

284
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:02,049
He's on the edge of falling off
the edge of the world.

285
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,151
But he's very resourceful.

286
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,455
What's that mean, resourceful?

287
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:07,591
He's pretty much convinced
himself he's a golf pro.

288
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:10,966
He copes better than most
with his level of illness.

289
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:14,217
At what cost down the line,
I don't know.

290
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,008
Sounds like a test.

291
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:18,174
They're all a test.

292
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,049
The question on the test
that matters is...

293
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:21,799
Yeah?

294
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,591
Whether or not I'm passing.

295
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:28,341
All right, Mrs. Fremus.

296
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,133
What are you looking at?

297
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,216
The ball.

298
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,883
Aspire to greatness,
Mrs. Fremus,

299
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,590
aspire to greatness!

300
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:40,300
Excuse me?

301
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,300
Look at a dimple on the ball.

302
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:46,342
One specific dimple on the ball.

303
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,801
Pick out one specific
dimple and zero in!

304
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:55,592
With bifocals, this isn't
a walk in the park, you know.

305
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:58,383
There's our guy.

306
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,715
Who's the lady?

307
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,966
Mrs. Fremus. She's
a widow lady I set him up with.

308
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,383
Mrs. Fremus, I'm disappointed.

309
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:11,485
How do you think I feel?

310
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,342
Did I tell you to swing?

311
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:13,967
No.

312
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,379
And did you hit the ball?

313
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:16,425
No.

314
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:16,841
There's a connection,
Mrs. Fremus.

315
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:18,400
These things are interrelated.

316
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,882
It is time for my soap.

317
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:21,715
Mrs. Fremus...

318
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:25,465
I agreed to be your student
because you are a nice boy.

319
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,135
And I was told
you needed students.

320
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:29,300
Fine, I will take
another lesson tomorrow,

321
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,758
but Mary Fremus
does not miss her soap.

322
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:34,550
Not for you or anybody.

323
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,175
Hello, Mrs. Fremus.

324
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,051
Mrs. Oh!

325
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,424
Hey, Barry.

326
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,882
Hey, Jack, how's the man?

327
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,728
Good. I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

328
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,715
Hello, Barry, I'm Mrs. Tracy,
I work with Jack.

329
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:51,175
Well, you're out of luck,
I'm totally booked up.

330
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,674
At the donut shop I found

331
00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:59,592
a magazine in the men's room

332
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,497
you don't know what
was in there.

333
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:03,341
What? What was in there?

334
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,341
I be lookin at my books.

335
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:08,882
There were girls in there

336
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:11,799
with... oh boy... nothing on!

337
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:13,841
I mean, oh boy, nothing!

338
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:16,967
Nothing?
You really mean nothing?

339
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,716
One girl was in the snow.

340
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,716
She, she had nothing on.

341
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,549
In the snow with nothing on?

342
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,757
She had a hat.

343
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,591
And that's all?

344
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,091
It be a set.

345
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,092
And those big shoes

346
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:34,175
like, like giant tennis rackets.

347
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,508
You've got to get
the set year by year.

348
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:40,925
That's the way they teach
it in agriculture.

349
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,842
Boy Sheila be too smart
to go in the snow

350
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:44,925
without clothes on.

351
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:46,008
Who's Sheila?

352
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,217
The girl I dance with sometimes

353
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:49,299
at the community center.

354
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:52,383
I'm... I'm gonna ask Jack
if I can bring Sheila over here.

355
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,091
Alone?

356
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,590
Norman, he won't let ya.

357
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:58,675
I've already asked.

358
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:02,384
You asked if you could have
Sally fields come over.

359
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:04,925
Ya, well he still said no
and fair is fair. Besides,

360
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:06,901
isn't Sheila the one who
said you're too fat?

361
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:11,589
Well, she's not no skinny
mini herself you know...

362
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:15,383
Barry!

363
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:17,882
Born in a barn, born in a barn.

364
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:21,384
I got barns in my books.

365
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:25,384
Aah! There's a rat,
there's a rat!

366
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,717
There's a rat! There's a rat!

367
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:30,843
It carries the plague!

368
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:33,383
Turn off the lights,
it can't see in the dark!

369
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:42,591
I think we be needing
to call Jack.

370
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,650
TV announcer: Across the 40,
down to the 30...

371
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:54,342
Yes, Lucien's sweet
and likable, granted, but...

372
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:58,341
No, he loves people. I'm sure
he'll present himself very well,

373
00:16:58,424 --> 00:16:59,424
but he's fragile,

374
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:01,235
and this is going to put
a lot of pressure on him, so...

375
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,841
Yes, it's your decision to make,
I understand that.

376
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:05,591
Uh-huh.

377
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,216
Hang on a sec.
I got another call.

378
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,508
I'm sorry. Hold on.

379
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:11,758
Hello?

380
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:14,342
Yes, it is.

381
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:17,384
Yeah, ok, I'll tell her.

382
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:19,049
Dr. Racine...

383
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,299
00 on Tuesday, got it.

384
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,424
Ok, thank you. Bye.

385
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,175
Hi, I'm back.

386
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,235
Listen, if this thing
with Lucien is a done deal,

387
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:30,318
just tell me and I'll do
what I have to do, 'cause...

388
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,759
I'm sorry, here we go again.
I feel like a bookie. Hang on.

389
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:36,300
Hello?

390
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:37,843
Lucien?

391
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:38,717
We got a rat!

392
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:39,801
There's a riot?

393
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:42,675
A rat, a rat,
a big fat ugly one!

394
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:45,549
A rat, a rodent,
a plague-carrier, Jack!

395
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:49,632
Jack! I'm putting out
doughnuts for bait, Jack!

396
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:50,800
Hey, Jack?

397
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,733
Don't you think it would be
a good idea if we had a plan?

398
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:54,360
Don't you think
that would be a good idea?

399
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:55,384
There he goes!

400
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:57,799
Catch it, kill it,

401
00:17:57,882 --> 00:17:59,084
flush it, and do not bother me

402
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:01,050
with this kind of stuff
at my home ever again!

403
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:03,341
Catch it, kill it, flush it.

404
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:06,217
Ok, thank you, Jack!

405
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:10,633
Hi, I'm back, sorry.

406
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,299
Hello? Hello?

407
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,008
Hello... hello?

408
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:22,883
Well, I guess it's a done deal.

409
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,134
What's a done deal?

410
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,277
They want Lucien to testify
before a State Senate committee

411
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:29,507
that's talking about
budget cuts for the program.

412
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,384
He'd be scared stiff.

413
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:35,341
Hey, are you ok?

414
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:36,507
Why wouldn't I be ok?

415
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:40,133
Well, you have an appointment
with a Dr. Racine Tuesday.

416
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:41,508
He just called to confirm.

417
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:42,591
We...

418
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,674
We have an appointment
with Dr. Racine.

419
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,842
He's a shrink,
a marriage counselor.

420
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:49,841
A marriage counselor?

421
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:53,966
When you're here,
you're not here.

422
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,258
Physically, we're just a memory.

423
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:56,883
Not so.

424
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:57,967
Yes, so.

425
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,441
To prove it, there's the small
matter of a birthday

426
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:02,632
that got totally and
completely forgotten.

427
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,883
So you want to go see
a marriage counselor

428
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,508
because I forgot your birthday?

429
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,550
Not mine, yours.

430
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,925
Happy birthday.

431
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,342
I love you.

432
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:28,759
I hope it fits.

433
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:42,923
There! He's there!

434
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:48,258
He's caught. He's trapped.
He's a big one.

435
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:49,585
Norman, what are you doing?

436
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,842
Rats can't see in the dark.
It's a behavior pattern.

437
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,925
He be drugged.

438
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:55,318
We need a plan!
We need an airtight plan!

439
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,217
Norman, turn off the light!

440
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,110
Lucien, count to 3
and then close the door,

441
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:02,092
but don't let the rat
know where you are.

442
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,507
I be home.

443
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,590
We know where you are.

444
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:05,859
Don't let the rat
know where you are.

445
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:08,425
Tell him you're not home.

446
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,716
I be not home!

447
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,384
Lucien, shut the door!

448
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,259
Ok.

449
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:15,008
There he goes!

450
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,882
I got him!

451
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:35,674
Ow!

452
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,235
What happened? Did he bite you?

453
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,384
No, I fell on my keys.

454
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:43,632
Check it out. Did you get
him or did you not get him?

455
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,383
Ahh.

456
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:49,008
He's still movin'!

457
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:53,508
Die! Die!

458
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,924
Stop!

459
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:59,925
Check it out. We may
be into overkill here.

460
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,008
Mm. Aah.

461
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:08,967
Oh, boy. Mm.

462
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,632
Ooh. - We got him.

463
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:12,424
We got the rat.

464
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:14,758
We got the rat.

465
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:15,842
He was a brave rat.

466
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:20,633
He died an honorable,
brave rat's death.

467
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:22,966
Jack said we should flush him.

468
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,966
Jack did say "flush him."

469
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:50,465
Well, somebody
ought to say something.

470
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:57,466
Lord, here come the rat.

471
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,133
Arnold, anyone
who can flush a rat

472
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:28,842
can do just about anything.

473
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:32,924
You're right. A person
who can flush a rat

474
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:35,092
oughta be able to do
just about anything,

475
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:38,090
even return groceries.

476
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:41,965
Maybe.

477
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:48,925
I know
all about testifying, Jack.

478
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:50,550
No, this isn't
the kind of testifying

479
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,092
you do in church, Lucien.

480
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:54,259
This is testifying
for the State Senate.

481
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:55,591
What's the state's net?

482
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,800
State Senate, Lucien.
It's a group of people

483
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:00,925
who are interested
in how you're doin'.

484
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:02,128
They just wanna talk to you,

485
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,299
hear what you have to say.

486
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,342
Is Rena gonna be there?

487
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,800
No. She got a happy smile.

488
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:09,674
No, Rena's got
a lot of stuff goin' on.

489
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:12,342
She'll be happy to hear what
you had to say about her smile.

490
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,465
Can I sing the alphabet song?

491
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:15,300
Uh-huh.

492
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:16,384
I got it good.

493
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:18,465
I know that, pal.
You got that down pat.

494
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:20,651
Hey, you'll get
to wear your tie.

495
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,298
Not that tie. It's a clip-on,

496
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:25,464
and Barry says only
babies wear the clip-on ties.

497
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:27,341
Ok, we'll get you
a grown-up tie, then.

498
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:28,757
Can I have a spider-man tie?

499
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,800
Yeah. - I really
want a spider-man tie.

500
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:33,757
Spider-man tie it is.

501
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:37,342
Ok, 1, 2, 3, go.

502
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:38,757
All right.

503
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:41,926
Jack?

504
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:43,716
Yeah?

505
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,050
You have to tie it for me.

506
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:25,757
Thanks a lot.
I'll check with Tom.

507
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:27,633
Excuse me.

508
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,757
I can take you over here, sir.

509
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:40,815
Can you believe
this weather we're having?

510
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:43,383
Oh, I swear. Winter comes
here sooner every year.

511
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:46,466
Everybody in my home says
it's just my imagination.

512
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,925
How you doin' today?

513
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:50,384
Uh, f-fine.

514
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,467
Way to go.

515
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:54,966
Gee, you sure like
your breakfast cereal.

516
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,841
You must be looking
to corner the market.

517
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:08,526
Not one of the people
at the driving range

518
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,234
asked to be one of
my students... not one...

519
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,258
And I'm very obviously there as a
resource to these people, you know?

520
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,007
It's very obvious.

521
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,299
I be your student if you want.

522
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,543
I don't think it's ethical.

523
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,174
Doctors don't operate
on their own...

524
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:24,342
Jack got me talkin'
to the state's net.

525
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:26,341
Maybe I can talk to them

526
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,925
about my golf.

527
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:29,008
Mail call.

528
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:32,466
"Occupant... occupant...

529
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,341
"Resident... Arnold
wiggins' yachting magazine.

530
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:39,049
What you doin' here, Norman?

531
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,133
You 'posed to be at work.

532
00:25:40,424 --> 00:25:42,882
I can't practice dancin'
in the doughnut shop.

533
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,716
Sheila and me are
gonna dance tonight.

534
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,299
I'll play the radio
in my room and practice.

535
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:52,050
Jack got me practicin'
for the state's net.

536
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,050
Yeah. Oh, and Barry Klemper.

537
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:57,050
Comes from somebody
named Klemper, too.

538
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,801
Boy, what are the odds on that?

539
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,382
Oh.

540
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:02,048
Can I have the stamp

541
00:26:02,506 --> 00:26:03,090
when you're through with it?

542
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:06,924
Can I? Barry?

543
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:12,756
That was a Marilyn Monroe.

544
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,466
I don't have
any Marilyn monroes.

545
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,882
Oh, boy, Bologna.

546
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,007
You gonna finish that?

547
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,800
Barry's student, hello!

548
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:45,091
Hello! Merry Christmas!
Hey there.

549
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:45,758
Yoo-hoo!

550
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,425
If you're Barry's student...

551
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:48,050
I am.

552
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,342
He won't be here. He...

553
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,817
He left a yellow
sticky note on the door

554
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:51,757
asking me to come find
his student and tell 'em...

555
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,633
And that is against the law.

556
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:57,465
Missing a lesson
is against the law?

557
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,189
That's worse than
Russia. It's much worse.

558
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:03,217
Taking a shopping cart off of
supermarket property is against the law.

559
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,091
There's even a little sign
in the front

560
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:06,214
that says that very thing.

561
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:08,757
It's like parking
in a handicapped space.

562
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:11,966
People nowadays just don't care.

563
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,882
Oh, my goodness.

564
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,217
Oh, dear.

565
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,966
Oh, oh, dear.

566
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:29,175
Oh. Do you happen to like soaps?

567
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,923
What's your favorite one?

568
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:34,550
Lifebuoy.

569
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:43,384
He went right on down

570
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,842
just like toilet paper.

571
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:49,465
I was tellin' Jack
about our rat.

572
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:51,301
Oh, boy. We couldn't
have caught him,

573
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:52,841
but we turned the lights out.

574
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:53,924
That... that blinds 'em.

575
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,942
Well, you guys had
some kind of busy night.

576
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,382
And today, and today.

577
00:27:58,465 --> 00:27:59,525
Why, what happened today?

578
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,216
Oh! Oh, Barry got a letter.

579
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:02,966
Letter made Barry sad.

580
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,673
I've not been sad.
I've been poignant.

581
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:07,675
It's a poignant thing when a
father comes to see his son.

582
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:10,966
Your dad's comin'
to see you, Barry?

583
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,151
Hey! - Your father's comin'!

584
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:14,549
You didn't tell us...
Don't have a cow.

585
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,425
It's... it's fine
that he's coming.

586
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:17,817
He's just...
He's a very busy man...

587
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:21,382
But he sends me candy
every year on my birthday.

588
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:22,650
And it always
gets there on time.

589
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:25,882
It's just... don't...
Don't... don't have a cow.

590
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,758
It's just my dad
comin' to see me

591
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:28,882
when his schedule permits.

592
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:32,425
Dads love their sons.
Sons love their dads.

593
00:28:32,508 --> 00:28:35,342
It's not a historical event.

594
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:36,799
My dad is coming to see his son.

595
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,133
So blah, blah, blah. That's so...

596
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:43,758
So it is a nice thing.

597
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:47,591
We shall see what we shall see.

598
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:51,966
And I'm gonna
dance with Sheila tonight.

599
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,133
And she's a lucky girl.

600
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:58,383
Ya gotta boogie.
Ya gotta rock 'n' roll.

601
00:28:58,465 --> 00:28:59,466
Come on, guys.

602
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:05,091
Oh, and Arnold took his
groceries back to the store.

603
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:09,048
Arnold, is that true?

604
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,800
You took the stuff back?

605
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,049
It's true.

606
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:17,299
I took the groceries
back to the store.

607
00:29:17,383 --> 00:29:19,258
What?

608
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,217
Come on, Lucien.
Time's a-wastin'.

609
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,134
Time's a-wastin'.

610
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,842
Come on. Don't be a slowpoke.

611
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:31,217
Arnold, I'm proud of you.

612
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:35,883
Rena gonna
be there tonight, Jack?

613
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:36,967
I hope so.

614
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,883
Jack...

615
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,175
Seat belts.

616
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:39,800
Seat belts.

617
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:43,175
Rena always smell nice.

618
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,465
Lucien?

619
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,549
Hmm?

620
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,092
When you're right, you're right.

621
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:07,590
You guys keep your noses clean.

622
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:08,733
That means behave yourselves.

623
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:11,092
Stay out of trouble.
I'll be right back.

624
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:13,217
Jack. Hey, Jack.

625
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,508
Hey. Second man: All right.

626
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:19,673
All right.

627
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,716
There. There. That one.

628
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,299
I danced with her 2 weeks ago.

629
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:29,925
We did the bunny hop twice.

630
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:31,341
Oh, boy. I like the bunny hop.

631
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:34,008
It's... it's like aerobics on TV.

632
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,756
There's Freddy Galanzo.

633
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,758
He thinks he's Robert
Goulet or somebody.

634
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:41,174
Ever since he got sneakers
with a stripe on 'em,

635
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:42,757
he thinks he's Robert Goulet.

636
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:43,881
Who's Robert Goulet?

637
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:47,133
Just the greatest dancer
who ever lived, that's all.

638
00:31:57,924 --> 00:31:59,632
Barry?

639
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:01,091
Ya.

640
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:03,384
Maybe I could golf.

641
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:04,716
Ya.

642
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,590
I killed a rat.

643
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,340
Killing rats and playing golf

644
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:09,704
are totally two
different things.

645
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:14,675
Well, maybe not
totally different.

646
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:38,632
Hey Norman, there's Sheila.

647
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:43,666
Norman, I said there's Sheila.

648
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:46,342
I hear you. I'm not blind.

649
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:08,384
I'll tell you what. I'll
talk to you before I leave.

650
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:13,133
Hi, Sheila.

651
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,715
Hi, Jack.

652
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:14,882
How's it goin' with...

653
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:16,133
Jack. - Heh heh.

654
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:16,882
Hey, Bruce.

655
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:17,925
Hi, Jack. - Hi, Carolyn.

656
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,133
Hi, Jack.

657
00:33:19,216 --> 00:33:21,341
Hi.

658
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:22,758
Hey.

659
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,925
Hey.

660
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,800
We should probably dance, huh?

661
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:40,632
Hey, James.

662
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,299
Hey, Jack. Put it there.

663
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:43,548
Ha ha.

664
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:46,341
You guys are dancin'.

665
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:54,133
So have you decided yet?

666
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:56,550
Decided what?

667
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,799
Whether this is
the saddest place on earth

668
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:01,216
or the happiest.

669
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:04,883
Disneyland is the
happiest place on earth.

670
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:07,674
This isn't Disneyland.

671
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:17,134
Just a second.

672
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:20,342
Hi.

673
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,090
Hey, Norman. Where's Arnold?

674
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:25,756
Bathroom. Number one.

675
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,424
How come you're not
dancing with Sheila?

676
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:30,774
She wants my keys, Jack.
Every time we dance,

677
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:33,507
she asks about gettin' my keys.

678
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,816
I need my keys
to get into things.

679
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,050
Norman, what if you
gave your keys to Jack

680
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,924
just to hold while
you dance with Sheila?

681
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:42,217
She can't expect you
to give her your keys

682
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,549
if you don't have them on you.

683
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:53,134
Jack, she's smart enough
to be doing final jeopardy.

684
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,216
Hi, Sheila.

685
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,091
Hi, Norman.

686
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,216
Hi, Sheila. - Hi, Norman.

687
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:42,757
Hello, my name
is Norman Bulansky.

688
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:43,549
Welcome to my dance.

689
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,549
Hi, Norman. Your shirt is nice.

690
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:51,134
Oh. It... it's
my doughnut shop shirt.

691
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,091
Wanna dance? - Wanna dance?

692
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:21,465
Watch out for that faucet.

693
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:22,049
Arnold.

694
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:23,715
What? Ooh, Jack, Jack,

695
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:24,817
the faucet in the bathroom,

696
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,382
it just... it went crazy.
It exploded.

697
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:27,382
There's water everywhere.

698
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:28,715
Great. - Oh, Jack, stop.

699
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:29,818
What? I gotta take care of it.

700
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:31,150
Stop. No, Jack,
don't you get it?

701
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:31,757
What?

702
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:33,134
It's perfect.

703
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:34,258
This is just perfect.

704
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:35,341
What happened?

705
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,881
Let me tell you what I did.

706
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,007
I went to the bathroom.

707
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:40,091
I was careful as always,

708
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:41,483
and I even remembered
to wash my hands,

709
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:43,424
but a couple of drops
went down my pants.

710
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:45,966
That happens to guys
sometimes, Arnold.

711
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:48,174
But Jack, it made me
deeply nervous.

712
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:49,360
So I went into one of the stalls

713
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:51,216
to wait for 'em
to kinda, you know, dry.

714
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:53,590
But get this, Jack. My
pants... they wouldn't dry.

715
00:36:53,674 --> 00:36:56,591
I mean, they must be some
kind of chemical or somethin'.

716
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,091
They wouldn't dry, though.

717
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,383
So I got this great idea.

718
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,817
I figured if I splashed
water all over myself

719
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:04,299
people wouldn't think
it was pee.

720
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:06,507
They would think
it was somethin' else.

721
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,841
So, so far, I've told 4 people

722
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:10,757
that the water only is
an explosion and not pee.

723
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:13,383
I've had great results.

724
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:22,673
My sister says
to dance real good,

725
00:37:22,756 --> 00:37:27,341
you gotta make-believe
you're some kind of flower.

726
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,589
An African violet in the sink.

727
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:35,007
And you know what
flower I would be?

728
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,384
Oh boy, let me guess.

729
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:39,049
Ah... an African violet?

730
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:42,383
I don't know.

731
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:45,881
Gotta be some kinda flower
to dance real good.

732
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,134
Lucien can I...

733
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,924
Can I tell you something

734
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:03,758
personal something just
between us?

735
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:05,091
I mean, a secret?

736
00:38:05,174 --> 00:38:09,341
Norman he be eatin
donuts all the time.

737
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:12,798
My dad coming here,

738
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,756
my dad scares me
something terrible.

739
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,133
My... something terrible.

740
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,216
Dads...

741
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:37,174
Can be scary sometimes.

742
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:42,882
Norman, guess what?

743
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:44,424
What?

744
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:48,758
I'm a orchid.

745
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:51,800
Not me.

746
00:38:51,883 --> 00:38:53,923
Well, then what flower are you?

747
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:56,384
An apple doughnut with raisins.

748
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:59,216
That's nice.

749
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:04,341
I'm a orchid.

750
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:19,548
Norman, can I have your keys?

751
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:22,091
Boy! Sheila, I need my keys.

752
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:25,965
I can't get into things
without my keys.

753
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:28,508
Sheila, I need my keys.

754
00:39:28,591 --> 00:39:35,299
Besides, orchids don't have
pockets to put keys into.

755
00:39:35,383 --> 00:39:37,175
Everybody knows that.

756
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:40,465
I forgot.

757
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:50,775
I don't know what you guys
want me to tell you.

758
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:52,525
Do you want me to tell you
why I hate my job?

759
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,389
Do you want me to tell you...
You want me to...

760
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:57,024
Do you want me to tell you that every
time I lose my temper with these guys,

761
00:40:57,048 --> 00:40:58,507
I hate myself for about a week?

762
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,590
Fine. I admit it.
I need a new job.

763
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:02,383
But that doesn't help.

764
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:04,965
They do deserve better.
I deserve better.

765
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,549
Somebody deserves better.

766
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,008
How about your wife?

767
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:09,548
Maybe she deserves better.

768
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:10,631
No maybe about it.

769
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:12,274
But you don't share
much of this with her.

770
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:15,715
That's not true.
I share a lot with her...

771
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:17,382
Don't I?

772
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:19,674
You tell me what's going on.

773
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:22,258
You don't tell me
how it's affecting you,

774
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:24,217
but I know how guilty you feel.

775
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,674
What do I feel guilty about?

776
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:29,507
I think you feel guilty about what's
gonna happen to them if you leave.

777
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,507
I think you feel guilty about needing
to take care of yourself for a change.

778
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,966
I think a lot of things.

779
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:39,758
All I know is that these...

780
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:45,549
These dear, sweet, damaged guys

781
00:41:45,632 --> 00:41:49,298
are eating you up alive.

782
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:54,341
Is that right, Jack?

783
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:57,673
I don't know.

784
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:03,674
This is hard to talk about.

785
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:06,465
That's one thing
I hear cops say.

786
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:10,048
Very high divorce rate
among cops.

787
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:17,466
They need me.

788
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:19,715
What happens when they
don't need you anymore?

789
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:21,966
They'll never
not need me anymore.

790
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:25,090
Who made that rule? You?

791
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:27,175
No, not me.

792
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:30,091
God.

793
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:36,715
I'm sorry.

794
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,050
We are not gonna

795
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:43,465
have scrammbled eggs
anymore, not ever!

796
00:42:44,756 --> 00:42:48,007
Scrammbled eggs stick like
anything and it's not fair.

797
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:49,631
Well, try this job.

798
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:52,548
This is a really tough job.

799
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:55,799
This, this isn't even
supposed to by my job.

800
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:57,965
This is supposed to be Barry's
job, but...

801
00:42:58,048 --> 00:43:00,966
But he says he can't do his job
because his father is coming.

802
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,382
Lucien p. Singer be home.

803
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:04,340
Hey Lucien

804
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:05,173
huh.

805
00:43:05,257 --> 00:43:07,048
Lucien I need your help.

806
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:08,133
Okay.

807
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,298
Lucien! - Huh?

808
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:16,175
Lucien, you need to
vacuum the living room.

809
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:17,317
We need to be spic and span.

810
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:20,092
Because we got
Barry's father coming.

811
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:21,091
I know that.

812
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:22,214
Why is it always Barry?

813
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:25,675
Sheila... Sheila's gotta come
see my pad, don't forget?

814
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:26,549
She is?!

815
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:28,091
If Jack says yes.

816
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:30,465
And then when Sheila
and me get married,

817
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:32,799
we're gonna have a baby boy
and then a baby girl,

818
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:37,091
and... and they can all go to work
with me and get free doughnuts

819
00:43:37,174 --> 00:43:40,382
and day-old crullers if
they've been really, really good.

820
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:45,506
Lucien... Lucien, you
gotta plug in the plug.

821
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,842
When you plug it, it be loud.

822
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,840
We need to get the dust.

823
00:43:49,923 --> 00:43:51,216
Norman? - What?

824
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:53,840
Where do dust come from?

825
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,257
From... trees.

826
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,383
We got no trees. - Yeah.

827
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:00,257
Can I start now?

828
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,340
No.

829
00:44:02,258 --> 00:44:03,258
Come in... ow!

830
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,757
My name is Norman Bulansky.
Welcome to my home.

831
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:07,550
Hi, guys.

832
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:08,258
Hey, Jack.

833
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,790
Jack! Hi, Jack! How are you?

834
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:13,049
The job's going great.
Nice to see you again.

835
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:13,757
Ow!

836
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:15,258
Arnold's out beating the rugs.

837
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:18,757
But Barry, he says he
won't help. He's too busy.

838
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:20,882
He says 'cause his dad's
coming to visit,

839
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:21,966
he needs to get ready.

840
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:23,800
So he says he don't
have to do the dishes.

841
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:25,025
Ok, I'll talk to him, Norman.

842
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:28,259
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.

843
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:32,841
Lucien. - Huh?

844
00:44:32,924 --> 00:44:34,382
Lucien, would you do the dishes?

845
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:38,924
No, thank you. I be dusting.

846
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,589
Aah!

847
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:57,257
Ok, Lucien? Good man.

848
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,048
Norman? Way to go.

849
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:02,133
Arnold.

850
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:05,924
3 a day. 2 is not gonna do it.

851
00:45:07,715 --> 00:45:11,633
Oh, Barry, Barry, Barry.

852
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:14,757
I heard Jack's voice.

853
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:16,452
Where is he?
I have to talk to him.

854
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:17,800
He be hitting his head.

855
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,715
Well, this is important.
It can't wait.

856
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:21,383
Jack! We have
to have a discussion!

857
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,714
Hold your horses,
Arnold. I'll be right there.

858
00:45:23,798 --> 00:45:25,841
Arnold? You got horses?

859
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:28,882
No, he's got me confused
with somebody else.

860
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:30,132
I don't have any horses.

861
00:45:30,215 --> 00:45:32,965
Jack! It's me! Arnold!

862
00:45:33,048 --> 00:45:34,174
We got no tree!

863
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:36,506
Ok, Arnold.
What's the big emergency?

864
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:39,840
I'm having a little bit
of a problem with the rugs.

865
00:45:39,923 --> 00:45:41,924
What rugs? - These rugs.

866
00:45:42,008 --> 00:45:43,258
Arnold, you got horses?

867
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:47,465
And Jack... Jack, we gotta make
it illegal to have steak sauce.

868
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:50,424
I scrub it, I scrub it.
It won't come out.

869
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:52,089
We need to have a meeting.

870
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:53,983
Norman's right.
We need to have a meeting.

871
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,965
Ok. Lucien, you go have
a meeting in your room

872
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:58,633
and work on what you're gonna
say to the senate people today.

873
00:45:58,716 --> 00:45:59,924
Here. I got you a present.

874
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,109
How come he gets a present?!

875
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,383
Arnold, you go outside

876
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:03,746
and have a meeting
with your rugs

877
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:05,108
and decide what needs
to be said about that...

878
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:06,275
You know, I could
just move to Russia

879
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:07,779
and I wouldn't even
have this problem.

880
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,007
I could just lay around all
day and listen to Tchaikovsky!

881
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:12,257
Spider-man tie!

882
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,440
Come on.
Don't stop walking, Lucien.

883
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:15,549
Let's go, let's go. Let's go.

884
00:46:15,632 --> 00:46:18,091
And I mean business!

885
00:46:20,133 --> 00:46:22,217
Ok. Go.

886
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,174
Jack, can... can Sheila
come over here sometime?

887
00:46:27,797 --> 00:46:28,713
Just me and her alone.

888
00:46:28,797 --> 00:46:33,340
I... I'd like her
to see... my pad.

889
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,423
Just the two of you?

890
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:38,383
I don't know, Norman.
That could be a little...

891
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:39,465
Tricky.

892
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,341
But Barry says
if you call it a pad,

893
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:44,464
girls will come over, because...

894
00:46:45,465 --> 00:46:46,466
I'm not sure why.

895
00:46:46,508 --> 00:46:48,133
I'll think about it, ok?

896
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:51,423
All right, then, fine!

897
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:52,706
Nobody cares about the rugs...

898
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:55,798
It's Norman's turn,
Arnold. It is not your turn.

899
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:56,882
If anyone wants me,

900
00:46:57,216 --> 00:46:58,483
I will be up in my room
thinking about these rugs,

901
00:46:58,507 --> 00:46:59,987
and if a certain person,
for instance,

902
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:01,234
would like to know
what happened to them,

903
00:47:01,258 --> 00:47:02,360
he'll have to ask me,
and frankly,

904
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:03,924
I'm not telling anybody anyway!

905
00:47:04,007 --> 00:47:06,883
So, if he does ask,
he's in for a big surprise!

906
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:09,549
Fine. That's just what
I need in my life, Arnold,

907
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:10,633
more big surprises!

908
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:12,508
Like who's not taking
their medication?

909
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:13,591
Ooohhh!

910
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:16,423
Taught myself how to tie.
A spider-man tie.

911
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:19,424
Jack! Jack!
I'll call Sheila now, ok?

912
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:21,673
No, Norman, you will
not call Sheila now. No.

913
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:22,924
Give me the phone.

914
00:47:24,215 --> 00:47:25,631
Arnold, wait your turn!

915
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:26,715
No!

916
00:47:27,715 --> 00:47:30,465
Will you guys give it a rest?!

917
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:33,007
I feel like I'm inside
a blender!

918
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:44,341
First thing my dad will
see when he comes in.

919
00:47:44,424 --> 00:47:49,590
Barry, your dad doesn't
arrive till tomorrow, right?

920
00:47:49,674 --> 00:47:50,674
Right.

921
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:53,715
Well, you kinda
walled off the bathroom.

922
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:56,007
We can use the bushes, Jack.

923
00:47:56,091 --> 00:47:57,966
No, Lucien,
you can't use the bushes.

924
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,424
Or hold it. We could hold it.

925
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:01,383
Arnold, you can't hold it
for an entire day.

926
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,673
If we clench, I bet we can.

927
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,757
I don't think so.

928
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,715
We can use
the gas station on woodlow.

929
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:22,298
Hello. My name is
Norman Bulansky.

930
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:24,090
Welcome to my... home.

931
00:48:24,173 --> 00:48:25,841
Hello. I'm...

932
00:48:31,048 --> 00:48:32,299
My name is Karen Warren.

933
00:48:32,383 --> 00:48:35,548
My husband and I, we just...
We moved in next door.

934
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:40,299
Lucien p. Singer,
and I mean business.

935
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:41,299
Hello, Mr. Singer.

936
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:43,674
Hi. - Hello again.

937
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:46,048
I am so sorry to bother you.

938
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,133
That's ok.
What can we do for you?

939
00:48:48,715 --> 00:48:50,674
It's pretty important
at our house.

940
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:53,133
My son's hamster
got out of its cage,

941
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:57,174
and Burt and I have just had no
luck in tracking the little devil down.

942
00:48:57,258 --> 00:49:00,757
We've been to every
other house on the block.

943
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:01,841
I, uh...

944
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:06,217
I... I saved this house
for last because I...

945
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,757
Of course, I didn't want
to bother you.

946
00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:11,589
Your son's hamster is missing?

947
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,340
Aren't hamsters members
of the rodent family?

948
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:19,298
Mm-hmm. It has
kind of cute little ears

949
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:21,383
and a wiggly kind of nose.

950
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:24,632
How... how big is he?

951
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:28,549
1-1/2 doughnuts
to 2 doughnuts long?

952
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,340
Or about the size
of a French cruller?

953
00:49:31,423 --> 00:49:33,382
Yes. It would be... yes. Right.

954
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:35,298
About... about like that, yes.

955
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:39,841
You know, if you could give
us some help in flushing him out,

956
00:49:39,924 --> 00:49:41,507
I would be so grateful.

957
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,008
Flushing.
Oh, we've been flushing.

958
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:46,841
Oh, boy.

959
00:49:46,924 --> 00:49:48,049
They just love animals.

960
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:50,715
They're very sensitive when
it comes to one getting lost.

961
00:49:56,924 --> 00:49:57,966
Knock it off, Barry.

962
00:49:58,049 --> 00:50:01,633
This is bad.
This is very, very bad.

963
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:02,716
Oh, boy.

964
00:50:02,924 --> 00:50:05,174
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to upset them.

965
00:50:05,258 --> 00:50:09,465
Down he goes,
just like toilet paper.

966
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,841
Oh, no, it's ok.
Look, Mrs. Warren,

967
00:50:11,924 --> 00:50:13,275
we'll do everything
we can, really.

968
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:15,179
If anything comes up,
we'll call you right away.

969
00:50:15,214 --> 00:50:16,214
Oh, boy!

970
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:18,299
Oh, boy! Oh, yeah!
We'll call! Bye-bye!

971
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:21,006
Thank you for visiting me.
Come again.

972
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,215
Thanks. Bye. - Bye!

973
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:30,798
Jack, Jack we murdered
a hampster.

974
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:31,798
Its okay.

975
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:32,882
Guys, come on,

976
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:34,590
life works like this sometimes.

977
00:50:34,674 --> 00:50:37,673
Aw Lucien. Norman its all right.

978
00:50:37,757 --> 00:50:39,506
Lucien, aw.

979
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:42,756
Come on, hey. The thing is you
just gotta pick up and carry on.

980
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,424
Right? It's okay,
it's all right.

981
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:46,507
Hey, what do we gotta do?

982
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:47,714
What do you do?

983
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,383
What do we gotta do?
Come on tell me?

984
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:50,341
You gotta rock-n-roll.

985
00:50:50,424 --> 00:50:51,133
Rock-n-roll.

986
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:52,133
Gotta boggie.

987
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,383
Gotta boggie.

988
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:55,174
Come on, that's it.

989
00:50:55,258 --> 00:50:57,549
You know what else you
got to do Jack?

990
00:50:57,632 --> 00:50:59,300
What, what do we gotta do?

991
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:02,756
Today is the day you
got to tie my tie.

992
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,756
Well all right then,

993
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,423
come on lets go.

994
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:07,340
All right guys, go on get
up those stairs.

995
00:51:07,423 --> 00:51:09,674
Go on! Get up those stairs.

996
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:14,423
Lucien, did you take a shower?

997
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:21,882
I just washed my hands
and my knees and my feet.

998
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:24,548
You're supposed to
do your whole body, pal,

999
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:26,506
not just selected parts.

1000
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:27,840
It's not like a movie preview.

1001
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:30,757
It's awfully wet in there, Jack.

1002
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,632
I screwed this up.
I got to do it again.

1003
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:37,133
What a retard.

1004
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:49,465
You know I don't think
Barry has ever been asked

1005
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:51,966
to testify before
the State Senate.

1006
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:53,507
I don't think Arnold
ever has either.

1007
00:51:54,674 --> 00:51:56,424
And I'm pretty sure that
Norman never has.

1008
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:58,383
They picked you Lucien.

1009
00:51:58,465 --> 00:52:00,423
What's the because Jack?

1010
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:02,214
They wanted someone good.

1011
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:04,216
And that's you.

1012
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:06,589
I got a library card.

1013
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:09,840
Ah huh. And friends.
You got friends.

1014
00:52:09,923 --> 00:52:11,923
You got Barry, and Arnold,
and Norman.

1015
00:52:12,006 --> 00:52:13,817
And you're gonna be helping
all of them by talking

1016
00:52:13,841 --> 00:52:14,841
to these people today.

1017
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,173
I got to be a helper.

1018
00:52:17,382 --> 00:52:18,383
Big time.

1019
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:23,173
Health and human services
sub-committee.

1020
00:52:23,257 --> 00:52:25,424
Senator Warren Clarke presiding.

1021
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:28,049
Order, please.
We are in session.

1022
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:30,465
Good morning, Mr. Singer.

1023
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:35,007
We're very happy you were
able to join us here this morning.

1024
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:36,131
As our staff informed you,

1025
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:38,881
this sub-committee is only
interested in the truth,

1026
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:42,881
so there are no right
or wrong answers.

1027
00:52:42,965 --> 00:52:47,507
Do you understand that,
Mr. Singer?

1028
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:51,342
Spider-man tie.

1029
00:52:51,425 --> 00:52:54,048
I'm afraid we weren't
able to hear that, Mr. Singer.

1030
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:56,298
You'll have to speak up
a little.

1031
00:52:58,047 --> 00:53:03,714
My name is Lucien p. Singer,
and I mean business.

1032
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:05,173
I got a spider-man tie.

1033
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:08,383
They know. Take your seat.

1034
00:53:08,465 --> 00:53:10,215
Sit down. It's all right.

1035
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:12,882
Mr. Singer, I'll tell you what.

1036
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:17,798
Why don't you tell us a little bit
about where you live, your home.

1037
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:21,173
Could you do that
for us, Mr. Singer?

1038
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:27,133
It... hard.

1039
00:53:27,216 --> 00:53:31,257
You know, it... hard.

1040
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:33,632
All right, Mr. Singer.

1041
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:38,258
Then why don't you
tell us about your friends?

1042
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:42,799
Ok, Jack. We done now?

1043
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:46,257
No. Just tell 'em
about the house,

1044
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,217
about Norman and Barry.

1045
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,464
You mean business.

1046
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:57,506
Norman, he be the doughnut man.

1047
00:53:57,589 --> 00:53:58,924
The doughnut man?

1048
00:53:59,007 --> 00:54:00,258
Uh-huh.

1049
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:01,798
Why do you call him that?

1050
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,257
He be fat... with doughnuts.

1051
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,589
Arnold, he got the rugs.

1052
00:54:09,673 --> 00:54:14,006
If he don't go to Russia,
he, like, nuts or something.

1053
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,341
He my friend. So's Barry.

1054
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:20,465
He calls. His daddy
come and see him,

1055
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,550
and that's scary.

1056
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,299
Norman wants Sheila
to see his pad.

1057
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,423
I stand before you a grown man

1058
00:54:47,506 --> 00:54:49,797
in uncomfortable clothes.

1059
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:53,340
A man whose capacity
for rational thought

1060
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,799
is somewhere between that
of a 5-year-old

1061
00:54:56,882 --> 00:54:59,132
and an oyster.

1062
00:55:04,258 --> 00:55:06,173
I'm retarded.

1063
00:55:06,506 --> 00:55:07,507
I'm damaged.

1064
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:10,756
I'm sick inside from so many
years of confusion,

1065
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,090
utter and profound confusion.

1066
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:18,549
I'm mystified by faucets
and radios,

1067
00:55:18,632 --> 00:55:22,673
elevators and newspapers
and popular songs.

1068
00:55:23,174 --> 00:55:26,465
I cannot always remember
the names of my parents.

1069
00:55:26,841 --> 00:55:30,091
But I will not go away,

1070
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:34,549
and damaged though I may be,
I shall not wither

1071
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:37,548
because I am unique
and irreplaceable

1072
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:40,715
and a part of you all.

1073
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:46,923
Civilizations are judged

1074
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:52,133
by the way they treat their
most helpless of citizens.

1075
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:55,174
I am that citizen.

1076
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:58,173
And if you turn away from me,

1077
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:00,841
you extinguish your own light,

1078
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,173
deny your own warmth.

1079
00:56:05,923 --> 00:56:08,299
I am just...

1080
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:10,924
A simple man.

1081
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,298
But I simply am...

1082
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:20,215
A man.

1083
00:56:36,049 --> 00:56:37,841
Senator just one
other question, Mr. Singer.

1084
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:44,423
Do you feel you could work outside
of the sheltered sort of atmosphere

1085
00:56:44,506 --> 00:56:45,546
at the handicapped center?

1086
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:49,548
What do you think, Lucien?

1087
00:56:50,048 --> 00:56:53,673
You think you could work
outside the training center?

1088
00:56:54,506 --> 00:56:58,632
Lucien p. Singer say...

1089
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,133
It be hard.

1090
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:26,382
How did Mrs. Tracy take it?

1091
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:27,507
She wasn't thrilled.

1092
00:57:29,006 --> 00:57:30,942
She understood that the
car leasing job is a good one,

1093
00:57:30,966 --> 00:57:33,173
but... not thrilled.

1094
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,140
You're going to tell
the boys today, right?

1095
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:36,216
No.

1096
00:57:36,465 --> 00:57:37,649
It's a bad day.
There's too much going on.

1097
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:38,382
Jack.

1098
00:57:38,673 --> 00:57:39,382
Norman's got Sheila coming over,

1099
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:41,132
Barry's dad pulls in tonight.

1100
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:44,548
Your job is to help these
guys function in the real world.

1101
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:46,109
You don't need to tell me
my job, Rena.

1102
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:48,216
If I told every kid
I placed in a foster home

1103
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:50,089
they could stay there
as long as they wanted,

1104
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:52,049
I wouldn't be doing them
a favor.

1105
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:53,423
It's not real.

1106
00:57:53,506 --> 00:57:55,506
In the real world,
people get hurt.

1107
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:57,006
People get disappointed.

1108
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:01,090
These guys spend 24 hours
a day in a world of hurt.

1109
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:04,631
I don't want to be the one
to make it worse.

1110
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,175
I know how much
they mean to you.

1111
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:11,424
But tell them. It's time.

1112
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,589
I know.

1113
00:58:14,006 --> 00:58:16,506
I hate it, but I know.

1114
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:55,882
Hi, Sheila!

1115
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:56,967
Hi, Norman.

1116
00:58:57,007 --> 00:58:57,881
Hi, Sheila!

1117
00:58:57,965 --> 00:58:58,965
Hi, Norman.

1118
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:00,007
Hi, Sheila.

1119
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:03,840
Hello. My name is
Norman Bulansky.

1120
00:59:03,923 --> 00:59:06,966
Welcome to my home.
Won't you take a seat?

1121
00:59:10,674 --> 00:59:13,590
Morning Barry,
where's your student?

1122
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:15,007
Uh, stuck in traffic, probably.

1123
00:59:15,091 --> 00:59:17,174
She'll be along, ya.

1124
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:27,006
You suggest I should
feel something for you?

1125
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:30,048
You'll be pleased to know
I do feel something for you.

1126
00:59:30,132 --> 00:59:32,024
There's something I forgot
to tell you yesterday.

1127
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:36,256
Stephanie doesn't know
that kirk is her father.

1128
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:40,506
But if kirk reveals that
he's Stephanie's father,

1129
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:45,464
more than likely that would
cause Andrea to kill herself.

1130
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,091
Wow.

1131
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:50,798
Talk about
your behavior patterns.

1132
00:59:50,881 --> 00:59:52,172
This is nice.

1133
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,049
Yeah. It used to be better

1134
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,090
when we had those little rugs,

1135
00:59:56,173 --> 00:59:58,341
but Arnold's got them hid.

1136
00:59:58,424 --> 00:59:59,507
Arnold? Yecch!

1137
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,048
He's not here, is he?

1138
01:00:01,132 --> 01:00:03,092
Oh, boy, that's all we need.

1139
01:00:03,175 --> 01:00:04,549
Can I manage your coat?

1140
01:00:04,632 --> 01:00:06,382
I don't have one.

1141
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:08,173
Oh, boy.

1142
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,549
I got these for you.

1143
01:00:14,632 --> 01:00:16,215
Flowers?

1144
01:00:16,298 --> 01:00:17,799
Oh.

1145
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:20,632
I picked them at that lot
near the swanco gas station.

1146
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:21,589
You know that lot?

1147
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:25,298
Swanco gas, that's good gas.

1148
01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:31,215
Would you please
like a doughnut?

1149
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,383
00.

1150
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,048
The bus comes then.

1151
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,423
Oh, boy.

1152
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:44,173
All right. I know what to do.

1153
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,048
A pad.

1154
01:00:53,756 --> 01:00:57,631
This... this is the clock
that Barry uses

1155
01:00:57,714 --> 01:01:00,215
when... when he makes eggs.

1156
01:01:00,298 --> 01:01:02,507
And I don't like eggs.

1157
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:03,590
They make sticky plates.

1158
01:01:03,631 --> 01:01:05,589
Don't get me started
on lemonade.

1159
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:09,383
But we'll just set this at 4...

1160
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,841
And the bell will tell us
when it's time.

1161
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:14,132
It... it works like
a Butler or somebody.

1162
01:01:14,215 --> 01:01:17,090
It's very good, Norman.

1163
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:24,506
Ooh! We got a shower curtain
with sailboats.

1164
01:01:24,589 --> 01:01:26,215
You want to see?

1165
01:01:28,132 --> 01:01:31,216
I went before I came.

1166
01:01:34,715 --> 01:01:37,381
I could see the sailboats
anyway.

1167
01:01:37,463 --> 01:01:39,881
Why not? You're here.

1168
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:51,216
Oh. Oh, boy.

1169
01:01:51,506 --> 01:01:54,174
I'm very sorry, but I... I think

1170
01:01:54,258 --> 01:01:55,465
I broke your flowers.

1171
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:57,133
That's all right, Norman.

1172
01:01:57,216 --> 01:01:58,216
I'm very sorry.

1173
01:01:58,258 --> 01:02:00,173
That's all right.

1174
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:05,590
No, you mustn't think of
Stephanie as a bad person.

1175
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:07,174
She's not, not down deep.

1176
01:02:07,258 --> 01:02:10,882
But I think when pennington
stole her baby,

1177
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:12,589
she lost her sense of propriety.

1178
01:02:12,673 --> 01:02:14,006
There's so many names.

1179
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,173
How do you keep them
all straight?

1180
01:02:16,257 --> 01:02:18,257
Ha ha. It's in my journal.

1181
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,966
Daytime drama journal.

1182
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:22,132
Comes out once a week.

1183
01:02:22,215 --> 01:02:23,215
$30 a year.

1184
01:02:23,755 --> 01:02:25,190
If I miss an episode,
I can look it up.

1185
01:02:25,214 --> 01:02:27,756
It's like keeping up with family
when you're out of town.

1186
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,024
Keeping up with family
sounds nice.

1187
01:02:29,048 --> 01:02:30,108
Could I get the journal too?

1188
01:02:30,132 --> 01:02:33,756
Ha ha ha. Have you got $30?

1189
01:02:35,048 --> 01:02:35,714
30?

1190
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:37,465
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,007
20, 25, 30...

1192
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,174
I got 33.70.

1193
01:02:43,674 --> 01:02:48,382
If we both subscribe to
the daytime drama journal,

1194
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,840
it'll be as if we're
in the same club.

1195
01:02:50,923 --> 01:02:54,507
And I will join
in the same club with you

1196
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:55,590
on one condition.

1197
01:02:55,798 --> 01:02:58,383
Mr. Wiggins, I assume
you're about to return

1198
01:02:58,465 --> 01:03:00,966
that conveyance
to its rightful owner.

1199
01:03:01,049 --> 01:03:03,050
Mmm hmm hmm hmm.

1200
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:13,840
We usually don't
have a sign up like this.

1201
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,006
It's just for special times.

1202
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,173
It's a cozy pad, Norman.

1203
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:19,424
Yeah. We like it.

1204
01:03:19,506 --> 01:03:21,090
Would you please
have another doughnut?

1205
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,799
I had spaghetti-os for lunch.

1206
01:03:24,882 --> 01:03:25,882
Then it's time.

1207
01:03:25,966 --> 01:03:28,464
Go have a doughnut on the couch.

1208
01:03:28,548 --> 01:03:32,798
I have a surprise
to surprise you with. Oh!

1209
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:34,299
Let me guess.

1210
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:35,383
Is it a frog?

1211
01:03:35,506 --> 01:03:38,173
Oh, boy. A frog would
be hard to grab.

1212
01:03:38,673 --> 01:03:41,174
You know, you're so funny.

1213
01:03:41,258 --> 01:03:42,882
I sure am funny. Oh, boy.

1214
01:03:42,965 --> 01:03:43,965
You ain't kiddin'.

1215
01:03:44,048 --> 01:03:47,714
Sheila, I got you this.
It's a present.

1216
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:49,174
Oh, Norman.

1217
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,259
I feel all jumpy.

1218
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,341
Me, too. Can I have the bows?

1219
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:54,173
No.

1220
01:04:05,257 --> 01:04:09,090
Oh, Norman... keys.

1221
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:10,340
You got me keys.

1222
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:12,464
They're nice, huh? Try them on.

1223
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:15,090
Oh, boy, I can't wait
to see them on.

1224
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:17,298
Oh. What side?

1225
01:04:17,382 --> 01:04:20,214
Whatever makes you
feel more balanced.

1226
01:04:20,297 --> 01:04:22,383
Arnold got me all the keys.

1227
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:24,631
They're movie theater keys.

1228
01:04:24,714 --> 01:04:26,755
Movie keys?

1229
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:30,049
Oh, boy, did that go fast.

1230
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:30,798
I got to go.

1231
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:32,090
Oh, Norman.

1232
01:04:32,258 --> 01:04:33,498
We are too close together.

1233
01:04:33,924 --> 01:04:35,524
I got to go. The bus
leaves, Norman, 00. It don't wait.

1234
01:04:35,548 --> 01:04:36,816
Thank you. Thank you
for visiting with my home.

1235
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,965
Won't you take a doughnut
for the road?

1236
01:04:39,048 --> 01:04:40,464
I got to go.

1237
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:41,589
Uh...

1238
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:43,006
Norman.

1239
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:47,382
This is the most, best,
beautiful present

1240
01:04:47,464 --> 01:04:49,341
I ever got.

1241
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:56,091
Me, too.

1242
01:05:54,382 --> 01:05:55,463
Well, look who's here.

1243
01:05:55,547 --> 01:05:59,589
I'll be with you
in a minute, sir.

1244
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:01,257
How are you doing today?

1245
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,382
Pretty nice out there, isn't it?

1246
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:06,423
Yeah, but I, uh...

1247
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,840
Wait!

1248
01:06:18,923 --> 01:06:19,423
Wait!

1249
01:06:19,673 --> 01:06:20,714
I don't have any money!

1250
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:22,149
I gave all my money
to Mrs. Fremus!

1251
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:23,966
Do you have a credit card?

1252
01:06:24,049 --> 01:06:26,298
We do accept credit cards.

1253
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,298
No.

1254
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:29,882
Sir, if you don't have any money

1255
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:32,006
or credit cards, I'm afraid
all of these items

1256
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:35,382
are going to have to go back
on the shelf.

1257
01:06:40,174 --> 01:06:41,924
Ha ha ha!

1258
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:43,007
Yes!

1259
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:47,299
Arnold wiggins, one,
the system, zero!

1260
01:06:47,383 --> 01:06:48,383
Ha ha ha!

1261
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:53,506
Ha ha ha!

1262
01:07:22,548 --> 01:07:25,423
Barry, it be Lucien here.

1263
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:27,549
Is he here?

1264
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:30,132
Not your dad, but Jack's here.

1265
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:32,216
Says he needs to talk to us.

1266
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:34,215
Said he's got an announcement.

1267
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:36,216
That's not good.

1268
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:37,633
How come?

1269
01:07:37,966 --> 01:07:39,816
You tell good news,
you announce the bad stuff.

1270
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,257
Oh.

1271
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:43,423
Oh.

1272
01:07:44,924 --> 01:07:47,547
And time just went by
quick as spit, Jack.

1273
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:52,298
I... I think that must be
what happens when...

1274
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:53,383
When what?

1275
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:55,589
When people have enough
keys and doughnuts.

1276
01:07:55,673 --> 01:07:56,899
What's the announcement, Jack?

1277
01:07:56,923 --> 01:08:00,341
Arnold, here come
the announcement!

1278
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:02,964
Listen, my water's
gonna get cold

1279
01:08:03,047 --> 01:08:04,548
if this takes a long time.

1280
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:05,257
It's ok, Arnold.

1281
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:07,297
I'm gonna keep this real short.

1282
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:10,048
Ok, what is it?

1283
01:08:10,673 --> 01:08:12,298
Unh.

1284
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,299
Wow.

1285
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:23,673
You done, Jack?

1286
01:08:23,756 --> 01:08:25,549
No. No, I'm not.

1287
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:29,965
I have this friend who has
this business leasing cars

1288
01:08:30,048 --> 01:08:31,756
and, um...

1289
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:35,048
He's offered me a position,
a job.

1290
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:37,965
And there's a pretty good
piece of change involved.

1291
01:08:38,589 --> 01:08:39,732
Can you get us a car, Jack?

1292
01:08:39,756 --> 01:08:41,674
Hey, Jack, a red Capri
would be nice.

1293
01:08:41,757 --> 01:08:43,173
Vroom-vroom.

1294
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:45,298
It doesn't have to
be red, but red would...

1295
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:46,840
I repeat, would be nice.

1296
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:47,981
I mean, I'll still be around.

1297
01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:50,172
It's not far.
It's in the neighborhood.

1298
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:52,923
He's here!

1299
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,755
Now remember the deal.

1300
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,589
Dads can be scary sometimes.

1301
01:08:57,673 --> 01:08:59,923
We got no trees!

1302
01:09:00,006 --> 01:09:01,215
Barry! Barry!

1303
01:09:01,298 --> 01:09:03,149
Under no circumstances
let your dad in the kitchen

1304
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:04,482
to see that
I haven't done the dishes,

1305
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:06,108
or he'll think I was born
in a barn or something.

1306
01:09:06,132 --> 01:09:07,465
So nyet on
seeing the dishes, ok?

1307
01:09:07,549 --> 01:09:08,549
Please, go upstairs!

1308
01:09:08,924 --> 01:09:12,506
Ok. Barry, listen, if I
can return groceries,

1309
01:09:12,589 --> 01:09:15,798
you can do this.

1310
01:09:17,673 --> 01:09:20,506
Barry, do you
want me here, or...

1311
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:21,590
Um...

1312
01:09:21,631 --> 01:09:23,465
Well, maybe not in here, maybe.

1313
01:09:23,549 --> 01:09:24,174
Just around.

1314
01:09:24,465 --> 01:09:25,565
I'll just be in the kitchen.

1315
01:09:25,589 --> 01:09:28,091
Ok.

1316
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:39,965
Hey.

1317
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:46,215
It's getting cold out.

1318
01:09:51,006 --> 01:09:54,465
Oh, it's pretty jazzy, huh?

1319
01:09:54,549 --> 01:09:55,715
Hi.

1320
01:09:56,132 --> 01:09:57,898
Oh, hi. Bob Klemper. Don't
believe I've had the pleasure.

1321
01:09:57,922 --> 01:10:00,548
Jack Palmer. I work with
the social services department.

1322
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:02,673
Oh, you're like a keeper.

1323
01:10:02,756 --> 01:10:03,673
I'm like a friend.

1324
01:10:03,756 --> 01:10:04,756
Oh.

1325
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:07,464
Barry, I'm just gonna
get some air.

1326
01:10:07,548 --> 01:10:09,024
I'm gonna go sit on
the porch for a minute.

1327
01:10:09,048 --> 01:10:10,216
Is that ok with you?

1328
01:10:10,299 --> 01:10:11,299
Ok. Ok.

1329
01:10:11,549 --> 01:10:11,841
I'll be right out here
if you need anything.

1330
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:13,589
Ok - nice meeting you.

1331
01:10:13,673 --> 01:10:16,590
Yeah, have a good one.

1332
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:22,464
Well, here we are.

1333
01:10:33,588 --> 01:10:35,024
Um, you want a cola?
We got some...

1334
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:37,881
Nothing hard, or anything
like that, I don't suppose?

1335
01:10:37,965 --> 01:10:38,548
No, we don't.

1336
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:41,172
Cola's fine.

1337
01:10:43,464 --> 01:10:45,422
Oh, there's a sign.

1338
01:10:45,505 --> 01:10:47,840
There's a what?

1339
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,798
Uh, it's over the bathroom door.

1340
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,798
Did you do that?

1341
01:10:53,881 --> 01:10:56,840
Uh...

1342
01:10:58,507 --> 01:11:00,133
It's a little
inconvenient, isn't it?

1343
01:11:00,216 --> 01:11:03,882
I mean, you gotta duck down
just to get in the can.

1344
01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:09,423
It's a nice, sign, Barry.
I appreciate it.

1345
01:11:11,215 --> 01:11:12,340
What?

1346
01:11:12,423 --> 01:11:13,923
Did Sheila like the keys?

1347
01:11:14,006 --> 01:11:18,382
Oh, she loved 'em
like French fries.

1348
01:11:18,464 --> 01:11:20,341
Great.

1349
01:11:20,424 --> 01:11:23,924
When do I get 'em back?

1350
01:11:24,007 --> 01:11:25,966
Get 'em back?

1351
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,756
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1352
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,089
Shh! Be quiet.

1353
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,048
Ha ha ha!

1354
01:11:43,923 --> 01:11:44,506
What was funny?

1355
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:47,882
Well... talk about a sign,

1356
01:11:47,966 --> 01:11:49,090
I'll tell you about a sign.

1357
01:11:49,547 --> 01:11:53,005
Did I ever tell you about the
first word that you ever said?

1358
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:53,880
Yeah.

1359
01:11:53,964 --> 01:11:54,964
Fortitude.

1360
01:11:55,298 --> 01:11:56,483
You were 3 years old,
and you hadn't said a word,

1361
01:11:56,507 --> 01:11:58,464
and your mother and I
were just worried sick

1362
01:11:58,548 --> 01:11:59,589
you were never gonna talk,

1363
01:11:59,673 --> 01:12:01,005
and then right out of the blue,

1364
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,840
fortitude!

1365
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:06,424
Lord knows where that came from.

1366
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:19,006
So, tell me, what do you do?

1367
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,091
What do...

1368
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:23,258
What do you do, Barry?
People do things.

1369
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:24,898
I mean, you're not
just sitting around here

1370
01:12:24,922 --> 01:12:27,463
watching game shows and soap
operas all day long, are you?

1371
01:12:27,548 --> 01:12:30,006
'Cause I'll tell you
something, if you are, pal,

1372
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:31,006
that may be part of the problem.

1373
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,090
You gotta get out.

1374
01:12:32,173 --> 01:12:33,923
You gotta
get out and meet people.

1375
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:35,381
I give golf lessons.

1376
01:12:35,463 --> 01:12:36,464
You give what?

1377
01:12:36,589 --> 01:12:40,506
Uh, I teach people
how to play golf.

1378
01:12:40,588 --> 01:12:42,047
Miniature golf?

1379
01:12:42,131 --> 01:12:46,506
No, at the pro shop golf range.

1380
01:12:46,756 --> 01:12:49,464
You give golf lessons?

1381
01:12:50,423 --> 01:12:51,548
Do you have students?

1382
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:55,424
Uh, I actually lost one today.

1383
01:12:56,798 --> 01:12:58,880
Um, I... but, uh,

1384
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:00,383
well, it's what I do, really.

1385
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:01,673
Well, hey, that happens.

1386
01:13:01,756 --> 01:13:03,257
But this is a job, right?

1387
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,589
I mean, this is a "job" job.

1388
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,274
This is not a hobby or some
pencil-necked thing like that, right?

1389
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:08,464
This is what you do.

1390
01:13:08,548 --> 01:13:11,383
Right.

1391
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:13,589
So...

1392
01:13:13,673 --> 01:13:15,882
Well, you know...

1393
01:13:15,966 --> 01:13:18,216
Keeper!

1394
01:13:21,547 --> 01:13:25,756
Keeper, you got a car? Huh?

1395
01:13:26,965 --> 01:13:29,505
Ok, pal.

1396
01:13:34,257 --> 01:13:35,257
Oh, nice swing.

1397
01:13:35,548 --> 01:13:38,881
Let's get a good one, now.
Let's get a good one.

1398
01:13:38,965 --> 01:13:41,215
Ok? Ok, pal?

1399
01:13:41,298 --> 01:13:46,297
All right, I'm out of your way.

1400
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:49,756
Ok.

1401
01:13:52,423 --> 01:13:55,173
Ok.

1402
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:57,632
Baseball grip?

1403
01:13:57,799 --> 01:13:59,150
I haven't seen anybody
use a baseball grip

1404
01:13:59,174 --> 01:14:00,216
in I don't know how long.

1405
01:14:00,298 --> 01:14:01,881
There's nothing wrong with that,

1406
01:14:01,965 --> 01:14:05,341
you know, I'm just
making a note of it.

1407
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:07,464
Ok.

1408
01:14:09,798 --> 01:14:14,174
Show the old man
a little action.

1409
01:14:15,799 --> 01:14:17,839
Just nice and relaxed.

1410
01:14:17,922 --> 01:14:21,131
Easy does it.

1411
01:14:21,214 --> 01:14:23,882
Nice and loose.

1412
01:14:25,714 --> 01:14:27,298
That's ok. That's ok.

1413
01:14:27,382 --> 01:14:31,506
Nice and easy. Come on, Barry.

1414
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:35,798
Just hit it.

1415
01:14:35,881 --> 01:14:37,506
Ok, hit it.

1416
01:14:40,798 --> 01:14:42,215
Just hit it. Hit it.

1417
01:14:42,298 --> 01:14:44,214
Come on, Barry.

1418
01:14:44,297 --> 01:14:45,775
You're gonna teach people
to play golf,

1419
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:47,359
you're gonna have to
learn about slow playing.

1420
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:50,507
You know, it's a 2-stroke
penalty for slow play, you know.

1421
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:54,173
'Cause when you're a
teacher, you're a role model.

1422
01:14:54,257 --> 01:14:57,215
It's kind of like
being a parent.

1423
01:14:57,298 --> 01:14:58,923
It's not an easy job.

1424
01:14:59,006 --> 01:15:01,673
It's not easy at all.

1425
01:15:01,756 --> 01:15:06,590
Try to take a kid
and teach 'em things

1426
01:15:06,674 --> 01:15:10,841
so he can know it
and learn everything.

1427
01:15:14,672 --> 01:15:16,839
Barry...

1428
01:15:20,797 --> 01:15:24,172
Am I gonna have to be ashamed
of you for the rest of my life?

1429
01:15:24,256 --> 01:15:26,965
Am I? Am I?!

1430
01:15:27,048 --> 01:15:30,673
Then hit it.
Just, please, hit it.

1431
01:15:45,673 --> 01:15:47,964
Give me those.

1432
01:15:48,047 --> 01:15:49,548
You're at least gonna give me

1433
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,674
this much to remember.

1434
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,258
You see? You can hit it.

1435
01:15:55,341 --> 01:15:56,840
You can hit it.

1436
01:15:56,923 --> 01:16:00,257
What're you looking at?
What're you looking at?!

1437
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,714
That's my son.

1438
01:16:05,382 --> 01:16:06,048
I'll be in the van.

1439
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:09,464
You'll take a cab straight to...

1440
01:16:14,841 --> 01:16:16,506
Shh.

1441
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:29,797
They were great.

1442
01:16:30,172 --> 01:16:32,191
If hadn't been for Barry's
father screwing things up,

1443
01:16:32,215 --> 01:16:33,881
it would've been
a piece of cake.

1444
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:35,173
They were great?

1445
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,258
Yeah.

1446
01:16:36,464 --> 01:16:38,104
Then they didn't
get the message, Jack?

1447
01:16:38,464 --> 01:16:39,524
They don't understand
you're leaving.

1448
01:16:39,548 --> 01:16:40,965
They do understand I'm leaving.

1449
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:42,289
I told them I have another job.

1450
01:16:42,507 --> 01:16:43,827
They're giving me
a party tonight.

1451
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:45,880
They don't think of
themselves as your job.

1452
01:16:46,131 --> 01:16:48,589
You're their protector,
their angel, their friend.

1453
01:16:48,673 --> 01:16:50,548
You're not there
because of any job.

1454
01:16:50,631 --> 01:16:52,756
They didn't get the message
that you're leaving,

1455
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,589
and you know I'm right.

1456
01:16:57,424 --> 01:17:00,881
And I know you're right.

1457
01:17:00,965 --> 01:17:03,463
You know what it is?

1458
01:17:03,548 --> 01:17:06,215
They never change. I change.

1459
01:17:06,298 --> 01:17:09,463
My life changes,
my crises changes,

1460
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:11,214
but they stay ever the same.

1461
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:13,881
Barry is Barry.
Arnold is Arnold.

1462
01:17:13,965 --> 01:17:16,839
Lucien is Lucien.
Norman is Norman.

1463
01:17:16,922 --> 01:17:17,505
Keys are keys,

1464
01:17:17,797 --> 01:17:21,298
and doughnuts are doughnuts.

1465
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:06,589
Hi, Barry.

1466
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:13,257
How're you feeling?

1467
01:18:15,422 --> 01:18:16,714
I got you a book.

1468
01:18:16,798 --> 01:18:19,048
Some golf tips
from Jack nicklaus.

1469
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:23,339
It's good.
A lot of diagrams and stuff.

1470
01:18:23,422 --> 01:18:28,340
Here, you can
look it over later.

1471
01:18:28,423 --> 01:18:30,423
Norman said to say hi.

1472
01:18:31,588 --> 01:18:33,924
He sent me over
with a box of doughnuts,

1473
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:36,965
but the doctor said
they had too much sugar.

1474
01:18:37,674 --> 01:18:41,673
Arnold finally put the rug back.

1475
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:45,423
He screamed at all of us
that he wasn't a camel,

1476
01:18:45,506 --> 01:18:48,298
and that was pretty much
the end of it.

1477
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:53,632
Oh, Lucien wanted me
to give you this.

1478
01:18:54,465 --> 01:18:56,297
It's a quarter.

1479
01:18:56,922 --> 01:18:59,132
He said that when you get out,

1480
01:19:00,215 --> 01:19:02,963
he wants you to give him
a golf lesson.

1481
01:19:05,923 --> 01:19:08,839
You know, they're all having
a party for me tonight.

1482
01:19:08,923 --> 01:19:12,463
And, um, well, I was thinking

1483
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,715
it wouldn't be much of a
party without you there,

1484
01:19:14,799 --> 01:19:15,799
you know what I mean?

1485
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:17,298
So I called the lady here.

1486
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:19,798
She ok'd a pass for you.

1487
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:20,923
From, like, - - 00,

1488
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:26,506
so I can get you back
with plenty of time.

1489
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,174
Barry?

1490
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,423
Hey.

1491
01:19:40,506 --> 01:19:44,215
Why'd you close your eyes?

1492
01:19:45,006 --> 01:19:48,714
Because I can see what's coming.

1493
01:19:54,797 --> 01:19:56,464
Lucien, you got it
right in my ear!

1494
01:19:56,548 --> 01:19:58,589
If you don't stop
spraying that stuff,

1495
01:19:58,672 --> 01:19:59,981
we're all gonna
catch asthma and die.

1496
01:20:00,005 --> 01:20:03,464
I be making it
smell clean, Arnold.

1497
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:06,257
Lucien, that is
furniture Polish.

1498
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:09,964
We be havin' furniture, Arnold.

1499
01:20:11,505 --> 01:20:13,589
I hear somebody! I hear them!

1500
01:20:13,673 --> 01:20:15,131
What? - I hear somebody!

1501
01:20:16,047 --> 01:20:17,047
No. No. No! No!

1502
01:20:17,339 --> 01:20:19,340
Don't go near the window,
he'll see your shadow.

1503
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:21,340
You'll ruin the surprise.
Remember the plan?

1504
01:20:21,423 --> 01:20:22,423
Get in the closet and...

1505
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:23,006
Ahh! No chance!

1506
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:25,464
You got him in the eyes!

1507
01:20:25,548 --> 01:20:26,549
I'm sorry!

1508
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:29,465
Lucien, no, you hide
over here, behind the thing.

1509
01:20:29,549 --> 01:20:31,631
Arnie, you still in the closet?

1510
01:20:31,714 --> 01:20:32,339
Surprise!

1511
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,631
No! Stay in the closet, ok?

1512
01:20:34,714 --> 01:20:36,048
You have to get lower, ok?

1513
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:37,756
I'm trying.

1514
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,506
Ok. Just stay right there, ok?

1515
01:20:39,589 --> 01:20:41,631
Don't make any noise.
Be real quiet.

1516
01:20:41,714 --> 01:20:44,632
Sorry!

1517
01:20:46,423 --> 01:20:49,923
Come in! It's open!

1518
01:20:50,006 --> 01:20:51,589
Ta-da!

1519
01:20:51,673 --> 01:20:52,464
Surprise!

1520
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:54,132
Surprise! Surprise!

1521
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:56,630
You make a plan,
you hide in the closet,

1522
01:20:56,713 --> 01:21:00,006
you work it all out...
I don't believe this.

1523
01:21:01,714 --> 01:21:02,714
Lucien.

1524
01:21:02,755 --> 01:21:03,672
Hi Sheila.

1525
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:04,422
Hi Norman.

1526
01:21:04,505 --> 01:21:05,340
Hi Sheila.

1527
01:21:05,423 --> 01:21:08,173
Oh boy, flowers. They're pretty.

1528
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:10,173
You're welcome very much.

1529
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,006
When I got this stuff,

1530
01:21:30,422 --> 01:21:33,507
I didn't tell the lady it was
for a party of grown-up adults

1531
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:34,673
with their own home.

1532
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:35,876
I was afraid if I said that,

1533
01:21:36,132 --> 01:21:38,340
it would sound too much
like I was a bragger.

1534
01:21:38,423 --> 01:21:40,382
What's in the box, Arnold?

1535
01:21:40,464 --> 01:21:41,464
Can I guess?

1536
01:21:41,547 --> 01:21:42,381
A frog.

1537
01:21:42,463 --> 01:21:44,047
I'll bet doughnuts.

1538
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:45,463
They're both good guesses,

1539
01:21:45,547 --> 01:21:46,796
but they are both, I repeat,

1540
01:21:46,879 --> 01:21:48,506
both wrong!

1541
01:21:48,589 --> 01:21:50,173
Animal puppets!

1542
01:21:50,256 --> 01:21:52,631
Wow! Oh, boy! Animal puppets!

1543
01:21:52,714 --> 01:21:54,505
How come the puppets,
Arnold? How come?

1544
01:21:54,588 --> 01:21:55,982
How come?
Because with animal puppets,

1545
01:21:56,006 --> 01:21:59,631
you are now 3 guests at a
party instead of just one.

1546
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,048
You see, put one on one
hand, one on this hand,

1547
01:22:06,381 --> 01:22:08,131
hi, Sheila. Hi, Sheila.

1548
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:09,257
Jack's here.

1549
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:13,506
I see him! And he's got Barry!

1550
01:22:13,589 --> 01:22:14,965
Ok, let's go, everybody!

1551
01:22:15,048 --> 01:22:17,048
Familiarize yourself
with your puppets,

1552
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,148
and be ready to sing the song

1553
01:22:18,172 --> 01:22:19,631
when we
serve the doughnuts, ok?!

1554
01:22:19,714 --> 01:22:21,258
Don't forget
the words of the song!

1555
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:23,965
And remember, be really quiet!

1556
01:22:24,048 --> 01:22:26,463
Hello, my name
is Norman Bulansky!

1557
01:22:26,547 --> 01:22:27,547
No, not yet!

1558
01:22:27,588 --> 01:22:29,298
He hasn't come in yet.

1559
01:22:31,298 --> 01:22:35,840
Come in! It's open!

1560
01:22:38,547 --> 01:22:40,756
Hello?

1561
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:47,798
Is anybody home?

1562
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:50,755
Where is everybody?

1563
01:22:50,839 --> 01:22:52,756
Surprise! Surprise!

1564
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,840
Come on! He's here!

1565
01:22:53,922 --> 01:22:55,256
Oh! Surprise! Surprise!

1566
01:23:13,839 --> 01:23:14,839
Surprise!

1567
01:23:15,047 --> 01:23:17,965
Oh, boy, Jack, we got
doughnuts on the table

1568
01:23:18,048 --> 01:23:18,881
and everything.

1569
01:23:18,965 --> 01:23:19,798
And animal puppets.

1570
01:23:19,881 --> 01:23:20,965
My puppets be fighting.

1571
01:23:21,048 --> 01:23:23,048
Powee, bipee...

1572
01:23:24,257 --> 01:23:25,424
My puppets are quiet.

1573
01:23:25,507 --> 01:23:27,757
Girl puppets
are politer puppets.

1574
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:29,001
Yeah, well, all I know is...

1575
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:30,816
All you know is
you're throwing me a party.

1576
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,173
Yeah.

1577
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,256
That's great.

1578
01:23:34,339 --> 01:23:36,505
But the next question is...

1579
01:23:36,588 --> 01:23:38,880
Do you guys know why
you're throwing me this party?

1580
01:23:38,964 --> 01:23:41,880
Because of your new car job.

1581
01:23:42,089 --> 01:23:43,923
Ok.

1582
01:23:45,673 --> 01:23:47,922
But do you understand what
this car job of mine means

1583
01:23:48,005 --> 01:23:49,590
as far as we're all concerned?

1584
01:23:49,673 --> 01:23:51,382
We're gonna get
to ride in a new car.

1585
01:23:51,464 --> 01:23:53,090
I hope it's a red car.

1586
01:23:53,173 --> 01:23:55,132
'Cause this
is gonna involve a...

1587
01:23:55,215 --> 01:23:58,630
Pretty big transition for us.

1588
01:23:58,713 --> 01:24:00,506
What's transition?

1589
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:03,089
I think it's the gears.

1590
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:06,257
No...

1591
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:09,923
It's more complicated than that.

1592
01:24:10,006 --> 01:24:13,340
It is not complicated!

1593
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:16,133
Jack is leaving you.

1594
01:24:17,007 --> 01:24:18,423
Jack's going
somewhere else forever.

1595
01:24:18,506 --> 01:24:20,631
He's leaving you,
he's leaving me.

1596
01:24:20,714 --> 01:24:22,798
He's going to another world.

1597
01:24:22,881 --> 01:24:26,132
Jack be leaving us where?

1598
01:24:26,215 --> 01:24:27,215
It's this job,

1599
01:24:27,382 --> 01:24:29,131
this other job
that I'm telling you about.

1600
01:24:29,214 --> 01:24:30,505
Jack, how...

1601
01:24:30,588 --> 01:24:32,048
How many jobs you got now?

1602
01:24:32,132 --> 01:24:34,047
I'll just have the one.

1603
01:24:34,131 --> 01:24:36,589
Us, right?

1604
01:24:36,673 --> 01:24:39,090
No.

1605
01:24:43,047 --> 01:24:44,297
Listen, Barry's right.

1606
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,463
I am leaving you guys...

1607
01:24:49,839 --> 01:24:51,089
But it's gonna be ok.

1608
01:24:51,172 --> 01:24:54,881
Someone else is gonna come
here and take my place.

1609
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:57,548
There will always be
somebody here for you guys.

1610
01:24:57,631 --> 01:24:59,881
But somebody doesn't know us

1611
01:24:59,965 --> 01:25:01,547
like you know us, Jack.

1612
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:02,215
They will know you.

1613
01:25:02,423 --> 01:25:04,590
Jack be leaving us where?

1614
01:25:04,673 --> 01:25:07,297
If you leave, Jack,
I'll go on a hunger strike!

1615
01:25:07,381 --> 01:25:08,756
No, just listen to me.

1616
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,840
Jack be leaving us.

1617
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,965
Let me explain this.

1618
01:25:11,048 --> 01:25:13,215
This does not mean
that I'm not your friend.

1619
01:25:13,298 --> 01:25:15,215
I just will not be
your worker anymore.

1620
01:25:15,298 --> 01:25:16,316
Someone else will do that job.

1621
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:17,340
I won't eat nothing!

1622
01:25:17,463 --> 01:25:19,590
Jack... and I mean this
quite frankly...

1623
01:25:19,674 --> 01:25:20,341
I would never quit you.

1624
01:25:20,674 --> 01:25:21,423
I am not quitting you, Arnold.

1625
01:25:21,506 --> 01:25:23,382
I am not quitting any of you.

1626
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:25,132
Lucien, come back here!

1627
01:25:25,215 --> 01:25:26,215
Lucien, come here!

1628
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:28,523
Let's stop for a second!
Just stop and listen to me!

1629
01:25:28,547 --> 01:25:30,630
No, Jack, you can't go!

1630
01:25:31,214 --> 01:25:33,338
Barry? Where's Barry going?

1631
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,149
We're gonna talk
about this in a minute, ok?

1632
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:37,006
Just let's talk
about it in a minute.

1633
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,357
Maybe we'll talk
in Russia, Jack!

1634
01:25:38,381 --> 01:25:39,881
That's where we'll talk.

1635
01:25:40,548 --> 01:25:41,797
I'll be right back.

1636
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,589
It's too noisy in here
for polite puppets.

1637
01:25:46,464 --> 01:25:48,923
Jack, don't leave!

1638
01:25:49,006 --> 01:25:51,215
Lucien, I want you
to go back inside, ok?

1639
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:52,298
Jack, don't leave!

1640
01:25:52,589 --> 01:25:54,023
I want you to settle down
and go back inside.

1641
01:25:54,047 --> 01:25:54,880
Nyet!

1642
01:25:54,964 --> 01:25:56,464
Arnold... - Nyet!

1643
01:25:56,548 --> 01:25:57,588
Against right!

1644
01:25:57,672 --> 01:25:59,631
Norman, put those back inside!

1645
01:25:59,714 --> 01:26:01,257
Free doughnuts here!

1646
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,006
I'm only gonna talk
about this...

1647
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:05,505
Jack, no, please!

1648
01:26:05,588 --> 01:26:07,841
Get your hunk right!

1649
01:26:07,924 --> 01:26:09,173
Free doughnuts!

1650
01:26:09,257 --> 01:26:10,548
Get free doughnuts!

1651
01:26:12,174 --> 01:26:16,966
Jack, no, please!

1652
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:21,130
I'll be back in a minute!

1653
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:23,214
Barry, stop that!

1654
01:26:23,297 --> 01:26:24,298
Stop it!

1655
01:26:24,631 --> 01:26:26,031
You want someone
to call the police?

1656
01:26:27,089 --> 01:26:30,755
Wouldn't that be best, Jack?

1657
01:26:36,963 --> 01:26:38,880
Free doughnuts!

1658
01:26:45,089 --> 01:26:46,089
Ok, Barry,

1659
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:47,840
let's just get you back.

1660
01:26:48,465 --> 01:26:49,465
Not yet, Jack.

1661
01:26:49,506 --> 01:26:51,631
We've got one more stop to make.

1662
01:28:10,881 --> 01:28:16,131
Barry, why didn't you
do that for your dad?

1663
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:18,382
Because...

1664
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,089
It would have mattered to him
whether or not it was a good shot...

1665
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:28,298
And it wouldn't have mattered
to you what kind of shot it was.

1666
01:28:28,588 --> 01:28:31,505
You're right.

1667
01:28:31,588 --> 01:28:36,215
All I wanted
was to see your shot.

1668
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:44,298
I think I'm all done now.

1669
01:30:12,922 --> 01:30:14,005
Good night.

1670
01:30:14,089 --> 01:30:15,006
Good night.

1671
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,131
Mr. Palmer?

1672
01:30:16,214 --> 01:30:17,047
Yeah?

1673
01:30:17,131 --> 01:30:17,880
For you.

1674
01:30:17,964 --> 01:30:19,006
Oh, thanks. Hello?

1675
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,091
Good, I caught you.

1676
01:30:20,173 --> 01:30:22,090
I just got off the phone
with Arnold.

1677
01:30:22,173 --> 01:30:23,214
Oh, my gosh.

1678
01:30:23,588 --> 01:30:24,981
He said to tell you
that he's talked with Norman

1679
01:30:25,005 --> 01:30:27,215
and Lucien and they've
decided to throw in with him.

1680
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,298
What does that mean?

1681
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,673
He said they're
all going to Russia.

1682
01:30:30,756 --> 01:30:31,756
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1683
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,756
Jack, he said
they're going by train.

1684
01:30:39,714 --> 01:30:41,631
May I have
your attention, please,

1685
01:30:41,714 --> 01:30:45,381
to announce the imminent
departure of train 354,

1686
01:30:45,463 --> 01:30:47,090
the quiet life limited,

1687
01:30:47,173 --> 01:30:51,507
service to battle creek,
Toledo, Serena,

1688
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:54,048
and points north.

1689
01:30:54,132 --> 01:30:56,256
All aboard, please.

1690
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:26,257
Hey! Jack's here!

1691
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:27,257
Hey, guys.

1692
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,714
Hey, Jack.

1693
01:31:28,798 --> 01:31:30,548
Guess what I got.

1694
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:32,839
Um, a balloon.

1695
01:31:32,922 --> 01:31:35,464
You be smart.

1696
01:31:42,714 --> 01:31:46,589
I thought you were going
on a hunger strike, Norman.

1697
01:31:47,965 --> 01:31:50,299
Jack, this is not a doughnut.

1698
01:31:50,383 --> 01:31:53,006
You got me there.

1699
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,130
Hi, Arnold.

1700
01:31:54,213 --> 01:31:55,796
It's good to see you, Arnold.

1701
01:31:55,879 --> 01:31:57,214
Hi, Jack.

1702
01:31:57,297 --> 01:32:00,214
You taking a train somewhere?

1703
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:01,672
No.

1704
01:32:03,005 --> 01:32:05,927
No, I just thought I'd come down
and see if you guys wanted any company.

1705
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:10,798
We're waiting for them
to announce the Russia train.

1706
01:32:10,881 --> 01:32:12,382
Russia train.

1707
01:32:12,464 --> 01:32:14,589
How's Barry?

1708
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:16,922
He's as well as can be expected

1709
01:32:17,005 --> 01:32:18,797
under the circumstances,
I guess.

1710
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:19,546
That's good to know.

1711
01:32:19,838 --> 01:32:21,215
It's a shame
he can't go with us.

1712
01:32:21,298 --> 01:32:23,839
There's a lot of Tchaikovsky
in Barry.

1713
01:32:23,922 --> 01:32:25,422
I'll tell him you said that.

1714
01:32:25,505 --> 01:32:26,506
Jack?

1715
01:32:26,589 --> 01:32:29,965
You still be quittin' us?

1716
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:34,298
Yeah, Lucien.

1717
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:36,840
I have to.

1718
01:32:36,924 --> 01:32:40,256
I have to 'cause I got Rena
to take care of.

1719
01:32:40,339 --> 01:32:42,089
Rena.

1720
01:32:42,172 --> 01:32:44,881
Don't you like us anymore, Jack?

1721
01:32:44,965 --> 01:32:46,840
Norman...

1722
01:32:51,047 --> 01:32:53,423
It's not about liking.

1723
01:32:53,506 --> 01:32:54,798
I love you guys.

1724
01:32:54,965 --> 01:32:59,964
But sometimes you have to
let go of something you love.

1725
01:33:00,172 --> 01:33:02,339
It's just like a parent
has to let go of a child

1726
01:33:02,422 --> 01:33:06,755
even though they love that
child more than their next breath.

1727
01:33:06,839 --> 01:33:10,965
Sometimes you have to do something
just because it's the right thing to do,

1728
01:33:11,048 --> 01:33:14,423
even though doing it hurts.

1729
01:33:16,588 --> 01:33:18,506
We live in the real world, guys,

1730
01:33:18,589 --> 01:33:21,714
and that's a world
where people get hurt,

1731
01:33:21,798 --> 01:33:25,215
whether they deserve
that hurt or not.

1732
01:33:25,298 --> 01:33:27,630
All right, then fine, quit us!

1733
01:33:27,713 --> 01:33:29,381
But we hate you!

1734
01:33:29,463 --> 01:33:30,923
Curtain up, end of subject.

1735
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:33,798
I'm... I'm not hating Jack.

1736
01:33:33,881 --> 01:33:36,173
Yeah, well, you've eaten.

1737
01:33:36,714 --> 01:33:37,756
I haven't eaten.

1738
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,672
It tends to make people testy.

1739
01:33:45,714 --> 01:33:47,838
Jack?

1740
01:33:47,921 --> 01:33:50,839
You want to hold my balloon?

1741
01:33:53,422 --> 01:33:55,005
Guys?

1742
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:56,172
Huh?

1743
01:33:56,588 --> 01:33:58,840
I'm gonna see if I can't
hurry up that train of yours.

1744
01:33:58,923 --> 01:34:01,339
You've waited long enough.

1745
01:34:01,423 --> 01:34:02,923
Yeah.

1746
01:34:03,005 --> 01:34:06,966
Like he knows Mr. Amtrak
or something.

1747
01:34:10,588 --> 01:34:12,797
That's a perfect
traveling outfit.

1748
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,840
"Traveling outfit"?

1749
01:34:14,923 --> 01:34:17,214
When did this get to be
a traveling outfit?

1750
01:34:17,298 --> 01:34:21,547
This is 20, 40, 60,
70, 81, 82, 83, 84.

1751
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:24,048
I want 4 round-trip tickets
to anywhere back here.

1752
01:34:24,132 --> 01:34:25,132
It doesn't matter where.

1753
01:34:25,173 --> 01:34:26,922
There's a trip that needs
to be taken.

1754
01:34:27,005 --> 01:34:29,423
That's kind of weird.

1755
01:34:29,506 --> 01:34:30,507
Yeah, well...

1756
01:34:30,549 --> 01:34:32,672
You live long enough,
you get weird.

1757
01:34:33,257 --> 01:34:35,005
It's part of the deal.

1758
01:34:35,089 --> 01:34:37,047
Going to Milwaukee on the train!

1759
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:40,006
Going to Milwaukee on the train!

1760
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,630
Going to Milwaukee on the train!

1761
01:34:42,713 --> 01:34:45,005
You remember.
You got to be good now.

1762
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:46,839
I don't think so.

1763
01:34:46,922 --> 01:34:49,006
Laverne and Shirley
are from Milwaukee.

1764
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:50,673
Who are Laverne and Shirley?

1765
01:34:50,756 --> 01:34:52,547
2 girls that are from Milwaukee.

1766
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:54,798
Boy, you don't remember
things very well.

1767
01:34:54,881 --> 01:34:57,005
All right,
I'll go find a conductor

1768
01:34:57,089 --> 01:34:58,369
and find out
where our seats are,

1769
01:34:58,463 --> 01:35:01,755
and you make sure those
bad boys get on and find me.

1770
01:35:01,839 --> 01:35:03,630
Yes, ma'am.

1771
01:35:03,713 --> 01:35:04,798

Uh-huh?

Your balloon.

1779
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,423
That's for you, Jack.

Huh?

1787
01:35:38,173 --> 01:35:40,630
You do mean business.

1788
01:35:43,922 --> 01:35:47,672
Careful. Bye, Norman.

1789
01:35:47,755 --> 01:35:49,672
Tell me about keys.

1790
01:35:49,755 --> 01:35:52,714
Yeah. And doughnuts.

1791
01:35:52,798 --> 01:35:55,463
Arnold...

1792
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:58,006
I'm really sorry
you feel the way you do.

You quitting?
I'm hating. Period.

I hope not.

1796
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:31,090
Jack, I emphasize this!

1797
01:36:31,381 --> 01:36:33,755
You have better behavior
patterns than a lot of...

1798
01:36:33,839 --> 01:36:35,755
I repeat... a lot of people!

1799
01:36:35,839 --> 01:36:38,256
Free doughnuts anytime, Jack!

1800
01:36:38,338 --> 01:36:45,423
