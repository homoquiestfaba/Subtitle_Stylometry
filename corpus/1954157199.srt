1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,395
Come on, Dougie.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,492
I got it, Dad.

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,198
Catch it closer to your body.

4
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,968
That's it.

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,940
That's okay.
We'll try again.

6
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,170
That's the one, Dougie.

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,337
I got the ball.

8
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,778
Yeah, now throw it back to me.

9
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:16,849
I got the ball!

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,417
Who's gonna be in the big leagues, Dougie?

11
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,281
I'm gonna play baseball.

12
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,252
Pow! You see that?

13
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,879
Tell Mom what you're gonna do.

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,979
What are you gonna play?

15
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,649
I'm gonna play big baseball.

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,284
And you're gonna be the one, kiddo.

17
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,657
That's great, honey.

18
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,196
I wanna throw the ball.

19
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,788
Come on, Dougie.
Come back over here.

20
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,265
I want you to stay there.

21
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,427
I'll stay here.
You throw me the ball.

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,802
It went all the Way over there.

23
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,534
That's wonderful.

24
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,007
Now throw it back.

25
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:46,905
I want...

26
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,207
- I got the bat, Mom!
- Okay, Watch this.

27
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,578
Hold tight.

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,418
Keep your eye on the ball.
That's it.

29
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,455
I don't believe it.

30
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,458
Swing, batter, batter, batter.

31
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,221
Swing the bat.

32
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,352
Throw the ball!

33
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,158
Swing the bat.

34
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,693
Yeah!

35
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,896
Here, bat the ball again.
Good one!

36
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,496
- I hit the ball.
- You hit the ball, slugger.

37
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,802
I hit the ball!

38
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,810
Good one, Dougie!

39
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,638
Low and inside.

40
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,978
Mendez is one of the league's
great southpaws.

41
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,210
More sporadic today.

42
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,287
Last time these two teams met,
he threw a perfect game.

43
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,821
Here's the pitch.

44
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,687
Strike!
I don't know about that.

45
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,589
I thought that was a little high.

46
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,161
I think Gordon did, too.

47
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,026
The crowd's not happy with that one,
but Gordon's not contesting.

48
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,190
He's waiting for the big one.

49
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:47,931
Bingo!

50
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,201
It's going!

51
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,276
It's going!

52
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,843
IT'S gone!

53
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,101
Guess who?

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,445
Hey-

55
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,080
What is this?

56
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,278
- Are you gonna keep this stupid thing?
- Yeah.

57
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,911
- Why?
- Come here.

58
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,546
For this.

59
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,887
Stop it.
It tickles.

60
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,891
Oh, hey, I got you something.

61
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,985
What?

62
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,892
What is it?

63
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,264
Open it.

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,808
A bat?

65
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,478
Yeah, but look at what it says.

66
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,649
"Home Run 100, Doug Gordon."

67
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,250
It must mean a lot to you.

68
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,623
It does.
That's Why I gave it to you.

69
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,890
Thanks.

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,328
Well, all I've got for you
is some good news.

71
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,700
What, you're not gonna leave me alone
this Weekend?

72
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,036
No, but you're off the hook tonight.
Dinner's canceled.

73
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,578
My dad had to fly off to Tokyo last minute.

74
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,170
At least I could use the extra time.
I could put it to some studying.

75
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,647
You still cramming?

76
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,978
Do you have any idea

77
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,452
how many bones there are
in a single human hand?

78
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,715
No, Dr. Gordon.

79
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,814
Why don't you tell our studio audience
and all our friends at home.

80
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,222
How many bones are there?

81
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,294
Very funny.

82
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,591
Here we are today with Dr. Gordon,
preeminent sports physician

83
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,393
and doctor to the stars.

84
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,727
Dr. Gordon, is it true that

85
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,927
your lovely girlfriend Laura
was instrumental

86
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,802
in your early success as a student
of sports medicine?

87
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,843
Well, I would have to say it was more
her unwavering loyalty,

88
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,913
her understanding, and, of course,

89
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,879
her sexual prowess.

90
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,929
Honey?

91
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,723
What?

92
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,529
We're in a library.

93
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,433
There's nobody here.

94
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,698
Come on, nobody's gonna see us.

95
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,899
I'm not gonna see you again.
It'll be exciting.

96
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,976
Come on.

97
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,805
We never have any time alone.
Jesus.

98
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,777
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,240
Stupid.

100
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,319
It's okay.

101
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,445
I overreacted a little.

102
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,456
Well, I better get going.
I've got a long drive ahead of me.

103
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,690
Okay.

104
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,899
Call you later, okay?

105
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:05,804
Bat.

106
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,101
- Good luck with your interview.
- Thanks.

107
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,337
I'll call you as soon as I get there.

108
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,922
Hey, Dougie!
Where you been?

109
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,116
I was in the library.

110
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,658
Oh, yeah.
What's that?

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,455
You see that big building over there?

112
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,622
It's got, like, books inside it.
And people go there and they read.

113
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,529
Oh, yeah, I think I've been there
once or twice.

114
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,729
So, what's up, bud?
No big date tonight?

115
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,067
No, not for this guy.

116
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,834
Although Jay and Dean called.

117
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,431
They're throwing a big party
at the beach tonight.

118
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,412
- You're gonna have to tell me all about it.
- Oh, come on.

119
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,038
- The whole team's gonna be there.
- I can't.

120
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,344
Why? Laura have other plans
for you tonight?

121
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,511
No. Actually she's away
for a couple days.

122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,281
All right.
So you're a free man.

123
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,687
No, man, I can't.
I got tons of studying I have to do.

124
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,351
And I promised my mom
I'd go outwith her tonight.

125
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,485
Now it's your mother?

126
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,125
Look, man, she's not doing too good
since my dad died.

127
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,360
You know?

128
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,003
I'm sorry, man.
I forget sometimes.

129
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,337
- You all right?
- Yeah. It's cool.

130
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,241
- It's cool.
- All right.

131
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,540
Look, it's early yet, all right?

132
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,376
We Walk in and out, say hello.

133
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,246
Ten minutes, that's all I ask of you.

134
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,818
- I can't.
- Oh, come on!

135
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,648
Come on.

136
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,450
Ten minutes.

137
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,456
Please. We Walk in and out.

138
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,150
Well, you've been Working
your ass off.

139
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,524
- All right. Ten minutes.
- Yeah?

140
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,618
- Ten. That's it.
- Sure?

141
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,788
- Okay? I'm positive.
- All right. Good.

142
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,922
- All right.
- See you then?

143
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,227
- See you then.
- All right.

144
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,881
Hey, Doug! Yeah!

145
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,507
Doug!

146
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,108
Hey, Doug, did Laura find you?

147
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,210
Yeah, I was in the library.

148
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,515
Yeah, can you believe that?

149
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,454
Just like that she gets a call for Stanford.

150
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,718
One minute they're being aloof.

151
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,691
And the next thing,
they want you to drop everything.

152
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,422
Don't they realize we have lives, too?

153
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,464
I think it's a really big pain in the--

154
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,396
Doug.

155
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,697
Hey, thanks for getting me
into Lesher's class.

156
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,465
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

157
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,369
It'll be nice to have you in the class.

158
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,676
Just make sure you know the pulmonary
and cardiovascular systems,

159
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,746
'cause Lesher can be a real hard ass.

160
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,949
Did he tell you We're dissecting
a cadaver next Week?

161
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,280
I can't wait.

162
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,377
- Hey, what are you drinking?
- Cuba libre.

163
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,980
- Beer's over there.
- I'll see you later.

164
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,615
- I'll see you later.
- Nice, dude.

165
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,766
Here he is, folks.
This is Doug Gordon.

166
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,862
He is the breaker of records
and hearts alike.

167
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,937
- Cocktail?
- No, thanks.

168
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,943
You know we have a game tomorrow.
Remember?

169
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,445
Yes, but tomorrow
is a very long Way away.

170
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,775
Now...

171
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,611
I want you to gaze before you, Doug.

172
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,481
I want you to tell me what you see.

173
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,883
A reggae band?

174
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,653
Babes, Doug.
I'm talking about women.

175
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:17,694
Wait a second.

176
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,091
Pardon me.

177
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,861
I've been on Prozac for a month
and my thighs are swelling.

178
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,766
And I was wondering
if you knew anything about...

179
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,530
Hi, Doug.

180
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,204
Do I know you?

181
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,610
No.

182
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,306
But everyone here seems to know you.

183
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,613
Small town.
Baseball team, you know.

184
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,762
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

185
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,656
They're American Heritage.

186
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,358
All natural. No chemicals.

187
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,059
They're practically good for you.

188
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,240
I like your beard.

189
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,552
Oh, thanks.

190
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,779
Makes you look
kind of like Mark McGwire.

191
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,288
- You know Mark McGwire?
- Oakland A's.

192
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,119
229 home runs,

193
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,284
632 RBIs.

194
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,624
- You're into baseball.
- Obsessed.

195
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,898
- I guess you play.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,832
Do you go to Bellport?

197
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,598
- Second year med school.
- Last year pre med.

198
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,536
I'm Melissa, by the way.

199
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,374
Hi, Melissa.

200
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,521
So...

201
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,884
What brings you here?

202
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,220
I mean, you--

203
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,418
You seem above all this nonsense.

204
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,755
You don't like parties?

205
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,387
No, they're all right.
It's just--

206
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,591
Have a lot of studying
I should be doing.

207
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,725
And I have to write my MCAT soon.

208
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,997
Welcome to a new dimension in misery.

209
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,368
What's your major?

210
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,965
Major League Baseball, hopefully.

211
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,575
But kinesiology and anatomy.

212
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,342
Anatomy?

213
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,416
My favorite.

214
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,319
Okay.

215
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,255
So tell me about your girlfriend.

216
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,823
Who says that I have a girlfriend?

217
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,420
Oh, come on.
Guys like you always do.

218
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,193
Unless, of course,
they don't like girls.

219
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,161
What do you want to know about it?

220
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,171
Well...

221
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,501
How long have you been going out?

222
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,470
Three years.

223
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,135
Really?

224
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,941
Something like that. Yeah.

225
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,914
Serious?

226
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,848
Yeah, I guess so.

227
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,588
Thanks for the cigarette.

228
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,460
Hey, what's your hurry?

229
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,260
Excuse me?

230
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,529
The night's young.
Why don't we go somewhere?

231
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,333
- Like Where?
- Anywhere you Want.

232
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,942
I don't think so.

233
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,812
I mean, you seem like
a really nice person.

234
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,413
But, like I said, I'm seeing someone.

235
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,489
Then Why are you here
at this party without her?

236
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,115
She's got a big interview this weekend.

237
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,717
Stanford School of Journalism.

238
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,319
- Stanford?
- Yeah.

239
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,795
Impressive.

240
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,994
So how long is she gonna be gone for?

241
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,663
- A few days.
- Gonna miss her?

242
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,467
Yeah, sure.

243
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,008
Doesn't sound very convincing.

244
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,846
I should go.
I have a game tomorrow.

245
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,543
It was really nice meeting you.

246
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,380
See you around, slugger.

247
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,808
Shit.

248
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,509
You looking for these?

249
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,207
- Where did you find those?
- On the dock.

250
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,545
You must have dropped them.

251
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,279
- Thanks.
- Wait a minute.

252
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,787
- Are you okay to drive?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

253
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,450
I don't know.
I saw you drinking a lot in there.

254
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,083
Thank you, but I'm fine.

255
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,287
- Okay, touch your nose.
- What?

256
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,023
Come on, like this.
Touch your nose.

257
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,632
Very good.
Now with your tongue.

258
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,795
Very funny.
Can I have my keys, please?

259
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,373
You don't have much
of a sense of humor, do you?

260
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,305
- I have a terrific sense of humor.
- Oh, yeah?

261
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,877
Yeah, if I run down one more old lady,
I win a prize.

262
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,276
Now give me my keys, please.

263
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,713
My mother was run over
by a drunk driver.

264
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,827
Okay, so We're going with Pete.

265
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,427
I don't like him.
He's gross.

266
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,971
Doug?

267
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,944
Hey, I'm sorry about your mother.

268
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,986
I didn't know.

269
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,953
I was only kidding.

270
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,087
My parents are divorced.

271
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,888
You should have seen your face.

272
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,624
That's very funny.

273
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,576
It's a nice car.

274
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,737
It's my stepfather's.

275
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,836
I'm just borrowing it.

276
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,414
You know,
I didn't want you to think

277
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,711
I was some kind of princess
or something.

278
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,949
So Where is your dad, anyway?

279
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,785
- Alaska.
- Yeah?

280
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,359
I heard it's supposed to be
really beautiful there.

281
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,195
So you wanna fuck?

282
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,796
What?

283
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,495
Fuck.

284
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,697
If you like, I can demonstrate.

285
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,041
I already told you I have a girlfriend.

286
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,048
I don't know.

287
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,015
Let's see.

288
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,520
Your mouth says no,
but your body...

289
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,216
well, it's saying something else,
isn't it?

290
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,825
Number five.

291
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,223
Left fielder, Doug Gordon.

292
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,886
Batter up.

293
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,657
Come on, Doug.
You're up.

294
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,199
Knock it out.
This is the one, now.

295
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,995
Nice and easy.

296
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,575
Way to Watch it, Doug!

297
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,979
Way to Watch it.
Good eye!

298
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,750
Strike!

299
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,721
Gordon does it again.

300
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,586
That's the 44th of the year

301
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,886
and 101 for his career.

302
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,790
Way to go, Gordon.

303
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,453
And the final score today:

304
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,590
Bobcats 11, Express 10.

305
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,664
- Hey, Gary! Wait up, buddy!
- Hey, Robert!

306
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,175
Stealing more hearts, I see.

307
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,978
And here I was thinking
I was something special.

308
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,953
- What are you doing here?
- I'm Lesher's T.A.

309
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,752
What are you doing here?

310
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,919
I just switched from Beckman's class.
It was too close to practice.

311
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,962
Oh, so now you're following me.

312
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,032
Funny.

313
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,124
I suppose you'll be Wanting these back.

314
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,700
Oh, yeah.

315
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,570
You were quite impressive.

316
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,835
- Thanks.
- At your game today.

317
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,546
- You were at the game?
- That was some hit.

318
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,984
Yeah, if only this stuff came as easy,
I'd be all right.

319
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,644
Maybe you just need a tutor.

320
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,046
I wouldn't go that far.

321
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,057
I would, given your grades.

322
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,128
Oh, so now you're looking
at my grades, huh?

323
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,628
Hey, look, I'm having a problem
with my fielding.

324
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,392
Can you take care of that for me, too?

325
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,557
Oh, I'm sorry.

326
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,862
I didn't realize I was posing a threat
to your masculinity.

327
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,233
Who said you were posing a threat
to my masculinity?

328
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,067
Look, when you're through trying
to impress yourself,

329
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,506
I'll see you at my house, 7:00.

330
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,270
If the directions are too difficult,

331
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,743
my phone number's there, too.

332
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,279
Melissa.

333
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,508
Yes, Dr. Lesher.

334
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,982
Remind me to schedule
a meeting with Dr. Marcus.

335
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,314
Oh, really?

336
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,826
What?

337
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,831
Hi, this is Doug.

338
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,272
You know what to do
when you hear the beep.

339
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,308
Thanks.

340
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,934
Hi, Doug.
It's Laura.

341
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,239
Just thinking of you.

342
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,473
I'll try you later.

343
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,639
Say hi to your mom.

344
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,086
Melissa?

345
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,514
- Hi.
- m.

346
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,284
Something Wrong?

347
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,792
Yeah, I just having a really bad day.

348
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,021
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

349
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,291
Yeah, I'm fine.

350
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,766
Listen, why don't we just go
somewhere else?

351
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,166
At least we won't be bothered there.

352
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,171
Tricuspid valve,

353
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,038
carneae, tendinae,

354
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,636
and the lining is endocardium
and myocardium.

355
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,840
Good.
But don't forget the epicardium.

356
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,712
Yeah, right.

357
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,677
Hey, I really appreciate this--

358
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,189
you know,
helping me out like this.

359
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,088
Especially after--

360
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,922
Don't worry about it.

361
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,069
- Is this your father?
- Yeah, when he was young.

362
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,037
Long time ago.

363
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,801
Before he was married.

364
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,207
He loved baseball.

365
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,940
It's all he ever wanted to do.

366
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,844
He was good enough for the pros, too.

367
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,019
Just like you, Doug.

368
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,316
Why didn't he play?

369
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,062
He had a decision to make.

370
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,961
My mother hated the travel
and the lifestyle,

371
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,433
so she gave him an ultimatum,
and he took it.

372
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,702
He became a surgeon.

373
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,311
I'm not this open with everyone.

374
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,114
I don't know, it's strange.
I feel different with you.

375
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,855
I'm sorry, I should just shut up.

376
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,390
You know the other night?

377
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,587
In the car?

378
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,186
I'm not usually like that.

379
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,422
I don't know what I was thinking.

380
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,693
I guess I was just afraid.

381
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,738
Afraid of what?

382
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,945
Afraid of not knowing
what it would be like to know you.

383
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,980
To be with you.

384
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,417
Why don't you come in for a drink?

385
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,719
I gotta go.
I'll call you.

386
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,293
Are you up for sailing this Weekend?

387
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,297
It's supposed to be really beautiful.

388
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,764
I'm really busy.

389
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,780
I know this great little island.
It's just a couple of hours from here.

390
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,087
Do you wanna stay the night?

391
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,388
I have an extra set of pajamas.

392
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,521
Listen...

393
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,724
why don't we just lay low
for a little while?

394
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,095
I mean...

395
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,104
I wasn't expecting any of this.

396
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,502
It's just...

397
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,173
I got a lot of things I gotta figure out.

398
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,443
And...

399
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,540
I still have a girlfriend.

400
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,641
And I still don't care.

401
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,847
Yeah, but I think Laura might.

402
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,514
Laura?

403
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,148
That's her name? Laura?

404
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,131
Well, Doug,
if that's what you want, then go.

405
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,258
- Melissa, come on.
- Good-bye, Doug.

406
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,604
Hi, this is Doug.

407
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,149
You know what to do
when you hear the beep.

408
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,308
Thanks.

409
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,646
Doug, it's me.

410
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,778
It's 1:00.
Where are you?

411
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,788
I'll be up for the next half hour.

412
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,721
Please give me a call.

413
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,792
I don't know what to tell you, Doug.

414
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,332
I mean, if getting a little of this

415
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,026
is the worst trouble
in your life right now,

416
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,467
I don't feel sorry for you.

417
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,197
I'm being serious, man.

418
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,366
- All right.
- Ready?

419
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,443
What about Laura?

420
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,879
Nice.

421
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,379
That's the whole thing.

422
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,048
I know things...

423
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,486
are a little shaky
between you two.

424
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,183
It's not even that.

425
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,558
It's just Melissa is different.

426
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,229
I don't know.

427
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,964
I just don't know if I'm ready
to give it up with Laura.

428
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,768
I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes right now, pal.

429
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,470
Your pants--
I'd like to be in your pants,

430
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,137
but your shoes--

431
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,481
You look like shit.
What's the matter with you?

432
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,883
I got a call last night
from an old buddy of mine.

433
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,289
Mitchell James.

434
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,385
He's a top scout with the Giants.

435
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,726
He's agreed to fly up here
and take a look at you.

436
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,156
<i>When?</i>

437
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,704
Said he'd try to make
one of the next three games.

438
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,239
Now, he's coming up here to see you.

439
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,568
This guy can tell a difference

440
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,802
between somebody who's playing
up to their potential

441
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,141
and somebody who's just jerking around.

442
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,339
Got it?

443
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,784
All right.
Keep it under your hat.

444
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,655
Hey, Coach.

445
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,254
Thanks.

446
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,163
Hey-

447
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,469
- Hey, Mitch.
- Yeah.

448
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,810
What are you gonna do
when we graduate?

449
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,816
Work for my old man.

450
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,149
At the lumber yard?

451
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,254
Yeah. Why?

452
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,852
Nothing.

453
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,658
I was just wondering.

454
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,160
You coming or what?

455
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,238
No.

456
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,136
I'll see you tomorrow, man.

457
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:46,649
Hello?

458
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,083
Hi, slugger.
How's it going?

459
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,019
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

460
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,954
I haven't been feeling so great.

461
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,891
My parents are fighting like crazy,
and it's just starting to get to me.

462
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,553
- Anyway, enough about that.
- Melissa?

463
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,891
I wanted to know,

464
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,228
when would you like
to get together again?

465
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,857
How did you get my number?

466
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,162
It wasn't that difficult.

467
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,261
There is this thing called the phone book.

468
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,837
Look, hold on a second.

469
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,034
- Hello?
- Doug?

470
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,806
- I finally caught you.
- Laura.

471
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,313
Hi, baby.
Where have you been?

472
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,076
I've been trying to get a hold of you.

473
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,345
Look, just hold on a second, okay?

474
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,389
- Melissa?
- Who's Melissa?

475
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,355
Oh, just hold on.

476
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,918
- Hello?
- I don't like being put on hold.

477
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,658
Look, fine.
I'll call you back, okay?

478
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,462
Do you still have my number?

479
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,366
Yeah, I got it somewhere.

480
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,273
- Laura.
- Who's Melissa?

481
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,468
She's just a friend of my mom's.

482
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,808
- How is your mom?
- She's okay.

483
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,346
It's tough on her, though, you know?

484
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,814
She talks about my dad
like he's still around.

485
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,253
So how is San Francisco?

486
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,379
Wonderful.

487
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,252
I take it your interview went well?

488
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,986
It's official.
I've been accepted.

489
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,460
So how come you don't sound excited?

490
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,258
I'm going to be in San Francisco.

491
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,925
Yeah?
Well, you may not be alone.

492
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,296
What do you mean?

493
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,870
There's a scout coming to see me...

494
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,837
from the Giants.

495
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,101
As in San Francisco Giants.

496
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,641
When did this happen?

497
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,076
Coach told me about it today.

498
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,911
- Do you wanna get that?
- No.

499
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,985
I'd rather talk to you.

500
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,647
Fuck you, you bastard!

501
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,589
So, when are you coming home?

502
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,159
I'm leaving first thing in the morning.

503
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,956
I should get there around eight,

504
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,155
depending on traffic.

505
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,096
So, What, should I meet you
at your place?

506
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,570
I have a better idea.

507
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,502
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

508
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,803
- The library.
- The library?

509
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,401
Isn't that what you wanted?

510
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,275
No, that was different.

511
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,077
I've been doing a lot of thinking, Doug.

512
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,912
I mean, you were right.

513
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,045
I don't know Why I make
such a big deal out of it.

514
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,020
I know I have to change.

515
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,318
So the library it is.

516
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,222
Is there a better place to learn?

517
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,827
I'll meet you there.

518
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,955
Bye.

519
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,862
Laura?

520
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:16,934
Yeah?

521
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,497
I miss you.

522
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,740
I miss you, too.

523
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,638
- I'll be back soon.
- Bye.

524
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,889
- Hey, Doug.
- Earl.

525
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,294
- Doug.
- Hey, Earl.

526
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,491
Do you know what it took
to get this part?

527
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,897
Where'd you get it?

528
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,970
Never ask a cop about his sources.

529
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,665
You better take good care of that bike,
just like your father did.

530
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,240
I will.
Thanks, Earl.

531
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,242
Listen, tell your mom that...

532
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,437
Marge and I will meet her
at one for lunch.

533
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,513
- 1:00.
- Okay?

534
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,545
- All right.
- All right.

535
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,206
- Thanks, Earl.
- All right.

536
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,787
Earl said he'd meet you
at one for lunch.

537
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,858
Oh, good.
I do hope you're joining us.

538
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,755
Actually, Mom, I can't.

539
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,992
Doug, is there something Wrong?

540
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,493
No. Nothing. Why?

541
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,903
You just seem a little on edge lately.

542
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,600
It's not like you.

543
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,913
The coach said that a scout
from the Giants is coming to see me.

544
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,444
Oh, Dougie, that's terrific.

545
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,421
Maybe you should shave
this thing off.

546
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,821
Ma, it's not that big a deal.

547
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,893
You never know.
We're talking professional.

548
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,962
It's probably the Giants now.

549
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,505
- Hello?
- Is Doug there?

550
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,599
Oh, hi, Laura.

551
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,077
No, it's Melissa.
Do I sound like Laura?

552
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,477
I'm Doug's tutor.

553
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,481
Oh, Melissa.

554
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,278
Is he around?

555
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,286
I'm sorry,
Doug's not home right now.

556
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,515
He's not?
Do you know Where he went?

557
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,388
No, I don't.
He drove off about an hour ago.

558
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,858
Really? Are you sure?

559
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,258
Yes, I'm sure.

560
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,332
Would you like to leave a message?

561
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,798
No, that's okay.

562
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,573
Melissa.
Who's Melissa?

563
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,137
It's nobody.

564
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,575
It's just somebody I met at a party.

565
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,306
So Why did I have to lie?

566
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,816
I'm sorry, Mom.
I just didn't feel like talking to her.

567
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,321
Douglas?

568
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,391
Yeah, Mom.

569
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,551
Don't get yourself into trouble.

570
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,490
Oh, shit.
I don't believe this.

571
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,265
Surprise, surprise.

572
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,835
What are you doing here?

573
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,871
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

574
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,897
Why did your mother lie to me?

575
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,175
I told her to.

576
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,338
Why?

577
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,412
Because I said I would call you.

578
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,748
But you didn't,
so what's a girl to do?

579
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,484
So, what do you want?

580
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,754
Well, I made reservations for two
at Carmichael's tonight.

581
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,764
- I already have plans.
- My treat.

582
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:34,991
I can't.
Not tonight.

583
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,396
- When?
- I don't know.

584
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,991
Oh, I see.

585
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,037
So I served my purpose,
and now you're moving on.

586
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,664
No, that's not it at all.

587
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,207
Melissa.

588
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,926
You've got to shave that thing.

589
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,661
I missed you.

590
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,128
I missed you, too.

591
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,876
All I could think about...

592
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,238
was us.

593
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,901
What's Wrong?

594
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,298
Nothing.

595
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,939
What do you mean nothing?

596
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,203
- Aren't I--
- No, it's not you.

597
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,837
It's just- I don't know.

598
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,649
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

599
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,254
I'm trying, Doug.

600
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,052
Really.

601
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,594
I know.

602
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,947
We will begin today's class

603
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,347
by making a longitudinal incision

604
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,918
along the abdominal cavity.

605
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,783
You will remember from last week

606
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,155
the proper surgical techniques
of opening the body.

607
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,922
- And we will go through lessons...
- Why don't you have the honors, Doug?

608
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,090
...26 through 30 of the tutorial.

609
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,860
- Follow along through steps 11...
- Go for it, slugger.

610
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,960
...through 16,

611
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,801
and you will realize

612
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,273
that Makon's descriptions

613
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,900
are reasonably close to reality.

614
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,642
Are we ready?

615
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,684
It's easy once you get the hang of it.

616
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,999
Very good, Mr. Gordon.

617
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,731
Now identify...

618
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,204
this.

619
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:12,971
Gall bladder.

620
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,514
Gall bladder.

621
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,282
Very good, Mr. Gordon.

622
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,857
Now, tracing away
from the liver, you--

623
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,154
Strike two.

624
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,873
Watch the ball, Rich!
Take it easy, now!

625
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,141
Don't rush yourself!

626
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,216
Come on, Filipelli!

627
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,676
- Strike three!
- What?

628
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,015
You're outta here!

629
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,022
Okay, we'll take it.
Keep it up, Rich.

630
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,019
Son of a bitch has gotta be throwing 90.

631
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,322
He is.
I clocked him on radar.

632
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,192
- No shit.
- Come on, Gordon!

633
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,460
Come on, Gordon.

634
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,059
Let's go, now.

635
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,339
Come on, Gordon.

636
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,288
Ball.

637
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,947
That's the Way to Watch it!
Good eye!

638
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,263
Three!

639
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,216
Lucky pitcher.

640
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,117
Unlucky batter.

641
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,348
It happens.

642
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,058
Get dressed.

643
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,751
Judy's here.
Maybe we'll all go out.

644
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,629
Okay, I'll be a sec.

645
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,164
Meet you at your truck?

646
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,299
Don't worry.
You played well.

647
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,234
Last one, chief.

648
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,066
Didn't mean to make you jump.

649
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,333
Maybe you ought to switch to decaf

650
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,205
or meditate
or some fucking thing.

651
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,003
Lose something?

652
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,975
- Get out.
- Don't worry.

653
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,810
No one's gonna interrupt us.

654
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,850
Not unless they're a locksmith.

655
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,250
Look, Melissa, this has gotta stop.

656
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,946
Doug, you almost finished in there?

657
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,853
Judy and I want to get something to eat.

658
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,119
Yeah, look I'll be there in a minute, okay?

659
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,091
I'm just gonna take a quick shower.
Go ahead.

660
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,022
Doug, are you alone?

661
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,395
Yeah, why?

662
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,196
I have a better idea.

663
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,361
What's that?

664
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:31,237
Why don't I come in
and help you dry off?

665
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,866
Look, that sounds really good,

666
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,343
but the coach pissed at me,
and he's coming back in a minute

667
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,344
to talk to me, okay?

668
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,381
So just go ahead
and I'll meet you there.

669
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:41,642
Okay.

670
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,528
Let's go.

671
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,894
Finally.

672
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,695
I like it when you play rough.

673
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,771
Just get the fuck out of here.

674
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,601
Doug, what's Wrong?

675
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,437
Look, I just want to get
something straight with you, okay?

676
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,168
Melissa.

677
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,007
Don't be embarrassed.

678
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,775
It's a good idea to spice things up.

679
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,144
Otherwise, love will never last.

680
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,151
- There is no love.
- How can you say that?

681
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,586
- After everything--
- I'm sorry you misunderstood.

682
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,149
It's Laura, isn't it?

683
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,727
Yes, but I told you
right from the beginning, okay?

684
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,159
What does she have that I don't?

685
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,596
Look, I'm not gonna have
this discussion with you.

686
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,133
Well, I bet she doesn't have this.

687
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,327
That's not real, is it?

688
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,498
Now, what would be special
about a fake tattoo?

689
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,409
I can't believe you did that.

690
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,173
Why?

691
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,305
Because all we did was fuck.

692
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,941
We didn't make love.
We fucked.

693
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,917
And it didn't mean a thing.

694
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,487
What about me?

695
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,055
Huh? What about the Way that I feel?

696
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,784
Did you ever stop to consider that?

697
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,656
Huh? What did you think,
that I was just some slut plaything

698
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,127
you can do what you want with
and just throw me away afterwards?

699
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,027
I'm sorry that you feel this way,

700
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:05,568
but I suggest that you get on with your life.

701
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,631
Sorry I'm late.

702
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,633
- Judy's already gone?
- Yeah.

703
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,277
What happened?

704
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,573
I had to talk to the coach.
I'm sorry.

705
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,050
Hey, you can't hit one out of
the ballpark every time.

706
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,788
Scout might have been there.

707
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,221
Is that what's bothering you?

708
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,623
Yeah, I mean, if I don't start
hitting the ball soon,

709
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,354
then what's gonna happen?
I'm not gonna get drafted.

710
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,623
You'll get a hit, slugger.
You always do.

711
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,862
Why did you call me that?

712
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,936
What, slugger?

713
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,765
Yeah, you never called me that before.

714
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,066
So what?

715
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,132
Are you sure you're okay?

716
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,882
Yeah, I'm just--
I'm sorry.

717
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,382
I'm just being stupid.

718
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,447
Just a minute.

719
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,029
Your hell's broken.

720
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:45,896
Yes, I know.

721
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,299
- You must be Melissa.
- I am.

722
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,398
And you must be Mrs. Gordon.

723
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,067
It's nice to finally meet you.

724
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,577
What can I do for you?

725
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,169
I'd like to speak with Doug.

726
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,407
It's after midnight.

727
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,484
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is it past his bedtime?

728
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,409
Good night.

729
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,014
I really do need to talk with him.

730
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,149
Doug is asleep.

731
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,988
You can talk to him in the morning.

732
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,397
I want to throw the ball!

733
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,899
Okay, put your glove back on.

734
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,937
I'll stay here.
You throw me the ball.

735
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,369
Hi, Dougie!

736
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,105
It went all the Way over there.

737
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,202
That's Wonderful!
Good for you!

738
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,644
Okay. Here, Dougie.

739
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,043
I got the bat, Mom.

740
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,709
Okay, Watch this.

741
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:43,786
Mom?

742
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,447
- Keep a firm grip on the bat.
- Mom, what are you doing up?

743
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,854
You know, Doug,
your father really looks like you.

744
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,086
Or you look like him, I should say.

745
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,092
What the fuck are you doing here?

746
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:58,759
- What is wrong with you?
- I had to see you.

747
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,837
- How did you get in here?
- I have a key.

748
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,200
You have keys to my house?

749
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,706
Well, in case of emergencies.

750
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,470
Yeah?
Well, this is no fucking emergency.

751
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,807
- Well, I think it is.
- Why is that?

752
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,210
I have to talk to you.

753
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,306
Not now.
My mother's sleeping.

754
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,181
Oh, she's not gonna wake up.
Not the way she's popping those pills.

755
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,254
You should really talk to her
about her dosage.

756
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,583
Now you're spying on my mother?

757
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,590
Oh, now this must be Laura.

758
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,523
My, she's stunning, isn't she?

759
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,094
What the fuck do you want?

760
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,124
I'm afraid.

761
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,221
Afraid of what?

762
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,801
I was thinking about
what you said today,

763
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,200
about how we didn't make love,
we just fucked?

764
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,569
And then I thought,
hey, if he's got that kind of attitude,

765
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,575
then maybe he might have
given me something.

766
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,304
You think that I gave you something?

767
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,812
Why are you so sure that you didn't?

768
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:45,882
Me.

769
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,211
You're the one that's fucking around.

770
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,750
- You are Way off.
- Am I?

771
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:49,819
Yes.

772
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,616
The only other girl I've been with
in the last three years is Laura.

773
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,089
How do you know how many
people she's been with?

774
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,750
Laura hasn't been with anyone else.

775
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,328
Oh, well, she probably thinks
the same about you.

776
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,124
You know something?
This is bullshit.

777
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,993
- Is it?
- Yeah, I want you to leave.

778
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,226
Let's go.

779
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,238
I'm sorry.

780
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,642
I'm so sorry.

781
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,578
Oh, God, this is embarrassing.

782
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,654
I'm sorry.

783
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,455
It's okay.

784
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,996
Come on, now.
Don't cry.

785
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,664
Come here, kitty.

786
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,136
Come on.

787
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,896
Doug?
No classes today?

788
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,696
Let me guess,
you're taking a four-day Weekend?

789
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,670
Why is your shower running?

790
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,609
Wait a minute.
I was just going in there.

791
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,847
By the way, your friend
Melissa was here last night.

792
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,948
Kind of pushy, isn't she?

793
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:17,855
Who is she, Doug?

794
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,457
Doug?

795
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,496
- Douglas?
- Jesus, Mom!

796
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,369
- What happened to privacy?
- I want to know what's going on!

797
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,334
Doug, I hope you know
what you're doing.

798
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,465
Hello?

799
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,796
Doug, get over here!
It's the cat.

800
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,233
- Somebody killed your cat!
- What?

801
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:03,272
I can't believe it!
It's him!

802
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,136
- Okay, listen.
- What's going on?

803
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,869
Look, calm down.

804
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,810
All right, listen.
I'm coming right now.

805
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:18,413
Someone is trying to destroy my life.

806
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,759
She must have been
the one who did this.

807
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,100
Every time I turn around, she's there.

808
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,337
I can't get rid of her.

809
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,004
Melissa?

810
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,708
Judy tried to tell me,
but I wouldn't listen.

811
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,377
You told me she was
a friend of your mom's.

812
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,547
You lied to me.

813
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,762
Why is she doing this?

814
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,332
I don't know.
She's obsessed.

815
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,401
There's something really
fucking wrong with her.

816
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,636
Did you sleep with her?

817
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,416
Get out.

818
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,449
- I'm sorry.
- I said get out!

819
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:24,611
Look, it didn't mean anything.

820
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,916
You son of a bitch,
get the fuck out!

821
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,102
No!

822
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,602
Stop it!
Please, stop it!

823
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,068
Where the fuck have you been?

824
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,899
I mean, you're missing practices.
You look like shit.

825
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:16,972
What is it?

826
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,904
Look, I don't want to talk about it.

827
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:23,642
What, are you fucking kidding me?
You don't want to talk about it?

828
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,977
This is me.
Since when do you keep me in the dark?

829
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,409
I mean, there's something going on, obviously.
What is it?

830
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,679
You don't know shit, okay?

831
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,414
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I don't know shit?

832
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,285
I know there's something going on.

833
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,323
What is it,
you and Laura serve your time?

834
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,596
That's not funny.

835
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,127
When you two lovebirds get through,
We've got a game to play.

836
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,431
Suit up.

837
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,632
Somebody wants to see you.
Mr. Mitchell James.

838
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,643
Come on, Doug.
Show them your stuff now.

839
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,734
Come on, Dougie!

840
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,508
Come on, Dougie!

841
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,952
Don't push it, Doug.
Come on, let's go, now.

842
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,049
Slam it home, Dougie.

843
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,819
Come on, Dougie.

844
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,874
Come on, let's go, now.

845
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,745
Come on, Dougie.

846
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,245
Come on, slam it home, Dougie.

847
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,682
Hammer it home, Dougie.

848
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,644
He's just having a slump.

849
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,051
Mitch, this is Doug Gordon.

850
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,250
He's the kid I was telling you about.

851
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,122
Your coach has been badgering me all year

852
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,389
to come and Watch you hit the ball.

853
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,965
Sorry about the disappointment.

854
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,363
Every batter has a slump, Gordon.

855
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,800
But your stats don't lie.

856
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,796
But at the pros, We're just as concerned
with a man's character.

857
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,103
What else you interested in
besides baseball?

858
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,678
Kinesiology and sports medicine.

859
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,213
I figured it would be good to have
something to fall back on

860
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,112
just in case baseball doesn't work out.

861
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,310
That's some schedule you're keeping.

862
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,887
Yeah, it keeps me busy.

863
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,822
I like you, Gordon.
You've got high standards.

864
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,689
That's just the kind of winning attitude
We're looking for.

865
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,785
Great.
I'll try my best.

866
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,865
Yeah.

867
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,729
That's him.
That's the son of a bitch!

868
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,235
- Douglas Gordon?
- What?

869
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,101
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

870
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,573
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Hey, take your hands off me!

871
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,008
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

872
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:12,343
I didn't do anything.

873
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,847
I didn't touch her!

874
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,817
If you can't afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed to represent you.

875
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,114
Sick bitch.

876
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,584
This is bullshit.

877
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,522
God, how many times
do you want to hear this?

878
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,356
I was in my room studying,

879
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,657
I heard the television and
I went into the living room.

880
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,858
- And she was there?
- And you gave her a key.

881
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,025
I did not give her a key.

882
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,659
She made her own key
without my permission.

883
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,203
And, of course,
you had a problem with that.

884
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,330
Hey, look, I did not fucking hit her!

885
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,406
All right, fellas, I'll take it from here.

886
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,139
Well, if you want to handle
this piece of shit, that's fine with us.

887
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,475
Let's go.

888
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,627
I read your statement, Doug.

889
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,059
What the hell's going on?

890
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,893
She broke into my house
and she drugged me.

891
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:06,264
I never laid a hand on her.
I swear to God.

892
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,031
I don't know what the fuck
she's up to.

893
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,902
All they have is a restraining order on you.

894
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,999
I'll have you out of here
in less than an hour.

895
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,271
But you have to keep
the hell away from her.

896
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:17,573
Stay away from her?

897
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,511
She's the one that's following me.

898
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,880
Okay, okay.
Let's drop that.

899
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,855
Doug, I didn't want to have to
tell you this in here.

900
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,450
There's been an accident.
Your mother's in the hospital.

901
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,574
Mom?

902
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,972
What happened?

903
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,051
Mom?

904
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:01,820
She'll be fine.

905
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,949
We just have to keep
an eye on her for awhile.

906
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:10,324
In her condition, we can't afford
for her to try something like that again.

907
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,767
Try what?

908
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,296
She overdosed on Maluprim...

909
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,069
high-grade sleeping pills.

910
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,905
They were different from
her own prescription.

911
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,980
I have no idea how she got them.

912
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,851
I do.

913
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,193
I feel awful.

914
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:41,862
Wish you'd said something.

915
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,092
Marge and I have always tried
to be there ever since your dad died.

916
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,862
I know.
Listen.

917
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,296
She didn't do this to herself.

918
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,174
I know who did it.

919
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,013
So tell me.

920
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,784
It's that woman, Melissa.

921
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,354
Are you sure?

922
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:15,020
Laura, you've never been one
to back down from a fight.

923
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:18,597
There's something wrong here.

924
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:22,034
I don't think you can just blame Doug.

925
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,549
Five minutes.

926
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,905
Doctor Richard Nelson
was acquitted today in Seattle.

927
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,105
He faced charges of physical abuse

928
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,409
against his 12-year-old daughter.

929
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:43,383
Nelson's Wife Patricia declined
to comment on the injuries.

930
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,061
March 5th, 1994.

931
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,066
Prominent surgeon's Wife Committed.

932
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,898
Doctor Richard Nelson's wife, Patricia,
was committed yesterday

933
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,030
to the Woodrow Institute
by her daughter, Melissa.

934
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,641
Well, you're the first one, actually.

935
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:16,684
Since her daughter brought her
in here two Weeks ago,

936
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,949
none of the folks around here
can get a word out of her edgewise.

937
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,118
I'll leave you two alone.
Don't expect too much from her.

938
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,790
If you want anything,
I'll be in admin when you finish.

939
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:34,825
Mrs. Nelson?

940
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,709
Hi, I'm Laura Hutton.

941
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:44,473
I need to speak to you
about Melissa.

942
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,548
My friend may be in danger.

943
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,548
Mrs. Nelson, if there's anything
that you could tell me

944
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:56,682
that might help me
understand your daughter...

945
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:58,992
Did she do this to you?

946
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,128
Melissa...

947
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,432
Hi, Doug.
It's me.

948
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,770
I have to tell you something.

949
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,780
It's about Melissa.

950
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,079
Hello?

951
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,789
Anybody home?

952
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,557
Miss Nelson?

953
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,627
Miss Nelson?

954
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,227
Is anyone home?

955
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,301
The door was open.

956
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:51,134
Miss Nelson?

957
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,102
Is anyone home?

958
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:30,670
Earl?

959
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,047
Earl?

960
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,577
Earl?

961
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:02,664
According to the report,

962
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:06,502
Melissa had a history
of abuse problems with her father.

963
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,804
Looks like she settled the score on that.

964
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:12,981
You go with him.

965
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,913
He's gonna take you
to the hospital, check you out.

966
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,609
- I'll call you later, okay?
- All right.

967
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,820
Can I get you a ride home?

968
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,553
No, it's okay.
I got my truck.

969
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,226
Why don't you get some rest?

970
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,888
Someone will look after your mother, okay?

971
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:31,960
Yeah, thanks.

972
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,104
You son of a bitch.
Get the fuck out!

973
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,521
Hey! Over here!

974
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,857
Hey!

975
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,264
Over here!

976
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:57,042
Melissa.

977
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:00,881
Well, hello, you.

978
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,254
Did we have a little accident?

979
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,023
Looks like you could
use some help.

980
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,062
Melissa, don't fuck around!

981
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,824
What's that I smell?

982
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,562
Is that gasoline?

983
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:18,904
Wouldn't it be romantic?

984
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,806
Two lovers going up in flames.

985
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:25,368
Melissa, please.
Just help me get out of here, okay?

986
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,415
Why?

987
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,677
Do you want me to die here like this?

988
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,013
You know, you do have a point.

989
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,885
Having you die like this wouldn't be very...

990
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:37,759
fun.

991
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,336
You blew it, fucker.

992
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:39,011
With her attempt on your life, Doug,

993
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,419
we have hard evidence against her now.

994
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,617
I have the Feds on our side
and have contacted Interpol.

995
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:49,096
They have traces on her credit cards,
bank accounts, you name it.

996
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,666
She makes a move,
we'll know about it.

997
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,861
And if you don't start taking
care of yourself, I'll know about it.

998
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,906
Marge said you went to work
a week early.

999
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,271
Don't you worry about anything.

1000
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,475
Doug, would you follow me out, please?

1001
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,416
You keep an eye on your mother, okay?

1002
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,118
- I will.
- I know you will.

1003
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,376
- I'm just here to see your mother.
- Can I talk to you?

1004
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,001
I have nothing to say.

1005
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,477
Look, I have something to say.

1006
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,377
Please.

1007
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,184
I fucked up.

1008
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:49,687
I fucked up like I never fucked up
before in my life.

1009
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,593
I made a mistake,
and I'm paying for it.

1010
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:58,557
But she set me up.

1011
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,067
She almost killed my mother
and she almost killed me.

1012
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:04,162
Laura, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1013
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,974
And it kills me to think
that I threw it away.

1014
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,673
I never meant to hurt you.

1015
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,279
I'm so sorry.

1016
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,450
I love you.

1017
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,096
Nice furniture.

1018
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,962
Yeah, it's my roommate, Lisa's.

1019
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,463
Hey, look.

1020
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,199
A VCR that actually has the correct time.

1021
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,569
No more blinking 12:00.

1022
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,169
What would I do without you?

1023
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:19,805
Thanks.

1024
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,512
Well, I guess I'll see you in
a couple Weeks

1025
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,554
when I come back for try-outs.

1026
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,452
Well, I better hear from you before then.

1027
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:29,785
You will.

1028
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:34,887
You know, this is a big place.
You sure you don't want me as a roommate?

1029
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,658
I just need some time.

1030
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,229
I got you.

1031
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,106
- Bye.
- Bye.

1032
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,519
Yeah?

1033
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,255
Hold on.

1034
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:13,628
You Doug Gordon?

1035
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,464
Phone.

1036
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:21,904
Yeah, hello?

1037
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,669
How's try-outs, slugger?

1038
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:28,214
Melissa?

1039
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,046
You remembered my voice.
How sweet.

1040
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,985
And after all this time.

1041
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,048
- Where are you?
- Oh, come on.

1042
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,150
The last thing I need
in my life is more cops.

1043
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,198
Who said anything about the cops?

1044
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,427
Well, then, Why are you so concerned
about my whereabouts?

1045
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,805
- I want to see you.
- You're lying.

1046
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:53,875
It's true.

1047
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,878
I can't stop thinking about it.

1048
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:04,311
The first night in the car?

1049
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:06,577
The boat.

1050
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,192
I close my eyes,
and all I see is you.

1051
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:15,754
Melissa?

1052
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,060
I can't stop thinking about it, either.

1053
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,533
Are you in Washington?

1054
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,104
Why do you care?

1055
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,969
Because I want to be there...

1056
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,473
with you.

1057
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,271
They're looking for me.

1058
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,640
We'll have to be careful.

1059
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:32,338
I understand.

1060
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,415
Are you sure you want to do this?

1061
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,150
I do.

1062
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,379
- Okay, swear.
- I swear.

1063
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,251
Now swear on Laura's life.

1064
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,592
Look, Melissa, do you want
to be with me or not?

1065
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,251
Only if you swear on Laura's life.

1066
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:47,726
I swear.

1067
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,887
Say the whole thing.

1068
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,465
I want to be with you, Melissa.
I swear on Laura's life.

1069
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,760
That's better.

1070
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:57,930
Now tell me where you are.

1071
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,302
No, I'll come for you.

1072
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,486
Hello?

1073
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,357
Yeah, hi.

1074
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:22,452
What's the matter?

1075
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:24,988
She's back.

1076
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,499
Well, did you call the police?

1077
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:27,693
Yeah, I did.

1078
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:31,762
Just be really careful, okay?
I mean, lock your doors and shit.

1079
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,898
I think you're being just
a little bit paranoid.

1080
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,534
I mean, she couldn't possibly
have any idea Where I am.

1081
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:37,839
All right?

1082
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,712
Yeah, okay.

1083
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,113
So relax.

1084
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,583
Yeah, all right.
I'm sorry.

1085
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:49,054
Oh, wait, hold on.
I was just making some tea.

1086
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,125
Oh, here, my roommate wants to say hello.

1087
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:52,989
- Laura--
- Doug, be nice!

1088
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,187
Just say hello.

1089
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,297
Hi, slugger.

1090
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,805
- Melissa--
- Did I overhear correctly?

1091
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,033
You called the police?

1092
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,133
If you hurt her,
I will fucking kill you!

1093
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,974
Oh, well, Doug,
you swore on her life,

1094
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,208
so I guess the hall's in my court now.

1095
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:33,264
Doug said to say good-bye.

1096
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,567
Oh, I wanted to talk to him.

1097
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:38,605
He said to say good night.

1098
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:41,039
He has to go to bed early.
Something about try-outs tomorrow.

1099
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,810
That sounded close.

1100
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,911
I hate thunderstorms.

1101
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,578
Ever since I was a child.

1102
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,814
Me, too.

1103
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,189
Oh, great.

1104
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:02,456
Oh, that's okay.

1105
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,759
I think there are some candles
around here somewhere.

1106
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,229
Sounded nice.

1107
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:12,363
Huh?

1108
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,441
Doug.

1109
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,543
Yeah, he is.

1110
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:20,809
We're just trying to iron out a few things,

1111
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,884
but we really love each other.

1112
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,781
That's nice.

1113
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,183
Three years?

1114
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,687
God, I envy you.

1115
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:31,053
I was in love once,

1116
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,855
but his heart
was in another place.

1117
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,136
So what is it that you're
trying to work out?

1118
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,200
- I don't--
- What did he do?

1119
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,368
Fuck some other girl?

1120
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:53,713
Excuse me?

1121
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,477
Did he put his cock
somewhere he shouldn't have?

1122
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,551
I think I'm gonna go find a flashlight.

1123
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:10,158
Lisa?

1124
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,723
Lisa, open up!

1125
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:14,028
The door's stuck!

1126
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,165
You scared the shit out of me.

1127
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,002
Lisa?

1128
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,505
Why don't we talk about
Doug's other girlfriend?

1129
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:43,761
I'm at the address right now.

1130
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:22,228
- Good evening, Miss.
- Hello, officer.

1131
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:24,802
Can I help you?

1132
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,397
Yeah, I received a call
about a disturbance.

1133
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:28,476
You did?

1134
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,373
Anyone else here besides yourself?

1135
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,111
No, just me.
I'm all alone.

1136
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:37,480
There's nothing wrong except
that I got a little scared.

1137
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:38,552
All the lights went out.

1138
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:40,280
Yeah, I know.
The whole neighborhood's down.

1139
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,321
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1140
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,087
Well, just the same,
maybe I should check the house.

1141
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,323
Sure, if you Want.

1142
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,270
I love old houses.

1143
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,603
Yeah, me, too.

1144
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,917
What's in here?

1145
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,455
Oh, that's my roommate's storage space.

1146
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,650
She has the keys.
She went out to the movies tonight.

1147
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:18,817
Oh, yeah.

1148
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:35,108
Well, I'll be.
Wife's got the exact same vase.

1149
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:45,016
Laura, you're awake.

1150
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:49,418
Good, 'cause We're gonna
play a little game.

1151
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,126
You like games, Laura, don't you?

1152
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:54,388
Now, here's how we play.

1153
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:57,932
First, we make a list

1154
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,763
of all the Wonderful things
that you have that I don't.

1155
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:02,796
And then...

1156
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,273
And then...

1157
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,572
we remove them...

1158
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:12,646
surgically.

1159
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,547
Now, Doug said something
about you having a kind heart.

1160
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:37,628
Laura!

1161
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,269
Fuck you, you bastard!

1162
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,433
You think you can fuck me!

1163
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,135
You fucking bastard!

1164
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:52,771
How do you like it?

1165
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,076
Fuck you!

1166
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:56,775
God damn you!

1167
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:01,279
Where is she?

1168
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:04,290
I'm not fucking around with you!
Where is she?

1169
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:06,883
Gonna shoot me now, Doug?

1170
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,622
I will fucking kill you.

1171
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:09,788
Where is she?

1172
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:12,196
You're a killer now, is that it?

1173
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,597
Well, you know,
guns are pretty messy.

1174
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:14,998
You sure you can handle it?

1175
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:19,631
'Cause it might be kind of hard
without these.

1176
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,458
It's gonna be okay.
