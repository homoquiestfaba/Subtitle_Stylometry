Obviously you like his equipment

burrs, chickens, eagles,
bricks, boulders,

175
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,933
cake, weight, hard, soft.

176
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,834
However you want it, nigger.

177
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,936
Fish scales! Whatever.

178
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,938
Just hit me on my Blackberry.

179
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,876
See? Y'all getting too old
for this shit.

180
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,178
What do you want?
You fixing to get on my nerves.

181
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,382
You breaking my concentration.

182
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,618
Y'all know tonight's the night,
right?

183
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,987
No. To do what?

184
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,025
I do that big show over
at the Mercy Theatre tonight.

185
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,160
Well, what do you do?

186
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,299
l'm a promoter, Momma.

187
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,005
Me and Jellyroll, we been doing
this for, like, four years now.

188
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,575
Well, you must not be any good.
Why we ain't heard about the show?

189
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,512
'Cause y'all are too old
to be worried about hip-hop.

190
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,050
Y'all need to be worried about
when Al Green coming to town.

191
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,987
Well, can l tell you no
right now before you ask,

192
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,486
'cause l know what you want.

193
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,823
Come on, Momma. Look.

194
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:45,929
All l need is a one-day loan,
the kind you be giving out.

195
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,263
How short are you?

196
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,033
Now, l got to pay for the building,

197
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,801
l got to get the hotels,

198
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,536
and, you know, these rappers
be having all kind of requests,

199
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,240
so, you know,
we about 9500 in the hole.

200
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,876
Ninety-five hundred!

201
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,549
Why don't you spend your Aruba money
instead of wasting it on Aruba?

202
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,485
Now, you know
i cannot spend that money.

203
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,252
That's my wedding money, okay?

204
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,056
lf l spend the Aruba money,
ain't no reason to go to Aruba,

205
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,857
'cause Loli ain't gonna
marry me anyway.

206
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,425
What's wrong with being single?

207
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,426
I ain't never been married,
and I'm cool.

208
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,736
Momma, you got to stop hating
on my relationship.

209
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:29,138
You sound like a bitch.

210
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,205
No! The answer is no.

211
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:34,410
Me and Ms. Ann got
to re-up tonight, Mr. Promoter,

212
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,244
so think of a new one.

213
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,014
Just because l told you
your daddy might be Don King

214
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:43,053
don't mean you gotta be running around
acting like you some damn promoter.

215
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,257
Well, maybe it's just in my blood.

216
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,424
Yeah, well, whatever.

217
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,161
See you at church tomorrow.

218
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,529
See y'all at church.

219
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,410
- Hey, baby.
- Drive!

220
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,346
- What's the matter?
- Drive, man!

221
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,914
- What's going on?
- Would you drive?

222
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,016
It's going down around here.

223
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,484
What's the matter?

224
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,122
Oh, man, that nigger Ronnie Stixx
tried to kill me again.

225
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,957
You fucking all on his wife, man.

226
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,194
But not all the time.
Every now and then I'm hitting it.

227
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,628
- Still hitting that.
- What's happening?

228
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,299
I'm gonna need half
of your money by show time,

229
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,299
or at least by sound check, man.

230
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,170
This building owner is on my ass.

231
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,873
Every five minutes he calling me
about that money.

232
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,008
Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

233
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,276
- You got your half?
- I got my half.

234
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,679
- Cool, cool.
- When you gonna have yours?

235
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,115
After I go pick them up from the hotel,
I'm gonna have my half.

236
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,715
What the ticket sales looking like?

237
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,952
Ticket sales ain't doing too good.

238
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,388
- What?
- Shit, we in Modesto.

239
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,289
Everybody know
this is a walk-up town.

240
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,690
This is a word-of-mouth town.

241
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,394
Word of mouth
you know what I mean?

242
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,798
That's just how the town is.
This is Modesto, man.

243
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,868
This is where people come
when they on the run from the police.

244
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,385
All right, man.
Keep your ass in the car.

245
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,086
You know you're in the computer.

246
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,199
- May i help you?
- Hey, hey, hey.

247
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,534
Hey, there, Chris.

248
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,338

called Russell Redds, Inc.,

249
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,275
and we got
a 15-passenger van reserved.

250
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:51,415
The confirmation number is B2TT54.

251
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,814
Okay, Mr. Redds.

252
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,084
I'm gonna need a credit card
and driver's license.

253
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,784
Of course you do.

254
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,121
Got that right here.
How are you doing?

255
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,689
Good, good, thank you.

256
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,559
And did you want insurance on the van?
That is an additional cost.

257
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,794
Oh, yeah, you know,
give me full coverage,

258
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,662

259
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,631
Okay, let me set that up for you.

260
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,602
Set that up for me, Chris.

261
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,039
What do you mean?

262
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,474
We're gonna have to charge you
a cleaning fee.

263
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,477
A cleaning fee? I ain't never
heard of no cleaning fee.

264
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,578
The last two times
we rented you vehicle

265
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,883
- we found paraphernalia inside...
- What kind of paraphernalia?

266
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,218
Uh, marijuana.
That's what l have on record.

267
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,887
Look, you know what,
just to be honest, Chris?

268
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,290
The cabin smelled like marijuana
when we got it.

269
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,857
l'm just putting that out there.

270
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,996
- I'm just putting out a cleaning fee.
- Yeah, okay, whatever, man.

271
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,332
Oh, and this credit card is maxed out.
Do you have another one?

272
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,666
- Wait a minute, man. l can't be--
- That's--

273
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,137
All right, man. Shit.

274
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,475
Try this one, and then
if that don't work, try that one.

275
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,176
Interesting.

276
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,247
Y'all throw in the navigational system
with that too.

277
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,116
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we want that.

278
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,683
- We want all that.
- You got it.

279
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,085
Thank you.

280
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,956
Where that little cute thing
that used to work here?

281
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,024
She's gone. We found
marijuana in her car too.

282
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,959
She probably the one
who put the shit in my van,

283
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,860
but l ain't gonna say
nothing about that.

284
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,402
PERCY: Let's do this, old man.

285
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:57,171
C.W.: Modesto, baby!

286
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,141
PERCY: Do what it do!

287
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,577
JEEZY: Where that weed at?

288
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,245
Yeah, man, I'm wondering

289
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,715
what kind of females
they got out here in Modesto.

290
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,551
Let's get this money first.
Worry about them broads later.

291
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,586
I'm trying to--

292
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,921
Modest-hos!

293
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:14,987
Hey, smile, dog.

294
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:19,262
They act like they ain't never
seen no black people out.

295
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,832
No, what it is, they ain't
never seen no rich black folk.

296
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,366
Ain't but one of us rich.
What they looking at you for?

297
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,967
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

298
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,369
WOMAN: Oh, my goodness.

299
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,507
Oh, it is you! Oh, my God!

300
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,275
Can l get an autograph?

301
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,680
Take a picture, get a hug?
Hook me up with a CD!

302
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,349
If you were to pump your brakes
and introduce yourself to me,

303
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,752
his road manager, Young Percy,
I could've hooked you up.

304
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,223
That's cool, that's cool, brother!
Can you take a picture of us? Great.

305
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,490
- And can I get a hug?
- Come on with it.

306
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,029
- It's all good.
- What are y'all doing here?

307
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,431
Got a show tonight.
That shit gonna be crazy.

308
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,733
- I know you heard about it, right?
- No.

309
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,372
Hey, take this picture, man,
so we can get the fuck outta here.

310
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,071
Yes! Take your picture.

311
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,942
Yeah, that's what's up.

312
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,550
Well, look, why don't you
call me later if you get a little bored.

313
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,785
Here you go. Take that.

314
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,154
I'm always backing that up, hey!

315
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,824
That's how you pull a bitch
in Modesto, man.

316
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,825
Yeah, whatever, man.
She was giving me a little rub.

317
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,527
You saw, like, all on that nigger.

318
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,796
Fuck that, bro.
Where the motherfucking car at?

319
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,064
l don't know where
these dumb-ass promoters are.

320
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,599
Let me try to get him on the phone.

321
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,236

329
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:02,599
I talked to my chauffeur 20 minutes ago.
He said he was on his way.

330

Listen, man, you got the hottest rapper

00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,955
Fuck it. We gonna do it big.

00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:15,417
Sure it's his ass.
We gonna kill him together.

512
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,021

513
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,157
I heard-- hey, man, that's--

514
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,426
D-BOY: No joke, man.

515
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,597
Get Jeezy out of the projects.

516
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,915
Jellyroll, where you at, man?

517
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,085
<i>Johnny G, at the Mercy, bro.
What's going down?</i>

518
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,585
- What up, Julio?
- What's up?

519
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,788
What's up is that
the ticket sales are down.

520
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:58,526
That's what's happening.
What kind of promoters are you? Huh?

521
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,595
Have you been pushing this on radio?
How many spots you got?

522
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,033
<i>We've been running spots
on V1O6, man, every 3O minutes.</i>

523
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,100
You don't even listen
to black radio, man.

524
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,501
You wouldn't even know.

525
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,038
Modesto's a big walk-up town, man.

526
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:15,010
Walk up. Listen, I need

00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,977

00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,451
Sound check is cutting it
too close, Russell!

531
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,452
I said i'm taking care

532
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,256
Don't call me again, man.

She gonna kill me.

539
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,149
Hey, girl.

540
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,051
- Hey, baby.
- What you doing?

541
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,787
Okay, i'm debating on
whether or not I want to do

542
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,056
the silver shoes or the white
shoes for the wedding.

543
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,893
I think these look too hookerish.
What you think?

544
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:41,862
Yeah, but l like hookerish.

545
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:45,100
I know you like hookerish,
but I gotta be able to walk.

546
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,002
ls your momma coming
to Aruba with us?

547
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,635
I don't know.

548
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,939
If she do, she gonna have
to sneak on.

549
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,508
- Why?
- You know she's still on parole.

550
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,980
- Three years ain't up yet?
- Nope. She going back too.

551
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,913
Why your momma
gotta be like Frank White?

552
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,416
I don't know.
She say it's in her blood.

553
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,352
Where's Semore at?

554
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,554
In the back, rehearsing.

555
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,156
All right.

556
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,767
How you doin'?

557
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,501
Y'all know what time it is.

558
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,504
Can you scoot up a little bit?

559
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,740
Hey, DJ! Ha! Let's go!

560
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,563
Yeah!

561
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,135
Yeah, real quick.

562
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,136
They know how it is, man.

563
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,505
You got it, man!
That's what l'm talking about.

564
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,440
What'd you think, honestly, though?

565
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,411
You looked good, boy.
They ain't gonna be able to handle you.

566
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,278
Modesto ain't ready for you!

567
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,946
Modesto ain't ready!

568
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,216
I like that, and guess what!

569
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,584
lI let Jeezy hear your demo.

570
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,653
For real? What'd he say?

571
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:17,326
I can't tell you that, boy.
You might go jack-in-the-box on me.

572
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,824
All right, bitches.

573
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,495
You looking at Modesto's finest.

574
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,828
Take it from the top. Let's go!

575
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,830
Hey, wait a minute. Hold up.

576
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,634
How much are we

577
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,102
Y'all ain't gettin' nothing.

578
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,605
Exactly, so don't call me
a motherfucking name.

579
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,940
My name is Sandra,
and that's my girl Keisha.

580
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,341
Can you get the shit right?

581
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,210
Yeah, look, l'm sorry, all right?

582
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,579
Okay, take it from the top,

00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,015

00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,014
Damn, son!

599
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,321
Keep that ass in line.

600
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,155
All right, let's go!

601
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,190
DJ, spin it back.
Let's go, come on!

602
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,730
- Hey, now.

603
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,866
- Come on, girl.
- Baby, it's hot. Come on.

604
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,934
- l need your help.
- Right now?

605
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,938
Yeah, I gotta blow up
a couple balloons before the show.

606
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,307
Don't you see me
cleaning this table?

607
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,308
Baby, it's only a couple.

608
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,110
Come on.

609
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,087
Hold on, tiger.

610
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,094
Oh, yeah, baby.

611
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,727
Damn!

612
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,941
Yeah!

613
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,994
- This is shit, man!
- How's everything?

614
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,297
I finally got them down here.

615
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,365
This a no-star hotel.

616
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,500
Ooh, is that him?

617
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,636
I think that's Jeezy right
there, girl.

618
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,105
I think I can see
the tattoo on his neck.

619
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,707
Double-R Incorporated.
Russell Redds.

620
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,209
What's this bullshit, Russell?

621
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,443
What you mean?

622
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,445
We supposed to get
a five-star hotel,

623
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,216
like the Hyatt Regency,
Doubletree, something classy.

624
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,949
l can't even get dude
out the van.

625
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,221
l know that. l know you all
were supposed to be over at the Hyatt,

626
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,289
but when l called
they was all sold out,

627
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,326
and over at that Doubletree,
they got that police--

628
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,327
They got some kind
of police convention.

629
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,496
- Retirement party.
- You don't wanna go there.

630
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,499
l know y'all be doing your thing
and don't wanna be over there.

631
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:16,003
This right here, the Cloud G,
is actually one of the best hotels...

632
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,403
BOTH: ...in Modesto.

633
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,239
Me and Jellyroll stay here
all the time.

634
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,773
I got married here, man.

635
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,176
And we got you that discount rate
l was talking about.

636
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,946
Yeah, 'cause Martin Luther King
probably got shot here.

637
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,749
You know what, a nigger
named King Luther got shot

638
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,517
up there in 313 one night.

639
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,752
Some shit jumped out,
got real ugly...

640
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,023
You know what, man?
I'm calling the Hyatt.

641
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,425
- You're wasting your time.
- MICHELLE: I think that's him.

642
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,560
I wanna let him beat on this box.

643
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,794
Ooh, shit!

644
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,696
I like that little one right there.

645
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:47,201
With the big old booty?
I guess, if that's what you like.

646
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,467
They're overpriced,

647
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,171
and they didn't have
the presidential suite you asked for.

648
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,440
You saying they have my suite?

649
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,808
No, they didn't have your suite.
They got it over here.

650
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,144
- They got the Jacuzzi...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

651
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,547
We'll talk about that later, okay?

652
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,283
- What we need to do is get the keys...
- Gonna get the keys--

653
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,021
We're gonna get the keys,
and l get him to his room,

654
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,890
- 'cause he's tired, you know.
- Do what you're gonna do, man.

655
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,025
Shut the fuck up.
I'm talking to Russell.

656
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,693
This nigger think l'm the driver?

657
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,862
Make sure I get
that presidential suite ASAP.

658
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,899
- I'll get you the presidential suite.
- With a Jacuzzi?

659
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,800
- I hooked you up.
- That's what's up.

660
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,302
Help me with the bags, please.

661
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:27,107
That nigger act like he got
an album coming out.

662
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:30,812
The road managers,
they prima donnas.

663
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,746
- You ovulating?
- Yes, I am!

664
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,747
Girl, me too, girl.
We gonna get paid.

665
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,885
Now, fix your titties.
Yeah, let's do this.

666
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,547
Hell, no, man.

667
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,789
Fuck!

668
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,793
Oh, be having bottles!

669
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,328
Shit.

670
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,301
Thank you, Jeezy, for going platinum.

671
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,205
Let me call the man.

672
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,543
How your room?

673
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:39,278
<i>It's crazy in here.
What do you mean, how's my room?</i>

674
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,482
My shit whack too, dog.
Yeah, dreadful.

675
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,817
<i>- Let's go to sound check.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

676
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,952
I'm gonna check on that
and hit you back.

677
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,287
Hurry up, man.
Got a fucked-up room.

678
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,559
- Don't trip, man. My shit whack too.
- Let's go to the ventte,

679
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,597
Aw, yeah.

680
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,665
Me likey.

681
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,670
Wanna go to the room?

682
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,873
Ha! Yeah. Sweet.

683
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,774
Yeah, that's how we do it.

684
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,745
I spent a grip over at Gino's
on the way here.

685
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,913
You need to go to the mall.

686
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,151
You're probably gonna wear
that ugly-ass Kurt Franklin suit.

687
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,653
They threw my son's CD
out the window?

688
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,688
Slung that out the window
like a Frisbee.

689
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,188
I thought a dog was gonna
catch it.

690
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:26,026
Catch that motherfucker
in the air.

691
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,929
But, no, I was mad too,
but don't worry about the CD.

692
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,633
This is what you need to
worry about.

693
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:35,603
Huh! Two Gs. Gator!

694
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:41,041
That's them preachers be tricking
them bitches in church with.

695
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,142
That's something special.
That ain't shit.

696
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,311
That ain't shit.

697
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,146
You need to look at 13 Gs.

698
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:50,719
I'm gonna kill 'em tonight, baby.
I'm-a kill-- whoo!

699
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,921
Damn! That's the showstopper,
right there.

700
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,923
Precision.

701
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,724
You need to get
your shit together.

702
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,927
- I need to get my shit together?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,028
I'm the one who taught
you the game, boy.

704
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,701
You might be able to out-dress me,
but never to out-think me.

705
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,400
Understand that, now.

706
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,837
I don't know where
you borrowed that money from,

707
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,339
but i don't want no bullshit
at the venue tonight.

708
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,942
I come from money.
I've had money all my life.

709
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,379
Looky here, man. Whoever you
borrowed that money from

710
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,015
gonna be bugging the shit
outta me to get paid.

711
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:27,856
What's up, Russell?
You taking us to sound check?

712
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,421
Yeah, let's go.

713
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,190
All right, man, get your driver.

714
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:34,094
Driver? You better be in a car seat
when you get in that van,

715
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,262
little Gary Coleman-looking
motherfucker.

716
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,617
Clean that good, girl.

717
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,294
Mike check. Mike check one.

718
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,395
Mike check mo.

719
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,164
One, mo, check.

720
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,100
Y'all got that?

721
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,780
Mike check one, mike check mo.

722
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,618
Russell Redds.

723
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,956
- Oh, goddamn.
- Just the guy l wanted to see.

724
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,824
Where's my money?

725
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,861
Man, l got your little
funky-ass $G500.

726
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,931
- 9500. Don't get cute with me.
- Whatever, man.

727
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,898
I'll meet your greedy ass
in the office.

728
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,800
Trying to handle this
goddamn show.

729
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,373
No cash, the house
doesn't open, all right?

730
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,675
Gonna take a whipping tonight,
boy!

731
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,011
- Whatever, man.
- You're going down, baby.

732
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,749
Yeah, your daddy want
his hat back.

733
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,248
Motherfucker.

734
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,623
JELLYROLL: ...on the seats.
You understand me?

735
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:13,461
Do you feel me? Do you feel me?

736
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,096
Look, Jeezy,
just give me a second.

737
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,932
Bring my Hennessey back.

738
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,532
I got you covered.

739
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:22,534
Damn! About to lose my job.

740
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:24,938
Man, how you not gonna have
no Popeye's chicken,

741
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,605
no potato salad, no Hennessey?

742
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,042
If it's a rap show,
you gotta have Hennessey, man!

743
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,676
Who are these goddamn promoters?

744
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,379
Don't they know l've been
working with the best of them?

745
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,049
I can't pay all of them.
I'll pay your light bill.

746
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,984
- At least you'll have--
- Jellyroll!

747
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,489
All right, i'm gonna holler
at you in a minute.

748
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,189
Up top, baby.

749
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,392
See you later.

750
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,098
- I need to holla at you.
- What's up?

751
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,768
Hey, brother,
i need to talk to you, man.

752
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:56,401
- What's up?
- Wait a minute!

753
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,905
Russ, what you need, man?

754
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,006
Hold on, Jellyroll.
Let me hear what he got to say.

755
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,576
Hold up, Russell. I think your
partner got a problem with me.

756
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:04,943
Yeah, you thinkin' right.

757
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,247
He the one that threw
your son's CD out the window.

758
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,015
- What?
- Him. Don't lie.

759
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,918
- Are you lying to me?
- What happened was--

760
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,253
- When we was in the car, and--
- You lying.

761
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,922
You look like a lying motherfucker.
What you want?

762
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,825
I don't know what's happening here,

763
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:21,593
but i'm focused on what we need,

764
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:24,397
and that's that Hennessey
in the dressing room ASAP.

765
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,731
Get the fuck outta here.

766
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,668
Can't you see us having
this conversation about the show?

767
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,906
- You talkin' about some Hennessey?
- Liquor, man? What the fuck--

768
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,572
I'll talk to you in a minute.

769
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,007
Scram.

770
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:38,345
You know what? Fuck it.
No Hennessey, no show.

771
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,212
Ain't got time for this shit.

772
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:44,018
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now, that's what Jeezy said.

773
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,285
You know, i mean,
i'm just the messenger.

774
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,824
If i was the rapper, I'd say,
"Can we have a Hennessey, please,"

775
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,592
'cause that's what's on the rider.

776
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,030
You tell that motherfucker Jeezy
that we'll think about it.

777
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,262
Yeah.

778
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,499
Okay, thanks.

779
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,969
- Hey, Percy.
- What?

780
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,605
Don't forget where you at, man.

781
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,307
You in M-Do now.

782
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,143
The 2O9, punk.

783
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:11,911
What's that supposed to mean?

784
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,314
Look, i'm about to go pay Glanville.

785
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,850
I need you to steal
that money back, okay?

786
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,686
All right, look,
here's what we gonna do.

787
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,725
Count this shit faster, man.

788
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,227
Hey, you know what?

789
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,296
Let me take my time here,
all right?

790
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,529
Jeez.

791
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,700
Five... 9,OOO.

792
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,568
Have a seat, Russell.

793
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,003
I'd rather stand.

794
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,241
Whatever you want, bro,
but you don't look too good.

795
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,076
Forgot to bring my medicine.

796
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:46,246
- You know l'm a diabetic, right?
- No, l didn't know that,

797
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:49,851
but l do know that you suck
at being a promoter.

798
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,018
I don't want to hurt
your feelings or nothing.

799
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,420
You're not gonna make it.
It's not gonna happen.

800
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,355
Look, man, some
of our shows worked.

801
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:57,622
Give us some credit.

802
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,460
But most of your shows
do not make money,

803
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:03,697
because you and Jelly Rat
don't know what you're doing.

804
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:06,166
- Jellyroll.
- Jellyroll, whatever.

805
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,501
What the hell's wrong with you,
man?

806
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,504
You all right, brother?

807
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,105
We have to call my woman.

808
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:15,107
She got to-- !

809
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:18,111
Hey. Hey, Russell! Russell!

810
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:22,214
Russell! Russell. Russell.

811
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:23,782
Russell, what's up, man?

812
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,952
It's me, Johnny-- hey!

813
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,089
I need help here!
I need-- Russell, hey!

814
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:32,726
I need help! Shit! I need help!

815
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:36,230
Hey, Boyer! Got an emergency!

816
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:39,466
Boyer! Boyer!

817
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,902
Oh, no!
What the hell is going on?

818
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,305
- Dear son of--
- Get the money!

819
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,173
Get the fucking money!

820
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,907
Don't let him see.

821
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,977
Hey! Put that shit in your pocket.

822
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,183
Oh! Anybody seen Russell
around here?

823
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,183
He's having a seizure. Hold on!

824
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,085
Having a seizure where?

825
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,054
Oh, hell, no!

826
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,390
Oh, no! What'd you do to my man?

827
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,028
- I didn't do shit.
- Russell Redds! Russell Redds!

828
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:10,728
- He's asleep.
- He's snoring.

829
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,400
Yeah. See, when he have a seizure,
that's what he do.

830
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,769
He usually just go to sleep.
He's out of it.

831
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,604
Just leave him alone.
He's cool, yeah.

832
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,405
Want me to call the paramedics?

833
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,543
Get him a Capri Sun.
That's what he'll usually use.

834
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:26,179
A Capri Sun? What the fuck?

835
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:29,683
Russell Redds! Wake up, Russ.

836
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,016
- Wake up.
- I'm good.

837
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:33,118
Wake up. Right! He's up.

838
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,020
My boy, he's up.

839
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,125
You scared the shit outta me.

840
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,692
You don't need a doctor or nothing?

841
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:44,131
Everything's cool, baby.
He cool.

842

00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,304
Hold it a second!

845
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:52,972
What the hell happened
to my money?

846
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,440
What money?

847
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,108
Pat 'em down, boys.

848
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,242
Don't touch me.

849
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,647
I don't know where that
come from.

850
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,649
You're goddamn geniuses, huh?

851
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:08,554
The only reason you mo
are walking out of here alive

852
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,922
is because the show must go on.

853
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:14,161
Because if it doesn't
and those monkeys in there

854
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,797
<i>ruin my beautiful theatre,
ay, mamacita.</i>

855
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,898

of appetizer.

856
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,200
What's appetizer?

857
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,304
Come on, man! Motherfucker!

- Damn!

860
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,079
I knew that bullshit
wasn't gonna work, man!

861
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:35,748
It would've worked if you'd
just came and got the money

862
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,482
instead of trying
to get me off the ground.

863
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,384
<i>What do you think you are,
Gray's Anatomy?</i>

864

Look, Jellyroll, it's imperative
you don't spend that money.

867
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,698
This show gotta jump off, man.

868
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,466
Our life might depend on it.

869
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:55,633
Shit.

870
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,570
Hit me in my motherfucking jaw.

871

879
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,163
Hold on, baby, i don't fuck

880
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:27,434
- Okay, okay. l'll give you some.

881
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,866
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

You allergic to pussy?

Oh, thank God you came.
I told him to stop.

Did he? Come on, honey.
Let's go to security.

You are an animal!

903

00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,194
You getting a massage?
What's going on!

1008
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:11,929
Don't worry about nothing, Pops.

1009
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,868
I heard that Puffy,
Jay-Z, and Andre 3,OOO

1010
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:17,302
get at least four
or five massages a week.

1011
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,370
That's just how us rappers do.

1012
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:23,176
Are you crazy? Nigger, they rich!
They got money.

1013
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,609
You ain't got nothing.

1014
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,945
I got talent.
That's all the money l need.

1015
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,381
- Are you high?
- No, i ain't high.

1016
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,015
- Havee you been drinking?
- No.

1017
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,953
Look here, man, don't play
with me with that talent shit.

1018
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,223
I done told you already,
talent don't make money.

1019
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,357
Money make money.

1020
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,992
- I got you.
- Okay?

1021
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,794
All right, man,
but forget about that.

1022
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:44,796
Look here, man,
how many songs can you do?

1023
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,466
I got six albums' worth
of rhymes. Why?

1024
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,602
I need you to go on there
and do more than 20 minutes.

1025
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,605
I got it. I can go all night
if you need me to, just like Kanye.

1026
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:55,441
Look, i'm Yung Semore,
the crowd wanna see more,

1027
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,176
and they fiendin' for it,
i'm-a let 'em see more!

1028
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,980
Hey, yo, Big D.
Can you escort my dad outta here?

1029
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,415
You don't let nobody in here
without my approval.

1030
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:07,554
Nigga, nobody want to listen to me.
They'll learn. I'll start firing people.

1031
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:17,964
I still don't understand why we
had to park so far down the street.

1032
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,196
'Cause i'm the promoter.

1033
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,035
I don't want nobody to see me
pulling up in that Rent-a-Van.

1034
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:24,436
Ooh, Regina...

1035
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,104
I'm Jellyroll Entertainment,

1036
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,409
<i>and you looking like one of the
girls off The Flava of Love,</i>

1037
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,942
RONNIE: We gonna settle
this right now.

1038
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:34,347
It's your husband!

1039
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,281
Get down.

1040
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,457
Come on, girl, run!

1041
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,393
REGINA: I'm running. I'm running!

1042
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:52,632
RONNIE: Regina, l love you, baby.

1043
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:56,002
It's me. Oh, yeah, it's me.

1044
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,706
REGINA: Don't kill him! I'm sorry!

1045
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:02,975
Oh, baby, come back! Please!

1046
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:05,845
I just want to cuddle. Come on!

1047
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,645
Come back! Stop!

1048
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,988
Going down. Yung Semore's
in the building.

1049
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:19,459
I'm feeling good, i'm looking good,
and i'm smelling wonderful.

1050
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,992
RAPPER 1 : Yo, all right!

1051
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,097
- RAPPER 2: Tear it up.
- You ready, man?

1052
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:26,831
I don't know, Dad, man.

1053
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,833
I don't think l'm ready.

1054
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,336
All them people out there,
i don't know if they're feeling me.

1055
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,506
What happened to all that swagger
you had in the dressing room?

1056
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,507
I learned that from 50 Cent.

1057
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,178
Look, man, you can
name every rapper

1058
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:42,248
and what they had for breakfast,
but what about you?

1059
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,017
Man, you can't be no regurgitated MC!

1060
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:47,419
You got to be an original.

1061
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:51,558
The people, they want
an original, all right?

1062
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:55,061
Now, you Yung Semore, right?
Modesto's finest, right?

1063
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,794
Well, then act like it.

1064
00:59:56,894 --> 01:00:01,502
I'm-a go out there and announce
that Yung Semore's in the house

1065
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,539
and he about to tear
this motherfucker up, right?

1066
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,271
- Right.
- Right?

1067
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,140
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

1068
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,944
Stop acting like a bitch
and come on. Hit it.

1069
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,711
Ready on the curtain and a spot.

1070
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,883
All right, remember what i told you?
Clap, clap, clap.

1071
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,885
Hey, now. Yo, yo.
What's up, Modesto!

1072
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,820
How y'all doing?

1073
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,889
Not this nigger again.

1074
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,957
Are you all ready to see
Young Jeezy?

1075
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,129
Yeah, before we bring out Jeezy,

1076
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,032
i'd like to say that this show
was brought to you

1077
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,634

1078
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:39,072

01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,972
and you know we bring

1080
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:44,477
- Fuck that!
- Hey, man, be nice.

1081
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,611
None of that bullshit, Modesto.

1082
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,414
Don't embarrass me up here, now.
Don't embarrass me.

1083
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,517
Before we bring out Young Jeezy,
i got a treat for you all.

1084
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:53,918
Y'all know who he is.

1085
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,856
Y'all done seen him since he
was yea high to a horsefly.

1086
01:00:56,954 --> 01:01:00,427
He better than Jay-Z,
he better than Little Wang

1087
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,693
and Kanye West put together.

1088
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:06,901
Y'all give it up for my son,
Yung Semore!

1089
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,934
Give it up! Give it up!

1090
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,575
Uh, let's go.

1091
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,179
Jeezy down in the building.

1092
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,282
What's happening, Modesto?

1093
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,451
I go by the name of Yung Semore.

1094
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,923
Make some noise for me. Yeah!

1095
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,455
We're gonna do it like this.

1096
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,466
How's everything going?

1097
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:44,035
How the fuck you think, man?

1098
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,971
Where you been?
Where the group?

1099
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,972
I went up to the hotel.
They wasn't there.

1100
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,706
Did you call?

1101
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:52,411
I called up there.
I ain't get no answer.

1102
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:55,047
Fuck it. Come on.

1103
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:12,501
Hey, Percy, man, our reputation
in Modesto is in jeopardy as of now.

1104
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,398
Okay, call me back, brother,
please.

1105
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,135
Please, brother, please.
Call me back, brother, please.

1106
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,803
Damn, why you didn't call me?

1107
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,172
Man, Regina's trifling ass
came over there

1108
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:25,112
and put it on me and had me
in the bed for about an hour.

1109
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,343
Shit.

1110
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,380
Okay, what time did you
get to the hotel?

1111
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,448
I got there about 9:OO, 9:30.

1112
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:32,550
Look, i already see
where you're trying to go.

1113
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:34,753
- It ain't my fault.
- It is your fault.

1114
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,022
I don't know how,
but l know it's your fault.

1115
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,025
- Don't start.
- Why you bring Mondo into--?

1116
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:43,930
Mondo wanted to invest
with Jellyroll Entertainment.

1117
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:46,264
- Mondo?
- You just mad 'cause i got investors

1118
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,500
and you ain't got none,
going on with all that.

1119
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,970
Twenty Gs, dog?
You don't need 20 Gs!

1120
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:56,111
Don't worry about the internal affairs
of Jellyroll Entertainment.

1121
01:02:56,206 --> 01:03:00,380
Like i said, all you need to worry
about is that Aruba money.

1122
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,879
Stay out of my goddamn business.

1123
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,750
Can i ask you just one thing,
FYI, okay, for your information,

1124
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,985
- or just for my information.
- Come on with it.

1125
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:10,457
How the hell you gonna get Jeezy
to show up at some after party

1126
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,123
if he won't even show up
to our show?

1127
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:14,292
You just stay out of my business.

1128
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,394
Just worry about that Aruba money.

1129
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:20,634
Your business is my business!
Remember that!

1130
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:30,077
Yeah, Yung Semore
in the building, baby.

1131
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,814
No passes?

1132
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:39,285
Dirty motherfuckers.

1133
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,122
Bitch, how much for 2T tickets?

1134
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,094
Don't do this, Percy.
We got the people out here.

1135
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,795
They waiting for Jeezy.
There ain't no Jeezy, man.

1136
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:53,498
Call me back, man.
I'd really appreciate it, man.

1137
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,101
It's Russell Redds.
Call me back, brother, please.

1138
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,937
Please, brother, please.
Thank you.

1139
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,242
I fucked up, huh?

1140
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,281
Yeah, you did.
That ain't business, man.

1141
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:10,981
You should've handled business.

1142
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:12,983
I know, i know.

1143
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,585
- That ain't business.
- I know.

1144
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,287
Damn, man.

1145
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:19,124
Oh, there they are.

1146
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,960
Hey, Jeezy, baby! Hot damn!

1147
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,496
Look, man, you scared
the hell out of us.

1148
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,464
Where you been?
Where Percy at?

1149
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,800
Had a little situation
with my road manager, man.

1150
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,534
Hey, man, fuck all that.

1151
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,970
You were supposed to be on stage
about an hour ago.

1152
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,205
You're very unprofessional.

1153
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:37,109
Unprofessional? I'm here now,
nigger.

1154
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,911
Gentlemen, we don't need that.
How much time you need?

1155
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,881
Ten minutes. Hey, but where
the rest of that paper at?

1156
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:46,485
Oh, now, look, man.
You secure now.

1157
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:50,324
We got your dough.
We ain't no small-time dudes.

1158
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,624
- Okay.
- We've been doing this a while.

1159
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,826
We got your money.
You secure on that.

1160
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:59,400
But i wanted to talk to Percy
because earlier, at sound check,

1161
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:03,237
he promised me and Jellyroll
that we probably could get

1162
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:06,505
a slight discount
if the house wasn't that full.

1163
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,974
Now, look, we got a 3500-seater.

1164
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,976
Now, it's only about 52T.

1165
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,612
Something like that,
ballpark figure.

1166
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:18,351
So i was just wondering
if that little discount still rang true.

1167
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:20,451
You saying that to say what?

1168
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,689
I'm saying that, you know,
you got all these platinum plaques.

1169
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:26,825
I thought you was bigger than that.
I thought you could fill the house.

1170
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,662
I am bigger than that. Maybe
y'all should be better promoters.

1171
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,197
And you're saying that to say what?

1172
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,499
I'm saying it to say
I want my fucking money.

1173
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,300
Let's roll, man.

1174
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,369
We got your money.
That ain't shit.

1175
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:40,104
Little old chump change.

1176
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:43,208
Man, you ain't got to be
all hostile like that.

1177
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,941
You have a nice show.

1178
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,944
Yeah, have a nice show, brother.

1179
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:50,116
You need to freeze some of that
meat on the back of your head.

1180
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,731
Get off the stage!

1181
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,237
SEMORE: Somebody say yeah.

1182
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,671
You see the look on that
motherfucker's face when i told him?

1183
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,007
"l thought you
was bigger than that."

1184
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,477
No, did you see
the look on your face

1185
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,714
when he said that you was
a sorry-ass promoter?

1186
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,915
You looked stupid
as a motherfucker.

1187
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,451
Just give me the money
so we can pay these clowns.

1188
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,990
I-i-i tried to tell you
when i pulled up, man.

1189
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:34,460
I tried to tell you
when i pulled up.

1190
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:37,329
Regina's husband tried
to run us over, man.

1191
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,297
What's that got to do
with the money?

1192
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:41,065
Look, i tried to offset it,

1193
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,668
'cause I thought we was gonna
have a walk-up crowd.

1194
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,705
You started yelling at me,
and then i messed up money.

1195
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:50,477
Come on through.
What that got to do with anything?

1196
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,278
What that got to do, man?
Look, look, look, don't tell me.

1197
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:57,116
Don't tell me. Jellyroll,
do you have this man's money?

1198
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,885
No, i don't have the money,
but...

1199
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,353
This watch.

1200
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:05,191
Oh, man! I don't give a goddamn
about that damn watch.

1201
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:07,124
Oh, Lord, no...

1202
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,428
Come on, man, the Lord ain't
got nothing to do with this.

1203
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,661
Jesus Christ.

1204
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,066
Oh, man, don't tell me you
gave up this man's money!

1205
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,268
You know i mess up money
all the time!

1206
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,501
That ain't business!

1207
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,270
I've got a sickness, man!

1208
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,040
That ain't business, man!
Goddamn!

1209
01:07:22,137 --> 01:07:24,343
Yo, what's popping?

1210
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:25,843
After party.

1211
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,113
Y'all ready for Young Jeezy?

1212
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:33,452
You're gonna see
Yung Semore right now.

1213
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,288
Yeah, what's up?

1214
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,558
Yeah, man, we need to
holla at Jeezy.

1215
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,260
Yo, it's the promoters.

1216
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:43,761
Let 'em in.

1217
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,631
I knew there had to be a mistake.

1218
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,900
- What's happening?
- Hold on, hold on.

1219
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,002
Yeah, right there.

1220
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:55,241
<i>You got to treat a nigger like he's
on The Price Is Rightt or something?</i>

1221
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:56,506
Damn, baby.

1222
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:57,941
We good?

1223
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,445
Picnic-tablecloth-shirt-wearing
motherfucker.

1224
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,680
- What's happening, baby?
- What's going on, man?

1225
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,148
Show time, baby!

1226
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,517
Modesto's finest, huh?
What's up with it?

1227
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:08,519
Oh, it's packed.
They ready for you, Jeezy.

1228
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:11,757
- Bunch of bitches out there?
- I got one just for you.

1229
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,924
- Okay, that's what's up.
- How much time you need?

1230
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,459
About five minutes.
He tightened me up.

1231
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,862
Okay, cool, just have
your people let me know.

1232
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,398
I'm gonna be right there
by the stage. I'll bring you on.

1233
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,603
That's cool, but let's take care
of this business. I got that paper.

1234
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,870
I want to put it up anyway,
so let's get that.

1235
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,273
We just need to get you
on that stage,

1236
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,806
'cause it's a union building.

1237
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,342
We get you on that stage,

1238
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,645
and i hit the box office
and check your receipts.

1239
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:36,448
Receipts? Who y'all think
y'all dealing with?

1240
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:39,217
Wait a minute, Jeezy,
don't insult us like that.

1241
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,785
We done already took a loss.

1242
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:43,087
BOTH: You can't be a boss
until you take a loss.

1243
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,388
Bottom line.

1244
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,991
That's on y'all.
That's your fault, not mine.

1245
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,059
Why you all let them in anyway,
man?

1246
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,528
Hold on, hold on!

1247
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,699
Let me talk to my man
for one second.

1248
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,233
You got mo seconds.
Go ahead, take your time.

1249
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,601
Okay, looky here.

1250
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,171
Nigger act like he ain't never
performed for free before.

1251
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,405
Ain't that a bitch!

1252
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,714
- Say what?
- The watch.

1253
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,048
- With the big face?
- Yeah!

1254
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,118
- Nigger, please!
- We got to pay him!

1255
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,821
I have my half of the money.
Where your half?

1256
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:19,023
It's in that motherfucking watch,
and we got to pay him.

1257
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,726
I knew you was gonna do that.
I knew you was gonna do this.

1258
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,596
You know how many numbers
i done got with this motherfucker?

1259
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:26,931
- Oh, i love you, baby.
- Give it up.

1260
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,899
Hey, come on. You done good.

1261
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,870
Hey, G, i think we got
your problem solved.

1262
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:34,205
We can pay you with that.

1263
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:37,408
What the fuck is that?

1264
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,109
What kind of watch is that?

1265
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,413
That's something special.
That's a Genev...

1266
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,982
Let me see.
Yeah. That's a Genitalia!

1267
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,215
Genitalia.

1268
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,585
A lot of rich white men,
they know about that.

1269
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,421
You probably don't know
about that.

1270
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,054
How much did you pay
for the watch, man?

1271
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:52,789
- I paid 13,OOO.
- Thirteen Gs.

1272
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,360
- You paid 13 what?
- Thirteen cold cash, baby.

1273
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:57,595
Did that nigger have a gun
when he sold you this shit?

1274
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,431
Man, you got robbed.

1275
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,699
You not about to rob me with that.
Where my paper at?

1276
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,537
Oh, l forgot--

1277
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,438
Hey, hold on!

1278
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,446
I wrote these myself!

1279
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:19,450
- Man, they throwing stuff.

1280
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,586
Get your ass back there.

1281
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:23,953
Now i'm back.

1282
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,393
We some small-time brothers

1283
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,896
trying to do something for the
little kids in the community.

1284
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,931
You don't know no damn kids.
Hold up.

1285
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,900
Hey, pack up the equipment.
We about to roll.

1286
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,133
No, no, no.

1287
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,972
C.W., K.K., man, get these
fake-ass promoters out of here.

1288
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,539
Jeezy, Jeezy, baby!

1289
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,875
Hold on, man!
Don't put your hands on me.

1290
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,043
- Don't put your hands--
- Get the fuck out.

1291
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:50,749
Keep yourself--!
You're a dead goddamn band.

1292
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,584
Some bullshit right there, man!

1293
01:10:52,682 --> 01:10:54,051
What's going on?

1294
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,120
It's all good, man.

1295
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:59,223
This motherfucking goddamn rapper,
he might not be performing.

1296
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,824
Why the hell not?

1297
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,227
If it ain't one thing, it's another.
Some bullshit, man.

1298
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,461
Custody case, some shit.

1299
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:07,399
What are we gonna do?
They're gonna tear down my theater!

1300
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:10,001
That's the reason
why we got insurance!

1301
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,203
Insurance? You know
what the deductible is?

1302
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,937
Keep your voice down.

1303
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,775
Jeezy, Jeezy, Jeezy.

1304
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:18,342
Hey, come on. Yo.

1305
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,412
Settle down.
Settle down, people.

1306
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:29,987

01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,794
Let's go to this after party,

1309
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:38,195

Get your fucking paws off me!

1311
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,604
Let's fuck this shit up!
That's for Modesto!

1312
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:49,776
Ain't no Jeezy? D-boys, fuck

01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:52,009
Get these motherfuckers!

01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,316
Move! Do it, big boy.

1315
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,563
Move this shit. Let's go!

1316
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,534
What you doing, man?

1317
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,877
Hey, man, what the hell's going on?

1318
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:30,182
There go Mondo.
There's Mondo! Go!

1319
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,251
Hey! No!

1320
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,900
There they go! Jellyroll!

1321
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,369
Oh, no! Goddamn it, move!

1322
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:55,575
Move! Move, goddamn it!
Come on!

1323
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,041
Let's kill 'em!

1324
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,909
I want my money!

1325
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:00,477
Move, motherfucker!
Move, bitch!

1326
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,881
Come on, man! Shit!

1327
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:05,949
Get in, man!

1328
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,250
Come on, move! Move!

1329
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,020
There they go!

1330
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,292
Goddamn!

1331
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,199
Fuck!

1332
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,639
Y'all didn't see shit.

1333
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,776
Back 'em up.

1334
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:54,331
Shit.

1335
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:02,842
Oh, God! Look at my car.

1336
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,676
- Yeah.
- Damn.

1337
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,445
Man, whoa, whoa, we did it tonight.

1338
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:08,679
I know it, man.

1339
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,683
I want to take full responsibility
for tonight, man.

1340
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,786
I fucked up. I should've paid
Jeezy his money, man.

1341
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,119
That's all there is to it.

1342
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,723
No, no, i'm glad you didn't
pay them niggers shit,

1343
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:21,225
'cause if you'd have paid them
and they went on,

1344
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,893
we'd have still took a loss, man.

1345
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:24,795
Shit, might as well
both take a loss.

1346
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:28,166
I'm just mad i spent my Aruba money
on some damn rap concert.

1347
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:31,336
Yeah, you did.
You fucked up on that for real.

1348
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:34,940
Yeah. I ain't the only one
fucked up.

1349
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,508
You fucked up bringing
Mondo into the picture.

1350
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,078
Motherfucker almost
decapitated me!

1351
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,881
You know me.
I mess up all the time.

1352
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,851
You need to worry about
Loli killing your ass

1353
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:47,785
about that wedding money.

1354
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,421
I got a perfect solution.

1355
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,990
I'm out of the game, Jellyroll.

1356
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,092
Don't try to talk me out of it.

1357
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,430
We're not doing this no more.
This shit don't work for us.

1358
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,599
No, no! How you
gonna stop promoting?

1359
01:15:01,696 --> 01:15:05,504
We Modesto's finest,
and you talking 'bout quitting?

1360
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:08,774
Don't nobody come to town
unless we bring them into town.

1361
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,373
- You feel me?
- I feel you.

1362
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,576
You're the best, man.
It's in your blood.

1363
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,477
- It is, man.
- Come on, come on, baby.

1364
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:18,016
It is in my blood,
'cause we be promoters, man.

1365
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:20,318
I'm back! Fuck it, i'm back.

1366
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,386
Ticket sales is
overrated any damn way.

1367
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,755
Fuck the ticket sales.
We who we are, baby.

1368
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:28,193
We get money, man.
We don't care none about that.

1369
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,592
Hello?

1370
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,296
<i>LOLI: Where you at?
I know the snow's over,</i>

1371
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:35,032
Oh, sure, I'm just shooting
the shit here with Jellyroll.

1372
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:36,266
How you doin', baby?

1373
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,772
<i>I'm at the after party.
Your coming? It's packed!</i>

1374
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,004
It's packed?

1375
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,275
<i>Yeah. Jeezy picked up
one of Mondo's flyers, and he's here.</i>

1376
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,811
<i>He allmost knocked me down
trying to get in.</i>

1377
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,411
<i>- Jeezy's there?
- Yeah!</i>

1378
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,779
<i>How long is it gonna take you?</i>

1379
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,715
'Bout 20 minutes.
I'll be right there.

1380
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:52,949
What's happening?

1381
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,052
Hey, the after party packed,
Jeezy there.

1382
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:57,890
We back in business, baby.
We back in it!

1383
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,803
Yeah!

1384
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,237
Yo, what up, 'Do!

1385
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:17,108
It's your boy, DJ Scream.

1386
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:20,645
Big shouts out to Mondo
and the D-boys.

1387
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:23,949
Right about now,
coming to the stage,

1388
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,985
he came here tonight for the
after party to represent for y'all,

1389
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:32,828
so I want y'all to give me
a warm yeah...

1390
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:40,034
to my motherfucking dog,
Young Jeezy!

1391
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:45,036
Yeah. What up, what up, what up!

1392
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,605
What up, Modesto?

1393
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:49,673
I didn't get a chance
to perform tonight

1394
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,174
'cause of some janky-ass promoter,

1395
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,744
but I mean, your city
has shown me so much love, man,

1396
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:55,445
so I'm gonna show y'all
some love too.

1397
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,614
- You got something for me?
- I got you, big dog.

1398
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,018
Let's get 'em, Mo. Hands up!

1399
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,653
You like how I invested
in this after party, huh?

1400
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,956
Yeah, I do.
You know what? Come here.

1401
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:08,527
I like how you invested in that watch,
so I might have to invest in that.

1402
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,929
Pay for my wedding,
you understand that?

1403
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,829
Come on, Loli.
Let's go, baby.

1404
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,138
Jellyroll!

1405
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:23,407
Just the man I wanted to see.

1406
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:24,840
What's happening, Mondo, baby?

1407
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:27,412
Thanks for getting Jeezy
to show up to my after party.

1408
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,012
Told you I knew the nigger, man.

1409
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:31,248
Looks like we are
better promoters, though.

1410
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:33,684
Wait, you saying that to say what?

1411
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:37,422
Your shit was empty,
and our shit is packed!

1412
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:38,654
Beginners' luck, baby.

1413
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:42,261
You gonna need a few more years in Devry
to be a better promoter than me.

1414
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:21,824
Let's go!
