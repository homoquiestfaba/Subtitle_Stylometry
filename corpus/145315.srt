1
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,758
My husband.

2
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,962
Thank you for last night.

3
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,109
Thank you for last night.

4
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,400
Thank you for last night.

5
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,729
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

6
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,769
Shit.

7
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:39,689
Today, these visually-impaired senior
citizens will fulfill a lifelong dream:

8
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,223
To swim with dolphins.

9
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,994
Hey, check this out.

10
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,367
- What is that?
- Careful.

11
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,733
That is four years of research.

12
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,638
A technological breakthrough
which might just save a life or two.

13
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,606
- What's it for?
- A device to prevent...

14
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,644
...the beaching of cetaceans.

15
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,715
- That's whales to you and me.
- Cetaceans, huh?

16
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,079
That's a pretty big word
for a man-whore.

17
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,314
I'm not a man-whore.

18
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,653
I'm a fish enthusiast.

19
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,794
I stopped man-whoring
when I met my wife.

20
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,261
My mom said your wife
got eaten on your honeymoon...

21
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,195
...because you tried
to feed the sharks.

22
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,995
You tell your mom I was
trying to feed the turtles.

23
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,434
Didn't realize there was
meat sauce on the lettuce.

24
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,973
Whatever. I bet that thing doesn't
even work, you stupid he-bitch.

25
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,667
- Come on, I got it.
- Hey, you little bastards.

26
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,073
Give that back! That's not a toy!

27
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,047
That's the one. That's your grandma.

28
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,050
Give me...! Come on! Give me...!

29
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,926
Something seems to be going wrong.
I'm not sure what's happening.

30
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,837
I gotcha! I got...!

31
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,946
Hey, everybody. I'm home.

32
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,752
Hi, Kate. I missed you today.

33
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,158
The prototype's almost working.

34
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,193
All it needs is a few
minor adjustments.

35
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,303
Wes Takahashi in Malibu, where
three blind swimmers are missing.

36
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,466
I hope that man rots in hell!

37
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,812
It was some weird guy.
He tried to touch my ball...

38
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,419
- Hello?
- Deucey, Deucey, Deucey.

39
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,285
It's your old buddy T.J. Here.

40
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,459
- T.J.?
- I'm in Amsterdam.

41
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,755
Man, you'd love it here. It's like
Disneyland for college students.

42
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,225
You wouldn't believe this.

43
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,391
Why don't you come and let your
friend T.J. Show you a good time.

44
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,661
- Oh, that's crazy. I can't.
- Look.

45
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,305
It ain't like you got something
better to do over there.

46
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,407
Amsterdam is so far away.

47
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,840
Police have just released a sketch
of a man wanted for questioning.

48
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:17,381
Witnesses report he is goofy-looking
and probably a virgin.

49
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,918
On the other hand,
far away could be good.

50
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,581
Is my wife gonna be okay in there?

51
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,124
- She'll be fine, sir.
- All right.

52
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,592
Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 10
from Helsinki is now arriving...

53
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,561
Excuse me.
I think there's been a mix-up.

54
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,465
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

55
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,731
That's okay. I always wondered
what it felt like to be a white woman.

56
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,901
- Can I borrow it?
- Give me that.

57
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:45,900
Hold on.

58
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,042
All rows now boarding
for Amsterdam.

59
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,950
Excuse me.

60
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,485
Okay.

61
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,795
Hey, how many people
get to do this on their honeymoon?

62
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,403
You're sure it's safe
to feed the turtles?

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,303
You have nothing to worry about.
I'm a fish expert, remember?

64
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,612
What is that over there?

65
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,179
Oh, that's just some kid with a fin
on his back, trying to scare us.

66
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,409
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

67
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,920
Do you think the hotel would let us
swim if there were sharks?

68
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:36,119
Come on. This is Mexico.

69
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,322
They know what they're doing.

70
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,301
This shirt's gonna be
a great icebreaker.

71
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,414
Fuck you, American,
you imperialist bastard!

72
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,009
I love America.
I love President Bush.

73
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,711
Thank you for bringing
democracy to Iraq.

74
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,255
- Shut up!
- Oh, shit!

75
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,253
Oh, hello. Sir.

76
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,655
- Is this okay?
- You did miss a spot.

77
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,869
Did I get it?

78
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,567
Put some elbow in it.

79
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,205
Sorry, honey.

80
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,979
What's with all these red lights?

81
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,779
I wonder if they know
their curtains are open.

82
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,888
Oh, man.

83
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,427
Ahoy there!

84
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,992
Big Deucey in Amsterdam.

85
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,164
Man, get on over here.

86
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,566
Deucey.

87
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,472
- Look at this boat.
- Check this out.

88
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,042
You like that?

89
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,413
I couldn't be happier for you.

90
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,252
Come, let me
show you my float-crib.

91
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,587
- Okay.
- Looking like money.

92
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,323
I'm telling you, you gonna have
a good time, man, huh?

93
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,429
Well, it ain't much, but it's home.

94
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,402
It's nice.
I like what you've done with it.

95
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,908
Now, if you gotta use the bathroom,
lift up the toilet seat.

96
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,240
This is where I live.
This is my home.

97
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,076
I don't want nobody
pissing on my toilet seat.

98
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,517
What do you think of the float-crib?
You feeling it?

99
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,589
T.J., I think you got a bad leak here.

100
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,385
No, no, no. It's just high tide.

101
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,195
Is that what I think it is?

102
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,395
Yeah. I brought Kate.

103
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,267
I really wanna show her
a good time, you know?

104
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,495
Maybe buy her a wooden shoe.

105
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,663
Deucey.

106
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,072
Keeping that leg is kind of creepy.

107
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,313
- You gotta move on with your life.
- T.J.!

108
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,042
Hey, Lil' Kim, what's up?

109
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,154
I no more man-whore.
Too much danger.

110
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,449
Excuse us for a moment, Deucey.

111
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,260
Listen up, Lil' Kim.

112
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,593
When your little bony ass had SARS,
who got you out of quarantine?

113
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,967
- Go make me some money.
- No way!

114
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,162
I take my three inches elsewhere.

115
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,242
So I thought I'd come over here
and make a killing.

116
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,439
Got myself a houseboat, some ho's.

117
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,777
The only thing a woman love
more than a man-ho...

118
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,318
...is a floating man-ho.
- Makes sense.

119
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,614
Then all these man-whore
murders started.

120
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,982
My he-bitches got too scared
to go to work.

121
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,717
What kind of world do we live in...

122
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,522
...where the streets ain't safe
for male prostitutes?

123
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,695
Here's your hashish.

124
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,794
- Enjoy.
- Hashish?

125
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,800
- Yeah.
- No.

126
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,597
I thought this was a coffee shop.

127
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,299
Let me break it down for you.
You're in Amsterdam.

128
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,310
If you want coffee, you go to a café.

129
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,678
If you want marijuana, ganji or some
freaky-deaky, you go to a coffee shop.

130
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,580
That's where you is now.

131
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,358
Put that away. Cops. Cops!

132
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,166
Hold it right there.

133
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,669
Now, that joint looks loose.
If you want, I'll roll the next one.

134
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,474
Have a good evening, huh?

135
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,081
Oh, don't worry about it, Deucey.
This is Amsterdam.

136
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,480
It's perfectly legal over here.
You want a hit?

137
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,712
No. I'm not smoking nothing.

138
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,253
Oh, come on, man.

139
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,583
- Deucey don't smoke.
- Suit yourself.

140
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,250
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Heinz Hummer...

141
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,589
...the gigolo with the most below.

142
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,391
What do you want, T.J.? I'm busy.

143
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,965
I wanna introduce you to my friend,
Deuce Bigalow.

144
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,865
- He's a gigolo from America.
- Hi.

145
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,272
Sometimes you're really funny, T.J.

146
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,776
How much you getting
for a Filthy Ramirez these days?

147
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,174
I could get you more.

148
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,407
A Filthy Ramirez?
Where have you been?

149
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,244
Nobody pays for that shit anymore.

150
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,784
See you around, T.J.

151
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,477
The Man-whore Awards
are coming up.

152
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,088
You wanna win the Golden Boner?

153
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,884
I already won it twice.

154
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,788
Just ask your ex-fiancée.

155
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,724
Man, why you gotta bring up
Delisha like that?

156
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,892
I can't believe prostitutions
legal here.

157
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,730
Oh, yeah, it's big business.
They got a union, dental plan.

158
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,771
Man, if I had a he-bitch
like Heinz Hummer...

159
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,737
...put me back in the game.

160
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,976
- Is he that good?
- "Is he that good?"

161
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,704
They don't call him "Lord
of the Wangs' for nothing.

162
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,012
Man, what I wouldn't give...

163
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,744
For Heinz's wang?

164
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,216
No, I don't want Heinz's wang!
I want him as a client.

165
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,652
Hey, man, keep your voice down.

166
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,851
Talking about me wanting
Heinz's big juicy wang.

167
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,290
People would think I'm gay.

168
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,528
Now, a pimp's only got
one thing in this world:

169
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,223
His reputation.

170
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,234
Here you are, gentlemen.
Fresh today.

171
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,300
- What is this?
- Spacecake.

172
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,940
- Why do they call it that?
- You know...

173
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,409
...it's what the astronauts eat.
Like Tang.

174
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,513
I'm starving.

175
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,249
- It's a little dry.
- Keep eating. It gets better.

176
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,723
- You sure you don't want any?
- No.

177
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,920
Never been high, never gonna be.

178
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,260
This is pretty good cake, though.

179
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,430
Fucking excellent.

180
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,429
You.

181
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,237
Come on in here.

182
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,473
You...? You want me to...?

183
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,136
Yes, you.

184
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,264
- Maybe you can help me.
- Really?

185
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:01,372
I don't want a man who's
chiseled and sculpted.

186
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,772
I like soft and weak.

187
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,209
- You do?
- I want a man who's unemployed.

188
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,107
And went to a community college.

189
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,752
I am, and I did.

190
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,753
- You know what really turns me on?
- What?

191
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,619
Is thinking about him
in his tighty whities...

192
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,818
...sitting at his computer...

193
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,429
...and visiting different porn sites...

194
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:30,194
...and taking the free tour
with no intention of ever joining.

195
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,961
I don't have a credit card!

196
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,072
- Kiss my chest.
- Okay.

197
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,269
Harder!

198
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,839
- Bite me!
- You sure?

199
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,445
Harder! Bite me harder!

200
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,074
Get off of my titty,
you doped-up cracker!

201
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,090
No more spacecakes for you.

202
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:58,863
Hey. I'm sorry about that, T.J.
I must have gotten a contact buzz.

203
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,158
What'd I tell you about
making me look gay?

204
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,392
Not ten minutes go by
and you got your mouth...

205
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,161
...all over my breasteses.

206
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,668
My nipple's ruined!

207
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,131
You're lucky I was born with a spare.

208
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,945
There go one of my ho's.

209
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,180
The old guy in the walker's
one of your ho's?

210
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,977
Yeah. Why ain't his ancient ass
out there making me my money?

211
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,347
Kaiser! Get your old ass
back in the booth!

212
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,887
Deucey, meet me back
at the float-crib.

213
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,325
Bitches out here act like
they never seen a pimp before.

214
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:33,588
I raise my hand, they look at it like
it's a goddamn croissant. Then:

215
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,125
Feel my pimp hand.

216
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,866
Where's the boat?

217
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,548
Oh. You scared me.

218
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,983
Hey. Do you know who I am?

219
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,619
I am Heinz Hummer. I'm the gigolo
with the most below. Okay?

220
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,331
I can give you a Filthy Lopez
like you never had before.

221
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,262
I could give you
a Cambodian Creamsicle...

222
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,666
...that will make you
scream all night. Okay?

223
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,274
But not now because I'm busy.
So leave me alone, bitch.

224
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,272
Wait a second. Do I know you?

225
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,683
"New-jizz-fizz...

226
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,852
...ver-bur-ger-king..."?

227
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,796
Heinz.

228
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,714
Man, are you wasted.

229
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,343
I gotcha.

230
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,180
Coming up next, more weather.

231
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,427
What's this?

232
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,197
Hey, Heinz, wake up, check this out.

233
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,996
Holy shit.

234
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,736
Europe just got a little better.

235
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,166
Damn. That old Kaiser's got legs.

236
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,212
- You gotta keep your bitches in line.
- Yeah.

237
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,048
- What's he doing here?
- I found him passed out in the alley.

238
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,679
I couldn't just leave him there.

239
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,150
I put in a good word for you.

240
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,755
Thanks, Deucey. Much appreciated.

241
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,987
I knew you'd come around.

242
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,823
Oh, shit. Heinz ain't passed out.
Heinz is dead.

243
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,666
No. He can't be.

244
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,340
I'm telling you, Heinz is dead.
See for yourself.

245
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,075
Watch this.

246
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,978
Maybe he's just a heavy sleeper.

247
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,796
I can't believe you brought
a dead man-whore in my home.

248
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,762
- What were you thinking?
- I didn't know you could die from pot.

249
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,665
This is no pot-related fatality.
This is no ganja accident.

250
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,635
This man was murdered.

251
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,699
The Man-whore Killer did this?

252
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,374
- We gotta call the police.
- No, no, no! Hey, hey!

253
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,016
Goddamn, white boy.

254
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,481
You think the police gonna believe
a black pimp...

255
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,281
...had nothing to do with a dead
prosti-dude in his crib?

256
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,599
Before I toss your dumb ass
in the canal, I just wanna say...

257
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,964
...for the record,
under T.J.'s management...

258
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,073
...this would have never happened.

259
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,544
I just gotta see
what all the fuss was about.

260
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,643
Goddamn!

261
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,515
No wonder Delisha never came back.

262
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,486
That shit's the real
Loch Ness monster.

263
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,651
What's over there?

264
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,861
- Look where his hand is.
- What the shit is this?

265
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,595
What you looking at?
Turn off them damn cameras!

266
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,430
I ain't gay! I was only
looking down his pants...

267
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,904
...because I heard his schlong
was so big and juicy.

268
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,737
Wait a minute.
That didn't sound right.

269
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,880
- Perv!
- Give me them damn cameras.

270
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,911
Where is he?

271
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:49,520
We now interrupt Naked Seinfeld
for this special report.

272
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,280
The suspected Man-whore Killer...

273
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,583
...has been spotted
on the Prinsengracht Canal...

274
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,852
...attempting to dispose
of his latest victim.

275
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,963
- I ain't gay!
- The suspected killer...

276
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,589
...has been identified as
Tiberius Jefferson Hicks.

277
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,736
- You idiot.
- He is still at large...

278
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,370
...and extremely...
- Hold it!

279
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,130
Hey. Hey, guys! How's it going?

280
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,134
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

281
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,206
- Where is he?
- I swear I don't know.

282
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,907
Your loyalty is impressive, sir.

283
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,784
You've once been arrested for
man-whoring, were you not?

284
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,981
Look, I wasn't really man-whoring...

285
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:30,185
Please, Mr. Bigalow.
I've heard this a thousand times.

286
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,626
You were cold, you were frightened.

287
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,096
He took you under his arm
and fed you.

288
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,064
He made you feel sexy.

289
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,501
He told you how to hide money
in every orifice.

290
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,335
But your friend is obviously a killer.

291
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,806
T.J.'s not a killer.

292
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,643
If he isn't a murderer...

293
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,783
...then what was he doing
checking out a dead mars penis?

294
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,782
I guess he was curious.

295
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,451
He heard it was big and juicy...

296
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,922
...and wanted to see for himself.

297
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,458
A lot of guys do that.

298
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,196
No, they don't.

299
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,061
Okay.

300
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,134
T.J.'s gay.

301
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,440
- Really?
- Not normal-gay, but, you know...

302
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,503
...crazy-gay, you know?

303
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,773
Musical-theater-gay.

304
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,352
Is that why he puts lipstick...

305
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,482
...on all his victims?

306
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,291
Wait a minute.

307
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,088
In the alley, I heard
someone whistling.

308
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,862
And I saw someone.

309
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,029
A woman...

310
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,838
...in a leopard coat.

311
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,471
People see a lot of crazy things
when they're high on spacecake.

312
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,736
There's drugs in spacecake?

313
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:58,906
Mr. Bigalow, I will find your pimp
whether you help me or not.

314
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,890
- T.J., thank God you're here.
- How'd you find me?

315
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,426
It's the only chicken
and waffle place in Holland.

316
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,496
So a black mars gotta be
at a chicken and waffles place?

317
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,064
That's racist.

318
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,101
- But you are here.
- Yeah, but figuring it out is racist.

319
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,073
- It's a nice place.
- Did you know Holland invented...

320
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,335
...chicken and waffles?
- Really?

321
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,446
Before that, you could only
get chicken or waffles.

322
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,549
But they were the first
to put them together.

323
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,614
Black people all over the world will be
forever grateful to the Dutch for that.

324
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,018
You do know the Dutch
started the slave trade.

325
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,788
Those motherfuckers!

326
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,700
Who let them print this?

327
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,860
Look, we're gonna prove
that you didn't kill anyone.

328
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,304
I don't give a damn about that.
It's the "extremely gay" part.

329
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,172
If I'm a murderer, they'll welcome
me home with open arms.

330
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,176
Get out of jail and
become a huge rapper.

331
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,837
But a gay pimp?

332
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,041
- Like, where I'm going? Vermont?
- Look, T. J...

333
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,210
...I think I saw the real killer.

334
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,616
It was a woman.

335
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,617
Some she-john went
on a he-bitch killing spree...

336
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,090
...because she wasn't satisfied
with a Filthy Lopez.

337
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,957
- What's a Filthy Lopez?
- Forty bucks. Same as downtown.

338
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,191
All we do is find the she-johns that
went out with the dead gigolos.

339
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,164
- One of them is our killer.
- Makes sense.

340
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,668
- You gotta get back on the horse.
- Horse? What horse?

341
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,066
The man-whore horse.

342
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,867
We gonna use your
white ass as bait.

343
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,736
Bait? Look, I'm not man-whoring.

344
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,275
We'll find the killer
using your twat-sicle.

345
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,137
Twat-sicle? Gross! No.

346
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,950
Give this to my mama.

347
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,653
Tell her I'm sorry I was
a disappointment to her.

348
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,418
Sorry I called her friends
in the middle of the night...

349
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,527
...when I was pleasuring myself.

350
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,755
And tell her she don't have to worry
anymore about her baby.

351
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:00,697
Even if I wanted to, how are we gonna
find a dead gigolo's customers?

352
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,067
We'll go to the man-whore union.
But be careful.

353
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,469
They'll be looking for me.

354
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,876
Meeting of the Royal Order
of European Man-whores...

355
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,347
...is now in session.

356
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,180
These are the highest paid
he-bitches in Europe.

357
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,183
That? That's Rodrigo.
He's from Spain.

358
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,689
He can tie shoelaces
with his tongue.

359
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,786
That? That's Enzo. He's Italian.

360
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,261
His nutsack is insured
for a million dollars.

361
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,832
- That's 500 grand each.
- Check it out.

362
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,031
That's Assapopulus from Greece.

363
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,139
He can actually kiss you
with his butthole.

364
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,831
I'd like to never see that.

365
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:41,168
I'd like to say a few words about
our fallen comrade, Heinz Hummer.

366
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,677
Who's the blond guy?

367
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,079
Chadsworth Buckingham.
Comes from a long line of ho's.

368
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,185
His great-great-great grandmother
gave Henry VIII crabs.

369
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,356
But I know Heinz would like to be
remembered for most...

370
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,085
...was being a male prostitute.
- Hear, hear.

371
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,128
He was also a supercilious cunt.

372
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,561
- Who's that guy?
- Gian-Carlo. Silverback he-bitch.

373
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,703
Heinz Hummer was
undercutting all of us.

374
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,499
- What?
- Yes.

375
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,506
He was charging the same price
for straight sex...

376
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,008
...as he was for a
Turkish Snow Cone.

377
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,204
- What?
- Oh, yes.

378
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:20,578
He was also charging the same price
for a Belgian Steamer...

379
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,948
...as he was for
a Portuguese Breakfast.

380
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,725
As we sow, so shall we reap.

381
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,021
Thank you, Gian-Carlo,
for those kind words.

382
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,256
Until this insane killer
is apprehended...

383
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,765
...the union is going to institute
a new security measure.

384
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,599
This ring locks snugly
over your va-guy-na...

385
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,770
...and then communicates directly
with a global satellite system.

386
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,971
There are rings of all sizes available,
smaller for our Asian members.

387
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,082
Y'all know me.

388
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,949
My name is McManus.

389
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:00,050
I joined this union some
20-odd years ago for two reasons:

390
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,921
To have intercourse
in exchange for cash...

391
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,086
...and two, to protect me rights
as a man-whore.

392
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,458
But...

393
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,129
...three years ago...

394
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,567
...when this union
told we man-whores...

395
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,937
...that we were to stop having
intercourse with underage girls...

396
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,476
...I strongly disagreed.

397
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,580
But I did not stand up.

398
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,078
I'm ashamed to say I stood down!

399
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,816
And then three months later...

400
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,321
...this union told we man-whores...

401
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:38,929
...that we were to begin washing our
private areas between customers.

402
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,564
Our private areas.

403
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,359
And once again, I'm ashamed
to report to you gentlemen...

404
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,302
...I stood down!

405
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,271
But now, sir, for what am I
to tell my 8-year-old boy...

406
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,844
...when he comes to me
and he says:

407
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,949
"Daddy. Daddy.

408
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:04,349
What's that thing hanging off
of your he-pussy?"

409
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,990
How am I to tell him, sir?

410
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,159
Deucey, you can do this.

411
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,029
Due to high demand...

412
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,296
...each member will be
only allowed two tickets...

413
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,499
...to this year's Man-whore Awards.
- How's it going?

414
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,375
I'm Deuce Bigalow.
I'm a gigolo from America.

415
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,945
My friend Tiberius Jefferson
is not the Man-whore Killer.

416
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,449
Homo!

417
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,853
Now, I'm convinced
that the real killer...

418
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,319
...is a she-john.

419
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,593
Which means any one
of you could be next.

420
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,597
Now, there are a couple hundred
gigolos in this room.

421
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,236
Now, if we all work together...

422
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,429
...we can find out
who the real killer is.

423
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,935
What do you say?

424
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,749
How come you didn't
tell them I wasn't gay?

425
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,910
Did you not just see me
get thrown through a window?

426
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,246
- What do we do now?
- T.J. Has an old friend...

427
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,383
...who just might be able to help us.
Come on. Watch your step.

428
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,125
Right this way, please.

429
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,927
Deuce.

430
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,934
Antoine?

431
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,463
- Sit down.
- It's good to see you.

432
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,902
It's been a long time.

433
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,314
This is the list from
the man-whore union.

434
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,779
It's got all the clients that went out
with the dead gigolos.

435
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,285
Awesome!

436
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,994
Please be quiet. I went through
a great deal of trouble to get this.

437
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,992
- Sorry.
- Now, if you want to compete...

438
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,929
...with the European man-whores...

439
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,435
...you need to learn how to really
please a woman.

440
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,297
- I should write some of this down.
- Go ahead.

441
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,306
You must be able
to pleasure a woman with...

442
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,908
With your...

443
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,113
Pleasure her with...?

444
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,453
Do you want me to try?

445
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,927
All right.

446
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,925
Women really like that?

447
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,680
Man-whore down.

448
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,717
Get the list. It's in his pants.

449
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,119
All right. I think I got it.

450
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,757
Can't a brother stick his hand
down another mars pants...

451
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,163
...without setting off
the faggot alarm?

452
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,864
Marlene Alsmere.
She went out with Diego and Heinz.

453
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,905
What am I gonna do
if she tries to kill me?

454
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,805
Distract her with your magic she-nis,
I'll look for evidence.

455
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,878
The lipstick and the leopard coat.

456
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,922
All right. Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow.
Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow.

457
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,183
Hi, I'm Deuce... Biggest lady
I've ever seen.

458
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,420
That's a huge bitch.

459
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,523
Hi.

460
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,094
Cute kids. Are they yours?

461
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:45,572
Those pictures, they come with the
frames. I'm unable to have children.

462
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,705
I'm so sorry. That must be
very hard for you.

463
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,023
Evidence.

464
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,693
That big ho got food everywhere.

465
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,788
You're a nice man.

466
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,162
Now, take off your clothes.

467
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,464
Don't you wanna talk a little more?
You seem very interesting.

468
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,366
Take them off!

469
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,871
"Dutch Bride."

470
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,726
Baby walk to Mommy.

471
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,696
Come, come.

472
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,239
No! Like baby!

473
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,401
Baby walk to Mommy.

474
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,649
Good baby.

475
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,151
Come to Mommy.

476
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,428
Baby hungry? Want booby?

477
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,469
Baby never eat again.

478
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,784
You like them big hairy balls,
don't you?

479
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,493
Bad pussy! Bad pussy!

480
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,872
Hold it!

481
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,068
Hold it right there.
Is this truck full of marijuana?

482
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,840
Is this truck full of marijuana?
Can't you read the sign?

483
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,917
No unloading pot in the red zone.

484
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,777
Write him up.

485
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,582
- But, sir, it's my daughter's birthday.
- Inspector.

486
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,749
She's turning 13.
We need all this pot for the party.

487
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:19,192
Inspector. I got these lipsticks
from Marlene Alsmere.

488
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,559
She was a customer of Heinz.
She's big and strong.

489
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,702
- She could easily be the killer.
- The lipstick the killer uses...

490
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,097
...is a very rare one.

491
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:32,231
Shimmer Lavender Love number 66.
Discontinued in 1984.

492
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,502
But... But...

493
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,512
Sir, I have a list of the women who
went out with the murdered gigolos.

494
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,049
- Will you stop doing that?
- Will you stop playing these games...

495
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,847
...and tell me where T.J.'s hiding?
- T.J.'s innocent.

496
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,422
Oh, don't make me laugh.
"T.J.'s innocent."

497
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,321
Uncle! You forgot your lunch.

498
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,929
That's very nice. Thanks.

499
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,897
- Let me... Let me help you with that.
- Thank you.

500
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,272
Excuse me for asking...

501
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,537
...but why did you
slap yourself like that?

502
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,709
Promise you won't laugh?

503
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,544
I promise.

504
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,083
I have obsessive
compulsive disorder.

505
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,685
I have these little rituals
that I can't help doing.

506
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:27,422
I can't touch doorknobs,
I snap my fingers when I see a bus.

507
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,260
And when someone sneezes,
I slap myself three times.

508
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,801
I've heard of that. That's not so bad.

509
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,668
I'm sorry. Bells make me do that.

510
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,967
It got me kicked out of school.

511
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,942
It's okay. Everyone's got
a few weird habits.

512
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,572
Actually, I've got about 130.

513
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,276
So you're above average.

514
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,118
I mean...
I'm Deuce.

515
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,649
I'm Eva.

516
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,318
Is that a Sudanese Sweetlips?

517
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,693
- How did you know?
- It's, like, my top-five favorite fish.

518
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,598
They have one
here at the aquarium.

519
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,664
I heard this place is incredible.

520
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,473
The doorknob?

521
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,779
I'll get it. Okay.

522
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,150
Thanks. Thank you.

523
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,283
He's beautiful.

524
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,713
That's really good.

525
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,816
Thank you.

526
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:43,871
Excuse me, but in America they don't
allow smoking in aquariums.

527
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,606
Well, in Europe, we don't unilaterally
attack a country just to steal their oil.

528
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,082
What?

529
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,243
"What?" Did I offend you?
Are you going to shock and awe me?

530
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:00,182
Maybe you should check my pockets
for weapons of mass destruction!

531
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,826
What? I just asked you
to put your cigarette out.

532
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,291
And then what is next?

533
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,487
Take wine away from my children?

534
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,790
I put out this cigarette.
God bless America.

535
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,837
The nicotine in that cigarette
is poisonous.

536
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,737
- So they say.
- It could kill every fish in that tank.

537
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,605
Poor little fishy.

538
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,407
Hey. Why are you with that loser?

539
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,857
You have a nice ass.

540
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,090
I think this belongs to you.

541
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,875
You dick!

542
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,870
I would like to take you from behind.

543
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,385
My penis is uncircumcised.

544
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,883
No head.

545
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,081
It's like a torpedo.

546
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,793
- You pig.
- Oh, are you tired of swimming?

547
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,421
Did the little fishies
not want to play with you?

548
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,169
Fuck off, you Yank!

549
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,682
I'm staying with
my uncle for the summer.

550
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,819
Then I go back
to art school in Brussels.

551
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,654
Could I take you out
for coffee sometime?

552
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,256
You mean like a date?

553
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,415
Well, yeah.

554
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,592
Oh, the siren.

555
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,796
Right. Right. Siren.

556
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,771
Before I can go on a date I have to
collect five different colored tulips...

557
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,708
...eat two herring and drink a beer
from a wooden shoe.

558
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,237
Well, that sounds doable.

559
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,645
What is it?

560
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,887
The accordion player?

561
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,601
The Smelly Finger Dance.

562
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,878
One cheek at a time.

563
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,239
Hey, guys. I need a quick gigolo fix.
What do you say?

564
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,884
I'm judging a sandcastle-building
competition this afternoon...

565
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,751
...so I can't help you.

566
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,324
The dog ate my penis.

567
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,696
You don't have to walk me
any further. I just work over there.

568
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,597
- I don't mind.
- I'm kind of embarrassed of my job.

569
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,001
I'm kind of embarrassed of my job too.
What do you do?

570
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,533
Bye, Deuce.

571
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:10,805
Well, well, well. If it isn't
Deuce Not-So-Big-Below.

572
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,442
It's Bigalow.

573
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,849
What's your going rate, Douche?

574
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,116
Well, I was getting $ 10.

575
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:27,527
Okay, gigolo. Do you even know
when a woman is having an orgasm?

576
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,757
Sure I know. It's when she says:

577
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:34,030
"Please stop. It's okay. You tried.

578
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,035
Now, get off me."

579
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,908
I bet he doesn't even know
how to give a Sneaky Castro.

580
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:48,313
Well, that depends. If she wants it
regular sneaky or extra sneaky.

581
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,284
There is no such thing
as an Extra Sneaky Castro.

582
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,650
Is there?

583
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,288
It's when you stick it in their...

584
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,761
It's pretty convenient, your friend
killing off all the competition.

585
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,226
I've got my eye on you, Small-Below.

586
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,394
Small-Below.

587
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,944
I'll be right down.

588
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,978
Okay.

589
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,411
This is the woman
that went out with Heinz...

590
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,613
...the night before
he was murdered.

591
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:33,228
Don't worry about it, Sherlock Ho.
I ain't gonna let you out of my sight.

592
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,302
Hi, you must be Lily. I'm Deuce.

593
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,700
Nice to meet you.

594
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,281
Would you like some bread?

595
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,477
Oh, I can't have bread.

596
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,350
It's makes my
esophageal lining swell up...

597
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,991
...and could block my throat-hole.

598
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,995
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

599
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,869
Pardon me. I had to clear.

600
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,396
Yeah.

601
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,075
- So, what do you do?
- I just got fired.

602
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:23,145
- I'm sorry.
- I was a phone-sex operator.

603
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,010
I only lasted a week.
They were jealous of me.

604
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,055
I heard that Heinz Hummer
had a bit of a jealous streak.

605
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,953
I bet you're glad he's dead.

606
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:39,994
Heinz was the most
gentle man I ever knew.

607
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,032
I miss him and his mangina.

608
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,995
I can't take it anymore.

609
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,741
I'm sorry. I can see that
you really liked Heinz.

610
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,339
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thanks.

611
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,956
- Let's go.
- I think I'm gonna puke.

612
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,287
I started smoking again
when I lost my job.

613
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:14,090
If I don't find another one pretty soon,
I'm gonna lose my house.

614
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,893
Well, we'll just have to find
you a new one.

615
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,302
- Relax. Have some wine.
- Thanks.

616
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,976
I don't normally drink red wine so...

617
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,912
I have hiccups.

618
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,055
- Gone down the wrong hole, I think.
- Check, please.

619
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,066
Deuce, I can't thank you enough.

620
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,796
It's good for you, it's good for them.
I'm just glad it worked out.

621
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,465
- I better get to work.
- I'll be hearing from you.

622
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,134
Okay.

623
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,784
The white zone is for loading
and unloading of vehicles only.

624
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,387
There is no parking
in the white zone.

625
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,524
Thanks, Deuce. I had fun last night.

626
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:15,920
The white zone...

627
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,788
I am Rodrigo Bollas de Madera.

628
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:25,061
I am here for my 12:30
ass-hair bleaching.

629
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,135
Okay. How blond do you wanna go?

630
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,171
Gwyneth.

631
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,169
Good choice.

632
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,052
Oh, hey.

633
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:49,454
I got a real Janeane Garofalo
situation back there, so go for it.

634
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,859
So, Enzo...

635
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,469
...got any she-johns
lined up for tonight?

636
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,971
Well, I did a Chili Rainbow
last night so I'm exhausted.

637
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,406
What about you, Assapopulus?

638
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,910
I've got the herpes so...

639
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,638
What are you gonna do?

640
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,745
Liar!

641
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,751
- Mahmoud!
- What's your excuse?

642
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,049
I just realized I'm gay.

643
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,518
Any of you guys want a blowjob?

644
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,332
I do.

645
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,397
Well...

646
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:36,938
Okay, then. I better go
put that penis in my mouth.

647
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,405
You're all afraid
of the Man-whore Killer.

648
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,009
- No. Come on.
- No, we're not.

649
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,079
- Get down!
- I don't wanna die!

650
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,382
You really should find
a better hiding place.

651
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,077
Oh, you haven't heard.

652
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,947
- Rodrigo's been killed.
- No.

653
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,389
Oh, my God, why? He was just
having his ass hair bleached.

654
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,927
He got much more than that,
I can assure you.

655
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,402
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very happy that Scotland Yard...

656
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,631
...has now joined the search
for the gay killer, Tiberius Jefferson.

657
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,275
Thank you very much.

658
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,709
So how about this next one?
Svetlana Revenko.

659
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,615
The Russian women are
a little freaky down below.

660
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:23,219
Hair start in the front,
don't end till it get to the back.

661
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,446
So if you gotta give
a little mouth-to-south...

662
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,419
...put a clothespin on your nose.

663
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,559
I'll keep that in mind.

664
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,927
Wish me luck.

665
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:37,158
Gasov. You mind changing that
to the weather channel?

666
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,899
It's gonna be cold tomorrow.

667
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,676
I have been waiting for you,
Mr. Bigalow.

668
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,580
Aren't you afraid to work with the
Man-whore Killer on the loose?

669
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,146
What do you know about it?

670
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,653
Apparently there's some maniac
who's killing them all.

671
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,223
Some people say they deserve it.
What do you think?

672
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,657
I think everything
happens for reason.

673
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,157
You're probably wondering
why I'm wearing this veil.

674
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,369
I wasn’t, but if you
wanna talk about it, cool.

675
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,936
I grew up in Chernobyl.

676
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,333
Chernobyl.

677
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,673
- What a pretty name.
- My mother...

678
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:23,677
...she work in nuclear reactor
when she was pregnant with me.

679
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,845
Instead of a nose, I was born
with an appendage on my face.

680
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,679
A male appendage.

681
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,457
No shit?

682
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:41,658
I have always been a little
self-conscious about it.

683
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,198
Well, you shouldn't. I mean...

684
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:49,704
A lot of women would love
to have a guy's dick on their face.

685
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,000
Yours is just permanent.

686
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,805
You are sweet.

687
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,309
And very handsome
for an American.

688
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,210
I like you.

689
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,158
I would love to hear
some Latin music.

690
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,630
Well, I'll see if the penis knows any.

691
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,134
I mean the pianist.

692
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,830
The guy playing the piano.

693
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,172
The band has started.
Aren’t we lucky?

694
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,263
Damn, no lipstick.

695
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,528
- You smell nice. What is it?
- It's Old Nice.

696
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,971
It's a knockoff of Old Spice.

697
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,372
I like it, but I think
it makes me sneeze.

698
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,536
What happens when you sneeze?

699
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,044
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

700
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,580
Oh, good Lord.
Now is a good time to turn.

701
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,133
Hi.

702
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,244
How long are you going
to be staying in Holland?

703
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,611
Only until I can prove
my friend T.J.'s innocent.

704
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,145
Is there someone waiting
for you back home?

705
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,956
It's kind of hard to explain.

706
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,088
Would you like to meet her?

707
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,457
She's here in Amsterdam?

708
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,328
It's my wife.

709
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,794
I got her right here in my duffle bag.

710
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,939
Kate, this is my new friend, Eva.

711
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,974
She passed away
a couple of years ago...

712
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,344
...and this is all I have left
of her and I...

713
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,782
Nice to meet you.

714
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:27,124
She was very lucky to have
someone so devoted to her.

715
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,744
Hey, can I see you
when you get off work?

716
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,818
Oh, you know, I'd really love to,
but I'm going to be so tired.

717
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,887
- Bye.
- Okay.

718
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,425
Eva. Eva.

719
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,435
Did you just kiss me nine times
because you're OCD?

720
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:13,235
No. It's because I like you.

721
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,544
Excuse us, coming through.

722
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,218
What are they doing
in there, anyway?

723
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,616
They're making a movie.

724
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,188
Cool. What kind of movie?

725
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:35,064
- I better get to work.
- Okay.

726
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,857
In there? You work in there?

727
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,863
- Yeah. Well...
- Hi, Eva. Great work yesterday.

728
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,200
- Thank you.
- Eva. Eva. Listen...

729
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,832
...we really need you on the set.
All the guys are waiting.

730
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:51,310
- All the guys?
- Yeah. I can't keep them waiting.

731
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:52,709
Bye, Deuce.

732
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,277
I'll put your name on the list.

733
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,826
Hey, whoa, whoa.

734
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,801
Back of the line, buddy.

735
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,668
Trust me, she's worth the wait.

736
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,339
It's a closed set,
you can't come in.

737
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,913
Like hell I can't.

738
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,147
Get off her, you little freak!

739
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,323
Eva, you don't have to do this.

740
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,533
Hey, I agreed to one midget,
not two!

741
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:49,862
Deuce?

742
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,537
Eva, you don't have to do this.

743
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,204
Do what?

744
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,170
- This.
- What?

745
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,440
This.

746
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,686
You painted that?

747
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,515
I'm a scenic artist.

748
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,989
So that's what you do here.

749
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,222
Hey, little friend.
I guess I owe you a big...

750
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,833
Stoner Steve here! Who wants
to get high? Stoner Steve!

751
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,200
- T.J., is that you?
- Quiet, you dumb prosti-dude.

752
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,808
I've went out with every girl
on that list in Holland.

753
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,174
- Find the rest of those bitches.
- Those women live in other countries.

754
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:34,579
Goddamn, white boy! Pack up that
snatch-pole and go find the real killer!

755
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,413
Stoner Steve! Stoner Steve Café!

756
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,589
Hi.

757
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,093
Hi.

758
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,997
Hey, look at that.

759
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,793
Look at that, right there.

760
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,510
Are you sure?

761
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,441
T.J., there you are.

762
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,876
The girl with the giant ears
heard Heinz talking...

763
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,449
...about some photo in the man-whore
society. We gotta get in there.

764
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,917
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I'm in disguise.

765
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,046
I'm in blackface.

766
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,915
- But you're black.
- Yeah, but I'm disguised...

767
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,856
...as a different black guy.

768
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,020
- You look the same.
- What you trying to say?

769
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,392
- We all look alike?
- No, that's not it.

770
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,831
You're such a racist. I got half a mind
to stop helping you save me.

771
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,868
Come on. Jeez, let's go.

772
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:19,073
Excuse me. This is a private club.
Man-whores only.

773
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,184
Hey, I'm a real good man-whore.
Just go ask your mama.

774
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,983
Still. I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

775
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,853
That's what your mama said
after I bang her.

776
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,761
Okay, that's it.

777
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,363
Go, go, go!

778
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,001
Hey, your mama is in here.

779
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,970
It's okay. I know
what I'm talking about.

780
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:48,702
If you're going to stick two in there,
you're gonna need a lot of lubricant.

781
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,047
I know what I'm talking about, huh?

782
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,909
Okay, I gotta go now, Ma.

783
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,039
Hey, this thing is locked.

784
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:35,252
Man! I only heard about this place.

785
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,223
This is where
man-whoring all started.

786
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,161
Check it out. You know who this is?

787
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,732
He was the first guy
to keep from shooting his load...

788
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,129
...by thinking about sports.

789
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,938
This guy, here?
Baron Von Doggy Style.

790
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,633
Led a pimping expedition
to the Arctic Circle.

791
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,371
Froze to death
sixty-nining a moose.

792
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,607
The only thing left of him
is this stick...

793
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,912
...which he used
to bitch-slap Eskimos.

794
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:12,157
Now, this brother here,
Kunta Kuntlicker.

795
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,492
He's the Jackie Robinson
of ass-eating.

796
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,826
Vladmir Suckmeov.

797
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,031
The first man-ho in space.
They were studying...

798
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,538
...the effects of zero gravity
on the reach-around.

799
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,576
- Will you cut it out?
- I'm sorry. This is my Graceland.

800
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,606
Hey. Wait a minute.
Hey, check this out.

801
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,985
That's the blond lady with the
leopard coat. This must be the killer.

802
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,453
So, what are you going to wear
to the Man-whore Awards?

803
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,085
I thought I'd go with a tux and satin
chaps with my ass-plug cuff link...

804
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:52,626
- You left the trophy case open again.
- Whoa, papa, that wasn’t me.

805
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,292
Deucey.

806
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,833
- I gotta fart.
- You gotta what?

807
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,532
- I gotta fart.
- Well, hold it.

808
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,074
I hear something.

809
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,814
I think the building is squeaking.

810
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,714
Maybe it's a bird.

811
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,821
You idiot!

812
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:25,958
- Go.
- Bigalow!

813
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,337
Security! Stop them!

814
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,933
T.J.

815
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,956
- Move the curtain!
- What the hell?

816
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,716
Somebody smoked a he-bitch!

817
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,788
- Enzo? He kill Enzo.
- No, no, I didn't do it.

818
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,989
What is that?

819
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,559
That is not a dick in my hand.

820
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:04,764
Anybody got some antibacterial gel?
I got burnt dick on my hand.

821
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,649
Eva. Eva.

822
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:17,115
- I'm in the shower.
- T.J.'s been arrested.

823
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,653
I can't hear you!
I'll be out in a minute!

824
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:23,485
In his gayest murder yet, the
homosexual Man-whore Killer...

825
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,322
...murdered famed gigolo
Enzo Giarraputo.

826
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:31,163
Our meteorologist Truus is sick today.
Filling in is Henk van de Berg.

827
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:23,216
What's the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?

828
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,944
Like what?

829
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,699
I'll get that. I was a
Boy Scout for almost a week.

830
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,835
So is your uncle home?

831
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:46,398
No. We're completely alone.

832
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,305
Would you like some cheese?

833
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,844
I'm lactose intolerant.

834
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,482
Why are you so jumpy?

835
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,780
Maybe I can help you relax.

836
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,186
You're shaking.

837
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,316
Maybe it's because I'm cold.

838
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,455
I can fix that.

839
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,897
Why don't you pour us a drink.

840
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,498
So I guess we're all alone, huh?

841
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:21,709
Yes.

842
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,510
Deuce. You're scaring me.

843
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,477
Eva.

844
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:34,856
Listen, everything I'm about to do
is because I really care for you.

845
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,856
Oh, Deuce.

846
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,760
Now, I don't know why...

847
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,557
I don't know why you've done this, but
I'm gonna give you everything I've got.

848
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,593
Deuce?

849
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,104
- Don't go in there. Stop!
- Gaspar. Gaspar.

850
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,641
I know who the killer is.
I know who the killer is.

851
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,612
I know who the killer is.

852
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:39,880
I knew sooner or later
someone would figure it out.

853
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,493
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you.

854
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,893
It's Eva.

855
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,966
It's Eva?

856
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,935
You mean my niece Eva?

857
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,135
I know it sounds crazy...

858
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:06,281
...but I found the lipstick.
The same lipstick the killer used.

859
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:10,385
Shimmer Lavender Love number 66,
at your house.

860
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:14,455
And you found it in the pocket
of a trench coat hanging in the closet?

861
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,560
Exactly. Plus, I heard her whistling the
same song I heard the killer whistle.

862
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,093
Like:

863
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,830
Now, you tell me.
Why would anyone but the killer...

864
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:33,373
...be whistling that specific song?
The odds would be astronomical.

865
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,306
Maybe the song
got stuck in her head...

866
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,878
...because she overheard
the real killer whistling it.

867
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:40,072
And maybe the real killer
is someone...

868
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,678
...very near and dear to her,
though she doesn't realize.

869
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:50,024
Sure. Or maybe the Hamburglar did it
and escaped with the Great Pumpkin.

870
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:53,925
Look, I understand this must be
very difficult for you...

871
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,758
...to be out-thunk
by a civilian like myself.

872
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,924
But we have to put
our egos aside right now...

873
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,534
...and do what's best for Eva.

874
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,796
She's clearly ill
and she needs our help.

875
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,462
You're absolutely right.

876
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,973
You know, the only thing
I can't think of is motive.

877
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,374
I mean, what could she
have against man-whores?

878
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:15,074
Maybe because they represent
a decline of this once glorious city...

879
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,345
...which has become a new Sodom
and Gomorrah for rich college kids...

880
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,615
...to smoke hash, to fornicate
with Venezuelan hookers...

881
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:25,784
...or to defecate on our
historic cobblestone streets.

882
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,522
They don't defecate on the streets.

883
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,970
Well, how do you know he's a tourist?
I mean, he could be a local.

884
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:43,744
Where is Eva now?

885
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,744
She's at your house.

886
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,543
Good.

887
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,053
Do you really think you need
all those weapons?

888
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,320
She doesn't seem that dangerous.

889
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:04,330
- You're not gonna hurt her, are you?
- You can never be too careful.

890
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:10,070
- That poor guy.
- What a dipshit.

891
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:11,073
Tonight, the sexually-inadequate men
of Europe can breathe easy...

892
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,338
Tonight, the sexually-inadequate men
of Europe can breathe easy...

893
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:18,446
...safe in the knowledge that all
of the continent's finest gigolos...

894
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:21,947
...are right here under one roof,
all asking:

895
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:26,077
"Who is gonna walk away
with the Golden Boner?"

896
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,884
In this car, we have Assapopulus
and his date for the evening.

897
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,583
- Damn it.
- His mother.

898
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:35,663
She's the woman that made me
start into prostitution...

899
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,994
...made me go into prostitution.
I wanted to become a doctor, but...

900
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,033
Uncle, you home?

901
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:45,030
What a beautiful couple,
mother and man-whore.

902
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,309
"Man-Whore Awards"?

903
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,778
Please welcome your host for this
evening. Johnny Vaughan.

904
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:56,442
Thank you very much. Can I just say,
ladies, gentlemen, man-whores...

905
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:01,454
...a night where we celebrate guys
who can get wood no matter what.

906
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,489
Do you know,
they have gay-pride days.

907
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,957
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

908
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:12,031
- I'm going to kill them all.
- But why?

909
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:15,329
Don't you see what's happening
to our country?

910
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,341
But it's murder.

911
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:28,677
During the final number, when these
man-whores are gathered on-stage...

912
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,251
...I push this little button and:

913
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,615
Bye-bye, gigolos.

914
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:39,420
Shouldn't be that hard to pin the crime
on your good friend Deuce Bigalow.

915
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:40,823
I won't let you!

916
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,725
If you wanna stop me...

917
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,703
...it's as simple as touching
this doorknob.

918
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,505
- Where's Eva?
- Eva's gone to the Man-whore Awards.

919
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,174
- I'm going there too.
- I'm coming with you.

920
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:07,220
Yes. Yes, you should be there too.

921
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:21,704
Now let me give you all
the lowdown on T.J.

922
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,138
Now let me give you all
the lowdown on T.J.

923
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:29,505
In Thailand, I got a job in a carnival
sideshow, eating broken glass.

924
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:33,409
We did six shows a day.
That's a lot of broken glass.

925
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,915
And it's all collected in the lining
of my anus.

926
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:41,421
My ass is like one big,
nasty cheese grater.

927
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,428
Here to perform his signature move,
the Chili Rainbow...

928
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:51,089
...would you please welcome
Assapopulus Borealis.

929
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,357
Deuce!

930
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,186
Deuce! Right here!

931
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,624
- Hey, Eva's right behind us.
- Deuce, stop!

932
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,290
What are you doing?
She's right back there.

933
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:28,493
- He's the killer!
- What?

934
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,104
You're with the killer!

935
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,763
- I'm with the dealer?
- He's the Man-whore Killer!

936
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,773
Eighteen-wheeler?

937
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:37,009
My uncle is the killer!

938
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,748
Oh! I'm with the... You're the k...

939
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:44,374
She says that I am the killer,
you stupido.

940
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,357
But why? What did man-whores
ever do to you?

941
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,223
What did they do to me?

942
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:59,067
All my life I dreamed
of being one thing: A gigolo.

943
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,533
Yes, me. Gaspar Voorsboch.

944
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:06,339
I'll never forget that day. Never.

945
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,307
It was my first semester
at Man-whore University.

946
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,877
Now, today, class...

947
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:15,676
...we shall learn how to give a lady
a proper Portuguese Breakfast.

948
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,342
You take an egg and you crack it.

949
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,913
You mix them up.

950
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,025
Now, this is a good chance
to sweet-talk the client.

951
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,656
- And?
- And we pour that in there.

952
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,492
- Beautiful. Very nice, now. And...
- And don't forget the Canadian bacon.

953
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,327
Canadian bacon.
I was getting to that.

954
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,765
- What are you doing?
- It's a penis enlarger.

955
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,064
Just a few pumps
and it gets your thing bigger.

956
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,207
You mind if I give myself
a few pumps?

957
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,706
Go nuts.

958
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,037
There we go. So there you have it.

959
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:46,648
Tell me. How was your
Portuguese Breakfast?

960
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,305
Delicious.

961
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,748
- Elsa?
- Gaspar?

962
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,589
They knew she was my fiancée.

963
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,253
And tonight I will get my revenge.

964
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,763
Leave it!

965
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:25,211
I'm from Canada and I'm wasted!

966
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:28,751
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

967
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:30,915
- Are you okay?
- Stop! Stop!

968
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,720
Police business.

969
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,660
Come on, we gotta stop him.

970
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:38,433
Stop! Stop! Man-whore business.

971
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:41,263
Before we present the award for
Man-whore of the Year...

972
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:45,498
...let's take a moment to honor those
gigolos who have recently passed.

973
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,494
Hey, Daddy. I was looking in your
underwear drawer and I found...

974
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,290
...this bracelet.

975
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,359
Holy mother of God.
That's not a bracelet, boy.

976
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:17,335
That is a device that your daddy
has to wear on his he...

977
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,868
His he...

978
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,202
His he...

979
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,876
Happy birthday, son,
you got a bracelet.

980
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,309
Great.

981
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,311
Let's go. Come on.

982
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:31,316
Now the award you've all
been waiting for:

983
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,977
The Man-whore of the Year.

984
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:35,953
Listen. Go get help. I'll get
all the gigolos off the stage.

985
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,059
Okay. Good luck.

986
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:39,991
Excuse me.

987
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,722
You have to get off the stage
now or you'll all be killed!

988
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:45,662
Get the hell out of here, Douche,
before I have you thrown out.

989
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,462
- There's a bomb on the stage!
- You idiot.

990
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,400
You're all gonna die!

991
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,534
I'm the Man-whore Killer.
This is a bomb!

992
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,076
Everybody out!
Everybody get out!

993
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:58,975
You gotta get out of here!

994
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:07,245
You'll die with the rest
of them, Bigalow.

995
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:12,925
Those gigolos robbed me
of my manhood.

996
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:17,327
I was never able to satisfy a woman.
I'll see to it that they won't either.

997
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,772
You don't have to kill anyone, Gaspar.
Because you can please a woman.

998
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,408
Those gigolos don't know
what they're talking about.

999
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,547
Is he talking about us?

1000
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,448
Do you really think
all a woman wants...

1001
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,611
...is some guy to give her
a Mud Pretzel...

1002
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,986
...or Turkish Snow Cone
or an Irish Facial?

1003
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,058
- Yes, they do, liar.
- No, they don't.

1004
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:52,799
A woman wants a guy who'll ask her
about her day and really listen to her.

1005
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,936
- Or at least pretend to.
- Yes.

1006
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,838
What?

1007
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,734
When she's hurting...

1008
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,602
...ask her how she feels.

1009
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,141
- Cry with her.
- Yeah!

1010
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,213
These gigolos are just
ripping women off!

1011
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:11,252
I've never had any complaint
from any of those freaks!

1012
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,451
I faked it.

1013
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,951
A woman doesn't care
if you wear a Rolex watch...

1014
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,597
...or have a gigantic schlong
like Heinz Hummer.

1015
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,428
This guy knows his shit.

1016
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,495
What are you doing?

1017
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,840
Anyone else?

1018
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,740
If you let a woman know you care,
maybe she'll give you an Irish Facial.

1019
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,830
We will die together, man-whore.

1020
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,661
- You don't have to do this.
- They ruined my life.

1021
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:04,067
- Give me the detonator.
- No.

1022
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,002
My penis exploded.

1023
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:09,706
Okay, that's a tough one.
I'll give you that.

1024
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:15,543
But having a penis
is way overrated. Trust me.

1025
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,549
No. No.

1026
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,188
Gaspar!

1027
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,793
Are you okay?

1028
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,960
We did it.

1029
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:44,072
That's the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

1030
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,305
And I've seen some
pretty gross things.

1031
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:46,615
- In the car.
- Put your head down.

1032
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:47,912
- In the car.
- Put your head down.

1033
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,017
I'll be seeing you again, man-whore.

1034
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:54,984
Deuce, you saved
the Man-whore Society.

1035
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,521
The Golden Boner belongs to you.

1036
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:00,025
Thanks. I'm... That's very...

1037
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:03,091
This belongs to you too.

1038
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,565
Hang it to the left.

1039
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:08,694
You gonna eat that?

1040
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,237
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

1041
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,777
So I guess this means
you're a real gigolo now.

1042
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,675
I don't want you
to treat me differently.

1043
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,873
How much would you
charge me for a kiss?

1044
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,343
Well, the first one's always free.

1045
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:31,349
- Deuce!
- What?

1046
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,622
Oh, no. No, it's...

1047
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,422
It's just this.

1048
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,586
Deucey!

1049
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,313
Thank you, Jesus.

1050
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,782
Did anybody hurt you in there?

1051
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:08,260
Oh, you asking if I got ass-punked.
Is that what's happening right now?

1052
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:13,060
- Not if you don't wanna talk about it.
- Well, turns out I'm not that attractive.

1053
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,930
Well, you've been cleared
of murder...

1054
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,537
...but people still think you're gay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1055
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:19,833
Don't tell nobody I'm not gay.
Look at it:

1056
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:22,875
T.J., the gay mars pimp.

1057
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:25,843
I mean, I'm gonna corner the market.
Check out my new bitches.

1058
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,107
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, sweetie.

1059
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,807
Love you.

1060
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,349
Let's get chicken and waffles.
My treat.

1061
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:36,821
So the first thing a brother wants
out of prison is chicken and waffles?

1062
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,290
- Oh, come on.
- Get your she-cocks back to work.
