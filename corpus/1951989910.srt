1
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,796
we are going to see
more and more...

2
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,737
Of these visitors
from space.

3
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:22,333
And that before too long,

4
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,001
The evidence will be
incontroversial--

5
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:30,314
That you will have on your tv screens
and on your movie screens...

6
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:34,179
Concrete evidence that the ships are here
and that they are real...

7
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:38,254
And they're not fantastic things which
have been cooked up to make a movie.

8
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:48,984
we can say that
the recent sightings...

9
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,499
Are in no way connected with
any secret development...

10
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:55,659
By any agency
of the united states.

11
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:57,425
There's nothing
to hide at all.

12
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:26,514
The expression ''flying saucers''
is a catchall term...

13
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:29,354
For unusual lights
appearing in the sky.

14
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:32,792
we've been able
to explain them as hoaxes;

15
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:35,987
As erroneously identified
friendly aircraft;

16
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:40,299
As meteorological or
electronic phenomena;

17
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,902
Or as light aberrations.

18
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,521
None of the evidence
that l have examined...

19
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,927
would indicate
any proof at all...

20
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:22,430
That we are being visited
by extraterrestrials.

21
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,263
There is absolutely
no evidence.

22
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:28,497
we have not been
hiding anything.

23
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,486
Personally,
i'm convinced that...

24
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:03,855
There must be many, many
higher civilizations...

25
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,894
ln this enormous and incredibly
ancient universe of ours.

26
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,119
Doesn't feel like
30 years, does it?

27
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,423
Does to me.

28
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:44,392
we had some good times
under these skies.

29
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:46,896
Come on, mom.

30
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,272
Jan! Oh!

31
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:54,074
Are you gonna be here with--
we'll see each other later.

32
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:55,911
where have you been living?

33
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,477
oh, we're in
a small town in louisiana.

34
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:01,781
No, he's retired now.

35
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,353
hey, look,
they got us on television!

36
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:13,824
Turn that thing up,
will ya?

37
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:15,158
former military men
have gathered in roswell today...

38
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,325
For the 30th reunion
of the army's renowned 509.

39
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:22,165
- the 509! -dropping the a-bomb is not
all the 509 is famous for.

40
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,605
For more than six hours
in july of 1947,

41
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:30,009
The town of roswell was known
as the flying saucer capital of the world.

42
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,373
debris recovered from
a crash site in the desert...

43
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:37,541
was originally identified by army
intelligence officer majorjesse marcel...

44
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,582
As being from
a flying saucer.

45
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,448
But the party
didn't last too long,

46
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,580
Much to the embarrassment of the army
and in particular major marcel,

47
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:47,851
Shown here holding
what turned out to be...

48
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:51,085
A piece of aluminum foil
from a weather balloon.

49
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,960
l told you
this may happen.

50
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:01,433
l can handle it.we heard enough.
Turn that thing off.

51
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:14,805
Lewis?

52
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,473
Jesse. My god! l didn't know you'd
be here. l heard you weren't doing well.

53
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,916
Oh, yeah. Just a little something
about my chest.

54
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,587
l'm sorry.
well, you're here now.

55
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:30,123
what the hell else counts,
huh? how's, uh, vy? yeah.

56
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,851
Oh, she's fine. She's with me.
Yeah.

57
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,086
So is my son.
He drove us down.

58
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,251
He's a doctor now
in montana.

59
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:39,022
Not bad for an army brat.
No.

60
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,667
Lewis, could l talk to you
a little bit later?

61
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,103
Yeah. You're gonna be here
at the barbecue, right? no, l mean alone.

62
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:48,495
Let it go, jesse,

63
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,536
For your own sake.

64
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:57,910
welcome back to kjfl,
the voice of roswell.

65
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,345
General, you and i
were both here in 1947.

66
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:05,484
Oh, yeah. Let's talk a little bit
about U.F.O.S.

67
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:08,017
Now, the 509th ought to be remembered
for all the good things it did,

68
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,544
Not for one dumb,
stupid screwup.

69
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,022
Major marcel made a mistake.
Big deal. So what?

70
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,358
Shit happens.
Satisfied?

71
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:20,486
-jesse marcel.
-when it comes to U.F.O.S,

72
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:24,190
As far as i'm concerned,
it's a big bag of bullshit.

73
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:28,029
Out of the way! Here l come! The
man from outer space! End of story.

74
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:30,570
- take me to your leader, 509th!

75
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:36,741
Remember, you said you weren't gonna
get back into this.

76
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:40,100
Seems to me that
i never got out of it.

77
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,243
Oh, jesse, you promised.

78
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:45,641
Vy, l said i'd think about it.
That's all l said.

79
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:49,216
Dad, don't do this.
You made a deal.

80
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:52,078
Did i?

81
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,642
Hey, major, not gonna make too good
a night for flying, is it?

82
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:32,251
what are you talking about?
i love this kind of weather!

83
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,409
Little more wind,
i'll be airborne!

84
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:49,229
Hey, joe. Looks like a big one
coming up.

85
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:52,457
l wouldn't worry too much.
l got all the a-bombs battened down.

86
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:15,950
hi, dad.

87
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:19,042
what happened to the rabbit hut? l
brought them in so they wouldn't get all wet.

88
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:22,324
Uh-huh. why don't we put them in a box?
i did. They jumped out.

89
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,153
l mean a big box. we couldn't find
a big box.

90
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,655
Mm-hmm.

91
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:29,724
Sounds like something's come loose
up on the roof.

92
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:32,119
Yeah. what do you say we take a peek,
huh? yeah.

93
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:33,131
Come on.

94
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,903
Hey, dad, do soldiers fly
in weather like this?

95
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:43,394
- not if they don't have to.
- what if they have to?

96
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:46,631
- well, they try and fly around it.
- what if they can't?

97
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:50,232
well, if they can't, they just buckle up
and they fly straight through.

98
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:53,069
Really? wow.

99
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,277
jess?

100
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:57,075
Yeah.
l need a hand.

101
00:09:57,316 --> 00:10:02,378
Oh, hey. Let me get this.

102
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,692
Come on!
what the hell's wrong with you?

103
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,099
Come on!

104
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,104
what in the hell--

105
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,684
lntelligence. Marcel.

106
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,456
Uh, yeah, this is deputy pritchard
down at the sheriff's office.

107
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:01,729
Yes, deputy.
what can l do for you?

108
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,765
well, sir, the sheriff thinks
maybe you should come on down,

109
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:09,337
'cause, you see, this here local rancherjust
brought in a whole lot of--

110
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,767
l don't know
what you'd call it,

111
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,101
But he claims it all
came down at his place,

112
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,265
And the sheriff thinks it might be
something you guys sent up.

113
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,971
Something, you know,
top secret.

114
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,648
- like a missile. - uh, right.
Like, say, maybe a missile.

115
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,742
Go ahead.
Go on, tell him.

116
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,749
But if it ain't,

117
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:32,087
lt's a flying saucer.
That's telling him.

118
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,525
Sir.
Major.

119
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,790
You got a second, colonel?
what?

120
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,491
ln private?

121
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,795
Listen, the sheriff called. Says a rancher--

122
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,709
Gentlemen.

123
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,940
ls this, uh, sheriff
prone to drinking?

124
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,704
Not that l know of.

125
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:10,183
well, maybe it's, uh, some sort of...
Cowboy humor.

126
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:12,347
Could be.
l just figured...

127
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:15,319
You wanted to, uh, check it out, sir,
just in case.

128
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,616
Absolutely.
Better safe than sorry.

129
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,479
Yes, sir.

130
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:32,259
Sherman, it seems something odd
crashed nearby.

131
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:34,896
well, it couldn't have been
anything of ours.

132
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:36,799
l'd have heard about it
from the pentagon.

133
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:40,364
we know that, sherman. You're our
pipeline to knowledge.

134
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,175
Come with us.

135
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,377
You and marsha up
for some bridge this weekend?

136
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:51,381
well, l don't know.
l'll have to check on it.

137
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,043
lf you know what's good for you.

138
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,319
And now, frank joyce
with the local news.

139
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:01,318
well, it's been kind of an interesting day
here in roswell.

140
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,989
we have in our studio
mac brazel.

141
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:07,857
Mac, could you tell us exactly what
it is you found up there on your ranch.

142
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:10,930
Yeah, well,
i'd say most likely...

143
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,329
lt's something that come
from another planet.

144
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,695
Everything out there
was real strange,

145
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:19,428
Like from one of them
flyin' saucers.

146
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:21,665
well, we have been hearing
all last month...

147
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,763
About people seeing
strange things in the air.

148
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:28,005
But if you are right, we may have one
on the ground.

149
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,081
where'd you say
this stuff came down?

150
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,582
A ranch about 60 miles
west of here,

151
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,914
Run by a fellow
name of brazel.

152
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:49,920
Any ideas?
hey, how'd your interview go?

153
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,896
- went pretty good, l guess.
- you the fellow, that brought this in?

154
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:56,489
lt might not be a bad idea if y'all got
somebody out there to clean that mess up.

155
00:13:56,667 --> 00:14:00,033
'cause whatever in the hell that is,
it's scattered all up and down my place,

156
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,668
Any my damn sheep
won't cross through it.

157
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:03,635
when exactly
did you find this stuff?

158
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,867
About three days ago,
right after that last storm.

159
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,168
what made you
bring it in here?

160
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:09,842
well, a neighbor of mine
said that, uh,

161
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:14,741
lt might be part of one of them, you know,
flyin' saucers we've been hearin' about.

162
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,884
She said there's some newspaper
offerin' a $3,000 reward for a piece of it.

163
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:23,976
And to be honest with you,
i could use the money.

164
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,214
Hey, look at this.

165
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:33,718
whoa.

166
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:40,225
Yeah, l really like
that one.

167
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,403
- mind if we keep some of this stuff?
- l reckon not.

168
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:45,768
l can always get more.
You ought to see the damn place.

169
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,571
l'll meet you back at the base.
Yes, sir.

170
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,207
l gotta warn you,
it's quite a ways out there.

171
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,513
Turning out to be
a rather interesting day.

172
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:45,113
Now, where this thing landed
or crashed or whatever...

173
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:48,149
ls about ten miles south.

174
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:51,343
l reckon we'll stay here tonight.
Come on.

175
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:54,115
we're staying in here?

176
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:59,491
what? well, hell no!
That's the barn, man.

177
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:01,357
we're gonna stay
at the main house.

178
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,091
Come on.

179
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,095
This here's the biggest piece of it
i've found so far.

180
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,601
Hauled it out
with my truck.

181
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,781
it's as light as a feather.

182
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:02,866
Oh, my god.

183
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,573
This thing was big.

184
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:23,025
Anything?
uh-uh.

185
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,798
You know those japanese
balloon bombs?

186
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:34,031
Yeah.
Made of rice paper.

187
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,229
About 30 feet
in diameter.

188
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:39,698
They don't come apart when they land
unless the bomb goes off.

189
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:42,204
Then you'd see
char marks everywhere.

190
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,507
Right.

191
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,613
was this gouge
here before?

192
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:05,716
Nope.

193
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:08,390
All right.

194
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,162
Let's just suppose
los alamos or white sands...

195
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:17,555
Launched some ultra-experimental
plane, rocket or whatever.

196
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,096
They'd be out looking for it.
Maybe they are.

197
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:22,070
Maybe they can't find it.
That's happened.

198
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,971
Sherman, look around you.
what do you see?

199
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:26,902
l mean, what do you see
geographically?

200
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,199
This place may be remote
by car, but not by plane.

201
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,244
You'd have to be blind
not to spot this from the air.

202
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,675
Nobody's found anything
because nobody's out looking.

203
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,616
And that means
this ain't ours.

204
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:46,484
Mr. Brazel!
Yeah?

205
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:49,924
You may have just
earned yourself 3,000 bucks.

206
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,624
Huh!

207
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,598
hey. wake up.

208
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:51,931
Huh? hi.
what's up?

209
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:54,064
There's something downstairs
i wanna show you. Okay.

210
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:55,640
Okay.

211
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:12,848
All right? not even
to your closest friend.

212
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,753
ls it top secret?
well, not yet.

213
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:19,348
You mean you think it's gonna be?
yeah, l do.

214
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,256
Dad, you have my word.
Okay.

215
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:24,757
All right.

216
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:27,496
l want you to tell me
what you think this is.

217
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:32,932
Oh, jess.
lt's a mess.

218
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:35,628
Take a closer look.

219
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,739
where'd you get this?

220
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:46,544
Someone's ranch.

221
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:49,315
Hey, is it
from a crash?

222
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:51,652
How do you know about that?

223
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,813
we heard about it on the radio.
Everybody's talking about it.

224
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,682
Can l keep this piece?

225
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,918
- please, dad?
- sure. why not?

226
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,755
we got lots more of those.
Thanks.

227
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,188
Hey, take a look
at this one.

228
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,794
Looks like an ordinary piece
of tin foil, doesn't it? yeah.

229
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:15,995
well, if l scratch it--

230
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,369
watch this.

231
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:28,544
l fold...
And l fold...

232
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:31,945
And, just for good measure,
i fold again.

233
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,344
Abracadabra.

234
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:40,812
How'd it do that?

235
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:42,885
Beats me.

236
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:53,997
Hey. Hey, look. There's something
written in here. Look.

237
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,126
l think it's egyptian.

238
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:58,801
l don't think so.

239
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:02,229
Maybe it's chinese.
No.

240
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,436
No, it's not.

241
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:08,774
Son,

242
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:12,382
You may be the first person
in human history...

243
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:14,940
Ever to see writing
from another world.

244
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:46,765
Think it could be
russian?

245
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,935
Sure hope not.

246
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:53,575
Did you try a cutting torch?
didn't do a thing, sir.

247
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:01,274
Sir? l want this written up
as a press release.

248
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,785
Yes, sir.
Uh, excuse me, sir?

249
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:08,782
- is this ajoke?
- no, it's not.

250
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:15,491
''this flying object landed on a
ranch in roswell sometime last week.

251
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,766
''not having phone facilities, the
rancher stored the disk until such time...

252
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,165
''when he was able to contact
the sheriff's office,

253
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,791
''who in turn notified
majorjesse a. Marcel...

254
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,904
Of the 509th palm group
intelligence office.''

255
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,439
How come they never
even mentioned my name?

256
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:33,366
Maybe one of
the other papers will.

257
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,771
You know we're gettin'
calls from hong kong?

258
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:38,379
How the hell did they
find out about it so fast?

259
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,343
l think it went out
over radio as well.

260
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:43,773
The london times.
l'm not in.

261
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,451
Sheriff isn't in.
Cheerio.

262
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,247
Boys, what do you say we shut down
this phone answering business,

263
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:54,881
Get on out to that ranch, and have a look
at this damn thing for ourselves.

264
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:17,173
Ah, shit!

265
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:26,011
Hey, bob, here comes sheriff wilcox.
See if he can get us in.

266
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:30,309
- open the gate.
- no, sir.

267
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,388
what do you mean, no? i'm the sheriff
of this here county.

268
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,911
- i'll go where l damn well please!
- we have our orders.

269
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,581
- whose orders?
- colonel blanchard's, sir.

270
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,225
well, this is turning into
a regular circus.

271
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:43,461
Hey, sergeant.
Halt. Halt!

272
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,359
ldentification.
Are you kidding me?

273
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:49,060
Sorry, sir.
Everyone has to do it.

274
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:50,598
Colonel blanchard's orders.

275
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,477
where's that thing
goin'?

276
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:07,570
Hey, sheriff,
what do you think?

277
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,885
You know, l don't think
i ever told you this, jess,

278
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,013
But l almost got to drop
fat man on hiroshima.

279
00:25:15,522 --> 00:25:17,079
You did?
yeah.

280
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:20,085
lf old paul tibbets hadn't been
able to go i'd have been in.

281
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:25,394
l always thought that was my only shot
at the history books,

282
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,361
But, uh,
now l see it wasn't.

283
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:32,259
lnteresting how things come around,
sort of like fate.

284
00:25:32,402 --> 00:25:34,733
Yeah.

285
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:40,265
Yeah. l'll get it. General ramey
on the line, sir.

286
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:44,076
- should i-- - no, that's all right.
General.

287
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,238
- what the hell is wrong with you?
- pardon?

288
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:49,709
You know what i'm talking about.
what do you think this is, april fools' day?

289
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,275
what kind of a goddamn idiot
released this nonsense?

290
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,019
Sir, if l did something wrong,
i'm sorry.

291
00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:57,346
But--
you're sorry?

292
00:25:57,487 --> 00:26:01,480
Sir, as far as we can ascertain, not even
los alamos was testing anything like this.

293
00:26:01,657 --> 00:26:04,023
Major marcel and i
have been checking all morning.

294
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,055
Now, no disrespect
intended, sir,

295
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:09,594
But if you guys know something that
we don't, you should've told us!

296
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:12,364
All right, listen.
Do you think it's soviet?

297
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:15,261
No, we do not think
it's russian.

298
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:17,935
Have you-- sir--
excuse me, sir.

299
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:20,468
with all due respect,
i did inform washington.

300
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:23,634
l informed general mcmullen--
personally. Personally?

301
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:25,970
That is correct, sir.
when?

302
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,076
Yesterday, as soon as l saw the stuff.
ln fact,

303
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,441
At his specific request, sir,
i sent him some samples,

304
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:34,242
And they would've reached
washington by, uh, last night.

305
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:37,181
l wanna see the material
myself. Keep an eye on it.

306
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:40,949
Yes, sir. l'll send someone
right to you.

307
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:43,789
No, no, no.
There's no problem.

308
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:46,019
we've been bringing it
from the site all day.

309
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,682
And l wanna see
whoever saw this thing.

310
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,688
is that clear?
yes, sir, l understand.

311
00:26:58,932 --> 00:27:00,560
They wanna see you
in ft. worth.

312
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:04,469
- me?
- yeah.

313
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:25,478
Major marcel. Colonel dubose.
Colonel.

314
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:27,681
welcome to ft. worth.
General ramey's waiting.

315
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,013
Thank you.

316
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,422
l want these men
off this truck right now!

317
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:43,398
we gotta get these boxes unloaded,
and l mean right now. Let's move it!

318
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:45,500
l'd say it was
right about...

319
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:47,662
Here, sir.

320
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:51,665
There's an access road
that comes in from the east that, uh--

321
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:56,132
well, it's not on this map. lt's pretty bad.
l can't imagine it would be.

322
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:59,107
There's a windmill about a hundred
yards south of the large gouge...

323
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,043
where the object
must've hit.

324
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:04,980
There's debris scattered everywhere.
l've never seen anything like it.

325
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,142
Sir.
Major.

326
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,851
we have some reporters coming. we'll
show them the debris that the rancher found.

327
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,514
You will keep your mouth shut,
and l will field all questions.

328
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,558
ls that understood?
yes, sir.

329
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:19,926
Get the reporters.

330
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:24,857
l don't understand. what's this?
this is what you found.

331
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:28,160
No. Uh, sir,
this is, uh--

332
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:32,067
well, this is a weather balloon.
l mean-- yeah.

333
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:35,001
This is the, uh-- this is the part
that hangs down...

334
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,338
That reflects the radar.

335
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:39,001
l mean, this is ordinary foil.
This is tin foil.

336
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:41,413
we send these up every day.
That may be true, major,

337
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:43,175
But the fact is...

338
00:28:43,614 --> 00:28:45,640
This is what you found.

339
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,210
And from now on, you're not to talk
to anyone about this.

340
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:52,515
That includes your family.
Understood?

341
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,120
Yes, sir.

342
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:58,415
now, this is officer irving newton,
weather officer, ft. worth.

343
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:02,120
Now, tell us, what's your opinion?
it's a weather balloon.

344
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:05,018
l guess what made
this one here so confusing...

345
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:07,556
ls that it has
this radar target attached.

346
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:12,394
Quite frankly, i'm a bit surprised that
someone with major marcel's experience...

347
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:14,900
Didn't recognize it
for what it was.

348
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:18,304
major marcel, would you hold
this for the reporters, please?

349
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:26,178
lf you would kneel down, l think we
could get everything into the same picture.

350
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:28,578
Thank you.

351
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:44,660
This just in.

352
00:29:45,462 --> 00:29:48,896
what goes up must come down.
Bad news, folks.

353
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:52,464
Seems our flying saucer is more like
an empty teacup.

354
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,696
''according to general ramey, major marcel
should have realized...

355
00:29:56,803 --> 00:30:01,070
That what the rancher had found was, in fact,
nothing but a weather balloon.''

356
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:04,300
Talk about having confidence
in your army.

357
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:09,240
Here l was planning on inviting the martians
on this show so we could hear their side.

358
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:13,243
Sure saved me from a lot of
embarrassment, i'll tell you.

359
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:17,511
mom, what are they
talking about?

360
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:20,280
we held it in our hands.
You saw it too.

361
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:47,836
Hello?
hi, son.

362
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,136
Dad. where are you?
i can't tell you that.

363
00:30:51,446 --> 00:30:53,113
Just want you and mom
to know that i'm fine.

364
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:57,811
Okay. Um, dad says he's fine.
when will you be back?

365
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:00,481
l don't know. l might have to stay on
a day or two.

366
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:02,381
The cowboy cookout's
tomorrow night.

367
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:04,178
Hey, l know that.

368
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:06,950
And you better believe i'm gonna
try my darndest to be there, all right?

369
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:09,285
Dad, are you okay?

370
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,454
Yeah.

371
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,460
Put your mother on.
l love you, son.

372
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:19,225
-jess?
- hi, hon.

373
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:22,133
Hi.
Are you really okay?

374
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,465
Yeah.
Yeah, l really am.

375
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,537
okay, l love you.

376
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:32,274
Look, i, uh, gotta go.

377
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,502
l love you too.

378
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:36,339
Bye, hon.

379
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:52,854
Okay, general ramey, we understand
what happened at roswell...

380
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:55,552
was just some major's mistake, huh?
yes.

381
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:58,162
But now you're saying there are no
flying saucers at all?

382
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,798
well, as far as the military
is concerned, yes.

383
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:03,167
That is correct.
That is my information.

384
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,034
But people have reported seeing 'em all
over the country. How do you explain that?

385
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,365
well, when you actually examine this,
it turns out to be not quite true.

386
00:32:09,872 --> 00:32:14,241
See, they've been reported
in every state except one-- kansas.

387
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:18,171
Kansas is a dry state. They still have
prohibition.

388
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:21,106
l think that drinking may have had
a little something...

389
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,217
To do with this...
''phenomenon.''

390
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,099
Sherman?

391
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,709
Sherman?
uh, lewis?

392
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,738
would you mind leaving us
for a moment?

393
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:03,137
what do you have to say to me
you can't say in front of him?

394
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,716
well, i'd feel happier if he weren't here.
well, l wouldn't.

395
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,973
No, l think l will
step outside.

396
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:12,119
Thanks.

397
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:15,289
-what the hell's all this about?
- l wanna see your report.

398
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:18,549
what report? on what we saw
at the ranch.

399
00:33:18,726 --> 00:33:20,751
On what's been happening around here
since i've been gone.

400
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:24,454
'cause l saw planes coming into ft. worth
carrying boxes l know came from here.

401
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,860
And somehow, l don't think it's laundry
they're unloading.

402
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:30,167
So if i'm the fall guy on this,
i wanna know what i'm the fall guy for.

403
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:32,534
Then i'll be a good soldier.

404
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,960
Let me see
your report, sherman.

405
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:37,568
l don't know what
you're talking about.

406
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,336
The hell you don't.

407
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:42,534
Let me put it this way.
lf there were such a report,

408
00:33:42,744 --> 00:33:44,507
lt would almost certainly
be classified by now,

409
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:47,775
Andyouwould not be authorized to see it.
Sherman!

410
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:53,173
i can't do it.

411
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:56,950
l outrank you,
and this is an order!

412
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:59,146
lt doesn't matter
that you outrank me.

413
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:02,326
l'm not answerable to you
on this, jess.

414
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:05,425
l make my reports
to the pentagon directly.

415
00:34:05,828 --> 00:34:07,853
That is my mandate.

416
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:10,798
we won a war
by keeping our mouths shut.

417
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:14,199
lf you have a problem with that,
i suggest you take it up with washington.

418
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:11,011
l'm not allowed to talk
about it, and i'm sorry. But--

419
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:13,802
lf they say it's a weather balloon, son,
it's a weather balloon.

420
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,315
- but do you believe it?
- that's not the issue!

421
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:21,351
- but dad-- - honey, don't ask your father
any more questions.

422
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:30,551
Son, i'm gonna need
that piece back...

423
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:32,058
l gave to you.

424
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:35,765
They'd asked if l kept any pieces.
why?

425
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:39,720
l am not in a position to ask those sorts
of questions, all right?

426
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:45,527
l have been ordered not to discuss it,
and a soldier obeys orders.

427
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:51,873
That is the first thing you'll learn when
you go into the military.

428
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:56,268
l'm not going
to be a soldier.

429
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:04,747
where'd you put
the piece?

430
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,483
lt's in my room.

431
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,346
Come on.

432
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:19,999
# stare up to the stars #

433
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:27,678
# asking why is it real #

434
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,785
# all eyes #

435
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:34,843
# but this, l know #

436
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:39,548
# my love can grow #

437
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,352
#for still #

438
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,629
# i'm here #

439
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:54,734
Frank joyce. My god.
How are you?

440
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:01,063
So l heard wrong. So you haven't
given up. well--

441
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:05,343
Frankly, i'd have thought you knew
more about all of this than l ever did.

442
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:07,468
l probably do.

443
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,441
But there's a few things missing,
like what happened here at the base...

444
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,914
when l was off in ft. worth
is what i'd like to know.

445
00:38:13,984 --> 00:38:17,354
why? because l don't wanna go down
in the history books...

446
00:38:17,354 --> 00:38:21,484
As some damn jackass that
made a ridiculous mistake.

447
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:26,221
Hell, l know what a weather balloon
looks like. Everyone does.

448
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:33,931
Frank, i've been living
with this thing for so long,

449
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,035
Just building up
inside of me, you know.

450
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:39,135
Do you mind?
mmm.

451
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,998
And unfortunately,
in my case, anyway,

452
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:46,542
lf it doesn't come out soon,
it's not gonna come out at all.

453
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:51,936
maybe you shouldn't
have that.

454
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:53,977
lt's too late for me.

455
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:58,582
l'm thinking of telling
what l know.

456
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,812
Telling? who?

457
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:04,053
Newspapers.
Maybe you.

458
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:06,682
l don't know.
l'm not sure yet.

459
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,624
why don't we go outside?

460
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,502
Judd roberts,
he was my station manager.

461
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:26,332
He and i, we never really believed
that balloon story.

462
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:29,408
But, you know, you gotta be careful
with this stuff.

463
00:39:30,511 --> 00:39:31,943
Real careful.

464
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,843
''according to general ramey,

465
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:43,348
what may have confused them all was a
radar tracking device suspended underneath it.''

466
00:39:43,686 --> 00:39:46,348
well, so much for
the little green men.

467
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:48,546
And now,
it's back to music.

468
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:51,219
##

469
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:53,921
You don't believe it?

470
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,597
Frank, if it's
a weather balloon,

471
00:39:56,597 --> 00:40:00,534
Tell me how come brazel's ranch
was all cordoned off when we got there.

472
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,996
And if it was
a weather balloon,

473
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,202
How could marcel not recognize it when
the damn things are sent up...

474
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,030
By the 509 twice a day from that rooftop
across the street?

475
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:15,112
l mean, you just look up.
There they are.

476
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,646
Balloons.

477
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:20,274
They come down in my place, your place,
everybody's place.

478
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:23,077
Even my dog's recognized
the damn things by now.

479
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:26,177
l think we should
go find that rancher.

480
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:29,953
Let's do it.

481
00:40:32,593 --> 00:40:34,148
Over there.
lsn't that him?

482
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,755
Hey, mac?
mac?

483
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:46,329
Yeah?
can we talk to you?

484
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:49,196
what do y'all need?
have you seen this?

485
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:51,569
what?

486
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:57,507
''it's a weather--'' weather balloon?

487
00:40:57,644 --> 00:40:59,304
That's a bunch of horse shit.

488
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:02,976
''a hair ass rancher--''
that's ''harassed.''

489
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:05,775
That's horse shit too. l'll tell you
what this is about.

490
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:07,647
Are you mac brazel?
yeah.

491
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:10,276
You're coming with me. l'm what?
hey!

492
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,520
Let's go!
Get in! Let's go!

493
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:22,357
Hey, what are you--

494
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:24,859
now, what l heard was that
they took him to the base...

495
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,694
And grilled him
for three days.

496
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:30,062
i'm gonna tell you something,
and y'all better listen to me.

497
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,203
You don't got no right doin' this.
You hear me?

498
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:36,640
l'm a private goddamn citizen.
You understand me?

499
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:38,707
l'll tell you something else.
l'm gonna write my congressman.

500
00:41:38,842 --> 00:41:41,073
You bet your sweet ass
i'm gonna write my congressman.

501
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:44,947
l don't know what the hell
this country's going to. Mr. Brayzel--

502
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:48,650
lt's brazel! Goddamn it! You don't
even know my goddamn name!

503
00:41:48,649 --> 00:41:51,914
we were talkin' before about
what it means to be a patriot.

504
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:55,979
You don't know what that means,
mister. You better read the bill of rights.

505
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,545
where does it say anything
in the bill of rights...

506
00:41:57,722 --> 00:42:00,055
About kidnapping private
citizens off the street?

507
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:03,456
why don't you show me that amendment.
Show me that page number, man!

508
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,756
when national security's at stake,
rules don't mean a thing.

509
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:07,762
Goddamn it! l don't wanna hear
that shit anymore either!

510
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:10,992
Christ! You think i'm some kind of fool
just 'cause l wear a cowboy hat?

511
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:14,294
l know what l saw.
l held it in my goddamn hands!

512
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,764
They said the material
was a weather balloon.

513
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:20,504
well, how in the hell does a weather
balloon affect our national security?

514
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:22,140
Huh?

515
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:27,671
Maybe i'm just stupider than l think
i am. Now, l don't get this.

516
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:31,314
l mean, unless y'all
are expectin' some sort of surprise balloon attack.

517
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,182
Look, there's just
two possibilities here.

518
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:39,483
Either that damn thing is a flyin' saucer,
or it ain't.

519
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:42,523
And if it is, well,
i'm owed $3,000.

520
00:42:45,027 --> 00:42:49,895
And if it ain't, then it's real simple.
l ain't owed nothin'.

521
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:54,425
lf you get my drift.

522
00:43:12,348 --> 00:43:14,509
now, you say this is
completely authorized? oh, yeah.

523
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:17,273
Yeah, it's completely
authorized.

524
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:21,317
l-i think it's time
we set the record straight.

525
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:26,315
l reckon l knew all along that that
stuff out there wasn't from outer space.

526
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:28,392
And after all them stories
come out about it--

527
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:30,687
then he just
out and out recants.

528
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:33,194
Says his conscience
has been bothering him a lot,

529
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:36,424
So he figured he'd better tell everyone
what really went on out there.

530
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,433
Then maybe he wouldn't
feel so bad.

531
00:43:41,169 --> 00:43:43,364
You found this
a half month earlier?

532
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:44,869
Yeah, thereabouts.

533
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:47,703
lt just laid out there for a while. l didn't
think nothin' of it,

534
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:51,534
Till l started hearin' all them stories
about flyin' disks.

535
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,643
Then some neighbors stopped by
my place one afternoon.

536
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:58,747
They said something about somebody offerin'
a reward for pieces of disk or whatever.

537
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:00,910
l figured, what the hell,
i'd give it a shot.

538
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:03,917
But the debris. well, yeah.
l mean, that was just...

539
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,621
Tin foil and scotch tape
and balsa wood, l guess.

540
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:11,983
Hell, l never thought it'd cause this kind
of hullabaloo.

541
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,755
Thanks, mac.

542
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:19,456
Off the record,
what's the truth?

543
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:21,490
The truth?

544
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,062
l'll tell you the truth.

545
00:44:25,202 --> 00:44:28,035
You know how sometimes folks,
they talk about little green men?

546
00:44:30,673 --> 00:44:32,607
well, they ain't green.

547
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:51,920
where in the hell did he get
the money for that? l don't know.

548
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:02,660
##

549
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:05,123
Do you think they bribed him?
i don't know.

550
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:07,961
l'm not sure l wanna know.
Yeah.

551
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:11,032
Listen, thanks.
l appreciate it.

552
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:13,161
Hey, tread easy.
lt's not a game.

553
00:45:31,388 --> 00:45:33,877
Scotch and soda.
Make that two.

554
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:38,822
what do you want? l wanna know
what was in that report.

555
00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:41,393
lt's been 30 years, sherman.
l think you can tell me now.

556
00:45:41,527 --> 00:45:44,553
what report?
july, 1947.

557
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,689
First off, l wasn't even here
during that whole time.

558
00:45:48,033 --> 00:45:50,332
what are you-- according to base,
i was on leave.

559
00:45:50,868 --> 00:45:53,302
No, we went up
to that ranch together.

560
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:55,667
lf you believe that, l can only tell you that
your recollection is faulty,

561
00:45:55,873 --> 00:45:57,806
Because l wasn't here
at the time, all right?

562
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:00,741
well, no, it's not all right!
Dance time, dear.

563
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:03,369
Excuse us, won't you?

564
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,011
be with you in a second, sir.

565
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,421
This isn't good for you.

566
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,286
Really, jess.
l know.

567
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,818
lt's gonna lead to nothing
but more pain.

568
00:46:23,326 --> 00:46:25,851
l mean, if you don't care about
your health, why should i?

569
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:28,554
Still play any golf,
jess?

570
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:32,731
l haven't for years. lt's bad for
his emphysema.

571
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:36,160
what do you think
they have golf carts for?

572
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:38,095
Didn't bring my clubs.

573
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,100
You'll rent some.

574
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,142
and carson actually
denied being here?

575
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:49,212
Said he was away on leave.

576
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:53,907
why are you really
doing this, jesse?

577
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,308
l'm tired of living a lie, lewis.
Oh, come on.

578
00:46:57,686 --> 00:47:01,143
How long you been married?
you never lied? your wife never lied?

579
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:04,324
lf it weren't for lies,
we'd never get through.

580
00:47:04,424 --> 00:47:07,622
They used me. They also promoted you,
jess.

581
00:47:07,794 --> 00:47:09,557
we all know that, man.

582
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:13,998
You were a good soldier. l think you
ought to stay that way.

583
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,794
l don't want to go
to my grave not knowin'.

584
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,734
l have a right to know.
l think we all do.

585
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:25,874
This is dangerous.

586
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:29,099
Tell anybody l said any of this,
i'll deny it.

587
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:30,871
You understand?

588
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:37,347
First of all, carson was there. l know this
because he took me to the sight with him.

589
00:47:37,484 --> 00:47:40,351
Said he wanted another
set of eyes on this.

590
00:47:40,418 --> 00:47:42,512
Guess you'd been sent off
to ft. worth.

591
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,155
Looks like half the town
is here.

592
00:47:54,064 --> 00:47:56,656
Now, the reason that i'm not telling you
anything is that...

593
00:47:56,765 --> 00:47:59,394
l want your honest,
untarnished response.

594
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,901
And l don't care how farfetched
or foolish it is.

595
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:04,766
Fine.

596
00:48:19,517 --> 00:48:21,040
what do you think
made that gouge?

597
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:23,317
we figure that's where
it hit the ground.

598
00:48:23,452 --> 00:48:25,784
But to me, the most
puzzling feature is...

599
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:27,580
we were unable to locate
any rivets.

600
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:30,381
l mean, how in the hell
was that thing held together?

601
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:32,419
There aren't even
any seams.

602
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,456
And as if
that weren't weird enough,

603
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:38,963
There seems to be
no engine, no moving parts.

604
00:48:39,465 --> 00:48:41,365
l mean,
how did that thing fly?

605
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:45,369
Maybe the engine's
somewheres else.

606
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:48,804
Maybe this is just
a part of it.

607
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,732
This doesn't even feel
like metal.

608
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:36,873
More like skin.

609
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:40,278
This was where? about two
and a half miles east of here.

610
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:41,875
Over here!

611
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,238
Uh, just you, mr. Carson.

612
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:54,683
wait here.

613
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:14,635
over here.
Check it out.

614
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:27,476
So what did you find?

615
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:29,310
Nothing.

616
00:50:29,884 --> 00:50:31,283
Nothing?

617
00:50:33,053 --> 00:50:35,681
By the way,
you weren't here today.

618
00:50:36,422 --> 00:50:37,753
That's what l figured.

619
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:41,149
was l with you?

620
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:47,063
Not sure yet.
But, uh,

621
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:48,794
l'll let you know.

622
00:50:49,364 --> 00:50:51,264
so you never saw
the second site?

623
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:52,731
No.

624
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:55,967
Stanton and harris--
you know them?

625
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,398
No.

626
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:00,634
They're both here. They may have been
at the second site.

627
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,376
Really? what'd they see?
ask them.

628
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,908
Come on, lewis. l can't tell you
anything more.

629
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,411
The army's worked
very hard to bury this.

630
00:51:11,449 --> 00:51:13,245
They want to
keep it that way.

631
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:24,684
Excuse me, fellas.
ls one of you named stanton?

632
00:51:27,094 --> 00:51:30,130
- yeah.
- could l talk to you?

633
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,097
Hey.

634
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,299
He looks a little different
from his picture.

635
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,197
Hell, he's a lot older.

636
00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:40,068
l think you, uh,
want to talk to him too.

637
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:46,008
- really?
- he flew the spotter plane.

638
00:51:46,175 --> 00:51:49,736
Yeah. l flew the one
that found the second site.

639
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:54,714
- you mind if l join you?
- no, not at all.

640
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,277
go ahead.

641
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:03,752
l don't give a damn. l'll tell anyone.
l mean it.

642
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:05,847
l was flying
pan am, right?

643
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,390
And l spot this long, shiny thing
like a... Cigar tube.

644
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,926
Bigger than my plane.
Practically runs into me.

645
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:15,397
So l report it,
like i'm supposed to.

646
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:18,031
By the book. l fill out
a mountain of papers.

647
00:52:18,267 --> 00:52:20,428
They can me.
Fired.

648
00:52:20,635 --> 00:52:22,102
Said l was unfit.

649
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:25,727
''fine,'' l says. ''give me
the lie detector test.''

650
00:52:26,006 --> 00:52:27,564
''out,'' they says.

651
00:52:27,774 --> 00:52:31,140
That's what you get when you tell
the truth, so fuck 'em, screw 'em.

652
00:52:32,978 --> 00:52:34,637
About the second site?

653
00:52:36,713 --> 00:52:38,477
The second site,
yeah.

654
00:52:39,382 --> 00:52:41,815
we were checking the area around
the first site,

655
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,476
The evidence of other debris
and things like that.

656
00:52:52,992 --> 00:52:56,428
Suddenly l saw something
kind of, well, glittering.

657
00:52:56,561 --> 00:52:58,792
l couldn't tell what it was because
of the sun's position,

658
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,721
So l took her down
for a closer look.

659
00:53:03,432 --> 00:53:06,334
lt was a cylindrical object i'd say
30 feet in length.

660
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:08,870
Oh, no.
lt was larger, round.

661
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:12,899
well, maybe not cylindrical.
Circular.

662
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:16,375
Yeah. But it was dome-shaped, definitely.
Absolutely dome-shaped.

663
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:17,908
lt was not dome-shaped.

664
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:23,313
All right. Maybe ''domed'' is the
wrong word. lt was kind of like an egg.

665
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,483
Yeah. l'm there.

666
00:53:29,587 --> 00:53:32,181
How the hell did he ever
get his pilot's license?

667
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:33,820
Hey! Hey!

668
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:35,553
l saw it.

669
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:40,619
And l saw
the bodies too.

670
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:42,596
Bodies?

671
00:53:43,363 --> 00:53:44,922
Five or six of 'em.

672
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,234
- there weren't that many.
-all right. All right.

673
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,199
l was flying fast. l didn't really have
time to count.

674
00:53:55,308 --> 00:53:58,333
But l definitely saw three bodies.
Maybe four.

675
00:53:58,642 --> 00:54:01,441
The main point is,
there were bodies.

676
00:54:01,678 --> 00:54:03,941
Yeah. Of monkeys.

677
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:08,176
Rhesus monkeys. Chimpanzees.
Something like that.

678
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:12,517
And what they're in is some kind
of experimental rocket, like an a-9.

679
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,551
And what happened was,

680
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:18,318
lt exploded, went off-range,
and that's why it was all hushed up.

681
00:54:18,525 --> 00:54:22,051
l don't know who you are, but you don't
know what the hell you're talking about.

682
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:26,493
Really? l don't know what about?
have you guys listened to yourselves?

683
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,497
Hey, l know what a monkey looks like.
lt's not what l saw.

684
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:33,193
From where? a hundred feet
flying by? whiz-bang?

685
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,196
That was a monkey with all of its hair
singed off,

686
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,140
His head swollen up like a melon
from decompression.

687
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:45,336
No eyes. They were popped out,
leaving nothing but these black holes.

688
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:48,476
That thing was like
no monkey you ever saw.

689
00:54:49,617 --> 00:54:50,708
l've seen 'em.

690
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:54,376
The government didn't launch
monkeys till '52. Yeah?

691
00:54:54,786 --> 00:54:56,685
How do you know?

692
00:55:02,558 --> 00:55:06,221
you saw the bodies.
You think they were monkeys?

693
00:55:06,795 --> 00:55:09,228
l didn't see any bodies.
l smelled 'em.

694
00:55:09,365 --> 00:55:13,060
-come on. - i'm telling you what i
know. Brown saw the bodies.

695
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,928
Brown?

696
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:19,368
Melvin brown. Sergeant melvin brown,
my buddy. Now deceased.

697
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,068
Him and me,
we were supposed to guard...

698
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:25,641
whatever these-- you know--
on the way back to the base.

699
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,772
So, what do you think's
under there?

700
00:55:29,914 --> 00:55:31,540
They told us
not to look.

701
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:34,305
l'm not saying ''look.''
i'm saying ''think.''

702
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:35,780
l don't know.

703
00:55:37,386 --> 00:55:39,649
whatever it is, l don't think the ice
is doing the job.

704
00:55:39,788 --> 00:55:42,449
Hey, keep your head tilted this way.
lt's not so bad.

705
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,453
lt wasn't like an order.
what?

706
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,116
Not to look.
l thought they said ''please.''

707
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:48,784
whoever says ''please''
around here?

708
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,863
he was yakkin' on
about look, don't look.

709
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:54,992
l mean, l was curious too.
But orders are orders.

710
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:57,033
You gonna tell
if l do?

711
00:55:57,701 --> 00:55:59,396
Only if i'm asked.

712
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:02,999
Tell you what. why don't you just
face in that direction...

713
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:05,800
And then you won't know
if l looked or not.

714
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:07,637
Maybe l did
and maybe l didn't.

715
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,801
All right.

716
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:34,925
Did he ever tell you
what it was he saw?

717
00:56:36,298 --> 00:56:37,821
He was too upset
to talk about it.

718
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,056
well, l saw the coffins.

719
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:44,026
we didn't know what we were
building back then,

720
00:56:44,203 --> 00:56:46,672
But they told us they were just
boxes, you know?

721
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:49,341
But, hey, there were...

722
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:51,741
Four little boxes...

723
00:56:52,043 --> 00:56:53,738
And one big one.

724
00:56:54,045 --> 00:56:55,672
bring it on in!

725
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:12,320
atten-shun!

726
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:22,928
They told us not to look--just turn
around and walk away.

727
00:57:23,702 --> 00:57:26,497
So you never saw
what was in the ambulance?

728
00:57:27,104 --> 00:57:29,799
Right.
Did you smell anything?

729
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:32,872
Come on! No, l didn't smell
anything.

730
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:34,703
They were probably
in body bags by then.

731
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:36,911
You know who might
have seen 'em?

732
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:40,470
The mortician over at corona.
what's his name?

733
00:57:41,847 --> 00:57:46,580
Paul davis? uh, david paulous--
something like that.

734
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,945
l think.

735
00:58:11,437 --> 00:58:13,531
Are you the one that called?
yeah.

736
00:58:20,412 --> 00:58:22,469
Do you really think
they'll come after you?

737
00:58:22,645 --> 00:58:24,204
They said they would.

738
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:28,141
Hey, these guys were not kidding,
all right?

739
00:58:28,483 --> 00:58:31,681
l mean, they even came in and picked up
the press release, the one you guys sent out.

740
00:58:32,486 --> 00:58:36,388
From the radio station, from the
newspaper, they just came in, picked it up...

741
00:58:36,423 --> 00:58:38,288
ln and out,
no more paper trail.

742
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:39,925
Total denial.

743
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:43,558
That rancher was threatened.
The sheriff was threatened.

744
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,327
l knew these people,
and they threatened me.

745
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:52,061
- that was 30 years ago. - yeah, well,
maybe i'll just wait 30 more.

746
00:58:52,169 --> 00:58:54,762
well, l don't have
30 years.

747
00:58:55,004 --> 00:58:56,699
l probably don't have two.

748
00:58:56,839 --> 00:58:59,534
Now, i'm asking,
man to man.

749
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:06,937
well, if it's any help to you, l know
that that weather balloon thing was a lie.

750
00:59:07,414 --> 00:59:09,973
l know that.
That's not what i'm here for.

751
00:59:11,183 --> 00:59:14,744
Look, l just don't want to get
involved in this, all right?

752
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,851
l mean, as far as i'm concerned,
it never goddamn happened.

753
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:20,684
Now, have you got it?
please.

754
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:22,917
please.

755
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:35,061
Aw, hell.

756
00:59:36,435 --> 00:59:38,336
Nobody's gonna
believe it anyway.

757
00:59:42,974 --> 00:59:45,169
l was working late
on this fella.

758
00:59:45,976 --> 00:59:50,437
l usually don't work at night,
but the phone rings.

759
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:59,117
Funeral home. lt's some captain
from the base.

760
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:01,984
Yes, captain,
we carry those.

761
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:05,054
How many?

762
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,724
well, now, gee,
that sure is an awful lot.

763
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:10,351
Hold on
and let me go see.

764
01:00:10,562 --> 01:00:13,690
l checked to see how many
small caskets we have.

765
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:16,159
l'm afraid l only have
one in stock.

766
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,365
But now, l could order
more, of course.

767
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:20,593
Now he asks something strange.

768
01:00:20,737 --> 01:00:21,931
Can they be what?

769
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:24,830
Hermetically sealed?

770
01:00:25,807 --> 01:00:28,503
well, uh, i-i guess
they could.

771
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,204
But frankly we don't have
too much call for that around here.

772
01:00:32,346 --> 01:00:36,644
Folks are generally pretty satisfied
if these things just close.

773
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:39,114
And then he says
he wants them tonight.

774
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,982
Tonight?
uh, no, sir.

775
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:45,546
The soonest that l could
possibly have them for you...

776
01:00:45,723 --> 01:00:47,247
would be day after tomorrow.

777
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:50,256
So he asks how he can
preserve the bodies now.

778
01:00:50,592 --> 01:00:53,027
well, uh, in that case,

779
01:00:53,163 --> 01:00:55,596
l would say dry ice.

780
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,896
Captain, how did
these kids die?

781
01:01:04,104 --> 01:01:06,504
l decided to go
to the base myself,

782
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,904
See if l could help.

783
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:11,537
Hi, david.
Go ahead.

784
01:01:11,742 --> 01:01:13,607
My girlfriend worked there
as a nurse,

785
01:01:13,776 --> 01:01:16,675
And l figured she would know
what was what.

786
01:01:19,216 --> 01:01:20,648
But as l drove on,

787
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:24,843
l saw that the base
was swarming with activity--

788
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:30,022
Night lights and nonmilitary
guys in dark suits.

789
01:01:30,657 --> 01:01:32,624
lt was like the whole place
was on...

790
01:01:32,758 --> 01:01:34,589
Some kind of an alert.

791
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,063
Has there been some kind
of an accident?

792
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:47,633
Not that l know of.

793
01:01:56,642 --> 01:01:58,200
Oh, i'm sorry.

794
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:03,112
Um, i-i gather
some kids were killed.

795
01:02:04,381 --> 01:02:07,714
At least, that's what l understand.
l wouldn't know about that.

796
01:02:09,186 --> 01:02:10,653
what the hell
are you doin' here?

797
01:02:10,854 --> 01:02:15,789
Oh, i'm a local mortician.
l was called by captain-- some captain.

798
01:02:15,925 --> 01:02:17,447
Oh? okay.

799
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,986
Janet.

800
01:02:21,494 --> 01:02:23,019
Janet.

801
01:02:26,098 --> 01:02:27,588
what's happening here?

802
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:30,562
what are you doing here? l was just--
i just thought that--

803
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:33,467
Get out. l'm telling you,
get out of here.

804
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:35,128
l mean it!
Hey, you!

805
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:38,598
what are you doing?
you don't belong here.

806
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,741
wait a minute!
Let me go!

807
01:02:42,244 --> 01:02:43,804
what the hell is this?

808
01:02:44,313 --> 01:02:46,110
Let me go.
l can walk.

809
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:50,108
l was told there'd been an accident.
You heard wrong!

810
01:02:50,284 --> 01:02:53,981
But l was called-- l said,
you heard wrong.

811
01:02:56,055 --> 01:02:58,455
You don't have to be
so damn nasty.

812
01:03:06,128 --> 01:03:08,996
l called janet,
but she didn't want to talk.

813
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,964
She said she might meet me
when she got off work.

814
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,501
Hi.
Hi.

815
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:24,770
May l take your order?
um, uh, the same.

816
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,105
Okay.

817
01:03:26,812 --> 01:03:29,507
So what was going on
back there?

818
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,983
You must never tell
anyone...

819
01:03:31,983 --> 01:03:33,712
what i'm about to say.

820
01:03:34,617 --> 01:03:35,914
l want you to promise.

821
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:38,782
Janet--
promise me.

822
01:03:38,921 --> 01:03:40,183
Promise.

823
01:03:40,957 --> 01:03:43,083
Okay, okay, l promise.

824
01:03:44,959 --> 01:03:47,827
Terrible things could happen
to me if they found--

825
01:03:51,063 --> 01:03:54,499
David, the base is crawling with hotshots.
who?

826
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,330
l don't know. These guys have been coming
in from washington by the planeload.

827
01:03:58,671 --> 01:04:00,036
Thank you.
You're welcome.

828
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,401
So?

829
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,133
That's not all l saw.

830
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:11,078
l saw the bodies.

831
01:04:12,247 --> 01:04:13,909
what bodies?

832
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:16,214
They were--

833
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:20,149
They were fetus-shaped.
They were s--

834
01:04:20,253 --> 01:04:21,551
They had these--

835
01:04:25,356 --> 01:04:27,119
They weren't human,
david.

836
01:04:27,859 --> 01:04:31,122
l walked in while they were performing
their autopsies.

837
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:33,021
God, the stench.

838
01:04:33,296 --> 01:04:35,355
People with their hands
over their noses.

839
01:04:36,065 --> 01:04:38,830
Men i'd never seen before, they were
taking all these pictures of these...

840
01:04:39,002 --> 01:04:41,025
Bodies.

841
01:04:52,813 --> 01:04:53,972
Janet--

842
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:02,413
-janet--

843
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:05,212
Janet,
it's gonna be okay.

844
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:14,189
l'm fine.

845
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:17,222
You okay?
mm-hmm.

846
01:05:28,773 --> 01:05:30,933
Can l keep this?
uh-uh.

847
01:05:34,009 --> 01:05:35,238
where's janet now?

848
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:38,381
She died in a plane crash.

849
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:42,438
At least,
that's what they said.

850
01:05:52,224 --> 01:05:55,489
No, he's not here right now.
l've told you that. who is this, please?

851
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:58,152
jess, where were you?

852
01:05:58,262 --> 01:06:00,229
who is this?
jess, i'm scared.

853
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:03,060
why don't you just tell me
who this is, okay?

854
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:06,029
Yes, hello?

855
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:08,060
l know what
you're trying to do.

856
01:06:08,737 --> 01:06:10,898
You should look in to
the case of gary ward.

857
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:13,735
He committed suicide
six months ago.

858
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:17,735
Or was it a car accident?

859
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:21,736
Great. Now, do you see
where this is getting you?

860
01:06:22,748 --> 01:06:25,910
This is happening because i'm getting
closer to it. Sit down.

861
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,883
You're close to nothing.
Face it, dad.

862
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,518
You're never gonna find
what you're looking for.

863
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:35,847
You just want an answer, like there's
proof out there of god or an afterlife.

864
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:40,688
U.F.O.S-- it's all the same thing. Something
to hang on to when nothing makes sense.

865
01:06:40,828 --> 01:06:43,130
This is fantasy to make you feel
better in the night.

866
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:47,259
lt's the truth, and you know it.
Or you used to know it.

867
01:06:47,534 --> 01:06:49,194
You were there, son,
in the kitchen with me.

868
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,962
You saw what l saw.
You held it in your hands.

869
01:06:51,069 --> 01:06:54,595
lf you choose to run away from that,
that's up to you. l'll do this alone.

870
01:06:54,771 --> 01:06:56,705
- please do it alone. - stop it.
- no, l will not.

871
01:06:56,841 --> 01:07:00,799
- look what you're doing to us!
- look whatthey'redoing to us.

872
01:07:26,664 --> 01:07:29,632
l want you to know something.
l really admire you...

873
01:07:29,832 --> 01:07:31,299
For what you're doing.

874
01:07:42,709 --> 01:07:45,076
Excuse me. Major?

875
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:47,177
Uh, could we talk?

876
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:14,293
So you saw the bodies? no, sir.
But, uh, we know people who did.

877
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,300
One of them was on the medical staff
and the other was, uh,

878
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:19,461
Helping recover the bodies
from the crash scene.

879
01:08:19,604 --> 01:08:22,903
what did they look like? one guy says that
they were-- they were...

880
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:25,337
Like real humans
with real smooth skin.

881
01:08:25,443 --> 01:08:27,843
That was the guy from the crash site.
Right, but the other one--

882
01:08:27,878 --> 01:08:32,372
He was from the autopsy room, and he
insists that they were really small, like children.

883
01:08:32,516 --> 01:08:36,177
But much frailer, and they had
sort of scaly skin.

884
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:40,014
Like a reptile, sort of. And their
heads were shaped sort of like eggs.

885
01:08:40,187 --> 01:08:42,418
No, no, like a pear.
Like an upside-down pear.

886
01:08:42,588 --> 01:08:44,282
A little more like eggs.
No.

887
01:08:44,389 --> 01:08:47,883
were these guys making this up?
uh-uh. No way. Neither of them.

888
01:08:47,994 --> 01:08:50,187
we know these guys.
They were really scared.

889
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:52,521
Look, l was shot down
overjapan, okay?

890
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:56,597
l know what scared looks like. lt was nothing
compared to the look on these guys' faces.

891
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,170
Captain henry enicht,
who left us...

892
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,534
One rainy morning
in august of 1969,

893
01:09:07,374 --> 01:09:10,342
And lt. Colonel
everett pryor,

894
01:09:10,543 --> 01:09:13,445
who passed away
one year ago today.

895
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:16,573
You will all be sorely missed.

896
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:19,314
Bugler, please.

897
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:24,615
##

898
01:09:30,393 --> 01:09:31,916
Excuse me, please.

899
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:37,022
l wonder if l could talk to you privately
for a few minutes.

900
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:41,057
##

901
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:55,170
There's nothing to be
afraid of. Come on inside.

902
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,639
we hear you're thinking
about talking.

903
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,509
That could be
very risky.

904
01:10:05,751 --> 01:10:08,651
l've been tracking this story,
and l know the chances you're taking.

905
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,119
who are you? some people
call me townsend.

906
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:16,085
My name's not important. l've been
on the same search that you have.

907
01:10:16,192 --> 01:10:18,524
But l think l may
have gone much deeper.

908
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:21,395
l don't know if i
believe it all, but...

909
01:10:21,496 --> 01:10:23,293
This is what
i found out.

910
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:28,630
Supposedly, four tiny bodies were
recovered from the crash, right?

911
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:30,529
Right.

912
01:10:31,571 --> 01:10:34,471
well, they did bring them
back here to the base.

913
01:10:34,607 --> 01:10:35,835
Eyes: almond shaped.

914
01:10:36,008 --> 01:10:38,944
No discernible
auditory lobes.

915
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,843
Skin texture:
slightly scaly,

916
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:43,948
Almost reptilian.

917
01:10:44,247 --> 01:10:47,809
Stretchable,
somewhat elastic,

918
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:49,677
Over what feels like...

919
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:51,375
Smooth muscle.

920
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:55,522
ln skeletal tissues, no striated muscle
discernible.

921
01:10:56,422 --> 01:11:00,653
ln the thoracic area,
also no striated muscle.

922
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:04,994
Mouth would seem to be
a wrinkle-tight fold.

923
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:08,160
A colorless liquid
present in the body.

924
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:10,857
Doesn't seem to be
what we call blood.

925
01:11:11,569 --> 01:11:13,697
Uh, seems to have...

926
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:17,730
No digestive system.

927
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:20,001
No gastrointestinal tract.

928
01:11:22,276 --> 01:11:24,106
There's no rectal area.

929
01:11:27,447 --> 01:11:29,642
No reproductive organs.

930
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,977
No genitalia.

931
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:35,116
No teeth.

932
01:11:37,856 --> 01:11:40,756
The mouth opens to a cavity
about two inches deep-- hey!

933
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:43,991
This one just moved!

934
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:00,194
He was alive?

935
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:02,439
ltwas alive.

936
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:06,542
This information went
straight to the president, and his response...

937
01:12:06,644 --> 01:12:09,373
was to form a top-secret
commission to deal with it.

938
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,141
Under what agency
will we be operating?

939
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:14,716
None. we will have
complete control.

940
01:12:15,718 --> 01:12:17,653
Morning, mr. Secretary.
Good morning.

941
01:12:17,787 --> 01:12:20,021
And our mandate,
exactly?

942
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,582
To investigate the event
and all of its, uh,

943
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:26,419
lmplications--
the technology.

944
01:12:26,527 --> 01:12:29,756
And any other such events,
should they occur.

945
01:12:30,062 --> 01:12:32,395
But most of all, to safeguard
the public interest.

946
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,100
That's why this information has to be so
carefully controlled.

947
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:38,466
Think of our religious institutions.
l mean,

948
01:12:38,569 --> 01:12:42,562
lf this were all to just
come out, what are people going to believe in?

949
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:46,573
Not to mention the effect
on our social and our political institutions.

950
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:48,907
Even the military?

951
01:12:49,044 --> 01:12:50,704
Especially the military.

952
01:12:51,078 --> 01:12:53,309
l mean, what the hell
are we dealing with here?

953
01:12:53,413 --> 01:12:56,677
ls it friendly? is it hostile?
maybe it's neither.

954
01:12:56,817 --> 01:12:59,717
Maybe they're just studying us the way
we study insects.

955
01:12:59,985 --> 01:13:04,056
well, the point is, there could be panic
if this all came out.

956
01:13:04,055 --> 01:13:08,058
we're supposed to ensure
domestic tranquility, not eliminate it.

957
01:13:08,058 --> 01:13:12,154
l mean, what-- what if people
think that we are not in control of the skies?

958
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:14,159
They'd be right.

959
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:20,826
what about leaks? someone's bound
to say something.

960
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:24,793
well, as long as we control
the way the information is released,

961
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:27,066
Leaks shouldn't
necessarily hurt us.

962
01:13:27,108 --> 01:13:31,202
ln fact, mingled with a little
well placed disinformation, they should help.

963
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:33,743
Hoaxes. Oh, yes.
Certainly.

964
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,171
And also accurate information
released...

965
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:38,370
From less-than-reputable
sources.

966
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:40,749
That's not such
a bad technique either.

967
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:44,110
- recruit a group of crackpots?
- exactly.

968
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,587
Gentlemen, if you'd open
the folders in front of you.

969
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:52,716
As you can see,
under magnification...

970
01:13:53,094 --> 01:13:56,459
The creature's skin appears to be, uh,
mesh-like.

971
01:13:56,562 --> 01:14:00,190
- rather like that of a lizard.
- has there been any communication?

972
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:03,391
From?
it, to us.

973
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:05,692
Uh, not sure.
Possibly.

974
01:14:06,303 --> 01:14:09,238
we believe that it may use
some form of, uh,

975
01:14:10,305 --> 01:14:11,933
Thought projection.

976
01:14:12,642 --> 01:14:15,610
At least, that's what the men
who've been close to it seem to think.

977
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:20,111
- how long do we keep this to ourselves?
- well, there's no telling.

978
01:14:20,213 --> 01:14:22,739
we will determine that.
why?

979
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:28,110
l think mankind has the right to know
about something as significant as this.

980
01:14:32,157 --> 01:14:35,292
well, yes. Of course.

981
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:38,284
we don't intend to keep this
under wraps forever.

982
01:14:40,496 --> 01:14:41,861
Right.

983
01:14:42,531 --> 01:14:46,023
Okay.
Good. Fine.

984
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:51,034
So what they decided to do
was build some secret bases...

985
01:14:51,204 --> 01:14:53,900
Out in the middle of the desert
to study all this.

986
01:14:57,376 --> 01:15:00,511
But secretary forrestal demanded
that he see for himself...

987
01:15:00,511 --> 01:15:02,307
what was going on out there.

988
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,264
ln here, gentlemen.

989
01:15:46,848 --> 01:15:48,212
How are you doing
today?

990
01:15:50,015 --> 01:15:53,712
Oh, uh, let me check, and i'll see what
i can do, okay?

991
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:03,660
He knows you're here. l thought
this was mirrored.

992
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,359
lt is.

993
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:18,897
jesus!
what's the matter, james?

994
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,473
Oh! More of them
are coming.

995
01:16:25,444 --> 01:16:28,105
-what do you mean?
- different ones.

996
01:16:28,746 --> 01:16:30,235
Not like him.

997
01:16:31,081 --> 01:16:32,709
Many different races,

998
01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:34,715
Different species.

999
01:16:36,118 --> 01:16:37,677
They're coming!

1000
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:42,722
are you okay?

1001
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:48,124
Yeah.
Yeah, i'm all right.

1002
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:59,259
oh, my god.

1003
01:16:59,436 --> 01:17:01,494
Oh, shit. No, no, no,
no, no, no!

1004
01:17:01,671 --> 01:17:04,298
Something's happening here.
Norman, we're losing him!

1005
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:08,466
Check the cardiogram for arrhythmia.
Get an endo tube, stat!

1006
01:17:09,678 --> 01:17:13,170
Communicate.
Tell me what to do!

1007
01:17:13,747 --> 01:17:15,839
Please, what can we
do for you?

1008
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,721
Oh, god!

1009
01:17:35,596 --> 01:17:38,293
So where's the body?
the one that died?

1010
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,799
Have you seen it?
no.

1011
01:17:42,102 --> 01:17:43,866
l have seen photographs.

1012
01:17:44,104 --> 01:17:46,902
Photographs can be faked.
That's true.

1013
01:17:47,173 --> 01:17:50,631
But the people whose word i've
come to rely on insist they were not.

1014
01:17:50,775 --> 01:17:54,872
what's more, they maintain
that secretary forrestal was correct...

1015
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:58,470
when he said he somehow sensed
that more of them would be coming.

1016
01:17:58,682 --> 01:18:01,150
And they say further contact
did, in fact, take place.

1017
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:05,548
Now, if that's true, what happened here is
merely the tip of the iceberg.

1018
01:18:06,488 --> 01:18:08,757
Thank you all for coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

1019
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:10,883
l hope we all
meet again soon.

1020
01:18:23,802 --> 01:18:26,065
The most talked-about incident
is said to have occurred...

1021
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:28,567
At holloman air force base
in 1964.

1022
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,228
l wasn't there personally,
but i'm given to understand...

1023
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:34,340
That a disc actually
landed by intention.

1024
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:37,840
And then an exchange
with alien life forms occurred.

1025
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,969
You know the movie--
close encounters?

1026
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,774
Yeah. lt was based
on that incident.

1027
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,641
But they may not have gotten it
quite right.

1028
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,842
You see, physicists
now speculate...

1029
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,151
That it's unlikely these things fly vast
distances from other solar systems,

1030
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:56,314
But that they come from a place
that's much closer and farther away.

1031
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:59,386
You see, there may not be
just one universe.

1032
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,086
Did you know that
mathematicians now theorize...

1033
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:04,592
That there could be
''multi-verses''--

1034
01:19:04,732 --> 01:19:06,529
Other dimensions that
coexist with our own,

1035
01:19:06,633 --> 01:19:11,091
And that these beings have the technology
to somehow just slip in and out.

1036
01:19:21,644 --> 01:19:23,442
Another alien visitor
claimed...

1037
01:19:23,579 --> 01:19:26,070
That his race had been looking in on us
for centuries,

1038
01:19:26,382 --> 01:19:29,475
And that they had, in fact,
influenced the course of human history...

1039
01:19:29,618 --> 01:19:32,518
ln some rather critical
and startling ways.

1040
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:35,122
This visitor
somehow displayed...

1041
01:19:35,122 --> 01:19:39,752
The way aliens have been genetically
altering the development of our dna...

1042
01:19:39,925 --> 01:19:44,361
From our very beginnings, and that
they had inspired our greatest spiritual leaders.

1043
01:19:44,629 --> 01:19:46,960
You're telling me
that the missing link...

1044
01:19:47,098 --> 01:19:49,531
Could be the result
of alien genetics?

1045
01:19:49,632 --> 01:19:51,430
l believe this information
is correct.

1046
01:19:51,568 --> 01:19:53,557
But who could really
say for certain?

1047
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:58,901
Ma, did you see
where dad went?

1048
01:19:59,006 --> 01:20:00,030
No, l didn't.

1049
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,068
well, okay. Let's not worry
about it.

1050
01:20:05,377 --> 01:20:07,869
l'm not worried about it.
Not anymore.

1051
01:20:09,414 --> 01:20:10,905
Do you see what's happened?

1052
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:13,614
No.

1053
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:17,916
There's a man that you and l used
to know when you were a boy,

1054
01:20:18,422 --> 01:20:20,446
The soldier
that was your dad.

1055
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:24,157
He's back.

1056
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:31,120
Over the years, there must be...
People like me,

1057
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:33,791
People who've wanted
to talk about what they know.

1058
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,794
l'm sure
there were some.

1059
01:20:37,237 --> 01:20:39,601
But then it's all so hard
to believe, isn't it?

1060
01:20:40,004 --> 01:20:43,634
l think that secretary forrestal tried,
or may have. l'm not sure.

1061
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:50,305
while he was at bethesda,
he was working on a diary...

1062
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,676
That was said to contain an account
of his experiences with alien life forms...

1063
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:56,883
And proof that the government was trying
to keep all this information covered up.

1064
01:20:58,052 --> 01:21:00,814
Apparently, he checked into the hospital
for over-exhaustion and stress.

1065
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:12,186
l'm sure that you personally
can sympathize...

1066
01:21:12,362 --> 01:21:14,965
with how difficult it would have
been for him to reveal...

1067
01:21:14,965 --> 01:21:16,694
All these secrets.

1068
01:21:30,009 --> 01:21:33,274
lf secretary forrestal left any
kind of note, it was never found.

1069
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,640
And his diaries
are still classified.

1070
01:21:36,115 --> 01:21:38,515
Since then, things have gotten
even more bizarre.

1071
01:21:38,616 --> 01:21:42,212
Planes vanishing, cattle mutilations,
human abductions.

1072
01:21:42,385 --> 01:21:44,445
And then there are
the stories of area 51.

1073
01:21:45,755 --> 01:21:47,519
what is area 51?

1074
01:21:48,357 --> 01:21:52,123
That's where people swear they've
actually seen recovered alien craft,

1075
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:53,990
And that we're working
with it right now.

1076
01:21:54,094 --> 01:21:55,925
how long have we
had this, colonel?

1077
01:21:56,029 --> 01:21:57,665
That depends on
who you talk to.

1078
01:21:57,665 --> 01:22:00,029
The top part is
antigravitational.

1079
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:02,824
ls this all true?

1080
01:22:04,569 --> 01:22:06,332
well, that's a good question.

1081
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:11,001
One must proceed cautiously here,
on guard against one's desire...

1082
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:14,040
To want it to be true
or want it not to be true.

1083
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:18,204
One must be, as much as possible,
neutral.

1084
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,506
well, how can you
be neutral?

1085
01:22:20,815 --> 01:22:24,512
A thing is either true or it's not. There is
no middle ground.

1086
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,348
All right, all right.

1087
01:22:29,656 --> 01:22:33,591
then none of it is true.

1088
01:22:34,727 --> 01:22:37,991
- none of it?
- well, maybe some of it.

1089
01:22:38,164 --> 01:22:41,394
Ugh!
Now you're playing with me.

1090
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:43,667
why are you playing
with me?

1091
01:22:44,267 --> 01:22:46,202
Because maybe you wouldn't
even know what was true...

1092
01:22:46,537 --> 01:22:48,163
lf you'd seen it all
for yourself.

1093
01:22:48,939 --> 01:22:52,339
How's that for an answer? then what
did l see out there in that field?

1094
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,871
Oh, that.

1095
01:22:56,177 --> 01:22:57,804
why, that was a weather balloon.

1096
01:22:57,912 --> 01:23:00,437
Hah! No, it wasn't.

1097
01:23:01,114 --> 01:23:03,774
l know what l saw, and it was not
from this world.

1098
01:23:03,915 --> 01:23:07,180
Don't you understand, jesse?
you have nothing.

1099
01:23:08,186 --> 01:23:11,121
Just a lot of old memories
and secondhand recollections.

1100
01:23:11,255 --> 01:23:13,688
Nobody is going to
take you seriously.

1101
01:23:13,857 --> 01:23:15,222
Not without proof.

1102
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,123
Not without hard evidence.

1103
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:26,227
But please, feel free
to tell anybody...

1104
01:23:26,366 --> 01:23:28,527
Anything that i've said
here this afternoon.

1105
01:23:28,568 --> 01:23:33,301
Because maybe it really is true. And the
public has a right to know, don't they?
