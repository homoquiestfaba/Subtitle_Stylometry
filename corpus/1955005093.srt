WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
A GALACTIC SNAPSHOT

00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,872

00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,548
THE CORE BELIEF

IS THEN INTERPRETED
USING THE 12 ZODIAC SIGNS

9
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,638
AS INDICATORS OF BEHAVIOR

10
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:39,183
TO PREDICT INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY TRAITS.

11
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,560
RIDICULOUS.

16
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,235
YOUR PRESENTATION COUNTS
FOR 40% OF YOUR FINAL GRADE,

17
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,029

TO CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE

18

204
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,884
MY NAME IS JAKE GIBSON.

205

206
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,852
AT ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL,
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

207
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,105
THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE
ALSO BORN ON THE SAME NIGHT,

208
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:06,109

HERE WE GOT SARAH REYNOLDS,

211
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,785
THE INTERNET IS KIND OF
AN AMAZING THING.

212
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,247
SO, BASED ON THE THEORY
OF ASTROLOGY,

213
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,208
ALL FOUR OF US SHARE
THE EXACT SAME HOROSCOPE,

214
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,463
AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD ALL
SHARE THE EXACT SAME FATE.

215
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,715
AND THAT'S BULLSHIT.

216
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:33,386

00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,305

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,199
(sighs)

354
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,825
YEAH.

355
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,827
RIGHT, THIS WHOLE
"I'M NOT A STALKER" THING,

356
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,537
IT'S NOT REALLY
WORKING OUT.

357
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,873
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

358
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,876
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU GOT HOME SAFE.

359
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,796
IT'S LATE, AND IT'S A
DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD.

360
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,589
YOU COULD
BE DANGEROUS.

361
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,678
TRUE. I COULD.

362
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,930
BUT I'M NOT.

363
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,519
ONE CUP OF COFFEE,
PLEASE?

364
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,071
YOU SHOULDN'T SMOKE.

365
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,908
IT'S BAD FOR YOU.

366
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,040
HMM.

367
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,211
THAT'S WHY I QUIT.

368
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,923
UGH. WHAT TIME IS IT?

369
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,675
WE COULD DO
APPLE PIE, EVEN.

370
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,593
I CAN'T, I JUST --
I GOTTA GO.

371
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,596
COME ON, A CUP OF COFFEE,
THAT'S IT. PLEASE, LISTEN.

372
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,266
I'M DESPERATE HERE, OKAY?

373
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,643
IF I DON'T PASS THIS CLASS,
I DON'T GRADUATE.

374
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,022
JUST A FEW QUESTIONS,
PLEASE.

375
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,315
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

376
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,487
AND WHO KNOWS?
IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO YOU, TOO.

377
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,912
I MUST BE CRAZY.
FOLLOW ME.

378
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,252
.P

379
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,757
HEY, SARAH.

380
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,550
HI, PATTY,
HOW'S IT GOING?

381
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,469
AH, PRETTY GOOD. YOU?

382
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,638
(sighs) IT'S BEEN
A LONG NIGHT.

383
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,098
IT'S GOOD.

384
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,142
MAYBE THIS'LL
WARM YOU UP.

385
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,643
- THERE YA GO.
- THANK YOU.

386
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,067
HE DRIVES
A MERCEDES OR A BMW?

387
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,986
I DON'T KNOW.
YOUR WIFE IS A PROBLEM.

388
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,489
PORSCHE TURBO.
DEFINITELY.

389
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,824
INTERESTING.

390
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:47,953
YEAH, MAYBE
THAT'S HIS WIFE.

391
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,957
OR HIS DAUGHTER.

392
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,210
OR HIS DAUGHTER, YEAH.

393
00:29:55,836 --> 00:30:00,216
SO, IS THAT GONNA
BE YOU ONE DAY'?

394
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,345
I DO DRIVE A PORSCHE.

395
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:09,350
IT'S A 1976914 I PAID
LESS THAN THREE GRAND FOR.

396
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,436
OH, WELL, NOT ENTIRELY.

397
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,355
THAT WAS UP UNTIL IT
WAS STOLEN YESTERDAY.

398
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,567
- HEY.
- I GOT IT. LET'S GO!

399
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,236
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HEY!

400
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,074
GET BACK HERE!

401
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,161
(growls )

402
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,006
SORRY TO HEAR.

403
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,843
MM-HMM, SO I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY,

404
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,720
AS BAD
AS YOUR DAY WAS,

405
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,056
I GOT YOU BEAT.

406
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:52,351
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO BELIEVE.

407
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,897
I'LL MAKE YOU
A DEAL.

408
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,859
IF I CAN MAKE
YOU SMILE,

409
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,527
YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR DAY.

410
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,237
IF I SMILE FIRST,

411
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:04,905
I WILL WALK OUT
THAT DOOR

412
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,115
AND NEVER BOTHER
YOU AGAIN.

413
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,581
LIKE A STARING CONTEST?
YOU KNOW...

414
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,624
- YEAH.
- SO, WHAT ARE THE RULES?

415
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,126
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

416
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:21,672
UM, YOU CAN'T LOOK AWAY,
AND YOU CAN'T SMILE.

417
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,093
YOU FORGET I HAVE
A THREE-YEAR OLD.

418
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,428
<i>OH...</i>

419
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:28,929
BUT SURE, LET'S PLAY.

420
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,057
EITHER WAY,
I'LL PICK UP THE TAB.

421
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,267
AHEM!

422
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,941
- WE STARTED? THIS IS--?
- YEAH, NOW WE ARE.

423
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,276
WE CAN BLINK, RIGHT?

424
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,956
SORRY FOR THE WAIT.

425
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,293
SHOULD I COME BACK?

426
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,628
NO, ACTUALLY.

427
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,796
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I
WERE JUST WONDERING

428
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,256
IF YOU WOULD
BE INTERESTED

429
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,799
IN HAVING
A THREESOME WITH US,

430
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,344
A MENAGE A TROIS,
IF YOU WILL.

431
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,513
YEAH.

432
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,307
HE'S JOKING. IT'S NOT...

433
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,808
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

434
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,769
SHE'S SHY ABOUT
THIS KIND OF THING.

435
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,481
ACTUALLY, WE ARE HERE ON
OUR THREE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY,

436
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:23,359
AND WE FIGURED YOU LOOKED
LIKE THE TYPE OF GIRL

437
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,030
THAT LIKES TO GET DOWN
AND PARTY. HEE HEE HEE!

438
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,990
HE'S JOKING,
IT'S JUST...

439
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,659
MM-HMM.

440
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:34,286
THAT'S A WINNER
RIGHT THERE.

441
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,704
- WELL, YOU CHEATED.
- NO.

442
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,539
I DIDN'T SAY
WE COULDN'T TALK.

443
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,668
I SAID
I WOULDN'T SMILE.

444
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,836
YES! ALL RIGHT.

445
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:48,175
I AM JUST
ABOUT... READY.

446
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,552
WELL, MY BIRTHDAY SUCKED.

447
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:59,186
YOU KNOW, I'VE MADE
A LOT OF MISTAKES IN MY LIFE,

448
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,897
SOME BAD DECISIONS,

449
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,565
YOU KNOW, BAD CHOICES.

450
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,364
BUT LUCY --
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER --

451
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,032
WAS NEVER ONE OF THEM.

452
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,330
THIS BAD CHOICE,
WHO I HADN'T SEEN IN TWO YEARS,

453
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,916
DECIDED TO CRASH
MY BIRTHDAY.

454
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,879
ARE YOU CRAZY?

455
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,548
YOU CANNOT BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

456
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,258
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

457
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:34,513
NO, MY SOCIAL WORKER'S GONNA
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

458
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,598
LOOK, I NEED TO BORROW
SOME MONEY.

459
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,393
IT'S NOT FOR DRUGS.

460
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,228
LOOK, I'M SERIOUS.

461
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,063
- YOU CANNOT BE HERE RIGHT NOW.
- I'M SERIOUS, OKAY?

462
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,566
I OWE THIS GUY MONEY YOU
DON'T WANT TO OWE MONEY TO.

463
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:49,236
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS!

464
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,904
LOOK, I'M IN TROUBLE.

465
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,700
( Knocking )

466
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,076
UH!

467
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,246
I'LL -- I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE!

468
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,625
PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER, OKAY?

469
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,962
AND IF YOU MESS WITH MY SOCIAL
WORKER, I WILL KILL YOU.

470
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,717
LUCY? LUCY, COME HERE.

471
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,260
COME HERE.
YOU OKAY?

472
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,595
( Knocking )

473
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:18,057
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

474
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,433
- HEY.
- HEY. HI.

475
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:20,893
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- OKAY.

476
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:24,605
WELL, COME ON IN.
WE'RE JUST, <i>UH...</i>

477
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,190
<i>WE'RE, UH...</i>

478
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,786
(door slams )

479
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:42,289
I HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER
TO SORT OF MONITOR...

480
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,291
MY ACTIONS WITH HER

481
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,628
BECAUSE IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN
AS REGULAR AND SAFE.

482
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,091
<i>SO...</i>

483
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:56,470
SHE CHECKS ON WHETHER
I'M BEING RESPONSIBLE

484
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,473
AND IF I AM
AN ADEQUATE MOTHER.

485
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,517
HERE YA GO.

486
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:09,316
I'M SORRY, SARAH, BUT I HAVE
TO REPORT THAT HE WAS HERE.

487
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,986
- BUT THEY MIGHT...
- I KNOW.

488
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,989
I'M SORRY, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP
THAT HE WAS WASTED.

489
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,951
I DIDN'T EVEN
LET HIM IN.

490
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,869
HE PUSHED HIS WAY IN,
I COULDN'T --

491
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,830
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WHEN I GOT HERE

492
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,125
HE WAS LESS THAN TEN FEET
FROM LUCY, HIGH AS A KITE.

493
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,961
JUST TELL ME
WHAT I CAN DO.

494
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:32,172
WELL, YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE
TO APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD

495
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,551
AND EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.

496
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:41,348
COULD THEY TAKE HER?

497
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,892
I DON'T KNOW.

498
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,019
THEY COULD, I GUESS.

499
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,355
I DON'T REALLY DEAL
WITH THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

500
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:53,193
ALL I'M SUPPOSED TO DO
IS OBSERVE AND REPORT.

501
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,033
IT'S LIKE
A WHOLE BATTLE NOW.

502
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,035
JUST MAKES EVERYTHING,

503
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,496
EVERYTHING, LIKE ME
PICKING UP THIS FORK,

504
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,373
IT MAKES EVERYTHING
MORE COMPLICATED.

505
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,083
MM-HMM.

506
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:17,092
AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S, YOU KNOW, MY BIRTHDAY.

507
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,558
WOW.

508
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,436
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

509
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,898
THAT YOU ACTUALLY TOLD HER
THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A GIRL

510
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,233
THAT LIKED TO GET DOWN
AND PARTY.

511
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,652
I COME HERE A LOT,
YOU KNOW.

512
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,572
READY THIS TIME?

513
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:42,201
AND NO OFFENSE, BUT NEITHER
OF YOU ARE MY TYPE.

514
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:45,537
YOU WANNA HEAR
THE SPECIALS?

515
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,955
YES, PLEASE.

516
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,897
SO, YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO WALK YOU HOME?

517
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,398
COULD BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS.

518
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,275
NO, STALKER...
YOU KNOW.

519
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,611
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

520
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,821
DAMN IT.

521
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:25,160
WHO, UH, WHO TAKES CARE OF
LUCY WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK?

522
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,330
MY MOM.

523
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,793
LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND
THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE.

524
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:39,508
I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE,
UM, WHAT THEY SAY, YOU KNOW?

ALL RIGHT, MY NAME
IS YVETTE MONTGOMERY.

605
00:41:56,515 --> 00:42:00,894
I WAS BORN FEBRUARY 6th,
1982, AT 10:34 P.M.

606
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:04,064
AT ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL,
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

607
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,066
SAME PLACE AS YOU.

608
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:09,903
UM, I'M MARRIED
WITH TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.

609
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:12,781
MY SON IS EIGHT
AND MY DAUGHTER IS SIX.

610
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,828
AND I WORK
THE OVERNIGHT SHIFT

611
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,415
AT A RESIDENTIAL YOUTH TREATMENT
CENTER FOR TROUBLED TEENS.

612

613
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,679
AFTER WORK,

614
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,890
I GET MY KIDS READY FOR SCHOOL
AND PACK THEIR LUNCHES

615
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,433
AND SEND THEM
ON THEIR WAY.

616
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,185
I SLEEP
WHILE THEY'RE AT SCHOOL

617
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,229
AND WAKE UP IN TIME
TO FIX DINNER.

618
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,398
THEN MY HUSBAND
USUALLY COMES HOME

619
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:49,192
EXHAUSTED
FROM A 10-HOUR SHIFT,

620
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:52,946
AND AFTER DINNER
I HEAD BACK TO WORK

621
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,615
AND START IT ALL OVER.

622
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,119

ON YOUR ACTUAL BIRTHDAY?

623
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,122

626
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:10,589
ISO NEEDED THIS.

627
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,924
GOT A SITTER
AND WENT OUT TO DINNER

628
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,759
WITH MY HUSBAND
BEFORE WORK.

629
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,136
TYRONE MISSED CALL.

630
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,096
I HAD TO GO
IN EARLY, THOUGH,

631
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,307
'CAUSE WE HAD
A KID MISS CURFEW.

632
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,641
I NEED TO GO
CHECK ON HIM, BABE.

633
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,143
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
HE GETS IN.

634
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,978
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- UH, I'LL CALL YOU, OKAY?

635
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:28,189
THE RESTAURANT WAS RIGHT DOWN
THE STREET FROM WHERE I WORK.

636
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,031
I WASN'T ORIGINALLY
SCHEDULED TO GO IN TILL 10:00.

637
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,082
OH, MY GOD!

638
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,917
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE HIM.

639
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,794

640
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,797

643
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,805

00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,307
(dispatch radio buzzes,

645
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,684
I WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE.

646
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,657
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

647
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:21,326
A BROKEN ARM
AND A SLIGHT CONCUSSION.

648
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,869
THE DOCTOR SAID
HE WAS LUCKY.

649
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,748
THIS IS MY STOP.

650
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:32,170
TRANSFER TO METRO TRAINS
AT LA SALLE AND VAN BUREN.

651
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,048

01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:25,603
UM, IT TURNS OUT

1220
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:29,648
I HAVE, UH, LYMPHOMA.

1221
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:46,123
AND, UH, THEY TOLD ME
THAT I CAN'T, UH,

1222
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:49,794
THAT THEY,
UH, THEY CAN'T, <i>UM...</i>

1223
01:24:49,794 --> 01:24:52,129
THERE'S <i>NO...</i>

1224
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:53,798
<i>SO, MAN, JAKE, UH...</i>

1225
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:55,174
(sniffles)

1226
01:24:55,174 --> 01:25:01,680
AH! JUST LIVE
LIKE YOU MEAN IT,

1227
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,183
'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW.

1228
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:11,524
SOAK UP ALL LIFE
HAS TO OFFER.

1229
01:25:11,524 --> 01:25:13,192
( Beep)

1230
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,156
I DON'T GET IT.

1231
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:23,119
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

1232
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:25,037
IF WE ALL HAVE
THE SAME HOROSCOPES

1233
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:28,874
AND HE'S DYING,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

1234
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,965
(door opens )

1235
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,811
INTERESTING TOPIC CHOICE,
BY THE WAY.

1236
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:52,565
YEAH, THANKS
FOR THE EXTENSION.

1237
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,316
WELL, DON'T THANK ME YET.

1238
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,819
YOU STILL NEED TO GET
AN "A" TO PASS THE COURSE.

1239
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:05,369
GOD. SON OF A BITCH.

1240
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:10,082
MM. HMM.

1241
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:17,840
SOMETIMES
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION IS

1242
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,801
TO FOLLOW THE PROBLEM
TO THE SOURCE.

1243
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:36,984
AH, I SEE YOU'RE A FAN
OF THE COMIC BOOK.

1244
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:41,780
GENTLER ON THE SOUL
THAN HEMINGWAY.

1245
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:48,245
A CHILD'S ABILITY
TO DREAM HAS NO BOUNDARY.

1246
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:51,332
IF WE LIMIT OUR CHOICES

1247
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:54,710
TO THAT
THAT ONLY SEEMS POSSIBLE

1248
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,380
OR TO WITHIN
SOCIETY'S VIEWPOINT

1249
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,926
OF WHAT IS REALITY OR REASON,

1250
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:04,845
WELL, THEN, THE ONLY DREAM LEFT

1251
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:08,974
IS A COMPROMISE.

1252
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:29,995
SO TRUE.

1253
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,708
SO.

1254
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,964
IS ASTROLOGY BULLSHIT?

1255
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:43,467
SEEMS LIKE
AN ETHICAL DILEMMA, NO?

1256
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:45,552
I GUESS LIKE
MOST THINGS IN LIFE

1257
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:49,098
IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT IT.

1258
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:51,433
RELATING TO ETHICS, OKAY?

1259
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:56,021
A KEY COMPONENT OF ETHICS
IS THE CORE BELIEF

1260
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:59,149
OF STRIVING
TO LIVE THE GOOD LIFE.

1261
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:02,528
OKAY, AND SO, HAVING
THESE TWO IDEAS,

1262
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:05,322
HAVING -- HAVING ASTROLOGY
AND ETHICS,

1263
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:10,119
JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE SHARE
THE SAME HOROSCOPES,

1264
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,787
WE CAN'T ASSUME
THAT THEY WOULD,

1265
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:15,082
THEY WOULD SHARE
THE SAME FATE.

1266
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:20,129
FATE IS NOT
A UNIVERSAL CONSTANT.

1267
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:22,840
FATE CAN BE CHANGED,
ALTERED.

1268
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,717
IF I COULD JUST GET YOU
TO SIGN RIGHT THERE.

1269
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:29,722
- HAVE A GOOD ONE.
- THANKS.

1270
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:32,266
I MEAN, IT IS HOW
WE RESPOND TO FATE,

1271
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:34,977
THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE
THAT DETERMINES WHO WE ARE.

1272
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,773
(chuckles )

1273
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,872
I LOST MY JOB,

1274
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:58,542
CAR, GIRLFRIEND,

1275
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:01,420
AND APARTMENT IN ONE DAY.

1276
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:06,175
YOU KNOW, BUT THEN,
HOW I RESPONDED TO THAT,

1277
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:07,926
MY CHOICES AFTER THAT,

1278
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,554
IT LED ME
TO SOMETHING THAT --

1279
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:14,475
SOMEONE
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.

1280
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,772
WHETHER YOU CALL IT
LOVE OR FAITH,

1281
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:22,775
AND WHATEVER
YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM IS,

1282
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:25,110
SITUATIONS OCCUR
IN OUR LIVES

1283
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,322
THAT ARE SOMETIMES
OUT OF OUR CONTROL.

1284
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:30,824
IT'S HOW WE DEAL
WITH THE ADVERSITY

1285
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:32,826
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

MAYBE THE QUESTION
SHOULD BE

1317
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:46,543
WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY?

1318
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,841
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE AFRAID TO ACCEPT

1319
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:56,553
RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE CONTROL
OUR OWN DESTINY.

1320
