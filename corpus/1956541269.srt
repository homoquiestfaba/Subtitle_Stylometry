¶ Dashing through the snow

10

¶ In a one-horse open sleigh

00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:54,085
¶ O'er the fields we go,

00:00:54,187 --> 00:01:01,426
¶ Bells on bobtails ring,

13

to laugh and sing ¶

14
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:09,667

¶ Oh jingle bells,

19
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:33,758
<i>Has anybody seen</i>
<i>the Christmas lights?</i>

20
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:35,092
Mom is calling you.

21
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:37,027
She can't find the
Christmas stuff.

22
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,530
Uh huh, whatever.

23
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,031
Is anyone even
listening to me?

24
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:41,065
No.

25
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,566
Eleanor!

26
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,503
We're having a holiday
party at school today.

27
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:46,637
Are you having one?

28
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,107
That's for kids.

29
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,009
We don't have those
parties in Jr. High.

30
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,880
How's that Santa coming?

31
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,615
The glue won't stick.

32
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:00,118
I like the ornaments
you made last year.

33
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,920
Did you find them yet?

34
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,454
Which ones did we
make last year?

35
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,824
The Popsicle
stick reindeer.

36
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,191
The Popsicle
stick reindeer.

37
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,393
Of course!

38
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:09,861
I don't know.

39
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,362
We'll ask mom, okay.

40
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,663
Are you girls
ready for school?

41
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,966
Only two more days and
Christmas vacation.

42
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,837
Good, after tomorrow I
can sleep in all day.

43
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,572
Eleanor, you
making an ornament?

44
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,340
No, it's stupid.

45
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:24,509
What?

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,843
How can this be?

47
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:29,079
I can't believe that you,
of all of my children,

48
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,883
are going to break the great
Ferguson family tradition,

49
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:34,819
with
no ornament!

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,721
<i>Why is there so</i>
<i>much laundry to do?</i>

51
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,023
What is it honey?

52
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:41,659
Have you seen this
pile of laundry Gary?

53
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,529
<i>Where are the</i>
<i>Christmas lights?</i>

54
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,497
We're the only house
on the whole block

55
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,332
without any up.

56
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,434
Sounds like
fun down there.

57
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,635
Coming.

58
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,339
Dinky lights,
pathetic tree...

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,310
another great
Ferguson tradition.

60
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,877
What do you care?

61
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,713
You said you didn't
believe in Santa anyway.

62
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:05,850
I don't, but I
believe in presents.

63
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,087
I don't know what
you did with them.

64
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:12,123
Of course, it's my fault.

65
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,325
<i>Mommy, Eleanor</i>
<i>[Unclear] Santa.</i>

66
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:15,693
-I did not!

67
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,329
Ho ho ho.

68
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:18,630
<i>Liv, finish</i>
<i>your breakfast.</i>

69
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,931
-You're not my mommy.

70
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,467
What are those, the inside of
the terminator?

71
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,835
No, it's our
Christmas lights.

72
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,303
Those are pretty Gary.

73
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:27,305
The Fergusons
will have lights.

74
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,573
Right.

75
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:31,075
It's all right, I
can untangle these.

76
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,745
Perfect...just in
time for Easter.

77
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,313
No, no, no.
I can handle it.

78
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:36,447
I just need to
find an end.

79
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:37,948
-Mommy, Elly's being mean.

80
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:38,983
-Don't call me Elly,
my name is Eleanor.

81
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:39,917
I might make it work.

82
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,886
Why don't we just
buy new ones?

83
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:44,889
Oh that's right, we
can't afford new ones.

84
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,157
We've maxed out
four credit cards.

85
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,093
What do you want me to do?

86
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,796
It would just be nice if
maybe you could paid

87
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,398
for some of that work you did.

88
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:58,369
Oh, oh, see these huh.

89
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,604
Tada!

90
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:04,308
Wow.

91
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,479
Okay. I'll admit it; it's
going to be a lean Christmas.

92
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,915
Do you have any
work lined up Gary?

93
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,784
Well, I finished
a plumbing job

94
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,486
on the Larrys yesterday, so
I'll send an invoice out today.

95
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,288
Great, and do you think that
maybe sometime this year

96
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,090
you could fix the
downstairs toilet,

97
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,058
because it still
doesn't work.

98
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,162
Look, I've got a few leads
on some things okay.

99
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:25,597
Something's
going to come up.

100
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,332
Something always comes up.

101
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,967
And what about
if it doesn't?

102
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:33,538
<i>You know you can't pay</i>
<i>bills with optimism Gary.</i>

103
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,473
Four days till Christmas.

104
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:36,941
Four days.

105
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,410
I can't buy anything
and we need everything.

106
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,714
<i>Mommy, we're</i>
<i>going to be late.</i>

107
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,884
Oh, what about this?

108
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,853
Wail till you see.

109
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,454
It's going to
be beautiful.

110
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,293
We don't even
have a tree Gary.

111
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:56,460
I know.

112
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,769
Perfect.

113
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,838
Perfect, I mean what
else could go wrong?

114
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,108
You know what,
don't worry?

115
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,910
Don't worry.

116
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,179
It's going to be
a great Christmas.

117
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,982
I'm going to get a
tree, I promise you.

118
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,151
From where, the park?

119
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:21,185
Yes, the park.

120
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,620
That's a great idea.

121
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:26,257
<i>Mom, I have a test...</i>

122
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,225
I'm going to take
the kids to school.

123
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,294
<i>I can't be late; it's</i>
<i>the end of the semester.</i>

124
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,604
Come on Eleanor!

125
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:40,972
Where's Mom?

126
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,173
I'm giving her a break.

127
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,641
Get in.

128
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,877
I'll walk.

129
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,945
Olivia!

130
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:49,980
Olivia, you forgot
your cookies.

131
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:52,316
We stayed up so
late making these.

132
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,518
And you left them
on the table.

133
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:54,786
Silly goose.

134
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,354
-Oops.
-Oops.

135
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,589
Eleanor, where
are you going?

136
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,124
Where do you think?

137
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:04,662
(Sigh)

138
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,698
Mommy, are we going
to have a Christmas tree?

139
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,799
Baby, ask your dad.

140
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:11,102
Absolutely.

141
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,803
It might not have
any branches...

142
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,405
No branches?

143
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,340
Where will we hang
our ornaments?

144
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:19,144
Do you remember that old
cartoon I showed you?

145
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,413
Well we will wrap the
tree in your blanket

146
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:25,150
and it will grow to a
full-size Christmas tree.

147
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,918
Like magic?

148
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:29,420
Christmas is the most
magic time of the year.

149
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,055
It's when wishes
come true.

150
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:34,292
Right honey?

151
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:35,693
Have fun at your
party, okay.

152
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:37,061
Okay.

153
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:38,929
And eat lunch before you
go eating all the cookies.

154
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,631
Okay Mommy.

155
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,767
Oh, I didn't finish
my Santa yet.

156
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:44,368
Can I finish it
when I get home?

157
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,970
Yes, of course you can.

158
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:49,373
Beautiful day!

159
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:50,708
[engine starts]

160
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:04,488
Eleanor?

161
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:05,623
Eleanor?

162
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,292
Get in the car,
it's cold.

163
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,293
Daddy, does Eleanor
hate Christmas?

164
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,995
No, no, of course not!

165
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,064
Does Mom hate Christmas?

166
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,232
No baby; nobody
hates Christmas.

167
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,534
Eleanor, get
in the car now!

168
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:22,574
Mom hates Christmas.

169
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,841
It always puts
her in a bad mood.

170
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,683
Thank you Eleanor, welcome
to the Ferguson carpool.

171
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:55,373

172

[Music]

174
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,959
Oh, Olivia,
Olivia, Olivia.

175
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,261
(Phone Rings)

176
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:18,796
Oh, you didn't
get the payment?

177
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,430
<i>No ma'am we didn't.</i>

178
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:21,732
<i>We are going to need</i>
<i>that payment right away.</i>

179
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,835
Okay, well, I'm going
to put it on my card.

180
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,403
You didn't get
the payment?

181
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,771
<i>No, I'm sorry we didn't.</i>

182
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,472
Yeah, I sent it.

183
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:29,973
<i>Well, I have no record</i>
<i>of it here ma'am.</i>

184
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,708
Could you just look over
the bill again, because,

185
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,644
I think there's a mistake.

186
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,046
I guess I just
misplaced the bill.

187
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,347
I don't know...

188
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,615
<i>Well the late fee ...</i>

189
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:39,183
Yeah, I'm usually so
good about these things.

190
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:42,753
I was wondering if you
could waive that late fee?

191
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:45,489
You know, I'm hardly ever
late...we're never late.

192
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,690
This is the first time.

193
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,059
I sent the payment.

194
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,427
I have no idea...right.

195
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,396
You know, I just
pay half...well;

196
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:54,031
I could pay you
half of that now.

197
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,366
Full minimum payment.

198
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,568
Full minimum payment.
Full minimum payment.

199
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,603
The check's in the mail.

200
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:00,671
Thanks.

I'm here, Sheila...

Come on, I don't
have that much time.

207
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,014
Can I help you?

208
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,383
Were you interested in
something in the window?

209
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:03,354
Yeah, the red dress.
How much?

210
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,655
$1200.

211
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:05,856
Plus tax?

212
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:07,458
Mhm. Would you like
to try it on?

213
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,595
Uh, oh yes!

214
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,962
Well I'll grab
one for you.

I thought
that was you!

218
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,927
Nick, hi.
Yeah, it's me.

219
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,061
Great.

220
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:18,028
Wow, what a surprise!

221
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,330
Yeah.

222
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,499
So, I mean, you're
back in town.

223
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,367
Well I guess I couldn't
stay in Nice forever,

224
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,201
could I?

225
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:27,071
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:30,007
Ah, yeah, shopping.

227
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,076
How long has it been since
we've seen each other?

228
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,243
-Four years?
-Five.

229
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,579
Five.

230
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,113
Your father's memorial.

231
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,418
Yeah.

232
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,089
You still painting?

233
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,125
Oh yeah.

234
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,562
Hi.

235
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:52,763
You remember
Paula don't you?

236
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,165
We went to
school together.

237
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,367
She used to work for
my father's gallery.

238
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,501
Of course. Hello.

239
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:58,969
Hi.

240
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,904
Honey, I need the AMEX.

241
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,177
So how's Gary?

242
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,478
Oh, great.

243
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,213
Still doing construction.

244
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:10,981
Have you been to
my gallery lately?

245
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,215
No, no.

246
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:13,950
Not in a long time.

247
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,052
Oh, you should see the
lineup of new artists

248
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,620
I've discovered.

249
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,890
Wow.

250
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,023
Are you still
doing florals?

251
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,526
Yeah, all the time.

252
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:23,627
Well then, you've
got to come.

253
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,028
You'll love the new show.

254
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,397
Honey, we're late.

255
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,865
I'm inviting Paula
to the opening.

256
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,199
[both]
What?

257
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,101
The new show
opens tonight.

258
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:33,137
You and Gary should come.

259
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,538
Really?

260
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,139
Yeah, 8 o'clock tonight.

261
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,176
That dress will
look great on you.

262
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,085
I gotta go.

263
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,720
But, um, thank you.

264
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,789
It's really
good to see you.

265
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,231
Are you going to
take any of those?

266
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,332
You know, I'm going
to think about it

267
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,768
and maybe I'll
be back tomorrow.

268
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,436
I'll look forward to
seeing you there.

I have nothing to wear.

271
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,964
Honey, you look
good in nothing.

272
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:36,333
I mean whatever you wear;
you're going to look great.

273
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,768
I have nothing
good enough.

274
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,070
Well what about the
lime green pant suit

275
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,037
my mom gave you for
Christmas last year?

276
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,273
Okay, forget that I
even offered that.

277
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:45,509
Why are we even
going to this?

278
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,378
What? What are you
talking about now?

279
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,947
Well you don't even have to
go to this gallery thing.

280
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:52,516
We never go anywhere
Gary and this is free.

281
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,384

can afford, right?

I hope Santa brings
me a pretty dress.

288

Yeah, have him
bring me one too.

you like my Santa?

such a good job!

have this dance?

forgot to sew it!

even see it.

Gary!

319
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:40,958
There's going to be women
in there whose dresses

320

cost over $1200.

321
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,428
plus tax.

322
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,198
Mine was at the Goodwill
and it has a pin in it.

323
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,399
You can barely even see
it, I'm telling you.

324
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,601
It looks great.

325

...nobody does Aspen
on Christmas day.

329

Oh Aspen's done.

Everyone goes
to Telluride.

331

Completely out of date.

332
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,613
Gary, can you not push me?

333
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:38,615
Do you see anyone else
pushing their wife?

334
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,551
Gary! Paula!

335
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,187
Oh great, the
old flame Janine!

336
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,388
Come on, I like Janine.

337
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:46,657
Well then, you
talk to her.

338
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:48,958
Hi guys.

339
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,194
Hi.

340
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,461
Can you believe
this place?

341
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,697
-It's amazing.
-It's pretty great.

342
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,399
How are you Gary?

343
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,702
Not bad. Not bad.

344
00:18:58,803 --> 00:18:59,837
Where's Nick?

345
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,139
Over by the window;

346
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,773
he's the one surrounded
by all the girls -

347
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,842
the same as
high school.

348
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,546
Well, go on and say hi.

349
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,316
We'll just stay here
and discuss painting.

350
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,550
House painting.

351
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,686
Good, have fun.

352
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,087
Thank you.

353
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:23,093
I bet Nick can't
paint a house.

354
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:25,696
I bet he doesn't do
copper plumbing either.

355

[chatter throughout]

356
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:43,914
Paula.

357
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:45,082
Nick.

358
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,449
Oh, I didn't even see you.

359
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,584
You made it.

360
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,420
Is Gary here?

361
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,721
Yeah, he's over there.

362
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,491
I want to show
you something;

363
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:55,725
I'm so glad you came.

364
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,096
Hello.

365
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,798
-Hi sweetie.
-How are you?

366
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:01,999
Hello, gorgeous.

367
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:05,735
You look lovely,
both of you.

368
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,970
Great work.

369
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,675
Have to tell you, it really
feels great to be back.

370
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,385
So what do you
think of this?

371
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,987
Very modern.

372
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,523
What is it?

373
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:27,757
Garbage.

374
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:30,260
(Laughs)

375
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,062
How you been?

376
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:36,567
Good.

377
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,670
Gosh it must be so nice
to travel around Europe,

378
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,105
buying art.

379
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,841
Well, I've missed people.

380
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,309
You're surrounded
by people.

381
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,777
Not friends.

382
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:56,253
I was dating this guy
last year but it fizzled,

383
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,188
he didn't
want kids.

384
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,790
Well, you know what;
you'll find someone

385
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,024
because you're
a good person.

386
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,431
So what are you doing to
keep yourself busy these days?

387
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:09,800
Life.

388
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,635
I've two girls, so
there is always,

389
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:13,603
always something.

390
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:16,773
Yeah.
Kids are great.

391
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,241
I never went
down that road.

392
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,275
No?

393
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,077
Yeah, god,
they're your life.

394
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:42,399
Would you be interested in
working in a Art Gallery again?

395
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,134
You mean like
working here?

396
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:46,169
Sh, our secret.

397
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,270
Hi.

398
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:48,872
Sheila, hi.

399
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,207
Nice to see you again.

400
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,274
You too.

401
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,645
Wow, that's a
fantastic skirt.

402
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,380
Honey, Malcolm and Shanite
would like to talk to you

403
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,448
about the large
piece from Florence.

404
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,283
Mr. and Mrs. Kensington,
photo please?

405
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,791
Good night.
Nice seeing you Paula.

406
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:11,828
Nice skirt...

407
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:15,732
I know.

408
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,901
Hey, I'm done.

409
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:19,135
I'm done.
I'm ready to go.

410
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:20,371
Okay, hang on.

411
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,538
I'm going to go say
goodbye to Nick.

412
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,073
Why?

413
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:25,142
Well, because I didn't get
a chance to say hello.

414
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,615
Which piece did you like?

415
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:36,086
Excuse me, just a second.

416
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,322
You know how
lucky you were?

417
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,125
What?

418
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,526
Dating both of them
in high school?

419
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,128
Yeah.

420
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,831
You ended up with the
right guy though.

421
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,300
I bet Gary's a great dad.

422
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:52,002
Yeah, he is.

423
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:59,843
[indistinct chatter]

424
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,953
Did you enjoy
the party?

425
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:13,523
How's Janine?

426
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:15,592
Maybe I should have
taken her to Prom.

427
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,304
What are you doing?

428
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:32,342
[radio playing quietly]

429
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,153
What was dad
drinking last night?

430
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,422
Once we put our
ornaments on it,

431
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,558
the tree will look great.

432
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,859
That's not a tree,
that's a branch.

433
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,961
Admiring our Christmas
branch girls?

434
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,000
All right,
let's go ladies.

435

Christmas vacation.

436

-Hey.

<i>I got the lights.</i>

442
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,045
Yeah, do you mind dropping
the girls off a school?

443
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:09,946
I'll meet you
at the sight.

444
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,081
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

445
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,216
Come on guys.

Back-packs, back-packs.

447
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:14,918
Let's go.

448
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,252
Love you daddy.

449
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:17,354
All right, have
a good day.

450
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,722
-Bye dad.
-Thank you.

451

How about you
sweetheart?

452
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:25,361
Me?

453
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:27,564
Oh, I was booking
a flight to France,

Oh, Armando?

Enjoy yourself.

I have a very hard
working husband, don't I?

00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,406
Si.

At the Club.

574
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:52,655
The Club.

575
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:53,989
-Yes.
-Which Club?

576
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,358
The Montclair.

00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:56,759
Oh, oh.

00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:57,927
The one up on the hill?

Yes.

00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:00,630
Yeah, I knew that.

Yes, I'm here for my

To the Club as usual.

Honey!

Who cut your hair last?

00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:36,199
Who did this to you?

593
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,500
Have you been
cheating on Armando?

594
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,502
Yes.

595
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:41,471
Please take pity
on my hair Armando.

596
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,640
What do you want
me to do with this?

597
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,141
I know, I know, up.

598
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:46,342
Up and big.

599
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:47,643
Big.

600
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:50,847
We need, blonder, we need
bigger, we need sexy!

601
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,014
Who's a bad girl?

602
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:53,081
Who's a sexual kitten?

603
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:53,849
Me!

604
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,217
Yes! Scissors!

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,853
-Ready?
-Yeah.

masterpiece by Armando.

607
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,495

609
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:14,537
Paula, over here?

610
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,777
Wow, what have you
done to your hair?

611
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,648
Don't you love it?

612
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:31,487
We're talking about what
to do for New Years.

613
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:33,489
Didn't you and Nick
ski Aspen last winter?

614
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,957
Oh, I'm sure we did.

615
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:36,626
I don't you remember you
staying in the condo.

616
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,027
Maybe we stayed
in a hotel.

617
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:39,395
You wouldn't
stay in a hotel,

618
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:41,463
because you have a condo
right next to Liz.

619
00:36:41,564 --> 00:36:42,932
-Who's Liz?
-I am.

620
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,867
Right. That Liz.

621
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,803
Are you okay?

622
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,008
We here Nick has
a new publicist.

623
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,543
I think he
needed a new one.

624
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:54,743
Quite attractive I hear.

625
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,112
I hear she's brilliant
with the press.

626
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:57,279
Is she invited
to your party?

627
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,480
My party?

628
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:00,716
Christmas Eve party.

629
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:03,119
Wow, god, you know
I completely forgot

630
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,453
about that party.

631
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:05,888
I'm just going to
have to talk to Martina

632
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,290
and we'll throw
something together.

633
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,257
Oh right.

634
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:09,491
So, what are you wearing?

635
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:13,829
Mm...the red dress.

636
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,232
(Laughter)
Yes!

637
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,778
Mrs. Kensington, it's so
good to see you again.

638
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:33,983
Yes, well, it's the dream
dress...for a dream.

639
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:34,984
$1,200.

640
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,919
I know, plus tax.

641
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,721
Wrap it up please.

642
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:39,822
And would you like to
see the night gowns

643
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:40,923
we just got in from Paris?

644
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:42,024
Just came in this morning.

645
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,459
Just to tempt you.

646
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,427
How much?

647
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:45,661
$800 each.

648
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:49,265
$800 for a nightgown?

649
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:50,699
From Paris.

650
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,336
Right, a steal.

651
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,671
Why don't I just fly the
Paris and pick up a few.

652
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:56,739
You could.

653
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,877
Yes, yes I could.

654
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,545
We are going to
fly to Paris.

655
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:04,413
It will be the perfect
Christmas gift.

656
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:07,883
London, Paris, Rome.

657
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,752

658
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:12,654
Where are we going?

659
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:14,123
Oh yes, yes, yes.

660
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:15,925
Maybe something tropical.

661
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:18,327
Tropical or romantic.

662
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:19,928
Tropical/romantic,
tropical/romantic.

663
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:26,803

664
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,437
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

665
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:32,141
Hello, Mrs. Kensington?

666
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:34,977
Oh hi, I'm just
here to see Nick.

667
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:37,713
Mr. Kensington is busy;
he's in a private meeting.

668
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:40,149
Oh, who with?

669
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,618
He's doing press packets.

670
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,322
Oh, well did he say
how long he would be?

671
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:47,723
He didn't say.

672
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:53,362
(Knock on door)

673
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:54,897
Nick?

674
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,533
Hi.

675
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:58,801
I told her you
<i>were busy.</i>

676
00:38:58,902 --> 00:38:59,835
I'm in the middle of
something here Paula.

677
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:01,437
What would you like?

678
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:02,871
Oh, I just wanted to
ask you something.

679
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:04,440
Ask me?

680
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,376
It was kind of a
personal matter.

681
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:09,445
Can this wait until later?

682
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,481
Sure.

683
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,882
Yeah, of course.

684
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,251
Oh, hey, where do you want
to have dinner tonight?

685
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,453
Ahh...
Dinner?

686
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:19,354
I'll be home
at 7 o'clock.

687
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:22,024
Okay, I'll have Martina make
up something special, huh?

688
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,527
Don't go out of your way
to do anything special.

689
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,195
Roxanne...

690
00:39:26,296 --> 00:39:27,362
No more
interruptions.

691
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:34,136
Boy he could really
use a vacation huh?

692
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:35,972
Which do you think
he would prefer -

693
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:39,041
a tour of Europe, or a
Mediterranean cruise?

694
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:40,977
He hates the water.

695
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,378
Right, right.

696
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,914
Well, Europe is still lovely
this time of year, right?

697
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,058
I'm back.

698
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,726
Talk about shop
until you drop,

699
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:58,627
I'll tell
you what...

700
00:39:58,728 --> 00:39:59,862
and you know,

701
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:02,431
I used every single
credit card in my purse.

702
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:03,933
Gosh, wait till you
see what I'm wearing

703
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,368
to dinner tonight.

704
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,802
Oh, where are you going?

705
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:08,404
We're dining in tonight.

706
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:09,605
Who is?

707
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:11,107
Nick and I.

708
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,508
So could you make
something sexy?

709
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:14,710
I have only
frozen fish.

710
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,445
Okay, well fish
can be sexy.

711
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,514
Fish with a little
something on it.

712
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:19,748
Something sexy?

713
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,650
Yeah.

714
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,287
[speaking Spanish]

715
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:26,922
Okay.

716
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:29,158
And we are having a
party on Christmas eve,

717
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:32,294
so we are really going to
have to talk about the food.

718
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:33,896
What food?

719
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:35,897
It's catered.

720
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,499
-It's catered?
-Yeah.

721
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,235
I am in heaven.

722
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:42,939
Well I will be up
in my bathroom

723
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:45,641
having a luxurious Jacuzzi.

00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,416
[laughs]

728
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:56,752
I love Paris...

729
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:59,155
when it drizzles.

730
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,357
That's how it happens...

731
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:05,027
...one day the mind,
she's gone.

732
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,898
And I'm going to love
<i>Paris in the summer</i>

733
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,733
when it's sizzles!

734
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:14,203
Hey Martina, guess who
bought two tickets

735
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:17,907
to Paris -
where it sizzles?

736
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,786
Who needs this
many lights?

737
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,588
Nick Kensington does.

738
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:35,090
Didn't he marry
your old girlfriend?

739
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:37,626
Just keep doing what
you're doing Reg.

740
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:42,464
I see you're over her turning
you down for the prom.

741
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,666
Haven't you got some
lights to hang?

742
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,303
I will come down
off this ladder.

743
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,138
Easy big fella.

744
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:00,783
Gary?

745
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:04,019
Gary?

746
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,521
What are you doing here?

747
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:07,356
Hi Paula, Nick hired me to
put up the Christmas lights.

748
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:08,590
How are you?

749
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:11,894
-Good.
-Good.

750
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:14,796
So, we haven't seen
each other since...

751
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:15,864
...since the gallery opening.

752
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,233
Oh right.

753
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:19,402
Yeah, Janine and I
had a great time.

754
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,402
Thank you.

755
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:22,271
Oh right.

756
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:24,406
Oh, so you would
be with Janine?

757
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,409
Well yeah, since
after high school.

758
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,544
We...

759
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,214
How are your kids?

760
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,248
You have kids right?

761
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:34,417
Yeah, two girls.

762
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:36,018
Eleanor and Olivia.

763
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,152
Yeah.

764
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:38,321
Have you met them?

765
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,528
Okay, Gary was here.

766
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,829
Why?

767
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:51,000
Why, why, why, why would
I put Gary in my dream?

768
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:55,136
And how long do
dreams last exactly?

769
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:56,772
And why am I
talking to myself?

770
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:04,847
Do you think I have
too much jewelry on?

771
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:06,248
If you were a float
in a parade no,

772
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:08,751
but for a person, yes.

773
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,020
What time does Nick...

774
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,389
Mr. Kensington, usually
get home from work?

775
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,259
Oh Mr. K, he's often late.

776
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,795
He probably has lots to
do at the office, huh?

777
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:21,697
Recently, yes.

778
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:29,638
Mr. Kensington,

779
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,540
it's almost 7,
I'm leaving.

780
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:33,375
I got more
Christmas shopping.

781
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,845
It's okay,
I'll lock up.

782
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:38,079
Good night Roxanne.

783
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:39,181
<i>Good night.</i>

784
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:45,087
Don't you have some
shopping to do?

785
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:47,155
I have everything I want
for Christmas right here.

786
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,760
Yes you do.

787
00:43:55,098 --> 00:44:00,502
[music playing]

788
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:01,871
You know I'm thinking

789
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,406
maybe he stopped off
for some champagne.

790
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:04,673
Uh huh...

791
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:06,575
Or maybe even flowers.

792
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:08,110
Okay.

793
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:10,713
Hey, I am not drinking
by myself anymore,

794
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,913
so I am pouring
you a glass.

795
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:13,214
No thank you.

796
00:44:13,316 --> 00:44:14,684
Oh, I insist.

797
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,118
What shall we 'cheers' to?

798
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,820
To new beginnings
at Christmas.

799
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:20,355
Are you having
a new beginning?

800
00:44:20,456 --> 00:44:22,291
Yes.

801
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:24,459
I better go and
check the sexy fish.

802
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,427
No wait, wait, wait.

803
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,363
It's my turn.

804
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,131
We're going to 'cheers'.

805
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,701
To new beginnings
at Christmas time.

806
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:34,503
Did I tell you I feel like
I'm on my first date?

807
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:37,405
Yes, many times, and your
first date is very late.

808
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:39,174
Yes, well he was
at the office

809
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,276
meeting with his
new publicist;

810
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:43,011
they seem to be getting
along very well.

811
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:45,347
He gets along with women.

812
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:49,485
I wonder why we
never had kids?

813
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,754
Do you ever wonder
why we never had kids?

814
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,222
No I didn't.

815
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,690
And I'm going to check
the fish, I think,

816
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,325
now it's not so sexy.

817
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,560
Oh wait, what song
should I put on?

818
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:00,162
What do Nick and I
usually dance to?

819
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,497
He doesn't dance.

820
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:03,065
-He doesn't?
-No.

821
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,667
Yeah, you know,
he never danced

822
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,402
in high school either.

823
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,637
Now you're seeing
the problems.

824
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:11,073
[door opens]

825
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:12,741
Uh-oh.

826
00:45:13,943 --> 00:45:15,077
Dinner ready?

827
00:45:15,178 --> 00:45:18,279
Well hello there stranger!

828
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:20,248
Turn off that noise.

829
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:21,250
Well, I thought we'd
do a little samba

830
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,751
before dinner.

831
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:24,119
What are you
talking about?

832
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,921
I just finished
a long day.

833
00:45:26,022 --> 00:45:27,389
And those damn photos
didn't turn out

834
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,824
for the press packet.

835
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:31,793
I'm sorry, but you know
samba can be relaxing.

836
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,695
Come on, I'll teach you.

837
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:34,630
What are you doing?

838
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:35,798
We don't dance.

839
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,200
Loosen up Nick, come
on, give it a shot.

840
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:40,436
Come on, it'll be fun.

841
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,204
How much wine
have you had?

842
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:44,806
Just a couple of glasses.

843
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:49,278
Why did you stop by today?

844
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,546
Sit down first.

845
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:57,252
I got you an early
Christmas gift.

846
00:45:57,353 --> 00:45:58,387
We've already
given each other

847
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:00,289
our Christmas
presents Paula.

848
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,558
Well this is extra.

849
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,692
What is it?

850
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:06,861
Well, you sir
work way too hard,

851
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:09,665
and we need a vacation.

852
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:19,575
I'm starting to feel
very awkward here Paula.

853
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:22,110
Your dress,
the dancing...

854
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,778
what are you doing?

855
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,214
Paris.

856
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:28,584
Two tickets; you and moi.

857
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,821
Hotel, spa, museums,
art shows...

858
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:34,256
We're not going
to Paris Paula.

859
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:38,660
Okay. It doesn't
have to be Paris.

860
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,495
We could go to Zurich.

861
00:46:40,596 --> 00:46:41,796
What are you
talking about?

862
00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:43,265
What do you mean?

863
00:46:43,366 --> 00:46:45,000
We're getting a divorce.

864
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:46,401
A divorce?

865
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,437
We're not going anywhere
together, ever again.

866
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:51,439
That doesn't make sense.

867
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,642
We're having a catered
party on Christmas Eve.

868
00:46:53,743 --> 00:46:55,377
Well, the divorce
is your idea;

869
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:57,846
come to think of it,
so is the party.

870
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,117
My idea?

871
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:04,686
Is this some ploy to
re-negotiate the settlement?

872
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:06,254
Everything is signed.

873
00:47:06,355 --> 00:47:08,456
Paperwork goes through
midnight Christmas Eve.

874
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:09,657
Midnight?

875
00:47:09,758 --> 00:47:11,926
That's when the sweet
table comes out.

876
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:16,398
You never could finish
anything could you?

877
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,667
The riding lessons;
cooking classes;

878
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:21,737
your attempt at art.

879
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,705
Well, I'm finishing
this one for you;

880
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,674
we're over, as is
this conversation.

881
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:39,288
[soft music]

882
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:56,972
[sigh]

883
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,515
I need to talk to Nick.

884
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:09,551
Are you kidding me?

885
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:10,919
You asked for this
divorce a year ago.

886
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,955
I don't want this now.

887
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,657
Well, it's a little
late for that.

888
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,261
Please, can't we just
try to work this out?

889
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:21,296
Maybe you should
see Dr. Degolia,

890
00:48:21,397 --> 00:48:22,998
and have him adjust your
prescription again.

891
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,002
No, I don't need a
prescription Nick.

892
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,305
I need you.

893
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:33,374
After $100,000
in legal fees?

894
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:36,178
I don't want to have this
conversation with you anymore.

895
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:37,746
Understand?

896
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:38,814
Well Nick, maybe
there's something

897
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,382
we haven't tried.

898
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:41,483
How about counseling.

899
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,518
We spent three years
with Dr. Marson.

900
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,020
But we have everything we
need to make ourselves

901
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:46,254
perfectly happy.

902
00:48:46,355 --> 00:48:47,689
It doesn't even
make sense.

903
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,458
That's what I
thought a year ago,

904
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,861
but apparently I
made you miserable.

905
00:48:52,962 --> 00:48:57,332
Nick, I don't want us...
this life to just end.

906
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,569
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

907
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,771
You still don't
care about me.

908
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:03,939
You know I didn't
hear you say, Nick,

909
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,941
I realized I made a
big mistake, or Nick,

910
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,576
I've always loved you,

911
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:09,544
I'll try to be
a better wife.

912
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,646
All you care about is
having an expense account.

913
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,116
Anyway...

914
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,252
...it doesn't
matter anymore.

915
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:18,954

916
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:21,056
I'm moving on
with my life,

917
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:23,758
you should too.

918
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:25,660
At my age I'd
like the chance

919
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:27,695
to be with someone
who loves me.

920
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,201
Like Sheila.

921
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:37,840
Sheila loves me for who I
am, not what I can give.

922
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,576
You know back in
high school Nick,

923
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:44,245
I dated Gary Ferguson too.

924
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:46,781
Did you know that?

925
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,950
And I could have gone to the
prom with either one of you,

926
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:54,489
but in this life
I chose you.

927
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,824
And your point is?

928
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:58,893
That I chose you!

929

933
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:14,643
I'm sorry.

934
00:50:15,945 --> 00:50:16,945
It's okay.

935
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:18,614
We're done.

go home now, okay?

937

we're not getting back

I can't get back.

952

I can't get back and I've
made a terrible mistake.

Oh, good, good.

You'll tell me if the
reindeer are all crooked.

any crooked reindeer.

about the reindeer.

No, it looks great.

00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:27,942
I mean, I think the middle
one looks like it's ready

00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:31,045
Is that Dasher or Donner,

1025
00:57:31,146 --> 00:57:32,747
because usually I have
trouble with Blitzen.

straighten the reindeer.

all these lights

me a club sandwich,

club I'm gonna taste today.

1044
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:17,458

could be a really good time

1045
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:19,059

some catching up.

gonna hang with Reg.

1050
00:58:34,209 --> 00:58:36,811
Gary, don't you remember
when you used to pick me up

1051

have lunch at the Bluffs?

1052

remember that.

1055
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:52,459
I could be back and pick
you up around noon.

00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:56,163
Uh, noon.

1057
00:58:56,264 --> 00:58:57,265

I'm going to have.

Yeah, sort of.

1086
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,940
-Go fish.

1087
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,009
-Whoa, I have 5 aces.

1088
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,677
-It's not an ace,
it's the joker.

1089
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:58,512
-Okay, I'll take it back.

1090
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,721
<i>-Daddy says the joker mild.</i>

1091
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:09,257
<i>-That's wild, but</i>
<i>not in this game.</i>

1092
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,292
You have such
a lovely tree.

1093
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:12,760
Your turn.

1094
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:15,763
Gary probably picked it up
off the side of the road.

1095
01:02:15,864 --> 01:02:17,064
He's so creative
that way.

1096
01:02:17,165 --> 01:02:20,701
But the kids don't care,

1097
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:24,371
they're just excited
Santa's coming!

1098
01:02:24,472 --> 01:02:26,007
Right girls?

1099
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,878
-Too men.
-Those are jacks.

1100
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:32,213
Hi girls.

1101
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:35,683
Say hello to Mrs.
Kensington girls.

1102
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:37,551
-Hi.
-Whatever.

1103
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:40,688
<i>-They're mine.</i>

1104
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,290
<i>-Okay, go fish.</i>

1105
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,424
<i>-I just did.</i>

1106
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:47,829
Thanks.

1107
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:52,700
Wat--
Oh!

1108
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:55,537
Watch up for the pool of
ketchup next to your arm.

1109
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,639
[phone rings]

1110
01:02:57,739 --> 01:02:59,506
Mom, if that's Cody
<i>I'm not home.</i>

1111
01:02:59,607 --> 01:03:02,176
Hello, Ferguson
Construction here.

1112
01:03:02,277 --> 01:03:04,478
<i>Ma'am our records indicate</i>
<i>you're way past due.</i>

1113
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,247
Honey, if we
could pay you,

1114
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:07,948
we would pay
everyone else too.

1115
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,017
<i>Unacceptable...</i>

1116
01:03:10,118 --> 01:03:11,852
Well, Merry
Christmas to you too.

1117
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:15,823
Could I use the bathroom?

1118
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,659
Sure, you'll have to use the
kid's bathroom upstairs,

1119
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,262
the toilet down here is
having plumbing issues.

1120
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,498
It's broken?

1121
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,866
Of course it is.

1122
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:27,502
<i>Okay go fish.</i>

1123
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:41,482
Are you looking
for the bathroom?

1124
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:42,983
OH! Oh my god.

1125
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:44,118
I didn't mean
to scare you.

1126
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:45,319
It's okay.

1127
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,353
Janine told me that
you have something

1128
01:03:46,454 --> 01:03:48,188
to talk to me about.

1129
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:49,790
Yeah, I do.

1130
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,026
Okay, shoot.

1131
01:03:52,127 --> 01:03:55,729
Oh, I'm not quite sure
how to say this thing.

1132
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:57,898
What is it?

1133
01:04:00,435 --> 01:04:02,136
I miss you Gary.

1134
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:04,505
I miss our
life together.

1135
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,642
<i>Our</i> life together?

1136
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,009
Gary?

1137
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,778
Do you want your
white shirt for tonight?

1138
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:12,780
Sure.

1139
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:18,018
Paula, that was
ancient history.

1140
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:19,354
That was high school.

1141
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,022
No, not really.

1142
01:04:22,557 --> 01:04:24,492
Are you guys going out?

1143
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:26,694
Oh yeah, Janine and
I like to go dancing.

1144
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:29,430
You know,

1145
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:31,532
you used to
like to dance.

1146
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:32,933
I still do.

1147
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:34,002
Well, you
know what,

1148
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:35,403
you should Nick on
the dance floor.

1149
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:37,705
We go to this great local
place just down the road.

1150
01:04:37,806 --> 01:04:39,106
In fact, I gotta
get changed,

1151
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,208
otherwise Janine's gonna
hit me with a wooden spoon.

1152
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,509
Gary, I just want you to--

1153
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:46,447
I'm sorry.

1154
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:47,748
I just want you to know

1155
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:50,251
that I think you're
incredibly handy.

1156
01:04:51,586 --> 01:04:54,021
Nick, he's not so handy.

1157
01:04:54,122 --> 01:04:56,757
Well, Nick has his
talents and I have mine,

1158
01:04:56,858 --> 01:04:58,359
so if you need
anything fixed,

1159
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,994
I'll be right over
in a heartbeat.

1160
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,130
Did you ever wonder
what it would be like

1161
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,199
if you married
somebody else?

1162
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:07,668
Like who?

1163
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:08,936
Like me?

1164
01:05:09,037 --> 01:05:11,572
Like you and me?

1165
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,308
<i>Don't you feel</i>
<i>anything for me?</i>

1166
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,279
Well, Paula, I know
about the divorce,

1167
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,014
and I'm really sorry

1168
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:21,982
that you couldn't work
things out with Nick.

1169
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:26,154
This is so weird, here
we are you and me,

1170
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,156
in our house, with our
kids downstairs...

1171
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:34,528
You know what, you can't
be saying those kinds

1172
01:05:34,629 --> 01:05:38,232
of things because my family
is right downstairs.

1173
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:42,436
It sounds a little crazy,
but I know that you're not,

1174
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,972
I know that
you're not crazy.

1175
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,974
Do you want me to
bring this shirt up?

1176
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:48,509
I'll come and
get it honey.

1177
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,345
I'll tell you what,

1178
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:53,447
I'm going to come
over tomorrow

1179
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:54,514
and I'm going
to put up your lights.

1180
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:55,683
That way your house
is looking great

1181
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,385
for the Christmas party

1182
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:00,321
and I know that will
brighten up your day.

1183
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:04,458
Is it hard
working for Nick?

1184
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:09,163
I don't think about it.

1185
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:11,599
The kids need things and
bills need to be paid,

1186
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,302
and there's just not a lot
of work around Christmas.

1187
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,571
I'll see you tomorrow.

1188
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:26,146
Okay go.

1189
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:28,315
Three nines.

1190
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:29,784
Okay, my turn.

1191
01:06:34,322 --> 01:06:36,357
Hey, hey...

1192
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:37,558
Hi...

1193
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:39,159
Mrs. Kensington.

1194
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,861
Hi.

1195
01:06:42,997 --> 01:06:44,365
I'm gonna go.

1196
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,200
Gotta go rest up for your
big Christmas eve party

1197
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:47,268
tomorrow night?

1198
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:48,769
I hope you two
will be there -

1199
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,405
and you, of course,
too Reg.

1200
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,174
Yeah, Nick already
invited us.

1201
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:55,476
We'll see.

1202
01:06:55,577 --> 01:07:00,047
The kids might be tired;
we might be tired.

1203
01:07:00,148 --> 01:07:02,550
I think I have plans.

1204
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,619
Sorry.

1205
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,454
Well, no, I mean, you
guys have to come.

1206
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:08,623
I wouldn't know
what to wear.

1207
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:09,990
No, it's not
like that.

1208
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:12,326
Come as you are.

1209
01:07:12,427 --> 01:07:14,095
You two kids go already.

1210
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,932
Come on girls, let's get
you upstairs to bed.

1211
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:19,200
Coming.

1212
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,935
Night.

1213
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,604
Goodnight Dad.

1214
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:24,939
All right, you
ready to go dance?

1215
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,041
[laughter]

1216
01:07:27,142 --> 01:07:29,877
Okay then,
I gotta go.

1217
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:34,849
Hang on.

1218
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:36,883
Hey, we'll see you
tomorrow; hang in there.

1219
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:53,968
Shall we?

1220
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:55,836
What was that all about?

1221
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:57,638
Problems at home.

1222
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,273
What's that got
to do with you?

1223
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:01,342
It's me sweetheart.

1224
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:03,811
You have nothing
to worry about,

1225
01:08:03,912 --> 01:08:06,147
so let's go.

1226
01:08:27,235 --> 01:08:29,470
Mrs. K., are you
looking for something?

1227
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:30,537
Where's Gary?

1228
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:31,639
I don't know.

1229
01:08:33,241 --> 01:08:35,008
What do you mean?

1230
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:37,445
He had a problem with his
drill, so he had to go.

1231
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,714
He says not to worry,

1232
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,948
the lights still be done
in time for the party.

1233
01:08:43,618 --> 01:08:49,289
[Music]

1234
01:09:13,882 --> 01:09:14,982
You came back.

1235
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:24,992
You came back.

1236
01:09:25,093 --> 01:09:26,493
I told Martina I
wouldn't let you down.

1237
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:28,195
I just had to get
my drill fixed.

1238
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:30,096
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1239
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:32,466
Come in.

1240
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,269
I was just afraid that you
weren't going to come back,

1241
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:37,071
you know.

1242
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:39,873
I just felt like maybe you
were going leave me here.

1243
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:41,141
Please don't
leave me here.

1244
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:42,976
Leave you here?

1245
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:44,979
It's okay.

1246
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:46,681
I just really
want to come home.

1247
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:48,515
I understand.

1248
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:50,151
You do?

1249
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,485
Of course I do.

1250
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:53,220
You do? You want me
to come home too?

1251
01:09:53,321 --> 01:09:56,056
I want you to be happy.

1252
01:09:56,157 --> 01:10:01,462
Yeah, right now I'm happy.

1253
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:03,097
That's good.

1254
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:06,267
That's good.

1255
01:10:08,169 --> 01:10:10,605
You know what I want?

1256
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,606
I really just want
you to kiss me.

1257
01:10:19,147 --> 01:10:21,281
I can't.

1258
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:28,923
Here's the thing Paula.

1259
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,258
I made a choice
a long time ago.

1260
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,627
And?

1261
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,464
And I'm happy
with that.

1262
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,370
Right.

1263
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,238
Right. Choices.

1264
01:10:44,339 --> 01:10:45,973
Right.

1265
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,479
Paula, I'm sorry.

1266
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,882
I'm taken.

1267
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,893
I don't think I can get
out the way I came in,

1268
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:10,164
so...

1269
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:11,598
if you'll excuse me.

1270
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:29,917
Mrs. Kensington,
what are you doing?

1271
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:31,084
What are you doing?

1272
01:11:31,185 --> 01:11:32,852
Oh, I'm not
Mrs. Kensington,

1273
01:11:32,954 --> 01:11:35,289
I'm Mrs. Ferguson!

1274
01:11:37,525 --> 01:11:40,026
You're not okay.

1275
01:11:40,127 --> 01:11:42,362
What's really
bothering you?

1276
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:46,733
Oh, everything.

1277
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:49,836
My life is so empty.

1278
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:53,239
Here I am, finally,
with all this money,

1279
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:55,475
and it means nothing.

1280
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,645
Why am I so miserable?

1281
01:11:58,746 --> 01:12:03,283
Because life without love,
it is not worth anything.

1282
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,019
Yeah, that's true.

1283
01:12:08,856 --> 01:12:10,590
I know.

1284
01:12:12,193 --> 01:12:15,729
I have love in my life.

1285
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:17,164
You do?

1286
01:12:17,265 --> 01:12:18,432
Yeah.

1287
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:21,401
I've been married for
23 years with Carlos

1288
01:12:21,502 --> 01:12:25,205
and we have raised three boys
and I'm a grandmother too.

1289
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:26,907
You are?

1290
01:12:27,008 --> 01:12:28,509
You raised three boys?

1291
01:12:29,811 --> 01:12:30,844
How come I
didn't know this?

1292
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:32,946
You never ask.

1293
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:36,216
Oh, I'm sorry Martina.

1294
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:38,251
I should have asked
you about your life.

1295
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,556
Was I good to you?

1296
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:45,425
You've been nice.

1297
01:12:45,526 --> 01:12:47,227
I make a nice life
with my family,

1298
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:49,429
my boys are happy.

1299
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,398
That's what's important.

1300
01:12:51,499 --> 01:12:57,171
Yeah, I made a nice life
with my family once too,

1301
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,373
and I just let it go.

1302
01:13:01,743 --> 01:13:03,710
Now I want it back.

1303
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:05,145
All of it!

1304
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,048
But I don't know how to
get back through the dryer.

1305
01:13:11,953 --> 01:13:13,720
Do you know that I
have two little girls?

1306
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:15,422
I didn't know that.

1307
01:13:15,523 --> 01:13:18,826
And Gary and I, we've been
married for 18 years.

1308
01:13:18,926 --> 01:13:22,162
Mr. Ferguson,
the light man?

1309
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,631
Yeah.

1310
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,599
And now my biggest fear is
that I'm going to be stuck

1311
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,668
here in this world and
I'm never going to get

1312
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:29,703
my old one back.

1313
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:32,906
I miss my little girls.

1314
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:36,610
I miss them, and
I miss everything.

1315
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:39,913
It was really good,
you know; it was good.

1316
01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:45,185
And Gary and I, we
really love each other.

1317
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:47,120
Mrs. K.

1318
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:51,725
I need to call
Dr. Degolia, okay?

1319
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,264
I'm going to go shopping.

1320
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,044
I just need to make
sure that they both

1321
01:14:11,145 --> 01:14:12,979
get to this address.

1322
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:16,050
This one needs to have
Eleanor's name on it

1323
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:22,322
and this one, this
one is Olivia.

1324
01:14:22,423 --> 01:14:24,291
Do you want to
include a gift card?

1325
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:33,533
Um, no.

1326
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:36,604
No gift card.

1327
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,573
I need you to make sure

1328
01:14:39,674 --> 01:14:41,541
that they get there
tonight, though.

1329
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:45,179
On Christmas Eve?

1330
01:14:48,683 --> 01:14:49,917
Please?

1331
01:14:50,017 --> 01:14:52,319
Of course,
Mrs. Kensington.

1332
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,988
I'll personally see to it
that they arrive tonight.

1333
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:57,324
Promise?

1334
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:58,859
I'll take care of it.

1335
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,093
Merry Christmas to you.

1336
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:04,298
Yes, right,
American Express...

1337
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,534
Right, same address,
for Gary Ferguson.

1338
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:14,908
And that's the high
speed cordless drill.

1339
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:16,710
Right, and make sure he
gets an extra battery

1340
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:20,580
and a super charger.

1341
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,549
No, I know, I need
it on Christmas -

1342
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:23,850
it's a Christmas gift.

1343
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:26,219
It will be there
tonight, right?

1344
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,988
Okay, thank you.

1345
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:32,492
Ho Ho Ho.

1346
01:15:32,593 --> 01:15:36,563
Merry Christmas!

1347
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:41,101
Ho Ho Ho, holy mackerel!

1348
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:42,436
Merry Christmas.

1349
01:15:42,537 --> 01:15:43,604
Merry Christmas to you.

1350

[Music]

1351
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,661
White wine?

1352
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,098
Fabulous
decorations,

1353
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,699
ample food, and
decent drink.

1354
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,668
You'd never know.

1355
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:18,338
Best divorce party I've
been to on a Christmas Eve.

1356
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,975
Poor Paula.
And where is she?

1357
01:16:21,075 --> 01:16:23,710
No sign of her.

1358
01:16:23,811 --> 01:16:25,913
Seen plenty of
Sheila though.

1359
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,415
Living room, far corner.

1360
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:44,231
I feel like people
are staring at me.

1361
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:47,968
So what, It's my party
and I want you here.

1362
01:16:48,069 --> 01:16:49,469
The timing
might look odd.

1363
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,304
The timing is perfect.

1364
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:54,008
In an hour and a half,
I'll be a free man.

1365
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,342
You don't want me
to get snaffled up

1366
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:56,943
by someone else, do you?

1367
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:58,311
I do not.

1368
01:16:58,412 --> 01:16:59,780
I want you all to myself.

1369
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:08,388
If I were Paula I'd make
sure I got the Condo.

1370
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:09,789
She'll land on her feet.

1371
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,057
I know her.

1372
01:17:22,536 --> 01:17:24,237
Your guests
are here.

1373
01:17:24,338 --> 01:17:26,840
They're wondering
where you are.

1374
01:17:26,941 --> 01:17:29,376
Is Gary here?

1375
01:17:29,477 --> 01:17:30,944
Everybody else
is here, but no,

1376
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:33,414
Mr. Ferguson is not here.

1377
01:17:33,514 --> 01:17:37,384
You should come down
and greet your guests.

1378
01:17:40,388 --> 01:17:43,323
I don't really have
anything to say.

1379
01:17:43,424 --> 01:17:48,261
Well, just say
Merry Christmas;

1380
01:17:48,362 --> 01:17:50,530
thank you for coming;

1381
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:53,634
I like your dress;

1382
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,302
try the crab cakes.

1383
01:18:14,955 --> 01:18:19,893
[music and chatter throughout]

1384
01:18:58,266 --> 01:18:59,866
Thank you for coming.

1385
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:01,134
I love your dress.

1386

[chatter continues]

1387
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:21,421
Oh Paula!

1388
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:24,658
Oh...

1389
01:19:24,759 --> 01:19:26,959
have you tried
to crab cake?

1390
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:30,863
No, should I?

1391
01:19:30,965 --> 01:19:32,465
I don't know.

1392
01:19:32,566 --> 01:19:34,333
I don't know; Martina
told me to say that.

1393
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:41,274
You know, I want
to tell you that I hope

1394
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:45,178
that you and Nick are actually
really very happy together.

1395
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:48,982
Really?

1396
01:19:51,085 --> 01:19:53,086
That's good of you to say.

1397
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:55,856
I was never
right for him.

1398
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,091
I'm sure he
told you that.

1399
01:20:00,094 --> 01:20:03,096
I think you will be.

1400
01:20:06,534 --> 01:20:08,902
Merry Christmas.

1401
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:11,305
Merry Christmas.

1402
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:13,239
Excuse me.

1403
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,659
For you.

1404
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,427
Oh.

1405
01:20:46,673 --> 01:20:48,242
This is too beautiful!

1406
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,442
Do you like them?

1407
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:51,812
This is too much.

1408
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,914
No, no it isn't.

1409
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,248
Gosh, you're such a
good friend to me.

1410
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:56,382
You deserve these.

1411
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:57,684
No, this is
too much money.

1412
01:20:57,785 --> 01:20:59,819
It's not enough money.

1413
01:21:02,289 --> 01:21:03,990
You're always
there for me.

1414
01:21:04,091 --> 01:21:06,994
You deserve these.

1415
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:11,564
Merry Christmas.

1416
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:15,335
Gracias.

You never know when
a door will open.

1419
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,249
He's not coming.

1420
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:32,552
Paula?

1421
01:21:35,489 --> 01:21:37,357
Hi!

1422
01:21:39,193 --> 01:21:41,327
I didn't think you
were going to come.

1423
01:21:44,932 --> 01:21:46,033
Here.

1424
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:47,500
For me?

1425
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:52,439
You didn't have
to do that.

1426
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,207
Better not be expensive.

1427
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:56,175
Trust me, it's not.

You've been so
unhappy lately;

make you smile.

01:22:56,737 --> 01:22:59,239
Hi. Hi!

1442
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:03,677
I missed you guys so much.

1443
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:06,245
I missed you guys so much!

1444
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:13,053
Let me see you.

1445
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:18,658
Mommy, Mommy,
come upstairs.

1446
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,560
Look at the tree.

1447
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:23,396
Okay, let's do that.

1448
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:25,198
No place like home huh?

1449
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:26,966
There's no
place like home.

1450
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:28,901
I'll tell you what, come
on, let's see that tree.

1451
01:23:41,581 --> 01:23:42,782
I love the tree.

1452
01:23:42,883 --> 01:23:45,284
[doorbell]

1453
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:52,392
[door closes]

1454
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:55,695
Who can these
be from, huh?

1455
01:23:56,897 --> 01:23:58,464
Look!

1456
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:01,635
Open them,
open them!

1457
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,437
There's no name
on the tag.

1458
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:05,805
Me either.

1459
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,485
These are awesome!

1460
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:22,255
Whoever they are, this is
exactly what I wanted.

1461
01:24:22,356 --> 01:24:25,191
Maybe it's from Santa.

1462
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:29,029
But he forgot to get
one for you mommy.

1463
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:31,964
I don't need one.

1464
01:24:32,066 --> 01:24:35,035
I have everything
I want, right here.

1465
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:37,070
I think I can fix that.

1466
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:41,407
This is for you.

1467
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:01,928
You've been so
unhappy lately,

1468
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:06,266
I thought this would
make you smile.

1469
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:07,366
It's exactly
what I wanted!

1470
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:16,542
[Music]

1471
01:25:16,643 --> 01:25:18,678
I love you, you know that?

1472
01:25:18,779 --> 01:25:22,816
¶ Jingle bells, Jingle
bells, jingle all the way. ¶

1473
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,617
Put this one on
the tree girls.

1474
01:25:24,718 --> 01:25:32,359
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh. ¶

1475
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:39,565
¶ Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way. ¶

1476
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:45,672
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh. ¶

1477
01:25:47,241 --> 01:25:54,747
¶ Jingle bells, Jingle
bells, jingle all the way. ¶

1478
01:25:54,849 --> 01:26:02,088
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh. ¶

1479
01:26:02,189 --> 01:26:09,896
¶ Jingle bells, Jingle
bells, jingle all the way. ¶

1480
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:18,271
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh. ¶

1481
01:26:18,372 --> 01:26:19,872
Honey?

1482
01:26:19,973 --> 01:26:24,844
¶ Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh ¶

1483
01:26:24,945 --> 01:26:28,081
¶ O'er the fields we go,
laughing all the way. ¶

1484
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:32,452
-May I have this dance?
-I'd love it.

1485
01:26:32,553 --> 01:26:39,859
¶ Bells on bobtails ring,
making spirits bright. ¶

1486
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:43,629
¶ What fun it is
to laugh and sing ¶

1487
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:46,566
¶ this sleighing
song tonight. ¶

1488
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:48,334
[laughter, chatter]

1489
01:26:48,435 --> 01:26:55,508
¶ Jingle bells, Jingle bells,
jingle all the way. ¶

1490
01:26:55,609 --> 01:26:58,612
¶ Oh what fun it
is to ride ¶

1491
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:03,149
¶ in a one-horse
open sleigh. ¶

1492
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:07,354
¶ Oh jingle bells,
jingle all the way. ¶

1493
01:27:07,455 --> 01:28:29,901
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh. ¶
