2
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,071
-Dr. Merivel.
-In a moment.

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,190
-Doctor!
-In a moment!

4
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,436
-Merivel, we must move on.
-I've sprinkled the lavell in to heal.

5
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,597
This will strengthen the hand. We must
not allow the tendons to atrophy.

6
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,557
-Merivel!
-I'll return this afternoon.

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,711
Old Mr. Parr is suffering from
an extreme shortness of breath.

8
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,310
-What do you prescribe?
-Let's try some syrup of sage flower.

9
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,685
-Doctor! Doctor!
-Citron pills to relieve coughing.

10
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:03,012
-Doctor! -I shall be with you
presently, Mr. Watchurst.

11
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:05,949
-I'm starving.
-You can't be.

12
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:07,869
-I am.
-You've already eaten.

13
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,267
I had a piece of bread
and scarcely any cheese.

14
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,188
There's no time to eat!

15
00:02:12,237 --> 00:02:15,115
For the five years we've worked here,
there is never time to eat.

16
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:18,388
There is no time to drink. There is no
time, even, to look after our patients.

17
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:21,450
Doctor! Doctor Merivel!

18
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:23,492
Samuel needs you.

19
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:26,714
Sam-Samuel! Samuel!
Look... Look at me!

20
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:31,625
It's Robert. It's Robert. Quiet now.
Be quiet. Be quiet.

21
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:36,152
Merivel! You must see to Parr.
He'll only accept comfort from you.

22
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:39,272
Give him a complice for his head
and some chamomile.

23
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:41,249
Mr. Parr!

24
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,764
Mr. Parr, tell me
how you're feeling.

25
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:48,566
Is there hope
I will get well again?

26
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,935
There is always hope.

27
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:56,872
You must rest and allow
my medicines to do their work.

28
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:01,591
Dr. Merivel!
Doctor!

29
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,864
I-I do what I can
to treat them.

30
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:06,785
But our science gives us no hope
of curing most of them,

31
00:03:06,832 --> 00:03:08,868
and I am frustrated!

32
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:11,591
No, I'm... frightened.

33
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,509
Of what?

34
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:16,389
Their faith
and my ignorance.

35
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:19,543
That is why you prefer
a life of debauchery.

36
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,822
Your mother died believing
you were a man of honor.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:27,142
And I beg her pardon every night, and
I am at the hospital every day for her.

38
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,944
You mean your whoring is interrupted
daily by the care of the sick.

39
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,988
You've not come to me for money
to spend on your medicines.

40
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,400
Indeed I have, in a sense.

41
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,009
The five shillings
I require are for...

42
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:42,320
well, for a pawnbroker so I can
redeem my case of instruments.

43
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:44,485
Father, I am sorry
to confess it.

44
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,957
-You should be damned for it.
-I should.

45
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,568
Look. Look at these hands.
Look at them.

46
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:52,082
Worked to the bone for
your case of instruments,

47
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,006
for your teachers and for
the books on your table.

48
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:57,442
Or have they
been pawned too?

49
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,161
So that the son of a glove maker...

50
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:03,045
should not be denied
the use of those gifts...

51
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:06,635
which marked you as a physician
before you could spell "physic".

52
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,483
My gifts?

53
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,397
Your gifts, Robert.

54
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,317
Oh, yes, my gifts.

55
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:15,318
My first patient was a frog.
I cured him of jumping.

56
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,555
Now I can cure people
of breathing.

57
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:20,205
My gifts, Father, bring me
to dark despair in dark rooms...

58
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:22,315
so I can hear joy
in the street.

59
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,323
The King is restored to us,
the theaters are open,

60
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:28,083
the tailors and wig makers
are happy as whores...

61
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:30,758
and rich men
go to heaven again.

62
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,312
I would like to shake
the King's hand.

63
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,440
Take the hand of your
friend Pearce, Robert.

64
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,520
He is the example
to follow.

65
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:39,793
He may dress like a crow,

66
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,198
but he once infected himself
with scarlet fever,

67
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,114
the better to study
the disease.

68
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:47,718
Well, in my own small way,
I'm doing the same for the clap.

69
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:55,639
Look at this glove.
Touch it.

70
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:00,473
This glove
is for the King.

71
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:03,633
And that is the closest
you will ever get...

72
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:07,390
to touching the hand
of the King of England.

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,074
Here are your
five shillings.

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,114
Redeem your case
of instruments.

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,595
And if you've a heart,

76
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,954
redeem your gift, Robert.

77
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,270
Thank you, Father.

78
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,111
And don't spend
the money on women.

79
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:37,696
Merivel! I must prevail on you...

80
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,808
to come to the examining
theater this instant.

81
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:42,491
I won't be
a moment, Pearce.

82
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:46,654
Merivel!

83
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:50,530
He's probably fled
because of your antics.

84
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,613
Pearce, you must not take
my romping as an affront to you.

85
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:55,726
I simply answer
the call of nature.

86
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:58,694
Yes, well, your nature,
like mine, is very much fallen.

87
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:01,773
That awful truth ought to go somewhere

88
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,851
towards discouraging your
unsightly bouts of debauchery.

89
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:07,723
I suppose you're right.
But I do very much enjoy them.

90
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:10,653
This is the fellow.

91
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,965
Shall I unbuckle?

92
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:23,284
Please, yes.

93
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:34,886
Good God!

94
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,003
A fracture of the ribs occasioned
by a fall from his horse...

95
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,083
was brought to
a terrible suppuration.

96
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,487
The doctors feared
it would never heal.

97
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:44,285
You can see the sconce of
the old ulcer at the edge here.

98
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,202
Yes.

99
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:50,284
Merivel, we are witnessing
a living, beating heart.

100
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,323
Might a man touch it
with his hand?

101
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,765
No one has ever dared.

102
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,167
Yes. Yes?

103
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,000
Sir?

104
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,684
I cannot.

105
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:27,157
-Pearce, it's just...
-Please! I mean... Just please...

106
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,118
Perhaps your friend.

107
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,396
Are you not afraid?

108
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:48,363
I'm beyond fear, sir.
Are you?

109
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,839
You're touching
the organ, sir?

110
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,483
Can you not feel my grip?

111
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:15,282
I feel nothing at all.

112
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,194
No pain?

113
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:19,159
Nothing.

114
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:27,497
Tell me, who is
the young doctor?

115
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:30,812
Robert Merivel,
Your Majesty.

116
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:35,651
You will summon him to the palace
this very afternoon.

117
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,972
Watch where you're going,
you fool!

118
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:49,491
Your stockings.

119
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:01,803
It's the young doctor,
Your Majesty.

120
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:05,967
Do you know why
I've summoned you here?

121
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,842
I...

122
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,881
A great heaviness
hangs over me...

123
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:24,361
causing me a most
abject desperation.

124
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,769
Someone very close to me
is dying.

125
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,284
Someone without whom
I cannot live.

126
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,887
My doctors have
bled her repeatedly;

127
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,604
have tried, without success,
lesions, emetics and purges.

128
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:44,238
Shaved the hair off her body
in order to cup her.

129
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,597
But she does not rally.

130
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:52,206
You are my final hope,
Merivel.

131
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:56,240
If you can cure her, I will offer you
a place here as a court physician.

132
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,397
And if I fail?

133
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:03,082
You must not fail.

134
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,358
Her name is Lou Lou.

135
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:12,079
"Lou Lou", Your Majesty?

136
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:14,879
Your own name, by the way,
has a very pleasing cadence.

137
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,797
Thank you, Sire.

138
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:20,161
Merivel.
Very pretty to the ear.

139
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:27,721
Lou Lou?

140
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:32,473
Oh, my darling is not well.

141
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:36,478
Come, Merivel.

142
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:43,282
Call for any medicines,
anything you deem suitable.

143
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:49,555
You will stay until the
little creature recovers.

144
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:51,513
Of course.

145
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,118
Do not disappoint me,
Merivel.

146
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:59,073
I shall not, Sire.

147
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:11,398
There was a time
she would've answered me.

148
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,788
What have they done to you?

149
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,793
My dear Pearce,

150
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,987
by the time you read this letter
my fate will be sealed.

151
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:57,227
This morning, my future
never glowed so bright,

152
00:12:57,316 --> 00:13:00,991
and now it is sputtering out
in the life of a sick spaniel.

153
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:04,624
If I save her, my life
will be changed utterly.

154
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:08,224
If she dies,
I may as well go with her.

155
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,829
I think of our great teacher,
William Harvey.

156
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,946
Though I was often drunk at his
lectures, I remember his cry:

157
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:20,071
"Trust in the power of nature".

158
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:24,750
Is that the best hope now,
for Lou Lou and me?

159
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:29,190
To let her sleep and give nature
a chance to work quietly within her?

160
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:32,026
But what if I'm wrong?

161
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:36,543
How will I explain this
prescription to His Majesty?

162
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:29,215
This is well done.
I like you, Merivel.

163
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:32,180
Yours is a curious
and original mind.

164
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:35,543
And in this new age,
originality is of great value.

165
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,614
We shall open our palace
to you, Merivel...

166
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:41,742
its treasures
and temptations...

167
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,220
and we shall see
what you make of yourself.

168
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,495
Thank you, Sire.

169
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,503
You have been given an extraordinary
opportunity for one of your rank.

170
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,422
Haven't I?
I have...

171
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:59,581
-You must at every moment
please the King. -That would mean...

172
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:02,457
-If you do not, suffice it to say,
I shall be watching. -Good.

173
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:05,820
Now it is my task to lay out for you
your life in this place.

174
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:11,774
This shall be your lodging.

175
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:15,014
The royal tailors will be
continually at your disposal.

176
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:20,017
And these shall be
your playfellows.

177
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:38,617
This paper sets forth the following
duties for one Robert Merivel, physician:

178
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:42,409
The daily care and comfort
of the 18 royal dogs...

179
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,334
with, as required, the right
to perform operations upon them.

180
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,816
It's ten years wasted. I'm warning you,
your life will be undone.

181
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:54,693
No, not wasted, Pearce, for those years
have brought me to this new life.

182
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,532
I'm to the palace,
and that's an end of it.

183
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:06,616
My dear, we must be
pleased for each other.

184
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,854
You must be pleased
for my appointment...

185
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:13,453
as I am pleased that you have,
uh, given up drinking sack.

186
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,176
And found my peace
in Quakerism.

187
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:18,936
Even so, Pearce.
Even so.

188
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,567
My dear Pearce,

189
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:28,806
a year has passed
most profitably and pleasurably,

190
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:31,126
leaving me no moment
in which to write to you.

191
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:33,530
All day I am thick
in the affairs of state,

192
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,009
yet I manage to employ
my medical knowledge...

193
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:38,649
especially in anatomy...
in the services of the King,

194
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:42,404
who's particularly fond
of my trick of farting at will.

195
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,691
I am Aeolius,

196
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:48,368
King of the Winds!

197
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:55,488
That my dear departed father
could see me now,

198
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,768
for the King shows me
a flattering affection...

199
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:01,084
that stems, I suspect,
from my ability to amuse him.

200
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:28,604
Our physician
has become our fool.

201
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,726
What do you make
of the preparations, Merivel?

202
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,527
Oh, sir. Most wondrous, Sire!
What is it for?

203
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:51,838
-A wedding.
-Ohh!

204
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:54,038
-A most lavish affair!
-Yes.

205
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:57,802
-Who's to be married?
-Celia Clemence.

206
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:01,960
Um... I understood
she was your mistress.

207
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,157
Then you understood
right, Merivel.

208
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,238
That is generosity indeed.

209
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,362
Merivel, let me explain.

210
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:10,442
Celia Clemence's
presence in my bed...

211
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:12,835
continues to be necessity.

212
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:16,435
So, too, does that of my grand amour,
Barbara Castlemaine.

213
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:19,358
But her tantrums on the
subject of Miss Clemence...

214
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:21,476
are making me edgy.

215
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:24,955
So... Miss Clemence
is to be married...

216
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:28,639
and seemingly dispatched
out of London with her husband,

217
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:32,194
while, in fact, I secret her
near the river in Kew,

218
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:34,479
the better to sport
with her unobserved.

219
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:39,277
And for her husband, I need a man...

220
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:41,439
who is far too enamored
of women in general...

221
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:43,958
to make the mistake of
loving one in particular.

222
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:47,160
Ah! Again, a most superior
aspect of the plan.

223
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:49,981
And whom has Your Majesty chosen
for this particular honor?

224
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,657
Yes, in fact I've decided that you
should be the one to marry her, Merivel.

225
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,653
Marry, Your Majesty?

226
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:59,734
"Marry Merivel". The phrase
is very pretty to my ear.

227
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:01,976
But, Sire,
I do not wish to marry...

228
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:05,013
I'm not asking you to wish it.
I'm asking you to do it.

229
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,895
Merivel, have I not done you
very many favors in the past?

230
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,812
Yes, Sire,
many favors, but...

231
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,336
-Voila. You owe me
at least one in return.

232
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,499
I shall, of course,
reward you for it.

233
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,130
Make you a knight, give you
a most agreeable estate in Suffolk...

234
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,091
-and my second best bed.
-I would prefer to stay at court.

235
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,329
No, no.
You will go to Suffolk...

236
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,728
and you will make something
of the house.

237
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:32,848
And, perhaps,
if the time is right,

238
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,213
we shall favor you
with a visit.

239
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,567
-Aye.
-Go now.

240
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:42,254
Only remember this, Merivel:
If she's over there with you,

241
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:46,495
there will be no intimacy
of any kind between you.

242
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:50,365
Though she is your wife,
she is yours in name only.

243
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:53,886
You are to be
a paper bridegroom.

244
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:59,216
Voila, mademoiselle.

245
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:04,204
Un, deux,

246
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:06,172
troix.

247
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:12,451
"Sir Robert Merivel, Bidnold".

248
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:16,770
Nova vel noviter inventa.

249
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:19,891
Observationes proprias
et alienas recensere...

250
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:23,131
ad considerandum
propriam opinionem...

251
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:25,483
vel obsignatis tabulis...

252
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:29,651
in aliis animalibus agere
secundum Socratis regulam.

253
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:34,124
Unde observationes exoticas...

254
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,487
I've come to give you these.

255
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:43,366
-These are... These are your medical books!
-I know.

256
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:47,239
-Your copy of Harvey.
-I know.

257
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,363
I have resolved
to abandon medicine.

258
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:53,568
The King has made
other plans for me.

259
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:57,438
I have been given a knighthood,
an estate and a wife.

260
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,119
This is my time of preferment, Pearce.
This is my time.

261
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,360
What?

262
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,287
Nothing.

263
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,160
Merivel!

264
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,647
When you stood in this room...

265
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,038
and put your hand
around that man's heart...

266
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:17,201
something I did not dare do
that day...

267
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:20,519
your vital flame
was burning.

268
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:25,323
Now, you see, the light
has gone out of your eyes.

269
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,359
No, my study of medicine
has given me nothing...

270
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,160
but a perpetual and visible
awareness of mortality;

271
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,916
that were I to continue, it would
very shortly bring me to despair.

272
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,237
-Very well.
-I must see to my dogs.

273
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,481
Very well!

274
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,977
Merivel!

275
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,057
Merivel!

276
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:49,276
Merivel!

277
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:52,617
Harvey revealed his work to us
so that treading in the same path...

278
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:54,740
we might discover very many things
as yet unknown to others.

279
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,763
-You have a gift for healing, Merivel.
-I do not!

280
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:02,757
Yes. Oh, yes, you do.
For understanding sickness.

281
00:22:02,844 --> 00:22:05,597
Death is a terrible thing, Pearce.

282
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:08,636
I need color and light,
not darkness and death.

283
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:11,442
I feel I've had quite enough
of dark things.

284
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:14,441
I want bright things
and decorative things.

285
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:17,799
I am, after all,
a creature of the new age.

286
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:21,478
I shall pray for you.

287
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:26,755
Come along, Mr. Bung.

288
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,689
Your bride.

289
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:09,684
He filled your jar with spice!

290
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:12,610
To the wedding chamber!

291
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:25,182
-Bed her well, Merivel!
Bed her well, Merivel!

292
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,266
Bed her well, Merivel!

293
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,183
Bed her well, Merivel!
Bed her well!

294
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,819
Bed her well, Merivel!
Bed her well, Merivel!

295
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,579
Bed her well, Merivel!

296
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:44,860
Fair thee well!

297
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:51,365
-I believe our kiss
convinced them, Lady Celia.

298
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:10,581
Well done, Merivel.

299
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:13,937
Well done!
We fooled 'em all.

300
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:20,295
You are a most useful fellow, Merivel.
Most useful!

301
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:25,136
And at the moment you
are most useful to me...

302
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,420
in Suffolk.

303
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:34,819
Oh. Yes.

304
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:40,095
Your disguise is behind the pillar.

305
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:12,374
Pearce, this will make no sense to you,
as it makes no sense to me,

306
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:17,174
but the moment I saw Lady Celia
I was captivated by her.

307
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,172
When I think of her,
I feel faint, my heart aches...

308
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,773
and I fear
there is no cure for me,

309
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:25,817
for I cannot stop thinking
of her, even in my sleep.

310
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,012
Sir Robert!

311
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:49,130
Welcome to Bidnold.

312
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:56,805
Ah, Will Gates
at your service.

313
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,485
You are alone, sir?

314
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,931
Yes. Lady Merivel desired
that I act as a vanguard...

315
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,011
and see the lay of the land.

316
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:14,649
I trust that the wedding
went off as planned.

317
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:20,167
Yes, most well.
Um, I shall now retire.

318
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:27,172
Oh, could you send up
some strong liquor?

319
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:29,084
Yes, sir.

320
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,342
Good morning, Sir Robert.

321
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:43,064
Mr. Gates, I find
the house induces in me...

322
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,307
a most melancholy
frame of mind.

323
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:47,985
And exceeding dark.

324
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,386
The King confiscated it
from a Puritan.

325
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:52,342
Oh.

326
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,941
Mr. Gates.

327
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:58,419
I must be straight
with you.

328
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,538
We shall not expect
Lady Merivel's arrival for some time.

329
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,906
Well...

330
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:12,621
one cannot stay in bed
indefinitely.

331
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:16,867
What one needs
is a diversion.

332
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:19,985
The King told me to make
something of the house.

333
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:24,300
Oh! And you
are monarch here.

334
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,102
We shall have color and light!

335
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:31,581
With purples and golds
and crimsons and scarlets and carmines.

336
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:34,362
-What, all together in one place, sir?
-Yes, Mr. Gates.

337
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,093
We will make this house
so beautiful that if Lady Celia

338
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:39,177
were to pay us a visit,
she would never want to leave.

339
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:42,556
Ah, the Dutchman.

340
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,477
Yes!

341
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:47,797
All of it!

342
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:53,076
Yes!

343
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:01,443
Mr. Gates, to divert myself further...

344
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:04,118
and to display
our lavish decoration,

345
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:06,678
I feel the urge for company.

346
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:08,794
Perhaps a visit
from the neighbors...

347
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:11,636
will restore my old
uncontainable nature.

348
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:14,317
A pox on wisdom!

349
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:17,196
Let us all be
mares and stallions.

350
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:25,592
Sir Robert,
someone at the door.

351
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:30,358
What? At the door? Another man come
to whinny in our festivities!

352
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,674
Why do you not have
a turban?

353
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:36,315
Guy, supply Mr. Gates
with a turban!

354
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:43,113
Sir Robert Merivel.

355
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,964
Oh, Lady...

356
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,095
Would you show me
immediately to my rooms?

357
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,613
Yes, of course,
and without delay.

358
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,815
Without delay.

359
00:30:20,977 --> 00:30:22,808
Where am I?

360
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:26,047
I attempted to take you back
to your room last night, sir,

361
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:29,532
but you were most
insistent to sleep here.

362
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:32,966
What...
What's the bird?

363
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:36,132
A gift from Lady Violet.

364
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:41,652
Oh, Mr. Gates, I've just had
a most extraordinary dream.

365
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:46,290
I dreamed that Lady Celia did arrive
at Bidnold in the most foul humor.

366
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:50,247
I'm afraid she did, sir, and she
has now repaired to the garden room.

367
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:53,132
All right, now, gently. Gently.

368
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:01,244
Careful! Careful!

369
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,710
I've got it.

370
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:05,624
Keep it to your left.

371
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:11,787
Lady Celia.

372
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,982
I have come to bid you
welcome to Bidnold.

373
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:16,519
No, I do not desire
to be made welcome.

374
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:20,490
-The King will very soon ask me
back to him. -I'm sure he will.

375
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:24,086
I'm sure he has of late been
most distracted by the foreign wars.

376
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,849
But in the meantime,
if there's any comfort...

377
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,160
I might provide here at Bidnold
for Your Ladyship...

378
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,043
No, there is nothing.
Nothing.

379
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,363
Well... um, well, then
together we shall wait...

380
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:41,566
for the return
of the King's love.

381
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,885
Love?
You use that word?

382
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,607
The King and his love for me
made use of you.

383
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:51,084
He looked around for the stupidest man
he could find, and he found you.

384
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:54,205
I begged him not to marry me
to such a fool.

385
00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:58,997
I have brought a...

386
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,806
Stay away from me.

387
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:08,343
"Celia, my loneliness consumes me,

388
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:12,254
but I see your unhappiness
is as great as mine".

389
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:40,413
Well, come in, please.

390
00:32:40,504 --> 00:32:43,301
I hope my playing
isn't disturbing you.

391
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:46,062
No, it is I
who am disturbing you.

392
00:32:46,143 --> 00:32:48,782
I... No.

393
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:50,899
What is the bird?

394
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:55,533
I am told it is an Indian nightingale.
It was a gift.

395
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:58,142
-From the King?
-Yes, from the King.

396
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,178
-It's most beautiful.
-Mmm.

397
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:11,014
-Only it does not sing.
-No.

398
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:13,250
Perhaps it wants
encouragement.

399
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,339
Now, if it were to hear you play,
for your playing, as I recall,

400
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,417
has about it an exceeding sweetness.

401
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,971
Would it be asking too much
if I were to keep the bird in my room?

402
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:28,448
No, nothing would be
too much. Will!

403
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,099
No, no. I'll...

404
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,693
And let the garden room
be my private habitation,

405
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:38,333
where I shall perhaps
from time to time invite you.

406
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,371
Um...

407
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,931
I find much of the decoration
here rather disturbing.

408
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:47,451
Yes, certain of the servants
regularly complain of it.

409
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:51,286
Merivel, forgive me if I spoke before
of matters that do not regard me.

410
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:55,887
We live in an age where many
are made fools and many are deceived.

411
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:59,730
I, in my faith for the King's love,
am probably as foolish as you.

412
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,645
Oh.

413
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:20,093
It's from my old friend,
Mr. Pearce.

414
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:24,332
It seems he's now working
in a hospital with his Quakers.

415
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:31,762
Will, will you sit down?
Please.

416
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:41,883
Is there a Mrs. Gates?

417
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:44,730
Oh, no, sir.

418
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,209
The messy constellations
I see through my telescope...

419
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:52,322
offer me no clue
to my destiny.

420
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:56,404
There is, I fear, a great deal
about the world and my role in it...

421
00:34:56,491 --> 00:35:00,324
which, despite all my early learning,
I have utterly failed to understand.

422
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,647
I must restrain my thoughts and do
something altogether more constructive.

423
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,600
What is the matter, sir?

424
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:13,204
I have done the one thing
forbidden by the King:

425
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:16,008
I have fallen in love
with my wife.

426
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:35,399
Merivel, there is
someone to see you.

427
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:38,240
This is Mr. Finn,
a painter.

428
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:41,222
A painter?

429
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,820
A painter! Welcome!

430
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:47,336
A painter! Most excellent.

431
00:35:47,386 --> 00:35:49,342
-Did I send for a painter?
-No, sir.

432
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:52,781
Never mind.
I'm a keen painter myself.

433
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:06,943
I call it
"Le Matin de Merivel I'Automne".

434
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:12,296
What do you make of it,
honestly?

435
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:16,776
It is an excrescence.

436
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:20,418
Ah! Perhaps that is
the word for it.

437
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:23,534
But to me it's a rather
memorable rendering...

438
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:27,098
of all the colors
I have in my park.

439
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:29,377
You must not show
this painting to anyone.

440
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:31,584
-You must, I think, burn it.
-Oh.

441
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,871
Merivel, Mr. Finn has arrived
with a commission.

442
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,600
A commission!
From whom?

443
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:40,510
Robin Hood?

444
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:44,673
Robin Hood? Oh, yes.
My Lincoln green.

445
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,075
How funny.

446
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,953
Now, if I may,
this letter commands...

447
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,468
the following commission
by one Elias Finn, myself,

448
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,431
a noble and beautiful
portrait of Lady Merivel.

449
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,313
"An excellent painting will earn
Mr. Finn a small place at court".

450
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:02,152
So, you see,
not Robin Hood... the King.

451
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,069
Shall we go?

452
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:08,993
My imprisonment is over.
The King means me to return.

453
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:20,468
-Aw, cherubs.
-Uh-huh.

454
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:23,788
The King has often told me
he cannot abide the cherub.

455
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:26,788
I would not depend upon this
for your future, either of you.

456
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,714
-Why not, Merivel?
-It is a commission from the King.

457
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:31,986
My dear Flinn...
No, Finch...

458
00:37:32,076 --> 00:37:34,794
-Uh, "Finn".
-Oh.

459
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:36,949
Many portraits are
commissioned by the King,

460
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,360
and most of the poor artists
are still waiting to be paid.

461
00:37:40,395 --> 00:37:43,705
Yes, well, we shall have to make the
painting too beautiful to be resisted.

462
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:47,996
And, Celia, there seems to be
no mention of your returning to court.

463
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:52,056
-But why else would he ask for a portrait?
-Souvenir, perhaps.

464
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:54,150
A letter, Sir Robert.

465
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,111
Mmm.

466
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:01,037
From the King.

467
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:03,607
If I may!
If I may!

468
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:06,893
What mention does the King
make of the painting in his letter?

469
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:09,521
Oh, it's... None.

470
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:12,605
I would frame some message to him,
but I don't know what to say.

471
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:16,122
Celia, if I do not set sail now,
I shall not reach London by morning.

472
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:20,289
And we both know the King regards a
betrayal of time as a betrayal of faith.

473
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:53,738
...there is a void...

474
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,423
Ah, Merivel.
Is it you?

475
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:13,026
It is me.

476
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:15,899
It-It is in fact I, Sire.

477
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:34,041
Time has changed you,
Merivel.

478
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:36,779
As with many of my people, some
vital part of you appears to be asleep.

479
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:44,372
Something has arrived,
Merivel.

480
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:47,261
Something that may rouse
even you from sleep.

481
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:52,171
The plague.
La peste.

482
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:56,175
Deptford, four people
have died. It will spread.

483
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:59,493
Some of us will be spared
and some will die.

484
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:02,339
But all of us will awake.

485
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,811
Come along, Merivel.
There is much to discuss.

486
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,937
You see, I have started work
upon this toad.

487
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,170
-Ah.
-Will you help me to dissect it?

488
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,290
Yes, if you
wish me to, Sire.

489
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,853
Yes, I do wish you to,
Merivel.

490
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:28,336
I have summoned you
to talk about your wife.

491
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:32,298
Pin, Merivel.

492
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,731
When I married her to you,
it was to hide her...

493
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:41,733
from the intelligent gaze
of my mistress, Lady Castlemaine.

494
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:47,728
Now, observe the sheen of the gut.
It's like a jewel.

495
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:53,130
You may imagine, then, my fury
when she commanded me...

496
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,849
to end my liaison
with Lady Castlemaine...

497
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:58,848
and likewise
to terminate my amours...

498
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:02,372
with certain actresses
of the playhouse.

499
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:07,287
So I banished her
to Suffolk.

500
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,843
Now the grosser part of me...

501
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:12,967
is uncommonly sensible
to her absence.

502
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:16,808
The royal tool is waving about
in search of her.

503
00:41:18,134 --> 00:41:22,093
She is skillful and enthusiastic
in these matters.

504
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:27,407
Merivel, I desire you
to impress upon Celia...

505
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:30,849
to be content
with what she has.

506
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:34,363
Tell her to come to me in humility
and she may have it all again:

507
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:38,650
Her house, servants, money and the King
in her bed from time to time.

508
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:41,769
I desire her
penitent return...

509
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:44,082
when the portrait
is finished.

510
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:48,847
Um... he's a slow painter,
Your Majesty, what with all the cherubs.

511
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:51,684
What is a painting
without cherubs? Hmm?

512
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:53,687
Precisely, Sire.

513
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:55,682
Make this clear, Merivel:

514
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:59,803
I expect her in my bed
when the portrait is complete.

515
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,280
The King would give no promise
whatsoever with regard to you.

516
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,405
But he must
have said something.

517
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:10,644
He desired that you
stay here at Bidnold...

518
00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:13,761
until you became aware
of the changeful nature of all things.

519
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,519
But how long does he say
this will take?

520
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:20,003
Months? Years?

521
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:22,636
Am I to grow old
and see my beauty vanish...

522
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:25,185
and all that once pleased him
turn to decay?

523
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:27,275
I'm sure he does not
intend that,

524
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:29,673
but he has put the matter
into your hands and into mine.

525
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:32,358
Into your hands?

526
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,238
Yes.

527
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:37,478
For I am to judge
when you are ready.

528
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:41,002
And the King has promised to correspond
with me regularly over the matter.

529
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:43,554
And how shall I arrive
at this wisdom?

530
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:45,876
He has suggested, perhaps,
that we together...

531
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:48,395
exercise our gifts
for music.

532
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,323
-Just arrived, sir.
-Will, I need you to do something for me.

533
00:42:59,365 --> 00:43:03,243
-Anything, sir. -You must
forge a letter to me from the King.

534
00:43:03,324 --> 00:43:05,792
Sir.

535
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:10,354
And, uh, the King makes
no mention of a date...

536
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:13,475
for me to have, uh,
completed the painting?

537
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:15,559
-My dear Finch.
-"Finn".

538
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:17,514
Ah!

539
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:20,953
He has no interest, it seems,
in the painting whatsoever...

540
00:43:21,043 --> 00:43:24,273
but for his continued
suspicion of cherubs.

541
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:26,717
So it seems to me
that it is to music...

542
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:29,077
that His Majesty owes
his greatest affection.

543
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:31,881
-We are all mere pawns.
-Mmm! Prawns, yes.

544
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:34,759
No, no, "pawns".
"Pawns"!

545
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:41,758
Hmm.

546
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,113
Merivel, wake up.
There is something I must tell you.

547
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,350
Celia!

548
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,316
The bird is ill.

549
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:55,729
The bird. The bird.
Oh, the bird!

550
00:43:55,779 --> 00:43:57,213
Please, we must do something.

551
00:43:57,263 --> 00:43:59,263
Birds are not really
my specialty...

552
00:43:59,313 --> 00:44:01,068
But, Merivel,
it is dying!

553
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:14,195
Merivel, why are you
no longer a physician?

554
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:16,830
Um...

555
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:19,989
When I asked the King why
he was marrying me to such a fool,

556
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:22,955
he said that you had
a great gift for healing.

557
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:29,632
Perhaps I should stay.
We should watch over the bird together.

558
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:32,150
Yes, I would like that.

559
00:44:55,754 --> 00:44:57,630
It's dead.

560
00:45:15,992 --> 00:45:19,620
Are you not putting
yourself at terrible risk, sir?

561
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:22,788
Forging the King's seal
is a hanging offense.

562
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:25,265
I love her, Will.
I must do all I can...

563
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,785
to discourage
completion of the portrait.

564
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,866
Sir Robert?

565
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,105
I'm sure your wife
is greatly dismayed...

566
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,219
at the loss
of her favorite bird.

567
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,140
Inconsolable, I fear.

568
00:45:41,229 --> 00:45:43,663
Which must, in turn,
cause you much distress.

569
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:46,661
Of course.
I did all that I could.

570
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:49,546
Sir Robert, now that the painting
is nearly complete,

571
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:53,177
I feel it is my duty to thank you for
your hospitality during my stay here.

572
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,901
Th-Th-The desire
to finish the work...

573
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:58,337
has perhaps made me
less than an ideal guest.

574
00:45:58,468 --> 00:46:00,901
-For that I am sorry.
-No, matter, Finn. No matter.

575
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:03,860
I understand better than
most the lure of court.

576
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:05,943
-Sir Robert.
-Hmm?

577
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:08,416
May I be forward with you?

578
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:11,259
During my stay here,
I-I've noticed...

579
00:46:11,346 --> 00:46:13,496
that a certain bond
has formed...

580
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:16,623
between yourself
and Lady Merivel.

581
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:19,226
A-And that you are perhaps...

582
00:46:19,306 --> 00:46:21,978
although she has warmed
considerably...

583
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:24,539
unsure how to further
the matter.

584
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:29,904
Perhaps i-i-i-if I were
to broach the subject with her,

585
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:33,772
her natural shyness
might find some release?

586
00:46:35,184 --> 00:46:38,893
My God, it's a most
delicate situation.

587
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:41,253
But that might be
the very thing.

588
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:44,938
I think. Well, I'll do what I can.

589
00:46:47,863 --> 00:46:50,172
I will, of course,
act most subtly.

590
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:11,092
Merivel!

591
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:15,493
I have spoken to Lady Celia,
and my impression is...

592
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,378
that your advances
would not be unwelcome.

593
00:47:50,857 --> 00:47:55,327
Voila! Venus!
Uncommonly bright!

594
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:59,455
A good portent. Venus being the
brightest of all the evening stars...

595
00:47:59,536 --> 00:48:02,175
and the reigning planet
of earthly love.

596
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:04,167
Come and look.

597
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:10,849
Uh, uh...
Here. Here.

598
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:14,086
Ah.

599
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:19,605
-You're right, Merivel. It really
is a beautiful star. -Yes.

600
00:48:19,654 --> 00:48:22,691
And it smiles on us
from on high.

601
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:26,285
We are blessed.

602
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,282
Merivel?

603
00:48:55,451 --> 00:48:57,885
Merivel!

604
00:48:57,971 --> 00:49:00,245
No!

605
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,963
No! No!

606
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,679
Celia, you must think
no more of the King.

607
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,886
If he is not weary of you now,
he soon will be.

608
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:16,887
-You're wrong, Merivel.
The King wants me back.

609
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:21,359
Do you think he will curtail his amours
with the actresses of the playhouse? Never.

610
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:25,560
He is a loose fish!
He cannot be held or kept.

611
00:49:25,648 --> 00:49:30,641
I am your husband, and all that I ask
is that you allow me to love you.

612
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,359
It just arrived
from the palace, sir.

613
00:50:08,524 --> 00:50:10,435
Mr. Finn
has betrayed us.

614
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:13,481
I-I shall leave for
court in the morning.

615
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:20,276
And, Will, pack
one of our pineapples.

616
00:50:20,363 --> 00:50:23,001
I shall take it
as a gift to the King,

617
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,636
though I fear that...

618
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,599
What, sir?

619
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:30,315
That no offering of this
kind will be enough.

620
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:44,155
Ah, Merivel!

621
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,596
This is my new plan
for our native city, Merivel.

622
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,114
Yes, come along, Merivel.

623
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,958
See how Fleet Street
is thus straightened.

624
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:59,275
And there is here one straight view
from Ludgate Circus...

625
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:02,072
past St. Paul's
and on to the Royal Exchange.

626
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,151
And here's another street from
Smithfield down to the river...

627
00:51:06,238 --> 00:51:08,706
where, perhaps, the halls
of the lesser companies...

628
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:11,437
might be built
along Thames Quay.

629
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:17,908
All for the beauty, ornament
and convenience of the city.

630
00:51:17,957 --> 00:51:19,913
Sit down, Merivel.

631
00:51:20,037 --> 00:51:21,868
Ohh!

632
00:51:23,237 --> 00:51:25,796
I-It is a brave
new plan, Sire.

633
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:27,707
Now, I have...

634
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:31,505
Do you remember we once
made a plan together, Merivel?

635
00:51:31,596 --> 00:51:34,474
And in that plan,
love was not asked of you.

636
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:38,064
Indeed, it was the only thing
specifically forbidden of you.

637
00:51:38,155 --> 00:51:40,715
By ignoring what we agreed,

638
00:51:40,755 --> 00:51:43,986
you have driven yourself
out of paradise.

639
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:47,065
Out of paradise?

640
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:49,423
Well, yes.
For what is your role now?

641
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:53,826
I had not intended to love Celia.
I do not know how it happened.

642
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:56,633
It happened because
you allowed it to happen.

643
00:51:56,714 --> 00:52:00,023
By trying to be the thing that you were
charged with pretending to be,

644
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:02,951
you have rendered yourself
useless to me.

645
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:05,985
I'm taking Bidnold from you.

646
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:13,787
What'll I do?

647
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:17,142
Hmm. What did you do before?

648
00:52:17,192 --> 00:52:20,820
I was... I worked
as a physician.

649
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:23,300
Ah, yes.
In the hospital.

650
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,951
Well, you can use
that skill again.

651
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:29,824
-I cannot!
-Why not, Merivel?

652
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,980
Because I'm afraid.

653
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,308
Precisely.
So, au revoir, Merivel.

654
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,819
I shall not say adieu,
for who knows,

655
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,663
perhaps in the future, history may have
another role for you.

656
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:49,312
Your Majesty, you took me
from the Royal College,

657
00:52:49,362 --> 00:52:52,161
gave me your dogs to look after,

658
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:54,739
liked me for my foolishness.

659
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:56,739
No, Merivel.

660
00:52:58,868 --> 00:53:01,062
I liked you for your skill,

661
00:53:01,107 --> 00:53:03,462
for then the two were in you...
light and dark.

662
00:53:03,507 --> 00:53:05,862
But now, your skill
is fallen away...

663
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:09,496
and you are one foolish,
quivering mass.

664
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:14,861
The plague is coming,
Merivel,

665
00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:18,097
and the plague rouses men
from their sleep.

666
00:53:44,143 --> 00:53:46,611
You know, Will,
in my time at Bidnold...

667
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:50,173
I have grown
uncommonly fond of you.

668
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:54,778
And I... if I may say so, sir...
am uncommonly fond of you.

669
00:53:54,862 --> 00:53:58,696
So you're off to Mr. Pearce
and the Quakers, sir?

670
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:00,898
I've nowhere else to go.

671
00:54:33,419 --> 00:54:36,296
Ah! How may I
help you, friend?

672
00:54:36,378 --> 00:54:39,211
I-I've come to visit
my friend, Pearce.

673
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:41,898
You must be Robert.

674
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,889
Please, enter.

675
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:50,648
Daniel!

676
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:54,810
Ah, John told us one day
you would like to join us.

677
00:54:54,897 --> 00:54:58,366
-Ah, did he?
-Get some oats for the horse.

678
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:00,452
I do not intend
staying long.

679
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:02,500
I hate being housed up
anywhere for too long, sir.

680
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,751
Robert!

681
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:07,925
Robert!

682
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:10,535
Pearce! Pearce!

683
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:13,732
-John.
-John?

684
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:16,329
Here in Whittlesea,
I'm John and you're Robert.

685
00:55:16,415 --> 00:55:20,123
I'm bound, after all these years,
to find that difficult.

686
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:24,844
Come on. Let's get you out of the wet
and up to your room.

687
00:55:24,894 --> 00:55:28,249
It's the size
of one of my linen cupboards.

688
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:31,052
Here we give prominence
to other things, Robert.

689
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:34,842
When I saw your life before among the
terrible luxuries of the courts, I, uh...

690
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:38,288
well, I prayed you
would be taken out of it.

691
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:43,762
And yet I was uncommonly
fond of it, Pearce.

692
00:55:45,732 --> 00:55:47,802
This is our new
friend Robert.

693
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:49,927
This is Ambrose,

694
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:51,922
Daniel...

695
00:55:51,971 --> 00:55:54,041
and our dear sisters,

696
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:56,850
Hannah and Eleanor.

697
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:59,006
Robert is well qualified
to help us.

698
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,082
He claims to have forgotten
medicine, but I know he has not.

699
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,604
-I have. Sadly, I have.
-Not.

700
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,118
-Well, regrettably, but in fact...
-Stop it.

701
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,282
Lord, send a light
to show Robert the way.

702
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:14,924
Dear Jesus, be with Robert.

703
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:18,445
God in heaven,
take Robert's hand.

704
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:20,604
Be at his side.

705
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:23,964
And even when night comes,
still be at his side.

706
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,482
Amen.

707
00:56:27,808 --> 00:56:31,083
The inmates are looked after
in a series of barns.

708
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:33,277
This is the men's barn.

709
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:37,081
And in the women's barn, the
invalid friends weave sailcloth.

710
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:44,674
The keepers must never
enter the barns alone.

711
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:47,075
Yes, I certainly
understand.

712
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:49,202
This is alarming.

713
00:56:49,286 --> 00:56:51,197
This is our work now.

714
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:53,845
But how has madness
undone so many?

715
00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:55,836
By a hundred different ways.

716
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:58,075
Madness is a brother
and sister to misfortune.

717
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:00,878
Poverty and abandonment
are prime causes.

718
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:04,843
This is Robert!
He's come to help us in our work.

719
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:07,040
Say the name to yourselves...

720
00:57:07,084 --> 00:57:10,394
and keep it precious
because he is your friend.

721
00:57:10,484 --> 00:57:12,315
-Robert.
-Robert.

722
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:15,998
We have one here, a young
Irish woman... Katharine.

723
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:19,632
She was abandoned one night
by her husband.

724
00:57:19,683 --> 00:57:21,913
And now,
she will not sleep.

725
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:24,562
Are you another man
sent to do me injustice?

726
00:57:26,002 --> 00:57:29,551
Katharine, this is our new friend
Robert. He won't hurt you.

727
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:39,924
Red may now, having passed
under the hoop,

728
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:41,580
endeavor to roquet black.

729
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,913
May we not play
a little croquet here, Robert?

730
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,111
Um. No. No. The sight
of a croquet hoop...

731
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,119
would produce in John
a most extraordinary reaction.

732
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,270
What is she doing?

733
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,395
She calls it her leaving step.

734
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:05,275
That's some kind of dance?

735
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:09,269
-Hello, Robert.
-Hello.

736
00:58:11,678 --> 00:58:14,909
Every man on earth
has his leaving step.

737
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:17,915
If my husband had been
a small man,

738
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,868
he would not have been
able to leave.

739
00:58:19,957 --> 00:58:23,836
He was a large man.
Stepped over me as I slept,

740
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,714
in one giant stride.

741
00:58:29,192 --> 00:58:31,221
The king, too, being plagued by fools

742
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:33,424
from whom he wishes to walk away,

743
00:58:33,474 --> 00:58:35,626
has perfected his leaving step

744
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:37,627
to a walk of unsurpassed elegance.

745
00:58:39,835 --> 00:58:42,144
Show me then that walk.

746
00:58:44,475 --> 00:58:46,864
Um...

747
00:58:46,954 --> 00:58:48,785
Well, sort of...

748
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:54,791
Uh... I cannot.

749
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:58,269
My imitation is too poor.
The shoes are all wrong and, uh...

750
00:58:58,313 --> 00:59:01,988
But you, too, are a man.
Have you not your own leaving step?

751
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:04,831
No. It is others
who leave me.

752
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:14,070
Lunacy is a devilish liquid thing.

753
00:59:14,152 --> 00:59:19,430
It can only be coaxed out
by blood, vomit or feces.

754
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:22,105
Do you not smell
the choler?

755
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,147
See. She's quiet now.

756
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:27,229
Of course. She's lost
a lot of blood.

757
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,264
Do you honestly believe that
the bleeding is necessary?

758
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,864
I hope to make her sleep.
Sleep is the best thing for her.

759
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,780
Is there not
some other way?

760
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:42,258
Robert, you've not seen
the nature of her madness.

761
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:45,506
She marches up and down at night,
shouting and crying.

762
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:48,945
-What does she shout?
-That she is not mad.

763
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:51,058
Perhaps she is not mad.

764
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:54,498
On two occasions she tried
to take her own life.

765
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:56,744
Mightn't that be despair?

766
00:59:56,788 --> 01:00:00,541
What you and I would feel
were we locked away with the mad.

767
01:00:05,387 --> 01:00:07,696
Why do you tear
your clothes?

768
01:00:09,507 --> 01:00:12,418
I'm making windows
for my limbs to see through.

769
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:15,976
Clothes make me blind and I must
be watchful at all times,

770
01:00:16,026 --> 01:00:18,699
lest someone come
to hurt me again.

771
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:22,255
This is for you.
The robe of sleep.

772
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,661
To comfort you,
as you comfort your doll.

773
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,299
Robert.

774
01:00:28,385 --> 01:00:30,455
I shall be along shortly.

775
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:48,379
Why are you afraid
to sleep?

776
01:00:51,263 --> 01:00:54,254
Once I fell asleep,

777
01:00:54,382 --> 01:00:56,532
but the evil in me was wakeful.

778
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:58,499
And I let slip my little girl.

779
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:00,931
Your daughter?

780
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:08,413
My man was an English soldier.
One of Cromwell's.

781
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:12,733
He was good to my family.

782
01:01:12,821 --> 01:01:15,254
And I was green as a goose.

783
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,252
And fair looking.

784
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,851
It was he who took
you to London?

785
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,133
A little girl was born to us and lived
three years before she was taken.

786
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,328
She liked to see the boats.

787
01:01:36,058 --> 01:01:38,253
We watched the river
and the river watched us...

788
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:41,449
until one day
I closed my eyes...

789
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:44,331
and the river took her
for drownin'.

790
01:01:46,017 --> 01:01:48,167
You must be watchful
always, Robert.

791
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:52,655
Do not sleep.

792
01:01:52,737 --> 01:01:55,934
We will be watchful
for each other.

793
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:58,206
You can sleep.
I will take the first watch.

794
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:02,167
I cannot.

795
01:02:15,215 --> 01:02:18,604
Across the sea,
in the Land of Mar...

796
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,607
there is a valley where are kept
all the things lost on earth.

797
01:02:25,734 --> 01:02:28,531
Lost kingdoms,
lost riches,

798
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:31,730
lost hours,
lost loves.

799
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:36,689
The people go there to discover
their lost days and lost deeds.

800
01:02:44,692 --> 01:02:48,526
And often they are surprised
to come across a few of their lost wits.

801
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:53,928
Simply because they'd never
in the least missed them.

802
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:11,078
Robert, if you're seen to be
overattentive to one,

803
01:03:11,129 --> 01:03:14,121
you'll be seen to be less than attentive
to the others.

804
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:16,763
I helped her to sleep.
So perhaps I was near a cure for her.

805
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:18,601
That is somewhat arrogant.

806
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:21,964
Cures are not performed by us.
Only Jesus cures.

807
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,879
We are merely His agents.

808
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:27,747
But may we not, as His agents,
look to ourselves?

809
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:30,627
To our own experience
to aid in a cure?

810
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,925
When I am ill,
I will seek out...

811
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:37,362
at the first sign or footstep
of that illness...

812
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:41,325
the services of a physician
to help me to a cure.

813
01:03:41,406 --> 01:03:44,565
And the insane man,
on the contrary, is not brought

814
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:47,413
to any bedlam or hospital until
the disease is far advanced.

815
01:03:50,046 --> 01:03:53,435
For all our inmates
there was a time before.

816
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:55,402
When there was
no madness in them.

817
01:03:55,485 --> 01:03:59,842
We should try to ask each
one of those in our care...

818
01:03:59,885 --> 01:04:02,956
to try to remember how it was
to be in the time before.

819
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:05,154
And to return them there.

820
01:04:05,244 --> 01:04:08,475
Perhaps as sleep returns
Katharine to her time before,

821
01:04:08,564 --> 01:04:10,475
in times of joy,

822
01:04:10,604 --> 01:04:15,757
and in this way
we might discover...

823
01:04:15,843 --> 01:04:18,960
the imprint of the steps
to madness.

824
01:04:19,043 --> 01:04:22,592
There, just
under the surface,

825
01:04:22,643 --> 01:04:25,952
there could be cures
by dancing and laughter.

826
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,873
I see Daniel playing
a tarantella.

827
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:29,793
I see the women dancing
like happy children.

828
01:04:29,882 --> 01:04:32,680
I see... I see...

829
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:38,919
all the things lost on earth.

830
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,037
Robert!

831
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:43,077
This is not
the Court Masque.

832
01:04:43,161 --> 01:04:45,469
I know that!

833
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,899
But you cannot banish joy,

834
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,627
for that is the road to madness.

835
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:54,392
And, and all this...

836
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,475
has come to me
from the Lord...

837
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:00,470
I suspect.

838
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:08,993
Today, instead of walking round
the tree, we're gonna dance.

839
01:05:09,078 --> 01:05:12,627
Or skip. Or gallop.
Anything.

840
01:05:12,718 --> 01:05:15,914
And your keepers
will dance with you.

841
01:05:18,317 --> 01:05:21,229
Um, this is
a twirling dance...

842
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,866
so why do you not twirl
and turn and dance?

843
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,951
Hello, Robert.

844
01:06:14,752 --> 01:06:17,391
One, two and three and four.

845
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,062
Yes! Yes!

846
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,142
Ha ha!

847
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:46,460
-Dance with me!
-Oh, I cannot.

848
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:48,665
Robert cannot, for he is the music.

849
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:50,943
Perhaps, uh, John will ask you
to dance with him.

850
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:16,777
Come on!

851
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:23,335
Why was this music
not always with us?

852
01:07:31,065 --> 01:07:32,941
Aha!

853
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:45,417
John?

854
01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:55,812
John.

855
01:07:57,382 --> 01:07:59,259
Robert.

856
01:07:59,302 --> 01:08:02,578
For a month now,

857
01:08:02,622 --> 01:08:05,772
and I'm telling this
to you and nobody else,

858
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:08,216
I've felt certain symptoms
come upon me.

859
01:08:11,101 --> 01:08:12,978
First, you must rest.

860
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:14,891
Only then, Pearce,
can I prescribe my remedy.

861
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,811
-John.
-Ah, John, then,

862
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,494
but you'll be neither one nor the other
if you allow yourself to die.

863
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,491
I cannot stay in bed,
there's so much work to do...

864
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,451
Please do not make me
lose my temper!

865
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:26,412
Have I not a hundred times since
we've met allowed you to command me...

866
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:28,376
and done this or that
thing at your bidding?

867
01:08:28,419 --> 01:08:30,694
I have. So do not even consider
contradicting me!

868
01:08:40,058 --> 01:08:41,889
What do you prescribe?

869
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:49,325
Syrup of roses to warm your blood
and soothe your coughing.

870
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:51,732
A burdock poultice
for your head.

871
01:08:51,777 --> 01:08:55,452
-And for the slime in the lung?
-Sal ammoniac.

872
01:08:55,537 --> 01:08:57,367
And a balsam.

873
01:08:57,456 --> 01:09:01,574
Yes, we shall try several dissolved
in boiling water and inhaled.

874
01:09:01,656 --> 01:09:06,172
It's all come back
to you then, Robert?

875
01:09:06,256 --> 01:09:09,053
The right knowledge
at the right time.

876
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,524
Perhaps.
We shall see.

877
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:52,129
Tell me more tales
of the Land of Mar.

878
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:59,880
In the woods there lived
great families of badger.

879
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:03,047
And people liked to bring
their children there to see them.

880
01:10:16,089 --> 01:10:19,365
The children are always told that if
they are very quiet, they will see them.

881
01:10:22,408 --> 01:10:24,239
As far as I know,

882
01:10:24,328 --> 01:10:26,637
they are never quiet enough.

883
01:11:01,045 --> 01:11:03,797
This shall be
our meeting place.

884
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,762
Yes.

885
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,681
And I'll wait for ya.

886
01:11:13,763 --> 01:11:16,641
And you'll come to me.

887
01:11:16,723 --> 01:11:18,554
I will.

888
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,629
Merivel?

889
01:11:42,681 --> 01:11:44,512
Why had you go out?

890
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:47,239
Oh, when I cannot sleep,
sometimes I walk...

891
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,151
in the air at night.

892
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,791
Let's see.

893
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:00,990
Hmm.

894
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:02,916
You're burning up.

895
01:12:07,278 --> 01:12:09,109
You called me Merivel.

896
01:12:10,838 --> 01:12:14,353
Since this fever I've...

897
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:17,190
I've forgotten
your other name.

898
01:12:17,277 --> 01:12:19,108
Robert.

899
01:12:19,197 --> 01:12:21,506
Robert. That's it.

900
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:29,549
What I do remember is...

901
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:33,305
how I witnessed
the beating heart.

902
01:12:33,356 --> 01:12:35,233
Yes, I remember.

903
01:12:36,596 --> 01:12:39,792
You put your hand in
and touched it, but I could not.

904
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:43,065
I remember.

905
01:12:45,315 --> 01:12:47,624
And yet the man
felt nothing.

906
01:12:48,794 --> 01:12:50,625
No, he felt nothing.

907
01:12:55,154 --> 01:12:58,429
Pray for me that I might become
that man and feel no pain.

908
01:12:59,753 --> 01:13:02,347
I shall.

909
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,622
It is not
the plague then?

910
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:16,182
No. It's his lung.
A potent consumption.

911
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:20,150
Let us pray for our friend John
in his time of trouble...

912
01:13:20,231 --> 01:13:23,303
that his pain
may be the less.

913
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:42,540
Stay with me.

914
01:13:45,309 --> 01:13:48,506
The pain is less
when you stay with me.

915
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,539
Blessed be the name of the Lord...

916
01:13:58,628 --> 01:14:01,585
from this time forth
and forever more.

917
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,623
From the rising
of the sun...

918
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,942
and the going down
of the same,

919
01:14:06,027 --> 01:14:09,224
the Lord's name
is to be praised.

920
01:14:09,307 --> 01:14:14,300
It troubles me to take with me
to my grave so much that I do not know.

921
01:14:14,386 --> 01:14:18,095
I'd rather you did not talk
about the grave, John.

922
01:14:18,186 --> 01:14:20,984
Of course you would.

923
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:23,420
There are many matters,
ever since I met you,

924
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:27,259
upon which you would prefer me
to remain silent.

925
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,296
But it has
never been my way.

926
01:14:36,584 --> 01:14:38,415
Here.

927
01:14:43,743 --> 01:14:46,303
Your copy of Harvey.

928
01:14:46,423 --> 01:14:49,859
You have a gift,
Merivel. Use it.

929
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:52,173
Robert!

930
01:14:53,942 --> 01:15:01,456
Robert!

931
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:06,860
Robert is my lover!

932
01:15:06,941 --> 01:15:08,772
Robert!

933
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:12,410
He is my lover!

934
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:17,331
Robert!

935
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,179
He is my lover!

936
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:34,458
Farewell, my friend.

937
01:15:52,537 --> 01:15:57,326
When the time is right,
Robert shall leave us.

938
01:15:57,456 --> 01:15:59,412
And he will take
Katharine with him.

939
01:15:59,496 --> 01:16:01,327
Why?

940
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:04,214
Because, Daniel,
she is carrying his child.

941
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:19,488
-Good-bye, Hannah.
-Good-bye, Robert.

942
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:22,134
-Good-bye, Ambrose.
-Good-bye, Robert.

943
01:16:24,094 --> 01:16:25,925
Walk on.

944
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:43,725
He will never teach
me croquet now.

945
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:55,247
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

946
01:16:55,371 --> 01:16:59,125
To see a fine lady
ride on her white horse

947
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:02,964
With rings on her fingers
and bells on her toes

948
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,927
And she shall have
music wherever...

949
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:07,165
Are you content now?

950
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,605
Why should I not be?

951
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:12,487
Will you be Quakerish
all the way to London?

952
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:17,963
You know, in Ireland,
a man with a horse, a cart,

953
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:21,125
and a book he knows how to read
is the catch of the county.

954
01:17:21,168 --> 01:17:23,318
Well, perhaps when we have
made fire of the cart,

955
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:26,286
and eaten the horse,
wiped our asses with the book,

956
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:29,206
you'll have become acquainted
with what you have caught.

957
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,798
Oy! Hop it!

958
01:17:41,887 --> 01:17:44,400
Find the lady.

959
01:17:44,486 --> 01:17:48,274
She's here, she's there,
you seek her everywhere.

960
01:17:48,366 --> 01:17:50,641
She's floating in the air.

961
01:17:50,686 --> 01:17:52,994
Where is she?
Find the lady.

962
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,796
That was my sixpence
if I had played.

963
01:17:59,845 --> 01:18:03,314
-Here is our chance of money.
-Here's your chance

964
01:18:03,404 --> 01:18:05,838
-to be shorn like a sheep.
-Ho, fellow!

965
01:18:05,924 --> 01:18:07,880
Move on or you'll
lose your breeches.

966
01:18:07,964 --> 01:18:11,593
Thank you, but I'm not one
of your bog-dwelling Irish bumpkins.

967
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:14,282
I have had some traffic
with the affairs of men.

968
01:18:14,363 --> 01:18:16,240
We must have money.

969
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:19,440
There's money
inside my skirt.

970
01:18:19,483 --> 01:18:21,394
Sarah!

971
01:18:21,483 --> 01:18:23,713
She is simple.

972
01:18:26,082 --> 01:18:27,913
We are doctor
and patient.

973
01:18:30,322 --> 01:18:32,392
I am the doctor.

974
01:18:32,482 --> 01:18:34,359
Show me the cards.

975
01:18:38,161 --> 01:18:39,958
Find the lady.

976
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,119
I have lost everything.

977
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:58,198
Not quite everything, sir.

978
01:18:58,279 --> 01:19:00,554
I cannot. That was
a gift from the King.

979
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:03,949
Pity.

980
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:11,109
Once more.

981
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:15,069
"Sir Robert Merivel.

982
01:19:15,158 --> 01:19:17,625
Master of Bidnold".

983
01:19:17,717 --> 01:19:19,753
Show me the cards.

984
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:22,516
Find the lady.

985
01:19:22,597 --> 01:19:25,873
She's here, she's there,
she's floating in the air.

986
01:19:25,957 --> 01:19:27,787
Find the lady.

987
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:32,267
Nooo!

988
01:19:35,116 --> 01:19:37,868
Oh, I've made her mad again.

989
01:19:40,795 --> 01:19:42,945
Ah, gold!

990
01:19:44,195 --> 01:19:47,426
Heavy as a hen egg
against everything he's lost.

991
01:19:47,475 --> 01:19:50,671
-And breakfast.
-She's simple.

992
01:19:50,754 --> 01:19:53,826
It's gold.
Even-Stevens, then.

993
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:55,751
And breakfast.

994
01:19:55,794 --> 01:19:58,262
Oh, shame. To rob
an idiot girl.

995
01:19:58,314 --> 01:20:00,190
That's not kind, Robert.

996
01:20:00,233 --> 01:20:02,110
Find the lady.

997
01:20:08,953 --> 01:20:10,908
No!

998
01:20:12,752 --> 01:20:15,266
Ha!

999
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:23,462
But, how?

1000
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:26,270
Simple.

1001
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:31,228
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

1002
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:34,899
To see a fine lady
ride on her white horse

1003
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:39,029
With rings on her fingers
and bells on her toes

1004
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:43,028
She shall have music
wherever she goes

1005
01:21:33,265 --> 01:21:35,095
Hello?

1006
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:43,695
Hello?

1007
01:21:43,784 --> 01:21:45,614
Hello!

1008
01:21:55,302 --> 01:21:57,179
I once lived here.

1009
01:22:04,062 --> 01:22:06,370
Put your hand
on my belly.

1010
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,175
I'm frightened that something
might happen to take it away.

1011
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,970
We'll build him a big strong castle
in the Land of Mar,

1012
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,574
and put him in a high tower
where he will be safe.

1013
01:22:26,979 --> 01:22:30,449
Where he will feel
none of the unkindness of the world;

1014
01:22:30,499 --> 01:22:33,536
scheming, ugliness.

1015
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:36,417
And should he pass
through the valley of lost things,

1016
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:38,887
nothing of him
will ever be lost.

1017
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:43,857
And we shall
call him John.

1018
01:22:45,218 --> 01:22:48,732
No one will ever be able
to take him from you.

1019
01:22:58,016 --> 01:23:00,325
Do not enter, sir.

1020
01:23:03,016 --> 01:23:04,847
I've come looking for work.

1021
01:23:04,936 --> 01:23:07,291
I, uh, I attended the college.

1022
01:23:07,376 --> 01:23:10,606
That ward is struck, and once a ward
or a house is struck,

1023
01:23:10,655 --> 01:23:14,170
then all the people
therein are quarantined for 40 days.

1024
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:18,572
-Both sick and well?
-Both together.

1025
01:23:18,654 --> 01:23:20,485
What happens?

1026
01:23:20,574 --> 01:23:24,044
We leave them.
Mostly they die.

1027
01:23:28,014 --> 01:23:30,122
-What about the physicians?
-All fled.

1028
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,766
Physicians have become
the men most despised.

1029
01:23:36,853 --> 01:23:38,684
Perhaps you'd
like that, sir.

1030
01:23:38,773 --> 01:23:42,606
Physicians used to wear them
to purify the air against the plague.

1031
01:23:42,652 --> 01:23:45,371
Well, you can keep it.

1032
01:23:45,452 --> 01:23:48,967
The physician who wore it
comes here no more.

1033
01:23:49,012 --> 01:23:50,842
Nor does he go anywhere.

1034
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:53,769
Nor has breath.

1035
01:24:28,968 --> 01:24:30,799
John.

1036
01:24:52,526 --> 01:24:56,040
You have a gift, Merivel. Use it.

1037
01:25:05,404 --> 01:25:07,281
For the child.

1038
01:25:12,604 --> 01:25:14,912
Why do you stay
with me?

1039
01:25:18,003 --> 01:25:21,598
Because the child has weaved
our lives together.

1040
01:25:21,643 --> 01:25:24,396
I know you don't love me
as you've loved others.

1041
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:31,159
Um, perhaps I do not recognize
love, Katharine. I'm not a wise man.

1042
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,836
In the Land of Mar,

1043
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,599
which lies
just above Africa...

1044
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,073
To help you sleep.

1045
01:25:57,119 --> 01:25:59,155
You must sleep, Robert,

1046
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:02,117
if you are to heal others
as you've healed me.

1047
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:17,949
It's all right.
It's all right.

1048
01:26:29,076 --> 01:26:31,465
We can only
wait and pray.

1049
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:34,826
And then, if she should
start to slip away?

1050
01:26:34,876 --> 01:26:37,709
Then there is only
one thing can be done.

1051
01:26:37,836 --> 01:26:41,953
Katharine. Katharine.

1052
01:26:41,995 --> 01:26:43,872
The baby is large.

1053
01:26:43,915 --> 01:26:46,475
You cannot
push it out of you.

1054
01:26:48,675 --> 01:26:51,347
Is there nothing
can be done to save it?

1055
01:26:51,394 --> 01:26:53,749
I must cut into the womb.

1056
01:26:55,474 --> 01:26:57,829
But if I do,
I shall lose you.

1057
01:26:57,914 --> 01:27:00,711
And I don't want
to lose you, Katharine.

1058
01:27:02,633 --> 01:27:04,783
You must save the child.

1059
01:27:17,992 --> 01:27:19,983
Are you not afraid?

1060
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:22,386
You're leaving me, I fear.

1061
01:27:24,511 --> 01:27:26,388
Nothing else.

1062
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:36,139
Be with me now, Pearce.

1063
01:27:43,269 --> 01:27:45,988
Now, help me.
Hold back the flesh...

1064
01:27:46,069 --> 01:27:48,822
while I gently lever
the child out.

1065
01:27:58,028 --> 01:28:00,781
Ah! Oh! Huh!

1066
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:04,818
Katharine.

1067
01:28:04,907 --> 01:28:08,704
Katharine!

1068
01:28:22,826 --> 01:28:25,134
There's nothing
more I can do.

1069
01:28:26,745 --> 01:28:28,622
Sir!

1070
01:28:31,585 --> 01:28:33,416
Robert.

1071
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:42,496
It is no John,
it is our little girl.

1072
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:48,340
We shall call her Margaret.

1073
01:28:49,343 --> 01:28:51,811
Margaret.

1074
01:28:54,982 --> 01:28:57,780
I love you, Robert.

1075
01:28:57,862 --> 01:28:59,693
I love you.

1076
01:29:05,421 --> 01:29:07,491
Keep her safe.

1077
01:29:07,581 --> 01:29:09,776
I will.

1078
01:29:53,737 --> 01:29:58,093
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

1079
01:29:58,136 --> 01:30:02,288
in sure and certain hope
of resurrection to eternal life...

1080
01:30:02,376 --> 01:30:05,288
the Lord, Jesus Christ
who shall...

1081
01:30:10,855 --> 01:30:12,925
I write this for you, dear Margaret,

1082
01:30:13,015 --> 01:30:15,131
to tell you something
of my life.

1083
01:30:15,255 --> 01:30:17,371
Whatever is good in it
I owe to two people...

1084
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,803
whom I could not save.

1085
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:23,045
Your mother loved you
and gave her life for yours.

1086
01:30:23,094 --> 01:30:25,927
She was the bravest spirit
I ever knew.

1087
01:30:29,613 --> 01:30:33,572
The most compassionate
was my friend John Pearce.

1088
01:30:33,613 --> 01:30:36,889
Now I know I must return
to our work in the hospital,

1089
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:39,771
and take on the role
that was always meant for me.

1090
01:30:39,813 --> 01:30:41,928
I have arranged
for your safekeeping.

1091
01:30:42,012 --> 01:30:45,891
For if I become ill,
I will not return.

1092
01:31:21,689 --> 01:31:23,519
But they are
tied to the bed.

1093
01:31:23,608 --> 01:31:26,441
Those already affected
with the plague are tied...

1094
01:31:26,568 --> 01:31:28,667
to prevent them going into the streets

1095
01:31:28,668 --> 01:31:30,356
like madmen and infecting other people.

1096
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:33,166
But the sick and the well
must be separated.

1097
01:31:33,247 --> 01:31:35,397
Open it!

1098
01:31:35,487 --> 01:31:39,082
I can't, sir.
The proclamation. The plague!

1099
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:40,998
Then I shall open it.

1100
01:32:13,364 --> 01:32:16,275
The sick and
the well they keep quarantined together.

1101
01:32:16,363 --> 01:32:19,833
If I were merely to separate them,
a great many lives would be saved.

1102
01:32:21,923 --> 01:32:24,881
Who do I have to thank
for this kindness?

1103
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:27,277
One John Pearce.

1104
01:32:28,402 --> 01:32:30,279
The sick I can offer no cure.

1105
01:32:30,322 --> 01:32:32,677
But my presence among them
may bring with it some hope.

1106
01:32:34,962 --> 01:32:36,838
Fear is our greatest enemy.

1107
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:39,190
And hope our best weapon
against the disease.

1108
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,195
They have mistaken me
for John Pearce.

1109
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,509
A mistake to which
I have contributed.

1110
01:32:57,599 --> 01:33:00,750
I allow them to continue
to honor my friend.

1111
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:04,156
Dr. Pearce.

1112
01:33:08,358 --> 01:33:10,235
Excellent.

1113
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:19,425
There you are.
Mary will show you out.

1114
01:33:30,636 --> 01:33:32,274
Margaret.

1115
01:33:32,556 --> 01:33:35,354
-Dr. Pearce.
-Who calls?

1116
01:34:20,911 --> 01:34:23,903
Pearce.

1117
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:26,988
I give her
into your hands.

1118
01:34:27,031 --> 01:34:30,262
Call for any medicines.
Anything you deem suitable.

1119
01:35:16,146 --> 01:35:18,341
Why have they sent
another doctor to me?

1120
01:35:18,386 --> 01:35:21,219
You must want to live,
Lady Celia.

1121
01:35:21,266 --> 01:35:23,733
No.

1122
01:35:23,825 --> 01:35:26,180
Not in so wretched a state.

1123
01:35:38,304 --> 01:35:40,260
Tell me, Doctor,

1124
01:35:40,384 --> 01:35:42,261
why is it that
those that we love...

1125
01:35:42,384 --> 01:35:44,215
do not love us
in return?

1126
01:35:46,903 --> 01:35:50,862
I once loved a woman
who did not love me.

1127
01:35:50,903 --> 01:35:53,736
Yet I believed
that she did.

1128
01:35:56,062 --> 01:35:59,532
Is it not
equally possible...

1129
01:35:59,622 --> 01:36:03,376
to mistakenly
feel unloved?

1130
01:36:03,462 --> 01:36:05,196
I am one of many.

1131
01:36:05,197 --> 01:36:08,455
I know no special place
in the King's heart.

1132
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:11,339
The King does love
you, Lady Celia.

1133
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:15,574
Why would he reveal such intimacies
to you and not to me?

1134
01:36:15,701 --> 01:36:19,136
He told me nothing,
but I recognized in him...

1135
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:21,780
the very feelings
I myself have known.

1136
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,810
How may I arrive
at such an understanding?

1137
01:36:28,899 --> 01:36:31,777
I used to look to the constellations
for some explanation...

1138
01:36:31,859 --> 01:36:34,692
in mysterious times
of my own life.

1139
01:36:34,779 --> 01:36:38,373
But the stars hold only
part of the answer, Lady Celia.

1140
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:40,335
Now I look toward myself
and those who believed in me

1141
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,608
and loved me
for the man I was.

1142
01:36:42,658 --> 01:36:45,536
Now I know we have
the power to shape our own destiny.

1143
01:36:45,658 --> 01:36:48,729
Your voice
sounds familiar.

1144
01:36:48,817 --> 01:36:52,492
Perhaps from some other time
in my life, when I was a child.

1145
01:36:52,577 --> 01:36:54,408
Yes.

1146
01:36:54,497 --> 01:36:57,569
Perhaps when
we were children.

1147
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:14,130
Sire, I am familiar with
the many symptoms of the plague.

1148
01:37:14,215 --> 01:37:17,013
Lady Celia suffers
from a different illness, a fever,

1149
01:37:17,095 --> 01:37:19,688
which I have treated
and from which she will recover.

1150
01:37:19,734 --> 01:37:22,328
And something else...
She is with child.

1151
01:37:26,614 --> 01:37:28,809
Good Doctor,

1152
01:37:28,894 --> 01:37:31,361
you have made my heart
exceeding glad.

1153
01:37:31,453 --> 01:37:34,490
But she is still haunted
by a profound melancholy.

1154
01:37:34,573 --> 01:37:38,202
It can be relieved only
by some assurance of love.

1155
01:37:41,532 --> 01:37:43,841
I do believe
I understand you.

1156
01:37:43,892 --> 01:37:46,281
I believe I do.

1157
01:37:46,332 --> 01:37:49,768
And now you must
remove your headdress...

1158
01:37:49,852 --> 01:37:52,285
and make yourself
known to us.

1159
01:37:52,331 --> 01:37:55,320
That, if Your Majesty will
forgive me, I cannot do.

1160
01:37:55,531 --> 01:37:57,886
I only hope
I've proved useful.

1161
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:09,440
A large part of the city
is on fire.

1162
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:14,361
Boatsman!

1163
01:38:25,928 --> 01:38:27,805
Go in!

1164
01:38:27,848 --> 01:38:29,759
All right.

1165
01:38:29,808 --> 01:38:31,844
I must find
my daughter.

1166
01:38:31,928 --> 01:38:34,157
Now, go in closer!

1167
01:38:59,845 --> 01:39:03,281
-Am I not near Cheapside?
-Save yourself, sir.

1168
01:39:03,325 --> 01:39:05,394
Cheapside is gone.

1169
01:39:22,203 --> 01:39:24,842
-Where am I?
-Get away from me!

1170
01:39:24,923 --> 01:39:28,358
-What street is this?
-I don't know!

1171
01:39:28,442 --> 01:39:30,273
Margaret!

1172
01:39:39,601 --> 01:39:42,035
Margaret!

1173
01:40:51,434 --> 01:40:53,311
Someone in there.

1174
01:41:26,231 --> 01:41:31,509
Where am I?

1175
01:41:31,591 --> 01:41:34,866
You have come back
to Bidnold.

1176
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:36,781
Will.

1177
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:42,425
I remember the journey.

1178
01:41:42,509 --> 01:41:44,340
I think not, sir.

1179
01:41:44,429 --> 01:41:47,102
You were asleep
for the most part of it.

1180
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:51,101
They found you
15 miles from here.

1181
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:54,385
Stuck fast under a tree.

1182
01:41:57,996 --> 01:41:59,456
Margaret?

1183
01:41:59,748 --> 01:42:02,785
No word of Margaret?

1184
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,738
Sir?

1185
01:42:07,987 --> 01:42:10,182
I wish you might
have known her, Will.

1186
01:42:10,227 --> 01:42:13,901
I had a little daughter.
A most beautiful little girl.

1187
01:43:03,382 --> 01:43:07,169
I feel as though old age has
come upon me in the space of a moment.

1188
01:43:59,416 --> 01:44:01,293
I fear I'm dreaming.

1189
01:44:01,336 --> 01:44:04,134
No, Merivel.
You are awake.

1190
01:44:08,016 --> 01:44:11,928
-Lady Celia has recovered.
-She was ill, Sire?

1191
01:44:12,015 --> 01:44:14,813
Yes, and I was led to believe
that a colleague of yours,

1192
01:44:14,855 --> 01:44:18,325
a certain John Pearce,
was responsible for her recovery.

1193
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:21,411
However, Celia
thinks differently.

1194
01:44:21,494 --> 01:44:23,564
And her suspicions
were confirmed...

1195
01:44:23,614 --> 01:44:26,174
when a midwife carrying
a very young child...

1196
01:44:26,254 --> 01:44:29,963
came to our palace
in search of one...

1197
01:44:30,014 --> 01:44:31,890
Robert Merivel.

1198
01:44:31,973 --> 01:44:35,249
Your child, I believe.

1199
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:09,361
Merivel.

1200
01:45:15,849 --> 01:45:18,522
I am not mistaken,
am I, Merivel,

1201
01:45:18,609 --> 01:45:21,218
about your love for this place?
-No, Sire.

1202
01:45:21,219 --> 01:45:24,726
There are here in Bidnold
certain combinations of color...

1203
01:45:24,768 --> 01:45:26,963
I do not think exist
anywhere else in the world.

1204
01:45:27,008 --> 01:45:29,568
Yes, quite.

1205
01:45:29,648 --> 01:45:32,082
Yes, your man Gates sent to us
and told us that...

1206
01:45:32,128 --> 01:45:35,164
you had returned
to your house.

1207
01:45:35,247 --> 01:45:37,317
My house, Sire?

1208
01:45:37,407 --> 01:45:39,238
Yes.

1209
01:45:39,327 --> 01:45:41,716
I am giving you Bidnold...

1210
01:45:41,807 --> 01:45:45,481
until my reign is over
and another age comes.

1211
01:45:45,566 --> 01:45:48,797
What was taken from you
is restored to you...

1212
01:45:48,846 --> 01:45:51,963
in return for the lives
you've saved...

1213
01:45:52,046 --> 01:45:54,718
and the man that
you have become.

1214
01:45:55,765 --> 01:45:58,074
It is your house, Merivel.

1215
01:45:58,165 --> 01:46:00,474
And I shall never
take it from you.

1216
01:46:06,164 --> 01:46:09,110
And I have commissioned
a portrait of you.

1217
01:46:12,684 --> 01:46:15,516
And it shall be called
"A Physician".

1218
01:46:20,163 --> 01:46:23,473
The fire in its
fury has consumed the great plague.

1219
01:46:23,563 --> 01:46:26,201
Misfortune may leave behind
unlooked-for blessings,

1220
01:46:26,282 --> 01:46:28,842
none dearer than you,
my little Margaret.

1221
01:46:32,202 --> 01:46:35,399
I will return to the city
to my work as a doctor,

1222
01:46:35,442 --> 01:46:38,478
and the rebuilding
of the King's hospital.

1223
01:46:38,561 --> 01:46:40,392
The stars that
once confused me...

1224
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:43,041
seem now to light a path
that is clear,

1225
01:46:43,081 --> 01:46:45,914
that I have in truth been traveling
for all these days.

1226
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,339
Where I met what came

1227
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,152
and left behind my sorrows.

1228
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,509
And I'm traveling still.

1229
01:47:03,478 --> 01:47:07,649
