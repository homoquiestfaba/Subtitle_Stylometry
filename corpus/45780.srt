00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:13,826
[Man Narrating]
Listen, here's the thing.

2
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:18,766
If you can't spot the sucker
in your first half hour at the table,

3
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:21,099
then you are the sucker.

4
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:32,012
Guys around here'll tell ya...
you play for a living.

5
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:36,109
It's like any other job.
You don't gamble. You grind it out.

6
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:40,452
Your goal is to win
one big bet an hour, that's it.

7
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:43,788
Get your money in when you have the best
of it, and protect it when you don't.

8
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,851
Don't give anything away.

9
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,762
That's how I've paid my way
through half of law school.

10
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:52,290
A true grinder.

11
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:57,306
See, I learned how to win a little at
a time. But finally, I've learned this...

12
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:01,868
If you're too careful, your
whole life can become a fuckin' grind.

13
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:13,917
This is Teddy KGB's place.

14
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,585
- [Man] Five hundred.
- You won't find it in the Yellow Pages.

15
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,822
Nope.
Not tonight.

16
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,830
No? What?

17
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:28,036
Give me three stacks
of high society.

18
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:46,285
Thirty thousand.
Count it.

19
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:57,332
- That's good.
- So, you're sitting the apple.

20
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,494
- Good. Want a cookie?
- No.

21
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,772
[Narrating]
He doesn't look like much,

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,537
but KGB is connected all the way
to the top of the Russian mob.

23
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,602
He's the one guy in the game
you don't want to fuck with.

24
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,944
But if you're looking
for high stakes,

25
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,007
this is the only place
in town.

26
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:18,680
They all know me as a small-timer,
but that's about to change.

27
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:28,453
Joey Knish
is a New York legend.

28
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:31,329
He's been a rounder,
earning his living at cards...

29
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:33,995
since he was 19 years old.

30
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,504
What are you,
holdin' those for somebody?

31
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:39,940
Uh, yeah,
I'm holding 'em for you.

32
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:41,977
- You should be.
- [Chuckles]

33
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:44,843
'Cause I hope you're not thinking
of putting all that glimmer in play.

34
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:48,213
[Narrating] He's as close to a friend
as there is in this place.

35
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:51,185
- Come here.
- [Narrator] But tonight,
I don't want to see him.

36
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,518
Now, you don't wanna
butt onions with these guys.

37
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,718
'Cause they'll chew you up,
take your whole bankroll.

38
00:03:58,228 --> 00:04:00,594
- So you say.
- There's plenty of easy games.

39
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:03,894
We get outta here, get some coffee,
ride over to that soft seat in Queens.

40
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,367
I know what I'm doing.

41
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:11,435
You're making a run at it,
aren't you?

42
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:14,068
Rolling up a stake
and going to Vegas.

43
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:17,636
I'm right, right?

44
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,875
- I can beat the game.
- Maybe.

45
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,440
Maybe this is a game
can be beat.

46
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,317
But you know you can beat the 10-20
at the Chesterfield and the Hi-Low...

47
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:27,788
at that goulash joint
on 79th Street.

48
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:33,125
Okay.
I understand.

49
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:39,028
I understand.
Back to battle.

50
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:44,772
[Narrating] The game in question is
No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em.

51
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:47,571
Minimum buy-in $25,000.

52
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:51,011
A game like this doesn't come together
often outside the casinos.

53
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,207
The stakes attract
rich flounders,

54
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,717
and they in turn
attract the sharks.

55
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:04,053
No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em
is the Cadillac of poker.

56
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,563
Each player is dealt
two cards face down.

57
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,793
Five cards are then dealt
face up across the middle.

58
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:14,325
These are community cards everyone can
use to make the best five card hand.

59
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,772
The key to the game is playing
the man, not the cards.

60
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:21,276
Bet an eight ball.

61
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:27,576
There's no other game in which fortunes
can change so much from hand to hand.

62
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,847
A brilliant player can get
a strong hand cracked, go on tilt...

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,889
and lose his mind along with
every single chip in front of him.

64
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:38,087
This is why the World Series of Poker is
decided over a No-Limit Hold 'Em table.

65
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,823
Some people, pros even,
won't play No-Limit.

66
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:43,195
They can't handle
the swings.

67
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,967
But there are others,
like Doyle Brunson,

68
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:50,096
who consider No-Limit
the only pure game left.

69
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:57,771
Like Papa Wallenda said..."Life is on
the wire. The rest is just waiting."

70
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,315
Pass it to you.

71
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,753
All right, I raise.

72
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:08,655
- I'm gonna raise five hundred.
- [Man] Fold.

73
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,160
It's a position raise.
I call it.

74
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,466
[Narrating]
Here's the beauty of this game.

75
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:26,471
- Go ahead.
- [Narrating] I just got
top two pair on the flop,

76
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,511
and I want to keep him
in the hand.

77
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:31,979
Against your average guy,
I'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.

78
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:35,040
Let him walk into it.
But KGB's too smart for that.

79
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:37,951
So, what I've got to do
is over-bet the pot,

80
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:40,114
make it look like
I'm trying to buy it.

81
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:44,489
- I bet $2,000.
- Then he plays back at me,
and I get paid off.

82
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:18,358
Call.

83
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:21,693
[Narrating]
My guess is Teddy's on a flush draw.

84
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,357
Burn and turn.

85
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,104
[Narrating]
There's my money card, nine of hearts.

86
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:31,197
I got a full house.

87
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,608
- To the bettor.
- Check's good.

88
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:39,444
[Narrating] Now I hope
a spade falls and Teddy makes his flush.

89
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:43,542
That way he'll bet strong, and I'll beat
him with my nines full over aces.

90
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,454
I'm going to bet...

91
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:55,964
Bet...

92
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:59,058
$15,000.

93
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,638
Time.

94
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,409
[Narrating] I want him to think
that I'm pondering a call,

95
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,347
but all I'm really thinking about
is Vegas and the fucking Mirage.

96
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:32,357
All right, your 15, plus
I have another 33 to raise you.

97
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:34,369
Um...

98
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:42,204
Yeah, I'm gonna go all in, 'cause
I don't think you got the spades.

99
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:49,849
You are right.
I don't have spades.

100
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:58,151
[Narrating] I know before
the cards are even turned over.

101
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:05,392
Aces full, Mike.

102
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,698
Get up.

103
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:41,636
Come on.
Come on.

104
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:49,570
- Want some?
- No.

105
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:52,808
I'm down to the felt, Knish.
I lost everything.

106
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:57,046
Man, I lost my case money.
I lost my tuition.

107
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:02,216
It happens to everyone.
Time to time, everyone goes bust.

108
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,351
You'll be back in the game
before you know it.

109
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,488
I'm done.
I'm out of it.

110
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,055
They all say that
at first.

111
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:14,297
Hey, man, let me stake you.
Standard deal, you know.

112
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,636
Fifty percent of your winnings.
If you lose, it's on me.

113
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,604
I'd just throw it away.

114
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:29,139
- You still got the truck?
- Sure.

115
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:31,152
Come on.

116
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:49,594
[Mike Narrating] You don't hear much
about guys who take their shot and miss,

117
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:51,936
but I'll tell you
what happens to 'em.

118
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,875
They end up humping crappy jobs
on graveyard shifts,

119
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:57,970
trying to figure out
how they came up short.

120
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,710
See, I had this picture
in my head.

121
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:04,776
Me sitting at the big table,
Doyle to my left,

122
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:09,348
Amarillo Slim to my right,
playing in the World Series of Poker.

123
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:13,759
And I let that vision
blind me at the table against KGB.

124
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,663
Now, the closest I get
to Vegas is west New York,

125
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:19,292
driving this lousy route
handed down from Knish...

126
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:22,667
to rounders who forget
the cardinal fuckin' rule...

127
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:24,706
Always leave yourself outs.

128
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:27,265
- Hey, Moogie.
- Let me ask you a question.

129
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:30,835
In a legal sense, can fuckin'
Steinbrenner just move the Yankees?

130
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:33,541
Does he have the fuckin' right
to just move them?

131
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:36,346
I don't know.
How should I know that?

132
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,378
- You didn't learn that yet?
- No, we get to Steinbrenner
in the third year of law school.

133
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:43,220
Oh.

134
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:47,490
- Take care, man.
- Yeah.

135
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:59,370
- [Chattering]
- [Poker Chips Clattering]

136
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,342
[Mike Narrating]
The judges' game.

137
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,540
I'd heard about it for years on the
street, before I was even in law school.

138
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:09,244
A rotating group of ten or twelve
judges, prosecutors and professors.

139
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,752
They all have money,
and in my playing days...

140
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:15,279
it would have been pretty sweet to have
any one of them owing me favors.

141
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,918
Only problem is, no one
can get in the game anymore.

142
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:22,021
One rounder, Crispy Linetta,
sat under some pretense,

143
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:26,592
but they found out he was a pro,
he couldn't cross the street
without a legal hassle.

144
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:29,536
Even his regular club,
Vorshay's, got shut down.

145
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,540
Place had been open
since 1907.

146
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,508
Oh, Michael.

147
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:37,239
- You got some things for me?
- Yes, I do.

148
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:39,645
Put 'em on the desk,
it's all right.

149
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,018
Kid, he paying you
for this late night shit?

150
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:46,452
Oh, well, knowledge is
my reward, sir.

151
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,888
- [Chuckles]
- Let me tell you, it ain't worth it.

152
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,256
Why don't you become a jockey,
do something useful.

153
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,091
- [Group Laughs]
- Kid's a little tall, isn't he, Gene?

154
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:57,132
Enough with the Belmont
recruiting spiel. Your bet.

155
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,463
- All right. I call.
- Michael is lead counsel...

156
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,867
in the Moot Court
you're presiding over next week, Gene.

157
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,065
Besides, he could use
the background if he's gonna...

158
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,200
clerk for one of you fellas
this summer, right?

159
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:11,372
Abe, I thought you liked the kid. Why do
you want to make him a civil servant?

160
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:14,848
Yeah, look... a word to the wise.
Stay in the private sector.

161
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:18,876
That Nassau defense attorney's game?
They use our chips for coasters.

162
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,321
[Mike Narrating]
The amazing thing is, in this
collection of great legal minds,

163
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,154
there isn't a single
real card player.

164
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:27,753
- I call.
- Raise.

165
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,957
Um, the professor raises.

166
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:35,268
Mike? [Whispers]
Michael, I would have just called.

167
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,272
No, you're good.

168
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,138
All right, I call.

169
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,769
[Mike Narrating]
I don't know if I'm going to bring
my legal career to a crashing halt...

170
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:47,043
before it even starts,
but I just can't help myself.

171
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:49,084
- Good.
- I'm in.

172
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:51,483
- [Clears Throat]
- Read 'em and weep.

173
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:57,691
Threes check.

174
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:05,357
Check to Martin and Lewis
over there.

175
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:08,426
- Check to the raiser.
- Czechoslovakia.

176
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:12,770
- What's the limit?
- $20. Big bet's $20.

177
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:16,938
Okay. Good.
There's $20.

178
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:21,211
You've seen half a hand. How the
fuck are you betting into us?

179
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:23,877
You sure this is wise, Abe?
It's your money the kid's bettin' with.

180
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:28,322
It's plenty wise.
We know what we're holding,
and we know what you're holding.

181
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,121
[Chuckles]
The fuck you know what we all got.

182
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:34,128
Summer clerkship in your office says
I know what you're holding.

183
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:36,687
I don't bet
with jobs like that.

184
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:40,133
Let's just say I'll put you at the top
of the list if you're right.

185
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:44,138
Okay. [Clears Throat] Well, you
were looking for that third three,

186
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:47,073
but you forgot that Professor Green
folded it on Fourth Street,

187
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,304
and now you're representing
that you have it.

188
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:51,812
The D.A. made his two pair,
but he knows they're no good.

189
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:55,510
Judge Kaplan was trying to squeeze out
a diamond flush, but he came up short,

190
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:57,984
and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping
that his queens are gonna stand up.

191
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:01,387
So, like I said,
the Dean's bet is $20.

192
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:04,392
- Well, kiss my ass.
- Kiss my ass.

193
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,123
[Group Laughs]

194
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:11,223
- What'd you have, Abe?
- Nothin' but a busted straight.

195
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,860
- Oh, come on.
- It's good enough to win. Take it down.

196
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:17,428
All right, kid, your first assignment.
Pull up a seat next to me.

197
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:20,100
Oh, I'd like to. I can't, I can't.
I don't play cards.

198
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:23,771
- Get outta here!
- See you tomorrow.

199
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:26,178
- Whose deal?
- My deal.

200
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:29,012
- I like the kid, Abe.
- Good kid.

201
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,383
Smart kid.

202
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:34,912
[Mike Narrating]
I tell ya, it's hard leaving that game.

203
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,517
An open invitation
to lay with those lambs.

204
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:40,528
But I'm retired.

205
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,728
The truth is, I can always
find games, though.

206
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:49,703
Easy games, tough games, straight games,
crooked games, home games.

207
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:53,936
I can turn this truck onto the Jersey
Turnpike and be at the Taj in two hours.

208
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,311
But I've made promises.

209
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:02,917
I'm just a law student now.

210
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,587
Hello?

211
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,589
- Hey.
- Hey.

212
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,990
- How'd it go?
- Oh, great.

213
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:21,533
[Sighs]
I am sick of that fucking route.

214
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:24,539
Don't worry.
A few more semesters...

215
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,667
Mmm.

216
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,177
Oh, I gotta go.

217
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:33,511
- I'm really late.
- Oh, just stay here.
I'll be really quick.

218
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:36,210
- You won't feel a thing. [Chuckles]
- [Chuckles]

219
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:38,617
We both know
that's not true.

220
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,383
Besides, you should
get some sleep.

221
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,618
These fuckin' long nights
are killing me.

222
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,660
They never used to.

223
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:47,753
Yeah, well, that's different.
I mean, that was like...

224
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,526
buy in at 8:00, next thing
you know it's morning.

225
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:53,693
But hey, you know, I think
I'm hooked up for this summer.

226
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:55,828
Hooked up how?

227
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:59,671
Well, after I left you last night at the
library, I impressed Judge Marinacci.

228
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:01,869
I think I might be in line
for a clerkship.

229
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:06,075
Tell me more.

230
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:09,208
Well, those guys were
all playing cards, and...

231
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,913
Just hear me out now,
hear me out.

232
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:14,922
They were playing cards
and I read his hand blind.

233
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,296
So, instead of coming home, you went
and played cards with some judge?

234
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:24,389
No, I wasn't even playing.
They were playing.

235
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,993
I just caught his eye
by reading his hand, that's all.

236
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:32,871
I mean, as long as I don't fuck
up Moot Court, I think the job's mine.

237
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,938
What kind of job
is that gonna be, Mike?

238
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,538
Writing an opinion
on high-stakes poker?

239
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:43,176
Honey, you're the one
who told me...

240
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:45,846
that I should use my poker skills
in the courtroom.

241
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:48,321
Yeah, I know
I said that, but...

242
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,587
You know what I meant.
I meant that you should use your head.

243
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,824
You know, the way you calculate odds
on the spot, the way you read people.

244
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:59,891
That's what I meant.
I didn't mean that you should try to
con your way into a summer job.

245
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:04,269
- Honey, con? I was networking.
- [Laughs] Oh, God.

246
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,832
Networking. Are you trying
to con me now?

247
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,674
No.

248
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:13,306
I just...
I don't think you get it.

249
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:16,943
You'll be just like one
of those ex-college athletes.

250
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:19,613
You know, great job at the
D.A. 's office as long as...

251
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:22,521
they never miss
a lawyer's league game.

252
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,027
It's true. I just think if you
get in this way,

253
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:28,256
you'll always be
a hustler to them.

254
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,321
Baby, I didn't even play.

255
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:35,199
Okay.

256
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,262
I'll see you later.

257
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,414
Oh.

258
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:50,919
- Hey, hon, can I take
the Jeep tomorrow?
- Yeah, where?

259
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:53,784
Uh, Worm's gettin' out.
I was gonna pick him up.

260
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:56,416
Tomorrow.
Beautiful.

261
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:58,426
I promised
I'd be there, hon.

262
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:02,260
Worm. I just can't believe you
still know someone called "Worm."

263
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:04,299
He's like my brother.

264
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,536
Shit.
I didn't even play.

265
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:14,633
[Mike Narrating] I met Worm
at Dwight Inglewood Preparatory
Academy over in Jersey.

266
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,611
We were the only two kids attending
who didn't have a trust fund.

267
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,843
My father's office was there.
It said "Custodian" on the door.

268
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,441
That's why
they took me.

269
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:29,758
- [Makes Buzzer Sound]
- Pow!

270
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:35,460
W-Was that, like,
your strong finish or something?

271
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:38,364
- Motherfucker!
- You leave me no choice,
the way you play.

272
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:41,198
That's the fourth time you done
played that bitch of spades on my ass.

273
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,670
No, no, no, no, no.

274
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:46,799
Dowling had it three hands ago, and
two hands ago I got the black Maria,

275
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,809
so I don't want to
hear you bitchin', okay?

276
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,641
- Yeah, but he shot the moon
on that hand, didn't he?
- Yeah, I saw that.

277
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:55,878
- So it helped you.
- Now... Okay, you're right.

278
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:58,511
You ain't walking outta here
with our grits, Worm.

279
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:02,045
You know the drill, okay? I'm not
gonna smoke 'em. I'll hold on to 'em.

280
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:05,855
if you want 'em back, you can
trade me for 'em, or try to play
double or nothing tomorrow.

281
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:09,864
Murphy! What the hell you sittin'
there for? You're processed. Come on.

282
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:15,563
Processed? This motherfucker's
gettin' the jump.

283
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:17,935
Come on, man, have
some decency here, Worm.

284
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,940
You can buy all the smokes
you want in half an hour.

285
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:23,671
- What are you talking about?
I won these fair and square.
- You don't even smoke, Worm.

286
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:27,580
Jesus, you guys are such
fuckin' babies. You know that?

287
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:31,551
If you're determined to die
of cancer, you really oughta
learn how to play cards.

288
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,815
Ain't a good idea to add
insult to injury, yo.

289
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:36,483
- That shit will come back and hurt you.
- You know what?

290
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,493
Not in this lifetime.
Enjoy your time.

291
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:44,088
Murphy.

292
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,101
[Mike Narrating] Worm's dad
did the grounds, when he wasn't
too fuckin' drunk.

293
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:49,194
That's when we did 'em.

294
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,466
Of course, the grounds
weren't all we did.

295
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,533
Worm put us into a scam a day
on all the young aristocrats
we went to school with...

296
00:20:55,611 --> 00:21:00,344
selling 'em dime bags
of oregano, nunchakus
and firecrackers from Chinatown.

297
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,044
- Where's the rest?
- Kept us in lunch money.

298
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:09,890
- Thank you.
- Until the time we went for...

299
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,756
more than just pocket change
and got caught.

300
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:16,286
We had the starting five take a dive
against Friends Academy.

301
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:20,096
The point guard snapped
and gave Worm up.

302
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:27,936
They hauled him up before
the school board, offered him a deal.

303
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,070
Tell us who else was involved,
and we'll go easy on you.

304
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:34,604
Worm didn't say a fuckin' word.
Got himself expelled.

305
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:39,885
- I stayed in school and graduated.
- [Guard] Crank the outside.

306
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,889
[Bell Rings]

307
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:47,151
Not many guys would stand up
for a friend like that.

308
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:59,441
- Ta-da!
- [Both Laugh]

309
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:02,102
- Mike McD. God. I knew you'd be here.
- Aw, man.

310
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:05,146
- You never let me down.
- I would have been there
every week if you let me, man.

311
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:08,183
I know, I know. I couldn't
let you see me in this shit hole.

312
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,810
- Look at you. You look great, man.
- You too, you too.

313
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:13,047
- Did they toughen you up in there?
- No, no.

314
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:15,180
It was a piece of cake.
Piece of cake.

315
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:18,715
Man, look at your ride. You've been
prospering while I've been away.

316
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:21,262
- What have you been up to?
- I borrowed it.

317
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,858
Whatever. Just get in it and
drive me far away from here.

318
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:30,500
There's like two whole economies in
there... there's cash and there's trade.

319
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:32,699
So I gotta keep three games
going at once, all right?

320
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:36,301
A game with the white guys,
a game with the brothers,
and a game with the guards.

321
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:39,438
And the trick is, I gotta take
enough cash off the white guys...

322
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:43,246
to lose it to the guards so that
they keep doing me favors and shit,

323
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:47,345
but I gotta trim enough smokes
off the black guys that I can
trade and keep myself...

324
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:51,984
in the style that I've grown
accustomed to, and all of this
without getting my ass kicked.

325
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,051
So you're working
with a partner?

326
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:56,120
No. Who the hell
am I gonna trust in there?

327
00:22:56,198 --> 00:22:58,291
- It's just me all alone.
- What's this? Come here.

328
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:00,892
- You like that? Isn't that beautiful?
- What is that?

329
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:03,802
It's like an ace up my sleeve.
What else?

330
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:06,705
Wait till I show you some of my chops,
man. I've gotten pretty blinding.

331
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:09,505
- It's like, it's like, you know...
- All right.

332
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:11,512
It's gonna blow your mind,
blow your mind.

333
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,208
You been working?
Is your game sharp?

334
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:16,251
No, man,
I'm off it.

335
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:18,548
What, are you...
you gettin' cold cards?

336
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,145
No, man,
I mean I quit.

337
00:23:21,223 --> 00:23:25,284
- [Laughs] What, are you shitting me?
- No, man, l...

338
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,262
- I got cleaned out.
- Mike McD? You lost?

339
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:33,427
Yeah, man, l... It was a real
blood game over at KGB's place.

340
00:23:33,502 --> 00:23:36,437
You sat down with the Mad Russian
and he emptied your pockets?

341
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:39,269
Yeah. I didn't want to tell you
while you were in there.

342
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:41,935
I didn't want to
dispirit you like that.

343
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,740
Jesus, what were you thinking?
So, you're just a student now?

344
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:47,941
- What are you doing for money?
- I'm driving Knish's truck.

345
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:51,850
Oh, God, you're killin' me. Mike, Mike,
we gotta get you back on the game.

346
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,184
- The old partners here,
we're gonna run like...
- No, no, no, I'm off it.

347
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,884
I mean, I really am. Done.

348
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:00,360
You are, huh? All right. I know a game
perfect for the two of us.

349
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,728
It's a berry patch right outside
New York City... prime pickings.

350
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,634
- I'll drop you... I'll drop you off.
- Okay.

351
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,605
- I mean it. No, I'm really off it.
- I know, I know.

352
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:22,740
This is it,
this is it.

353
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:25,412
So get this, here's the plan.
I know this girl Barbara.

354
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:30,117
She's fuckin' hot. I was this close
to bangin' her when they sent me away.

355
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:33,628
She works as a hostess for all these
fuckin' trust fund babies in here.

356
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:35,629
She got me into
their little game.

357
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:40,134
She introduced me as her cousin
from out of town who loves to
gamble but wants to learn poker.

358
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:42,136
That sounds solid.
That's a nice hookup.

359
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:46,140
It's all the way nice. There's only
one problem. I got this feeling.

360
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:50,770
- What feeling is that, exactly?
- You know this feeling very well.

361
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:52,871
- You know, when you got
your table all set.
- Uh-huh.

362
00:24:52,948 --> 00:24:56,213
- Knife, fork, sauce,
A-1, Luger's, but...
- Yeah.

363
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:59,776
- You just don't have the stake.
- Exactly. Glad you understand.

364
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:02,517
A nickel would start me
very nicely.

365
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:05,059
Whoa, Jesus, what have you
been livin' on?

366
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:07,823
I'm livin' a little light,
I told you.

367
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:11,832
- Anyway, that's $220,
so that'll get you started.
- $220, I mean...

368
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,961
Hey, thanks, but I mean,
that's, like, 11 bets.

369
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:18,472
I mean, I can't
even get a table on this...

370
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,441
Good, so forget this game. I'll
straighten you out in the city tomorrow.

371
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,172
No way. I gotta get started.
[Chuckles]

372
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:26,237
I mean, I'm already
behind here.

373
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:28,748
You just got out.
What's the big fuckin' hurry?

374
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:31,217
The hurry is, other than you,
my friend, there's about five guys,

375
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:34,813
like, eagerly awaiting
my release.

376
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,381
- How much do you owe?
- Like, ten.

377
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:41,418
- Ten?
- I can't even figure it with the juice.

378
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:45,626
Hey, look, I can get
started on this easy
if it's you and me working together.

379
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:50,497
I heard you asking before, and I hear
you asking now, but I can't do that.

380
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:53,735
I just can't do that.
I've made promises.

381
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:57,006
Hey, you know what? What am I saying?
I totally understand, I do.

382
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,243
It's fine. I'll make a couple of moves
earlier than I would have normally...

383
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:04,513
- But thanks, I appreciate it.
- Premium hands.

384
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:09,489
- I'll catch you in the city tomorrow?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:12,527
Hey, Mike, man.
Fuckin' great to see ya.

386
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:14,687
You too.

387
00:26:57,305 --> 00:27:00,103
[Mike Narrating] In Confessions of
a Winning Poker Player, Jack King said,

388
00:27:00,175 --> 00:27:03,508
"Few players recall big pots
they have won, strange as it seems,

389
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:06,240
"but every player can remember
with remarkable accuracy...

390
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:09,215
the outstanding tough beats
of his career."

391
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:11,275
Seems true to me.
'Cause walking in here,

392
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:13,617
I can hardly remember
how I built my bankroll,

393
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:16,748
but I can't stop thinking
of how I lost it.

394
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,793
Mike.

395
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,489
- Hi.
- Barbara. Worm said
you'd be running a little late.

396
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:24,725
Just follow me.

397
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:34,135
I probably won't even sit.
You know, just kinda keep him company.

398
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:36,336
No, no, that's
not gonna work.

399
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:40,108
Here's the play...
you're my new boyfriend,
you're looking for a regular game.

400
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:43,242
Really? Well, I'm not
much of a card player.

401
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:47,584
Bullshit. Worm tells me that's
precisely what you are.

402
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:53,525
My cut is 25 per cent.

403
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:56,996
- I see.
- Good. Come on.

404
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:05,272
Gentlemen.

405
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,535
- This is my boyfriend Michael.
- [Group] Hello, Michael.

406
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,644
[Barbara]
Be nice to him.

407
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,772
- Leave him enough money
to buy me breakfast.
- [Laughter]

408
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:15,783
- Good luck.
- Thanks, sweetie.

409
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,012
Here, why don't you
pull up a chair.

410
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:23,146
- Okay, this one's Chicago.
- You know Chicago?

411
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:25,284
- Uh, remind me.
- Stud game.

412
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,521
High spade in the hole
wins half the pot.

413
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:30,724
Okay, well,
deal me in, I guess.

414
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:35,669
- That's you.
- Oh, thanks.

415
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:40,003
Okay.

416
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:43,970
- That's two on you, Murph.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

417
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:49,981
- I'm in.
- I'm gonna make it five.

418
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,815
Hey, big spender.

419
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:56,984
[Mike Narrating]
Worm and I fall into our old rhythm
like Clyde Frazier and Pearl Monroe.

420
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:00,926
We bring out all the old school tricks,
stuff that would
never play in the city...

421
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:03,089
signalling, chip placing,
trapping.

422
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:05,632
- We even run the old best hand play.
- Raise.

423
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,396
I can probably crack the game
just as quickly straight up,

424
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,768
but there's no risk
in this room.

425
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,866
Now, some people might look down on
Worm's mechanics, call it immoral.

426
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:19,277
But as Canada Bill Jones said, "It's
immoral to let a sucker keep his money."

427
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:22,373
Like they teach you
in One-L...

428
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,010
caveat emptor, pal.

429
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:29,045
- I got the boat, queens over.
- [Chuckles]

430
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:33,288
[Chuckles]
He asked you if that stung, Birch.

431
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:35,727
[Mike Narrating]
Worm really has become an artist, too.

432
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:39,028
Discard culls, pickup culls,
overhand run ups, the Double Duke...

433
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,093
His technique is flawless.
But his judgment is a little off.

434
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:45,639
A few times, I have to fold the case
on him, just so it won't be obvious.

435
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:52,070
Still, he plays the part
of the loser to perfection.

436
00:29:52,147 --> 00:29:54,274
Flush.

437
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:56,909
I got the full house.
I got the queens over the aces.

438
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:59,613
Ahh, fuck!
You know what?

439
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:03,715
- Fuck you and your never-ending
string of boats, okay?
- Hey.

440
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:10,031
Well, my Uncle Les says when the
money's gone, it's time to move on,

441
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:13,898
so enjoy it,
you secret handshaking assholes.

442
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:20,340
Murph! Hey, come back any time.
Your money's always good here.

443
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:24,367
- [Door Closes]
- Good night, Mike. See you next time.

444
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,971
You guys, uh,
wanna keep playing?

445
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:44,165
How'd we do?
Oh, beautiful.

446
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:46,393
Fuckin' assholes,
they deserved it.

447
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:48,459
All right, $300,
that's your cut.

448
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:51,027
- Thank you very much, boys.
- Hey, you were great. Great.

449
00:30:51,106 --> 00:30:54,234
- When can we do this again?
- No, no, it was a one-time thing for me.

450
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:56,504
- Just because.
- Forget it.

451
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:59,638
- Uh, two weeks.
- Two weeks? Okay. Okay.

452
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:03,707
- Hey, thanks a lot. Yeah.
- [Chuckles]

453
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:05,878
Hey, I had to try, right?

454
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:07,945
Bye.

455
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:10,014
Hey, how'd you know
I was coming back?

456
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:12,992
That's easy.
Who's your favorite actor?

457
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:16,895
Clint Eastwood. The Outlaw Josey Wales,
man. The Man with No Name.

458
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:19,024
He always doubles back
for a friend.

459
00:31:20,435 --> 00:31:22,869
[Worm] Hey, we made good time.
Wanna get breakfast?

460
00:31:22,937 --> 00:31:26,464
[Mike] No, I gotta get home. If she
hasn't already changed the locks on me.

461
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,839
Just do me a favor.
Give me five minutes.

462
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,071
Get me
straightened out.

463
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:38,649
This may not look like Teddy's place,
but it ain't the Ivy Leagues either.

464
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,245
So don't fuck around.
You gotta play on your belly.

465
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:43,415
All right.
No problem.

466
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,196
Hey, you know I have no problem
with the way you help yourself,

467
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:53,826
but these guys
are fast company.

468
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:56,097
- They'll spot every move.
- Tough customers, huh?

469
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:58,162
- Yeah. I'm serious.
- All right.

470
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,207
- You won't just get
a finger up your spine.
- Okay, I hear ya.

471
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,436
- I'm playing straight.
- [Buzzes]

472
00:32:12,454 --> 00:32:15,480
Michael McDermott.

473
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:17,684
- How you doin', Mikey?
- Good, how you doin'?

474
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,159
Good. You know, um,

475
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:22,219
the computer tried
to delete you last week.

476
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,231
- Oh, yeah?
- But I knew you'd be back.

477
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,597
Oh, no, I'm not back,
I just...

478
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:29,034
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

479
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:32,039
Um, this is Les Murphy.
He's like my brother.

480
00:32:32,107 --> 00:32:34,075
Call me Worm.

481
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:37,976
- [Phone Rings]
- Hey. Don't wiggle away.

482
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:40,640
Hey, what's she
wearing the button for?

483
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:43,650
They're wired right into the precinct.
They got 'em on the payroll.

484
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:52,452
- What are they playing?
- Uh, 20-40 forced rotation.

485
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:55,257
It's the only game going
right now.

486
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,992
Is that Fat Greggie sitting 20-40?
The game's that soft?

487
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:02,526
Yeah. It's a real live game.
So, you guys gonna play?

488
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,538
- No.
- Hell, yeah, I'm gonna play.

489
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:07,268
- Oh, come on, you're not
gonna walk away from this.
- Not gonna happen.

490
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:10,140
Mike, we could cut
this room up in an hour.

491
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:16,877
All right, run along, then.
Say hi to her for me.

492
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:21,081
- Me, too.
- I will. Take care of him.

493
00:33:25,026 --> 00:33:27,586
Jesus. What a fuckin' waste.

494
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:30,130
Do you believe that?
She's really got him by the balls.

495
00:33:30,198 --> 00:33:32,996
- That's not so bad, is it?
- Depends on the grip.

496
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,558
- Come on, give me $2,000.
- On the finger?

497
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:38,572
You heard Mike.
He's good for it. Come on.

498
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,973
Look, I'm gonna triple that
in half an hour, princess. Let's go.

499
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:44,409
Okay.

500
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,484
[Keys Jingling,
Door Opening]

501
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:04,356
Hey.

502
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:06,730
Reunion run a little late?

503
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:09,599
I was gonna call,
but I didn't want to wake you up.

504
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:12,196
It's okay.
I wasn't sleeping.

505
00:34:12,273 --> 00:34:14,867
Well, why don't you change
and we'll get a cab.

506
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:19,538
Um, why don't you just go ahead,
and I'm gonna jump in the shower.

507
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:23,345
And if I miss a little bit
of the Mulligan meeting,
just cover for me, all right?

508
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,928
Hey.

509
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:38,061
At least give me a story.
You know, I mean...

510
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:40,464
I mean, tell me you were
out drinking till you threw up.

511
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:43,766
Tell me you were getting
lap dances over at Scores.

512
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,672
- I don't care, just give me something.
- I was entertaining Worm.

513
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:50,370
- Uh-huh.
- The least I can do for the guy.

514
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:54,108
- So, you were nowhere near a card game.
- Sweetie.

515
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:56,377
What?
I'm asking you a question.

516
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:59,943
- I'm just...
- No. I was nowhere near a card game.

517
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:02,285
All right?

518
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:04,291
All right.
I'll wait for you.

519
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,524
I mean, the key is a seamless
passing of the baton among the team.

520
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:43,155
I think the most important thing
is to be respectful to
the judges but not obsequious.

521
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:45,199
Now, wait a minute.
Make sure to be deferential.

522
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:47,325
Gene Marinacci won't buy
deferential.

523
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,461
Oh, it's Gene, is it?

524
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:52,438
Well, I knew there was a reason
why you were lead counsel,

525
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:55,442
and it's got nothing to do
with your punctuality.

526
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,444
Sorry.
I couldn't find a cab.

527
00:35:57,512 --> 00:36:01,414
Anyway, when you make
the opening remarks, make sure
you stick to the fact pattern.

528
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:05,475
And use the right cites.
Use book cites, not Lexis.

529
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:07,578
Hi, Jo.

530
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:09,589
- Long time.
- Knish. How are you?

531
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:14,251
The same.

532
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:17,628
I don't mean to interrupt
you future magistrates and noblemen,

533
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,667
but l, uh,
I need a word.

534
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:23,503
- Um...
- It's important.

535
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:26,039
Okay. Excuse me.

536
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:28,166
Sorry.

537
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,875
- I'll act as lead counsel.
- It's all right, Kelly.

538
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:35,040
We were gonna
take a break anyway.

539
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,607
Coffee time.

540
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:44,320
The guy's a cheat.
He always has been.

541
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:47,054
Right now, he's over at Chesterfield's,
ruining your reputation...

542
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,062
with every lousy second
he deals.

543
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,655
Shit. I told him.
Did anybody else see him?

544
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:54,930
Nobody saw... I heard it.
Snapping sound gave it away.

545
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:57,436
I didn't know him,
I might not have noticed.

546
00:36:57,505 --> 00:37:00,269
I turn around, and I see him
with the mechanic's grip, I know.

547
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:02,536
- You want one?
- Did you give him the office?

548
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,545
I tried to warn him, but
he looked right through me.

549
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:07,672
- All right, I'll go get him.
- No, no, no. He's okay now.

550
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:10,479
Most of those Georges are at the tail
end of a 36-hour session.

551
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:14,112
They can't see straight.
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

552
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:16,486
But if he's still there
when Roman and Maurice start their game,

553
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:18,491
he's gonna wish he was
still inside.

554
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,493
I'm gonna go get him.

555
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:26,331
[Mike Narrating]
Amarillo Slim, the greatest
proposition gambler of all time,

556
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:28,460
held to his father's maxim...

557
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,835
"You can shear a sheep many times,
but skin him only once."

558
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:34,170
Gotta bet my jacks.

559
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:37,143
This is a lesson
Worm's never bothered to learn.

560
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:39,771
- [Speaking Russian]
- Hey, guys.

561
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:41,781
English only at the table,
no Russian.

562
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:44,943
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

563
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:47,613
If you want to see
this seventh card, you're gonna
stop speaking fuckin' Sputnik.

564
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:50,384
- Oh, da, motherfucker.
- You're worried we might work together.

565
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,449
I'm sure you're just talking
about perogies...

566
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:54,552
and snow and shit, but let's
cut it out, all right?

567
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:56,824
There's the river,
down and dirty.

568
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,563
I think you got that ace,
Roman, but I'm gonna pay for it.

569
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:05,072
Okay, well,
I got the jacks. Come on.

570
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,300
- Ace.
- Oh, you got it.
- And six.

571
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,468
Wow, two pair.
But I got sevens, too, though.

572
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:13,446
- With my jacks.
- Motherfucker, slow rolling me
like that.

573
00:38:13,514 --> 00:38:15,539
You said just jacks.

574
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,550
But you made me for the sevens,
Maurice. You're a player.

575
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:20,678
- Fuck!
- Hey, come on! Don't be a fuckin' baby.

576
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:22,848
- Hey, Maurice.
- [Together] Hey.

577
00:38:22,924 --> 00:38:25,449
Hey, Mike, you here to play?
Come on, we need some new blood.

578
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:28,427
They're putting a fucking bracelet
on me tomorrow for four months.

579
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:30,987
- I already stuck two racks.
- Well, have a good rest, man.

580
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,999
Can I talk to you
for a second, Cosmonaut?

581
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:36,161
No, man, I'm on a roll.
This is a very emotional game.

582
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:38,205
Gotta do it.

583
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:40,763
- [Speaking In Russian]
- I counted these.

584
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:42,810
Leave it.
It's fine.

585
00:38:42,877 --> 00:38:45,345
[Speaking In Russian]

586
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:50,874
- What's going on?
- Where are you at?

587
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:54,012
I was pumped up eight G's. I was ready
to go on a run when you came along.

588
00:38:54,088 --> 00:38:57,148
- All right, listen.
- Hey, wait, I want a hot dog.

589
00:38:57,225 --> 00:38:59,955
You're in town for five fuckin' minutes,
you already got a sign on your back.

590
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,121
Oh, what, that fuckin' Knish
rat me out?

591
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,188
You gotta stop listening
to that guy, man.

592
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,564
He sees all the angles, but
he doesn't have the balls to play one.

593
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:09,899
Hey, that guy hasn't had to
work in 15 years, Worm.

594
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,303
You don't think that's work,
what he does?

595
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:14,671
Grinding it out on his fuckin'
leather ass? No, thank you.

596
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:17,711
I thought so, too, all right?
Now I know what real work is.

597
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:20,303
Speaking of which,
are you even gonna get a job?

598
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:22,611
Or are you just gonna go back
to printing those credit cards?

599
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:24,947
- Huh? You gonna go away again?
- I wasn't printing.

600
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:27,852
I was distributing. Distributing.
It's different, okay?

601
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:30,083
Second of all, I'm never
going back there.

602
00:39:30,157 --> 00:39:32,557
Stop worrying
so much, okay?

603
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:34,561
Come here.

604
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:39,833
I just want you to think
long term, all right? Be smart.

605
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:42,768
Every place in Manhattan,
they all keep books, all right?

606
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:46,034
If you get listed as a mechanic,
then not only are you gonna
get the shit kicked out of you,

607
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:48,837
you're not gonna get a fuckin' game
anywhere in New York.

608
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,242
It's stupid.
It's just bad business.

609
00:39:51,312 --> 00:39:54,304
Look, this is what I love about you...
you think about the big picture.

610
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:56,316
That's great, okay?
But it's not me.

611
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:58,648
I don't play the game straight up,
and then if I lose,

612
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,653
go get some real work
or something, okay?

613
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,655
I see a mark,
I take him down.

614
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:04,748
That's what I do.
That's the way I live.

615
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:07,350
I know. Listen, you're the guy
who taught me all the angles.

616
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:10,420
- But I'm not the guy
with my nose open right now.
- Aw, come on.

617
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:13,831
I'm not gonna preach to you, but those
two guys in there, they're not rabbits.

618
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:17,166
Roman and Maurice?
They're Russian outfit guys.

619
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:20,105
Not as bad as KGB, but you don't want
to be fuckin' with those guys.

620
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:24,167
With those fake
Versace shirts and shit? Jesus.

621
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:28,204
Look, you still got time.
Just go back in there, right?

622
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:30,216
Lose their fuckin' money
back to 'em, all right?

623
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:32,309
Just make it look good.
Just catch a run of real shitty cards.

624
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,377
- Give it back to 'em.
- I can't. I can't.

625
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:37,219
I gotta put some scratch together, man.
I gotta get somethin' going.

626
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:40,624
Then go out to suburbia, man. Play
in a fuckin' dentist's game, okay?

627
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:44,859
- Go to Swan Meadow,
play in the golf pro game.
- That's an idea.

628
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:48,424
I'll definitely do that,
but I can't dump to these guys.

629
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:51,198
You got to.

630
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:53,206
All right,
whatever, whatever.

631
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:56,038
Meet me at Stromboli's
in half an hour, all right?

632
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,078
I can't, I gotta go.
I have a meeting.

633
00:40:58,145 --> 00:41:00,079
And then I gotta go to fuckin' Queens.
I gotta load the truck.

634
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:02,843
Jesus, man, you're such
a fuckin' workin' man now.
I'm never gonna see you.

635
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:06,478
- Make it look good.
I mean it, make it look good.
- You know me.

636
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:20,760
- So, how'd you do?
- Ah, so-so.

637
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,631
Six thousand,
two thousand.

638
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:28,300
Oh, hold on.
Two more.

639
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:30,310
All right, so it's
ten grand total,

640
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:32,346
take back the two we lent you,
give you the white meat.

641
00:41:32,413 --> 00:41:34,381
You know what?

642
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:36,939
Why don't you give me
all of it?

643
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:39,418
Usually, credit players
only leave with their profit.

644
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,751
Otherwise, the juice starts
five points a week on Mike.

645
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:43,756
Oh, okay.
We'll owe you.

646
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:48,761
[Sighs]

647
00:41:59,006 --> 00:42:03,136
Hey. I've been looking
all over for you.

648
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,144
Didn't want to
be found.

649
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:08,545
You know, Petrovsky waited and waited.
So did the rest of the group.

650
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:11,517
- Jo, look, I missed one meeting.
- It's not about the meeting.

651
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:15,112
I don't care about the meeting. Do
you even know why I left this morning?

652
00:42:15,189 --> 00:42:18,283
- I found that gangster's roll
in your pocket.
- It's not what you think.

653
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:22,489
- It's not what you think.
- Who do you think I am?
You lie right to my face?

654
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:25,657
Look, old days at least
you never lied.

655
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:27,826
You lost everything,
but at least you never lied.

656
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:33,970
Jo, this wasn't even a real game.
This was like Wiffle Ball.

657
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,066
- Can you lose your rent
playing Wiffle Ball?
- No, I couldn't lose.

658
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:38,703
- That's the point.
- No, Mike, you can lose.

659
00:42:38,779 --> 00:42:41,748
I watched you, I stood by you while
you lost everything before.

660
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:44,512
- I don't think I can go
through that with you again.
- Jo, I wasn't gonna lose!

661
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:46,883
Why does this still seem
like gambling to you?

662
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:49,422
Why do you think the same five guys
make it to the final table...

663
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,981
at the World Series of Poker
every single year?

664
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:54,186
What are they, the luckiest guys
in Las Vegas?

665
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:58,322
- It's a skill game, Jo.
- Great. So why'd you
have to lie to me?

666
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:02,597
- Because I knew you wouldn't understand.
- Understand what?

667
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,572
Last night, I sat down
at this card table.

668
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,907
I felt alive for the first time since
I got busted at KGB's joint, okay?

669
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:15,005
You just told me you felt alive for
the first time at a fucking card table.

670
00:43:15,082 --> 00:43:18,882
- No, what...
- What's that supposed to
make me understand?

671
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,427
[Sighs]

672
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:34,232
 [Rock]

673
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:48,774
 Midnight, gettin' uptight
Where are you 

674
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:51,249
- You said you need me
but it's quarter to 2:00 
- I heard you was out.

675
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:53,786
Hey, fuckin' Grama.
How you doin'?

676
00:43:53,854 --> 00:43:56,049
- I was just thinkin' about you.
You know, I could use you.
- Oh, yeah?

677
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:58,614
See me in, like, two weeks.
I'll put you back on the payroll.

678
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:03,129
Well, I got some bad news for ya, Worm.
I'm out on my own now.

679
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:05,688
- Really?
- Yeah.

680
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,859
Go figure.

681
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:11,302
There were a lot of angry people when
you went away. A lot of people were mad.

682
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:13,704
I know, Grama, that's why I'm trying
to put together a roll here.

683
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:15,765
A lot of people coming up to me,
asking if I could help,

684
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:17,811
asking if I knew
where to find you.

685
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:20,506
- So, it got me to thinkin'.
- Really, you thinkin' now? That's big.

686
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:23,744
Hey, Jesus! Come on!
Take it easy.

687
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:26,252
It's just
a friend of mine.

688
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,687
Hey! Easy, easy, easy, easy.
God!

689
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:32,851
Get the fuck outta here.
What did I say?

690
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:36,158
- Hey, man, take it easy!
- Get the fuck outta here!

691
00:44:37,765 --> 00:44:40,563
Okay.
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

692
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:44,161
Instead of you owing 15 grand spread out
to five guys, you owe 25 to me.

693
00:44:44,238 --> 00:44:46,672
What? Where the fuck
do you get off? 25 grand?

694
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,300
Where the fuck
do I get off?

695
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:51,367
[Grunts]
Ohh.

696
00:44:51,445 --> 00:44:55,381
Here's how it is. 25 grand,
and the juice is still runnin'.

697
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:57,917
Jesus Christ.

698
00:44:57,985 --> 00:45:00,112
What the fuck are you doin', man?
You were my partner.

699
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:02,121
No, no,
I was your lackey.

700
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:04,123
But I learned
a few things, Worm.

701
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:07,957
I consolidated
your outstanding debt.

702
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:11,293
[Scoffs] Where'd you get
the scratch for that?

703
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:14,596
You've been rolling fags
in the Village again. [Grunts]

704
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:17,102
- Still a wise ass. Unbelievable.
- [Spits]

705
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:19,731
What I did was go partners
with an old friend of yours.

706
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:23,140
Teddy KGB backed me.

707
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,701
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

708
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,375
[Spits]
Teddy's got plenty of goons.

709
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:32,510
Why would he put you
under his flag?

710
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:37,319
Because as soon as he heard your name,
he became real excited for the prospect.

711
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:40,019
What, so you bought me up, Grama?
[Scoffs]

712
00:45:40,094 --> 00:45:43,359
Yeah, got a real sweet deal, too.
30 cents on the dollar.

713
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,558
There's not a lot of faith in you
out there in the business community.

714
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:49,501
Great, so you're a banker now, Grama.
That's really classy.

715
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,438
Not exactly. I don't have to tell you
my collection methods.

716
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:55,441
[Sighs]
Oh, God. All right, look.

717
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:57,477
Just take it easy,
all right?

718
00:45:57,544 --> 00:45:59,603
I'll scrape something together,
and I'll find you this week.

719
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,978
- That's just what I figured.
- No, no, no.

720
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:05,917
- So I'm gonna take what you
got on you right now.
- Here. Fine.

721
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:09,547
Have yourself
a ball, okay?

722
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:11,557
[Sighs, Chuckles]

723
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:14,150
[Groans]
God!

724
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:16,958
Damn!
[Groans]

725
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:31,143
Excuse me.

726
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:44,657
Mind if I sit?

727
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:47,159
Michael.

728
00:46:47,227 --> 00:46:50,128
Please, please.
Sit, sit.

729
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,767
That was a nifty trick
the other night.

730
00:46:56,837 --> 00:46:58,930
- It was wonderful.
- [Chuckles] Thank you.

731
00:46:59,006 --> 00:47:02,737
Marinacci and the D.A. were ready to cut
cards for your services at that point.

732
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,244
[Chuckles]

733
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:09,112
Of course,
it was an altogether different trick,
that disappearing act...

734
00:47:09,183 --> 00:47:11,174
you pulled today
at your group's meeting.

735
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:15,950
- Yeah. Well, I figure
I owe you an explanation.
- Ah, not to me.

736
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:18,116
I'm sure there's
a good reason you left.

737
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:20,490
You'll just have to
work harder. Prepare.

738
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:23,997
- [Chuckles]
- And smooth things out with the others.

739
00:47:24,064 --> 00:47:27,329
Right. Yeah.
Okay.

740
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:31,064
- Okay, well, thanks.
- Stay. Take a drink.

741
00:47:32,506 --> 00:47:34,440
- Jamie?
- Yeah?

742
00:47:34,508 --> 00:47:37,136
- Another glass, darling.
- Sure.

743
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:39,338
- What are you drinking?
- Gin. Always gin.

744
00:47:39,413 --> 00:47:41,347
- Here you go.
- Thanks, dear.

745
00:47:41,415 --> 00:47:43,781
Thank you.

746
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:47,184
I know a magician doesn't
divulge his secrets, but...

747
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:49,916
[Chuckles]
I'm no magician.

748
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,391
Well, if it wasn't magic,

749
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,054
how did you know
what everyone held?

750
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,065
It's a combination
of things.

751
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:01,192
Um, I was watching
when the cards came out.

752
00:48:01,268 --> 00:48:05,728
That's... That's just an old habit
with me, like breathing.

753
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:07,831
You watch the cards.

754
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:11,344
I watch the cards also, but I watch
the players reacting to the cards.

755
00:48:11,412 --> 00:48:13,972
That's how I knew the D.A.
made his two pair,

756
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:16,482
and Judge Kaplan
missed the flush.

757
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,916
I was watching their eyes
when they checked their river cards.

758
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:22,251
- Their faces tell you everything.
- You watch the man.

759
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:26,486
l... I never knew you had
to calculate so much at cards.

760
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:35,932
All right, here's the thing.
You only play premium hands.

761
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:38,801
You only start
with jacks or better split,

762
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:41,397
nines or better wired,
three high cards to a flush.

763
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:44,308
If it's good enough to call, you gotta
be in there raising, all right?

764
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:48,280
I mean, tight, but aggressive.
And I do mean aggressive.
That's your style, Professor.

765
00:48:48,348 --> 00:48:51,112
I mean, you gotta...
you gotta think of it as a war.

766
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:55,212
You are officially never
invited to our game again. [Chuckles]

767
00:48:57,391 --> 00:49:01,191
I don't blame you. Put a guy
like me in a game like that,
the cards don't even matter.

768
00:49:01,261 --> 00:49:03,195
I'll play it blind.

769
00:49:05,132 --> 00:49:08,465
Michael,

770
00:49:08,535 --> 00:49:11,629
- May I tell you a story?
- Please.

771
00:49:11,705 --> 00:49:17,007
For generations,
men of my family have been rabbis.

772
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:20,137
In Israel,
before that in Europe.

773
00:49:20,214 --> 00:49:23,911
It was to be my calling.
I was quite a prodigy.

774
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:26,384
The pride of my yeshiva.

775
00:49:26,453 --> 00:49:28,683
The elders said I had
a 40-year-old's understanding...

776
00:49:28,755 --> 00:49:32,418
of the midrash
by the time I was 12.

777
00:49:32,493 --> 00:49:34,757
But by the time
I was 13,

778
00:49:36,263 --> 00:49:38,595
I knew I could never
be a rabbi.

779
00:49:38,665 --> 00:49:40,599
Why not?

780
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:44,000
Because for all
I understood of the Talmud,

781
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:48,669
I never saw
God there.

782
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:51,506
- You couldn't lie to yourself.
- I tried.

783
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:53,512
Tried like crazy.

784
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,811
I mean, people were
counting on me.

785
00:49:56,884 --> 00:49:59,978
But yours is
a respectable profession.

786
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:01,987
Not to my family.

787
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:06,424
My parents were destroyed,
devastated by my decision.

788
00:50:08,262 --> 00:50:13,564
My father sent me away
to New York...

789
00:50:13,634 --> 00:50:16,398
to live
with distant cousins.

790
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,268
Eventually, l...
I found my place,

791
00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:22,103
my life's work.

792
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:25,944
What then?

793
00:50:26,013 --> 00:50:28,948
I immersed myself fully,
I studied the minutiae,

794
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:31,450
I learned everything I could
about the law.

795
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:34,510
I mean, I felt deeply inside
that it was what I was born to do.

796
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:41,125
- And did your parents get over it?
- No.

797
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:45,325
I always hoped
that I would find...

798
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:48,334
some way to change
their minds, but...

799
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:53,973
They were
inconsolable.

800
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:59,002
My father never spoke
to me again.

801
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:06,349
If you had to do it
all over again,

802
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,220
would you make
the same choices?

803
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,554
What choice?

804
00:51:16,063 --> 00:51:19,260
The last thing I took away
from the yeshiva is this...

805
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:23,935
We can't run
from who we are.

806
00:51:26,173 --> 00:51:28,437
Our destiny chooses us.

807
00:51:31,778 --> 00:51:34,406
Hey.
L'chayim.

808
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:57,169
Hey.

809
00:51:57,237 --> 00:51:59,205
Hey, where you been?
I've been freezing my ass off.

810
00:51:59,273 --> 00:52:02,868
- What happened?
- Ah, ran into a door.
Don't worry about it.

811
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,037
- What happened?
- Hey! She crossed her legs
too fast, all right?

812
00:52:06,113 --> 00:52:08,240
- Just mind your own business.
- You comin' up?

813
00:52:08,315 --> 00:52:10,613
No, I've been standing out here
all this time just to say hi.

814
00:52:10,684 --> 00:52:13,312
Listen, things haven't
been that smooth on the home front,

815
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:15,981
so tone it down
a little, all right?

816
00:52:16,056 --> 00:52:18,684
- Tone down what, motherfucker?
- Great.

817
00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:21,250
- Never mind.
- [Laughs]

818
00:52:23,697 --> 00:52:26,632
When you become a big shot lawyer,
could you find us an elevator building?

819
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,634
Shut up.

820
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:35,405
What, did you
get robbed?

821
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:38,171
Um, not exactly.

822
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:43,079
Wait, wait, wait.
Did she split on you?

823
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,210
[Scoffs]
Oh, God.

824
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:51,948
Oh, my God. Mike, she made off
with your sheets.

825
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:54,516
I always told her she'd be
a good card player.

826
00:52:54,594 --> 00:52:57,927
- Know exactly when
to release a shitty hand.
- Come on, Mike, forget that.

827
00:52:57,998 --> 00:53:00,796
This girl is obviously
wrapped way too tight for living.

828
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:04,928
No, she was a good... I knew it.
I fuckin' knew it.

829
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:12,011
[Sighs]
It's depressing.

830
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,172
You can't trust 'em.
You can't trust 'em at all.

831
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:18,013
I mean, look at you.
You domesticated yourself for this girl.

832
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:20,883
You took yourself out of the life.
You walked the fuckin' line for her.

833
00:53:20,954 --> 00:53:24,321
And the minute you want a little
of it back, she walks out on you.

834
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:27,326
It's just like
the saying says, you know?

835
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:32,331
In the poker game of life,
women are the rake.

836
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:35,698
- They are the fuckin' rake.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

837
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:39,227
What saying?

838
00:53:39,306 --> 00:53:43,800
I don't know.
But there oughta be one.

839
00:53:46,747 --> 00:53:51,548
- You know what cheers me up
when I'm feelin' shitty?
- What?

840
00:53:51,618 --> 00:53:54,212
Rolled up aces over kings.

841
00:53:57,624 --> 00:53:59,558
- That right?
- Yeah.

842
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:03,960
Check raising stupid tourists
and taking huge pots off 'em.

843
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:08,524
- Yeah?
- Stacks and towers of checks
I can't even see over.

844
00:54:08,602 --> 00:54:13,096
Playin' all night,
high-limit Hold' Em at the Taj.

845
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:16,768
- Where the sand turns to gold.
- Fuck it, let's go.

846
00:54:18,278 --> 00:54:20,838
- Don't tease me.
- Let's play some fuckin' cards.

847
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:36,729
[Mike Narrating]
The poker room at the Mirage in Vegas...

848
00:54:36,797 --> 00:54:39,595
is the center of
the poker universe.

849
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,964
Doyle Brunson, Johnny Chan,
Phil Helmuth...

850
00:54:42,035 --> 00:54:44,299
The legends consider it
their office.

851
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:46,305
Every couple of days
a new millionaire shows up...

852
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:48,534
wanting to beat
a world champion.

853
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:51,771
Usually they go home
with nothing but a story.

854
00:54:51,845 --> 00:54:53,904
Down here, the millionaires are scarce
or they're playing craps,

855
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,471
but there's still
plenty of money for the taking.

856
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,484
In fact, on the weekends
you can't get a game in the city,

857
00:54:58,552 --> 00:55:01,749
because all the New York rounders
are taking care of the tourists here.

858
00:55:01,822 --> 00:55:05,383
Hey, hey, why don't you warm up
a seat for me. I'll catch up with you.

859
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:07,825
- What?
- Look.

860
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:10,727
- I got certain needs
I gotta attend to, okay?
- Hey, good.

861
00:55:10,797 --> 00:55:13,129
- I mean, I'm overdue.
- Good, man, hey, I was startin'
to wonder about you.

862
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,034
I thought, maybe, you know,
the boys upstate brought about
a few changes in you.

863
00:55:17,103 --> 00:55:20,937
Hey, in your dreams,
lover.

864
00:55:28,515 --> 00:55:30,506
- Hey, Mikey!
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

865
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:34,145
This is beautiful.
Welcome to the Chesterfield south.

866
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:36,485
- Ho!
- Changing $500.

867
00:55:36,556 --> 00:55:39,389
Come all the way to Atlantic City
just to see your mugs, huh?

868
00:55:39,459 --> 00:55:41,518
Twice in one week.

869
00:55:41,595 --> 00:55:44,587
For someone who don't play, you spend
a lot of time in card rooms.

870
00:55:44,664 --> 00:55:46,598
This is what
I like to see, huh?

871
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:49,760
Mike McDermott where he belongs...
sittin' with the scumbags.

872
00:55:49,836 --> 00:55:52,464
Tellin' jokes,
draggin' the occasional pot.

873
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:56,498
Occasional? Yeah, like my ex-wife
occasionally went out with other men.

874
00:55:56,576 --> 00:56:01,036
Forget her, Face. I was actually gonna
try and make some real money tonight.

875
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:04,743
But in honor of Mike's
alley-like return to the ring,

876
00:56:04,818 --> 00:56:06,786
I'll sit with you all
for a while.

877
00:56:06,853 --> 00:56:08,912
Hey, don't do us
any favors, Knish.

878
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:12,288
- They're about to go to
the board to fill these seats.
- Bet it.

879
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:15,886
I raise. You know, if we wanted
to take each other's rolls,

880
00:56:15,962 --> 00:56:17,896
we could have just
stayed home.

881
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:21,500
[Mike Narrating]
These two have no idea...

882
00:56:21,568 --> 00:56:25,004
what they're about to
walk into.

883
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:27,039
Down here to have a good time,
they figure...

884
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:30,474
why not give poker a try?

885
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:32,637
After all, how different
can it be from the home games...

886
00:56:32,712 --> 00:56:34,680
they've played
their whole lives?

887
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:41,243
All the luck in the world isn't
gonna change things for these guys.

888
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:44,586
They're simply overmatched.

889
00:56:46,826 --> 00:56:50,694
We're not playing together,
but then again, we're not playing
against each other either.

890
00:56:50,764 --> 00:56:54,996
It's like the Nature Channel. You don't
see piranhas eating each other, do you?

891
00:57:02,842 --> 00:57:06,039
They wear their tells
like signs around their necks.

892
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:09,104
Facial tics, nervous fingers.

893
00:57:09,182 --> 00:57:11,116
A hand over a mouth.

894
00:57:11,184 --> 00:57:14,085
The way a cigarette
is smoked.

895
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:17,282
Little unconscious gestures
that reveal the cards in their hands.

896
00:57:17,357 --> 00:57:19,757
We catch everything.

897
00:57:19,826 --> 00:57:22,420
If a fish acts strong,
he's bluffing.

898
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:25,931
If he acts meek,
he's got a hand. It's that simple.

899
00:57:31,938 --> 00:57:34,429
- How are you, you workaholics?
- Worm.

900
00:57:34,507 --> 00:57:37,067
Good to see ya.
Glad you're out.

901
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:39,236
Number's changed,
of course.

902
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:41,439
Lotta games this weekend,
so you're gonna need the number.

903
00:57:41,514 --> 00:57:43,448
- I'll give you a ring.
- Hey, Worm?

904
00:57:43,516 --> 00:57:45,780
Do they allow people like you
in places like this?

905
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:49,413
Zagosh, when you get yourself a job,
then you can be my fuckin' P.O.

906
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:51,423
How about that?

907
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:54,119
Now, let's get started,
shall we?

908
00:57:54,194 --> 00:57:56,128
I'm sorry, sir.

909
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:58,892
You can't take chips
from another player at the table.

910
00:57:58,965 --> 00:58:00,956
We all know each other here.

911
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:03,832
We're like friends, so if nobody
complains, do you have a problem?

912
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,837
- It's all right.
- No problem.

913
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:10,433
- Sir, you have to buy 'em from me.
- [Sighs]

914
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:15,447
Fuck this low-limit shit.
Can we go get something to eat?
I got comped at the noodle bar.

915
00:58:15,515 --> 00:58:17,380
I want to talk to you.

916
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,611
Look who's treatin'
to a free meal.

917
00:58:19,686 --> 00:58:22,883
Don't let that M.S.G. fuck
up your head more than it is, Mikey.

918
00:58:22,956 --> 00:58:27,086
You keep grinding out that rent money,
Joe. It's noble work you're doing.

919
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,391
So, hey, uh,
Nick the Greek.

920
00:58:30,463 --> 00:58:32,397
What's with
kitin' my checks?

921
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:36,559
- I'm on empty, that's why.
- You are? You're tapped again?

922
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:38,866
I mean...
How much was the hooker?

923
00:58:38,938 --> 00:58:43,375
- Mike, please. Relaxation therapist.
- [Chuckles]

924
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:45,411
Okay?

925
00:58:45,478 --> 00:58:47,844
- It's not where it went.
- Wait a minute.

926
00:58:47,914 --> 00:58:49,848
It went to
Roman and Maurice?

927
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:52,476
I told you, man, you didn't have to
give it all back to 'em.

928
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:55,112
Take a little money
for your time, you know?

929
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:57,156
Hey, that's not
where it went either.

930
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:01,754
- I ran into Grama tonight.
- Yeah?

931
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:03,796
Yeah. He took
everything I had.

932
00:59:03,863 --> 00:59:06,229
You're kiddin' me.
Wait, who's he working for?

933
00:59:08,234 --> 00:59:10,566
Well, he's sorta
out on his own.

934
00:59:10,637 --> 00:59:13,333
This fucker went around
and bought up all my debt. Grama.

935
00:59:13,406 --> 00:59:16,967
That turncoat motherfucker.
Are you kiddin' me?

936
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:19,477
So what do you owe him?

937
00:59:19,546 --> 00:59:21,810
I don't know. By his crazy fuckin'
gorilla math?

938
00:59:21,881 --> 00:59:23,815
Like, 15.

939
00:59:23,883 --> 00:59:26,875
- Fifteen? Fifteen?
- Yeah, I mean...

940
00:59:26,953 --> 00:59:29,979
He says the juice has been running
the entire time on my ten.

941
00:59:30,056 --> 00:59:32,024
- So, it's just like...
- Why didn't you tell me that, man?

942
00:59:32,092 --> 00:59:34,617
Why did you not tell me that?
I could have paid that off.

943
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,958
- I had the... I had the money.
- Hey!

944
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,863
I'm not gonna sit in the can and have
my friend paying down my debt.

945
00:59:39,933 --> 00:59:41,867
I'm not a leech,
all right?

946
00:59:41,935 --> 00:59:44,870
We can help each other, like always.
That's why we're here.

947
00:59:44,938 --> 00:59:47,304
That's... That's why we gotta
get in the bigger game.

948
00:59:47,373 --> 00:59:49,307
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- All right. All right.

949
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,775
- Listen, man, I'll help you.
You know I'll help you, man.
- Yeah?

950
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:54,177
- I mean, fuck that guy.
We'll figure something out.
- Yeah.

951
00:59:59,986 --> 01:00:01,920
How long
should we wait?

952
01:00:01,988 --> 01:00:05,549
I suggest we wait another five minutes,
and then choose another lead counsel.

953
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:12,097
Here he comes.

954
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:18,001
Mr. McDermott,
perhaps we can begin now.

955
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:21,006
I'm so sorry I'm late.

956
01:00:21,074 --> 01:00:25,738
Come to order in the matter
of Slater v. New York State
Higher Education Services.

957
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:29,908
The facts have been stipulated,
the briefs have been read.

958
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:33,419
Lead counsel for plaintiff,
Mr. McDermott,

959
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:38,085
please proceed
with oral arguments now.

960
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:40,456
If that is convenient
for you.

961
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,990
Yes, it is, and again,
I'm sorry, ah, that I'm late.

962
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:49,796
Um...

963
01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:53,305
Well, I think clearly
the, uh...

964
01:00:53,373 --> 01:00:58,276
the case which controls the issue at bar
would be, uh, Texas v. Johnson,

965
01:00:58,344 --> 01:01:01,836
- Which holds...
- [McKinnon] Texas v. Johnson?

966
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:05,817
Mr. McDermott, that is a Supreme Court
free speech case...

967
01:01:05,885 --> 01:01:08,683
that has no bearing
in the premises.

968
01:01:08,755 --> 01:01:12,282
Each group was apprised to ignore
that aspect of this matter...

969
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,385
and focus instead on the idea
of de facto segregation.

970
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:20,392
Right. Um, well...

971
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:22,400
Mr. McDermott has
been unreachable,

972
01:01:22,468 --> 01:01:24,698
so I'll take over,
if it pleases the court.

973
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:28,969
Someone saying something meaningful
would please us a great deal.

974
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:33,239
What we have here is a clear case
of gerrymandering,

975
01:01:33,313 --> 01:01:36,248
impacting schoolchildren
and schools in the district...

976
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:39,308
that was created solely
to separate students by race.

977
01:01:39,385 --> 01:01:43,014
Although not dispositive, the student
body is more than 99 percent white.

978
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:45,580
Well, that
was impressive.

979
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:49,754
Usually you have to know something about
a case to give an opening statement.

980
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:52,161
Guys, what...
what can I say?

981
01:01:52,232 --> 01:01:56,692
Hey, it worked out great
for me, McDermott. I think
I actually impressed Marinacci.

982
01:01:56,769 --> 01:01:58,703
Jo.

983
01:01:59,706 --> 01:02:02,106
- Jo. Jo.
- What?

984
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:06,305
We're not gonna talk?
You left me pretty quick there.

985
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:09,576
- You make it sound
as if it was my decision.
- Well, it wasn't mine.

986
01:02:09,649 --> 01:02:14,018
I came home and you were gone.
You were just gonna drop me like that?

987
01:02:14,087 --> 01:02:16,078
I learned it
from you, Mike.

988
01:02:16,155 --> 01:02:19,420
You always told me
that this was the rule.

989
01:02:19,492 --> 01:02:22,427
Rule number one: Throw in your cards
the moment you know they can't win.

990
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:25,794
- Fold the hand.
- Look, this is our thing
that we're talking about.

991
01:02:25,865 --> 01:02:28,698
It's not some
losing hand of poker.

992
01:02:28,768 --> 01:02:32,932
I know exactly what
we're talking about, Mike.

993
01:02:36,576 --> 01:02:38,942
So, that's the last
of it, then?

994
01:02:41,614 --> 01:02:43,548
Yeah.

995
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:47,484
[Scoffs]

996
01:02:52,892 --> 01:02:57,955
I mean, I'd say good luck, but I know
it's not about luck in your game.

997
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:08,564
[Announcer]
Eric Seidel cannot win this hand,

998
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:10,939
and yet
he doesn't know it.

999
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:16,107
Chan is trying to sucker him in
by taking his time.

1000
01:03:16,182 --> 01:03:19,777
Oh, look at that look
of the defending champ.

1001
01:03:19,852 --> 01:03:23,413
And now Fifth Street,
a six of diamonds. No help.

1002
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:27,118
Johnny Chan has
a queen high straight.

1003
01:03:27,193 --> 01:03:30,959
Will Eric Seidel
fall for the bait?

1004
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,591
Yes, he's going all in,
and Chan has him.

1005
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,931
Johnny Chan, the master...

1006
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:43,341
- Yes, he's going all in,
and Chan has him.
- [Telephone Rings]

1007
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:50,041
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Mike. It's Petra.
Can I come up?

1008
01:03:50,116 --> 01:03:52,050
Yeah, I'll buzz you in.

1009
01:03:52,118 --> 01:03:54,484
[Buzzing]

1010
01:03:56,456 --> 01:03:59,755
Well, that's the important thing
with the game of Hold 'Em.

1011
01:03:59,826 --> 01:04:02,158
You're never down and out
until your chips are all gone.

1012
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,164
- Hey.
- Hey.

1013
01:04:06,232 --> 01:04:08,359
- How you doing?
- Good.

1014
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:15,974
- [TV: Man Continues Speaking]
- I haven't seen the place in a while.

1015
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:17,976
Looks about the same.

1016
01:04:18,044 --> 01:04:22,378
- You want some scotch or something?
- No, I'm fine.

1017
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:27,044
- Oh, '88 World Series, huh?
- Yeah.

1018
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,054
Johnny Chan.

1019
01:04:29,122 --> 01:04:32,751
Flops the nut straight and
has the discipline to wait him out.

1020
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:35,487
He knows Seidel's
gonna bluff at it.

1021
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:38,496
- [Announcer]
And yet he doesn't know it.
- Johnny fucking Chan.

1022
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:42,500
Chan is trying to sucker him in
by taking his time.

1023
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:45,435
Look at the control.
Look at that fuck.

1024
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:48,702
He knows his man well enough
to check it all the way...

1025
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:51,266
and risk winning nothing
with those cards.

1026
01:04:51,344 --> 01:04:53,278
He owns him.

1027
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:56,213
[Announcer]
Will Eric Seidel fall for the bait?

1028
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:59,740
Yes, he's going all in
and Chan has him.

1029
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:04,017
- Johnny Chan, the master.
- Poor Seidel.
Kid doesn't know what hit him.

1030
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,752
Yeah, I know
what that feels like.

1031
01:05:06,826 --> 01:05:10,091
It's like a locomotive
running through your stomach.

1032
01:05:10,163 --> 01:05:14,600
You feel gut-shot. Fuck it.
You didn't come here to talk about this.

1033
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:16,726
What's going on?

1034
01:05:18,805 --> 01:05:22,741
- Tomorrow's a week.
- A week of what?

1035
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,177
The first two thousand
you owe the Chesterfield.

1036
01:05:27,246 --> 01:05:31,046
- Oh. Worm.
- Yes, it's kinda weird.

1037
01:05:31,117 --> 01:05:34,814
He'd just won eight grand.
Why go on the line behind another two?

1038
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:38,584
So, he took, what, about eight
off of Roman and Maurice?

1039
01:05:38,658 --> 01:05:42,321
Yeah, yeah, he comes in
after you leave,

1040
01:05:42,395 --> 01:05:44,693
sits for like
another 20 more minutes,

1041
01:05:44,764 --> 01:05:47,597
cashes out
for the full amount.

1042
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:51,728
Maurice hasn't been back since. I think
he's been playing across the street.

1043
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:55,433
But, uh, Worm's
been around plenty.

1044
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:58,409
He's run you up
just under seven grand.

1045
01:06:00,847 --> 01:06:04,408
Well, do me a favor
and just put him on his own.

1046
01:06:04,484 --> 01:06:07,385
- Yeah?
- Yeah, cut him off.

1047
01:06:07,453 --> 01:06:09,580
Um, I tell ya,
I got a thousand.

1048
01:06:09,655 --> 01:06:12,317
I got a thou.
And that's, you know...

1049
01:06:12,391 --> 01:06:14,689
I just started
coming back, so...

1050
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,993
- Thanks for making it easy, Mike.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1051
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:24,767
I'm, uh... I'm sorry to be back
over here for this reason.

1052
01:06:24,837 --> 01:06:28,739
- Don't worry about it.
- No, l... I like being here.

1053
01:06:28,808 --> 01:06:31,641
It's good
to see you, Mike.

1054
01:06:35,114 --> 01:06:38,208
- I can stay.
- Listen, I tell ya, I'Il... I'Il, um...

1055
01:06:38,284 --> 01:06:41,185
I'll come... I'll come...
I'll see you down at the club.

1056
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:43,950
- I'll come by this week.
- Yeah.

1057
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:03,370
[Glass Shatters]

1058
01:07:24,797 --> 01:07:27,357
I know you're in here.

1059
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,973
Mike?

1060
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:37,976
Hey. I thought you
were the janitor, man.

1061
01:07:38,044 --> 01:07:41,036
It's a good thing Grama
doesn't know you as well as I do.

1062
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:44,105
Come on. I'll play ya horse.
Fifty bucks a letter.

1063
01:07:44,183 --> 01:07:48,381
Yeah? When I win, are you gonna pay
me back with my own fucking money?

1064
01:07:48,454 --> 01:07:52,185
Oh, oh, easy. Relax. Don't wing it.
Just... Just step and throw.

1065
01:07:57,563 --> 01:07:59,758
You need to work
on your accuracy.

1066
01:07:59,832 --> 01:08:03,734
Will you stop fucking around
for five goddamn minutes
for once in your fucking life!

1067
01:08:03,803 --> 01:08:06,738
Whoa, Jesus. What happened?
My old man just walked in the door.

1068
01:08:06,806 --> 01:08:09,934
I should fucking beat the shit
out of you the way he used to.

1069
01:08:12,612 --> 01:08:15,206
You remember when we found
this place, man?

1070
01:08:17,283 --> 01:08:19,774
Yeah, I remember
when we found this place.

1071
01:08:19,852 --> 01:08:23,652
You were hiding from Tommy Manzy
'cause you thought he was gonna
fucking pound you into oblivion.

1072
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:26,658
Yeah, now, see?
What did I ever do to that guy?

1073
01:08:26,726 --> 01:08:29,957
- You fucked his mother.
- [Laughing]

1074
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:33,760
Yeah, but she was a good-Iooking
older woman. You gotta give me that.

1075
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:37,792
You spent a year of your life hiding in
this fucking gym from that sick fuck...

1076
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:41,169
until he pissed off
the wrong guy and someone dropped
a garbage can on his head.

1077
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,107
What do you want me to say? Those
were wild times. You were there too.

1078
01:08:44,176 --> 01:08:46,303
Nothing's changed.
Nothing has changed.

1079
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:49,109
You were hiding from your troubles then.
You're hiding from your troubles now.

1080
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:51,741
I like to hide, and that's
part of the fun for me, you know?

1081
01:08:51,817 --> 01:08:53,751
I don't like
running solo.

1082
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:56,083
It's like I used to have a running
partner, you know what I'm saying?

1083
01:08:56,155 --> 01:08:58,589
If we fucked up back then
and got caught,

1084
01:08:58,658 --> 01:09:02,719
the worst thing that was going to happen
was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.

1085
01:09:02,795 --> 01:09:06,993
But, man, you're fixing to go down hard,
and it almost seems like you want to.

1086
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:09,899
Stop worrying so much about me, okay?
I'm turning things around.

1087
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:12,529
I'm not gonna let anybody
drop a garbage can on my head.

1088
01:09:12,605 --> 01:09:15,802
No, no, you're gonna get out of the way.
It's gonna land on me.

1089
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:17,809
I'll see ya.

1090
01:09:21,213 --> 01:09:25,547
Come on, Mike. Hey.
Come on, come on, come on.

1091
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:29,587
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about the money.

1092
01:09:29,655 --> 01:09:31,589
I should've told you.

1093
01:09:31,657 --> 01:09:35,855
It's just... What do you want me to say?
It's fucking embarrassing.

1094
01:09:35,928 --> 01:09:38,419
l, like, just get out,
I'm in a big fucking hole.

1095
01:09:38,497 --> 01:09:41,489
I need something to get goin'.
I gotta get started.

1096
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:43,501
And?

1097
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:46,800
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
There's been some reversals.

1098
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:51,309
- Some reversals.
How much money do you have?
- Nine hundred.

1099
01:09:51,377 --> 01:09:55,541
I mean, I caught a frozen wave of cards
like you fucking read about.

1100
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:59,345
I think I'm getting you outta hock,
I find out I'm seven grand in.

1101
01:09:59,418 --> 01:10:02,353
I know, man. I was really...
I was really up big.

1102
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:04,355
I was cruising along.

1103
01:10:04,423 --> 01:10:07,324
I tried to beat that blackjack game
at the Horseshoe Club in Brooklyn.

1104
01:10:07,393 --> 01:10:11,193
- That place is a mitt joint.
- I know. It was,
like, ouch. I'm so stupid.

1105
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:14,391
I got so good with this,
I thought I could neutralize 'em.

1106
01:10:14,467 --> 01:10:16,594
You're really jamming me up
here, man. Seven grand.

1107
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:21,333
- I know.
- That's it. I can't go any deeper
than that. You're off the tip.

1108
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:23,773
- I understand. That's okay.
- And you gotta talk with Grama.

1109
01:10:23,843 --> 01:10:26,835
- You gotta square things
away with Grama.
- No way, Mike.

1110
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:29,176
I'm not talking
to that fucking Judas.

1111
01:10:29,248 --> 01:10:31,182
You think
there's any other way?

1112
01:10:34,754 --> 01:10:37,882
[Mike Narrating] I know all
the reasons I shouldn't be here,

1113
01:10:37,957 --> 01:10:40,653
but sometimes
reasons don't matter.

1114
01:10:40,726 --> 01:10:43,718
You see, no one's
ever stood up for Worm.

1115
01:10:43,796 --> 01:10:47,095
The guy's been kicked around
his whole life, from his father on down.

1116
01:10:49,168 --> 01:10:52,501
Maybe he's not the same guy
he was when he went away,

1117
01:10:52,571 --> 01:10:55,540
but I can't give up on him
that easy.

1118
01:10:55,608 --> 01:10:57,769
I'm all he's got.

1119
01:10:57,843 --> 01:11:00,073
Oh, what the hell.

1120
01:11:03,048 --> 01:11:05,676
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

1121
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:08,652
You cops?
You look like cops.

1122
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:12,088
- We're not cops.
- You wanna twirl then?

1123
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:15,127
No, no, we're just here
to see Grama.

1124
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,165
Jesus.

1125
01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:26,796
- You sure about this?
I got a bad feeling.
- That's all right. Just...

1126
01:11:26,872 --> 01:11:30,171
Just let me do
the talking, all right?

1127
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,605
[Mike]
Hey, Grama.

1128
01:11:36,682 --> 01:11:39,913
- Long time.
- Mike.

1129
01:11:39,985 --> 01:11:43,250
Hey, Worm. It's good you came.
That's real smart thinking.

1130
01:11:43,322 --> 01:11:47,019
So, did you bring him along
to help carry all my money?

1131
01:11:47,092 --> 01:11:49,026
Uh, there's no money today.

1132
01:11:49,094 --> 01:11:52,029
No money?
There's gotta be some money.

1133
01:11:52,097 --> 01:11:54,258
Come on. Get outta here.

1134
01:11:56,535 --> 01:11:58,662
He's not kidding.
I got nothing.

1135
01:11:58,737 --> 01:12:02,605
You owe 25. I'll take
the rest in five days.

1136
01:12:02,675 --> 01:12:05,769
- Five grand in a week,
and you keep the juice going...
- Shh. Quiet.

1137
01:12:05,845 --> 01:12:09,372
- [Dog Growling]
- You gotta catch 'em in the act.

1138
01:12:09,448 --> 01:12:10,972
[Dog Growling]

1139
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:16,046
- [Whimpering, Thud]
- Get in your hole, you bitch!

1140
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:18,385
- Christ.
- Fucking dog.

1141
01:12:18,457 --> 01:12:22,723
You can't let 'em get away with it
or else they think they run the place.

1142
01:12:22,795 --> 01:12:25,992
- [Sighs] So, where were we?
- Five grand.

1143
01:12:26,065 --> 01:12:30,661
In a week. Grama, we want what
you want. We wanna square this thing.

1144
01:12:30,736 --> 01:12:34,502
But three days... three days
is impossible. All right?

1145
01:12:34,573 --> 01:12:37,872
No one's saying you're not the man. Just
think of this as a business decision.

1146
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:40,935
Look, he just got out.
Let's put him on a plan.

1147
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:43,811
No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't The Money Store.

1148
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:46,511
We're not negotiating here.
I tell you how it works.

1149
01:12:46,585 --> 01:12:47,984
Well, then, I'm asking.

1150
01:12:50,055 --> 01:12:54,185
So, you're looking for a
little grace, Lester, some charity?

1151
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,889
You know what, Grama?
I need your fucking charity
like I need your cock in my ass.

1152
01:12:57,963 --> 01:13:01,160
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's too late for him to shut up.

1153
01:13:01,233 --> 01:13:03,827
- Hey, listen! He's good for it.
- He's good for it, Mike?

1154
01:13:03,903 --> 01:13:06,337
If you think he's good for it,
it's on you too.

1155
01:13:06,405 --> 01:13:08,339
Then it's on me too.

1156
01:13:08,407 --> 01:13:11,843
- Fifteen large, five days,
or I start breaking things.
- I hear ya.

1157
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:14,903
Get the fuck outta here.

1158
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,948
Piece of shit.

1159
01:13:17,016 --> 01:13:19,450
Now, what the hell
are you doing?

1160
01:13:19,518 --> 01:13:21,952
I'm not gonna get down on my knees
for that jerk-off.

1161
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:24,751
All I said is just keep
your mouth shut for five seconds.

1162
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:27,587
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Goddamn it.

1163
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:30,925
That's it.
I'm really sunk now.

1164
01:13:30,996 --> 01:13:35,330
No, 15 grand in five days.
I can do that. I've gone
on rushes like that before.

1165
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:39,599
Ah, under optimum conditions
with a bankroll, maybe.

1166
01:13:39,672 --> 01:13:42,607
- But what have you got on you?
- Got, like, 350.

1167
01:13:42,675 --> 01:13:46,042
Ah, that's 1,200 between us.
We might as well play the fucking Lotto.

1168
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:49,706
No, man, no. Listen. Find the games,
scout 'em out, I sit, I mop 'em up.

1169
01:13:49,782 --> 01:13:52,148
You know, we might have
a shot at this...

1170
01:13:52,217 --> 01:13:54,845
if we sat together
and just did our thing.

1171
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,718
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm gonna do this straight up.

1172
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,655
- Oh, fuck, man.
- I mean it.

1173
01:13:59,725 --> 01:14:02,853
- Well, where do you wanna start?
- There's a 30-60 at the Chesterfield.

1174
01:14:02,928 --> 01:14:06,227
Come on, listen... there's the 4:00 a.m.
in Woodside. There's the Greeks.

1175
01:14:06,298 --> 01:14:08,789
All right, there's
a union game in Jersey.

1176
01:14:08,867 --> 01:14:11,802
- I know a guy
whose cousin can get us in.
- All right.

1177
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:14,270
- There's four.
- There's a cigar shop in Brooklyn.

1178
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,504
- It's like an easy clean.
- There's a golf pro game
in Riverdale. That's six.

1179
01:14:18,577 --> 01:14:20,670
- You sure you're up for this?
- I'm fucking up for this.

1180
01:14:20,746 --> 01:14:22,680
An 80.

1181
01:14:29,755 --> 01:14:32,280
I bet the full amount.

1182
01:14:32,358 --> 01:14:35,589
The full amount, huh?
Well, let me look at you here.

1183
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,930
Nope. You didn't do it this time.
I'm gonna raise you.

1184
01:14:52,911 --> 01:14:55,038
- [Woman] I don't know.
- [Man] The bet's 50.

1185
01:14:55,114 --> 01:14:57,742
[Woman]
I kinda like this robusto.

1186
01:14:57,816 --> 01:14:59,943
A nice, nutty finish.

1187
01:15:00,019 --> 01:15:05,457
I love the Cameroon wrapper
on this baby. Nice and oily.

1188
01:15:06,525 --> 01:15:09,983
I'll call.
What do you got?

1189
01:15:10,062 --> 01:15:12,030
I have what's
known as the wheel.

1190
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:16,329
It's got earthy tones, a smooth draw,
enough kick to win me the Hi and the Lo.

1191
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,838
Call.

1192
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:24,638
- Trip aces.
- L... I only got a pair.

1193
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:27,543
- Jacks.
- What did you think he had?

1194
01:15:27,613 --> 01:15:30,207
Does he look like a man
beaten by jacks?

1195
01:15:30,282 --> 01:15:33,740
Jacks are a monster compared
to the crap you play, Taki.

1196
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:37,755
- Ah, fuck you. Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

1197
01:15:37,823 --> 01:15:40,917
[Man]
It's only money. I bet.

1198
01:15:40,993 --> 01:15:43,655
[Mike]
Then let's get some in there.

1199
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:47,324
- Make it five.
- You're raising me 300, kid?

1200
01:15:48,901 --> 01:15:50,835
I call your 300.

1201
01:15:50,903 --> 01:15:54,498
- How much is in there, Weitz?
- About 1,500. 1,500.

1202
01:15:54,573 --> 01:15:57,770
[Man]
Here's a thousand. There's 500.

1203
01:15:57,843 --> 01:15:59,743
I bet you
the pot limit, kiddo.

1204
01:15:59,812 --> 01:16:02,042
[Weitz]
Are you sure on that, Goldie?

1205
01:16:02,114 --> 01:16:05,675
You might want to leave
a little something for
your daughter's riding lessons.

1206
01:16:05,751 --> 01:16:08,379
There's a lot more
where that came from, Weitz.

1207
01:16:12,024 --> 01:16:13,753
Take it down.

1208
01:16:13,826 --> 01:16:16,386
I got shit.
I bluffed the big ringer.

1209
01:16:16,462 --> 01:16:18,896
- [Laughing]
- [Worm] Let's go. Let's go.

1210
01:16:18,964 --> 01:16:22,730
Get up. Get off your ass.
We're done. Come on.

1211
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:25,702
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere...
Oh, by the way, anybody.

1212
01:16:25,771 --> 01:16:28,467
Buy some real jewelry,
you fucking cheap bastard.

1213
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,064
Unbelievable.

1214
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:32,906
- What were you doing in there?
- I didn't have it.

1215
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:34,912
You didn't have it?

1216
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,972
Since when you have to have it to
take a pot off a hump like that?

1217
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,985
- A grade schooler would've
played back at that guy.
- I was waiting the guy out.

1218
01:16:41,053 --> 01:16:43,988
Eventually, he was going to bluff
at the wrong pot. I was gonna take him.

1219
01:16:44,056 --> 01:16:48,015
We don't have time.
That guy was papier-mache.
You gotta make strong moves.

1220
01:16:48,093 --> 01:16:51,893
The move was folding. I can't lose
what I don't put in the middle.

1221
01:16:51,964 --> 01:16:55,866
Oh, Jesus, you know what?
Fuck all that 'cause we needed that pot.

1222
01:16:55,934 --> 01:16:58,266
Well, what
are we up to?

1223
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,174
That's like seven.
Seven.

1224
01:17:03,242 --> 01:17:06,211
With that pot you just dumped
on that fucking V-neck sweater,

1225
01:17:06,278 --> 01:17:08,212
we would've had ten.

1226
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,477
Look at you. One 64-hour session,
and you need a nap.

1227
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,984
- No time for a fucking nap.
- No, we don't. That's all right.

1228
01:17:14,052 --> 01:17:16,816
Come on.
I know what you need.

1229
01:17:16,889 --> 01:17:19,483
I know... I got just the place
for you. Yeah, yeah.

1230
01:17:19,558 --> 01:17:22,186
 [Man Singing In Italian]

1231
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:32,498
Feel like I'm gonna get whacked
sitting here like this.

1232
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:40,136
We got 7,300, Mike.
We gotta double that in two days.

1233
01:17:40,212 --> 01:17:44,649
Well, we're gonna get close. I'm sure
if we come up a little short, Grama...

1234
01:17:44,716 --> 01:17:47,150
We come up
even a little short,

1235
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:50,154
Grama will shoot us and bury us
in a hole somewhere.

1236
01:17:51,723 --> 01:17:54,351
Now, I know this game
up in Binghamton.

1237
01:17:54,426 --> 01:17:56,621
- In Binghamton?
- Yeah, yeah.

1238
01:17:56,695 --> 01:18:01,758
It's like 16 or 17 guys.
Two full tables. All municipal workers.

1239
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:05,827
They come play right after
they get their paychecks. It's very fat.

1240
01:18:05,904 --> 01:18:09,533
Are you sure? Binghamton's
five hours each way.

1241
01:18:09,608 --> 01:18:14,204
Well, look, I figure there's
15 or 20 grand in that room, okay?

1242
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:17,908
If we get even half of that,
we're home.

1243
01:18:17,983 --> 01:18:19,917
Lead me to it.

1244
01:18:30,395 --> 01:18:35,492
- Municipal workers, huh?
- What? These guys work for the city.

1245
01:18:35,567 --> 01:18:37,933
They work for the state,
you idiot.

1246
01:18:38,003 --> 01:18:41,200
Oh, this is
just stupid.

1247
01:18:41,273 --> 01:18:44,174
Look, we're here, okay?

1248
01:18:44,243 --> 01:18:48,441
- You got any better ideas?
- How the hell am I supposed
to even get in this game?

1249
01:18:48,513 --> 01:18:52,609
No, it's easy.
The whole time I was in the joint,
I was just dumping money to guards.

1250
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:57,178
This one guy, Pete Frye, I probably lost
like ten grand over 18 months.

1251
01:18:57,256 --> 01:18:59,724
I mean, he thinks
I'm a total fish.

1252
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,885
He told me anytime I wanted a game
when I got out, just look up his nephew.

1253
01:19:02,961 --> 01:19:06,590
You just go in there,
you ask for Sean Frye, you're in.

1254
01:19:06,665 --> 01:19:09,896
You're gonna clean this game up.
These guys are total suckers.

1255
01:19:09,968 --> 01:19:12,402
All right. Give me,
like, eight hours.

1256
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:16,066
- Come back at 7:00, 7:30.
- What am I gonna do for eight hours?

1257
01:19:16,141 --> 01:19:20,134
- Why don't I come in?
I'll sit for a little while.
- No.

1258
01:19:20,212 --> 01:19:24,444
- No, not a chance.
- I'll sit at the other table
and play straight.

1259
01:19:24,516 --> 01:19:28,247
You wanna play straight? You go
in there, I'll be back in eight hours.

1260
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:32,256
Aw, Jesus.

1261
01:19:32,324 --> 01:19:35,760
All right, all right. I'll go find
a fucking bowling alley.

1262
01:19:35,827 --> 01:19:37,454
I don't know.

1263
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:40,464
[Chattering]

1264
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,734
Excuse me.

1265
01:19:43,802 --> 01:19:47,863
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Sean Frye.

1266
01:19:50,275 --> 01:19:53,210
Yeah, right over there
in that cap.

1267
01:19:53,278 --> 01:19:55,212
Thanks.

1268
01:20:00,385 --> 01:20:02,319
Let's go.

1269
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:04,446
- Sean Frye?
- That's right.

1270
01:20:04,523 --> 01:20:08,289
Yeah, your Uncle Pete told me
to come by if I ever was around here.

1271
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,555
You one
of his students?

1272
01:20:12,664 --> 01:20:16,293
Oh, no, no, no, no.
l... I wasn't inside.

1273
01:20:16,368 --> 01:20:19,633
- You know him from hunting then, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, actually.

1274
01:20:19,705 --> 01:20:23,368
I met him over at, uh... He took me
for like a grand over at the lodge.

1275
01:20:23,442 --> 01:20:27,105
Well, that's the buy-in here.
We play 20-40 Stud.

1276
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:29,613
- Grab a seat.
- Great.

1277
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:41,558
- How you doing? I'm Mike.
- How you doing? Vitter.

1278
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:44,288
- Osborne.
- Hi.
- This is Whitley.

1279
01:20:44,363 --> 01:20:46,297
Bet 40.

- [Chips Hit Table]

1281
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,258
- All right.
- You and me, Mike.

1282
01:20:53,839 --> 01:20:55,773
Another 40.

1283
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:58,935
All right,
40 it is.

1284
01:21:00,712 --> 01:21:02,646
- Flush.
- Mm.

1285
01:21:02,714 --> 01:21:06,480
[Mike Narrating] Generally,
the rule is, the nicer the guy,
the poorer the card player.

1286
01:21:06,551 --> 01:21:09,987
And these guys, despite being cops,
are real sweethearts.

1287
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:14,150
I'm right on schedule,
up 4,200.

1288
01:21:14,226 --> 01:21:18,185
- The morning can't get here soon enough.
- [Men Laughing]

1289
01:21:18,263 --> 01:21:21,164
[Worm]
Holy shit! That's a hell of an elk.

1290
01:21:21,233 --> 01:21:23,895
My grandfather got that one.
Ain't that a beauty?

1291
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:26,028
- Hey, fellas.
- [All] Hey, Bear!

1292
01:21:26,104 --> 01:21:29,335
Met this guy down at the bowling alley.
Says he likes to play cards.

1293
01:21:29,408 --> 01:21:32,741
[Vitter]
Well, you've come to the right place.

1294
01:21:32,811 --> 01:21:35,371
This is Whitley. Osborne.
This guy's name is Mike.

1295
01:21:35,447 --> 01:21:38,007
- Mike? How are ya? Les Murphy.
- This is Vitter.

1296
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:40,415
- So, what are you guys playing?
- 20-40 Stud.

1297
01:21:40,485 --> 01:21:42,419
Okay.
Deal me in.

1298
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:44,853
All right,
your money's good here.

1299
01:21:44,923 --> 01:21:47,949
Give him some chips,
start playing some cards.

1300
01:21:48,026 --> 01:21:50,961
[Chattering]

1301
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:54,761
Everybody ante.

1302
01:21:59,371 --> 01:22:01,965
Let's play some cards.

1303
01:22:12,984 --> 01:22:16,750
- [Worm] Ace high bets.
- Well, I like what I have.

1304
01:22:16,822 --> 01:22:18,915
The bet is 20.

1305
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,322
I know that look.
I'm gonna fold.

1306
01:22:22,894 --> 01:22:24,828
Fold too.

1307
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,830
I'll take it.

1308
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,926
- Yeah, everybody ready? Fourth Street.
- Yes, sir.

1309
01:22:38,477 --> 01:22:40,411
Raise you.

1310
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:44,472
- I'm in.
- Wow. Wow. A lot of action.

1311
01:22:44,549 --> 01:22:48,781
A lot of action.

1312
01:22:52,057 --> 01:22:55,458
- I got the flush.
- Show me. What you got in here?

1313
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:01,529
- Jesus. Who wants more?
- I'm in.

1314
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,830
- I'm in.
- Come on, come on.

1315
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:06,370
I'm staging
a late-night comeback here.

1316
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:10,304
Late-night rally.

1317
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:14,505
Okay? Just to...
Just to warn you.

1318
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:17,878
Ace high bets.

1319
01:23:20,886 --> 01:23:22,683
Uh, ace checks.

1320
01:23:22,754 --> 01:23:26,690
- Check.
- Check on an ace. All right. I'll check.

1321
01:23:26,758 --> 01:23:28,692
- Check.
- Check.

1322
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,285
All right, free card.
Here we go.

1323
01:23:31,363 --> 01:23:33,957
- Hold on there a fucking second.
- Easy. What are you doing?

1324
01:23:34,032 --> 01:23:37,229
- Give me the deck.
- Relax, man. Don't get so agitated.

1325
01:23:37,302 --> 01:23:40,669
- [Vitter]
Looks like we got a road gang here.
- [Worm] A what?

1326
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:44,732
- What are you... What?
- What the hell's going
on over here, Stu?

1327
01:23:44,809 --> 01:23:46,902
This son of a bitch
is base dealing.

1328
01:23:46,978 --> 01:23:49,674
- Caught a hanger, Sarge.
- What? A hanger?

1329
01:23:49,748 --> 01:23:52,182
I don't even know
what you're saying.

1330
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:56,516
- He's saying you're dealing
off the bottom of the deck.
- Oh, God. Come on, guys.

1331
01:23:56,588 --> 01:23:58,954
- What did he give him?
- To me?

1332
01:23:59,024 --> 01:24:03,484
- Seven of hearts.
- You boys professionals? You working?

1333
01:24:03,562 --> 01:24:05,757
I was winning
before this guy got here.

1334
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:08,424
Okay, okay. Let's let the cards
do the talking.

1335
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,594
If the seven didn't help you,
we'll listen to what you have to say.

1336
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,400
Ozzy, turn the cards.

1337
01:24:14,472 --> 01:24:16,940
- [Murmuring]
- Come on! It's three of a kind!

1338
01:24:17,008 --> 01:24:19,943
- Shut up!
- I'm just sayin', it's three of a kind.

1339
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:22,343
One last thing, Stu.

1340
01:24:23,648 --> 01:24:25,582
- [Murmuring]
- Scumbag!

1341
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:27,584
Hey, all right,
take it easy.

1342
01:24:27,652 --> 01:24:30,052
Aren't you supposed
to read us our rights?

1343
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:31,884
Here's your fuckin' rights!

1344
01:24:31,957 --> 01:24:34,255
[All Shouting]

1345
01:24:35,794 --> 01:24:37,728
Fuck you!

1346
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:55,575
Get the fuck outta here,
you cocksuckers! Shit!

1347
01:24:57,315 --> 01:24:59,476
Aw, Jesus!

1348
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,754
Worm.

1349
01:25:06,224 --> 01:25:08,158
Worm?

1350
01:25:08,226 --> 01:25:10,160
[Mike Groans]

1351
01:25:10,228 --> 01:25:12,662
Hey, Les.

1352
01:25:12,731 --> 01:25:14,665
Hey.

1353
01:25:14,733 --> 01:25:17,293
Hey, you all right?

1354
01:25:17,369 --> 01:25:19,303
Mike?

1355
01:25:19,371 --> 01:25:21,305
Yeah.

1356
01:25:22,874 --> 01:25:25,308
You should've played
those kings, Mike.

1357
01:25:25,377 --> 01:25:28,210
- Aw, you're an asshole.
- [Groaning]

1358
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:32,182
I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

1359
01:25:33,752 --> 01:25:35,845
They took
every fucking nickel.

1360
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,515
I think I got 300
in my boot somewhere.

1361
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:44,221
Oh, look at you.
Fuck!

1362
01:25:44,296 --> 01:25:47,163
Fuck, I cannot believe
I caught a hanger.

1363
01:25:47,232 --> 01:25:52,033
- Aw, it's never happened,
I swear to God.
- Where's the car?

1364
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:55,300
- God, I think I cracked a rib.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

1365
01:25:55,373 --> 01:25:58,536
- I was trying to give us an edge.
- I had 'em.

1366
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:01,078
Hey, I'm sorry
we got banged up, all right?

1367
01:26:01,146 --> 01:26:03,580
I took a shot and I missed.
That happens.

1368
01:26:03,648 --> 01:26:07,311
- Fucking happens
all the time around you.
- What, it doesn't happen to you?

1369
01:26:07,385 --> 01:26:10,582
You're the guy who flushed his whole
fucking bankroll on one hand, Mike.

1370
01:26:10,655 --> 01:26:14,591
- Oh, hey, fuck you, man.
That was different.
- Why? Explain that to me.

1371
01:26:14,659 --> 01:26:17,753
Why different, huh?
What makes you so fucking special?

1372
01:26:17,829 --> 01:26:20,127
How come all your moves
are so smart and noble...

1373
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:22,564
and I'm always
the idiot piece of shit?

1374
01:26:22,634 --> 01:26:25,364
You act like you're the only one
with any fucking ambition.

1375
01:26:25,437 --> 01:26:28,998
What's your ambition, man? Tell me.
I don't know. What is it?

1376
01:26:29,074 --> 01:26:32,805
- I don't even know.
I don't think like that.
- No, you don't think.

1377
01:26:32,877 --> 01:26:34,811
No, I don't think
like you!

1378
01:26:34,879 --> 01:26:37,814
You always think you can beat the game
straight up. That's not me.

1379
01:26:37,882 --> 01:26:40,851
- I told you, I'm always gonna
look for that edge. Always.
- What's the edge now?

1380
01:26:40,919 --> 01:26:43,353
We owe 15 grand in a day.
What do we do?

1381
01:26:43,421 --> 01:26:46,254
It's easy. We get
the fuck outta Dodge, all right?

1382
01:26:46,324 --> 01:26:49,157
We just steer clear
of the city for a while.

1383
01:26:49,227 --> 01:26:52,560
We'll hit the road. We'll be up again
in no time. This'll all blow over.

1384
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:55,326
- We'll have a ball.
- Not a fucking chance
I'm gonna live like that.

1385
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,167
- You talk to Grama.
You get him to stake me.
- It's not gonna work, okay?

1386
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:02,832
We're not dealing with Grama.

1387
01:27:04,409 --> 01:27:07,503
You said
Grama's on his own.

1388
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:11,310
- You told me Grama's on his own.
- KGB bankrolled him.

1389
01:27:13,017 --> 01:27:17,579
- So you've just fucked us
right in the ass.
- Yeah, all the way, okay?

1390
01:27:17,655 --> 01:27:21,682
So you see what I'm saying?
No fooling around. It's highway time.

1391
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,161
Are you with me or not?

1392
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,528
No, I'm not this time.

1393
01:27:34,706 --> 01:27:38,699
- Give me the keys.
- You're really gonna go back there?

1394
01:27:39,778 --> 01:27:42,076
Yeah.

1395
01:27:43,348 --> 01:27:46,317
I'll see you
when I see you.

1396
01:27:48,353 --> 01:27:52,221
Hey. At least you're
rounding again, right?

1397
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:55,657
You're gonna thank me
for that someday.

1398
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:58,719
[Engine Starts]

1399
01:27:58,797 --> 01:28:01,664
[Car Driving Away]

1400
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:10,198
[Mike Narrating] Fold or hang tough.
Call or raise the bet.

1401
01:28:10,275 --> 01:28:13,369
These are decisions
you make at the table.

1402
01:28:13,445 --> 01:28:16,972
Sometimes the odds are stacked so clear,
there's only one way to play it.

1403
01:28:17,048 --> 01:28:21,109
Other times, like holding a small pair
against two over cards,

1404
01:28:21,186 --> 01:28:23,814
it's six to five,
or even money, either way.

1405
01:28:23,888 --> 01:28:27,449
Then it's all about feel,
what's in your guts.

1406
01:28:28,526 --> 01:28:30,494
Well, look at you.

1407
01:28:30,562 --> 01:28:32,860
Look at me.

1408
01:28:32,931 --> 01:28:34,956
Come in.

1409
01:28:35,033 --> 01:28:36,967
No.

1410
01:28:37,035 --> 01:28:41,495
- Where's your friend?
- Uh, he's gone.

1411
01:28:41,573 --> 01:28:45,509
- He's gone.
- So you brought my money?

1412
01:28:47,078 --> 01:28:51,139
- I'm a little short.
- How short?

1413
01:28:51,216 --> 01:28:52,979
The whole way.

1414
01:28:53,051 --> 01:28:56,111
There must be
some kind of story.

1415
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,881
Well...

1416
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:03,450
as you can see,
I can't pay you.

1417
01:29:03,528 --> 01:29:06,292
I see you're
banged up pretty good.

1418
01:29:10,635 --> 01:29:13,798
You never should've vouched
for that scumbag.

1419
01:29:16,941 --> 01:29:18,875
Maybe not.

1420
01:29:20,445 --> 01:29:23,846
- You're leaving me no outs here.
- Why?

1421
01:29:23,915 --> 01:29:27,476
I can't trust you two
aren't playing me.

1422
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:30,043
I'm not the one
working with a partner here.

1423
01:29:32,123 --> 01:29:36,389
You wanna take it up with KGB,
you go right ahead.

1424
01:29:36,461 --> 01:29:41,990
Otherwise, you got one day,
or this'll feel like a Swedish massage.

1425
01:29:42,066 --> 01:29:44,000
[Door Slams]

1426
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,443
- Hey.
- [Knish] Hey, what's up?

1427
01:30:11,996 --> 01:30:15,762
You look like Duane Bobick
after one round with Norton.

1428
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:20,770
- What the fuck happened to you?
- Ah, Worm.

1429
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:24,069
When are you
gonna listen?

1430
01:30:24,142 --> 01:30:26,610
I'm listening.

1431
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:30,478
What do you need?
500? A grand?

1432
01:30:30,548 --> 01:30:33,142
- Huh?
- I need... I need 15,000.

1433
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:35,777
- Fifteen?
- Yep.

1434
01:30:35,853 --> 01:30:38,947
I need a blow job
from Christy Turlington.

1435
01:30:39,023 --> 01:30:42,618
- Get the fuck outta here. $15,000?
- Seriously, Joey.

1436
01:30:42,694 --> 01:30:46,630
What can you do for me?
Five hundred dollars is not
even gonna get me started.

1437
01:30:46,698 --> 01:30:51,499
Goddamn it, Mike, if 500 won't
help, what's two grand gonna do?

1438
01:30:53,071 --> 01:30:55,631
What kind of trouble
you in?

1439
01:30:55,707 --> 01:30:58,767
I'm in the worst kind,
with the worst guy.

1440
01:30:58,843 --> 01:31:00,936
- KGB?
- Yep.

1441
01:31:03,014 --> 01:31:04,948
Come here.

1442
01:31:06,517 --> 01:31:08,781
Didn't I tell you...

1443
01:31:08,853 --> 01:31:11,754
to never let that guy
get a hold of you?

1444
01:31:11,823 --> 01:31:15,190
- You told me a lot of things.
- Yeah, yeah. And you don't listen.

1445
01:31:15,259 --> 01:31:18,194
I tell you to play within your means,
you risk your whole bankroll.

1446
01:31:18,262 --> 01:31:20,753
I tell you not to
overextend yourself, to rebuild,

1447
01:31:20,832 --> 01:31:23,232
you go into hock for more.

1448
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:25,861
I was giving you
a living, Mike,

1449
01:31:25,937 --> 01:31:29,373
showing you the playbook
I put together off my own beats.

1450
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,374
That wasn't enough
for you...

1451
01:31:31,442 --> 01:31:35,310
This is one time I don't need
you to tell me how I fucked up.

1452
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,314
I know I fucked up.

1453
01:31:37,382 --> 01:31:40,351
What I need from you
is money.

1454
01:31:40,418 --> 01:31:43,319
- I need whatever money you can give me.
- See, that's the thing.

1455
01:31:43,388 --> 01:31:45,982
This time
there is no money.

1456
01:31:46,057 --> 01:31:49,549
I give you two grand,
what's that buy you? A day?

1457
01:31:49,627 --> 01:31:51,822
No, I give it to you,
I'm wasting it.

1458
01:31:51,896 --> 01:31:54,660
- That's fucking great.
- You did it to yourself.

1459
01:31:54,732 --> 01:31:57,667
You had to put it all on the line
for some Vegas pipe dream.

1460
01:31:57,735 --> 01:31:59,760
Yeah, I took a risk.
I took a risk.

1461
01:31:59,837 --> 01:32:02,328
You see all the angles.
You never have the stones to play one.

1462
01:32:02,407 --> 01:32:06,207
"Stones"?
You little punk.

1463
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:09,110
I'm not playing for the thrill
of fucking victory here.

1464
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:14,447
I owe rent, alimony, child support.
I play for money.

1465
01:32:14,519 --> 01:32:16,453
My kids eat.

1466
01:32:16,521 --> 01:32:18,989
I got stones enough
not to chase cards, action...

1467
01:32:19,057 --> 01:32:22,857
or fucking pipe dreams
of winning the World Series on ESPN.

1468
01:32:22,927 --> 01:32:25,555
You want me to, uh,
call some people,

1469
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:27,791
try and buy you
some time, I will.

1470
01:32:27,865 --> 01:32:30,356
Place to stay, or the truck.
No problem.

1471
01:32:30,435 --> 01:32:34,804
But about the money,
I gotta do this. I gotta say no.

1472
01:32:34,872 --> 01:32:38,467
That's fine.
I understand.

1473
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:44,273
- Hey, listen.
- What?

1474
01:32:44,348 --> 01:32:46,942
I put it all on the line.
That's true.

1475
01:32:47,018 --> 01:32:50,681
And you know what?
It wasn't a bad beat.

1476
01:32:50,755 --> 01:32:52,746
I wasn't unlucky.

1477
01:32:52,824 --> 01:32:55,657
I got outplayed.
I got outplayed that time.

1478
01:32:57,228 --> 01:33:00,254
But I know I'm good enough
to sit at that table.

1479
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:02,799
It's not... It's not
a fucking pipe dream.

1480
01:33:02,867 --> 01:33:05,335
I don't doubt your talent.

1481
01:33:05,403 --> 01:33:08,429
I never...
I never told anybody this.

1482
01:33:08,506 --> 01:33:12,602
About eight, nine months ago,
I'm at the Taj, it's late,

1483
01:33:12,677 --> 01:33:14,702
and I see Johnny Chan
walk in.

1484
01:33:14,779 --> 01:33:16,713
And he goes,
he sits 300-600.

1485
01:33:16,781 --> 01:33:19,614
And the whole place stops
when Johnny Chan walks in.

1486
01:33:19,684 --> 01:33:21,777
Everybody puts
an eye on him.

1487
01:33:21,853 --> 01:33:24,287
After a little while,
there wasn't a crap game going...

1488
01:33:24,355 --> 01:33:26,789
'cause all the high rollers
are over there watching him.

1489
01:33:26,858 --> 01:33:29,691
Some are playing with him, giving
away their money to this guy to say...

1490
01:33:29,761 --> 01:33:31,695
"Oh, I played
with the World Champion."

1491
01:33:31,763 --> 01:33:34,698
And you know what I did?
I sat down.

1492
01:33:34,766 --> 01:33:38,463
Nah, you need 50, 60 grand
to play right in that game.

1493
01:33:38,536 --> 01:33:41,027
Well, I had six,
but I had to know.

1494
01:33:41,105 --> 01:33:43,039
What happened?

1495
01:33:43,107 --> 01:33:46,372
Played tight for an hour. I folded
mostly, and then I made a score.

1496
01:33:46,444 --> 01:33:49,811
- Wired aces or kings?
- Rags.

1497
01:33:51,115 --> 01:33:54,607
I had nothing.
But he raised.

1498
01:33:54,685 --> 01:33:57,279
And I just decided, you know,
I don't care about the money.

1499
01:33:57,355 --> 01:33:59,619
I'm just gonna
outplay the guy.

1500
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:02,352
I'm just gonna outplay
this guy this hand.

1501
01:34:02,426 --> 01:34:05,122
- I re-raised.
- Re-raise.

1502
01:34:05,196 --> 01:34:07,960
- You played right back at him, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

1503
01:34:08,032 --> 01:34:10,523
And he just comes right
back over the top of me,

1504
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:13,126
trying to bully me like
I'm some fucking tourist.

1505
01:34:13,204 --> 01:34:15,138
I hesitate for two seconds.
I re-raised.

1506
01:34:15,206 --> 01:34:18,175
And he makes a move toward his checks,
and he looks at me.

1507
01:34:18,242 --> 01:34:21,678
And he looks at his cards,
and he looks at me again.

1508
01:34:21,746 --> 01:34:24,977
And he mucked it.
I took it down.

1509
01:34:25,049 --> 01:34:29,918
"Did you have it?"
"I'm sorry, John. I don't remember."

1510
01:34:31,756 --> 01:34:34,589
I got up, and I walked
to the cashier.

1511
01:34:34,659 --> 01:34:38,220
I sat with the best
in the world, and I won.

1512
01:34:38,296 --> 01:34:42,164
You put a fucking move on Chan,
you son of a bitch.

1513
01:34:42,233 --> 01:34:45,361
So that's why you made
that run on KGB's place.

1514
01:34:45,436 --> 01:34:47,870
That's right.

1515
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:50,601
And I'll do it again
if I can.

1516
01:34:52,276 --> 01:34:54,710
Well, then I'm rooting
for you, Mike.

1517
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:57,748
I'll see you around,
Knish.

1518
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:03,310
This is temporary?
Will you be back next semester?

1519
01:35:03,387 --> 01:35:06,618
Oh, I think we
both know I'm no lawyer.

1520
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:10,659
I hope my story
didn't discourage you.

1521
01:35:10,728 --> 01:35:15,756
No. It inspired me.
I think I was on my way out anyway.

1522
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:18,859
- But now you're here.
- That's right.

1523
01:35:18,936 --> 01:35:22,531
- You're in trouble?
- Yes, sir, I am.

1524
01:35:22,607 --> 01:35:27,442
Uh, not with the law.
I owe.

1525
01:35:27,511 --> 01:35:31,379
- A gambling debt?
- Yeah.

1526
01:35:31,449 --> 01:35:36,443
It's not mine. It's, uh...
I vouched for the wrong guy.

1527
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,284
Um, so now it's on me.

1528
01:35:39,357 --> 01:35:41,291
I understand.

1529
01:35:43,361 --> 01:35:46,387
So, what will it take
for you to be free of this?

1530
01:35:48,566 --> 01:35:51,729
- I need 15,000 tonight.
- Michael!

1531
01:35:51,802 --> 01:35:54,566
Michael!

1532
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:01,569
- You know, I'm not
a wealthy man, Michael.
- I know.

1533
01:36:01,646 --> 01:36:05,047
And it kills me
to ask you, but...

1534
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:07,914
I don't have
any other play here.

1535
01:36:07,985 --> 01:36:11,148
So, uh, if you can
help me at all...

1536
01:36:11,222 --> 01:36:13,281
I hate to see you
like this.

1537
01:36:13,357 --> 01:36:15,791
I want to help you, Michael.
But $15,000, l... l...

1538
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,725
I know.

1539
01:36:17,795 --> 01:36:19,729
[Sighs]

1540
01:36:24,435 --> 01:36:26,494
If it must be tonight,

1541
01:36:28,072 --> 01:36:31,098
then ten
is the best I can do.

1542
01:36:32,677 --> 01:36:34,770
Would you do that?

1543
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,344
When my mother
let me leave the yeshiva,

1544
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:45,184
it nearly broke her.

1545
01:36:45,256 --> 01:36:49,488
But she knew...
She knew the life I had to lead.

1546
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:54,326
To do that for another
is a mitzvah.

1547
01:36:57,201 --> 01:37:00,602
And for that, I owe.

1548
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:18,381
So you take this money...

1549
01:37:18,456 --> 01:37:21,425
and you get yourself
out of this trouble.

1550
01:37:21,492 --> 01:37:23,426
You hear me?

1551
01:37:28,532 --> 01:37:30,864
I know you can.

1552
01:37:33,537 --> 01:37:37,871
l... I promise that I'm gonna...
I'll pay you back.

1553
01:37:38,943 --> 01:37:40,877
Good luck.

1554
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,834
[Mike Narrating]
I've often seen these people,
these squares, at the table.

1555
01:38:06,904 --> 01:38:11,068
Short-stacked and long odds against,
all their outs gone,

1556
01:38:11,142 --> 01:38:13,838
one last card in the deck
that can help them.

1557
01:38:15,546 --> 01:38:19,915
I used to wonder how they could let
themselves get into such bad shape...

1558
01:38:19,984 --> 01:38:23,181
and how the hell they thought
they could turn it around.

1559
01:38:30,194 --> 01:38:32,685
Just walking in here
makes me queasy.

1560
01:38:32,763 --> 01:38:35,891
The brick walls.
The fucking mopes at the tables.

1561
01:38:35,966 --> 01:38:40,164
The musty smell. I feel like Buckner
walking back into Shea.

1562
01:38:40,237 --> 01:38:42,728
But what choice do I have?

1563
01:38:42,807 --> 01:38:45,640
So, you have my money?

1564
01:38:45,709 --> 01:38:48,610
- I owe you that money tomorrow, right?
- Da.

1565
01:38:50,181 --> 01:38:52,308
So it's still mine.

1566
01:38:52,383 --> 01:38:57,411
For the next eight hours,
it is yours.

1567
01:38:57,488 --> 01:39:00,821
But if you
don't have it all by then,

1568
01:39:00,891 --> 01:39:03,655
then you are mine.

1569
01:39:03,727 --> 01:39:05,661
Well...

1570
01:39:10,634 --> 01:39:15,298
I got $10,000.
I'm looking for a game.

1571
01:39:16,507 --> 01:39:19,635
- You sure?
- You heard me.

1572
01:39:23,247 --> 01:39:26,444
So, we'll play. Heads up.

1573
01:39:26,517 --> 01:39:29,714
We both start
with a couple of racks.

1574
01:39:29,787 --> 01:39:33,518
Blinds, uh, 25 and 50?

1575
01:39:33,591 --> 01:39:38,255
And we don't stop
until one of us has it all.

1576
01:39:40,331 --> 01:39:43,198
Let's do it.

1577
01:39:43,267 --> 01:39:46,202
[Cards Shuffling]

1578
01:40:08,058 --> 01:40:10,856
I'm gonna raise.

1579
01:40:10,928 --> 01:40:12,987
Thousand straight.

1580
01:40:13,063 --> 01:40:15,554
Very aggressive.

1581
01:40:15,633 --> 01:40:18,363
A new day.

1582
01:40:18,435 --> 01:40:22,235
And you won't be pushed around.
[Chuckling]

1583
01:40:22,306 --> 01:40:26,037
But... I re-raise.

1584
01:40:26,110 --> 01:40:29,910
Five thousand.

1585
01:40:31,982 --> 01:40:34,849
[Mike Narrating] Doyle Brunson says,
"The key to No-Limit...

1586
01:40:34,919 --> 01:40:37,649
is to put a man to a decision
for all his chips."

1587
01:40:37,721 --> 01:40:39,655
Teddy's just done it.

1588
01:40:39,723 --> 01:40:42,886
He's representing aces,
the only hand better than my cowboys.

1589
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,690
I can't call and give him
a chance to catch.

1590
01:40:45,763 --> 01:40:48,857
I can only fold,
if I believe him. Or...

1591
01:40:48,933 --> 01:40:51,333
I re-raise. I'm all in.

1592
01:41:21,932 --> 01:41:24,025
Take it down.

1593
01:41:31,976 --> 01:41:33,910
In a heads-up match,

1594
01:41:33,978 --> 01:41:38,142
the size of your stack is almost as
important as the quality of your cards.

1595
01:41:38,215 --> 01:41:40,809
I chopped one of his legs out
in the first hand.

1596
01:41:40,884 --> 01:41:45,184
- Now all I have to do is lean
on him until he falls over.
- Check.

1597
01:41:45,256 --> 01:41:47,724
Bet a thousand.

1598
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:50,817
Call. I'll call.

1599
01:41:54,698 --> 01:41:56,290
Check.

1600
01:41:57,868 --> 01:42:01,497
What's that, 2,500 there?
I'm gonna tap your tap.

1601
01:42:11,181 --> 01:42:12,648
Jacks up.

1602
01:42:15,085 --> 01:42:17,019
Very good.

1603
01:42:18,722 --> 01:42:21,020
Good hand.

1604
01:42:21,091 --> 01:42:25,494
Catching that Jack
on the turn.

1605
01:42:25,562 --> 01:42:30,192
- You got lucky there.
- Yep, it was luck.

1606
01:42:30,267 --> 01:42:34,260
So, that's it then, hmm?

1607
01:42:34,338 --> 01:42:39,366
Just like a young man
coming in for a quickie.

1608
01:42:39,443 --> 01:42:44,210
I feel so unsatisfied.

1609
01:42:44,281 --> 01:42:46,215
I'm sorry.

1610
01:42:46,283 --> 01:42:50,014
You must feel proud
and good.

1611
01:42:50,087 --> 01:42:53,181
Strong enough
to beat the world.

1612
01:42:54,758 --> 01:42:59,422
- I feel fine.
- Me too. I feel okay.

1613
01:43:00,931 --> 01:43:04,458
'Course maybe we check
with one other guy, see how he feels.

1614

Grama!

1615
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,474
I thought I smelled him.

1616
01:43:12,543 --> 01:43:14,909
I'll take what's ours.

1617
01:43:14,978 --> 01:43:17,845
'Course you could
let it ride, Mike.

1618

Take your chances.
You could let this happen, Grama?

1619
01:43:21,051 --> 01:43:23,076
Sure, partner.

01:43:23,153 --> 01:43:26,350
He still has till morning
to make good.

1621
01:43:26,423 --> 01:43:31,884
Uh, you know what? I got my
five grand here. That's just fine by me.

1622
01:43:31,962 --> 01:43:35,193
- I'm going home.
- Fine.

1623
01:43:35,265 --> 01:43:37,597
It's a fucking joke anyway.

1624
01:43:37,668 --> 01:43:42,332
After all, I am paying you
with your money.

1625
01:43:45,242 --> 01:43:48,643
- What did you say?
- Your money.

1626
01:43:48,712 --> 01:43:52,148
I am still up 20 grand...

1627
01:43:52,216 --> 01:43:55,777
from this last time
I stick it in you.

1628
01:43:55,853 --> 01:44:00,051
[Mike Narrating] They're trying
to goad me, trying to own me.

1629
01:44:00,124 --> 01:44:05,221
But this isn't a gunfight.
It's not about pride or ego.
It's only about money.

1630
01:44:05,295 --> 01:44:08,992
I can leave now,
even with Grama and KGB...

1631
01:44:09,066 --> 01:44:12,524
and halfway
to paying Petrovsky back.

1632
01:44:12,603 --> 01:44:14,537
That's the safe play.

1633
01:44:14,605 --> 01:44:18,302
I told Worm you can't lose
what you don't put in the middle.

1634
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:22,209
- Deal 'em.
- But you can't win much either.

for not walking out
when you could.

1642
01:45:04,154 --> 01:45:06,588
Bad judgment.

1643
01:45:06,657 --> 01:45:08,852
But...

1644
01:45:08,926 --> 01:45:11,292
don't you worry, son.

1645
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:15,354
It will all be over soon.

Okay.

Check.

01:45:50,267 --> 01:45:53,828
No check here.
I tap you.

1649
01:46:08,652 --> 01:46:10,984
I'm laying
this down, Teddy.

Top two pair.

1651
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:18,450
It's a monster hand,
and I'm gonna lay that down...

1652
01:46:18,529 --> 01:46:22,488
'cause you got two-four, and I'm
not gonna draw against a made hand.

1654
01:46:37,414 --> 01:46:40,008
Should have paid me off
on that.

lay that down?

The rule is this:

1660
01:47:13,717 --> 01:47:17,016
You spot a man's tell,
you don't say a fucking word.

1661
01:47:17,087 --> 01:47:19,021
I finally spotted KGB's.

1662
01:47:19,089 --> 01:47:23,389
And usually I would've let him
go on chewing those Oreos
till he was dead broke.

1663
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:28,261
But I don't have that kind of time.
I've only got till morning.

Not even Teddy KGB's immune
to getting a little rattled.

All right, I'll call the two grand.
I'll gamble.

Don't splash the pot.

You're on a draw, Mike?
Go away.

is not good for you.

1677

And in my club, I will splash the pot
whenever the fuck I please.

1678

That's right.

That's 4,400.

01:49:12,569 --> 01:49:15,936
All right, I'm gonna call you, or else
I won't respect myself tomorrow morning.

Respect is all you'll have left
in the morning.

Last card coming.

1689
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:37,786
Check.

1690
01:49:37,861 --> 01:49:41,388
It hurts, doesn't it?

1691
01:49:41,465 --> 01:49:45,663
You can't believe
what fell.

1692
01:49:45,736 --> 01:49:49,228
All your dreams... dashed.

the fucking drain.

right beside you.

have helped you.

You're right, Teddy.
The ace didn't help me.

1699
01:50:18,735 --> 01:50:21,135

a nut straight.

Pay that man his money.

Turned my ten grand
into just over 60.

1714

Paid 15 to Grama, six went back
to the Chesterfield.

1715

As for Worm,
well, I figure we're even.

And after the ten going back
to the professor,

01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:08,642
I'm back where I started,
with three stacks of high society.

seen me yesterday.

- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. You?

Now I am.

So, you're
outta here, huh?

01:52:42,879 --> 01:52:48,579
Yeah, I'm... I figure
there's nothing left for me here.

give this to Petrovsky?

It's still a little early.

01:54:55,278 --> 01:54:58,441
 Da, da, da, da, yeah 

1747
01:54:59,949 --> 01:55:03,908
 La, la, la, la, la
la, la, yeah 

1748
01:55:06,056 --> 01:55:10,117
 Gonna get out
on the road tonight 

1749
01:55:10,193 --> 01:55:14,323
 'Cause I got a hollow
in my head 

1750
01:55:14,397 --> 01:55:19,562
 Just checkin' it up, baby
one more time for you 

1751
01:55:19,636 --> 01:55:25,632
 Checkin' it up until
the pile hits the sky 

1752
01:55:25,708 --> 01:55:30,372
 It's like I think
I'm sick of cocaine 

1753
01:55:30,447 --> 01:55:34,975
 But l, I got a feelin' like
it's runnin' in my veins 

1754
01:55:35,051 --> 01:55:40,455
 Just checkin' it up, baby
one more time for you 

1755
01:55:40,523 --> 01:55:45,222
 Checkin' it up until
the pile hits the sky 

1756
01:55:45,295 --> 01:55:49,163
 Even the best years
leave a lot to be desired 

1757
01:55:49,232 --> 01:55:52,565
 And then they've
passed you by 

1758
01:55:57,674 --> 01:56:00,234
 All these seasons 

1759
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:05,441
 All this time spinnin' past
till they leave you 

1760
01:56:05,515 --> 01:56:07,540
 Far behind 

1761
01:56:07,617 --> 01:56:12,577
 Lay me down in the circle
where the spotlight shines 

1762
01:56:12,655 --> 01:56:19,618
 'Cause all this pleasure
gets me high 

1763
01:56:25,735 --> 01:56:27,760
 Da, da, da, da 

1764
01:56:27,837 --> 01:56:30,362
 Da, da, da, da 

1765
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,307
 Da, da, da, da, yeah 

1766
01:56:33,376 --> 01:56:35,640
 Da, da, da, da 

1767
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:39,808
 Some people will cut you
till you're bleedin' 

1768
01:56:39,883 --> 01:56:44,217
 Not me 'cause I just
wanna do it to myself 

1769
01:56:44,287 --> 01:56:49,782
 I'm just checkin' it up, baby
one more time for you 

1770
01:56:49,859 --> 01:56:55,297
 Checkin' it up until
the pile hits the sky 

1771
01:56:55,365 --> 01:56:58,027
 Even the best years
are a waste of time 

1772
01:56:58,101 --> 01:57:02,936
 But, baby
I'm a big star now 

1773
01:57:03,006 --> 01:57:06,874
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

1774
01:57:06,943 --> 01:57:10,003
 All these seasons 

1775
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:15,176
 All this time spinnin' past
till they leave you 

1776
01:57:15,251 --> 01:57:17,185
 Far behind 

1777
01:57:17,253 --> 01:57:22,213
 Lay me down in the circle
where the spotlight shines 

1778
01:57:22,292 --> 01:57:31,928
 'Cause all this pleasure
gets me high 

1779
01:57:32,001 --> 01:57:34,902
 Oh, oh 

1780
01:57:34,971 --> 01:57:37,462
 Da, da, da, da 

1781
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:40,407
 Da, da, da, da, ha 

1782
01:57:40,476 --> 01:57:41,966
 Da, da, da, da 

1783
01:57:42,045 --> 01:57:44,411
 A-da, a-da, da 

1784
01:58:26,789 --> 01:58:30,054
 All these seasons 

1785
01:58:30,126 --> 01:58:34,961
 All this time spinnin' past
till they leave you 

1786
01:58:35,031 --> 01:58:36,965
 Far behind 

1787
01:58:37,033 --> 01:58:42,198
 Lay me down in the circle
where the spotlight shines 

1788
01:58:42,272 --> 01:58:47,039
 Turn your back on the people
who draw the lines 

1789
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:52,275
 Put your faith in the answers
that you can't find 

1790
01:58:52,348 --> 01:58:56,978
 Hit the ground hard, runnin'
down that highway line 

1791
01:58:57,053 --> 01:59:02,650
 Say a prayer for the ones
you have left behind 

1792
01:59:02,725 --> 01:59:10,962
 'Cause all this pleasure
gets them high 

1793
01:59:11,034 --> 01:59:13,969
 A-ha, ha, ha 

1794
01:59:15,838 --> 01:59:17,965
 Da, da, da, da 

1795
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:20,771
 Da, da, da, da 

1796
01:59:20,843 --> 01:59:23,710
 Da, da, da, da, ah 

1797
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:26,476
 'Cause I don't wanna
give it back, no 

1798
01:59:26,549 --> 01:59:28,881
 And I don't wanna
give it back, no 

1799
01:59:28,951 --> 01:59:31,681
 Said I don't wanna
give it back, oh

 Oh, I don't wanna

 Oh, oh, no, no, no, no
