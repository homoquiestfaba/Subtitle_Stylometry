1
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,177
Oh, my God!

2
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:08,144
Come on, Em, Bobby doesn't care.

3
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,548
-Well, l care.
-Just relax.

4
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,550
Kiss my ass.

5
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,220
l'll call you later, okay?

6
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:20,261
Okay.

7
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,127
Hop in.

8
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:38,012
-Are you freaked out?
-No.

9
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:40,172
A little.

10
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,547
lt's just love, man.

11
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,517
lt's nothing to fear.

12
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:49,554
We need to find you a woman.

13
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:53,025
You're 9.
You've been a virgin too long.

14
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,326
We'll find you a woman in the sixth grade.
Somebody with a little experience.

15
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,027
Okay.

16
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,430
Come here.

17
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,526

18
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,046
lt's windowpane.

19
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,205
For clarity of vision.

20
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,877
Cin-cin.

21
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,142
She's my favorite.

22
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,437
Yeah, she's a beauty.

23
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,011
-How you feeling?
-Okay.

24
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,616
-Tell me when you feel more than okay.
-l will.

25
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,752
Come on, l got something to show you.

26
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,359
lt's a good place to come when things
get a little tilty back home.

27
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,932
My son...

28
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,806
...this is your inheritance.

29
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:07,656
There's nothing to be afraid of
in this whole pretty world, Bobby.

30
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,756
l'm here.

31
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,330
All is well, yes?

32
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,415
This is where we live.

33
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,068
-l can see our house from here.
-Come on down, man.

34
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:50,865
l can see the school too!

35
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:54,237
-Come on.
-l can see tomorrow from here.

36
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,071
How's it look?

37
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:57,836
Pretty.

38
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,307
Big, pretty world, man.

39
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,314
Everything can happen.

40
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,994
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, lsabel.

41
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:17,496
Lou! Jerry! Hi, how are you?
What are you drinking?

42
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:23,336
Oh, Mr. Right,
if you were only 30 years older....

43
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,848
Hi, little guy.

44
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:38,982
-l love Jefferson Airplane, man.
-Dig.

45
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,386
Hey, queen of the night.

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,160
Oh, Bobby. Come on, time for bed.
Go on.

47
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,924
-Right.
-Bobby, bed. Now.

48
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,726
No!

49
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,927
Good night, man.

50
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,037
Oh, come on.

51
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:58,002
-No, no!
-Stop that.

52
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,938
-No, no, no!
-Don't be an asshole, man.

53
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,578
-Don't fuck things up.
-Go on.

54
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,707
Carlton, don't say ''fuck.''

55
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:22,656
Fuck you.

56
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:29,634
Mom needs a break tonight, buddy.

57
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,805
Your mission is to pass as a 9-year-old
till further notice.

58
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,809
But l'm missing everything.

59
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,349
There's always more, pal.

60
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:43,107
-A flying saucer.
-What?

61
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:45,948
There's a flying saucer.
lt's above the back yard!

62
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:48,556
lt's gonna land!

63
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,617
So where is it?

64
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,597
-You mean that airplane?
-l know what an airplane looks like.

65
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:57,823
You're an idiot, Frank.

66
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,663
Hey, aliens!

67
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,333
Come back!

68
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,598
l'm ready to go home now!

69
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,678
Hello, beautiful.

70
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,153
Carlton!

71
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,284
Oh, my God!

72
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,931
Oh, my God.

73
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:16,206
-Somebody call an ambulance!
-You're gonna be all right, okay?

74
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,404
My baby! Oh, my God, my baby!

75
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,674
You're gonna be all right. lt's okay.

76
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,750
lt's okay. lt's okay.

77
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,651
-Hey, man.
-Hi.

78
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,518
High school.

79
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:05,754
Yeah.

80
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:11,028
Nice jacket.

81
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,633
Thanks.

82
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,102
Hey, man.

83
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,910
Oh, hi.

84
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,304
Wanna smoke a joint?

85
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,451
Well, l guess so.

86
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,019
Yes.

87
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,778
Let's go.

88
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,420
l don't think this is working.

89
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,596
Be patient, man.

90
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:53,831
This is definitely not working.
l feel just like l always do.

91
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:58,644
So, Bobby, you new in town?

92
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:01,712
No, sir. l've been here all my life.

93
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:04,075
Just been sort of...

94
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,055
...invisible.

95
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,520
-Well, welcome to the material world.
-Well, thank you, sir.

96
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,825
You made this bread?

97
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:20,401
Bread's a hobby of mine.
l can just about do it in my sleep.

98
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:23,162
So, what's your father do?

99
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,638
-He's a teacher, over at Fillmore.
-Your mother, does she work?

100
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,335
No. l mean...

101
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:31,207
...she died last year.

102
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,939
Oh, l'm so sorry.

103
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:37,051
You shouldn't be sorry.
You didn't even know her.

104
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:38,947
Well, l--

105
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,816
l meant....

106
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,249
l meant it in a more general way.
l meant l'm--

107
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,154
l'm sorry for your loss.

108
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,229
This is really good bread.

109
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:54,599
l really like your jacket.

110
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,294
lt's my brother's.

111
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,067
lt's cool.

112
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,036
He died too.

113
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,278
You wanna borrow it?

114
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,983
Here, go on.

115
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:22,229
lt fits you, man.

116
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:24,394
Wait a minute.

117
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,339
Here.

118
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:34,700
Take this.

119
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:44,282
Fits.

120
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,616
Hey, Dad.

121
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:51,452
-Boys?
-Shit!

122
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,747
Come on in, Mrs. Glover.

123
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:58,818
Sorry to intrude. l was just wondering,
what's that music?

124
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,286
lt's Laura Nyro.

125
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,169
Well...

126
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:12,038
...nobody wants a mother hanging around.

127
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,233
Bye, Mom.

128
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,508
Put that out. Please. You boys
are gonna get into trouble.

129
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,581
Mrs. Glover.

130
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:22,740
You've been so nice to me.

131
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,881
l was wondering....

132
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,215
You want a hit?

133
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,547
l do not.

134
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,191
There's nothing to fear. lt's all goodness.

135
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,696
l'm Jonathan's mother.

136
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:37,765
-Bobby, l don't really think--
-But...

137
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,467
...you're also...

138
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,192
...like....

139
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,482
Don't you dare tell your father.

140
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,420
What do l do?

141
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,423
Just pull the smoke
straight into your lungs.

142
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:11,524
That always happens.

143
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,066
Here, try again.

144
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,507
Good. That's good.

145
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:27,581
Now hold it.

146
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,624
What...?

147
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,263
What will it do, exactly?

148
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:52,368
l mean, what should l prepare myself for?

149
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:57,041
lt'll just make you laugh,
make you feel, you know, happy...

150
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,847
...and a little foolish.

151
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,213
Mrs. Glover?

152
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,584
This is so cool.

153
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:12,553
She sounds so sad.

154
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,987
She's the goddess.

155
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,792
l heard her singing, and l just--

156
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,136
l don't know.

157
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,568
She just sounds so beautiful...

158
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,270
...and lonely.

159
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,716
Mom?

160
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,417
Oh, thanks, dear.

161
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:50,823
We're all, you know,
beautiful and lonely here.

162
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,298
Come on, let's dance.

163
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,000
No.

164
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,769
-Absolutely not.
-Can't take no.

165
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,640
Look what you're making an old lady do.

166
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,347
-You're a good dancer.
-Well, l used to be...

167
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,786
...in the early Pleistocene.

168
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,089
Bobby, if you get cold,
there's a comforter in the hall closet.

169
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,955
-Thanks, Mrs. Glover.
-Okay.

170
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,290
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night.

171
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,900
The Stones are coming in March.

172
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:26,006
We've gotta get tickets.

173
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,199
We should go all three nights.

174
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,964
Dad?

175
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,945
Dad, it's getting late.

176
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,709
My angel.

177
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,440
-You poor baby.
-Thanks.

178
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:39,546
Sure thing.

179
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,486
So...

180
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,050
...that's it, man.

181
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,224
l'm like...

182
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:55,859
...the last of my kind now.

183
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,633
No, you're not.

184
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,901
l wish l'd been with him.

185
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,127
lt's all right.

186
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:51,515
Oh, mama, no. Life can't be this good.

187
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:03,520
Your father took me to see this
on our second or third date.

188
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:09,332
-Blessings on our Friday.
-What do you want to do?

189
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:13,304
-Something huge.
-There's nothing huge around here.

190
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:18,435
-You took your dad's car?
-Just a little spin, man.

191
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:56,015
Hey, can l hitch a ride?

192
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:02,086
Shit! Get out of here!
Get out of here right now!

193
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,928
-Shit. Shit.
-Jon. Jon.

194
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,188
-l gotta go.
-This is where you live.

195
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,231
This is all fucked up.

196
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,194
l guess we let things get--

197
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:46,256
-l mean--
-lt's love, man.

198
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,128
-lt's just love.
-We got carried away...

199
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:52,466
...and l think we should stop.

200
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,972
l mean, pretty soon we'll be out
of high school.

201
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:57,736
Then we'll be in college.

202
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,677
And l want to go to college in a big city.

203
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:09,115
-You're gonna go away?
-As soon as l can.

204
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,434
You're awake.

205
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:28,666
l just--

206
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,579
l wanted a drink of water.

207
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:38,211
l couldn't sleep either, so l decided
l might as well do something useful.

208
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:51,464
Maybe l shouldn't stay here anymore.

209
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:56,034
l'm not innocent in all this, Bobby.

210
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:59,135
l can't pretend to be.

211
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,711
l honestly don't know what to do.

212
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:06,740
l'm supposed to be the mother.

213
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,179
l'm the adult here...

214
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,852
...and l honestly don't...

215
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:15,883
...have the slightest idea what to do
or say to either one of you.

216
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,954
l should go...

217
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,051
...l guess.

218
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:29,031
Want to learn how to make a pie?

219
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:36,368
Sometimes it's good to just do
a simple, useful thing.

220
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:40,236
-l don't know.
-l haven't rolled out the second crust yet.

221
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:48,151
lt's not like bread dough. You mold that
until it comes to life.

222
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:51,258
Pie crust is just the opposite.

223
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:56,159
lt needs kid gloves. You handle it
as little as possible.

224
00:26:56,998 --> 00:27:01,867
You'd be surprised how easy it is
once you learn a few of the tricks.

225
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,248
Just coax it.

226
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,950
That's right.

227
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,385
That's good.

228
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,226
That's very good.

229
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,579
At least Alice and l will never have to suffer
through another Cleveland winter.

230
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,753
You'll do better in Arizona, Ned.

231
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,913
Yep. New beginnings.

232
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,949
Just wish it wasn't so far.

233
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:02,893
No, man, Jonathan can just hop in a plane
from New York any time, and l'll be there.

234
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:04,729
Bobby...

235
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:06,264
...son...

236
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,263
...you can't move...

237
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:14,098
...to Arizona with Alice and me.

238
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,540
Son, you're 24.

239
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:20,579
-You can't just live with us forever.
-l know. l mean--

240
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:24,879
Time to get out in the world a little.

241
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,193
<i>No one's home. Leave a message.</i>

242
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,995
Hey, Jonnie.

243
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:53,073
Sorry, man, l'm not used to these things.

244
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:58,516
l'm calling to tell you--
Well, to ask you, really....

245
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,380
You see, Ned and Alice
are moving to Arizona...

246
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:06,990
...and l'm just here.

247
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:13,431
To tell you the truth, man,
l'm not sure what to do.

248
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,530
lt seems like l've just been...

249
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:24,469
...baking...

250
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:26,477
...for so long.

251
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:28,815
<i>Bobby?</i>

252
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:20,865
-You're here.
-l can't believe it, man.

253
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,127
You're here.

254
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,398
-How was your trip?
-lt was a trip.

255
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:34,472
Your new home.
Welcome to the Tarantula Arms.

256
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:38,417
l know, it's a lot.

257
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,199
Hey, man, you got bootleg Dylan.

258
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:00,398
-ls he here?
-He's here.

259
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,971
Welcome, Bobby.

260
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:08,547
Bobby, Clare, about whom
you've heard so much.

261
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:11,947
-Hi.
-l am so glad to finally meet you.

262
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,645
Me too. You.

263
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,723
Thanks for letting me, you know,
crash here for a while.

264
00:31:18,993 --> 00:31:23,089
Well, come on. Grab your things,
get settled in. Come, Jonathan.

265
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:31,332
l like a little respite from all the décor.

266
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:35,240
You wanna go out to dinner,
or do you want to unpack first?

267
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,970
l mostly brought, you know...

268
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,636
...records.

269
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:42,446
-Let's go out.
-Okay.

270
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:46,212
-Have fun, boys.
-You come too.

271
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:47,752
Well, l--

272
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:50,857
No. You guys need
a little time alone, l think.

273
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,892
No, really. Come.

274
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,359
Okay.

275
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:59,724
l'll just put on my other eye,
and we're out of here.

276
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:20,115
-Bobby is adorable!
-He is, isn't he, in his Bobby way.

277
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:23,857
-Why are all the good ones gay?
-Bobby's not gay.

278
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:28,792
Well, it's hard to say exactly
what Bobby is. You want another beer?

279
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:30,453
Yeah.

280
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:38,597
Come on!

281
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,313
Tomorrow, l'm taking you up
to Central Park.

282
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:53,477
lnside a week, you'll have
the whole city figured out.

283
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,821
Hey, man.

284
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,291
-What?
-You got a tattoo.

285
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:03,954
Yeah, years ago, at NYU. l thought l could
be the kind of person who'd have a tattoo.

286
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:05,690
Cool.

287
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:08,792
Bobby.

288
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:14,003
l feel like there are things
we should talk about...

289
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,936
-...but l'm not sure what to say.
-What things?

290
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,545
You know, when we were kids...

291
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,818
...what we used to do.

292
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:29,086
Man, we were kids.

293
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:39,723
-So are you seeing anyone in Cleveland?
-No. l'm....

294
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:44,929
l was just, you know, working,
hanging out.

295
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:49,700
How about you?

296
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:52,846
-You seeing anybody?
-No.

297
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,375
No one in particular.

298
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,356
Hey, man.

299
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:11,828
Look what someone was throwing out.

300
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,296
Hey, Leonard C.

301
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:17,302
Right out there on the street,
along with dead spider plants and macramé.

302
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,736
How many times
did we get stoned to this?

303
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:21,807
l lost count.

304
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:25,572
Hey, man, l'm making lasagna.

305
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:30,684
We could knock off a bottle of Chianti
and listen to ''Suzanne,'' like, 1 0 times.

306
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:33,980
-Sorry, l've got a date.
-No problemo.

307
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,020
Save some for me.

308
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,991
You have to promise to make this,
at most, once a year.

309
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,792
Bobby, if l weigh 300 pounds,
l won't be able to get up the stairs.

310
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,458
Too bad Jonathan has to miss it.

311
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,064
Well, Jonathan has other priorities.

312
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,073
And it was the best.
We were out of our minds.

313
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:59,009
-You had a good time?
-The best. The best.

314
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,411
You know how sometimes
it seems like the DJ knows you?

315
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:06,652
That's what l'm talking about.

316
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,789
This is one of my sadness albums.

317
00:35:15,963 --> 00:35:17,897
-After my divorce.
-You were married?

318
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:22,900
Years ago.
He was a sadistic drug addict...

319
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:28,030
...and l was, well, a masochistic,
aspiring drug addict.

320
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:30,938
-lt made sense, at the time.
-Where'd you meet him?

321
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,509
-Want a real laugh? Woodstock.
-You were at Woodstock?

322
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:40,347
-Like, the concert?
-Well, l don't tell just anybody, Bobby.

323
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:42,484
-What was it like?
-Muddy.

324
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:45,524
You never seen so much mud.
l felt like a pig.

325
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:49,993
l was attracted to Denny because he had
a bar of Lifebuoy soap down at the pond.

326
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:55,795
-Hey, have you ever heard Steve Reich?
-No.

327
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,131
lt's one of my favorites. Listen.

328
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:01,207
l just sort of catch whatever happens
to blow through.

329
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:37,443
Hey, beauties.

330
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,137
Hello, dear. You're home early.

331
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:42,908
Yeah, l was having a little less
than maximum fun.

332
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:46,611
Well, as you know, we always leave
the porch light on for you.

333
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,482
Love that.

334
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,216
-Jonnie, have you heard this guy?
-Steve Reich.

335
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:55,556
-Sure.
-He's great. He's amazing. He's just--

336
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,357
He's....

337
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:03,565
-Where'd you find him anyway?
-He found me.

338
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,071
He's a welcome addition
to the household.

339
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,573
Bobby, you'll have to find a job,
aren't you?

340
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:12,406
l'm a baker. Think a New York bakery
would hire me?

341
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,708
ln New York, someone will pay you
to do just about anything.

342
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:17,578
lf l make a living making hats--

343
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:22,451
She doesn't exactly make a living making
hats. She picks up a little change that way.

344
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:26,457
That is not true. l do have some money
left over from my grandfather...

345
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:29,152
...but l've stashed it
for when the baby comes.

346
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,890
-You're having a baby?
-Didn't Jonathan tell you?

347
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,663
-lt hasn't come up.
-l didn't know you two were--

348
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,398
Lovers? We're not.
Most parents aren't lovers. Mine weren't.

349
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:44,066
l know this must sound a little....

350
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,779
A little what?
A little free? A little great?

351
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:52,079
A little like insisting on our own happiness
even if it's not what people ordinarily do?

352
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:53,481
Well....

353
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,989
Babies.

354
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,319
l mean, hey, let's have a dozen.

355
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,444
-Shit, you scared me.
-Sorry, man.

356
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,708
What are you doing?

357
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:29,117
l get up and walk around
in the dark sometimes.

358
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,316
-Does that weird you out?
-No.

359
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,490
l don't know.

360
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:38,723
When the place is all dark...

361
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:43,225
...when you and Clare have gone to sleep,
and l'm awake...

362
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:49,101
...it's like being alive and being dead
at the same time, you know?

363
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:52,639
lt's this sort of halfway thing...

364
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,407
...where the people who are alive
are dreaming...

365
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,552
...and the people who are dead...

366
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,888
...are where they are.

367
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,325
And l'm here...

368
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,520
...in the dark and the quiet.

369
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,297
You want some water?

370
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,269
Sure.

371
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:40,383
-Are you and Clare really having a baby?
-Oh, God.

372
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,263
l don't know.

373
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:45,892
We've been talking about it.

374
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,592
lt's something she really wants.

375
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:01,072
l like Clare.

376
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,416
So do l.

377
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:10,112
-Bye, Lacey.
-See you.

378
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:15,453
We can take it from there
if we need to.

379
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:18,564
-And on the Thursday ad, we can--
-Oh, shit. l gotta go.

380
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:20,495
-Can you--?
-Yeah, l got it.

381
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,501
-Thank you.
-Bye, Jonathan.

382
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,806

-Hey, is your name Dirk?
-No, l'm Jonathan.

388
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:04,444
l'm sorry, l just-- You look like
someone l know named Dirk. l'm Wes.

389
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:05,704
Hey, Wes.

390
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,443
-These are my friends Clare and Bobby.
-Pleasure, Wes.

391
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,281
So, Jonathan, Bobby and l'll see you later.

392
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:18,414
-l thought we were all having dinner.
-All right, l'll see you later.

393
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:24,293
Do you know what l think?

394
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:27,433
Now, can Clare be absolutely honest
with you?

395
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:30,162
l think you need a new haircut.

396
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:32,003
Really?

397
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:38,305
You're so handsome, and that hippie do
does absolutely nothing for you.

398
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:41,177
l don't know.

399
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:44,442
-l never really, you know, think about it.
-Well, l do.

400
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:46,279
See, here's the thing...

401
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:49,980
...you don't look like yourself this way.
You know what l'm saying?

402
00:41:50,157 --> 00:41:52,887
lf you look like someone
other than who you are...

403
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,120
...you could get the wrong job
and friends, who knows what.

404
00:41:56,297 --> 00:42:00,734
-You may end up with someone's whole life.
-l think this is my life.

405
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:04,337
-lt doesn't seem like somebody else's.
-Check.

406
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,448
What do you think?

407
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,358
-l look so--
-Dangerous? Sexy?

408
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,127
-Stripped down, ready for action?
-That's not what l was thinking, exactly.

409
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:39,500
Well, you are definitely gonna start
turning heads around here now.

410
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,331
Bobby...

411
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,801
-...what do you like about me?
-What?

412
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:48,210
Do you...?

413
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:54,947
-Do you like me?
-l like you. Of course l like you.

414
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:58,548
l mean, could you...?

415
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:00,751
You know, do you have...?

416
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,659
God, l can't believe
you're gonna make me say it.

417
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,131
Do you think l'm attractive?

418
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:14,206
l....

419
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:18,207
That's what l thought
you were gonna ask.

420
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:22,881
And, yes, l-- Absolutely, l do.

421
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,086
Good.

422
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,421
That's good.

423
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:41,134
Well, there's just no smooth
or sophisticated way to do this, is there?

424
00:43:49,243 --> 00:43:50,938
Clare.

425
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:52,738
No, listen.

426
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,942
You talk too much, darling.

427
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:57,675
lf you don't shut up,
l will come to my senses...

428
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:00,877
...and realize how stupid
and self-destructive this is.

429
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,080
l have to tell you, l've never...

430
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:04,881
...you know...

431
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,959
...done this before.

432
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:11,665
-Pardon me?
-l've never...

433
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,994
...you know....

434
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:16,735
-Never?
-No.

435
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,699
Does that freak you out?

436
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:22,001
No.

437
00:44:22,343 --> 00:44:26,507
l mean, yes, of course it freaks me out!
Jesus Christ.

438
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,883
l guess maybe we should stop.

439
00:44:32,286 --> 00:44:33,981
Maybe.

440
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,891
Because, you know...

441
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:41,954
...l may not be the most, like...

442
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:43,858
...adept.

443
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:47,925
Oh, honey.

444
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:52,036
You think l'm upset
because you might not be adept?

445
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:55,300
-ls that what you think?
-No.

446
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,008
l guess.

447
00:45:03,984 --> 00:45:06,817
Okay, junior...

448
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,984
...mama's gonna teach you
a thing or two.

449
00:45:12,693 --> 00:45:14,490
Are you nervous?

450
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:18,187
Don't be.

451
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:22,324
This is the most natural thing
in the world.

452
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,237
All right.

453
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:04,372
lt's all right.

454
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,255
Sorry l missed dinner.

455
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:25,521
Where is everybody?

456
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:12,670
Jonnie...

457
00:47:13,946 --> 00:47:15,777
...are you okay?

458
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:19,884
Are you okay?

459
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:21,747
l guess.

460
00:47:24,923 --> 00:47:28,586
-You should go back to Clare.
-No, man...

461
00:47:29,127 --> 00:47:31,357
...l don't wanna leave you alone.

462
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:43,002
You should go back to Clare.

463
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:45,266
Really.

464
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,775
Bobby?

465
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:18,068
Lovey, wakey, wakey!

466
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:22,077
l am not here. You never saw me.
l'm just the cleaning lady. So sorry.

467
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:25,876
You were in bed.
We tucked you in at 2 a.m.

468
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:27,382
l went out again.

469
00:48:27,552 --> 00:48:30,282
-Fun?
-Sort of.

470
00:48:30,455 --> 00:48:32,150
Potential?

471
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:33,757
l don't think so.

472
00:48:43,035 --> 00:48:45,367
So, what do we do now--?

473
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:47,232
-See you later, babies.
-Jonnie--

474
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:51,672
Oh, it's entirely fine. There's a whole world
full of art boys just outside.

475
00:48:51,843 --> 00:48:54,710
No worries. Love you.

476
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:26,473
Hey, man.
What are you doing up here?

477
00:49:26,645 --> 00:49:30,775
Some queen next door's got Mozart cranked.
l couldn't tear myself away.

478
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:32,177
Opera, huh?

479
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:42,885
Clare loves you.

480
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:45,424
l love Clare.

481
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:48,464
Doesn't this all seem sort of strange?

482
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:51,769
No, man, it's perfect.

483
00:49:51,937 --> 00:49:53,996
Just like this.

484
00:49:58,443 --> 00:50:01,378
Bobby, l'm starting to feel a little extra.

485
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:03,912
You're essential, man.

486
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:14,717
Let's dance.

487
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:20,662
-You can't dance to opera.
-You can dance to anything.

488
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:57,702
What are you doing?

489
00:50:58,203 --> 00:51:00,398
A little kiss between brothers.

490
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:03,707
Nothing wrong with that.

491
00:51:44,115 --> 00:51:45,742
Jon?

492
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:47,951
Jonnie?

493
00:51:52,624 --> 00:51:55,991
Clare! Clare, wake up!

494
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:58,895
What?

495
00:52:06,571 --> 00:52:08,198
Jonathan...

496
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:11,206
...you asshole! God.

497
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:13,469
We gotta find him.

498
00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:17,608
Honey, he isn't lost. He left.

499
00:52:20,118 --> 00:52:21,949
lt's my fault.

500
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,849
This is not true.

501
00:52:24,022 --> 00:52:27,549
No, you don't understand.

502
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,884
Bobby...

503
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:32,359
...this is a problem of Jonathan's.

504
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:36,689
-Trust me.
-There's something fucked up about me.

505
00:52:37,135 --> 00:52:40,002
There is nothing fucked up about you.

506
00:52:41,806 --> 00:52:43,706
You don't know.

507
00:52:45,644 --> 00:52:47,339
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Alice?

508
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,036
<i>Bobby, is</i> t<i>ha</i>t <i>you, honey?</i>

509
00:52:49,214 --> 00:52:52,240
l don't wanna worry you,
but have you heard from Jonathan?

510
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:55,045
Of course. He's here.
Do you wanna talk to him?

511
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:59,088
<i>He's</i> t<i>here? Grea</i>t<i>, pu</i>t <i>him on.</i>

512
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:04,322
Bobby, l'm sorry,
it looks like he's gone to bed already.

513
00:53:04,496 --> 00:53:08,330
-But l'll tell him you called, okay?
-<i>Tell him Clare and I are fine.</i>

514
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,264
Okay, sweetheart, l will.

515
00:53:11,436 --> 00:53:12,698
Bye-bye.

516
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:29,704
Do you like it here?

517
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:36,817
Here l can, more or less,
breathe the air...

518
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,321
...and your mother's learned
how to make blue margaritas.

519
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:48,156
Whoever expected to end up living
in the desert?

520
00:54:49,768 --> 00:54:53,329
Yeah, whoever expects
to end up living anywhere?

521
00:54:55,206 --> 00:54:58,937
That's too deep for me.

522
00:55:17,529 --> 00:55:19,053
How's that?

523
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,562
Looks a little bit like me, doesn't it?

524
00:55:21,733 --> 00:55:24,201
We're not speaking to anybody
right now.

525
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:28,233
<i>Happy holidays.</i>
<i>Celebra</i>t<i>e, all you people.</i>

526
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,633
<i>Hello, Bobby,</i> t<i>his is Alice.</i>

527
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:33,369
<i>Swee</i>t<i>hear</i>t<i>,</i> t<i>here's some</i>t<i>hing</i>
<i>I have</i> t<i>o</i> t<i>ell you.</i>

528
00:55:43,054 --> 00:55:45,318
Oh, look at you.

529
00:55:47,092 --> 00:55:48,719
And this is Clare.

530
00:55:49,194 --> 00:55:53,096
Oh, Clare. lt's so wonderful
to finally meet you.

531
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:56,631
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you for having me.

532
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:59,269
Alice, sorry.

533
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:07,776
Alice?

534
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:10,239
-So clumsy.
-l'll get it.

535
00:56:10,415 --> 00:56:14,613
lt's all right,
they cost a $ 1 .98 at Kmart.

536
00:56:23,995 --> 00:56:25,656
Alice.

537
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,891
Do something for me.

538
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:34,232
-Anything.
-Hold me.

539
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,437
Just hold me.

540
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:40,209
Okay.

541
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:45,510
Tighter.

542
00:56:47,919 --> 00:56:50,251
Don't be gentle with me.

543
00:56:51,456 --> 00:56:53,390
Squeeze me harder.

544
00:56:53,558 --> 00:56:54,820
Harder.

545
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,558
Make me feel like
you're breaking my ribs.

546
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,198
-Oh, God.
-l can't.

547
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:03,459
l don't wanna hurt you.

548
00:57:14,646 --> 00:57:16,705
l love you.

549
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:29,983
-You're an angel.
-Mom?

550
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:32,928
l'll be right there, honey.

551
00:57:43,942 --> 00:57:45,967
Anybody want a drink?

552
00:57:46,177 --> 00:57:48,873
-Okay, sure.
-Okay.

553
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:54,348
l'm sorry about--

554
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:57,420
Well, all this.

555
00:57:58,122 --> 00:58:01,387
l knew l'd see you both again.
l just imagined...

556
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,117
...well...

557
00:58:03,494 --> 00:58:04,961
...different circumstances.

558
00:58:06,197 --> 00:58:07,789
lt's okay.

559
00:58:07,966 --> 00:58:09,695
lt's okay.

560
00:58:14,172 --> 00:58:16,037
Ned, man...

561
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:18,141
...he was a trip.

562
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:22,142
He was like my father too.
You would have loved him, Clare.

563
00:58:22,313 --> 00:58:25,248
-l'm sure.
-Bobby?

564
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:29,648
lf you want my family so badly,
l hereby bequeath them to you.

565
00:58:29,821 --> 00:58:35,953
No. No, better yet, l hereby
bequeath you my whole entire life.

566
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:39,187
Be me. l hereby dub you
Jonathan Glover.

567
00:58:39,364 --> 00:58:42,128
Tomorrow, when they cremate
my father's body...

568
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,962
...you can be the son,
and l'll be the best friend.

569
00:58:45,136 --> 00:58:48,230
You can come back from the service
and console my mother.

570
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:49,873
Jonathan, stop it.

571
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:54,072
You're better at it than l am.
You're better qualified. So go at it...

572
00:58:54,245 --> 00:58:57,772
-...be their son with my blessings.
-Listen to me, you little shit.

573
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:01,612
All he's ever done is worship you.
All you've done is walk out on him.

574
00:59:01,786 --> 00:59:03,777
Don't you dare speak to him like that.

575
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:08,517
You don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know the first thing about worship.

576
00:59:09,027 --> 00:59:10,255
Do you know?

577
00:59:10,428 --> 00:59:13,363
Do you have any idea how much l--?

578
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:14,759
Listen, you guys--

579
00:59:14,932 --> 00:59:20,962
How much l wanted you?
How much l loved you, you asshole?

580
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:26,172
You know, and then, what an idiot l am.
How pathetic is that?

581
00:59:26,344 --> 00:59:28,778
Me, in love with you.
Then Bobby comes along...

582
00:59:28,946 --> 00:59:32,006
...and l fall in love with this one,
then l think that we--

583
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:34,811
That the three of us,
maybe we could--

584
00:59:35,553 --> 00:59:36,542
Fuck it.

585
00:59:36,821 --> 00:59:39,585
Just leave me alone and go back
to the house and have a drink.

586
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:40,985
Clare!

587
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:52,893
How could you just leave
without saying anything?!

588
00:59:53,071 --> 00:59:55,938
l couldn't be the uncle anymore.
Give me a break, okay?

589
00:59:56,107 --> 00:59:57,972
-Clare, hey.
-Don't call me that.

590
00:59:58,142 --> 01:00:00,235
What, don't call you what? Your name?

591
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:03,175
What did you think l would do
without you, Jonathan?

592
01:00:03,348 --> 01:00:06,545
-What were you thinking?
-Clare, come on.

593
01:00:06,718 --> 01:00:09,118
l'm pregnant, you fuckers!

594
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:14,348
What?

595
01:00:15,393 --> 01:00:17,384
Are you sure?

596
01:00:17,562 --> 01:00:19,860
l'm completely sure.

597
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:22,022
You wanted this, didn't you?

598
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,593
God help me.

599
01:00:26,337 --> 01:00:27,736
Clare.

600
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:31,238
-Oh, man.
-You think?

601
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,707
Yes.

602
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:42,043
Yes.

603
01:01:07,645 --> 01:01:10,512
What do you think about ''Ethan'' for a boy,
or ''Trevor''?

604
01:01:10,681 --> 01:01:13,809
-Let's not get fancy.
-lf it's a girl, call her ''Clare Jr.''

605
01:01:13,985 --> 01:01:15,714
One Clare per family is enough.

606
01:01:15,887 --> 01:01:19,653
-What will the kid call Bobby and me?
-l never thought of that. ''Daddy.''

607
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:21,587
Like ''Daddy One'' and ''Daddy Two''?

608
01:01:48,286 --> 01:01:50,754
-We're gonna have to move, aren't we?
-Right.

609
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:52,981
Funny family will need a third bedroom.

610
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:55,853
Funny family may need
a whole new neighborhood.

611
01:01:56,027 --> 01:01:59,758
Somewhere where two out of three people
passing by are not psychotic?

612
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:02,126
-Exactly.
-How about Cleveland?

613
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,892
-No!
-Let's move here.

614
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:08,164
-Please repeat what you just said.
-lt's too hard to raise a kid in the city.

615
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:10,068
Don't you think?

616
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:15,572
What if the kid turned out to be
some sort of, l don't know, Heidi.

617
01:02:15,746 --> 01:02:17,270
How much goodness do we want?

618
01:02:17,448 --> 01:02:20,417
Growing up in the country
doesn't doom anyone to good behavior.

619
01:02:20,585 --> 01:02:23,645
Most of the interesting murderers
come from derelict farms.

620
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:26,790
This is so adult, looking at real estate.

621
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:30,325
-We are adults, sort of.
-Who would the kid play with out here?

622
01:02:30,495 --> 01:02:32,360
Woodland creatures,
like Snow White.

623
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,227
l don't want him hanging with squirrels.
They have personality disorders.

624
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,389
Stop it!

625
01:02:38,236 --> 01:02:41,637
This one has a great soul,
don't you think?

626
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:43,433
Baby?

627
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:46,209
-lt's your money.
-lt's my grandfather's money.

628
01:02:46,377 --> 01:02:49,210
-l didn't earn a dime of it.
-Still.

629
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,280
You'd be the owner.

630
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:54,885
What do you think?

631
01:02:56,554 --> 01:02:59,318
You really want this, don't you?

632
01:03:00,391 --> 01:03:02,222
lf you do.

633
01:03:02,426 --> 01:03:04,291
lf we all do.

634
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:11,760
No, you, Bobby Morrow.
Beautiful, crazy boy.

635
01:03:11,936 --> 01:03:16,896
-You want this, and l could get it for you.
-No, it'd be for us.

636
01:03:30,154 --> 01:03:32,554
So long, treasures.

637
01:04:13,664 --> 01:04:17,293
l'm thinking white here.
Totally white, like a Shinto shrine...

638
01:04:17,468 --> 01:04:19,800
...and we can hang
paper lanterns all over.

639
01:04:19,971 --> 01:04:23,930
-You are the gayest human being ever.
-Somebody's gotta be gay around here.

640
01:04:24,108 --> 01:04:25,598
What do you like?

641
01:04:25,776 --> 01:04:30,008
l think l'm gonna go and fix a window.

642
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:33,116
Okay. Jonathan, blue is your friend.

643
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:35,809
See, blue is the color of sky and water.

644
01:04:35,987 --> 01:04:40,617
-Yeah, but white goes with everything.
-Well, honey, it's a house, not an outfit.

645
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:28,570
-lt's all right, l'll do it.
-No, sleep. lt's my night.

646
01:05:31,509 --> 01:05:34,637
lt's okay, Bobby's doing it.
lt's his night.

647
01:05:39,817 --> 01:05:43,514
lf we don't keep to the schedule,
we'll all be exhausted by tomorrow.

648
01:05:43,688 --> 01:05:47,818
-l don't care. l miss my daughter.
-Guess nobody's sleeping tonight.

649
01:05:47,992 --> 01:05:51,359
Hello, Rebecca. Hello.

650
01:05:54,598 --> 01:05:56,828
Oh, sweetie.

651
01:06:02,807 --> 01:06:05,298
-Hey, beauties and heroes.
-Where have you been?

652
01:06:05,476 --> 01:06:06,943
l got something to show you.

653
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:11,714
-This town's crying out for a cool café.
-This town's crying out for an outlet mall.

654
01:06:20,658 --> 01:06:23,559
What? lt has possibilities.

655
01:06:23,728 --> 01:06:25,992
Where? Point out a possibility.

656
01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:29,132
Kitchen's basically okay,
just needs a good cleaning.

657
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,564
Look, wood floors.

658
01:06:31,736 --> 01:06:34,227
-ls that a termite?
-No.

659
01:06:34,405 --> 01:06:36,339
Yeah, maybe.

660
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:38,837
l think l got a name.

661
01:06:39,977 --> 01:06:42,138
The Home Café.

662
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:44,247
What do you think?

663
01:06:45,149 --> 01:06:47,344
Well, it would be better for business...

664
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:51,284
...than ''The Squalor and Desperation Café,''
l suppose.

665
01:06:51,455 --> 01:06:55,789
And the goddess said, ''Feed the people
and send them out happy into the night.''

666
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,189
How's that mushroom lasagna
holding up?

667
01:07:01,365 --> 01:07:04,163
-Two more orders left.
-Save them for Martha and Gill.

668
01:07:04,335 --> 01:07:05,996
No problem.

669
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:10,401
-You got them, my dears.
-Thanks, Jonathan.

670
01:07:13,577 --> 01:07:17,172
We're home, dear.
Oh, she's not happy today.

671
01:07:17,348 --> 01:07:20,010
For a full hour. l have no idea.

672
01:07:20,317 --> 01:07:21,614
Hey, honey.

673
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:27,549
-Just feeling shitty?
-l think she's getting sick.

674
01:07:27,725 --> 01:07:30,626
l gotta get dressed
and get back to the restaurant.

675
01:07:30,795 --> 01:07:34,731
Yeah. And l have to, well,
pick up some toys.

676
01:07:37,401 --> 01:07:39,801
-You okay?
-Never better.

677
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,671
l seem to have ended up the mother
and the wife, haven't l?

678
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:50,472
-That's not fair.
-No, that's not fair.

679
01:07:50,648 --> 01:07:51,945
And l can't help that.

680
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,417
l thought you'd be out here.

681
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,393
l'm sorry.

682
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:08,822
You haven't done anything.

683
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:11,797
l just want everybody to be happy.

684
01:08:12,403 --> 01:08:15,998
-l know you do.
-lt won't always be like this. We're...

685
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:18,539
...still getting started.

686
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:24,613
Bobby, what if l...

687
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,818
...just couldn't do this?

688
01:08:28,519 --> 01:08:30,578
lt'll be okay. Trust me.

689
01:08:32,423 --> 01:08:35,221
You know, l think, maybe l'm not...

690
01:08:35,926 --> 01:08:37,791
...this unusual.

691
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:40,656
l think maybe it's just my hair.

692
01:08:43,801 --> 01:08:48,465
-l love your hair.
-Come here.

693
01:08:57,581 --> 01:09:00,812
-Oh, Bobby!
-Oh, <i>mamaci</i>t<i>a</i>!

694
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:02,776
Here you are.

695
01:09:04,321 --> 01:09:07,813
-Look what you've done!
-Our little place.

696
01:09:08,459 --> 01:09:10,393
lt's beautiful!

697
01:09:10,961 --> 01:09:15,421
Oh, that's Ned and me!
Where did you find this?

698
01:09:15,766 --> 01:09:18,997
Oh, it's lovely, all of it.

699
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:22,800
-l wanna see the kitchen.
-Come on.

700
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:36,382
Oh, l love it!

701
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:44,384
So here it is.
Yasgur's Farm, the holy ground itself.

702
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:49,559
lt's hard to believe all that went on here,
isn't it? lt just looks like....

703
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:52,235
Mud puddle and a field of cowpies?
l know.

704
01:09:52,403 --> 01:09:55,395
-Come on in, you people!
-No.

705
01:09:55,572 --> 01:09:59,838
l have been in that water before.
Bobby, don't you dare put her in there!

706
01:10:02,846 --> 01:10:05,713
Boys, give them a puddle to play in....

707
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:09,412
They're sweet together, aren't they?

708
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:14,216
-ln their gooney way.
-l think you're very brave.

709
01:10:17,394 --> 01:10:19,362
-You do?
-Yeah.

710
01:10:20,364 --> 01:10:23,424
When l was your age,
you got married and you had a family.

711
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,830
Never occurred to you
to do anything else.

712
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:29,799
Well, you know, l wanted that.
l wanted...

713
01:10:31,075 --> 01:10:33,839
...just a more normal thing
when l was younger.

714
01:10:34,011 --> 01:10:36,411
Just wanted a husband
and a baby and....

715
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:39,408
l think maybe you're better off.

716
01:10:40,317 --> 01:10:41,545
Really.

717
01:10:42,853 --> 01:10:46,152
One minute you have everything
you ever wanted, and the next...

718
01:10:46,323 --> 01:10:49,622
...you find yourself in some
suburban neighborhood somewhere.

719
01:10:50,794 --> 01:10:54,195
And it's fine. l mean,
it's not not fine, it's just....

720
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,195
The world just...

721
01:10:59,136 --> 01:11:01,798
...starts to shrink around you somehow.

722
01:11:08,912 --> 01:11:12,370
Most women have absolutely
no idea what they're getting into.

723
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,813
No.

724
01:11:15,285 --> 01:11:18,345
l don't suppose anyone knows
what they're getting into...

725
01:11:19,456 --> 01:11:21,014
...till they're into it.

726
01:11:33,303 --> 01:11:36,932
-For God's sake.
-Hey, what's up?

727
01:11:37,107 --> 01:11:39,200
A little privacy, please.

728
01:11:39,443 --> 01:11:41,809
You never wanted privacy before.

729
01:11:43,947 --> 01:11:45,209
You okay?

730
01:11:45,849 --> 01:11:47,373
Yeah, l'm fine.

731
01:11:50,187 --> 01:11:51,449
What's that?

732
01:11:52,356 --> 01:11:54,017
lt's nothing.

733
01:11:54,892 --> 01:11:56,223
Come here.

734
01:12:08,138 --> 01:12:11,801
lt's one of those spots, l think.

735
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:28,222
No, man, it's a bruise.

736
01:12:29,393 --> 01:12:30,792
Maybe.

737
01:12:32,096 --> 01:12:33,620
Absolutely.

738
01:12:33,897 --> 01:12:36,695
-Will you do something for me?
-Sure.

739
01:12:36,867 --> 01:12:38,801
-Don't tell them.
-l won't.

740
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:40,459
l can't....

741
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,272
-lf l'm sick--
-You're not sick.

742
01:12:45,843 --> 01:12:48,539
Just promise me that, then, okay?

743
01:12:48,712 --> 01:12:51,408
-lf it's just a bruise--
-lt is a bruise.

744
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:54,642
lf l just bumped my hip,
there's no reason to mention it.

745
01:12:54,818 --> 01:12:58,219
-lt is a bruise.
-Okay, there's no reason to talk about it.

746
01:12:58,388 --> 01:13:00,185
-Okay.
-All right.

747
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,829
-Mom, is that...?
-Your father's ashes.

748
01:13:47,204 --> 01:13:49,570
l thought there'd be a right moment.

749
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,334
Suddenly, if l don't give them
to you right now...

750
01:13:52,509 --> 01:13:55,376
...l'll have to take them back
to Phoenix with me.

751
01:13:55,546 --> 01:13:58,481
He wouldn't have wanted them
scattered in Arizona.

752
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:03,017
-l thought we could scatter them here.
-Here?

753
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,813
Well, this is your home, isn't it?

754
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:07,882
l guess.

755
01:14:08,559 --> 01:14:13,622
You know, l think it might be best just
to be done with it. He was a modest man.

756
01:14:13,797 --> 01:14:16,265
He wouldn't have wanted
an elaborate ceremony.

757
01:14:16,433 --> 01:14:18,628
-Mom.
-And l can tell you this...

758
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:21,600
...this is no more him than a pair
of his old shoes.

759
01:14:22,072 --> 01:14:27,169
Not yet. l'm--
Not here, not now. l'm not ready.

760
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:33,106
Well, whenever you are.

761
01:14:36,286 --> 01:14:38,777
-We should go.
-Okay.

762
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:54,597
-Oh, l love you, honey.
-l love you too.

763
01:15:01,044 --> 01:15:02,875
l'll see you at the café.

764
01:15:03,847 --> 01:15:05,610
Bye!

765
01:15:11,421 --> 01:15:17,257
l know. Did you get yourself dirty?
Did you? You got yourself so dirty.

766
01:15:17,427 --> 01:15:18,724
l need powder.

767
01:15:18,895 --> 01:15:22,353
Did you get yourself dirty?
l know you did.

768
01:15:22,532 --> 01:15:27,970
-You're so sexy like this.
-You are a true pervert. Get me the powder.

769
01:15:31,408 --> 01:15:34,741
What happened?
You got something on your face.

770
01:15:34,911 --> 01:15:36,776
Here, let me.

771
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:58,867
You can do anything, can't you?

772
01:15:59,036 --> 01:16:00,936
-Me? No.
-l mean it.

773
01:16:01,104 --> 01:16:04,699
You can live in the suburbs,
in the East Village, in the country.

774
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:07,309
lt doesn't make any difference to you,
does it?

775
01:16:07,477 --> 01:16:10,810
l don't know. l never really think about it.

776
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:14,781
There you go, all done. Come on.

777
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:17,381
Thanks.

778
01:16:17,554 --> 01:16:21,183
Come here. Sit up there, princess.

779
01:16:28,432 --> 01:16:32,334
You are a strange
and mysterious creature.

780
01:16:32,502 --> 01:16:35,403
l'm, like, the least mysterious one
around here.

781
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,873
l bet you could live in the Sahara.

782
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:42,000
l bet you'd just pitch a tent
and find someone to sell you a camel.

783
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:46,007
l mean it. ls there anything
you couldn't do?

784
01:16:51,154 --> 01:16:53,213
l couldn't be alone.

785
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,389
Nope.

786
01:16:59,996 --> 01:17:01,987
No, you couldn't, could you?

787
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:11,231
Hey, man.

788
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:16,796
Blessings on our day off.

789
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:24,180
l wonder if we should be closing
on Mondays.

790
01:18:24,381 --> 01:18:28,818
-l feel a little guilty about it.
-No worries, please.

791
01:18:32,989 --> 01:18:35,457
Hey, that little bruise gone away?

792
01:18:38,462 --> 01:18:39,895
Well, no.

793
01:18:41,431 --> 01:18:43,023
Let me see.

794
01:18:45,135 --> 01:18:48,332
-lt's the same.
-Let me see.

795
01:18:55,645 --> 01:18:58,808
See? lt's the same.

796
01:18:59,349 --> 01:19:02,113
No, man, it's fading.

797
01:19:05,956 --> 01:19:08,823
-You really think so?
-Absolutely.

798
01:19:29,513 --> 01:19:31,071
You wanna dance?

799
01:19:32,315 --> 01:19:35,250
-What?
-Come on.

800
01:21:20,423 --> 01:21:21,822
Jonathan.

801
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:36,000
Hi.

802
01:21:41,478 --> 01:21:44,379
l was so in love with you.

803
01:21:47,117 --> 01:21:49,210
l was in love with you too.

804
01:21:55,191 --> 01:21:57,785
But Bobby is the love of your life.

805
01:22:01,064 --> 01:22:03,430
You know it's not that simple.

806
01:22:06,169 --> 01:22:07,830
lt's just that...

807
01:22:10,807 --> 01:22:13,173
...l seem to have ended up....

808
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:21,575
-Come to bed.
-l can't sleep.

809
01:22:22,285 --> 01:22:24,185
Do you want me to get up?

810
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:27,990
No.

811
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:30,454
Go back to sleep.

812
01:22:31,394 --> 01:22:33,794
Good night, crazy mama.

813
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,198
lt'll all seem better in the morning.

814
01:22:51,981 --> 01:22:55,781
-Gonna miss you.
-lt's just a few days.

815
01:22:57,921 --> 01:23:02,017
-You're taking a lot of stuff.
-Well, she needs a lot of stuff.

816
01:23:04,594 --> 01:23:06,824
Okay, l think we're all set.

817
01:23:15,405 --> 01:23:16,633
So....

818
01:23:18,742 --> 01:23:21,677
Bobby, do you wanna come with us?

819
01:23:22,045 --> 01:23:23,842
l can't.

820
01:23:27,584 --> 01:23:28,812
Bobby.

821
01:23:30,854 --> 01:23:33,186
Do you wanna come with us?

822
01:23:43,566 --> 01:23:45,124
No.

823
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:52,197
Okay.

824
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:55,439
Okay.

825
01:23:57,247 --> 01:23:59,715
-Call me.
-l will.

826
01:23:59,883 --> 01:24:02,010
-Okay?
-Yeah.

827
01:24:12,796 --> 01:24:15,663
You're a brave woman,
visiting your mother all alone.

828
01:24:15,832 --> 01:24:18,426
She's not alone.
She's got Rebecca with her.

829
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:20,193
Now...

830
01:24:21,604 --> 01:24:23,834
...don't worry, Miss R.

831
01:24:26,109 --> 01:24:29,340
The best thing about Philadelphia
is you can leave it...

832
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,080
...and we'll be waiting for you right here
when you come home.

833
01:24:33,249 --> 01:24:35,114
lf you're lucky and good...

834
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:39,847
...we'll have a special surprise waiting
for you when you get back.

835
01:24:43,493 --> 01:24:45,791
Lovey. Lovey.

836
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:54,433
Boys.

837
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,371
Be good.

838
01:24:59,943 --> 01:25:01,843
Always.

839
01:25:02,745 --> 01:25:04,474
Love you.

840
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,783
You sleeping, man?

841
01:25:47,257 --> 01:25:49,020
l can't, really.

842
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:01,833
They're not coming back, you know.

843
01:26:40,209 --> 01:26:43,906
-This is a good spot, don't you think?
-Yeah, l do.

844
01:26:45,715 --> 01:26:48,411
You think we should, like,
say a few words?

845
01:26:52,021 --> 01:26:54,012
We got this far, Dad.

846
01:26:54,857 --> 01:26:57,417
l think you'd like it. l really do.

847
01:26:58,895 --> 01:27:01,489
-Hey, man.
-l should've written something.

848
01:27:01,664 --> 01:27:03,859
No, man. This is perfect.

849
01:27:06,169 --> 01:27:09,605
Anyway, Dad, here we are.

850
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,601
lt's our place.

851
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:15,005
And it's yours too.

852
01:27:17,914 --> 01:27:19,882
Okay.

853
01:27:21,818 --> 01:27:23,149
Now.

854
01:27:29,993 --> 01:27:31,585
One.

855
01:27:32,729 --> 01:27:33,957
Two.

856
01:27:34,864 --> 01:27:36,161
Three.

857
01:27:38,868 --> 01:27:41,735
-<i>Wha</i>t<i>'s</i> t<i>ha</i>t<i>?</i>
-<i>Window pane.</i>

858
01:27:42,338 --> 01:27:45,307
-For clarity of vision.
-lf something bad happens...

859
01:27:45,475 --> 01:27:48,842
...tell my parents l tried to be good,
but it was just too hard.

860
01:27:49,912 --> 01:27:53,279
You're not freaked out about
the graveyard? l mean, don't be.

861
01:27:53,449 --> 01:27:55,417
The dead are just people too.

862
01:27:57,086 --> 01:27:59,247
People who wanted the same things
we want.

863
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:02,152
What do we want?

864
01:28:03,326 --> 01:28:05,191
l don't know, man.

865
01:28:06,396 --> 01:28:08,694
l mean, our lives, right?

866
01:28:08,998 --> 01:28:12,161
Man, like, this whole big,
beautiful, noisy world...

867
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,600
...and everything that can happen.

868
01:28:21,044 --> 01:28:22,773
All's well, little brother.

869
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:25,814
Your folks love you.

870
01:28:26,416 --> 01:28:27,644
l love you.

871
01:28:31,521 --> 01:28:33,284
Nothing to fear.

872
01:29:00,016 --> 01:29:03,452
l've been thinking,
we should repaint Rebecca's room.

873
01:29:03,619 --> 01:29:05,484
-Like, pink.
-She'd like that.

874
01:29:05,655 --> 01:29:07,714
-Don't you think?
-Okay.

875
01:29:09,392 --> 01:29:11,189
She'll come back someday...

876
01:29:12,595 --> 01:29:14,392
...to this house, l mean.

877
01:29:16,599 --> 01:29:18,191
lt'll be hers.

878
01:29:20,803 --> 01:29:22,361
l guess it will be.

879
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:24,797
She probably won't want it, right?

880
01:29:26,109 --> 01:29:28,873
She probably won't have any idea
what to do with it.

881
01:29:29,278 --> 01:29:32,008
But still, it'll be hers, you know?

882
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:34,982
lt'll be hers.

883
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,187
Listen.

884
01:29:42,692 --> 01:29:46,184
This will be an all right place
to put my ashes too, okay?

885
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:51,730
Sure.

886
01:29:53,569 --> 01:29:57,437
l mean, whatever you want.

887
01:29:59,308 --> 01:30:01,572
You built us a very good home.

888
01:30:01,844 --> 01:30:03,368
That's not what--

889
01:30:05,281 --> 01:30:07,010
That's what you did.

890
01:30:08,851 --> 01:30:12,412
That's what you did for me, you know?

891
01:30:17,426 --> 01:30:19,792
lt's funny, isn't it?

892
01:30:20,563 --> 01:30:21,791
What?

893
01:30:23,799 --> 01:30:26,393
The big, beautiful, noisy world.

894
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,595
Everything that can happen.

895
01:30:33,109 --> 01:30:34,440
Yeah.

896
01:30:35,578 --> 01:30:37,478
lt's funny.
