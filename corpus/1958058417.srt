1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:03,370
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,540
(mysterious music)

3
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,810
- [Marilyn] Joe, stop, Wayne is bound to wake up soon.

4
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,044
- [Joe] He's out like a light.

5
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,614
I put two capsules in his hot chocolate.

6
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,016
- Two, aren't those pills dangerous?

7
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,918
- They're just sleeping pills.

8
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,087
- [Marilyn] But you can overdose on them.

9
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,122
- [Joe] I take two when I wanna sleep the night through.

10
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,223
They never hurt me any.

11
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,760
- [Marilyn] But Wayne's only 14.

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,595
- Come on, Marilyn, it's Christmas.

13
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,931
I can't think of any better way to celebrate.

14
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,501
- [Marilyn] Okay, Santa.

15
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,470
- [Joe] Bet you never made it with Santa before.

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,373
(mysterious music)

17
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,336
- (gasps) Wayne, put that down!

18
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,871
- Calm down, son!

19
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,907
I love your mother as, as much as your father did!

20
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,375
- You can never compare to my father.

21
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,110
- I'm as sorry as you are that he's dead!

22
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,081
- I deserve a chance to be happy, Wayne, and so do you.

23
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,115
- [Joe] No!

24
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,317
(gun firing) (Joe grunts)

25
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:02,222
(gun firing) (Marilyn screaming)

26
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,492
(mysterious music)

27
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,598
(suspenseful music)

28
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,080
- A rinky dink .22?

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,016
People insist on keeping these things in their homes.

30
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,886
So she keeps it in the drawer loaded, right?

31
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,489
Kid gets hold of it, pow, pow, pow.

32
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,557
Merry Christmas, Mommy.

33
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,559
Merry Christmas, Uncle Joe.

34
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,561
- That was the kid's uncle?

35
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,062
- His father died three years ago,

36
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:46,566
and apparently the boy, Wayne, never got over it.

37
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,702
Hates anybody taking Daddy's place with Mommy.

38
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,539
- Oedipus complex.

39
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,741
- That's what the shrinks will say, suckers.

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,844
You know, like sticking a label on it

41
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,547
gives him an excuse for his piss-poor behavior.

42
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,815
So he'll do some time in juvenile detention.

43
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,184
They'll have to let him go when he's 18,

44
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,654
He'll be back blowing people away.

45
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,556
- [Cop] Same old story.

46
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,125

- [Cameraman] Right to the camera.

73
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,303
Right to the camera.

74
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,437
I love it.

75
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,307
(lively music)

76
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,541
I love it.

77
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,876
Looking good.

78
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,044
Bring the reflector in.

79
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,980
The camera's your lover.

80
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,616
That's great, Laura, that's great.

81
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,118
- [Reporter] Would you mind holding this right here.

82
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,520
- Oh, no, no, not at all, here, how's that, sure.

83
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,288
- Thank you.

84
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,725
This is Diane Heller, Channel 9 Showbiz News,

85
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,360
and I'm talking with Bruce Brunswick,

86
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,895
publisher of Girly Magazines,

87
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,999
and producer of what is commonly called T and A videos.

88
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,234
Not politically correct,

89
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,569
and entirely too risky for us to show you

90
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,305
any of the newest video being shot here today

91
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,942
under the unlikely title, "Scream Queen Christmas".

92
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,912
- Well, whether you realize it or not, Diane,

93
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,748
there's a huge market for the stuff we do.

94
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,018
And it's all good, harmless fun.

95
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,421
"Scream Queens Illustrated" is kinda like um,

96
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,224
Playboy come to the horror genre.

97
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,993
From the magazine then we branched out

98
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,495
into videos, and films, so forth.

99
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,099
- So you're getting rich off of this, this crap.

100
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,967
I mean that's what some people call it.

101
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,436
- (chuckles) Well, not exactly.

102
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,671
- Not exactly getting rich?

103
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,072
- Not exactly crap.

104
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,175
- Oh, what do you call it then?

105
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,311
- It's a tasteful presentation of horror movies,

106
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,714
horror movie makers, and horror movie starlets.

107
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,850
The girls have beautiful bodies,

108
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,353
and normal, healthy guys enjoying looking at them.

109
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,223
We're helping them launch and sustain their careers,

110
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,424
and they know it.

111
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,993
They're not just a bunch of brainless bimbos.

112
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:41,894
I'll prove it to you.

113
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,262
Raven, come here, honey.

114
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,199
- Hi.

115
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,634
- Diane Heller, meet Raven Quinn.

116
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,336
- Hi, how are you (giggles)?

117
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,505
- Raven's the star of our little production,

118
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,739
"Scream Queen Christmas".

119
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,974
- [Raven] Mm hmm.

120
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,843
- Ah, incidentally, the term Scream Queen

121
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,511
was originally coined for Raven.

122
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,279
Tell the folks out in TV land

123
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,482
what your college degree is in, honey.

124
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,083
- I have a masters in zoology.

125
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,919
- You're a zoologist?

126
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,423
- Yes, well, my husband, Eric, he's a glamor photographer.

127
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,859
- Shoots a lot of our nude portfolios.

128
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,627
- Right, well, he talked me into posing

129
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,662
before we were married (giggles).

130
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,466
And then um, I just had such a huge fan following,

131
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,269
the movie offers started flowing in and here I am.

132
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,806
- [Bruce] And she can act, not just look good.

133
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,242
- By showing as much skin as possible?

134
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:33,246
- Hey, look, a lot of people like looking at skin.

135
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,447
- That's right.

136
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,449
- Especially if it's wrapped around

137
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,917
the right kind of package.

I'm your, I'm your biggest fan?

150
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,820

151
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,396
Merry Christmas, Raven.

(suspenseful music)

153
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,896
- [Raven] Hi, Laura.

154
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:04,897
- Hi, Raven.

155
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,334
What's your scene you're shooting today.

156
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,269
- I'm actually not shooting a scene today.

157
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,438
I just came in to sign a contract.

158
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:19,078
- You don't seem like yourself today at all.

159
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,180
- I know, I just had a fight with Eric.

160
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,051
He left on Saturday for photo shoot in Akron.

161
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,887
Says he's not gonna come home.

162
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,523
He's gonna file for a divorce.

163
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,026
- Ouch, sorry to hear that.

164
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,629
Do your kids know?

165
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,632
- No, I haven't figured out a way

166
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,100
to tell them yet, you know?

167
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,003
Guess I'm kinda hoping I won't have to.

168
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,005
- [Man] Laura Britton, wanted on the set.

169
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,307
- Great Christmas present, huh?

170
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,542
- [Man] Laura Britton, you're on.

171
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,776
Camera's ready to roll.

172
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,511
- Well, I gotta get back on the set.

173
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,880
(suspenseful music)

174
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,881
- Good luck.

175
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,851
(suspenseful music)

176
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,388
(Raven sighs)

177
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,391
(suspenseful music)

178
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,963
I'm so pleased to have such a strong

179
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,466
supportive fan like you, Wayne.

180
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,073
I had no idea that you had so many

181
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,745
souvenirs of me and my movies.

182
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,718
- I just loved you in your last movie, "The Hooded Claw".

183
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,455
I, I even got some props from the movie.

184
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,458
(suspenseful music)

185
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,362
Nobody loves you as much as I do, Raven.

186
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,965
- I believe you, Wayne, I do.

187
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,469
I believe you.

188
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,239
(suspenseful music)

189
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,074
Wayne, I'm so pleased.

190
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,346
(lips smack) (exhales deeply)

191
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,615
I'm so pleased, Wayne.

192
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,618
(suspenseful music)

193
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,702
(knocking on door)

194
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,804
- [Savanah] Mommy!

195
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,005
- [Angela] Mommy!

196
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:33,806
- [Mom] Come on in, close the door.

197
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,740
It's cold outside.

198
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,075
- What're you kids doing?

199
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,309
- You wanna come in for some coffee

200
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,811
while they get their hats and coats on?

201
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,979
- No, thanks, we gotta get going.

202
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,813
Get your coats ready.

203
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,081
Say goodbye to Grandma.

204
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,016
- Eric phoned from Akron awhile ago.

205
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,651
He wasn't too happy that you weren't

206
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,453
watching Savannah and Angela herself.

207
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,154
Not that we mind, but (scoffs).

208
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,322
- What's wrong, he doesn't trust them

209
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,757
with his own mother and sister?

210
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,492
- Well, sure he trusts us.

211
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,228
He just doesn't think that we oughta be doing your job.

212
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,931
He makes no bones about it, Raven, and we agree.

213
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,899
Now that you're the mother of two darling children,

214
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,103
you really oughta look for a more dignified line of work.

215
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,106
- Well, it's the same line of work that he's in.

216
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,108
Besides he's the one who got me into it in the first place.

217
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,110
- Yes, but he's on the other end of the camera.

218
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,978
He doesn't go around showing himself.

219
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,147
The kids aren't gonna open some sleazy magazine,

220
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,882
and find him in there stark naked.

221
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,617
- Why don't you kids play outside, okay?

222
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,252
- I'll be there one minute.

223
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,088
Do you got your dolls?

224
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,491
I'll be right out, okay, honey?

225
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:28,727
You said he called.

226
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,962
Did he leave a number?

227
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,563
- Oh, you must really be on the outs,

228
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,198
if you don't even know where he's staying.

229
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,234
- Did he leave a number or not?

230
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,168
- It's by the phone.

231
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,403
He's staying at the same motel

232
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,971
where he's doing that fantasy girl shoot.

233
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,974
(suspenseful music)

234
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,312
You oughta know better than to bother him when he's working.

235
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,181
- Now he said he can't take any calls till after six.

236
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,450
(suspenseful music)

237
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,585
- Hi extension 1602, please.

238
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,055
(suspenseful music)

239
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,490
Eric, hi, honey.

240
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,959
I hope I'm not bothering you.

241
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,394
Hello?

242
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,266
Must've been disconnected.

243
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,534
- (laughing) I don't think so, dear.

244
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,002
He must have hung up.

245
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,171
- He really hates being interrupted while he's working.

246
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,506
He told us not to even give you the phone number.

247
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,075
We know there's something wrong between you two,

248
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,110
so don't even try to pretend otherwise.

249
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,645
- All couples argue,

250
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,648
and there's nothing wrong between us that can't be fixed,

251
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,683
especially if his loving mother,

252
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,253
and adoring sister would learn to butt out!

253
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,290
- [Mrs. Quinn] Bad news.

254
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,026
- Kids!

255
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,329
(girls laughing and chattering)

256
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,431
Savanah, Angela, come on.

257
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,299
Let's go, girls.

258
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,868
Here, take Fluffy, come on!

259
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,204
- [Savanah] You and Grandma weren't fighting.

260
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,206
- Hey, we weren't fighting, okay?

261
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,107
Everything's all right.

262
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,608
Now, come on.

263
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,844
We're gonna go and put some Christmas decorations up,

264
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,945
and get ready for Santa Claus, all right?

265
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:53,979
(girls cheering)

266
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,114
- [Angela] Santa.

267
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,648
- Get in the car, buckle up.

268
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,052
Good girls.

269
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,054
You in there?

270
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,288
(suspenseful music)

271
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,492
- There, that should take care of that.

272
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,597
Alright, are you ready to get started?

273
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,965
Okay.

274
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,635
(suspenseful music)

275
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,203
(Eric gasps)

276
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,638
- Eric, what's the matter?

277
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,907
I thought we were really getting some good stuff here.

278
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,576
- Yeah, yeah, we were, but ah--

279
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,278
- Who was that on the phone?

280
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:31,016
- It was, ah, nobody, no, it was my wife.

281
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,351
Soon to be my ex-wife.

282
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,855
- Maybe she just doesn't appreciate you.

283
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:42,561
- Yeah, well, maybe, but ah, nevermind that now.

284
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,196
Let's get into what we're doing, okay?

285
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,130
- Okay.

286
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,732
- Come on, we can get it back.

287
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,767
Now, show me what you got.

288
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,601
Come on, Debbie.

289
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,304
That's it, baby, come on.

290
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,040
Beautiful, give me those eyes.

291
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,508
Give me those big brown eyes.

292
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,644
Oh yeah, sweetheart.

293
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,846
That's, oh yeah.

294
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,181
Like a goddess.

295
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,185
Come on, make love to the camera, sweetheart.

296
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,219
Oh, you're beautiful.

297
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,022
Damn, you're heating me up now.

298
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,124
That's it.

299
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,494
Come on, baby, let loose now.

300
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,062
Don't hold back on me, girl.

301
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,166
Hey.

302
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,069
(mysterious music)

303
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,146
Yeah.

304
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:34,980
Yeah, oh.

305
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,885
(mysterious music)

306
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,044
(suspenseful music)

307
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,923
- [Wayne] Hey, look what I got!

308
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,291
- Wayne, we were at Grandmas!

309
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,094
- Oh boy, we don't have those for Christmas!

310
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,529
- Mommy, may we?

311
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,497
- Wayne, you're gonna spoil them.

312
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,366
- (chuckles) I know, I shouldn't have.

313
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,869
It's just a little inexpensive, early gift.

314
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,137
- Yeah, I should say it's early.

315
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,207
It's only one day until the Christmas vacation.

316
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,610
- Then it's one day until their Christmas vacation present.

317
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,845
All right, Raven?

318
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,147
- [Girls] All right, Mommy, all right?

319
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,348
- [Raven] All right, all right.

320
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,284
- [Girls] Yay, thank you, thank you!

321
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,451
- Wait a second, girls!

322
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,953
Don't you need these to get in.

323
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,722
So just hold your horses or your reindeer or whatever!

324
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,723
Wayne, do you wanna come in?

325
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,025
We're having some leftovers,

326
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,761
and you can help us decorate the tree later.

327
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,829
- [Wayne] I, I'd love to.

328
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,331
- I really need to relax.

329
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,833
I just had a huge fight with Eric's mother and sister.

330
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,170
- Hey, are you on Venus or what?

331
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,471
- (chuckles) I'm right here.

332
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,673
- [Debbie] Mm.

333
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,608
- What would you think if I told you ah,

334
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,642
you're the first one?

335
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,646
- (giggles) Come on, I'm not gonna believe that.

336
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,016
You're a virgin, married with two children?

337
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,119
- No, I mean other than my wife.

338
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,288
You're the first one since I've been married.

339
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,658
- Yeah, I'm not gonna believe that either.

340
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,559
- Well, it's true.

341
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,196
Listen, I've been in this business for 10 years,

342
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:35,400
and I've never, ever slept with the talent.

343
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,769
I've always wanted to stay married.

344
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,172
- What makes you think your wife was so faithful?

345
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,243
- (scoffs) Yeah, maybe you're right.

346
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,712
- No maybes about it.

347
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,814
You were a true blue sap.

348
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,949
- Yeah, you're probably right.

349
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,819
- You can take that to the bank.

350
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,724
(lips smacking)

351
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,497
(Eric and Debbie grunt)

352
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,066
I'm gonna do you a big favor, Eric.

353
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,435
I'm gonna make you forget about your wife,

354
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,038
about your kids, and about your job.

355
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,643
And the only thing on your mind from now on is gonna be me.

356
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,712
♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly

357
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,016

- Very good, now let's--

365
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,031
- One more carol, Mom?

366
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,865
- No.

367
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,699
- Please, Mommy?

368
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,733
- No, that was one more.

369
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,802
Now, you promised.

370
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,405
Kiss Wayne, give him a big hug and go to bed.

- [Angela] Goodnight.

373
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,808
- Goodnight.

374
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,709
- Be a good girl.

375
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,110
- (grunts) Goodnight.

376
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,944
- [Raven] Goodnight, honey.

377
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,146
- [Savanah] Goodnight.

378
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,715
- See you in the morning, don't fight.

379
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,618
(mysterious music)

380
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,790
I guess after with the fight I had with my in-laws today,

381
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,092
they're not gonna wanna watch my kids anymore.

382
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,561
I'll have to put them in daycare.

383
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,229
- I'm sure they'd still wanna watch

384
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,765
Angela and Savanah, wouldn't they?

385
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,933
- Well, I don't know.

386
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,436
I mean, they really don't like me.

387
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,937
They were very much against Eric

388
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,872
marrying me in the first place.

389
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,107
They consider my movies

390
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,609
about a half a step above porno films.

391
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,811
- What about him?

392
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,779
Don't they realize that he makes a living

393
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,314
photographing not only you,

394
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,817
but lots of other beautiful women in the nude.

395
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,085
- Yeah, I know,

396
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,687
but you see, that's okay if he does it,

397
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,857
but it's not okay if he marries one of these types of girls.

398
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,625
See, I think they love the idea

399
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,394
that we may be getting divorced.

400
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,730
I just have to be careful

401
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,131
they don't turn my own kids against me.

402
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,369
- You know, now that school is out for the holidays,

403
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,472
I have two weeks vacation from my teacher's aid job.

404
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,708
I'd be more than willing to babysit for you,

405
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,510
if you need me to.

406
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,112
- Aren't you sick of being around kids, Wayne?

407
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,580
I mean, it's a nice offer, but--

408
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,615
- I, I like your children.

409
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,683
There'd be no trouble at all.

410
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,884
They're not like the rowdies

411
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,586
I have to deal with down at school.

412
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,957
- Well, you know I do have a dinner appointment

413
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,658
with my producer tomorrow night.

414
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,460
If you wanna give it a shot, you can.

415
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,729
- Sure, sure, I'd love to.

416
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,399
You know, what is this

417
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,667
"Scream Queen Christmas" you're doing?

418
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,771
What's it all about?

419
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,840
- Well, it's, it's a 60 minute video.

420
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,842
It's not a feature film.

421
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,246
And it's basically an excuse for a bunch of horny guys

422
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,381
to watch a bunch of naked women (laughing).

423
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,153
It has about zero plots.

424
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,622
It's about this magical snowman,

425
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,425
and he casts a spell on this group of guys,

426
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,527
and they all wake up in the morning on Christmas,

427
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,263
and they have the girl of their dreams under the tree.

428
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,898
So I play one of the girls.

429
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,400
I pop out of this Christmas package,

430
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,069
and I'm in this sexy little outfit.

431
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,205
- And then you--

432
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,641
- Get naked, of course.

433
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,810
That's what they wanna see.

434
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,812
- Doesn't that, doesn't that bother you?

435
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,581
- No, why should it?

436
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,819
- I mean, thinking of what all those guys are doing

437
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,654
while they're watching you.

438
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,556
- Well, I don't think about that.

439
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,424
It's a lot of fun for me,

440
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,826
and I make a lot of money at it.

441
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,794
- How about the guys on the set?

442
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,930
Don't they get turned on watching you?

443
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,166
Like, like, like that producer friend of yours

444
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,768
that you're going out with tonight.

445
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,637
- Wayne, you know you're starting to sound like my husband,

446
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,873
and I don't appreciate it.

447
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,842
Let's just drop the subject, okay?

448
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,546
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

449
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,281
I guess I was being a little nosy.

450
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,183
Sometimes I can't help it.

451
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,887
You're my friend and I worry about you.

452
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,556
- I don't know.

453
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,360
I just (sighs), I guess I just got used to it

454
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,729
more and more as time went on, you know?

455
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,631
Just got used to the business.

456
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,104
I enjoy being called a Scream Queen now, you know?

457
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,874
I never would've dreamt I'd be doing this for a living.

458
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,408
- Do you ever miss your old career?

459
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,344
I mean, do you ever think you'll go back to zoology?

460
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,578
- I don't know.

461
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,247
You know, I must have the weirdest resume

462
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,781
in the whole world.

463
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,819
Raven Quinn, zoologist, actress,

464
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,222
Scream Queen, wife, and mother.

465
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,457
- [Wayne] Hmm.

466
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,225
- And my husband thinks I'm failing miserably

467
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,260
at the last two.

468
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,730
- I think you're a wonderful mother, Raven.

469
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,633
I'd love to have you as my wife and raise my children.

470
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:39,638
- You know I'm actually very strange, don't you?

471
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,106
I have a very dark side.

472
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,876
You know when we were about 10 years old,

473
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,645
all the other girls were playing hopscotch,

474
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,246
and jump rope, and all this stuff,

475
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,814
and I was out looking for road kill

476
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,250
for dead rabbits, and possums,

477
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,121
and (laughs) anything that I could like take home,

478
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,190
and, and, and rip open, and figure out, you know?

479
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,659
Well, I think it was very natural,

480
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,294
because as a little girl,

481
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,763
I just wanted to find out what makes

482
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:08,099
living things live, you know?

483
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:12,537
Even if it meant that I had to open up dead ones.

484
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,406
Do you think that's weird, Wayne?

485
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,642
- No, no, do you think I'm weird?

486
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,112
- Yeah, really weird (laughs).

487
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,116
I'm just kidding.

488
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,651
Come on, what's wrong with you?

489
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,322
I'm just, Wayne, Wayne, come back to me.

490
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,757
I was just kidding.

491
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,892
I'm just kidding.

492
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,796
(suspenseful music)

493
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,001
- How, how come you're home early today?

494
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,936
Are they finished with filming the movie,

495
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,805
"Scream Queen Christmas"?

496
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,207
- Well, actually they're,

497
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,242
I think they're shooting with ah, Laura tonight.

498
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,978
- Laura who?

499
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,312
- Laura Britton.

500
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:59,217
- You and her did that, that "Hooded Claw" thing together.

501
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,151
- [Raven] Mm hmm.

502
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:00,952
- She got clawed to death.

503
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,187
- Mm hmm, that's right.

504
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,788
You know when I wasn't acting in the that film,

505
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,224
I helped him with the special effects.

506
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,293
We put so much blood on Laura,

507
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,195
she stuck to the floor (laughing).

508
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,098
Blood is really sticky.

509
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:13,965
- Really?

510
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,799
- Yeah.

511
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,734
- It's that sticky?

512
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,968
- Yeah, I mean all it is,

513
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,137
it's, it's corn syrup with red food coloring.

514
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,639
That's all it is.

515
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,475
- You know, you know, I, I heard

516
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,710
real blood's really sticky too.

517
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,614
- Really, I wouldn't know.

518
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,083
First, I, I get rid of your husband, and then we,

519
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,053
then you say you wanna go with that sleazeball producer,

520
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,423
that Bruce Brunswick character?

521
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,827
Don't you realize all he wants is to get in your pants?

522
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,831
Oh, oh sure, I'll babysit your kids while he lays you!

523
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,168
What kind of fool do you take me for, Raven?

524
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,337
(mysterious music)

525
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,740
Don't try and treat me like you treat your husband.

526
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,475
I won't stand for it!

527
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,647
Nobody loves you as much as I do, Raven.

528
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,583
(mysterious music)

529
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,988
If you reject my true and honest love,

530
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,493
then you'll get what's coming to you.

531
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,396
(mysterious music)

532
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,770
Do you hear me?

533
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,473
Do you hear me?

534
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,242
Huh, do you hear me?

535
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:36,014
Do you hear me (screaming)?

536
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,589
All right, Raven.

537
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,927

538
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:10,281
♪ When I first saw her at the midnight movie show ♪

539
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,553
♪ A haunting beauty out of Edgar Allan Poe ♪

540
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,992

00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,561

♪ She makes me shout out loud

543
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,736
- [Cameraman] Hey, rub the little bear.

544
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,840
Yes, cozy up with the bear, good.

545
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,048
Put the bear to bed.

546
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,853
All right, that's a cut.

547
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,558
- [Bruce] Wow, what a scene.

548
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,960
- That's the best handheld stuff I've ever done.

549
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,129
- Oh boy.

550
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,063
- You want me to do it one more time?

551
00:29:59,063 --> 00:29:59,998
- What do you think, Bruce?

552
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,566
- Oh, ho, ho, it worked for me.

553
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,767
- That's a wrap then.

554
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,770
(suspenseful music)

555
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,888
- [Don] See ya, Bruce.

556
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,924
- Oh, goodnight, Don, good weekend, huh?

557
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:26,958
- [Don] Yeah.

558
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,961
(suspenseful music)

559
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,862
- Bruce, stop fooling around.

560
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,467
Bruce (screaming loudly)!

561

(Wayne breathing heavily) (Laura gasping)

562
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,656
- [Wayne] You'll never take Raven's place.

563
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,891
Do you understand me?

564
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,127
You'll never take her place.

565
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,596
(suspenseful music)

566
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,498
(knocking on door)

567
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,332
- Yeah?

568
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,468
(knocking on door)

569
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,436
- [Man] I forgot my light meter!

570
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,938
(suspenseful music)

571
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,905
- [Bruce] Who is it?

572
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,807
- [Man] I forgot my light meter!

573
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,109
(suspenseful music)

574
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,710
- Oh, well, come on in and get it, man.

575
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,212
- [Wayne] I am the Hooded Claw!

576
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,414
- Hey, what is, what is this, some kind of joke?

577
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,782
- [Wayne] You produced "The Hooded Claw" Brucey.

578
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,050
- Very funny, ha, ha!

579
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,085
- [Wayne] Now it's time for the sequel,

580
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,054
and I'm going to star in it!

581
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,490
- There's not gonna be any sequel, guy.

582
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,127
Now, get out there and do your Christmas shopping, go on!

583
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,195
La la la, and all that jazz, you know.

584
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,330
(door thuds)

585
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,532
What, what, hey, what're doing?

586
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,169
(Wayne laughing maniacally)

587
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:23,174
(Wayne and Bruce grunting) (suspenseful music)

588
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,845
- Bruce, wait, where you going?

589
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,781
I haven't auditioned yet!

590
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,784
(heavy metal music)

591
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,086
Ho, ho ho!

592
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,521
(gun firing)

593
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,526
You can't kill me!

594
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:19,130
You created me and I can never die!

595
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:31,442
You've been a bad boy, a very bad boy (screams).

596
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:38,249
(Wayne and Bruce growling)

597
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:43,254
(claw thudding) (both grunting)

598
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,093
(Bruce moaning)

599
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,096
(heavy metal music)

600
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,444
(Wayne panting)

601
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,584
Oh, Raven, Raven.

602
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,321
You should've saw the look

603
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,291
on that sleazeball producer of yours face.

604
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:24,228
He shot me here and here, and I just kept coming.

605
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,031
He couldn't believe it.

606
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,036
It reminded me, it reminded me of my Uncle Joe.

607
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,706
(exhales deeply)

608
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,976
It reminded me of Uncle Joe when I shot him.

609
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,312
(mysterious music)

610
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,814
I love you, Raven.

611
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,586
I'll never let anyone, anyone harm you.

612
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,737
(suspenseful music)

613
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,115
- [Raven] Hey Wayne, what's up?

614
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,951
- Hi, Raven, do you still need me to babysit tonight?

615
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,385
Are you still going on that dinner date

616
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,954
with that producer guy?

617
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,057
- First of all, Wayne, it's not a date.

618
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:29,594
I'm still trying to get back together with my husband, Eric.

619
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,996
And I think the whole thing's been postponed,

620
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,365
unless I hear otherwise.

621
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,500
- From Eric?

622
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,236
- No, from the producer, Bruce Brunswick.

623
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,437
But no one's heard from him

624
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,806
since he did that shoot with Laura Britton.

625
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,474
It's like they both disappeared.

626
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,344
- Maybe they eloped.

627
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,179
- No, I don't think so (giggles).

628
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,347
Bruce isn't the type.

629
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,215
I mean maybe Laura, but not Bruce.

630
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,285
- Well, well, love makes people do strange things, Raven.

631
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,490
- Yeah, well, this is entirely too strange.

632
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,626
Even the police think so.

633
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,793
They've questioned all of us

634
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,996
that have been shooting with Bruce.

635
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,797
They haven't come up with any leads though.

636
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:07,832
Unless they're not telling us.

637
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,067
- Well, what about the shoot?

638
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,536
Has it been scrapped?

639
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,171
- Oh, no, no, no, the director's gonna be doing

640
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,473
both his and Bruce's job.

641
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,308
- I wish you all the best of luck.

642
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,777
I'd hate for anything awful to have happened.

643
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,712
- Oh, thanks.

644
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,347
You have to do some Christmas shopping or something.

645
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,584
- Actually, I have to drop a couple of things off

646
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,654
that I've already gift wrapped.

647

701
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,677
Now show the camera what you've got.

set you up for a shot I can get up on top and.

00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,459
- Okay.

00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,293

710
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,262
Okay.

711
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,197
Let's get you down.

712
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,700

00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:36,173
Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,007
That's it, baby.

715
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:37,842
Come on now.

716
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,777
Seduce me now.

717
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,781
That's it, beautiful, beautiful.

718
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,117
(telephone ringing)

719
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,552
(Eric sighs)

720
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,920
(telephone ringing)

721
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,721
Yeah?

722
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,157
Oh, good morning, Raven.

723
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,826
I don't know how long it's gonna take.

724
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,828
You know how these things go.

725
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,597
It'll be over when it's over.

726
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,831
- The kids miss you.

727
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,034
I miss you too.

728
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,305
You know, I'm willing to make some compromises.

729
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,777
We could stay together for the sake of the kids.

730
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,044
- For the kid's sake is no reason

731
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,713
for two people to stay together.

732
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,982
- Well, okay then, for our sake.

733
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,750
I mean, we still love each other, right?

734
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,085
You can't deny that.

735
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,254
- I don't know.

736
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,257
I don't know what to think anymore.

737
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,428
Something in my life has to change.

738
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,999
Maybe my whole life has to change.

739
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,504
- Eric, you sound really confused.

740
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,972
What is it that you're not telling me?

741
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,541
Are you seeing someone else?

742
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:45,876
- No.

743
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,212
No.

744
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,914
- Well, neither am I.

745
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,784
Eric, I want you back.

746
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,220
I want to be with you.

747
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,355
I want us to be a family again.

748
00:40:58,355 --> 00:40:59,557
- What have you told the kids?

749
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,758
- Nothing, I just told them

750
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,660
that you're out doing a shoot somewhere.

751
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,597
I bought most of the stuff that they wanted from Santa.

752
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,867
I really hope that you're gonna be home

753
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,135
to see them open it up.

754
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,138
- Yeah, well ah, I'll be there for that.

755
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,842
- Eric, have you seen a lawyer yet?

756
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,376
- No, not yet.

757
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,381
- (sighs) Take care, okay, bye.

758
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:28,586
- Goodbye.

759
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,992
- My, my, isn't married life great?

760
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,895
- Why the hell don't you mind your own business?

761
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,564
(Debbie scoffs)

762
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,735
- I'm the only one you need, Raven.

763
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,304
When will you ever realize that?

764
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,272
You're in a business where there,

765
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,640
where there are no real friends,

766
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,612
no true lovers, male or female, just exploiters.

767
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,747
They only want you for your body.

768
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:57,982
They don't care about your mind!

769
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,452
They don't love you the way I do.

770
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,021
Don't treat me like my mother did, Raven.

771
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,191
Do you hear me?

772
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,829
Don't try and replace me with somebody else.

773
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,598
I was only 10 when Daddy died of pneumonia,

774
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,738
and mommy said I was gonna be her big man now.

775
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,675
It was gonna be her and I

776
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,310
against the rest of the world forever (chuckles).

777
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,448
They didn't think I'd catch them.

778
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,950
They didn't think I'd catch them and make them pay.

779
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,784

780
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,487

- I did catch them.

784
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,262
And what I did wasn't even wrong, was it, Mother?

785
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,265
Now you rot in hell, Mother (fist thuds)!

00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,968
This is my corner.

895
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,070
Traffic's good here.

896
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,739
Find your own corner or I'll black both of your eyes!

897
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,907
You hearing me?

898
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:41,845
(bell ringing) (suspenseful music)

899
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,820
(heavy metal music)

900
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,537
(suspenseful music)

901
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,016
- [Clerk] Hi.

902
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:53,984
- Hi.

903
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,452
- [Clerk] Can I help you?

904
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,253
- Yeah.

905
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:58,922
How much?

906
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,991
- [Clerk] $60.

907
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,993
- That's perfect, I'll take it.

908
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,628
- [Clerk] That's all right.

909
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,129
- It sure is cold.

910
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,164
- [Clerk] Very cold.

911
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,902
- Do, do you think it will fit?

912
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,869
- It fit very well.

913
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,774
(light jazz music)

914
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,362
(apple crunching)

915
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,135
(light jazz music)

916
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:02,953
- Hi, kitty, here.

917
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,588
You hungry, kitty?

918
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,889
Aw, Misty, what?

919
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,925
(cat meowing)

920
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,528
(mellow music)

921
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,355
Kitty, where are you going?

922
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,189
(cat meowing)

923
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,023
What?

924
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:43,693
Come here.

925
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:44,528
(cat meows)

926
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:45,362
Oh, I know.

927
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:48,798
Hi, did you miss me, huh?

928
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,436
(answer machine beeps)

929
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,338
- [Ted] Hello, Mary Jane, this is Ted.

930
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,040
I guess you're still on the set.

931
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,642
I just called to say I love you.

932
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,077
Isn't that a song title or something (chuckles)?

933
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,479
It's Stevie Wonder I think.

934
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,780
Anyway, I'll call later.

935
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,583
Don't forget our date Saturday night.

936
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,985
(answering machine beeps)

937
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,820
- [Mom] Mary Jane, this is Mom.

938
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,655
Are you there?

939
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,489
I guess not.

940
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:13,423
Give me a call.

941
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:14,591
Let me know if you're coming

942
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,126
for dinner on Sunday, you and Ted.

943
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,193
Bye, honey.

944
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,929
(answering machine beeps)

945
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,531
(mellow music)

946
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,313
(knocking on door)

947
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,686
- Damn, that can't be Ted.

948
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,622
(knocking on door)

949
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,899
- Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

950
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,867
(Mary Jane giggles)

951
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,736
I'm here for the Ryan party!

952
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,104
- No, there's no party here.

953
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,739
I wish there was though.

954
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,207
- Isn't this the Ryan's residence?

955
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,643
I must've got the wrong directions!

956
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,044
You know where the Ryan's live?

957
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,746
- Nope, sorry, Santa.

958
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,281
- Oh, their boy's gonna be so upset

959
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,717
if I don't make it to the party on time!

960
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,752
Do you think Santa can use the phone?

961
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,786
I have the phone number!

962
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,355
I just have to get directions!

963
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,590
- I don't usually let anyone in when I'm here alone.

964
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,860
- Ah, ho, ho, ho, it's Santa Claus!

965
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,062
Surely you make exceptions for Santa!

966
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,764
- Well, I guess.

967
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,966
- Thank you, you're a real doll.

968
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,203
Hi, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

969
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,407
- You can use that phone right there.

970
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,643
- Actually, I have something better to use.

971
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,847
I'm not gonna hurt you!

972
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,548
I'm not gonna hurt you!

973
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,583
Listen to me!

974
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,884
Listen to me, Raven!

975
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,387
Raven, I'm not gonna hurt you!

976
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,089
I'm not gonna hurt you!

977
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,457
Would you just listen to me?

978
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,393
Listen, listen, Raven!

979
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,194
I will never hurt you!

980
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,664
I'll never hurt you, Raven.

981
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,165
I love you.

982
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,099
I love you.

983
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,635
I love you.

984
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,938
(suspenseful music)

985
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,373
You're not Raven.

986
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,110
You're not Raven.

987
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,113
(suspenseful music)

988
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,385
(Wayne moans)

989
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:23,553
Why, why, why!

990
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:28,558
You can't do that to Santa Claus!

991
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:33,563
(Wayne panting) (Mary Jane whimpering)

992
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,534
You can't never do that to Santa!

993
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:41,171
(Wayne inhaling deeply)

994
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,005
Ah!

995
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:46,976
(Wayne exhales slowly)

996
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:52,816
How did everything go?

997
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,284
- Hi, it was good.

998
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:57,087
I got a lot of stuff done, thanks to you, Wayne.

999
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:57,921
- [Wayne] Really?

1000
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,422
- You know, I feel bad.

1001
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,057
I mean, you sure you don't mind looking after the kids?

1002
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,793
I mean a guy like yourself should be on a date or something.

1003
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,562
- No, not, not at all.

1004
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,163
I'd rather be helping you.

1005
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,431
- That's nice.

1006
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,632
- When you need my help anyway I can.

1007
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,234
I mean, that's what friends are for.

1008
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:13,603
- Did Savanah and Angela behave themselves tonight?

1009
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,939
- Oh yeah, I made them some hot chocolate,

1010
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,808
and I tired them out playing old maid.

1011
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,111
They actually fell asleep right here on the couch.

1012
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,712
I had to carry them to bed.

1013
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,014
- Wow, you mean they went to bed early?

1014
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,449
- Yeah.

1015
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,717
- Wonders will never cease.

1016
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,787
You must have the magic touch there, Wayne.

1017
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,790
(suspenseful music)

1018
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:58,948
- Hey, I thought we still had another day of shooting?

1019
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,584
(mellow music)

1020
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,219
What's the matter?

1021
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,688
You just kept telling me what great stuff we were getting.

1022
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,391
Or was that just a line to get in my pants?

1023
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,093
- We got a lot of great stuff.

1024
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,862
You were great stuff, but it's over.

1025
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,364
- [Debbie] The shooting or us?

1026
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:19,769
- Both, look, you were great,

1027
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,304
but you can console yourself with the fact

1028
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,572
that you're gonna get a great layout out of this.

1029
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,474
- You're going back to her, aren't you?

1030
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,211
- Well, I don't know how it's gonna turn out,

1031
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,647
but you can be damn sure I'm gonna give it another shot.

1032
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,917
- Ha, back to the wifey, the little kiddies,

1033
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:38,354
home for the holidays and all that cornball crap, huh?

1034
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,223
- Look, I already checked out.

1035
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,691
I paid the bill.

1036
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,661
Just make sure you leave the key at the desk when you leave.

1037
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,165
(Debbie smacks lips)

1038
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,834
- Mommy, tell us again about that guy

1039
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,936
at the horror conviction in Baltimore.

1040
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,504
- [Angela] Yeah, Mommy, yeah.

1041
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,438
- What guy?

1042
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,706
- You know, the goofy guy

1043
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,842
who said he'd stop a bullet for you.

1044
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,878
- Well, honey, fans at conventions get a little crazy.

1045
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,746
I was standing in the lobby of a hotel,

1046
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,381
and this fan comes up to me.

1047
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,718
I was having a drink and he started getting so crazy.

1048
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,720
He asked me to sign his baseball cap.

1049
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,921
(girls laughing)

1050
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,790
He asked me to send his T-shirts.

1051
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,825
He even asked me to sign his beer bottle.

1052
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,661
- Then what did he say, Mommy?

1053
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,198
- Then he told me he would do anything in the world for me.

1054
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,733
And I tried to calm him down.

1055
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,536
I said, "Listen, mister, I'm just like anyone else.

1056
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,404
"I'm just a regular person like you."

1057
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:29,672
And he wouldn't hear it.

1058
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,141
He kept telling me over and over and over again

1059
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,811
how, how he would stop a bullet for me.

1060
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,880
- Does that mean he'd die for you?

1061
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,948
- Yeah, that's what he was trying to say,

1062
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,650
but you know, he was just drunk, honey.

1063
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,185
He didn't mean what he was saying.

1064
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,621
He was just excited about being around a celebrity.

1065
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,723
- But you're not a celebrity.

1066
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,892
You're just Mommy.

1067
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:51,261
- I know, honey, but to the people who like horror movies,

1068
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,729
I am a celebrity.

1069
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:53,997
Whether you know it or not,

1070
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:56,733
your mommy has fans all over the world.

1071
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,235
- But what if they could see now in blue jeans,

1072
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,037
and with your hands in dirty dishwater?

1073
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,972
- Well, I don't think they'd believe it.

1074
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:04,540
It'd ruin their fantasies.

1075
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,843
- But Daddy knows you do dishes,

1076
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,611
and he still likes you, doesn't he?

1077
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,549
- Yeah, and I still like him.

1078
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:15,318
- When's Daddy coming home?

1079
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,188
- I think he'll be home in a couple of days, honey.

1080
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:22,458
Now, listen, Mommy has to go the movie studio tonight,

1081
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,262
but Wayne's gonna come over and babysit, okay?

1082
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:27,864
- [girls] Yay!

1083
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:29,065
- So you're gonna be good for him, right?

1084
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,300
- [Girls] Yeah!

1085
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,669
- Good, I'll bring you home something nice.

1086
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,470
(spray can rattling)

1087
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:39,475
(Wayne whistling) (spray can hissing)

1088
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,522
- Raven, what are you doing?

1089
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,691
You can't improve upon perfection.

1090
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,925
- Oh, thank you.

1091
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,026
That's why you're my favorite director.

1092
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,962
- Oh ho, yeah, I believe that.

1093
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:02,131
Listen, ah, yesterday we shot the guy, okay?

1094
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,399
- [Raven] Mm hmm.

1095
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,168
- Reacting to the fact that you weren't there

1096
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,269
for his Christmas present.

1097
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,203
- Right, mm hmm.

1098
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:11,207
- Okay, I need a shot of you--

1099
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,342
- [Raven] Mm hmm.

1100
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,176
- [Al] Here you go.

1101
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,010
- Oh, thank you.

1102
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:14,844
- Striking a pose.

1103
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:17,714
Instead of coming out of a box,

1104
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,215
we're gonna shoot it another way.

1105
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,049
- Okay.

1106
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:20,883
- Okay?

1107
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:21,718
- Yep.

1108
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:22,952
- Okay.

1109
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,487
- I'm just gonna pop and appear and that's it.

1110
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:25,755
- Yeah, it's, you're going to love it.

1111
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:26,689
- Okay.

1112
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,191
- It's gonna be a lot different

1113
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,859
than the coming out of the box type of thing, okay?

1114
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,327
- Right, okay, good, good.

1115
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,261
- Look, I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Raven.

1116
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,529
- [Raven] Mm hmm.

1117
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,797
- We're gonna lock the camera on the tripod,

1118
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,066
and we'll shoot the set without you on it, okay?

1119
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,368
- Right.

1120
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,837
- Then we'll have you pop in with that pose.

1121
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,105
- [Raven] Mm hmm.

1122
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:42,939
- You know, just a, yeah, you know?

1123
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:43,906
- [Both] Something sexy.

1124
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:44,774
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1125
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,608
- Okay, mm hmm.

1126
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:46,442
- Okay.

1127
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,744
- No problem.

1128
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,112
- And then we'll take it into the editing suite.

1129
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,380
- [Raven] Mm hmm.

1130
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,615
- And we'll do the ah, sudden appearance of you

1131
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,551
with a lot of splash and sparkles, okay?

1132
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,519
- Great, mm hmm.

1133
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,487
- And it'll look wonderful.

1134
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,755
- Excellent, let's do it.

1135
01:00:58,755 --> 01:00:59,989
- Okay, wait till I get set here.

1136
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:00,923
- Okay, just start with the pose.

1137
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,025
Al, could you just take this?

1138
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,159
Thanks so much.

1139
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,495
Great, okay.

1140
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,629
- Okay, are you ready?

1141
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,498
- Okay, you ready?

1142
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,665
Ah, okay, and.

1143
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:11,634
- Action.

1144
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:12,802
- Ta-da!

1145
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,437
- Great, I love it.

(Casey whimpering)

1150
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,005
- Casey, hey boy!

1151
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,873

1152
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,341

01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,217
Hey, boy, you happy to see me, boy?

1155
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,319
Because I might be sleeping with you tonight.

1156
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:04,454

1183
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,576
Eric, what's wrong?

1184
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,910
You sound so upset.

1185
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,313
- Yeah, Mom, I just got in and Raven's not here.

1186
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:12,715
Yeah, well, the kids look like they've been drugged.

1187

I can't even wake them up.

1188
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,219
Do you have any idea why she'd leave them like this?

1189
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,821
- We haven't heard from her for a week and a half.

1190
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,724
She never asks us to babysit anymore,

1191
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:24,527
but I got to worrying and I called over there today,

1192
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,597
and your next door neighbor, that Wayne fellow,

1193
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,265
answered the phone and said he was babysitting,

1194
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,167
and that the kids were fine.

1195
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,068
- Well, where the hell is he?

1196
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,803
- I don't know.

1197
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:35,304
Are you sure he's not still there?

1198
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,706
Maybe he's upstairs asleep,

1199
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,575
or ah, maybe ran next door for something.

1200
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:40,610
- Mom, nobody's here.

1201
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,411
I'm the only one here.

1202
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,914
I never trusted that little punk anyway.

1203
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,149
If he was supposed to be babysitting, then he drugged them.

1204
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:48,684
He doped them up.

1205
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,953
Please, can you and Peggy get over here right away?

1206
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,121

1249
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,954
but, but I haven't heard from Raven,

1250
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,056
and that, that freak, Wayne, seems to have vanished too.

1251
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,525
- Well, do you suppose they could've run off together?

1252
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:17,726
- She'd never do that.

1253
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,094
No matter what else she is, she isn't evil.

1254
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:20,362
She's just selfish.

1255
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,665
She'd never do anything to hurt those children.

1256
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:24,066
- Then where the hell is she?

1257
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,501
- She might be at the film studio

1258
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,470
where they make the silly Scream Queen videos.

1259
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,172
That's where she was last time we babysat.

1260
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:35,177
♪ Scream Queen, you're all that I desire ♪

1261
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:40,583

(heavy metal music)

1265
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,397
- Why don't you phone the studio first?

1266
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,433
- Because if she's there and I think she is,

1267
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,801
I don't want her to know I'm coming.

1268
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,069
I'm gonna catch her by surprise,

1269
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,371
and find out for myself exactly what's going on.

1270
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,472
And if that Wayne's there.

1271
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,640
- Oh, watch out for that one.

1272
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,741
I've never trusted him.

1273
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,077
He's sly and sneaky like a cat.

1274
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,778
Be careful, son!

1275
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,113
- They seem to be okay.

1276
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,481
I think they're just sleeping.

1277
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,484

- Ooh, Merry Christmas (lips smacking).

1284
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,148
- Mm, cut, cut.

1285
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:19,982
(Raven laughing)

1286
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:20,916
That was great.

1287
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:21,817
I love that ending there.

1288
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:22,751
- Did it work?

1289
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:23,485
- Yeah, yeah, it was great.

1290
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,320
- Great.

1291
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,821
- Okay, that's a wrap.

1292
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,157
Just ah, clean everything up and let's get outta here.

1293
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,525
- [Man] Roll up those cables!

1294
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:30,359
Roll them up.

1295
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,594
Get them out of the way.

1296
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:32,795
- So, you gonna need me tomorrow?

1297
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:34,930
- Ah, I think your straps undone.

1298
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,932
- (laughs) Thanks (giggles).

1299
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,233
- Okay, ah, no, I think we got everything.

1300
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:39,201
- [Man] Hey, give me the reflector.

1301
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,035
I'll put it in the case, Al.

1302
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,570
- Ah, thank you.

1303
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,138
- You're welcome, it's a pleasure to work with you.

1304
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:45,641
- It's a pleasure to work with you too, until then.

1305
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:46,475
- Okay.

1306
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:47,743
- Okay.

1307
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,978
- [Man] Just pull those cables out of the way.

1308
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:49,812
We don't want anybody tripping on them.

1309
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,781

01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:02,057

1311
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:28,250
(suspenseful music)

1312
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:39,355
(Wayne growling) (woman screaming)

1313
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,324
(suspenseful music)

1314
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:47,329
(Wayne grunting) (woman gasping)

1315
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:54,403
- I'm glad we're just about done here.

1316
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,804
I got some shopping to do.

1317
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:56,972
- Yeah, I know.

1318
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,340
I gotta go buy a Barbie doll for my kid.

1319
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,641
(doorbell ringing)

1320
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,510
Oh, let me go see who the hell that is.

1321
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:11,286
Yeah, can I help you?

1322
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,287
- Yeah, I'm Eric Quinn.

1323
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:13,222
Is my wife here?

1324
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,656
- Ah yeah, she's upstairs.

1325
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,091
I need to see some ID first.

1326
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,564
All right, that's cool.

1327
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,632
She's up in the dressing room.

1328
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,200
You know where it is?

1329
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,604
- Yeah, I'm not just, Raven, the Scream Queen's husband.

1330
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,339
I'm Eric Quinn, the photographer.

1331
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,775
I'm practically on staff here for Christ's sake.

1332
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,885
- [Man] Hey, I'm just doing my job, man.

1333
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,387
(man gasping)

1334
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,124
- And I'm just doing my job, man.

1335
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:51,827
(man gasping)

1336
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:52,661
- [Eric] Raven!

1337
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,164
- Eric, I thought you were in Akron?

1338
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,598
- Yeah, yeah, and you thought

1339
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:57,599
your next door neighbor, Wayne,

1340
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,168
was watching the kids too.

1341
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,369
What else did you think, Raven?

1342
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,904
- What are you talking about, Eric?

1343
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,339
Wayne is babysitting the kids, isn't he?

1344
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,608
- Wayne drugged the kids and he's disappeared!

1345
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,677
God only knows what's going on here!

1346
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,245
- Well, who's watching the kids.

1347
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:12,014
- Well, my mother and sister over,

1348
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,415
and Dr. Branstetter's on his way,

1349
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:16,185
but I hope to God everything's okay.

1350
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,954
I wanna know what the hell's going on here, Raven.

1351
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,689
And you've got some explaining to do.

1352
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,025
- I just, I have to just get changed, Eric.

1353
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,126
My car's in the parking lot.

1354
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:24,960
- Leave your car here.

1355
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,428
You come home with me.

1356
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:28,430
We have some things to straighten out,

1357
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,732
before we can decide on where we're gonna go from here.

1358
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:34,436
- [Wayne] Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

1359
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,404
- Who the hell is this?

1360
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:39,575
(Wayne laughing maniacally)

1361
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,509
Who is it?

1362
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:41,543
- [Raven] Is anyone there?

1363
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:45,948
(Wayne laughing maniacally)

1364
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,551
- [Wayne] Ho, ho, ho, Raven (laughing maniacally)!

1365
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:52,654
- Wayne, is that you?

1366
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,656
- I'm not Wayne.

1367
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,825
I'm Santa Claws!

1368
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,861
- Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

1369
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,629
Think about what you're doing.

1370
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,599
- Santa Claws knows what you want for Christmas, Raven!

1371
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:06,401
To get rid of that cheating husband of yours,

1372
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,204
and I'm here to make your wish come true (laughing)!

1373
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:11,373
- Wayne, I can help you!

1374
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:12,407
- [Wayne] You wanna put Wayne away

1375
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,909
like his mother wanted to do!

1376
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,777
- No, no, Wayne, stop!

1377
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,813
- [Wayne] Wayne doesn't need your help!

1378
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,715
He needs your love, Raven!

1379
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,783
Wayne loves you, Raven!

1380
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:24,553
When will you realize that?

1381
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,923
That's why he killed that sleazeball producer!

1382
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,325
He did it all for you!

1383
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:31,360
- You're insane!

1384
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,663
(Wayne growling) (Raven screams)

1385
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:35,764
- No, no, no!

1386
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:42,538
(heavy metal music) (men grunting)

1387
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,372
Stop!

1388
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,441
Stop it, stop it!

1389
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:48,477
You, ugh!

1390
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:54,383
(heavy metal music) (men grunting)

1391
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,819
Stop it, no, no, no!

1392
01:15:59,087 --> 01:15:59,922
No, no!

1393
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,760
(Raven grunts)

1394
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,763
(heavy metal music)

1395
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:31,253
(Wayne mumbling) (heavy metal music)

1396
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:36,291
- [Wayne] Seasons greetings!

1397
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,494
Santa Claws is coming to town!

1398
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:40,963
(heavy metal music)

1399
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,130
(Eric grunts)

1400
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:45,133
(heavy metal music)

1401
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,642
You can't do that to Santa, Raven!

1402
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:56,645
Ho, ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

1403
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,648
(suspenseful music)

1404
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:03,986
(door thuds) (Eric grunts)

1405
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:06,021
- [Raven] Oh, God!

1406
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:06,955
Oh, my God!

1407
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,557
- [Wayne] Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1408
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,392
Merry Christmas, Eric!

1409
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,429
(Raven grunting and gasping)

1410
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:17,899
Raven, you can't hide from Santa Claws!

1411
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:21,703
Raven, you're turning me into the Scrooge.

1412
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,740
- Please, don't, I'm begging you.

1413
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,275
Please don't do this (crying).

1414
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:28,443
I'm your friend!

1415
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,879
Wayne, please, please!

1416
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,949
You gotta call the cops and turn yourself in!

1417
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,917
- [Wayne] You know, Wayne's mother used to always tell him

1418
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,420
to turn himself in, you see,

1419
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,889
so if you're gonna turn on Wayne,

1420
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:43,725
then Santa Claws is gonna have to kill you.

1421
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,661
- [Raven] No (crying), no!

1422
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:50,132
