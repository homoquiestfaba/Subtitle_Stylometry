00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:08,477
"Put on the full armor of God, to be able to stand

2
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:10,546
Against the wiles of the Devil,

3
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:13,949
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,153
BUT AGAINST ... SPIRITUAL FORCES OF EVIL

5
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:20,611
IN HEAVENLY REGlÕES. "(Ephesians 6:11-12)

6
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:42,278
My name is Luke O'Brian.

7
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:44,914
Working as a salesman during the day.

8
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:48,884
At night, I attended the faculty of law Billy Simon,

9
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:50,613
in Sydney, Australia.

10
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:55,087
My goal in life has always been to become a lawyer,

11
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:56,926
until ...

12
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:57,393
The Devil in the dock santacruz [A More Passionate Fans of Brazil]: P

13
00:00:57,393 --> 00:01:00,863
The Devil in the dock some tragedies have made me question my own existence.

14
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:01,887
Some tragedies have made me question my own existence.

15
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:08,764
I wonder why the Lord allows Satan to do so much.

16
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:13,432
This was the worst year of my life.

17
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:32,891
Today, the country was struck by another mass murder.

18
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,521
This time a gunman killed 15 people in a hospital and then killed himself.

19
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:41,892
This is unacceptable.

20
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:44,874
No, it's ridiculous.

21
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:47,035
As an account can disappear?

22
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:52,147
Some human garbage and you stole my money ...

23
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,672
What kind of idiots working there?

24
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,314
Luke, stop it!

25
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,283
Honey.

26
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,861
Honey, are you okay? Sorry.

27
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,930
I was brought back to reality.

28
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,865
The world is lost.

29
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:12,368
Another news says that the price of gasoline continues to rise

30
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:15,360
and the oil companies do not give explanations.

31
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:17,506
"My God!" Sean, who hadn't seen the phenomenon earlier, cried out.

32
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:19,441
you see how things are?

33
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,044
My mother was killed by a drunk driver, Gwen,

34
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:24,813
and that same driver is loose in the streets,

35
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:28,017
together with other outcasts, including those who stole our money.

36
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:31,086
If I had Satan in my hands right now,

37
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,255
I cut into small pieces.

38
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:36,383
And do the same with the damn that killed my mother!

39
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,524
I go to the college library.

40
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,370
Everyone needs compassion,

41
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,396
a love that never fails.

42
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:58,171
What mercy upon me.

43
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:01,948
Do not tell me that I left the bullets in the house!

44
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:06,587
Then something happened.

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,891
Suddenly, a Bible came in the glove compartment.

46
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:25,337
I would have so departed from God what he thought about killing a man?

47
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,676
Why could not forgive him?

48
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:30,909
Why?

49
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:36,352
How I became what I am now?

50
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:39,388
A man who hated people ...

51
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,879
instead of loving my neighbor.

52
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,617
Who am I?

53
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:58,774
Take me as I am,

54
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:01,675
all my fears and failures.

55
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:08,149
Complete my life again.

56
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:13,953
Upon returning home, I realized that the spiritual battle we all face.

57
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:19,395
Satan approaches you as a lion, brothers and sisters,

58
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,263
do not forget it.

59
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:26,530
The biggest lie is to convince you that it does not exist.

60
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:33,399
And I believe in the devil.

61
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,743
Suddenly I realized that.

62
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,514
All the world's problems

63
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:41,677
somehow relate to this evil being.

64
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,587
So many lies and deception.

65
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,923
And because of this serpent,

66
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:51,260
the world becomes increasingly worse.

67
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,128
Then I thought about making a daring thing.

68
00:04:55,798 --> 00:05:00,536
If the world is turning into a hell, I can try to kill some demons.

69
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:04,472
That was the day I decided to expose him.

70
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:09,111
Yes, you heard me right. Exposing Satan.

71
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:12,740
And I can show the wiles of the devil better than anyone.

72
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:18,120
If all we do, I can process only one

73
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,611
who brought the world their worst pain.

74
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:26,795
Luke O'Brian against Satan?

75
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:28,530
- That's right.

76
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,932
Satan?

77
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:31,365
Yes, exactly.

78
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:33,728
He's last name?

79
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,028
PROCESSED

80
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:41,610
I had the address of Satan to send a copy of the process,

81
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,376
but I have walked the path to a hearing before a judge.

82
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,078
Luke O'Brian against Satan?

83
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,780
Yes, Your Honor.

84
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,684
Satan is processing?

85
00:05:58,393 --> 00:05:59,325
"Crazy?

86
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,029
Order!

87
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,131
Yes, Your Honor.

88
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:05,167
Are you aware that is the international court of human rights?

89
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:09,831
Your Honor, Satan has violated all human rights know that!

90
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,641
- It is with a psychiatrist?
- No.

91
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:15,110
- Do you take any medicine?
-Yes.

92
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,873
No, I was taking.

93
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:21,250
Mr. O'Brian is wasting the court with this ridiculous process.

94
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,987
Your Honor, I can prove that Satan is a viable defendant.

95
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:26,755
Through the process "Dogar versus Marlboro"

96
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:29,525
and Section 10-3 of the processes of international civil liberties ...

97
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:32,461
Very well. I understand.

98
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:36,329
And of course, Satan did not respond to this quote.

99
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:38,828
I would like to bring a prosecution in absentia.

100
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:42,905
And how do you expect to make that statement?

101
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:45,440
I've had to put in the newspaper.

102
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,276
Do you still read these things?

103
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,745
Yes, and I think that may be accepted if necessary.

104
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:52,548
Try to meet him in hell next time. Just a hint.

105
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:55,284
I knew she would nullify the cause.

106
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:58,320
I just wanted to vent my frustration against Satan.

107
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,891
But what she said next took me by surprise.

108
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:07,529
You'll have to send a notification to the defendant in this case, Satan.

109
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,327
Through a bailiff. I give you another 30 days.

110
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,200
But I can not do that, Your Honor.

111
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:17,506
I can not allow trials in absentia unless the defendant is cited.

112
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:18,530
Next case!

113
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:29,711
"What's this?
- It is a case against Satan.

114
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:34,022
- Is this a joke?
- No, it is not.

115
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,616
If it works here, I want to hand it to him.

116
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,697
70 lawyers work here. Choose who you want.

117
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:42,857
I see.

118
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,266
Hey, man,

119
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,439
why do you think Satan works here?

120
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,008
Give it to him to find it, okay?

121
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:56,645
Hey, this is a serious company, okay?

122
00:07:56,645 --> 00:08:00,182
Yes, we have strippers, drunks and gamblers, but you know what?

123
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,884
Do not allow smoking inside, you know?

124
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:05,284
You are Satan worshipers?

125
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:11,491
Could they deliver it to him if they find him?

126
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,560
Thank you."

127
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:22,602
I see that the process gave a law firm,

128
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:27,799
a strip club, an investment agency and an oil company.

129
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,700
Why stop there?

130
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,381
Tried to deliver a shopping used car?

131
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,281
If Satan is somewhere you can be there.

132
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:37,713
Yeah, I did not think about it, Your Honor.

133
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:56,392
Would you like a trial in absentia against Satan.

134
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,273
Trial in absentia?

135
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:00,642
Yes, Your Honor. I want it plowed ...

136
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:05,011
that the case against him is 8 trillion dollars.

137
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:10,977
I will undo this process for technical details,

138
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:13,789
and because you are crazy.

139
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:16,291
Then the most amazing thing happened.

140
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,294
I will also penalize Io, because ...

141
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:20,886
Why?

142
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,628
I am here, Your Honor.

143
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:34,774
Have you had this strange feeling that a fake can be real, anyway?

144
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,274
And who are you?

145
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:46,420
- Satan, Your Honor.
- Oh, Your Honor.

146
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,780
Very beautiful.

147
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,328
So you two are in this together?

148
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:56,231
I am here to respond to the citation, Your Honor.

149
00:09:56,231 --> 00:10:01,498
And I will address the process of Mr. Luke O'Brien.

150
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,862
"What's this?

151
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,540
Very good.

152
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:13,843
you almost got me.

153
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,516
Made my day.

154
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:20,311
It's a trick question? Where are the cameras?

155
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:24,656
Sorry, but it is very serious, Your Honor.

156
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,598
For I am not amused at all.

157
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:30,963
Neither did I.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,025
Can prove that it is Satan?

159
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,139
Can you prove that I am?

160
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:49,176
____What is happening here?

161
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:54,211
Oh, my God! It's so hot here! Bailiff?

162
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,918
Bailiff? Why does the heater is on?

163
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,850
What do you think?

164
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,992
Oh, my God! Bailiff!

165
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,889
What happened to the heater? Check it out.

166
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,872
Assuming that whoever says it is,

167
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:13,670
realize the extent of what you're saying?

168
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,813
The land is mine. And I'll defend myself.

169
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,872
You have legal representation?

170
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:28,751
If I have legal representation?

171
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:50,879
I know what they are thinking. No need to say.

172
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,643
That man would be even the devil?

173
00:11:56,585 --> 00:12:01,189
I must say you have a lot of courage, boy. Sue me!

174
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:04,647
Do you really know what you're getting into?

175
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,629
You are not Satan himself, is it?

176
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:11,622
And you're not Luke's silly, is not stupid?

177
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:18,062
For it is good to get good lawyers, because I'll beat you.

178
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:21,810
You're just a moron. Do you know how insignificant?

179
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,445
After all, in an instant ...

180
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:27,649
I can send you a small boat into the deep red.

181
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,254
Hey, I have God on my side, okay? And He created you.

182
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:33,955
Have a card there?

183
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,758
- I have no card.
"No?"

184
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,453
Well, here's mine.

185
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:42,190
Call whenever you want.

186
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:45,999
Hey, do not aspire to smoke.

187
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,572
See you in court, kid.

188
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,286
Oh, I know. Nice sleight of hand.

189
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:13,762
I needed someone to help me. Someone you trust.

190
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:16,424
There was only one person I knew.

191
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:18,196
Disappear.

192
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,870
Please, Mel. Do not talk like that to a friend.

193
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,532
Friends do not invite friends to render Satan.

194
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:29,608
I really need your help on this, please.

195
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:32,847
Luke, I just graduated.

196
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:35,917
My first case is not a suit against Satan.

197
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,407
Find another sucker.

198
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,318
Mel!

199
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,167
Do you judge set the date for the trial next week

200
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,830
What surprised everyone in the courtroom, including me.

201
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:59,975
After that, I was called to give a million interviews,

202
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:03,001
which, of course, refused.

203
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,340
Honey, I.

204
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:10,852
They may call it crazy, but Luke O'Brien is suing the devil.

205
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,454
Do you judge was about to dismiss the case

206
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:16,358
until a man appeared claiming to be the devil.

207
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:19,555
It was another day in court in Sydney weird.

208
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:23,298
Are you sure you want to continue with this?

209
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:25,289
Yes, of course.

210
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:31,967
The devil is responsible for what the world is going.

211
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:34,502
You said it yourself.

212
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:37,970
Yes, but I told you to go to court to sue Io.

213
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,254
Why are you doing this, Luke?

214
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:57,422
Because the devil is real and I have to expose Io.

215
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,659
I have to expose Io.

216
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,276
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

217
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:13,548
Thank you for coming so quickly to an important event.

218
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:17,452
Now, without further ado, I present my client,

219
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,717
who prefers to be called "Prince."

220
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,793
Here it is, your dream team.

221
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,128
The best lawyers around the world ...

222
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:29,531
are in Sydney for this trial.

223
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:30,589
"Great!

224
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:40,108
Here, you, your dream team.

225
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:43,978
The best, the brightest, the smartest lawyers in the world.

226
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,741
And also the most expensive.

227
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:53,121
Mr. Ice, Oxford, his IQ is 214.

228
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:56,324
He helped bring down a law that tried to find a cure for cancer.

229
00:15:56,324 --> 00:16:00,028
I'm not sure about cancer, after all ...

230
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:04,899
when people are dying of cancer, they think more of God, is not it?

231
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,236
Now, do not be so paranoid, Prince, because ...

232
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,839
God is also cursed, right?

233
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,408
Curse God. This is an intelligent response.

234
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:15,239
Well, I liked you.

235
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:20,014
Miss. Black, graduated from Yale.

236
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:22,550
The youngest and best lawyer in New York.

237
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,587
67 wins and no losses.

238
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:28,656
Helped defeat an electric car in court.

239
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,892
Your customers, oil.

240
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:35,363
What would you say if I offered you $ 100 million

241
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:39,493
and asked in exchange for his soul?

242
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,160
100 million for my soul?

243
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,137
Why pay?

244
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,976
Thank you. Good answer.

245
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:50,645
- I like this team.
- Nice to meet you, Prince.

246
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:53,248
Mr. Thinktank, Harvard-educated lawyer.

247
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:54,516
- Thinktank.
____How are you lady?

248
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:57,719
Helped defeat the rights of passengers.

249
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,922
Your customers are the airlines.

250
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:03,591
Aviation? I hate aviation.

251
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,926
But I love, however,

252
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:09,197
see people in those long lines, is not it?

253
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:13,835
Waiting for security, removing his shoes.

254
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,670
I love to watch it!

255
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,407
And charge for excess baggage. It was my initiative.

256
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:22,076
Did you? I love greed.

257
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:24,679
- Welcome to the team.
- Thank you, sir.

258
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,113
Very well. Ms. Shy.

259
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:30,151
University of Sydney. His name is famous.

260
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,654
She is a shark in the courtroom.

261
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:36,991
I knew that was not satisfied with their pay.

262
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,016
All work by many dollars.

263
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,332
And it very well. And there are many dollars to you?

264
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,323
Ten million in cash.

265
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:49,534
See how she is bold?

266
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:52,340
Sith, please.

267
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,434
Not interested in defeating Satan?

268
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,312
That way, no, I'm not.

269
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:01,716
Nobody is helping me in this case.

270
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,241
Also, think of all the publicity.

271
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,088
Will be in every newspaper.

272
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,257
You will have many customers then

273
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:11,350
he will not even know where to start.

274
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:16,928
Seriously, I need your help. Please.

275
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:22,066
Luke, and even if the man is Satan? Have you thought about it?

276
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:24,072
"Yeah...and so what?"

277
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:27,075
You know that God is on my side. On our side.

278
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,444
God is on our side.

279
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:31,079
God....

280
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,741
You know that God does not like for breakfast?

281
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,041
Of cereals and nuts. And you're crazy.

282
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:43,491
Mr. Innocent. Io will adore. She graduated from Columbia.

283
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:46,361
Represents all the casinos in Las Vegas.

284
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:49,030
Las Vegas? He plays here, my friend.

285
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,866
It's my town. I love Las Vegas.

286
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:56,137
All those players, those idiots who lose everything.

287
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:59,908
I love when they play in 16 and gives 5.

288
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:02,810
All those guys idiots. I love it!

289
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,979
They are so disappointed!

290
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:09,117
I helped defeat a ridiculous case against passive smoking in casinos.

291
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:13,521
They said that a casino one hour equals three months of secondhand smoke.

292
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,090
Oh, I know. And what happened?

293
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,027
As in my úItima poker game, I won, of course.

294
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:23,123
I will defeat Luke O'Brian, he will give me great joy.

295
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:26,167
The Lord will do this.

296
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,500
Seriously. And you will take action and do so.

297
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:33,641
Okay, Luke. If I agree to help you,

298
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:37,879
will you promise to the end, no matter what happens?

299
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,541
- Why not?
- Then promise.

300
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:42,614
I promise.

301
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,352
Okay. I agree. Let's move on.

302
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,491
Thank you very much.

303
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:53,594
Mr. Inyourface, the faculty of Stanford.

304
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:56,197
Oh, Stanford, very good.

305
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:58,800
I know it sounds very selfish, sir, but ...

306
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,569
I am the greatest, so do not worry about anything.

307
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:04,595
Great. That's not what Muhammad Ali said?

308
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:08,776
- Prof. Fields, University of New York.
- Hi, teacher!

309
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,746
It's a ridiculous process and we will win.

310
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:16,351
Very well. Ridiculous. Winning. That sounds good. Thank you.

311
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:21,220
And finally, Miss. Scarlett.

312
00:20:21,823 --> 00:20:24,621
It represents the tobacco industry.

313
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:29,530
No need to say more.

314
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,566
It is an honor to represent Io, sir.

315
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,194
Most of what they say about you is not true.

316
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,706
What do you mean? What they say about me?

317
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:41,909
I'm always slandered by these believers idiots.

318
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:45,504
About how much you are bad. It is not true.

319
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,778
Not at all! I am much worse.

320
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:55,554
A quick question. Raise your hands those who believe in God.

321
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,586
Very well. Raise your hands those who love God.

322
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:05,060
Like it? Like it? Like it? No one.

323
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:10,371
I think Luke O'Brien is our enemy as you.

324
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:15,035
He does not like God. But that still does not know that.

325
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:19,847
Very well. As everyone knows, this trial will be seen around the world.

326
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:23,977
Needless to say, my client never loses.

327
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,184
Never.

328
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:30,046
And what we know about this Luke O'Brian?

329
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:33,961
No need to worry about Luke O'Brian. He is finished.

330
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:37,198
Well, we should not underestimate Io.

331
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:40,690
We will not. That's why you'll end up with him.

332
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:47,105
And then came the first day of trial.

333
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:54,210
The jury was selected in a random electronic process following a new law.

334
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:57,609
That was crazy.

335
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:06,260
We are in front of the International Court of Human Rights,

336
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,864
where Luke O'Brian should arrive.

337
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:12,133
Look. He is there!

338
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,502
Luke! Luke! Luke!

339
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:18,199
I have a serious question for you. You're an idiot?

340
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,200
No.

341
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:24,812
- Luke, can not be taking this case seriously.
- Of course I'm serious.

342
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,814
Do you really believe he is the devil?

343
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:29,078
The devil is alive and well.

344
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,153
Luke, Luke, why are you suing the devil?

345
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,156
He ruined my life, ruined the world.

346
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,987
He has to pay for it.

347
00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:39,627
- And do you really think have a chance?
-Yes.

348
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:41,788
I really believe, at heart.

349
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:52,540
Satan! Satan! It has something to say?

350
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,208
I always have something to say.

351
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,907
- Are you really Satan?
- Of course. Want to dance with Satan?

352
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,918
Hopes that the public believes is Satan?

353
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:06,654
Expects the public to believe that you should ...

354
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:10,420
$ 12,000 on credit cards?

355
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,061
____How do you know?
- You can start paying.

356
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,689
If it is Satan, then prove it.

357
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:19,162
Well, check this out.

358
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,039
I think he was surprised.

359
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:29,744
I can only say that ...

360
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,780
the world is full of losers.

361
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,384
How many people will sue me and blame me

362
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:39,587
because they could not do what is right?

363
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:42,456
Got it? They are losers.

364
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:45,660
Mr. Luke O'Brien, are you listening?

365
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,662
Satan, just want to say that I'm your fan

366
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:49,497
I love you, I'm crazy about you.

367
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,399
- I love the group Kiss.
What?"

368
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,923
Kiss! Kiss!

369
00:23:56,804 --> 00:24:00,171
I hate Kiss. I prefer Tom Jones.

370
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,381
YOU DECIDE THE VERDICT WITH BARRY POLK

371
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:12,053
It will be the trial of the century, will be seen by audiences around the world.

372
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:15,356
Welcome to the "You Decide the Verdict."

373
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:17,758
I'm Barry Polk, and are now with me ...

374
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,594
Tony "Light" Anzaldo,

375
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:22,496
and Jasmine Williams. Welcome.

376
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,564
Tony, let's start with you.

377
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:27,432
Do you think that Luke O'Brian has a chance against Satan?

378
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:31,770
No.

379
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,564
Very well. Jasmine?

380
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:37,645
I think the world is rooting for Luke O'Brian,

381
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:40,381
and we all hope he wins.

382
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,609
"I don't...

383
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:46,721
We talk to Mark Engstrom, who is on the subject there ...

384
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:49,757
Tony, you'll love this. London, England.

385
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:50,746
Mark?

386
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,364
Barry, all in England are fascinated with this case.

387
00:24:56,364 --> 00:25:01,636
And the question we all ask is: Is it really Satan?

388
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:04,205
Mark, excuse me a moment. We go back now

389
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:06,696
because the trial about to begin.

390
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,902
Stand-up

391
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,408
You may be seated.

392
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:50,550
The court is in session.

393
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,783
Are you sure you want to take this forward?

394
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,425
- No.
- The jury was chosen by a process ...

395
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,994
Well, yes.

396
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,518
She's OK.

397
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,067
Since none of the parties accept an agreement,

398
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:08,002
go to trial.

399
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:10,971
And want it very quickly, get it?

400
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:15,009
Have transformed our court to the media circus.

401
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,445
Promoter, its preliminary statement.

402
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:20,243
- Promoter!
- Yes, Your Honor.

403
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,083
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

404
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:31,492
I feel a little inadequate, after all ...

405
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:34,729
I'm doing the devil himself.

406
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:36,630
but...

407
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,124
is very important to remember that the world is at stake here.

408
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:44,972
And that this being has been the cause of all suffering in the world.

409
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:47,475
Your Honor, I protest!

410
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:52,777
My client is not a being, a fallen angel.

411
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:56,844
Right. Carry on, Mr. O'Brian.

412
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,658
That evil fallen angel is the cause of pain and suffering of the whole human race.

413
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,494
Objection, Your Honor.

414
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:09,725
He is assuming facts not yet proven.

415
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,730
It assumes that Satan is evil.

416
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:16,771
Denied. Carry on, Mr. O'Brian.

417
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:18,506
Thank you, Your Honor.

418
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:21,809
Prove, with a preponderance of evidence,

419
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:25,746
he has caused all the problems and pains of this world.

420
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:28,416
And the verdict should be against him,

421
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,646
at 8 trillion dollars.

422
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:36,686
"GOD IS DEAD"

423
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:38,118
Order!

424
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,890
Order!

425
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,064
Order!

426
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:47,802
Satan! Satan! Satan!

427
00:27:47,802 --> 00:27:49,360
Order!

428
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:51,461
Order!

429
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,808
Defense attorney, his preliminary statements.

430
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,616
The audacity,

431
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:07,922
was a tremendous audacity,

432
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:12,426
make you my friends, leave their jobs

433
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:15,095
trial for this nonsense.

434
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,331
It's unbelievable!"
- Objection!

435
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:21,335
Maintained. Defender, please, no personal attacks.

436
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,503
Sorry, Your Honor.

437
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:27,873
Assuming, just for argument, that my client is really Satan,

438
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:33,414
prove that this man is not responsible

439
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:35,749
the problems that man with society.

440
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:40,020
And it is disturbing and reprehensible

441
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,225
it processes this man who did him no harm.

442
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:47,127
I finished. We can start the trial.

443
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:49,618
Promoter, its first witness.

444
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:53,661
Pastor Matthews,

445
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,171
- Satan is real?
- Yes, it is.

446
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:59,573
The Bible literally tells us so.

447
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:03,210
The name of Satan is mentioned 47 times in Bible verses,

448
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,513
- And the devil ...
- Objection, Your Honor.

449
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:09,450
The Bible can not be admitted as evidence in court.

450
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,818
Your Honor,

451
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:15,623
the Bible is the historical source more reliable than any that exists.

452
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,691
You can leave. There is even fiction.

453
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,226
Continue, pastor.

454
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:22,753
Be magnanimous. Let him use it. We will win it.

455
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:28,769
Satan, when he tried to Jesus, called for three things:

456
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,105
The temptation of the flesh,

457
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:33,471
the temptation of the eyes,

458
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:37,611
and pride that exists in man.

459
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,713
And what is his mission?

460
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,749
He opposes all that is good,

461
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:45,583
and tries to destroy the work of Jesus Christ.

462
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,655
That's right.

463
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,886
Destroy the work of Jesus Christ.

464
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,821
No further questions, Your Honor.

465
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,000
What is it, Pastor?

466
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,235
It is an apple.

467
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,537
And if I said this is the apple

468
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:06,507
bit that Eve in the Garden of Eden?

469
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:08,676
{0}- Believe{/0} {1} me ...{/1}
- No.

470
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,811
Why?
- Why the apple that Eve bit ...

471
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,779
was full of worms now.

472
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,916
Brilliant deduction.

473
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:19,820
And there sat our client is guilty of destroying this man's life because ...

474
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,059
The Scripture says that Satan is a roaring lion seeking who will devour.

475
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:27,528
It seems to me very guilty.

476
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:30,497
And this apple is not the Garden of Eden?

477
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:33,200
I understand your question. Of course not.

478
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,724
Of course.

479
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:40,074
No further questions, Your Honor.

480
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:43,110
We have high drama on the first day of this ...

481
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,946
international trial live from Sydney, Australia.

482
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:49,149
We welcome all who are watching us.

483
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,918
Tony, comments?

484
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,020
Of course, the lawyers of Satan are having fun today.

485
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,089
This boy, Luke, I am sorry for him because they do not know what to do,

486
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:58,718
and if not careful, they will eat lunch in Io.

487
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:00,525
Jasmine?

488
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:04,698
Let us not forget that mankind is at stake.

489
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,668
That is a struggle of good against evil.

490
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:10,262
Jasmine has understanding, okay?

491
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,274
Satan is being processed, right?

492
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:18,946
Satan is the one being attacked by this idiot

493
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:22,549
which is threatening to put Iowa in prison.

494
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,245
Please have a little sympathy.

495
00:31:26,854 --> 00:31:28,754
We will return soon after.

496
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,992
Your Honor, I would call John Door of Petroleum Windmile to testify.

497
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:38,932
Objection, Your Honor! What is the relevance of the witness, may I ask?

498
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,834
Think man, think.

499
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:44,065
Oil company, Satan, evil!

500
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:53,881
- You are John Door, Windmile of Oil?
- Yes, I am.

501
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:57,718
- Why are oil prices so high, sir?
- It's too high?

502
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,820
I did not realize.

503
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,017
Did not you notice? Is it so stupid?

504
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,522
Your Honor!

505
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:07,594
Sorry. Sorry.

506
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:11,799
Promoter, no personal attacks. I clear?

507
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,967
Yes, Your Honor. Sorry. Slipped.

508
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:16,603
Your Honor, I want the record in the file

509
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,641
that this observation was not only unpleasant anti-Christian

510
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:24,133
as well as vile and evil.

511
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,948
- Was observed.
Thank you!

512
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:28,849
Continue."

513
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:31,452
What you and all the other losers should do

514
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:36,048
is to earn more money and stop complaining.

515
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,826
Why do not you reduce the price of gasoline?

516
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:42,796
Because of the money. We have to make a profit like everyone else.

517
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:46,333
Your Honor, what is the relevance of this interrogation?

518
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,069
Denied. Continue.

519
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,672
Money is a vicious cycle.

520
00:32:51,672 --> 00:32:54,541
His company raises the price of oil by a few cents

521
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,010
and then says that it is not a monopoly.

522
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,481
After announcing that care about the environment

523
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:02,349
and that are not making money.

524
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:06,620
Only this year you earned $ 50 billion!

525
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,823
Money and greed, is not it?

526
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,760
Protest! Argumentative!

527
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,661
- Forged!
- Ambiguous.

528
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:18,432
What is the purpose, Mr. O'Brian, this questioning?

529
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:21,502
The purpose? Show the love of money

530
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,130
it is the root of all evil.

531
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:28,876
- Protest again!
- Sustained.

532
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:33,514
Promoter, enough personal attacks. You understand me?

533
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:36,449
Yes, Your Honor. Sorry.

534
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:45,025
Mr. Door, believe in God?

535
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,424
No.

536
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,489
Thank you."

537
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,332
Let's take a short recess.

538
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:53,767
Wow...

539
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:57,371
Tony, it seems that Luke O'Brien came on a roll this afternoon.

540
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:01,475
This guy amazes me. At a time is an idiot, and the following is a genius.

541
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:04,678
That's right. I've just been informed that they are following us on ...

542
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:08,649
more than 20 countries that broadcast this event around the world.

543
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:13,287
Even in Pakistan, Hungary, Chile, Bolivia, Iraq,

544
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:16,123
and believe it or not, Jasmine, in North Korea.

545
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:20,694
It is. This tells me that there is much at stake in this trial,

546
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:23,397
and my prayers are with Luke O'Brian.

547
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,766
And he will need much prayer.

548
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:28,394
We came back after the break.

549
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:32,864
This was a dirty trick,

550
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:37,711
cheap, rotten, Mr. O'Brian, and you know it.

551
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:40,681
My client has nothing to do with the oil industry.

552
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:44,585
Well, you can deny, but your client is Satan.

553
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,554
- Have you thought about it?
- You're finished!

554
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:48,922
When I am finished with you,

555
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:53,126
may not exercise the right or the Antarctic.

556
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:55,424
- Mint?
No, thank you.

557
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:06,699
"What happened?"

558
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:10,444
It's okay. Only a little threatened.

559
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,980
- Oh, you threatened?
-Yes.

560
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,643
I have a feeling we're missing.

561
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,913
Look, do not worry!

562
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,389
I never tell me not to worry!

563
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:26,052
It's good to finish it the next chance, okay?

564
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,920
You have not seen my bad side.

565
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:31,121
Stand-up

566
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:35,961
Your Honor, the defense called to testify Luke O'Brian.

567
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:39,328
- Why are you calling now?
- I can not imagine.

568
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:49,576
Mr. O'Brian,

569
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:54,180
know what it means audacity?

570
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:56,014
Yes.

571
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,792
"Great!

572
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:04,364
And do not think audacity to use the precious time of the jurors

573
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:07,663
ridiculous with your process?

574
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:11,838
No.

575
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,677
How can you sit there with this guy jerk

576
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:19,246
and not have an ounce of shame?

577
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:23,650
Protest! He is suppressing the witness.

578
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,888
Repressing the witness? What is this? I have never heard this kind of protest.

579
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:31,016
Learned that in the course of law by correspondence?

580
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,929
What comes next?

581
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:40,133
Protest, he is not using deodorant and smells bad now.

582
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:43,904
Protest, he called me a bad name and made me cry!

583
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,371
____Enough already!

584
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,644
No further questions, Your Honor.

585
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:53,875
Pass the word to my co-counsel. Thank you.

586
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:57,976
- How about these dirty tricks?
- Were not low enough.

587
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,617
And how far should we go?

588
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:06,256
As low as hell.

589
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:15,135
- Your Honor, we can make a withdrawal?
-Why?

590
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:17,170
I need to discuss something with my colleagues.

591
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,798
Be quick, two minutes.

592
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:26,646
Wow, it seems the jury is siding with Satan.

593
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:29,716
I do not know how he can sit there and catch the defense lawyers.

594
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:33,153
And why would Satan bother to defend himself?

595
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:37,324
Listen, you moron, he will not have a free time?

596
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:42,091
I know when someone is real or not, and he really is. He is Satan himself.

597
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:46,523
Never call me silly.

598
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,760
- Finish him.
Yes, sir.

599
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,711
I apologize for my co-counsel, Mr. O'Brian.

600
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:00,647
Sometimes he exaggerates a little.

601
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:04,777
A simple question, Mr. O'Brian. Do you believe in God?

602
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:07,254
Yes, I believe.

603
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:09,848
And believe in Satan?

604
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:11,925
But of course.

605
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:15,383
Likes Satan?

606
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:20,359
What a silly question is that? Why do I sue someone I like?

607
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:22,294
Order!

608
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,704
You're right.

609
00:38:24,704 --> 00:38:29,910
But do not think that is a lot of blaming?

610
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,479
Satan is behind everything.

611
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,747
Really?

612
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:36,550
I have in my hands a statement.

613
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,854
When her mother died, a nurse heard him say:

614
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:43,723
"God, how could you have let this happen to me?"

615
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:45,384
You said that?

616
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:47,590
What do you think?"

617
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:52,165
Not great, but a little better.

618
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:55,168
You are content with little, right?

619
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:58,660
I want this brat is destroyed.

620
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,111
He said that, Mr. O'Brien?

621
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:05,412
Yes, I said.

622
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:11,284
He said: "God, how could you have let this happen to me?"

623
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:13,548
Note that I emphasized the word you.

624
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:17,157
Yes, you're getting at?

625
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:21,116
You were not blaming God and Satan, right?

626
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:25,724
Order!

627
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:31,259
Order! I will not allow such disrespect in my court. Thank you.

628
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,940
No further questions, Your Honor.

629
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:42,482
Order!

630
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:44,017
Order!

631
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:45,252
Order!

632
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:50,490
If I hear that noise again, everyone must evacuate the cut, get it?

633
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,014
Mr. Wilson: Hi yes Id consider selling direct to you! The skirt is on its way & was posted so should reach you soon!! I will look up the delivery slip to see if I can see when it will be delivered & get back to you. Kindest Regards LOLITA J

634
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,860
Why did I get myself into this?

635
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:07,407
That lawyer was right today.

636
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,068
About what?

637
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,345
I blamed God ...

638
00:40:13,313 --> 00:40:15,110
the death of my mother.

639
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:19,085
Need not be blaming themselves for it.

640
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:23,886
So many people question God in this life.

641
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:26,224
Yeah, but he caught me at all.

642
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:30,897
God could easily prevent her death,

643
00:40:30,897 --> 00:40:32,421
but not avoided.

644
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:44,937
Your Honor, I call Satan to testify.

645
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:07,901
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

646
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,904
But this does not apply to me!

647
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:15,742
Are you saying that for religious reasons refuses to take the oath?

648
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:18,370
I'm not religious.

649
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:25,842
Admits to being Satan?

650
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:32,525
Do not admit anything, I see nothing, hear nothing.

651
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:36,196
He admits that is the evil being who chased Eve?

652
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:38,732
Protest. It is based on unproven facts.

653
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:41,234
It was not established that Satan is evil.

654
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:44,371
- And it's leading the witness, Your Honor.
- It is also irrelevant, Your Honor.

655
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:48,671
Protest denied. Now all feel.

656
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:54,414
I do not chase Eve, right?

657
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:56,883
In fact, she came to me.

658
00:41:56,883 --> 00:42:02,355
Just as you, Luke, again and again.

659
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:05,592
Sorry, but I never tried.

660
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:08,595
I think the scriptures are quite clear:

661
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:12,292
"He who loves this world is the enemy of God."

662
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:15,368
Think of all those who worked so hard at times

663
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:20,640
to buy video games instead of praying to God.

664
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,777
Now, come on. Admit the truth.

665
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:26,813
You came to me several times.

666
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:30,383
I want to talk about that October night in the hospital.

667
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:33,147
The night my mother was hit by a drunk driver.

668
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,456
____I do not remember...
- Shortly before she died,

669
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:40,093
- I knew you were there.
____I do not remember...

670
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:42,996
Do not you remember? Do not remember anything, right?

671
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:46,591
Now, I'm not dwelling on negative thoughts.

672
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:50,003
Or insignificant.

673
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:51,595
Negligible

674
00:42:52,172 --> 00:42:57,410
- My mother was not insignificant!
- Now I know what it is.

675
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,814
All this is because his mother died

676
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:04,150
before you tell her I loved her.

677
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,418
It is not true.

678
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:09,222
How he must have felt guilty for being a bad son.

679
00:43:09,222 --> 00:43:13,126
And that time you tore the Bible and threw it in the trash, huh?

680
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:18,264
As you were good. He showed it to her and God.

681
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,433
Stop, I'm saying.

682
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:23,103
- Oh, Luke!
- Stop talking about my mother!

683
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:27,507
She raised you so well and died so young, poor.

684
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:28,908
Safety
- I'll kill you!

685
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:31,378
Safety
- Do not talk about my mother!

686
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,813
I have not spoken of his mother!

687
00:43:33,813 --> 00:43:36,249
Look at this boy, Your Honor. Look at him.

688
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:38,318
Sounds like a Christian?

689
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,286
It seems to be a Christian to you?

690
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:41,855
- Mr. O'Brian!
- I'll kill you!

691
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:43,289
Do not talk about my mother!

692
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,813
- Order!
- Wide!

693
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:48,428
- Order!
- I did not tell his mother!

694
00:43:48,428 --> 00:43:51,231
- Mr. O'Brian!
- This is not a Christian.

695
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:53,967
- This man is a barbarian.
- Mr. O'Brian!

696
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,804
If you lose control again in this court, I'll have you arrested for contempt-Io.

697
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:00,073
Let go of me! Let go of me!

698
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:02,871
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Honor.

699
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:08,239
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

700
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,084
- It's okay.
- My mother was a saint.

701
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:13,075
Okay, apology accepted.

702
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,555
My mother was a saint.

703
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:18,091
I'm sure yes.

704
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:22,729
But is not my fault, is it? You can not blame me.

705
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,663
Think, Luke. Think.

706
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:27,257
No further questions.

707
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:31,438
- Let's take a short recess.
- Hey, boy! Luke!

708
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:33,565
A small recess!

709
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:46,352
Do not forget, we have to win the jury, okay?

710
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:51,289
This seems like a nightmare. I can not get out.

711
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,520
I..."

712
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,724
"Hey!

713
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:04,370
YOU DECIDE THE VERDICT WITH BARRY POLK

714
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:08,007
Well, well, well. What do you think that?

715
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:10,844
Well, if you want my opinion, Barry, this guy ...

716
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:14,211
have a screw loose in his head.

717
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:18,818
Yeah, but Satan convinced the jury that it was not responsible for the death of the mother of Mr. O'Brian.

718
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:22,021
Of course! The jerk blame everyone but himself.

719
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:24,390
It's pathetic. It's even worth looking at it.

720
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,025
Jasmine, any comments?

721
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:30,096
Why all this love for Satan? We are talking about Lucifer

722
00:45:30,096 --> 00:45:32,365
the monster that caused the downfall of all mankind,

723
00:45:32,365 --> 00:45:35,401
and you are finding great that Satan is winning. What is this?

724
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:38,605
Well, folks. Let's be civilized, we will maintain order.

725
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:41,641
First, that is not Satan.

726
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:43,939
You know how I know? I've seen Satan.

727
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:50,038
Wait, you saw Satan?

728
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:55,421
Okay, guys, sorry we can ...

729
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:58,625
I think the audience would like to stick to legal matters.

730
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:04,120
In short, Barry, Luke is weak, is no match for Satan.

731
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,730
Very well. What we do now?

732
00:46:10,036 --> 00:46:13,139
- Now the fight will heat up.
- That's what I want to hear.

733
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:18,478
That's what I want to hear. I want to play low, low, low.

734
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:21,447
I destroyed this guy.

735
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:26,146
The court is again in session. Promoter continue.

736
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:28,954
Promoter?

737
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:36,953
The prosecution called to testify Satan.

738
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:42,869
In the Bible, the Book of Job,

739
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:47,329
Job you attack both physically and spiritually. Why is that?

740
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:53,869
Finally an intelligent question in this court.

741
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:58,217
The short answer is:

742
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:01,015
Because I wanted to try Io.

743
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:04,357
And he passed his test?

744
00:47:04,357 --> 00:47:08,461
Yes, I know it's hard to believe, but he passed.

745
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:14,000
And that does not prove that you are responsible for the suffering of at least one person?

746
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,592
"Maybe.

747
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:21,841
So why can not be responsible for the suffering of the world?

748
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:25,044
Your Honor, I protest. Is leading the witness.

749
00:47:25,044 --> 00:47:28,207
Denied. The witness may answer the question.

750
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:32,418
See, I'm not omnipresent.

751
00:47:32,418 --> 00:47:36,022
I can not be in two places at once. Only God can.

752
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:39,192
God could stop me at any time, but did not.

753
00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:42,662
You should do these questions to him.

754
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:48,294
By the way, what does that say about the mighty up there?

755
00:47:48,501 --> 00:47:51,871
If he can prevent evil and does not,

756
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:54,669
what does that say about him?

757
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:58,945
I think this tells me that He gave free will to all.

758
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:02,548
Protest. She can not answer the questions of the witness.

759
00:48:02,548 --> 00:48:05,618
I agree. Please keep your opinions to yourself.

760
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:07,085
Of course, Your Honor.

761
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,221
"Any more questions?"

762
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:12,349
No.

763
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,421
Bailiff! Bailiff, do something!

764
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:28,274
Stay calm, please. How did ...

765
00:48:28,274 --> 00:48:31,072
Bailiff, take the court this thing!

766
00:48:34,113 --> 00:48:36,673
She must have entered by ventilation, Your Honor.

767
00:48:39,285 --> 00:48:41,082
Calm down everyone.

768
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,361
- What is your next move?
"Hey guys!"

769
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:50,530
need a little time, okay?

770
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,225
Just have to go to the bathroom.

771
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,226
Thank you."

772
00:49:05,478 --> 00:49:07,412
Waiting for?

773
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:09,375
Wait a few minutes.

774
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:11,975
I ate oysters spoiled.

775
00:49:12,852 --> 00:49:15,218
Why did you come to defend themselves?

776
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:18,254
Why did you want to sue me?

777
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:21,861
I did not think you'd show up.

778
00:49:21,861 --> 00:49:25,865
Do not think I'd show up? What else is saying stupid!

779
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:27,492
So why did he appear?

780
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:30,670
I am here to defend my honor.

781
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,872
His honor? You're a snake.

782
00:49:32,872 --> 00:49:37,443
Be careful, O'Brian. Can I sue you for libel.

783
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:40,580
The truth is a defense against libel.

784
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,183
Yes, of course. I forgot you know the law, is not it?

785
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:47,787
Okay. Call me a snake.

786
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:52,019
Actually, I like snakes. Have you eaten?

787
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:57,296
You know, I can not understand is why he turned against God.

788
00:49:57,296 --> 00:50:00,533
You were the leader of worship, was a beautiful angel,

789
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:03,603
- And threw it all away.
- I did not throw anything away.

790
00:50:03,603 --> 00:50:05,505
Actually, you know,

791
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:07,707
I am very attractive, is not it?

792
00:50:07,707 --> 00:50:11,444
Listen, I like to just talk in the past,

793
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:14,140
but if you want a direct answer,

794
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:17,807
I thought I ...

795
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:20,342
be God.

796
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,189
What a mistake.

797
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:26,125
Still not finished, buddy.

798
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:29,228
And now wants revenge on humans?

799
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:33,166
I want to ask you something. Why are not you afraid?

800
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,934
Fear? Fear of what?

801
00:50:34,934 --> 00:50:39,105
Now, I was in who made Jesus Christ was crucified.

802
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:42,008
Think about that!
- Oh, you think!

803
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:44,677
You see, Jesus gave himself on the cross

804
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:48,748
and that was the biggest mistake of his life, "buddy."

805
00:50:48,748 --> 00:50:52,741
Remember the Garden of Gethsemane?

806
00:50:53,286 --> 00:50:58,246
All the disciples fell asleep and he had no one to turn to.

807
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:03,796
Yet he was until the end is unbelievable!

808
00:51:03,796 --> 00:51:08,234
Yes, what a great man! That's why I owe so much to him.

809
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:12,872
Listen, you moron. You will lose this case,

810
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:15,708
will be the laughing stock of the world.

811
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:17,710
Even children will point at you and say:

812
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,146
"That's not the idiot who tried to sue Satan?"

813
00:51:23,816 --> 00:51:26,719
Listen, do not talk to this idiot without my presence.

814
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,187
Do not do this, please.

815
00:51:28,187 --> 00:51:32,124
- Everything is under control, Mr. Banks?
- Of course it is.

816
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:34,558
Remember that we do not lose ever.

817
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:40,165
Great. Do not ever say that to me.

818
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,304
Have a nice day.

819
00:51:50,943 --> 00:51:52,979
Would it be correct to say that ...

820
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:57,814
you left school because they do not stand the pressure?

821
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:00,620
Yes.

822
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:04,657
And that was the fault of Satan?

823
00:52:04,657 --> 00:52:06,893
No, it was mine.

824
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:08,694
- Was his.
-Yes.

825
00:52:08,694 --> 00:52:12,131
And is currently studying at ...

826
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:14,934
Doctor, please do not put your hand on the witness.

827
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:18,271
Sorry, Your Honor. He reminds me of my son.

828
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:19,238
So:

829
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:25,768
How can we compare the night course Billy's right to other universities?

830
00:52:26,946 --> 00:52:28,345
How do I know?

831
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:33,085
Well, I graduated in law from Harvard. As can be compared to yours?

832
00:52:33,085 --> 00:52:34,887
Protest!

833
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:37,390
Is protesting against his own lawyer?

834
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,160
Your Honor, I would turn to my lawyer if possible.

835
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,027
Please come here.

836
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:48,100
How dare you ridicule this man in front of everyone?

837
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,671
- Just wanted to show that ...
- So what if it is Harvard?

838
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:56,876
Big deal! Nobody cares! Listen, I'm the boss, not you.

839
00:52:56,876 --> 00:53:00,746
We are here to represent the man there. It's not your show.

840
00:53:00,746 --> 00:53:02,748
You know what? Go away!

841
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:04,511
What?"
- You're fired!

842
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:13,626
Your Honor, excuse my outburst, I'm sorry.

843
00:53:13,626 --> 00:53:17,730
With the permission of the court, I'd like to replace the co-champion Iowa.

844
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,967
- The lovely Miss. Scarlett.
- Replacement accepted.

845
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:23,697
Thank you!
- Proceed with the questioning, please.

846
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:32,510
Good trick.

847
00:53:33,012 --> 00:53:35,412
You have not seen anything.

848
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:39,785
We are losing the cause, Luke. Have you noticed that?

849
00:53:39,785 --> 00:53:41,887
Yes, I noticed.

850
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:45,345
I can not believe the jury is on the side of Satan.

851
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:49,195
Wow, my name will be cited as the worst lawyer in history.

852
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:51,564
Luke, it is misleading to the jury.

853
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:53,265
It is the same.

854
00:53:53,265 --> 00:53:56,135
I know that. He even fooled me.

855
00:53:56,135 --> 00:53:58,160
____What can I do?

856
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:01,841
I asked: "Are you okay?"
- Yes, I'm fine.

857
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:03,175
- Are you sure?
-Yes.

858
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:06,872
- Are you ready to act in the way of the Lord?
- The way of the Lord?

859
00:54:07,613 --> 00:54:11,450
I thought I was doing it. I am suing the devil, if you have not noticed.

860
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,652
For whose glory? His or his?

861
00:54:13,652 --> 00:54:18,055
Honey, it's a little more complicated than that. You do not understand.

862
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:21,160
You know, the funny thing is that most people

863
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,597
lock a spiritual battle every day of their lives

864
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:29,402
and continue to live their lives without thinking about what God wants for them.

865
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:31,170
What do you mean?

866
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,841
I want to say that Satan does not care for those who are too busy for God.

867
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:39,242
Only care about those who are too busy to Satan.

868
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,505
Hello!
- Are you going to testify today?

869
00:54:44,183 --> 00:54:46,852
Just want to say that this is my statement:

870
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:51,857
The trial became a battle of good against evil.

871
00:54:51,857 --> 00:54:55,895
I have nothing personal against Mr. Luke O'Brien,

872
00:54:55,895 --> 00:54:58,964
it is a wrong with the Bible, that's all.

873
00:54:58,964 --> 00:55:02,127
Even so, it will be an interesting battle. Thank you.

874
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:06,105
You have 8 trillion in the bank in case you lose?

875
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:07,907
Why? Need a loan?

876
00:55:07,907 --> 00:55:10,109
Mr. Satan, can you tell us what hell is like?

877
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:13,738
I can. It is very hot. Want to go there to see?

878
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:16,181
If it is Satan, then prove it.

879
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:21,552
What happened to him?

880
00:55:37,937 --> 00:55:39,529
THE END OF THE WORLD

881
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:45,544
Hey, blind man,

882
00:55:45,544 --> 00:55:48,013
really think the end is near?

883
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:51,505
I believe that Jesus will return soon, yes.

884
00:55:51,984 --> 00:55:56,021
- And why is that?
- I am blind, but I can see.

885
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:59,125
The book of Luke says, "Be careful not to be deceived.

886
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:01,961
For many virãoo in my name, saying, 'I am! '

887
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:04,897
- Yes, I know. Thank you.
- 'This Time' pro'ximo '.

888
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:10,202
He said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

889
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:14,874
There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places. "

890
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:19,311
I really believe that we are the generation úItima.

891
00:56:27,653 --> 00:56:31,724
Congratulations. It sounds like it will be a cakewalk.

892
00:56:31,724 --> 00:56:34,393
It is even a breeze?

893
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:37,596
- Something wrong?
- No, no.

894
00:56:37,596 --> 00:56:41,634
Remember that blind out there?

895
00:56:41,634 --> 00:56:45,004
- Blind?
- It is. Where will he go?

896
00:56:45,004 --> 00:56:47,907
We tie the jury.

897
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:51,510
This case is won if we do not spoil everything.

898
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,138
- We bind all, huh?
- Tied.

899
00:56:55,147 --> 00:56:56,649
You know?

900
00:56:56,649 --> 00:56:59,485
I think we have to change the strategy.

901
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:01,419
Stand-up

902
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:18,228
Can you explain evil?

903
00:57:19,638 --> 00:57:21,367
Did you hear my question?

904
00:57:21,974 --> 00:57:23,032
Yes.

905
00:57:24,076 --> 00:57:25,338
So:

906
00:57:26,378 --> 00:57:29,677
Evil is good.

907
00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:34,809
Are you saying that evil is good?

908
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:38,157
You still do not understand, is not it?

909
00:57:38,157 --> 00:57:40,626
There would be no good without evil

910
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:44,163
and hence no evil without good.

911
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:45,798
So Ezekiel ...

912
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:47,533
- Ezekiel?
-Yes.

913
00:57:47,533 --> 00:57:50,102
- One of my favorites.
"Oh, yes.

914
00:57:50,102 --> 00:57:53,239
He said a beautiful thing about you. Say you were a leader of worship,

915
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:55,808
anointed as a guardian cherub,

916
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:59,445
you were on the holy mountain of God,

917
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:02,548
- And walked among the fiery stones.
- Sparkling stones.

918
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:04,850
- Sparkling stones.
-Yes.

919
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,518
-Yes.
So what?

920
00:58:06,518 --> 00:58:09,321
So what? So you thought like God,

921
00:58:09,321 --> 00:58:12,313
and that was a silly, right?

922
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:17,463
What kind of question is that, Your Honor?

923
00:58:17,463 --> 00:58:18,657
Your Honor!

924
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:22,668
- Who is Jesus to you?
- What?

925
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:25,704
I said: Who is Jesus Christ?

926
00:58:25,704 --> 00:58:27,973
Your Honor, what does this have to do with it?

927
00:58:27,973 --> 00:58:29,742
Objection, Your Honor.

928
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:33,412
- Where do you want to go with it?
- Denied. Continue.

929
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:34,713
Your Honor, please.

930
00:58:34,713 --> 00:58:38,350
Would you please sit down and be quiet?

931
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,544
Got it?

932
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,746
Thank you, doctor.

933
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:46,082
Who is Jesus Christ?

934
00:58:49,962 --> 00:58:52,226
Witness, answer the question.

935
00:58:52,765 --> 00:58:53,925
Yes, Your Honor.

936
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:56,030
Jesus Christ.

937
00:58:56,802 --> 00:58:57,826
She's OK.

938
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:02,641
He was a good teacher, that's all. Nothing more.

939
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:06,445
It was a good teacher? I do not remember him saying anything.

940
00:59:06,445 --> 00:59:08,981
Okay, he said he was God.

941
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:12,284
- Sorry, what did he say?
- Great stuff!

942
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:13,552
You heard me.

943
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:17,283
He said that was what? Sorry, but you can repeat to the jury and the court?

944
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,625
Have not you heard?

945
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:23,962
I will not repeat. If you have wax in your ears, go clean.

946
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:28,922
But the worst mistake of his life was crucify Io, was not it?

947
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:31,637
It's good to take care of that speech, boy.

948
00:59:31,637 --> 00:59:34,197
He thought he had thought of everything, right?

949
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:39,906
Be careful what you say, boy.

950
00:59:42,514 --> 00:59:46,473
Look around you. What do you see?

951
01:00:02,868 --> 01:00:07,931
I've looked at. Why do not you look now? What do you see?

952
01:00:16,315 --> 01:00:17,950
Who are you?

953
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,886
I am a believer in Jesus Christ

954
01:00:20,886 --> 01:00:23,980
and love God. That's all I have to be.

955
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:28,482
Excuse me, Mr. O'Brian. Any more questions?

956
01:00:28,794 --> 01:00:33,732
Wow! Here we are, another round of events. What do you think?

957
01:00:33,732 --> 01:00:37,532
I think I never will see such a thing in our lives.

958
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,469
"What happened?"

959
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,534
This loser!

960
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:47,802
Okay, let's fight. From now on, it's war.

961
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:57,982
Where did this come from?

962
01:00:58,957 --> 01:01:00,322
I don't know.

963
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:02,986
It was like ...

964
01:01:04,163 --> 01:01:05,528
He waits a little...)

965
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:10,325
"Hey!

966
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:15,107
I asked: "Are you okay?"
-Yes.

967
01:01:15,107 --> 01:01:17,075
I'm just a headache.

968
01:01:18,143 --> 01:01:19,542
Don't worry.

969
01:01:24,783 --> 01:01:27,650
Silence in court. All rise.

970
01:01:28,787 --> 01:01:30,721
The court is in session.

971
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,880
You may be seated.

972
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:36,325
Let me make one thing clear.

973
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:41,066
Do not want to cry in court.

974
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:42,761
Understood?

975
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:45,662
Great. Can proceed.

976
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:54,038
Mr. O'Brian, has seen pornography on the internet?

977
01:01:57,783 --> 01:02:00,581
-Yes.
- How many times?

978
01:02:03,355 --> 01:02:05,023
I don't know.

979
01:02:05,023 --> 01:02:05,923
How about 341 times?

980
01:02:10,362 --> 01:02:12,865
- It would be a precise number?
- Objection!

981
01:02:12,865 --> 01:02:14,600
Your Honor, this is irrelevant.

982
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,400
- Irrelevant? I think not.
- Denied. Continue.

983
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:21,600
Maybe that's the number.

984
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:25,444
But not after I got married.

985
01:02:25,444 --> 01:02:30,048
And during that period, there were wars in Afghanistan,

986
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:33,252
Somalia, Iraq,

987
01:02:33,252 --> 01:02:37,356
children were killed, a boy lost his mother.

988
01:02:37,356 --> 01:02:40,392
Excuse me. Where are getting at?

989
01:02:40,392 --> 01:02:45,230
I just want to know if Mr. O'Brien knew of these events.

990
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,332
Yes, I know.

991
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:52,170
So tell me. Why you chose Satan

992
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:54,934
instead of the other events?

993
01:02:57,142 --> 01:02:59,478
Well, he probably did not choose.

994
01:02:59,478 --> 01:03:01,070
____It was my fault!

995
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,318
My and my carnal desires.

996
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:10,589
So Satan is not to blame for his carnal desires?

997
01:03:10,589 --> 01:03:11,920
No.

998
01:03:12,558 --> 01:03:16,824
We have to work out our salvation every day. Day by day.

999
01:03:23,502 --> 01:03:25,970
How they got that information, Luke?

1000
01:03:27,439 --> 01:03:28,974
I don't know.

1001
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:33,138
Gwen knew the story of the internet?

1002
01:03:37,382 --> 01:03:38,684
No.

1003
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:42,245
- Luke, I'm sorry.
- Look, give me a minute, okay?

1004
01:03:42,955 --> 01:03:44,445
I'm fine.

1005
01:03:45,057 --> 01:03:46,692
Luke,

1006
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:49,525
you think this man is really Satan?

1007
01:03:50,696 --> 01:03:54,063
The session is reopened. Witness to testify again, please.

1008
01:03:57,703 --> 01:03:59,466
Sorry. Yes, Your Honor.

1009
01:04:05,444 --> 01:04:11,550
Mr. O'Brien, you said or not said a word

1010
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,318
when someone off in traffic last week?

1011
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:16,088
Protest! This is just a guess, Your Honor.

1012
01:04:16,088 --> 01:04:18,557
Where did you get this information?

1013
01:04:18,557 --> 01:04:21,727
We have a recording, we can show the jury.

1014
01:04:21,727 --> 01:04:23,462
And who was in the car to save it?

1015
01:04:23,462 --> 01:04:27,866
Your Honor, as we present this as proof.

1016
01:04:27,866 --> 01:04:32,604
We received a phone recording of Mr. O'Brian.

1017
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:33,739
Say what?

1018
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:36,775
Some phones transmit such recordings

1019
01:04:36,775 --> 01:04:41,747
and that is why we have the recording of the cell of Mr. O'Brian.

1020
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:44,216
We have already presented as evidence.

1021
01:04:44,216 --> 01:04:46,818
Yes, right here.

1022
01:04:46,818 --> 01:04:49,286
That's odd. Continue.

1023
01:04:50,188 --> 01:04:53,325
- You said ...
- Yes! Yes, I said.

1024
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:58,063
- That fellow I shut ...
- Yes or no, Mr. O'Brien?

1025
01:04:58,063 --> 01:04:59,431
Yes.

1026
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:04,664
And you made a racist comment last week?

1027
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,803
Yes.

1028
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:13,378
- What do you say?
____I do not remember...

1029
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:15,539
And when did it become a Christian?

1030
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:20,919
I accepted Jesus Christ in my heart for 7 years.

1031
01:05:20,919 --> 01:05:23,121
7 years old:

1032
01:05:23,121 --> 01:05:27,114
And swears and makes racist comments.

1033
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:31,385
No further questions.

1034
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,399
Mr. O'Brian, other racist comments that you said?

1035
01:05:34,399 --> 01:05:38,203
- Are you racist?
- He is a member of the Ku Klux Klan?

1036
01:05:38,203 --> 01:05:40,972
What kind of man you are? If you think even a Christian?

1037
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:42,441
Please excuse me now.

1038
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,705
How does it feel to see what's missing?

1039
01:05:45,744 --> 01:05:47,268
It is true that going to divorce?

1040
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:52,317
Have you felt so down ...

1041
01:05:52,317 --> 01:05:55,654
he no longer has to turn to except to heaven?

1042
01:05:55,654 --> 01:05:57,485
Lord God,

1043
01:05:58,724 --> 01:06:02,216
I acknowledge that I have blamed everyone but me.

1044
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:07,599
I even blame Satan, but did not see my own shortcomings,

1045
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,068
my own flesh.

1046
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:12,971
Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me.

1047
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:15,872
Because of all the people of this land,

1048
01:06:16,374 --> 01:06:19,366
I am the biggest hypocrite

1049
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:22,013
and the worst sinner.

1050
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:29,121
Give me another chance to do the right thing the right way,

1051
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:31,885
of Thy way, Thy will.

1052
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:35,152
I want to win this cause.

1053
01:06:39,598 --> 01:06:43,735
Barry, most experts agree that this case is lost.

1054
01:06:43,735 --> 01:06:47,272
Luke O'Brien lost the jury and lost the case.

1055
01:06:47,272 --> 01:06:50,142
Amazing. Then his past came to torment Io.

1056
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:51,777
Yes, that's right.

1057
01:06:51,777 --> 01:06:54,012
Now let's talk to Mark, live in London.

1058
01:06:54,012 --> 01:06:57,675
Mark, what is the consensus among people here in England?

1059
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:03,622
Barry, most people I talked to agree that Luke O'Brien is a hypocrite.

1060
01:07:03,622 --> 01:07:07,217
He is suing the devil when he should sue himself.

1061
01:07:13,932 --> 01:07:16,768
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth

1062
01:07:16,768 --> 01:07:20,505
with the power of the Holy Spirit to do good

1063
01:07:20,505 --> 01:07:24,042
and healing all who were under the dominion of the devil,

1064
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:25,066
that ...

1065
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:29,414
- What does this mean to you?
- Wow, you're amazing.

1066
01:07:29,414 --> 01:07:32,781
He spoke this mantra all day, is not it?

1067
01:07:34,553 --> 01:07:36,454
What does this mean for me?

1068
01:07:36,454 --> 01:07:40,754
Absolutely nothing. At all.

1069
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:48,166
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

1070
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:53,263
I'll tell you one thing. I wanted to have the power to make you disappear.

1071
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:56,664
You're too boring!

1072
01:07:57,175 --> 01:08:01,441
And Jesus was referring to you, then I ask:

1073
01:08:02,581 --> 01:08:05,617
How many people have you killed?

1074
01:08:05,617 --> 01:08:07,319
Objection, Your Honor.

1075
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:10,155
He continues assuming the Bible as evidence.

1076
01:08:10,155 --> 01:08:13,992
We all know that is a lot of fairy tales, is it?

1077
01:08:13,992 --> 01:08:16,962
I ask that the entire line of argument is deleted from the file.

1078
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:19,965
Denied. And by the way, Mr. Banks,

1079
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:22,701
his commentary on the Bible is wrong.

1080
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:26,137
Do you have any proof of his statement about "fairy tales"?

1081
01:08:26,671 --> 01:08:29,507
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Are they deaf?

1082
01:08:29,507 --> 01:08:31,998
Sit down, all of you!

1083
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:39,651
According to the Bible, I killed ten people.

1084
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:41,586
The family of Job, that's all.

1085
01:08:41,586 --> 01:08:44,122
But how many people God killed in the flood?

1086
01:08:44,122 --> 01:08:47,492
It is estimated that 100 million people were!

1087
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:51,096
- Why not tell the truth?
- Want the truth?

1088
01:08:51,096 --> 01:08:54,122
You can not handle the truth!

1089
01:08:55,901 --> 01:08:57,502
Order!

1090
01:08:57,502 --> 01:09:00,027
I can handle the truth.

1091
01:09:03,174 --> 01:09:06,344
You know, Jesus said:

1092
01:09:06,344 --> 01:09:10,872
"I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."

1093
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:16,321
He also said: "I am the good shepherd.

1094
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:19,882
The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. "

1095
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:23,895
So I ask:

1096
01:09:23,895 --> 01:09:28,800
Would you give your life for a human being, as Jesus did?

1097
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,700
"Of course not.

1098
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,438
Humans are garbage.

1099
01:09:33,438 --> 01:09:35,963
I'm just the garbage collector.

1100
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:40,612
- Well put, Satan.
- Your Honor, I think we can not ...

1101
01:09:40,612 --> 01:09:42,647
____Sit!

1102
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:46,418
Why get so nervous when I mention the name of Jesus Christ?

1103
01:09:46,418 --> 01:09:49,421
Why do not you ask me something fun, like death?

1104
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:52,290
- Ask about the death, come on!
- Want to talk about death?

1105
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:56,027
- Let's talk about death.
- How many people think are going to hell?

1106
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:58,029
I do not know. You know best. Say.

1107
01:09:58,029 --> 01:10:01,833
Over two billion people, according to the book of Revelation.

1108
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:05,070
- What about that?
- That man is evil,

1109
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:08,206
God is just, and you have part in the guilt.

1110
01:10:08,206 --> 01:10:12,010
Oh, I know. Been in hell, boy?

1111
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,945
It's not a fun place.

1112
01:10:13,945 --> 01:10:16,781
No. That's a shame, huh?

1113
01:10:16,781 --> 01:10:19,011
Because that's where you go.

1114
01:10:25,991 --> 01:10:27,151
Order!

1115
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:29,859
We will have a recess of 15 minutes.

1116
01:10:39,537 --> 01:10:42,335
- That was amazing.
is

1117
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,702
Now what?

1118
01:10:46,444 --> 01:10:49,140
- We need more witnesses.
ok

1119
01:10:50,148 --> 01:10:51,376
She's OK.

1120
01:10:54,853 --> 01:10:56,445
Pastor Pringle,

1121
01:10:57,689 --> 01:10:59,486
everything is God's fault?

1122
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:02,827
No, not his fault.

1123
01:11:02,827 --> 01:11:06,998
He is the creator of all things.

1124
01:11:06,998 --> 01:11:09,434
However he gave us free will

1125
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:12,926
that we should be free to choose.

1126
01:11:13,571 --> 01:11:14,873
It's just.

1127
01:11:14,873 --> 01:11:17,034
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

1128
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:23,648
- Pastor Pringle, right?
ok

1129
01:11:23,648 --> 01:11:29,177
Let me get this straight. You said that God gives us free will

1130
01:11:30,755 --> 01:11:34,125
that every man can choose between Satan and God.

1131
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:37,495
ok
- So if I go now to Mr. O'Brian

1132
01:11:37,495 --> 01:11:41,431
and throws a punch at his face, this is my free will?

1133
01:11:43,301 --> 01:11:45,970
ok
Very good!

1134
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:50,875
So is not the fault of Satan if we follow this line of reasoning.

1135
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:55,080
Well, Satan came to kill, steal and destroy.

1136
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:00,018
It is clear from Scripture that he is behind all the world's problems.

1137
01:12:00,018 --> 01:12:06,014
However, we become responsible for our actions when we fall into temptation.

1138
01:12:07,258 --> 01:12:08,555
Thank you."

1139
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:14,489
Pastor Philips,

1140
01:12:15,633 --> 01:12:20,271
can prove to me in 30 seconds or less that God exists?

1141
01:12:20,271 --> 01:12:22,674
- Objection!
- Denied.

1142
01:12:22,674 --> 01:12:24,476
The witness can answer.

1143
01:12:24,476 --> 01:12:28,513
30 seconds to prove that God exists? Can I do this in a sentence.

1144
01:12:28,513 --> 01:12:32,210
Something can not come from nothing is impossible.

1145
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:36,848
Very well. Something can not come from nowhere. How so?

1146
01:12:37,622 --> 01:12:42,460
We can explain where life began, where thoughts began to explain,

1147
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,163
but can not prove the moral conscience.

1148
01:12:45,163 --> 01:12:47,899
This is leaving scientists puzzled

1149
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:50,697
and also proves the existence of God.

1150
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:56,541
- And what is the mission of Satan?
- I think it is clear from Scripture.

1151
01:12:56,541 --> 01:13:00,678
He came to steal, kill and destroy.

1152
01:13:00,678 --> 01:13:03,014
- Is there a hell?
Absolutely!

1153
01:13:03,014 --> 01:13:07,318
And every day people have the opportunity to choose heaven or hell.

1154
01:13:07,318 --> 01:13:08,717
Thank you."

1155
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:13,658
Do you think that Satan is guilty of 8 trillion dollars?

1156
01:13:13,658 --> 01:13:17,253
- Objection!
- Denied. Answer the question.

1157
01:13:18,296 --> 01:13:20,798
You can not put a price on the damage he did,

1158
01:13:20,798 --> 01:13:23,995
but humans are responsible for their own souls.

1159
01:13:24,936 --> 01:13:26,563
Thank you, pastor. That's all.

1160
01:13:28,306 --> 01:13:32,710
That's right, folks. The case is a back and forth like a game of ping-pong.

1161
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:35,046
Tony, who is winning?

1162
01:13:35,046 --> 01:13:37,148
It's hard to tell, even if difficult,

1163
01:13:37,148 --> 01:13:41,152
but it was brilliant of him to bring different people to testify.

1164
01:13:41,152 --> 01:13:46,157
I would say that O'Brian is winning right now,

1165
01:13:46,157 --> 01:13:48,826
and he seems able to take the case to the end.

1166
01:13:48,826 --> 01:13:52,922
I think so. The jury is now supporting O'Brian.

1167
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:58,169
- I'm a little worried, sir.
"A little."

1168
01:13:58,169 --> 01:14:02,106
Gentlemen, we are losing this cause. We need to change the methods ...

1169
01:14:02,106 --> 01:14:04,939
Who do you think you're talking?

1170
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:09,747
You think as much, no? Just because you studied law at Stanford, is not it?

1171
01:14:09,747 --> 01:14:13,451
Work in a large firm? Only you know nothing, man.

1172
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:15,578
And that goes for you too!

1173
01:14:16,354 --> 01:14:18,990
Listen, you better win this case, I'm warning you,

1174
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:21,859
or my highest priority will pursue you day and night

1175
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:25,522
this world and in hell, right? Now get out of here! Get out!

1176
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:32,166
Never get tired of playing the bully?

1177
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:36,941
You know, I still do not understand you and your wife, after all ...

1178
01:14:36,941 --> 01:14:41,746
or you are super super crazy or stupid to want to fight me.

1179
01:14:41,746 --> 01:14:44,148
I'm not afraid of you.

1180
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:47,051
Yes, you can be more powerful than I on this earth,

1181
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:50,255
but Jesus is infinitely more powerful than you.

1182
01:14:50,255 --> 01:14:52,590
Is quoting the Bible again, is not it?

1183
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:57,721
I know, I know. So why not ask God to cure cancer in the brain of Gwen?

1184
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:05,635
What?"
Oh,

1185
01:15:06,504 --> 01:15:09,207
She did not tell you? Wow.

1186
01:15:09,207 --> 01:15:13,611
What a pity. Well, she has brain cancer.

1187
01:15:13,611 --> 01:15:16,341
She only got 5 months of life.

1188
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:20,051
- You're lying.
- Oh, yeah, I'm lying.

1189
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:23,621
I know, after all Satan ... He always lies, is not it?

1190
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:28,217
Well then why you did not ask her?

1191
01:15:41,572 --> 01:15:44,676
Everyone needs compassion,

1192
01:15:44,676 --> 01:15:48,043
a love that never fails.

1193
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:54,613
- Gwen, I must ask you something.
What?"

1194
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,481
And you have to be honest with me, okay?

1195
01:16:01,926 --> 01:16:03,723
Are you ill, dear?

1196
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:11,695
____I need to know!

1197
01:16:16,307 --> 01:16:18,366
You're dying of cancer?

1198
01:16:23,815 --> 01:16:25,680
____Why do not you tell me?

1199
01:16:27,118 --> 01:16:28,449
Sorry.

1200
01:16:30,455 --> 01:16:33,356
You were so busy.

1201
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:38,519
You know what? I want to continue the trial, all right?

1202
01:16:39,697 --> 01:16:41,799
I want you to win!

1203
01:16:41,799 --> 01:16:44,063
Are you listening? I want you to win!

1204
01:16:47,472 --> 01:16:48,871
____I love you!

1205
01:16:51,909 --> 01:16:53,240
Oh, dear,

1206
01:16:53,945 --> 01:16:55,742
I love you too much.

1207
01:17:01,252 --> 01:17:02,913
Stand-up

1208
01:17:06,524 --> 01:17:08,082
You may be seated.

1209
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,331
The defense has something to say?

1210
01:17:13,331 --> 01:17:16,868
Your Honor, we ask the court to grant us a delay

1211
01:17:16,868 --> 01:17:19,860
and suspend this trial immediately.

1212
01:17:21,072 --> 01:17:22,266
Order!

1213
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,709
Doctor, on what basis?

1214
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:28,475
Your Honor, this man is not Satan.

1215
01:17:30,915 --> 01:17:32,617
Order!

1216
01:17:32,617 --> 01:17:35,887
Doctor, you understand what you're saying?

1217
01:17:35,887 --> 01:17:40,158
The fact that he admitted to be Satan is unmistakable.

1218
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:46,731
Your Honor, according to international law, section 666,

1219
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:50,368
the trial can not continue if there is doubt as to the identity.

1220
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:53,404
Section 666? Never heard of her.

1221
01:17:53,404 --> 01:17:56,862
It's in your book. Page 341.

1222
01:18:00,611 --> 01:18:04,172
666. Here you are.

1223
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,885
Prosecuting attorney, any comments?

1224
01:18:07,885 --> 01:18:11,589
Your Honor, it was established that he is Satan.

1225
01:18:11,589 --> 01:18:14,892
No, it was established, Your Honor.

1226
01:18:14,892 --> 01:18:17,595
Especially in the light of new revelations about our client.

1227
01:18:17,595 --> 01:18:20,465
Oh! Let's stop.

1228
01:18:20,465 --> 01:18:23,696
Doctors want to see everyone in my room now.

1229
01:18:27,672 --> 01:18:29,440
This is absurd!

1230
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,075
Can I revoke your license for this!

1231
01:18:31,075 --> 01:18:34,579
Your Honor, we were alerted to the fact that our client is who it says it.

1232
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:36,314
- He is not Satan!
____What are you saying?

1233
01:18:36,314 --> 01:18:40,284
He's crazy. We represent deftly

1234
01:18:40,284 --> 01:18:41,953
and he tricked us.

1235
01:18:41,953 --> 01:18:44,689
Oh, he cheated, he cheated?

1236
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:47,959
You are not the best law firm in the world?

1237
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:51,262
- He also tricked them to pay?
- Your Honor, he's not crazy.

1238
01:18:51,262 --> 01:18:52,997
I judge it, thanks.

1239
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:56,567
We ask that the entire case is dismissed for lack of person.

1240
01:18:56,567 --> 01:19:00,304
- And under international law ... 393
- Will not quote the law!

1241
01:19:00,304 --> 01:19:05,109
This case will continue, but demand appears to be proof of identity.

1242
01:19:05,109 --> 01:19:08,079
You will have to prove that man is Satan.

1243
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:10,014
- Your Honor, it does not ...
- Oh, stop it,

1244
01:19:10,014 --> 01:19:12,049
- And all come back to court.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1245
01:19:12,049 --> 01:19:13,983
Good luck to you.

1246
01:19:21,592 --> 01:19:23,861
If you won or not,

1247
01:19:23,861 --> 01:19:25,796
you defended what he believed

1248
01:19:25,796 --> 01:19:28,799
and faced all that public humiliation.

1249
01:19:28,799 --> 01:19:31,168
You never gave up.

1250
01:19:31,168 --> 01:19:33,762
I respect that very much.

1251
01:19:35,907 --> 01:19:37,575
Thanks, I ...

1252
01:19:37,575 --> 01:19:40,635
I wish there was a way to prove this guy is the devil.

1253
01:19:41,045 --> 01:19:42,376
It is.

1254
01:19:45,249 --> 01:19:46,341
I asked: "Are you okay?"

1255
01:19:46,717 --> 01:19:49,185
- I'm fine.
Mr. Wilson: Hi yes Id consider selling direct to you! TShe skirt is on its way & was posted so should reach you soon!! I will look up tShe delivery slip to see if I can see wShen it will be delivered & get back to you. Kindest Regards LOLITA J

1256
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:57,461
How are you?
- Okay, how about you?

1257
01:19:57,461 --> 01:19:58,860
I'm fine.

1258
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:02,390
I thought I had caught that guy, you know?

1259
01:20:02,967 --> 01:20:05,333
He is too smart.

1260
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:10,334
You are dealing with a power beyond his comprehension.

1261
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:14,238
Luke, God is still in control.

1262
01:20:15,246 --> 01:20:17,237
Yeah, I feel that ...

1263
01:20:18,182 --> 01:20:19,750
What did you say?

1264
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:23,686
God is in control, Luke. God is in control.

1265
01:20:24,755 --> 01:20:27,692
- Remember this.
____I love you!

1266
01:20:27,692 --> 01:20:29,182
____I love you!

1267
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:32,185
Is that OK?"

1268
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:42,165
Your Honor, the prosecution would like to bring Satan to testify.

1269
01:20:57,188 --> 01:20:58,416
"Hi,

1270
01:20:58,823 --> 01:21:00,085
"Hi,

1271
01:21:01,225 --> 01:21:05,753
Why did the court and this jury that you were Satan?

1272
01:21:07,431 --> 01:21:10,034
In fact, if I remember correctly,

1273
01:21:10,034 --> 01:21:13,471
I never said I was Satan, who said it was you.

1274
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:16,307
You answered all the questions like Satan.

1275
01:21:16,307 --> 01:21:20,437
Well, someone had to defend Io, and that someone could be me, right?

1276
01:21:21,345 --> 01:21:22,573
Order!

1277
01:21:23,347 --> 01:21:25,149
As you make a living?

1278
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:27,985
I sell used cars, and new ones as well, is.

1279
01:21:27,985 --> 01:21:29,920
Come see me, I make a special price.

1280
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,355
Really?

1281
01:21:31,355 --> 01:21:33,724
For all of you a special precinho.

1282
01:21:33,724 --> 01:21:36,494
How about that, folks? But that cute.

1283
01:21:36,494 --> 01:21:38,596
It's all just a big joke to you, is not it?

1284
01:21:38,596 --> 01:21:42,733
Now, come on, we all had fun, right? I mean,

1285
01:21:42,733 --> 01:21:45,136
I had my 15 minutes, you had her,

1286
01:21:45,136 --> 01:21:48,372
all go home happy and satisfied, right?

1287
01:21:48,372 --> 01:21:52,343
After all, why did not you sued Satan?

1288
01:21:52,343 --> 01:21:53,640
No.

1289
01:21:54,345 --> 01:21:57,178
You're a rational person, is not it?

1290
01:21:58,582 --> 01:22:01,949
Yes you?

1291
01:22:04,555 --> 01:22:07,786
You would not do anything unusual in this court, would you?

1292
01:22:08,459 --> 01:22:11,553
There is nothing that is common in this court.

1293
01:22:12,997 --> 01:22:14,294
Order!

1294
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:17,068
- Sorry, Your Honor.
- I meant ...

1295
01:22:17,068 --> 01:22:20,604
now that you turned out to be a car salesman ...

1296
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:21,672
"Right, right.

1297
01:22:21,672 --> 01:22:24,971
You would not do anything crazy, would you?

1298
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,479
- I think not.
- No, you do not do anything weird

1299
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:31,782
- Before this jury, would you?
- Of course not.

1300
01:22:31,782 --> 01:22:35,920
No, after all, you now says he is not Satan.

1301
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,622
That's right. Well, now we have fun, no? Now ...

1302
01:22:38,622 --> 01:22:41,225
- Wait just a minute more, friend.
- Hey! No. ..

1303
01:22:41,225 --> 01:22:43,627
- What ... No, no, no.
- Are you paying attention now, right?

1304
01:22:43,627 --> 01:22:45,696
Yes, sometimes ... You know what? Stop ...

1305
01:22:45,696 --> 01:22:48,899
Stop shaking it in front of my face, please. I'm asking.

1306
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:50,668
- It'll be even better.
- Your Honor!

1307
01:22:50,668 --> 01:22:52,903
He's shaking a Bible here in front of me.

1308
01:22:52,903 --> 01:22:57,074
- I have something special here for you.
- I'm sure yes.

1309
01:22:57,074 --> 01:23:00,976
- James, chapter 4, verse 7.
- Oh, no.

1310
01:23:02,246 --> 01:23:05,382
Submit yourselves to God.

1311
01:23:05,382 --> 01:23:09,443
Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

1312
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:14,619
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.

1313
01:23:15,059 --> 01:23:18,195
Cleanse your hands, sinners,

1314
01:23:18,195 --> 01:23:21,732
and purify your hearts, you who have a split mind.

1315
01:23:21,732 --> 01:23:24,435
Have you finished? Oh, no.

1316
01:23:24,435 --> 01:23:29,473
By the power and truth of these scriptures

1317
01:23:29,473 --> 01:23:32,340
and in the name of Jesus Christ,

1318
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,972
get behind me, Satan!

1319
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,672
How?

1320
01:23:38,315 --> 01:23:40,151
I said:

1321
01:23:40,151 --> 01:23:45,487
Stay behind me, Satan! In the name of Jesus Christ!

1322
01:23:48,893 --> 01:23:53,921
Excuse me, Satan, return to the witness stand.

1323
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,636
Sorry.
- This was unusual.

1324
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:01,338
I. .. I am sick, Your Honor.

1325
01:24:01,338 --> 01:24:03,533
It makes it all the time?

1326
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:07,511
I bet that causes a lot of laughs, right?

1327
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:09,647
You could not even be Satan,

1328
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:13,684
after all, the Bible clearly says that if we resist the devil,

1329
01:24:13,684 --> 01:24:15,652
he will flee.

1330
01:24:18,289 --> 01:24:20,991
- But this does not apply to you, is not it?
- No.

1331
01:24:20,991 --> 01:24:22,827
I. .. I usually ...

1332
01:24:22,827 --> 01:24:27,787
Stay behind me, Satan!

1333
01:24:31,335 --> 01:24:35,940
I have a proposition for you, friend.

1334
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:39,310
Come on, friend Luke, what do you think?

1335
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:43,647
I give you everything you could want in this life.

1336
01:24:43,647 --> 01:24:47,651
Riches, beautiful houses, horses.

1337
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:50,554
And what will this cost me? My soul?

1338
01:24:50,554 --> 01:24:53,991
Therefore, only your soul. It's nothing. His soul ...

1339
01:24:53,991 --> 01:24:57,328
You can take your offer and throw it in the trash.

1340
01:24:57,328 --> 01:24:58,629
Order!

1341
01:24:58,629 --> 01:25:01,723
Go back to the witness stand, sir.

1342
01:25:02,433 --> 01:25:05,102
This was very irrational.

1343
01:25:05,102 --> 01:25:09,673
In fact, you look up stupid now.

1344
01:25:09,673 --> 01:25:12,039
____How about that?

1345
01:25:15,512 --> 01:25:18,616
Would you please go back to the bank?

1346
01:25:18,616 --> 01:25:20,684
Will you shut up?

1347
01:25:20,684 --> 01:25:23,687
Not done yet! Shut up! Shut up!

1348
01:25:23,687 --> 01:25:27,591
And you, what are you looking at?

1349
01:25:27,591 --> 01:25:29,183
Something funny?

1350
01:25:29,493 --> 01:25:31,929
I know all about you.

1351
01:25:31,929 --> 01:25:35,299
I know all your secrets.

1352
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:37,868
- Players are addicted to sex ...
- The witness ...

1353
01:25:37,868 --> 01:25:39,803
_____Shut up!
- Lord accused ...

1354
01:25:39,803 --> 01:25:41,438
_____Shut up!
- Go back to the bank ...

1355
01:25:41,438 --> 01:25:43,474
____Sit!
- Where is your place.

1356
01:25:43,474 --> 01:25:45,237
- Take your ...
- Shut up!

1357
01:25:51,582 --> 01:25:54,318
I know all about you, all of you.

1358
01:25:54,318 --> 01:25:56,343
I'm watching you.

1359
01:25:59,089 --> 01:26:01,492
- I want to know tShe truth.

1360
01:26:01,492 --> 01:26:05,724
The real truth, sincere and true?

1361
01:26:07,631 --> 01:26:11,602
I delight ...

1362
01:26:11,602 --> 01:26:14,571
I wreak havoc in the world.

1363
01:26:15,072 --> 01:26:18,075
In playing the rich against the poor,

1364
01:26:18,075 --> 01:26:19,777
race against race,

1365
01:26:19,777 --> 01:26:23,113
country against country, man against man,

1366
01:26:23,113 --> 01:26:25,604
but especially

1367
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:29,381
man against God.

1368
01:26:30,454 --> 01:26:32,786
Yes, God.

1369
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:36,582
God, God. Yes, God.

1370
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:42,456
Do you know what God invented?

1371
01:26:43,233 --> 01:26:47,171
Now most of you are very idiot to realize it.

1372
01:26:47,171 --> 01:26:52,109
God created the oceans and the stars,

1373
01:26:52,109 --> 01:26:55,312
created compassion, forgiveness e. ..

1374
01:26:55,312 --> 01:26:58,282
stupid things like love.

1375
01:26:58,282 --> 01:27:01,618
He created good health, raindrops,

1376
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:04,485
and the essence of jasmine.

1377
01:27:05,155 --> 01:27:08,886
You know what I created? Do you know?

1378
01:27:09,193 --> 01:27:12,496
I created the sound,

1379
01:27:12,496 --> 01:27:15,299
and how stupid you are, you loved it!

1380
01:27:15,299 --> 01:27:18,135
Humans love the sounds that I created.

1381
01:27:18,135 --> 01:27:20,771
Alarm automobiles, motorcycles, whistles,

1382
01:27:20,771 --> 01:27:23,741
nightclubs, gangster rap, techno music,

1383
01:27:23,741 --> 01:27:26,844
invented anything that creates noise.

1384
01:27:26,844 --> 01:27:28,545
And you know why?

1385
01:27:28,545 --> 01:27:32,504
The noise away any thought of God.

1386
01:27:36,086 --> 01:27:37,821
What is the problem?

1387
01:27:37,821 --> 01:27:41,222
Do not you love the song of hell?

1388
01:27:45,362 --> 01:27:48,532
Let me tell you a secret.

1389
01:27:48,532 --> 01:27:52,036
I invented the customer service.

1390
01:27:52,036 --> 01:27:55,130
Automatic answer, my idea too.

1391
01:27:55,606 --> 01:27:58,040
Notification unfair? It came from me.

1392
01:27:58,876 --> 01:28:02,175
A huge bill and unjust, by me.

1393
01:28:02,513 --> 01:28:04,014
Traffic tickets?

1394
01:28:04,014 --> 01:28:08,585
They are my utility companies, oil and car parks.

1395
01:28:08,585 --> 01:28:12,022
Who do you think applies fines? I do this to annoy you,

1396
01:28:12,022 --> 01:28:15,014
because I hate to the core!

1397
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,928
You humans are pathetic.

1398
01:28:28,806 --> 01:28:31,508
I can try Ios with a chocolate bar

1399
01:28:31,508 --> 01:28:35,035
and you deny Jesus Christ in a millisecond.

1400
01:28:35,846 --> 01:28:37,247
After all ...

1401
01:28:37,247 --> 01:28:41,785
people are massacred in Rwanda, and you yawn.

1402
01:28:41,785 --> 01:28:44,221
Starving people in Haiti,

1403
01:28:44,221 --> 01:28:47,191
and you give a money supply in the church.

1404
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:49,126
Failed!

1405
01:28:49,126 --> 01:28:52,289
What a bunch of losers!

1406
01:29:05,843 --> 01:29:07,208
War!

1407
01:29:08,312 --> 01:29:10,948
They knew that most wars begin over land?

1408
01:29:10,948 --> 01:29:14,084
Believe? For land dispute.

1409
01:29:14,084 --> 01:29:17,287
And yet, 75% of the land is unoccupied,

1410
01:29:17,287 --> 01:29:19,089
even in the U.S.!

1411
01:29:19,089 --> 01:29:21,859
Oh yes, I know, I started the wars,

1412
01:29:21,859 --> 01:29:25,920
but it is idiots like you need to finish what I started.

1413
01:29:35,305 --> 01:29:40,110
I need people who care about silly political disputes.

1414
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:42,479
The left versus right,

1415
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,506
is all a distraction, do you not see?

1416
01:29:48,852 --> 01:29:50,979
You know, you ...

1417
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:55,592
you believe in God as much as I believe in fairy tales.

1418
01:29:55,592 --> 01:29:57,461
By the way,

1419
01:29:57,461 --> 01:29:59,496
I love the way depicted in the media.

1420
01:29:59,496 --> 01:30:02,232
That doll with a pitchfork,

1421
01:30:02,232 --> 01:30:05,099
horns and tail.

1422
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:13,535
You humans are so stupid.

1423
01:30:14,745 --> 01:30:18,511
They are like a bunch of rats running on a wheel.

1424
01:30:19,116 --> 01:30:23,348
You see, every day people die,

1425
01:30:24,154 --> 01:30:25,789
and want to know?

1426
01:30:25,789 --> 01:30:29,393
They can be in two places, and are not really dead.

1427
01:30:29,393 --> 01:30:33,664
Are alive in heaven or in hell are alive.

1428
01:30:33,664 --> 01:30:34,961
You choose.

1429
01:30:44,174 --> 01:30:47,544
You know what my biggest goal?

1430
01:30:47,544 --> 01:30:52,277
It's me take you all to hell!

1431
01:30:52,983 --> 01:30:56,783
It is the world coming to an end, right? It better be fast.

1432
01:30:57,754 --> 01:31:02,282
I guess they wonder why I do what I do.

1433
01:31:04,027 --> 01:31:05,824
This is very easy.

1434
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:12,402
It's because I hate to the core!

1435
01:31:12,402 --> 01:31:18,272
I hate every one of you!

1436
01:31:32,456 --> 01:31:33,821
Have a nice day.

1437
01:31:34,424 --> 01:31:37,621
THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY

1438
01:31:44,568 --> 01:31:46,136
Your Honor,

1439
01:31:46,136 --> 01:31:50,340
ask the court to disregard any statement of our client.

1440
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:53,377
He did so under duress of prosecution complete

1441
01:31:53,377 --> 01:31:56,913
and the civil procedure code 598.91,

1442
01:31:56,913 --> 01:31:59,616
it can not be judged by this court.

1443
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,952
The problem, Your Honor, is ...

1444
01:32:01,952 --> 01:32:06,355
the mental state of our client, it's crazy.

1445
01:32:10,193 --> 01:32:13,797
As I do not want to appeal this case,

1446
01:32:13,797 --> 01:32:16,867
the testimony will be removed from the file.

1447
01:32:16,867 --> 01:32:18,435
Your Honor, I ...

1448
01:32:18,435 --> 01:32:21,638
I want you all to follow my instruction:

1449
01:32:21,638 --> 01:32:24,007
Do not take into account

1450
01:32:24,007 --> 01:32:27,744
nothing that the accused uttered.

1451
01:32:27,744 --> 01:32:30,781
Is based only on what they heard, saw,

1452
01:32:30,781 --> 01:32:35,686
and witnessed the events and statements from witnesses.

1453
01:32:35,686 --> 01:32:37,347
I clear?

1454
01:32:40,624 --> 01:32:43,718
Defence lawyer closure.

1455
01:32:48,432 --> 01:32:50,866
Distinguished members of the jury,

1456
01:32:51,535 --> 01:32:53,637
let's think for a moment ...

1457
01:32:53,637 --> 01:32:58,700
what kind of man sue someone in 8 trillion.

1458
01:33:00,644 --> 01:33:04,147
Individual and selfish,

1459
01:33:04,147 --> 01:33:08,852
wanting to attract attention, and that can not free himself from his past.

1460
01:33:08,852 --> 01:33:12,422
And even if my client seems to be charismatic,

1461
01:33:12,422 --> 01:33:16,620
even if he wants to make a scene in court, he is mentally ill.

1462
01:33:17,794 --> 01:33:19,625
He is insane,

1463
01:33:20,497 --> 01:33:22,332
he needs help,

1464
01:33:22,332 --> 01:33:23,959
of piety,

1465
01:33:25,102 --> 01:33:26,729
not a process.

1466
01:33:28,305 --> 01:33:31,975
And it should not be associated with all the evil,

1467
01:33:31,975 --> 01:33:33,643
or to be Satan himself,

1468
01:33:33,643 --> 01:33:37,602
and this is not the apple that Eve bit the fruit

1469
01:33:38,014 --> 01:33:39,641
in the Garden of Eden.

1470
01:33:40,717 --> 01:33:42,919
So I ask you

1471
01:33:42,919 --> 01:33:44,978
they conclude today

1472
01:33:45,722 --> 01:33:49,818
as well as any logical person would do and sober,

1473
01:33:50,594 --> 01:33:52,755
that my client ...

1474
01:33:55,432 --> 01:33:57,200
is innocent.

1475
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,658
Now Mr. O'Brian, closure.

1476
01:34:02,472 --> 01:34:04,099
Mr. O'Brien?

1477
01:34:15,786 --> 01:34:19,456
Satan brought up my past.

1478
01:34:19,456 --> 01:34:20,980
He's right.

1479
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:24,124
I did horrible things.

1480
01:34:25,262 --> 01:34:28,095
I said horrible things and cruel.

1481
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,494
And I ask forgiveness from those who hurt.

1482
01:34:36,072 --> 01:34:37,664
Every day ...

1483
01:34:38,942 --> 01:34:41,069
there is a battle within me.

1484
01:34:41,845 --> 01:34:44,681
I know what I should do.

1485
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:46,808
And sometimes do not.

1486
01:34:48,018 --> 01:34:50,520
I know I should not do.

1487
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,988
Sometimes I do it anyway.

1488
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:59,085
But this is the struggle to choose between good and evil.

1489
01:34:59,863 --> 01:35:03,492
Between God and Satan.

1490
01:35:05,235 --> 01:35:07,760
Each day is a struggle

1491
01:35:08,839 --> 01:35:11,706
to live a life that honors Jesus Christ.

1492
01:35:13,076 --> 01:35:16,341
But when we surrender our lives to Jesus

1493
01:35:17,113 --> 01:35:20,241
we are new people.

1494
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:28,089
Satan's mission is to destroy God's work.

1495
01:35:30,026 --> 01:35:33,985
We humans are God's work.

1496
01:35:36,099 --> 01:35:39,728
We make mistakes and He forgives us.

1497
01:35:42,272 --> 01:35:46,504
Do not let Satan steal them from us.

1498
01:35:47,477 --> 01:35:49,536
Make him pay ...

1499
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:53,715
for his attempts to destroy our lives.

1500
01:35:54,451 --> 01:35:56,919
Let him be punished for their hatred.

1501
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:01,413
And thank God for his love

1502
01:36:02,592 --> 01:36:04,583
and forgiveness.

1503
01:36:07,364 --> 01:36:11,334
You see, the greatest trick the devil ever done

1504
01:36:11,334 --> 01:36:14,667
was convincing the world he did not exist.

1505
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,271
But this illusion is over.

1506
01:36:22,145 --> 01:36:23,112
Thank you."

1507
01:36:25,181 --> 01:36:27,172
Stand-up

1508
01:36:51,474 --> 01:36:53,710
They reached a verdict?

1509
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:54,911
Yes, Your Honor.

1510
01:36:54,911 --> 01:36:57,681
The jury is favorable to the prosecution

1511
01:36:57,681 --> 01:37:00,149
at 8 trillion dollars.

1512
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,732
Order!

1513
01:37:22,105 --> 01:37:23,504
Order!

1514
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:26,766
And Satan, you can go straight to hell!

1515
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:46,296
Tasheila Jones, the news channel 2,

1516
01:37:46,296 --> 01:37:49,026
We are out here and the verdict was announced!

1517
01:37:49,699 --> 01:37:51,468
What do you think the verdict?

1518
01:37:51,468 --> 01:37:52,636
It was a fantastic result!

1519
01:37:52,636 --> 01:37:54,968
Luke fought for what he wanted and won. He did it!

1520
01:38:09,019 --> 01:38:10,987
What you want, your insignificant?

1521
01:38:10,987 --> 01:38:12,489
Can I have your autograph?

1522
01:38:12,489 --> 01:38:15,287
Are you kidding me? Get out!

1523
01:38:17,827 --> 01:38:19,488
Order!

1524
01:38:20,196 --> 01:38:21,220
Order!

1525
01:38:28,171 --> 01:38:31,038
TALK WITH DR. The GOD OF JAMES INJUSTlÇA

1526
01:38:35,645 --> 01:38:38,782
Oh, you woke up? It was a long night.

1527
01:38:38,782 --> 01:38:41,751
What?"
- How to get here, sir?

1528
01:38:42,886 --> 01:38:45,155
I do not know. I think I slept the whole night here.

1529
01:38:45,155 --> 01:38:47,957
Well, I do not want to wake Io, but ...

1530
01:38:47,957 --> 01:38:51,085
you were saying, "Get behind me, Satan!"

1531
01:38:51,795 --> 01:38:53,126
Stay ...

1532
01:38:53,663 --> 01:38:55,799
Oh, I must be dreaming!

1533
01:38:55,799 --> 01:38:58,996
Well, do not study too much.

1534
01:39:10,113 --> 01:39:14,184
Girls, girls. It's a new day.

1535
01:39:14,184 --> 01:39:16,311
It's a new day!

1536
01:39:24,594 --> 01:39:26,084
Gwen?

1537
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:29,632
- Gwen?
- Luke?

1538
01:39:29,632 --> 01:39:32,102
- Where were you?
- Honey, are you sick?

1539
01:39:32,102 --> 01:39:35,805
No, I'm sick. Where were you? Not called me last night.

1540
01:39:35,805 --> 01:39:38,208
Sorry, dear, sorry. I went to the library

1541
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:39,542
- And fell asleep.
- In the library?

1542
01:39:39,542 --> 01:39:42,779
I fell asleep and dreamed that you were ill e. ..

1543
01:39:42,779 --> 01:39:44,514
and you did not tell me the dream.

1544
01:39:44,514 --> 01:39:47,784
- You have cancer, e. ..
- Cancer?

1545
01:39:47,784 --> 01:39:51,454
- Are you sick? You are telling the truth?
- I'm fine, but ...

1546
01:39:51,454 --> 01:39:55,325
I thought you would kill the man who killed his mother.

1547
01:39:55,325 --> 01:39:58,995
Honey, no. No, no, you have to hear me. I had ...

1548
01:39:58,995 --> 01:40:01,998
a dream about the devil and I beat him,

1549
01:40:01,998 --> 01:40:04,701
I sued in court and won.

1550
01:40:04,701 --> 01:40:08,304
- E. .. What, him?
- I saw the gun in his car, Luke.

1551
01:40:08,304 --> 01:40:10,907
I saw the gun in your car!

1552
01:40:10,907 --> 01:40:13,943
I thought you were killing the man who killed his mother.

1553
01:40:13,943 --> 01:40:16,679
No, no, dear. This has already happened.

1554
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:18,748
You can't.
- It's gone. I must be honest with you.

1555
01:40:18,748 --> 01:40:20,416
I would do it, but ...

1556
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:22,185
Honey, I'm sorry.

1557
01:40:22,185 --> 01:40:23,753
- You scared me.
- I'm so sorry.

1558
01:40:23,753 --> 01:40:25,655
I found peace, dear.

1559
01:40:25,655 --> 01:40:28,558
I found my peace, I found God. I found my God!

1560
01:40:28,558 --> 01:40:32,328
And you know what? I'll forgive Io, Io I will forgive.

1561
01:40:32,328 --> 01:40:33,795
It's a new day.

1562
01:40:34,397 --> 01:40:36,058
It's a new day.

1563
01:40:41,104 --> 01:40:45,041
And so began the first day of my new life.

1564
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:49,312
A life that will obey the Lord and drive away the enemy.

1565
01:40:49,312 --> 01:40:53,214
I feel wonderful. Thank you, God.

1566
01:40:57,554 --> 01:41:00,256
You querser great, Luke?

1567
01:41:00,256 --> 01:41:02,458
You're not a loser.

1568
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:05,361
Want to earn much money, Luke?

1569
01:41:05,361 --> 01:41:07,921
You're not a loser.

1570
01:41:08,264 --> 01:41:10,567
You're not a loser, huh?

1571
01:41:10,567 --> 01:41:12,933
Think of Gwen.

1572
01:41:13,236 --> 01:41:16,606
You have no authority over me, Satan.

1573
01:41:16,606 --> 01:41:18,441
Got it?

1574
01:41:18,441 --> 01:41:20,176
Who are you?

1575
01:41:20,176 --> 01:41:23,612
I am a believer in Jesus Christ.

1576
01:41:27,917 --> 01:41:33,456
The Savior, He can move mountains.

1577
01:41:33,456 --> 01:41:37,093
My God is mighty to save.

1578
01:41:37,093 --> 01:41:40,830
He is mighty to save.

1579
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:46,536
Forever Author of salvation,

1580
01:41:46,536 --> 01:41:50,273
He rose and conquered death.

1581
01:41:50,273 --> 01:41:54,437
