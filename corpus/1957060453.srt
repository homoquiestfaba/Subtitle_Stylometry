Tom!

22
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,876
You usually hide your
hangovers better.

Yeah, uniform got glitter on it?

27
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:30,834
Oh, no, the room was dark.

28
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,667
I couldn't tell which one
was mine, so pretty sure

29
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,934
this is her uniform
from the athletic store.

30
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:43,201
Fine, all right, I get it

31
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,234
It's unprofessional.

32
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,567

school in the morning.

I'll take the kid.

41
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,934
What happened?

42
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,600
I was sleeping in the bedroom,

43
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:33,867
and I heard French and,
and the wind.

44
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:38,934
[Dennis] Sir, can you hear me?

45
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,633

Miss, what'd the kid take?

52
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,967
What you got in your pockets?

00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,900

[Jacobs] Hands,

61
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:29,134
[Jacobs] Keep 'em up.

62
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,600
[Jacobs] Drop your weapon.

63
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:33,734

[Steve] How 'bout in there?

74
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:01,800
[Dennis] We've got a penetrating
trauma in the torso,

75
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:05,567
applying occlusive dressing

76
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,234

[Dennis] Knife wound
in his front.

80
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,034
[Dennis] Exit out his back.

00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,267
[Steve] A what?

82
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,834
[Dennis] We'll make an airway
en route.

00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,067
Probably did it to himself.

Yeah, heroin possession
is though.

93
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,667

[Dennis] Don't have kids
18 years apart, dude.

112
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,201
Well, you can't,
'cause we're old as fuck,

113
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:34,667
but gotta keep that window slim.

114
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,134
At least you can get
a free babysitter.

116
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,900
And even though Brianna's 18,
and I love my daughter to death,

117
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,633
she's a fuckin' awful
babysitter.

[Nurse Hall] The pills will help
against HIV.

119
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,867
It'll take about six weeks
to know for sure,

120
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,167
but I've never had a positive
from a needle stick.

121
00:10:56,934 --> 00:11:00,167
I sent it to the fast lab,
so give you a call tomorrow

122
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,067
about everything else.

123
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,101
Is there any reason we
shouldn't do a full workup?

124
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:07,633
Ignorance is bliss,
that's about it.

125
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,800
Hangovers worse than usual, but
that's probably from the drinkin

126
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,500
and recreational drug use.

127
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,734
We'll ignore the ganja
and booger sugar markers

128
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,134
Thank you.

129
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,167
Hey, what'd you get my baby
daughter?

130
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,800
[Steve] Uh, some condoms,
magnums.

131
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,067
[Dennis] Ah, Christ.

132
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:31,633
[Steve] Nah, they're earrings,
man.

133
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,867
She's one, man,
nothing's pierced.

134
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,067
It's strategy. So when you
give her the earrings,

135
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:38,667
she'll be old enough to know
that I got 'em for her.

136
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,867
Okay.

137
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,567
A tiny dress would be
a waste of money.

138
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,001
Look, babe, Uncle Steve's
sittin' all the way over here,

139
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:47,067
because he went and slept
with all mommy's friends

140
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,267
before they married all
those men over there.

141
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:50,368
- [Steve] That's not true.
- [Tara] Yes...

142
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,800
- [Dennis] Oh, it's kinda true.
- [Tara] Yes, it is.

143
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,734
[Steve] Let me hold the baby,
come on, let the girls see

144
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,667
- what they're missin'.
- Oh, that's a terrible idea.

145
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,934
[Steve] Come on,
I'd be a great dad, come on.

146
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,734
- Oh boy, okay.
- [Dennis] No, no.

147
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:00,834
- [Steve] look at that.
- [Dennis] Oh no, oh God.

148
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,967
- [Steve] Hey, ladies. Oh no.
- [Tara] Oh, the baby.

149
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,767
- [Dennis] Bad idea, bad idea.
- [baby cries]

150
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,067
[Steve] Oh, wait,
why's your baby...

151
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,533
And there we go!
What did you do?

152
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:08,800
- [Steve] No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, give her back.

153
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,267
[Tara] I think you busted her.
Give her back, give her back.

154
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:14,734
- Racist baby.
- [Dennis chuckles]

155
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,900
- [Steve laughs]
- [Tara] No.

156
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,967
She seems happy.

157
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,633
Yeah, no.

158
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,267
Give her a break, man.

159
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:33,533
She work during the day
with lawyers,

160
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,600
stay up all night with the kids,

161
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:37,934
then have to deal with
your ugly mug.

162
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,767
I'm gonna go say what's up
to Brianna

163
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,067
She's bein' a little emo,

164
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:57,267
incorrectly thinks you're cooler
than me, 'cause I'm her dad

165
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:59,800
and you're just some asshole
who pops up from time to time.

166
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,734
Yo, B.

167
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,201
Hey, what up?

168
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:10,867
- I got somethin' for you.
- Yeah.

169
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:20,934
You poured me a cheap one.

170
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,700
You're not old enough to know
what cheap beer is yet.

171
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:27,067
I'm 18, and I know this is some
cheap-ass lager.

172
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:29,633
Fuck, stop sayin' your age.
I don't want to think

173
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,167
about 18 years goin' by
that fast.

174
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:36,967
Why you sittin' over here
by yourself on this shitty rock?

175
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:42,134
There's cake and barbecue and
old, fat people over there.

176
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,201
There's something wrong with me.

177
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:44,734
[chuckles]

178
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:47,900
Uh, no, no one died or anything,
I just, uh, I, uh...

179
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,767
[phone vibrates]
Oh, excuse me for one second.

180
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,067
Hello?

181
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:54,667
[tense music]

182
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:05,001
Yeah, I'll be there on Tuesday,
Doctor, thank you.

183
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:08,034
[somber music]

184
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,201
[phone rings]

185
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:18,600
- [clanks]
- [phone rings]

186
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,767
[groans]

187
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,667
[park girl] Fuck, firemen
have to get up early.

188
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,567
[Steve] Yeah.

189
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,001
[splashes]

190
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,633
[Steve] What time
you go to work?

191
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,767
[park girl] I'm between jobs,

192
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,967
so I thought it'd be a good time
to visit with friends,

193
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,867
but I'm thinkin' about makin'
an app for power crystals,

194
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,001
or astrology, or both,
I don't know.

195
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:48,533
[Steve] That sounds like
a really bad idea.

196
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,201
[Steve] Look,
I have to run to work, so, um.

197
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:54,734
Uh, oh, it was nice to meet you.

198
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,967
[Steve] It was nice
to meet you, too.

199
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,867
[Steve] Be sure to lock the door
on your way out, okay?

200
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,067
[somber music]

201
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,700
[sobbing]

202
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:36,001
Brianna wants to move onto
campus, a room opened up.

203
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,700
That's what she wants?

204
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,001
Yeah.

205
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,434
I'll, uh, I'll miss her.

206
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,700
[wood scratches]

207
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,134
Gonna go with seven milligrams
of morphine, in case the burn's

208
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,967
second degree.
You think of anything else?

209
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,001
Uh, dry wraps.

210
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,934
Hey, can you reach me
a codeine, please?

211
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,667
- [tires screeching]
- [grunts]

212
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,567
Shit, fuckin' Tom!

213
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,867
Well, at least it's not you
driving.

214
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,834
[Steve] What the fuck are you
talking about?

215
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:26,734
- [Steve] I'm a great driver.
- No, you're not.

216
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:27,967
[Steve] I'm the best driver
you know.

217
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:31,734
Nope, and a black man drivin'
through the Garden District,

218
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,234
we'd be pulled over so much,
there'd be people dyin'

219
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:34,734
- all over New Orleans.
- [pills clatter]

220
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,600
[tense music]

221
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,034
[siren wailing]

222
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
[suspenseful music]

223
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,867
Where's the victim?

224
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,134
Why'd y'all tell dispatch
there was a burn victim?

225
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,867
[Jacobs] There he is.

226
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:19,201
Yeah, uh, that's a body,
not a burn victim.

227
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,633
New kid called it in.

228
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,800
What happened to him?

229
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,867
Passed out with a cigarette
in his mouth or, you know.

230
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,734
What?

231
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,067
Beaumont, what'd you call this?

232
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,600
[Beaumont] Spontaneous
human combustion.

233
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,900
- [police radio chatter]
- He's way into that shit.

234
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,834
Yeah, how do we put that
in a report?

235
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:44,067
Anyways, somethin' to be aware
of, honey bears.

236
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,533
Passed out smoking, easy enough.

237
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,667
It's evidence or whatever,
so maybe don't touch it.

238
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,167
- [bird squawks]
- [dog barks]

239
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:04,767
[suspenseful music]

240
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,201
[alarm beeping]

241
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,067
[MRI beeping]

242
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:17,734
[thunder rumbling]

243
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,201
[heavy rain pattering]

244
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:21,734
[buzzing]

245
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,867
[sighs]

246
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,934
[siren wailing]

247
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,867
[radio chatter]

248
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,633
- [Bob] It's a snake bite.
- [Steve] Yeah, no shit.

249
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,567
Miss, you happen to know
what kind of snake bit you?

250
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,667
Travis.

251
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,867
We need to figure out what kind
of poison this is.

252
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,667
[Bob] A Venom.

253
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,067
It's not poison, it's venom.

254
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,834
- That's what I said.
- That's not what you said.

255
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,001
That's exactly what I said.

256
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,967
My ears be working and shit,
that ain't what you said...

257
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,533
So you gonna tell me what I said
two seconds ago?

258
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,101
That's okay, okay, okay.

259
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:36,734
Well, he's gotta be here
somewhere.

260
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,067
We've searched through
everything, man. It's not here.

261
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,234
Travis.
[cries]

262
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,267
Oh, she checked in with
her boyfriend.

263
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:47,001
- Travis.
- [Steve] Dennis, look.

264
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:50,201
Dispatch, unit 101 requesting
back up to the 9th Street Hotel.

265
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:52,934
We got a snakebite and
an unknown possible O.D.

266
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,800
A snake on the second
floor of a fucking hotel.

267
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,267
[Steve] You remember that
snakebite we ran out on

268
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,101
in the boonies near Chalmette?

269
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,934
Hey, Miss, are you in
a Pentecostal religion?

270
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,800
- [breathes heavily]
- [radio chatter]

271
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,767
Some dude walkin' around
with a fucking copperhead,

272
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,500
- he thinks God's gonna save him.
- It ain't no fuckin' copperhead.

273
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:15,368
Well, what is it, bruh?

274
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:18,633
I mean, the punctures,
they're not the right size,

275
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,067
and her response to the... venom

276
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:27,267
it could only be a fuckin'..
Eastern Diamondback Rattler?

277
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,667
There hasn't been an Eastern
Diamondback

278
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,800
seen in Louisiana in decades

279
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,734
[Leah breathes shakily]

280
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,633
All right, want to help me
find it?

281
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,201
I know I can grab that
motherfucker.

282
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,800
[Dennis] Okay.

283
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,734
Miss, I'm gonna find your friend

284
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,667
Steve here's gonna mark the rate
of swelling,

285
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,900
so the ER know how much
anti-venom to use, okay?

286
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,800
This is fucking pointless,
okay, let's go.

287
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:57,934
All right, y'all be safe.

288
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,900
[shuddering]

289
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,234
[suspenseful music]

290
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
[car approaching]

291
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,800
- [siren wailing]
- [knocks]

292
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,734
Is it broken?

293
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,134
There was a loud crash

294
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,001
Something might have
hit the sensor.

295
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,234
[clanks]

296
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,101
[suspenseful music]

297
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:48,234
[siren wailing]

298
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,700
[Doctor] It's, um,
it's an odd one.

299
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:21,101
[Doctor] You see here?
That's your pineal gland.

300
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:24,167
Now usually when there's a tumor
in this area, it's inside,

301
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:27,934
but yours is at the top,
here, like a soda cap.

302
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,633
[Doctor] I've never quite
seen that.

303
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,001
So what are you saying?

304
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:32,800
[Doctor] Usually,
an adult pineal gland

305
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,633
is calcified to some extent,

306
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,633
basically hardening with age,
but yours is like a teenager's.

307
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,567
My boyfriend's New Agey friend
thinks it's a third eye seat of

308
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,067
the soul or whatever, so maybe
your unique endocrine gland

309
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,533
makes you more enlightened.

310
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,067
So how does that affect
the cancer?

311
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:53,067
[Doctor] It suggests to me
it's been there a while,

312
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:55,700
but it also looks like a
glioblastoma,

313
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:57,134
which are extremely
aggressive so...

314
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,867
So it won't be a slow death?

315
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,767
I gave you the good news first.

316
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,834
[door opens]

317
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,700
[approaching footsteps]

318
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,800
Hello.

319
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,201
[Tara] Hey listen, I know you're
like a grown-ass lady

320
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:19,800
about to move out of my house,

321
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,934
but if you're gonna stay out
all night,

322
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,967
can you at least text us,
please?

323
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,934
All right.

324
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,267
[Tara] All right?

325
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:30,934
Good morning.

326
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,201
- Good morning
- [Tara] I love you.

327
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:33,600
I love you, too.

328
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,700
The bad news is it's inoperable,

329
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:46,167
and we'll have to begin
treatment no matter what.

330
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:48,001
[Doctor] We'll have to track it.

331
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,600
Truthfully,
you could have six weeks

332
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:51,600
or you could have 60 years

333
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:54,600
There's a degree of chance,
but closer to six weeks

334
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,201
if we don't start you on
radiation immediately.

335
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,167
I, uh...

336
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,067
In the meantime, here's some
support groups

337
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:16,267
and supplementary
alternative therapies

338
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:20,667
that patients have found helpful
and ways of telling your family.

339
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:25,533
[sighs]

340
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,134
[ball bouncing]

341
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,967
- [Dennis] Whoa!
- [Brianna] Ah.

342
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:46,267
All right, what's up with your
grades? Are you depressed?

343
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,767
What? No.

344
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,167
Just, um, I don't know
what I wanna do.

345
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:55,800
About what?

346
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,967
My pregnancy.

347
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,234
Yeah, the father, he's being
really weird about it.

348
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,867
No, like,

349
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,267
like for work, like a job, you
know, when college is done.

350
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:10,800
Oh, so you have a,
you have a C average

351
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,700
because you don't know what you
wanna be when you grow up?

352
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,934
Well, now you're making it sound
ridiculous, but,

353
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:18,267
seriously, it's a lot of like
crazy hard work

354
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:21,767
for not knowing where it's going
or if I can even do it.

355
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:28,667
[clanks]
Of course you can do it.

356
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,134
All right, let's think about
this. What do you like?

357
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,267
When you were a kid,
you used to love watching

358
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,533
the X-Files with me.

359
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,667
You should be an FBI agent.

360
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,633
[ball bounces]

361
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,800
[dramatic music]

362
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,700
All right.
Let's play Horse without the E

363
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,001
Look, I'm gonna say
what I always say,

364
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,533
but just listen this time.

365
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,967
[ominous music]

- [sighs]

367
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:38,234
You remember this song from
high school?

368
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:42,101
Redman sampled Claude Debussy.

369
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,934
Funny I can remember that,
but I can't remember

370
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,468
four years of AP French.

371
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:48,267
Life's not fair.
[woman laughing]

372
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,867
Hey.

373
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:54,700
Happy birthday.

374
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:56,134
[indistinct chatter]

375
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:57,468
[chuckles]

376
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:02,567
Boom.

377
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:14,134
Uh, it's real science-y.

378
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:17,101
[Dennis chuckles]
Yeah. Thanks, man.

379
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:18,767
You know, when you think
about it,

380
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,267
strip clubs are like the one
place you really can't have sex.

381
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:23,734
Highlights certain things.

382
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,134
[indistinct chatter]

383
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:30,867
Doubts, man, they never go away.

384
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,134
You know, you think the wedding
day is gonna dissolve that,

385
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,600
and it is profound, but,
you know, the doubts,

386
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,867
- they never go.
- I get it, bro.

387
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,067
You're a guy in a relationship.

388
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,934
You want this?

389
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,167
No.

390
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,167
But there's these few hours
on a Sunday morning,

391
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,667
after breakfast,
the kids are there,

392
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,767
we're having coffee together,

393
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,667
listening to music,
and I feel like

394
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,267
I'm supposed to feel, you know?

395
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,167
I haven't felt anything but

396
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:01,767
whiskey and a hard dick
in a decade.

397
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:04,267
[Dennis] You're a blessed man.

398
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,567
[indistinct chatter]

399
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,734
All right, as your humble,

400
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,201
hypocritical, idiot,

401
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,967
drunken, birthday celebratin'
best friend,

402
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:19,034
what's goin' on
with all the pain killers?

403
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,834
It's fine, man.

404
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,800
I know, I know, just promise
me you won't become

405
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,167
a junkie-paramedic-cliche.

406
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:30,667
I promise I won't become
a junkie-paramedic-cliche.

Upstairs balcony!

413
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:28,600
Miss, can you hear me?

414
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,800
Can you hear me?

415
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:31,900
W-W-What?

416
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:34,734
Do you know your name?

417
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:41,134
I'm not the police.

418
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,101
You, you need to help Tim.
He has a heart condition,

419
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,600
and I think he took
too much coke.

420
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,267
Before I passed out,

421
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:53,800
his chest was hurting.

422
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,301
Okay, okay, I'll get to Tim.

423
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,067
I just need to know if there's
somebody else

424
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,101
that might need some help.

425
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,567
Brianna.

426
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:08,700
Okay, where's Brianna,
and what did she take?

427
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:11,067
She took the fake Ayahuasca
from the store

428
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,134
when she was sitting
right there.

429

[man yells in the background]

433
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,034
Yeah, I know, just please,
just please do it.

434
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,067
Do it now, yes, please.

Tara, she's missing.

Uh, I'm gonna call you back
after I've, uh...

439
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:58,600

How can I help you, sir?

451
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:03,967
You have Synchronic?

00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,101
Uh.

453
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,834
- How many?
- [Steve] All of 'em.

454
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,667
You have any more in the back?

455
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,600
- Where?
- The back, back inventory

456
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,034
Oh we don't, we don't have that.

457
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,533
So when do you get more?

[chimes]

459
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,667
No, we don't, it's discontinued.

460
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,633
This happens a lot
with that stuff back there.

461
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,867
How much?

462
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,401
- [calculator clacks]
- $105.14.

463
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,667
You have good people dying
every day.

You in here killing your brain.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry, I didn't even know
I was bothering you.

- [Kermani] Excuse me, sir.
- What?

473
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,800
[Kermani] I know this sounds
strange, but, uh,

474
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,800
could I buy that Synchronic
off of you

475
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:21,034
- for triple what you just paid?
- No!

476
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,600
Go home to your wife or
your girlfriend, whoever.

477
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,234
Be glad you didn't ingest
this shit.

478
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:27,567
- I'll give you $2,000.
- Go home.

479
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,633

[machine whirrs]

482
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,967
[Tara] The cell phone company
said her cell is still inactive,

483
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,800
but I got a hold of one of
her friends from class

484
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,533
who thinks that maybe
she saw her

485
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,667
at a party earlier that night
and so I think if we just,

486
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,967
we just keep posting on
her social media.

487
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,067
[Dennis] What?

488
00:33:58,034 --> 00:33:59,134
What are you doing?

489
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:03,267
I'm printing these out,
and then I'm gonna put 'em up.

490
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:07,533
[Tara] Can't you do something
else while they're printing?

491
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,734
Like call every hospital
and jail in Louisiana

492
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:12,667
and call the credit card company
and ask the police to

493
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,533
search the Mississippi
while you were asleep?

494
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:18,633
[printer clicks]

495
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,234
Why would you search
the Mississippi?

496
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:26,533
[Dennis] You know what I mean.

497
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,667
She's not, she's not dead,

498
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,533
so why would you search
the Mississippi?

499
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,034
We have to be realistic.

500
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,934
I'm gonna, I'm gonna hire
a private investigator.

501
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:39,067
- The entire police department...
- What are you doing?

Come, come the fuck outta there!

517
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:18,834
- [Kermani] Wait, wait, wait!
- Get outta my house!

518
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,001
- Wait!
- You motherfucker, what the fuck

519
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,034
- are you doin' in my closet.
- I'm not here to hurt you!

520
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:23,001
- Get outta my house!
- My name is Dr. Kermani.

521
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:23,867
What the fuck are you doin'?
I don't care.

522
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm the chemist
who created Synchronic

00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,201
You're what?

525
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:29,934
My name is Dr. Kermani.

526
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,067
I'm the chemist who created
Synchronic.

527
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,667
[both panting]

528
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:37,600
Come outta there.

529
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:38,700
Okay.

530
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,201
- Take your jacket off.
- Okay.

531
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:45,767
Turn around.

532
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:52,667
[Kermani] Wait, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

533
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,533
[Kermani] No, no, no.

534
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,067
Hello, yes, I have an intruder

535
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,600
- in my house.
- [Kermani] No, no, wait, wait.

536
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:58,700
- [Kermani] I'm here to help!
- Yes, ma'am.

537
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:00,734
- Cause I heard you in the store.
- My address is 1827

538
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:01,834
- You've seen what it does!
- Alexandria Avenue.

539
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:03,234
- Help, man!
- Thank you.

540
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:06,834
All right, you have until
they get here, all right?

541
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:07,967
Now, lucky for you this
neighborhood,

542
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:10,001
has a shitty response time.

543
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:13,067
Can I, okay, all right.

544
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,134
I make synthetic drugs.

545
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:24,800
What I would do is create
new drugs

546
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:28,134
very similar to illegal drugs,
but the molecules just

547
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,201
different enough to be legal.

548
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:31,734
I know what designer drugs are.

549
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,867
The FDA finally cracked
down on every variant

550
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,167
we could come up with so
we rushed out to market

551
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:39,934
with what was meant to be
a DMT-like drug

552
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:43,034
that we synthesized from a
red flower that only grows

553
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:47,067
in a very isolated region
of the California desert...

554
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:49,101
Can I use the back of this?

555
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:59,267
My mother recently passed away,
I know how hard it is.

556
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:01,867
- [Kermani] Condolences.
- It's me.

557
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,600
I have a tumor on
my pineal gland.

558
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,101
Sorry to hear that.

559
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:12,800
But actually, um,

560
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:17,734
Synchronic messes
with the pineal,

561
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:21,767
so you experience time as it
actually is

562
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,201
rather than the linear,
one-event-after-another way

563
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,834
that we normally experience it.

564
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,234
Okay, um...

565
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,267
uh, here

566
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:37,267
You drop the needle on the song
you wanna play,

567
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:40,734
but they're all always there

568
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:44,700
These tracks are like time,
right?

569
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:47,867
Synchronic is the needle.

570
00:38:55,633 --> 00:39:00,167
Adults partially go, appearing
like ghosts in the past,

571
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:05,834
but kids, since their pineal
gland hasn't calcified,

572
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:08,567
they physically go to another
time entirely,

573
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,101
[Kermani]
Sometimes not returning.

574
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,934
You expect me to believe
that you came here

575
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:21,800
to atone for your evils, and
I'm just gonna give you back

576
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:22,934
your drug that's killing kids?

577
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:25,600
I mean, I only had a few
accounts at some gas stations,

578
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,800
smoke shops throughout
Louisiana, some other states.

579
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,767
I've been driving around
buying them out.

580
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,034
This was my last stop,

581
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:40,134
Well, too bad, I flushed it all.

582
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:42,567
So get out.

583
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:44,633
It's all gone?

584
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:47,134
Yeah.

585
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,600
All of it, all of it's gone.

586
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,834
Get the fuck out of my house.

587
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,600
When Kyle recruited me

588
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:05,900
I was working in a
generics lab in China.

589
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,567
Would've done anything
to get back home,

590
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:14,067
but I left a good teaching job
for that money, so...

591
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:27,034
There's just one more sample
to eliminate.

592
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:34,533
[door closes]

593
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,700
[panting]

594
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,201
[suspenseful music]

595
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,834
[machine whirring]

596
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,900
You know they say we see
everything once in this gig?

597
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,734
[siren wailing]

598
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,600
Pretty sure we've just seen
our first junkie sword fight.

599
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:14,934
[indistinct chatter]

600
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:23,800
- You all right?
- Yeah.

601
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,500
It's just a little
tequila headache, I'm fine.

602
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,067
[siren wailing]

603
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:43,267
[Dennis] Time for your, uh,
your sermon again.

604
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:51,167
[Steve] Sir,

605
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,967
there was a time when Dennis
here and I were

606
00:41:58,001 --> 00:41:59,167
gonna go to med school,

607
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:04,633
takin' a whole mess of science
pre-reqs.

608
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:09,667
Dennis here hated a lot of it,

609
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,734
but I sort of became a
armchair physicist.

610
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:19,934
No equations or anything,
just fun theories and history.

611
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:25,734
Like, do you know the letter
Einstein wrote

612
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:28,700
to his dear friend
Michele Besso's wife

613
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:31,533
after he passed away?

614
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:34,700
That's all right.

615
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,767
He said,

616
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,234
"Now he has departed this
strange world

617
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,800
a little ahead of me.

618
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,101
This means nothing.

619
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:47,734
People like us,

620
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:51,633
who believe in physics,

621
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:56,001
know that the distinction
between

622
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,001
the past, present, and future

623
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:01,834
is only a stubbornly...

624
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:05,134
<i>persistent illusion."</i>

625
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,533
- [groans]
- [vomits]

626
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:14,800
[thwacks]

627
00:43:16,633 --> 00:43:18,034
[phone vibrates]

628
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,067
- Hey, Captain.
- [captain] <i>Hey, Dennis,</i>

629
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:22,600
<i>do you have a minute?</i>

630
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,934
Yeah, what's up.

631
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,167
[captain] <i>I have a discrepancy
between the morphine</i>

632
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:28,267
<i>inventory and what the hospital
pharmacy says we logged.</i>

633
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:29,800
<i>I know you guys are clean,</i>

634
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:31,700
<i>but keep an eye on other shifts,
would ya?</i>

635
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,533
Yeah.

636
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:36,001
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

637
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,734
You know, you don't have to
be here.

638
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:41,267
We can get another paramedic
to come in.

639
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:43,533
I don't wanna go home,
I wanna fuckin' work.

640
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:46,734
Yeah, but you and Tara
should be together.

641
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:49,134
[dispatch] <i>All units be advised
we have and open fracture</i>

642
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,600
<i>at 1988 Bourbon Street.</i>

643
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:51,934
[Dennis] Unit 101 en route.

644
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,567
[thunder rumbles]

645
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,101
[tense music]

646
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,201
[suspenseful music]

647
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,700
Sir, can you tell me
what caused the injury?

648
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:28,101
[babbling, laughing]

649
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,834
Hey, do y'all know
what happened to him?

650
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:32,934
[babbling]

651
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,401
Did he fall from something?

652
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:38,867
Sir, we can get you out of here
as soon as possible, all right,

653
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,134
we just want to stabilize
the injury.

654
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,834
and we'll take you to the ER,
all right?

655
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,734
[speaking Creole]

656
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:47,600
Use saline to remove any large
contaminants.

657
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:48,934
I know.

658
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:50,667
[man speaking Creole]

659
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,234
Apply the splint.
Use some pressure.

660
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:55,167
Stop tellin' me how to do
my job, all right?

661
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:57,633
- Someone has to.
- What's that supposed to mean?

662
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,267
Sir, do not smoke that now.

663
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:01,734
[yelling in Creole]

664
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,067
You show up to work fucked up,

665
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,934
it's not gonna be on me
if you kill someone.

666
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:08,700

[Steve vomits]

669
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,834
We need to get a line
of morphine in him.

670
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:19,934
You sure we have morphine?

671
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,734
What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?

672
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,867
You can't deal with reality,

673
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,967
so you pop pills and get wasted
every night.

674
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,067
The reality you can't deal with

675
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:32,034
is you're a forty-something
child, and I've wasted

676
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:33,633
half my life
on bullshit loyalty.

677
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,867
Shut the fuck up!

678
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,834
I'm so fuckin' tired of you
complainin'.

679
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,067
You're disappointed in everybody
around you.

680
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:42,134
All you do is complain about
your fucking wife,

681
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:44,667
who's obviously too good
for you, and you don't give

682
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,667
a shit about your family!

683
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,867
I don't give a shit about
my family?

684
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,134
Yeah, 'cause you're a selfish
ass who only cares about...

[both panting]

00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:08,633
- Fuck you, D!
- [Dennis] Yeah.

692
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:09,734
Fuck you.

693
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,734
Fuck you, get back
in the ambulance

694
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,800
Shut the fuck up!
Tom, no, I need you,

695
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:16,267

I'm probably trying to

pretty unbelievable or I'm dead.

This...

756
00:52:26,758 --> 00:52:30,658
This is a time travel pill.

757
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,192
It allows you to go back in time
for about seven minutes.

758
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:34,758
I know it sounds...

759
00:52:36,392 --> 00:52:38,959

fucking crazy, but I was...

[sighs]

761
00:52:46,692 --> 00:52:48,192
I was just back in time.

762
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:53,658
In this exact geographical
location,

763
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:56,259
before it was all pumped out,
and it was still swampland.

764
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:00,025
Now, another observation,

765
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:05,859
things that touch you while
on the drug

766
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,292

Dennis Dannelly, who's probably
watchin' this if I'm dead,

769
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,925
his daughter Brianna took it,
and she disappeared.

770
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:22,226
So hopefully with these
experiments,

771
00:53:23,426 --> 00:53:25,192
I'll learn a way
to bring her back.

00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:34,658

I'm not exactly sure why

783
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:40,658
I went to a different time
than the first pill.

784
00:54:40,692 --> 00:54:44,725
The only difference is exactly
where I was in the room

785
00:54:45,692 --> 00:54:46,859
when the pill kicked in.

The past fucking sucks, man!

And, observation two,

801
00:57:34,758 --> 00:57:36,992
the exact place where you are
when the drug kicks in

802
00:57:37,025 --> 00:57:39,692
determines the time
you go back to.

803
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:41,159
For example,

804
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:47,126
this spot took me to
the Ice Age twice.

805
00:57:49,226 --> 00:57:53,359
This spot took me to the swamp,

And also leaves the question,

807
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,625
if this door works both ways,

808
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:05,825

Tell you a story.

820
00:59:14,025 --> 00:59:16,859
There was a time your dad
was goin' through a drought,

major drought.

822
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:21,359
Girl wouldn't talk to him
to save her life.

823

She would drown in a river
before talkin' to him.

824
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:27,259
I met your mom in a bar
one night.

825
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:30,792
She was really nice, but I was
tryin' to thin out my herd,

826
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:33,392

So I set him up.

827
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:37,392
Then you came along.

828
00:59:37,426 --> 00:59:41,292
Luckily, not ugly like your dad,
thanks to your mom.

829
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:45,326
So I say all that to say,

830

you're not gonna have the same
problems that your dad did.

01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:28,859
Come on, buddy, come on.

878
01:03:24,226 --> 01:03:26,658
What'd you, where did you?

879
01:03:26,692 --> 01:03:29,359
Now, sir, look, I apologize,
I can explain.

880
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:30,992
Police!

881
01:03:31,025 --> 01:03:32,825

[dog leash clanks]

884
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:42,192
Sir, if you'll just calm down,
we'll leave.

885
01:03:42,226 --> 01:03:43,725
- No, we'll leave, we'll leave!

890
01:04:39,426 --> 01:04:41,126
Shit.

[indistinct chatter]

894
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,859
As soon as he goes to sleep,

895
01:04:57,892 --> 01:05:00,025
we're gonna get high and
break in and get to our spot.

896
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:02,925
[indistinct chatter]

897
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:05,059
Sounds worse than it actually
is, right?

898
01:05:05,092 --> 01:05:07,226
- [woman] Go in there, and check.
- [man] Just keep looking.

899
01:05:08,226 --> 01:05:09,426
Here we go.

900
01:05:09,459 --> 01:05:11,292
[man] He's got to be someone...

[man] Sir, the window breaks.

906
01:05:22,892 --> 01:05:24,092
Here we go, boy.

907
01:05:24,126 --> 01:05:25,625
Come on, boy.

908
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:27,725
Ooh.

909
01:05:31,892 --> 01:05:33,192
[man] I'm gonna' search for...

910
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:34,825
[breathes heavily]

- Police!
- Hawking!

916
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:02,992
Hawking, come on, boy, come on!

917
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,792
Hawking, come on!

918
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:05,825
[yells]

919
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:07,658
- [Klansman] Is he in there?
- [Steve] Come on!

920
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:08,892
- Come on, boy!
- [door knocking]

921
01:06:08,925 --> 01:06:10,359

- [timer beeps]
- [Joe] Get in here!

923
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:13,192
[Steve] No, no, no!

924
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:14,292
- Hawking, no!
- [gunshot]

929
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:48,725
Hawking!

930
01:06:50,692 --> 01:06:52,292
[hawking cries]

931
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:05,092
Observation three.

932
01:07:06,825 --> 01:07:08,126
Don't...

933
01:07:10,825 --> 01:07:12,959
Don't be... shit!

934
01:07:13,925 --> 01:07:15,192
Don't be late.

935
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:19,625
Obs...

936
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:22,392
- Ooh.
- [dramatic music]

937
01:07:23,892 --> 01:07:25,326
So it seems you have to be
touching

938
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:26,925
whatever you bring back,

939
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:31,392
like quantum...
mixing or something.

940
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:33,692
Hawking had on his collar, so...

941
01:07:38,025 --> 01:07:41,259
It's chaotic how much of
anything comes back safely.

942
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:44,326
[dramatic music]

943
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:49,992
Either way, there aren't enough
pills for me to go back and...

944
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,792
find Hawking.

945
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:56,825
And if you're late...

946
01:08:03,925 --> 01:08:05,292
[leash clanks]

947
01:08:12,725 --> 01:08:15,259
[bells playing]

948
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:17,725
[Tara] You said that they
sounded like

949
01:08:17,758 --> 01:08:21,292
Rain Man on cocaine.
That is exactly what you said,

950
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:22,992
it's a direct quote.

951
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:24,992
- It's not very, very nice.
- Yeah, they do.

952
01:08:25,025 --> 01:08:25,925
Come on, babe.

953
01:08:25,959 --> 01:08:27,326
- They do.
- [Tara] Please, please, please,

954
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,758
Steve has other friends.

955
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:30,992
Look, um,

956
01:08:33,092 --> 01:08:34,792
there's something
I never told you.

957
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,692
During the Katrina cleanup,

958
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,925
Steve got this call,

959
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:49,426
and a few coffins had been
ripped out of Lafayette Cemetery

960
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,792
[Dennis] and ended up in some
Garden District yard.

961
01:08:52,825 --> 01:08:57,059
And a cleanup worker traced some
of the serial numbers

962
01:08:57,792 --> 01:08:59,192
back to Steve.

963
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:01,426
[birds chirping]

964
01:09:01,459 --> 01:09:02,992
[Dennis] Two of them were
his parents,

965
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:05,159
and one was his
little sister Dana.

966
01:09:07,692 --> 01:09:10,992
And Dana was just a kid
when she died.

967
01:09:11,025 --> 01:09:12,925
And when we came across
her coffin,

968
01:09:12,959 --> 01:09:14,226
it had been opened by looters,

969
01:09:15,992 --> 01:09:18,292
and seeing her tiny remains,

970
01:09:18,326 --> 01:09:19,992
all I could think about was
Brianna,

971
01:09:20,025 --> 01:09:22,392
and I literally passed out.

972
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:28,792
Pfft. And when I came to
on the porch,

973
01:09:28,825 --> 01:09:30,959
Steve was asking if I was okay.

974
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:33,359
I mean, if I was okay.

975
01:09:33,392 --> 01:09:37,092
And I got up, and I was leaning
against one of those

976
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:39,992
rich assholes'
Roman columns while

977
01:09:40,025 --> 01:09:43,359
Steve watched his little sister

978
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:47,725
being dragged out in her coffin
to the truck

979
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:48,992
to join his parents.

980
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:54,625
And that was his 30th birthday.

981
01:09:55,126 --> 01:09:56,758
Hello.

982
01:09:58,825 --> 01:10:01,925

986
01:10:15,992 --> 01:10:18,126
The past was hell.

987
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,392
They tryin' to make it all look
cozy and shit.

988
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:22,025
Best part about the past

989
01:10:22,892 --> 01:10:24,792
was the music, which,

990
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:27,859
with your boy and them.

991
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:29,792
he tryin' to rock out
to Chuck Berry.

992
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:35,359
I try that, they'd put me
in jail or, or worse.

Apparently,

01:15:10,992 --> 01:15:12,392

Brianna was

when she disappeared?

No.

say that? I almost...

She knows me better than anyone,
and she hates me.

1049
01:16:32,758 --> 01:16:35,059
And she's right.

1050
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:38,725
She made an oath to love me
unconditionally and she has.

1051
01:16:39,692 --> 01:16:41,392
I made that same promise,

1052
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:44,259
and every day I wish

1053
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:47,259
I didn't hate half the music
she listens to,

or that she wore sexier
underwear,

1055
01:16:50,825 --> 01:16:52,259
that her tits were bigger,

1056
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:55,925
that she didn't sound
so happy all the time,

1057
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,292
because I think that
conspicuously happy people

1058
01:16:58,326 --> 01:17:00,159
- are dumb.
- [chuckles]

1059
01:17:03,059 --> 01:17:05,359
So I get frustrated and I,

1060
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:09,825
I start these ridiculous
arguments,

1061
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:12,059
secretly hoping that
she ends it, as if that wouldn't

1062
01:17:12,092 --> 01:17:14,725
fucking destroy me.

1063
01:17:14,758 --> 01:17:16,992
Brianna was the one thing
that was keeping us together,

1064
01:17:17,025 --> 01:17:20,959
and now she's gone, so, uh...

1065
01:17:24,392 --> 01:17:25,959
[Dennis sighs]

1066
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:33,192
Remember that trip we took to
Thailand and I...

1067
01:17:33,226 --> 01:17:36,025
I got malaria and I was
in that shitty hospital

1068
01:17:37,226 --> 01:17:38,959
and all I could think about
was her,

1069
01:17:40,725 --> 01:17:41,992
getting home to her.

1070
01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:44,825
[hip-hop music]

1071
01:17:47,092 --> 01:17:48,359
That's how I feel now.

1072
01:17:52,758 --> 01:17:54,126
She won't even look at me,

1073
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:55,625
because I'm such a fucking
asshole.

1074
01:17:59,025 --> 01:18:01,159
And I miss Brianna
so fucking much.

1075
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:06,758
[Dennis sobbing]

1076
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:12,725
[Dennis cries]

1077
01:18:12,758 --> 01:18:15,259
This is about you, Tara,
and Brianna.

1078
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:17,226
Nothing else matters.

1079
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:20,292
And just so you know,
my life sucks.

1080
01:18:20,326 --> 01:18:21,792
- [Dennis chuckles]
- Come on.

1081
01:18:21,825 --> 01:18:23,992
I'm serious, man.

1082
01:18:24,025 --> 01:18:27,392
It's no fun. You might see
James Bond,

1083
01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:29,859
but I experience
Charlie Sheen, all right?

1084
01:18:29,892 --> 01:18:31,326
[chuckles]

1085
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:33,292
What you and Tara have,

1086
01:18:33,326 --> 01:18:36,859
even with all the fights,
the ups and downs, the doubts,

1087
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:38,292
I'd take that shit
in a heartbeat.

1088
01:18:39,825 --> 01:18:41,992
I sleep around by default

1089
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:45,925
and then mourn the aspect
of myself that used to feel

1090
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:48,092
something above... fuckin'.

1091
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:53,625
But then I found out
I was dyin'.

1092
01:18:59,959 --> 01:19:01,292
My brain...

1093
01:19:02,758 --> 01:19:04,025
has a tumor.

1094
01:19:05,758 --> 01:19:09,126
And all those things
just seem trivial.

1095
01:19:10,758 --> 01:19:13,392
That there's meanin'
in the things I do have,

1096
01:19:13,426 --> 01:19:16,625
and I want to spend the time
I have preservin' 'em.

1097
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:22,092
I've been in treatment and
I found out it's workin', but...

1098
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,259
when you're starin' down
at the end,

1099
01:19:27,825 --> 01:19:32,159
you realize there are things
that are far worse than death.

1100
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:37,326
And none of those things are
what you were upset about.

1101
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:38,859
How long have you known?

1102
01:19:41,226 --> 01:19:42,658
Couple of weeks.

1103
01:19:42,692 --> 01:19:44,992
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you. It's just...

1104
01:19:45,025 --> 01:19:46,658
You know what, fuck you!

1105
01:19:46,692 --> 01:19:48,658
Look, you have a right
to be mad, all right?

1106
01:19:48,692 --> 01:19:51,259
But you understand why it hasn't
been a good time

1107
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,792
to tell you, right?

1108
01:19:53,825 --> 01:19:55,359
Look, I'm tryin' to do my best,
man.

1109
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:00,226
[sighs]

1110
01:20:03,825 --> 01:20:06,259
I was so close to making a bad
haircut joke earlier.

1111
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:07,692
[chuckles]

1112
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:13,159
[sniffs]

1113
01:20:20,259 --> 01:20:22,159
You know, it turned out
it was Tom.

1114
01:20:23,692 --> 01:20:26,025
[Dennis] Fuckin' driver
who took the morphine.

1115
01:20:26,059 --> 01:20:28,192
You probably drove him to it.

1116
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:31,192
Hey, it's not misplaced rage
if the guy's a fuckin' idiot.

1117
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,292
[chuckles]

1118
01:20:33,426 --> 01:20:35,259
[grunts]

1119
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,859
[crickets chirping]

1120
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:47,359
Ah!

1121
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:50,226
So you've really been lookin'
for the one this whole time?

1122
01:21:01,259 --> 01:21:03,992
You know the real tragedy of
meeting the love of your life?

1123
01:21:06,459 --> 01:21:09,159
If it's happened,
it's behind you.

1124
01:21:11,259 --> 01:21:12,292
It's not gonna happen again.

1125
01:21:14,892 --> 01:21:16,725
And although it's wonderful,

1126
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:19,992
what's ahead of you,
it's really, really hard.

1127
01:21:27,426 --> 01:21:29,658
You know, about that
treatment thing,

1128
01:21:32,092 --> 01:21:34,925
I decided to put it on pause.

1129
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:36,159
- There's somethin' that came up,
- What are you talking about?

1130
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:37,226
- You're going to fucking chemo.
- Something, look, something

1131
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,658
came up that's really important
that I have to do.

1132
01:21:39,692 --> 01:21:41,825
Then do it in chemo, bitch!

1133
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:44,658
You know the difference between
your life and mine?

1134
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:46,658
Do you wanna know what
the difference really is?

1135
01:21:46,692 --> 01:21:47,825
What?

1136
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:53,159
Random events, chance, and luck

1137
01:21:55,259 --> 01:21:57,192
Now, some people might think
it's God or the universe

1138
01:21:57,226 --> 01:22:00,092
or what the fuck ever,

1139
01:22:01,892 --> 01:22:03,326
but that's what it is.

1140
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,725
[crickets chirps]

1141
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,992
Let's go see my family.

1142
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:14,925
I wanna show y'all somethin'

1143
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:25,625
[suspenseful music]

1144
01:22:36,692 --> 01:22:38,992
[Steve] There are things
worse than death.

[whimpers]

1147
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,326
Shit.

1148
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:54,559
Right.

1149
01:22:54,593 --> 01:22:58,192
Listen, I would do anything
to get her back, but this is...

1150
01:22:58,226 --> 01:23:01,658
I know it's kangaroo shit loony,
I know, but we gotta try.

1151
01:23:01,692 --> 01:23:04,126
I'm not saying we shouldn't but,

1152
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:08,126
but you made it back last time,
okay, maybe not next time.

1153
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,725
And who knows what else
it's doing to you, I mean,

1154
01:23:10,758 --> 01:23:12,658
the next dose could kill you.

1155
01:23:12,692 --> 01:23:13,925
It should be me.

1156
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:15,025
It's gotta be me.

1157
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:17,725
Look, I have the youth tumor.

1158
01:23:17,758 --> 01:23:20,059
Your pineal gland is
old as shit.

1159
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:23,059
It's literally impossible
for you.

1160
01:23:27,392 --> 01:23:29,725
[sighs]

1161
01:23:29,758 --> 01:23:34,792
Now, if you were lost in time,

1162
01:23:34,825 --> 01:23:39,758
and considering you raised her
and you guys share the same DNA,

1163
01:23:39,792 --> 01:23:42,259
let's assume that you would make
the same decision.

1164
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:45,925
What would you do?

1165
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:53,326

[Dennis sighs]

1167
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,925
I'd leave a message somewhere
permanent.

he, uh...

1172
01:24:28,692 --> 01:24:30,159
What?

1173
01:24:30,192 --> 01:24:32,859
Uh.
[sniffs]

1174
01:24:34,259 --> 01:24:36,758
It's just been... oh man,

1175
01:24:38,359 --> 01:24:40,326
if all this works out, I'll,

1176
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:42,159
I'll tell you about it someday.

1177
01:24:45,426 --> 01:24:48,025
[exhales]

1178
01:24:51,126 --> 01:24:52,625
This is delicious.

1179
01:24:56,226 --> 01:24:59,758
This dirty, shitty river,

1180
01:25:00,226 --> 01:25:01,326
this beer,

1181
01:25:03,226 --> 01:25:04,392
this time,

1182
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:07,859
wouldn't change it.

1183
01:25:11,692 --> 01:25:14,092
The clock just...

1184
01:25:14,126 --> 01:25:16,725
keeps tickin' down and
the lower that number gets,

1185
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:20,692
you realize how fucking amazing
now is.

1186
01:25:25,092 --> 01:25:27,192
The present is a miracle, bruh.

1187
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:31,326
[sighs]

1188
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:34,658
[chuckles]

1189
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:39,359
That's a pretty shitty,
misspelled,

1190
01:25:39,392 --> 01:25:41,892
unspecific message, huh?

1191
01:25:41,925 --> 01:25:43,059
[Steve] "Allways"?

1192
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:50,725
Remember that home hospice
call we had a few years back,

1193
01:25:50,758 --> 01:25:52,126
100-year-old woman,

1194
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,992
she had end-stage
kidney disease,

1195
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:58,159
all those pictures with like
Louis Armstrong and Nina Simone?

1196
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:01,658
Yeah, I remember that.

1197
01:26:01,692 --> 01:26:03,825
Well, she had this book
on her nightstand.

1198
01:26:05,692 --> 01:26:09,092
Can't remember what it was
called but something like,

1199
01:26:09,126 --> 01:26:12,292
<i>Facing Death with a Smile,</i>
or some bullshit.

1200
01:26:15,025 --> 01:26:17,392
While we were waiting for the
coroner, I thumbed through it,

1201
01:26:17,426 --> 01:26:19,126
and there's this passage about

1202
01:26:19,159 --> 01:26:21,392
how we're all most likely
to die.

1203
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,658
[Denis] Brianna, she asked me
about that,

1204
01:26:23,692 --> 01:26:26,059
and it's like a third of
us will be prolonged in a bed,

1205
01:26:26,092 --> 01:26:28,859
a third of us will be a sharp
decline in a bed,

1206
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,925
and a third of us will be a
roller coaster of organ failure,

1207
01:26:31,959 --> 01:26:36,792
again, in a bed, being treated,
and the tiniest percentage...

1208
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:37,992
is sudden death.

1209
01:26:39,226 --> 01:26:41,159
And that's our business, man.
We...

1210
01:26:42,959 --> 01:26:44,658
We're seeing
the exceptional ones.

1211
01:26:47,192 --> 01:26:49,126
That's what you told
your daughter?

1212
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:50,859
That's the most fucked up...

1213
01:26:50,892 --> 01:26:52,126
- [Steve chuckles]
- [Dennis] No, man, no, no, no.

1214
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,259
[laughs]

1215
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:56,658
What it made me realize is
that we know how it ends.

1216
01:26:58,426 --> 01:27:00,925
Mystery solved.

1217
01:27:00,959 --> 01:27:02,792
And in death,
the wild cards of fate

1218
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:05,758
are the exceptional ones.
But in life, all that

1219
01:27:05,792 --> 01:27:08,658
crazy shit that happens before
you die, there's always

1220
01:27:08,692 --> 01:27:10,159
infinite possibilities.

1221
01:27:18,226 --> 01:27:19,892
So, yeah,

1222
01:27:21,825 --> 01:27:24,192
the last thing I ever said
to her as her father

1223
01:27:24,226 --> 01:27:25,959
- was alway...
- [glass shatters]
