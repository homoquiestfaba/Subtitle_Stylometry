1
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:33,078
Attention.

2
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,853
Gentlemen...

3
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:39,596
...I want you to make sure
you're fully loaded and ready to go.

4
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:44,354
Tonight, you will encounter
steep resistance.

5
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:46,702
Not everyone will make it.

6
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:49,097
But for the ones that do...

7
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:52,560
...this will be a day long remembered.

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,140
Long remembered, sir.

9
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,718
And years after we're gone...

10
00:00:57,385 --> 00:01:02,290
...history will remember
the name Delta Ti Gamma.

11
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,274
Sir, yes, sir.
Delta Ti Gamma, sir.

12
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,863
Okay, boys...

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,335
...lock and load.

14
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:13,747
Move out.

15
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:15,722
Come on, let's move out.

16
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,797
Let's go. Move it, move it.

17
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:19,554
You going to be mice or men?

18
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:21,088
Let's go, freshmen.

19
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,467
Red leader, this is Blue leader.

20
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,803
Code word is "eminent."

21
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,038
Green leader, this is Red leader.
Civilian in sight.

22
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:33,462
Radio silent. I repeat, radio silent.

23
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:34,997
I have to get going.

24
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:36,952
Otherwise Guy
will get started without me.

25
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:39,024
Okay. See you tomorrow, Kira.

26
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:42,310
- Purple and Orange, I am on leader.
- We don't have Purple and Orange.

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,921
- Shut up.
- Make me.

28
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,274
Operation nearly compromised,
but we are a go.

29
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,467
Repeat, we are a go.

30
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:02,323
You have tried the rest,
now try the best.

31
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,394
Oh, gross.

32
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,940
Lager or light?

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,197
- Light.
- Well, then, don't stop.

34
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:18,454
Fill me up, soldier.

35
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:27,898
God.

36
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,725
Oh, God.

37
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:32,682
Greg, this is so embarrassing.

38
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,899
Fuck you, you son of a bitch.

39
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,608
If I see those pictures on the Internet,
you're a dead man, Greg.

40
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:39,404
A dead man, you hear me?

41
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:42,303
Greg, you're such an asshole.

42
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,932
I saved myself for you.

43
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,834
I did not know that one of my
pledges was going to do this.

44
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,227
I promise. I promise that I am
going to severely chastise him.

45
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:53,960
That's what I am going to do.
Chastise him.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,095
I am in.

47
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:03,076
Let me take a look at my artwork.

48
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,133
And to think they call this a hazing.

49
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:08,170
Not my best angle...

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,119
...but it will do.

51
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,566
I hate him. So stupid.

52
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,349
I hate Greg. I should have known.

53
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:23,454
Oh, my God.
My God, are you all right, Tracy?

54
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,030
I can't believe I hit you.

55
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,750
- Are you okay?
- I think so, professor.

56
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,547
Oh, I will be okay. Thanks.

57
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:31,942
Too bad.

58
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,326
You're very beautiful.

59
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,624
Sorry I have to do this to you...

60
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:50,659
...but if all goes well, you will be
up and at them in a few hours.

61
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,197
Good, no pulse.

62
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:31,931
Come on.

63
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,437
Come on.

64
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,361
Breathe.

65
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,518
Oh, shit. I don't believe it.

66
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,582
How could it have not worked?
It should have worked.

67
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:47,681
Motor functions, higher brain functions
should have all been restored.

68
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,937
This can't be. It's ridiculous.

69
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:51,989
I changed the sequence,
the base pairs.

70
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:53,807
It should work. It must work.

71
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:03,989
Even now, you hold the secrets
of eternal life within you.

72
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,942
And you hold onto them,
keeping me...

73
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:09,350
...alone.

74
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:14,002
Alone in the dark.

75
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,640
I will never be able
to bring the dead back.

76
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:32,741
My institute, all gone. Vanished.

77
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,044
It's all a foolish dream.

78
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,399
I failed.

79
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,974
I am a complete and utter failure.

80
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:55,240
You can help me save the
earth from the hell.

81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,613
Campus police, by Strug Dormitory.
Dispatch units.

82
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,148
Let's go. Let's move it.

83
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,386
So, what is it that you do, exactly,
Mr. Lancaster?

84
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:21,761
Come on, call me Jake, Alexandra.

85
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,299
Okay, Jake.

86
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,063
What is it exactly that you do?

87
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:29,173
I mean, when you're not charming
the pants off the ladies, that is.

88
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,304
I am a doctor.
A neurologist, actually.

89
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,918
Really?

90
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,161
I am surprised
you're still on the market.

91
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,603
Just haven't found the right girl.

92
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:39,998
Yet.

93
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:43,190
What about you?
Your online profile doesn't say much.

94
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,704
And all I know now
is that you are beautiful...

95
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:48,269
...with a great personality.

96
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:55,395
Phillipe, I go on break.

97
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:29,465
Hey, buddy.

98
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,957
Eat.

99
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,976
What is your problem?

100
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,085
You wanted filet mignon?

101
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:40,711
Get a job.

102
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:49,665
What is it, Jacques?

103
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:53,048
That son of a bitch bum
bite my finger.

104
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:54,056
Well, let me look at it.

105
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,093
Keep that on it, I will be right back.

106
00:09:58,195 --> 00:09:59,911
The world has gone crazy, huh?

107
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,948
Nobody like French people.

108
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,492
This entire mission
was a waste of time.

109
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,102
We lost a lot of good men out there.

110
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:37,301
Sorry, sir. I thought we were
on to something this time.

111
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:38,574
You should take a look at this.

112
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:41,812
It's a new infection.

113
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:43,652
Is this first generation?

114
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,858
Could be. Based on the reported
outbreaks to date...

115
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:50,509
...we extrapolated the point of origin.
Get me Nightingale in here right away.

116
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,968
You got it.

117
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:56,471
Ellis.

118
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:59,297
I am sorry about your brother.

119
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,142
Yeah.

120
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:03,136
Me too.

121
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,239
Excuse me just a second.
Getting paged.

122
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,650
Could be the office calling.

123
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,689
Someone needs, you know,
brain work or something.

124
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:11,572
Be right back.

125
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,762
Yeah, she's totally hot, man.

126
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,832
Every time I go with fucking dates,
they're usually heifers.

127
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:24,899
This one is a fucking babe.
She's got a great rack, too.

128
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,010
I owe you bigtime.

129
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,691
If I bag her tonight,
I will call you in the a.m.

130
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:31,599
I told her I am a fucking neurologist.

131
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,629
She bought it hook, line and sinker.

132
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,096
What happened to you?

133
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,126
You all right, Phillipe?

134
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,658
Little problem in the kitchen.

135
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:44,242
Problem? Nothing serious, I hope.

136
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:45,848
No, just that...

137
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:48,830
The chef got bit.

138
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:50,973
- Bit?
- By a homeless man.

139
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,684
Wait.

140
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:58,249
You can't go in there.

141
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,408
Alexandra, where you going?

142
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,059
What's going on?

143
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,279
You can't come back here.

144
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,933
Jacques?

145
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,389
Get away from him.

146
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:24,894
What was that thing?
What the hell happened to Jacques?

147
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:31,910
Hey, where you going?

148
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,144
Oh, I am sorry, Jake.

149
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:34,666
I am going to have to
take a rain check on dessert.

150
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,922
"Bag me by breakfast"?
Yeah, I don't think so, slick.

151
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:40,366
By the way,
what is it that you really do?

152
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:42,747
I am assistant manager...

153
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:44,904
...at Blockbuster.

154
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,830
Yeah, that would have been
my second guess.

155
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:49,972
Thanks for a lovely evening.

156
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:55,942
That was our waiter.
What's wrong with him?

157
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,580
- He looks really bad.
- Food poisoning.

158
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,034
I wouldn't recommend eating
anything out of this kitchen.

159
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,004
We already did.

160
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,379
Nightingale.

161
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,426
So, what do you
really do for a living?

162
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,705
I kill zombies.

163
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:32,227
So...

164
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:34,735
...what were you
doing here, Nightingale?

165
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,515
What do you think?

166
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:40,142
Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't be asking, now, would I?

167
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:44,194
If you must know, I was on a date.

168
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,416
You, on a date.

169
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:51,439
I don't believe it. How many times
I ask you out, you always said no.

170
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,032
- That's because you're a pig, Ellis.
- I am not a pig. Tom...

171
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,979
...was a pig.

172
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,509
Was?

173
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:05,865
He was killed last week.

174
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:09,144
At least I was the one to plant him.

175
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,958
God, Ellis...

176
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,952
I am so sorry.

177
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,864
I don't know what to say.

178
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:17,690
Don't say anything.

179
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,862
He went down fighting, both times.

180
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,555
He liked it that way.

181
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,367
We have all lost people we love.

182
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,798
Won't be the first
and certainly won't be the last.

183
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,913
I always thought
you had a thing for him.

184
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,256
Like hell I did.

185
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,684
- No offence.
- None taken.

186
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:44,338
So where are we off to?

187
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:46,318
Mobile unit, outside Sidell.

188
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:50,046
Setting up for a major op.
Casper will fill you in.

189
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:52,195
I am just supposed
to come fetch you.

190
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,608
More Hyper sapiens?

191
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,964
What do you think?

192
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,380
We have lost contact
with our forward recon patrols.

193
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,115
But before we did, they confirmed
a stage-one outbreak at a university campus.

194
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:39,737
Cuesta Verde, it's not far from here.

195
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:42,706
There could be survivors.
The truth is, we don't know yet.

196
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:45,907
But we do know, based on the analysis
of the vectoring of the disease...

197
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:48,330
...is that it could be
our ground zero for infection.

198
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,262
- First generation?
- Won't know till you get us a sample.

199
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:54,477
You will go in with Special Forces,
find any survivors...

200
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:57,009
...and retrieve a blood sample
from the Hyper sapiens...

201
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,917
...before cruise missiles
destroy the entire area at 0700.

202
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:04,989
Now, as much as we'd like to keep a lid on
this, we won't be able to for much longer.

203
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:08,475
And I don't need to tell you what will happen
if 60 Minutes gets ahold of this story.

204
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:10,584
We don't need Special Forces
for this op, sir.

205
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:12,445
AMS can handle it alone.

206
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,938
AMS cannot handle it alone.

207
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:17,354
Says who?

208
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:23,056
- Says me, kiddo.
- That's "sir" to you, sergeant major.

209
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,298
I am taking you and your men
on this mission as a courtesy...

210
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:29,033
...not a obligation.

211
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:33,258
Get in my way, you won't just be
studying the dead, you will join them.

212
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,905
Understood, sir?

213
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:38,439
Gentlemen, this mission
is too important for dick-waving.

214
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,919
I resent that, colonel.

215
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,733
This is how it's going to work.
AMS will lead the science team.

216
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,442
But you're under the jurisdiction
of Special Forces.

217
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:48,875
Now, as you know,
AMS is an international organization.

218
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,016
They want this op under the strictest
U.S. Operational command.

219
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:55,063
These instructions came to me
directly from the secretary of defence.

220
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:56,718
From him, from the chief of staff.

221
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,018
To him from the president...

222
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,474
...as instructed personally
by the vice president himself.

223
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:02,206
As such, I expect all of you...

224
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,936
...to work and play well together.
Do your country proud.

225
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,117
Yeah, sure, whatever you say, boss.

226
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:10,963
Nightingale, you're in command
of the science team.

227
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,410
Sergeant Dalton will oversee
the Special Forces.

228
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,065
You and Ellis will answer to him.
Am I understood?

229
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:18,174
- Understood, sir.
- Understood, sir.

230
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:19,466
Sergeant Dalton?

231
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,000
Got you, Colonel.

232
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:29,457
Nightingale? Find the blood sample.
I want those things eradicated.

233
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,918
And why don't you get
cleaned up first. You look like shit.

234
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,180
I am so ready to get some
payback on these fuckers.

235
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,438
What about you, Braxton?

236
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,969
Long as my favourite uncle's
checks don't bounce...

237
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,472
...I go where Sam sends me.

238
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:46,702
All I know is, why couldn't
one of them be my ex-wife?

239
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:49,879
I mean, I would love permission
to shoot her in the fucking head.

240
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:52,563
Do we really need
all this shit? I mean, really?

241
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:55,908
Body armour makes my face look fat.

242
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,835
That would be affirmative, private.

243
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,447
What, so you have never seen a woman
in her underwear before, private?

244
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:05,121
Trust me, that's the last thing
you will be thinking about come morning.

245
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:10,109
Of course, this is assuming
that you make it till morning.

246
00:18:10,415 --> 00:18:13,111
Which I got to say,
ain't looking very likely.

247
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:15,426
- Leave him alone.
- Whatever.

248
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:18,643
Just making conversation,
lieutenant.

249
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:28,791
Ever get the feeling that those AMS
greenhorns don't like us very much?

250
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,195
Nobody likes you, Bart.

251
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:38,253
How did we end up babysitting
these stuck-up sons of bitches?

252
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,316
Hey, I will take
all the backup I can get.

253
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:41,921
From the GI Joes?

254
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,156
They're soldiers.
They're trained for combat.

255
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,240
Trained to fight other people.
Other soldiers.

256
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,200
Not these things.

257
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:51,596
We're trained to fight, period.

258
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:52,935
And we have got you back.

259
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,833
Just make sure you got ours...

260
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,956
...and maybe we will all
get to grow old one day.

261
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:01,173
Or in your case, older.

262
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,855
She digs me.

263
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:06,324
Way to win friends
and influence people, Ellis.

264
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,573
I just don't think we need them.
That's all.

265
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:09,922
And I say we do.

266
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,976
What, you got
an inferiority complex now?

267
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:16,810
We started off as scientists,
researchers. Not soldiers.

268
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,155
Hey, speak for yourself.

269
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:20,052
I came from Secret Service...

270
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,470
...not Health and Human Resources
like you.

271
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:25,947
I was never a desk jockey.
I was always a fighter.

272
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:27,394
Not to mention a lover.

273
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:29,848
This war isn't about you, Ellis.

274
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:31,522
It's about us versus nature.

275
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,087
If nature wins, we're all fucked.

276
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,215
Keep giving speeches, Nightingale.
It's what you're good at.

277
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:40,499
Pride and truth, nothing to fear
but fear itself, that kind of thing.

278
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,551
Suits you. I kind of like it.

279
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,514
Gets me all hard and shit.

280
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,327
You just love the sound
of your own voice, don't you?

281
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:50,168
Pretty much, yeah.

282
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:59,176
Who's the new blood?

283
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:01,847
Rodriguez. Just transferred in.

284
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:05,514
Replacing Garza
as our demolition expert.

285
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:08,129
Well, I hope she lasts
longer than he did.

286
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:11,022
Because I would miss that ass.

287
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:16,775
I mean, when he got scragged,
it was no big loss, but her?

288
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:21,680
Now, that is a booty call
that I would not mind making.

289
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,172
You an asshole all the time, Bart?

290
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,333
Or do you take Sundays off
for good behaviour?

291
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:35,895
Hey, welcome to the team.

292
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:39,542
- I am Allison Henson.
- Private Rodriguez, lieutenant.

293
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,037
You know what?

294
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:44,423
Save "lieutenant" for parade ground.
In here, just call me Allison.

295
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,394
I am Maria.
Saw you talking to those AMS guys back there.

296
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:49,755
What were they saying?

297
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,004
Basically that we can't hack it.

298
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,134
What do you think?

299
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,434
- Can't wait to prove them wrong.
- Fuck them.

300
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,167
When it turns
into a shit-hit-the-fan situation...

301
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,906
...they will be hiding
behind our pantyhose...

302
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:06,092
...just like all the rest
of those fucking science types.

303
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:07,139
Science types?

304
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:09,601
That's what Bart calls
people who can read.

305
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:15,322
Come on, let's roll out.

306
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,788
Come on, come on, come on, ladies.

307
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:30,731
Come on, come on.

308
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,581
Hecht, Hill, you stay in the van
in case we run an Oxy-12 set.

309
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:54,484
Stay with the radio.

310
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:57,460
Everyone else, move out.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

311
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:18,745
So your men as good as they think,
sergeant major?

312
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:22,109
- That's right, kiddo.
- Ever fight these creatures?

313
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,958
They have been trained well.

314
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,767
So they have never been
in a firefight with these things.

315
00:22:27,307 --> 00:22:30,694
They don't know what it's like to look
one in the eye and pull the trigger, do they?

316
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,496
What, are you kidding me?

317
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:34,015
My team's been to hell and back.

318
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:36,408
Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq.

319
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:37,828
You name it, we have been there.

320
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,742
So when a 6-year-old girl
dressed in her Sunday finest...

321
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:44,374
...comes at them to take a bite
like they're a Quarter Pounder...

322
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:45,859
...you're telling me
they're not going to hesitate?

323
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,167
They're going to pull the trigger,
do what needs to be done?

324
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,557
Like I said: Been there, done that.

325
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,283
Now, if you don't mind,
we got work to do.

326
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,475
I don't like this, Nightingale.

327
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:06,666
I don't like this one bit.

328
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:09,158
These gung-ho Rangers are
going to get us killed...

329
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,928
...or worse.

330
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:12,496
What are you saying, Ellis?

331
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:14,298
Watch my back.

332
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:16,109
That's all I am saying.

333
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,669
Are you scared?

334
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,492
Just rather not end up
like my brother.

335
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:24,587
Thought you of all people
might be able to appreciate that...

336
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:26,712
...Nightingale.

337
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,913
I think they're gone, don't you?

338
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:37,221
Probably moved on.

339
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,116
We're not going to find
any Hyper sapiens here, nope.

340
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,664
Too late.

341
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,885
Missed all the action.

342
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,870
It's too bad, because
I was hoping for a medal out of this.

343
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:52,279
You hard as woodpecker lips, huh?

344
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,940
Only medal you're getting
is a Purple Heart.

345
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,844
And it ain't going to be for bravery.

346
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:08,858
What the hell?

347
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:28,399
Hold on a second, sergeant major.

348
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:56,412
What are they doing?

349
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:58,154
DNA scanner.

350
00:24:58,154 --> 00:24:59,895
Analyzes their blood.

351
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:07,735
I will get them plenty of blood
to analyze if they need it.

352
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:15,236
Third generation. Worthless.

353
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,261
Look at this.

354
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:22,343
What is it?

355
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:24,843
You ever seen teeth like that
on one of them?

356
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:26,961
No, I haven't.

357
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,057
Neither have I.

358
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,412
Could be they're mutating.

359
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,760
That's not good,
is it, Nightingale?

360
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,838
No.

361
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:47,078
Move on out.
Come on, let's go.

362
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,187
Not afraid of the dark,
are you, newbie?

363
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:50,774
Not if you're close.

364
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:58,248
Oh, shit.

365
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:20,629
What the hell is that?

366
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,462
Nothing, sarge, don't worry about it.

367
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:24,356
It's just a scratch. It's all right.

368
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:26,683
It's a bite. You have been bitten.

369
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:28,688
No, it's not. I am all right.
It's nothing.

370
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,538
He's been bitten.

371
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,807
We will have to put that in a
tourniquet, soldier.

372
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,221
You have to do more than that.

373
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:36,234
Medic.

374
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:41,351
Nakagawa's been injured. We need
to put his arm in a tourniquet, stat.

375
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,206
I am on it, sir.

376
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:43,532
Jesus, Dalton.

377
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:45,642
You can't put
a Band-Aid on infection.

378
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,605
He's a dead man walking,
he just doesn't know it yet.

379
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,171
Hey, hey, hey.

380
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:51,278
What do you think you're doing, kiddo?

381
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,759
What do you think she's doing?

382
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:55,267
It's the right thing to do.

383
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:03,446
We can take care of our own.
Grab him.

384
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:05,381
Sarge?
Sarge, what are you doing?

385
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,565
No, sarge, no.

386
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,315
No, sarge, no.

387
00:27:11,418 --> 00:27:12,440
Stand down, soldier.

388
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,509
- Stay still, hey.
- No, no.

389
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:20,831
Sorry, no choice, soldier.

390
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:28,210
I told you,
we take care of our own.

391
00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:44,842
- No. No, no, don't.
- Sorry, doc.

392
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:51,940
Dalton to base.

393
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:55,868
We lost Nakagawa and Braxton in
a firefight with Hyper sapiens, over.

394
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:56,974
Copy that, Hill out.

395
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:59,769
Hill, I need you and Hecht down here
to police these bodies, stat.

396
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:00,635
Let's go, ladies.

397
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,330
Campus is right over the hill, let's go.

398
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,575
Get them all?

399
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:12,540
Maybe we got them all.

400
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,926
Not fucking likely.

401
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,227
All right, listen up. I want a full sweep
of the perimeter. There could be survivors.

402
00:28:18,145 --> 00:28:20,133
All right, you guys, stay out of the shadows.
All right?

403
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,158
Keep in plain sight,
we're going to be fine.

404
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,122
Bart, you take Henson
and Rodriguez to the dormitories.

405
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:25,765
Gotcha.

406
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:27,629
O'Connor and Griffin,
you on point with me.

407
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:31,210
Ellis and Nightingale,
do whatever the hell you want.

408
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,998
Just don't get yourselves killed.

409
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:35,437
It will mean lots of paperwork,
and I hate fucking paperwork.

410
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,825
All right, come on, let's go, guys.

411
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:08,948
What is it?

412
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,860
Looks like a fraternity ring.

413
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:13,801
Might be valuable.

414
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:14,890
You're joking, right?

415
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,954
Does it look like I am joking?

416
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,287
Hello.

417
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:31,028
Well, I am sorry, darling...

418
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:33,767
...John can't come to
the phone right now.

419
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:35,830
He's dead.

420
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:42,698
Can you hear me now?

421
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:45,019
Come on, let's go.

422
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,623
What the hell is that smell?

423
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,565
They don't all use us
for bait, you know.

424
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:12,836
Sometimes they use us for dinner.

425
00:30:13,123 --> 00:30:14,077
I can see that.

426
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,638
All protein and no carbs.

427
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:26,202
You don't have
the stomach for this, Rodriguez?

428
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:27,812
Must be something I ate.

429
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:29,791
You mean more like
something they ate.

430
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,510
Come on, now.

431
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,682
Take it like a man.

432
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:33,788
Leave her alone, Bart.

433
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,044
I can take care of myself, lieutenant.

434
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,519
Whatever you say, private.

435
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:42,516
You girls ready?

436
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:48,957
Empty.

437
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:52,218
I think we took them all out.

438
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:53,968
We did it, man.

439
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:55,371
We did it.

440
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,585
O'Connor, kill that chatter.
Let's fan out.

441
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,730
All the buildings...

442
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:39,485
...connect through
the subterranean tunnels.

443
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:43,287
This entire university's
honeycomb-ville.

444
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:45,953
We don't need to
lock this place down.

445
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:49,207
We just need to find your Hyper sapien
and get the hell out of Dodge.

446
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:53,013
This certainly explains how the Hyper sapiens
have been getting around.

447
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,599
They have been following the same patterns,

448
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,794
habits that they had
while they were still alive.

449
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:01,848
Except with a much bigger appetite.

450
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:03,169
Clear.

451
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:06,206
Clear.

452
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,640
Man, I love books.

453
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,883
Anton Chekhov, Feodor Dostoyevsky,
Judy Blume.

454
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:16,542
You know what I was reading?
Insane is the new sexy.

455
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,593
Give it a rest, man.

456
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,303
Hey, do you name your weapon?

457
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:21,589
You should, because it's
your best friend out here.

458
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:25,314
- My weapon's name is Sophie. Sophie Stein.
- O'Connor. O'Connor, can it.

459
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:27,638
And my side arm's name
is Tough Love.

460
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:30,845
Enough, O'Connor. I got it.

461
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:36,623
Holy shit.

462
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,343
We got a survivor.

463
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:41,999
You don't know that.
Could be one of them.

464
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:42,835
Hey...

465
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,898
...zombies don't read.
And they ain't hooked on phonics.

466
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:46,887
So give it a rest.

467
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,513
Hey, kid.

468
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,155
- He's got headphones on.
- Hey, kid, can you hear me?

469
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,757
Come on, kid, you're pissing me off.

470
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,553
Careful.

471
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:06,985
O'Connor, this ain't my first rodeo...

472
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,618
...and zombies don't read.

473
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,773
Unbelievable.

474
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,256
Come on, kid.

475
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:22,932
Fucking zombie geek.

476
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:31,295
Son of a...

477
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,509
Sorry about the noise.

478
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:45,485
Let's move out, form on me.

479
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:49,253
Come on.

480
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,432
Let's go before them
bombs start dropping.

481
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:55,438
If I told her one time,
I told her a thousand times...

482
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:58,053
- Voices.
- Survivors.

483
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:01,600
So, like, we had sex that one time,
and after that...

484
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,378
...she only wanted to be friends.

485
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:05,749
I mean, she practically
threw herself at me.

486
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:08,927
Hello. Can you hear me in there?

487
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:10,250
Dude. It was a one-time thing.

488
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,404
Hey, you crummy teens...

489
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:13,794
...open the fucking door.

490
00:34:13,794 --> 00:34:15,059
You're about to have sex with...

491
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,763
We're coming in, stay down.

492
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,688
Three, two, one.

493
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,628
The problem, it sounds to me that
you were a little...

494
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:23,188
...underwhelming in the sack.
Shit.

495
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:24,963
Oh, man, now I get...

496
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,896
...we will be joined by celebrities,
Clint Howard...

497
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,373
God, I can't believe
this is happening.

498
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:40,685
Oh, don't go all girly on me now.

499
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:43,630
Jesus Christ, it's like you two
haven't seen a dead body before.

500
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:46,341
What the hell are you doing, Bart?

501
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:51,509
Well, it seems that our
unfortunate friend here was named...

502
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,641
...Guy Woodhouse.

503
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:56,603
I guess he won't have to
worry about finals anymore.

504
00:34:56,603 --> 00:34:57,917
Adios, Senor Woodhouse.

505
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:01,676
Well, lookie here.

506
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:05,038
I don't want this.

507
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:06,382
I am not giving it to you...

508
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,438
...I just want you to take a picture.

509
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:10,616
Picture of what?

510
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,259
Of me...

511
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:19,748
...and my new girlfriend.

512
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,612
Okay? Go ahead, we're ready.

513
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:24,464
Ready for what?

514
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:29,762
Take the picture.

515
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:31,106
No fucking way.

516
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:34,505
Fine. I will do it.

517
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,017
Don't you dare.

518
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:39,453
You know, I bet she was a looker
when she was alive.

519
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:40,927
Right?

520
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:43,673
I mean, she's not
too bad now, either.

521
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,216
I'd stick my dick in her but...

522
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,221
...I am afraid of
what would happen.

523
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,540
You're fucking disgusting.

524
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,624
You don't look fat, okay?

525
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,920
We really make a nice couple.

526
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,152
Don't you think?

527
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:15,357
Clear.

528
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:40,338
O'Connor.

529
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:44,355
O'Connor.

530
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:57,935
Second generation.

531
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,713
Close, but no cigar.

532
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:02,143
- It doesn't mean anything.
- We will see.

533
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:05,928
I know it's not very scientific,
but I follow my nose...

534
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,251
...and my nose tells me
we're getting close.

535
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,020
You sure you could develop
a serum from this?

536
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,742
Well, not me.
I am just a grunt like you...

537
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:18,148
...but AMS has some pretty
brilliant minds working for them.

538
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:20,204
Like Nightingale here.

539
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:23,635
They believe if they get DNA
from a first-generation zombie...

540
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:26,474
...generation zero,
they can create an antibody.

541
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:29,942
That way we can stop playing catch-up and
actually end this plague once and for all.

542
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,897
It's not different from
whooping cough or smallpox.

543
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:36,843
Really, it's just a matter of
inoculating people against it.

544
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,243
If we're lucky, the zombie plague will
end up a footnote in the history books.

545
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:44,929
No worse than AIDS
or bubonic plague.

546
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:48,073
Yeah, if it's all
the same to you, Nightingale...

547
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,334
...I'd rather you not refer to Tom
as a footnote.

548
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,428
What's the bug up his ass?

549
00:38:01,428 --> 00:38:03,777
He lost his brother
on a mission last week.

550
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:05,575
Yeah, well, we all lose people.

551
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:09,904
Yeah, but your people don't usually get back
up and take a bite out of you after they die.

552
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:14,631
Careful, you can infect yourself.

553
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:17,270
You sure as hell wouldn't
want that, would you?

554
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,141
No, we wouldn't.

555
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,579
Although...

556
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:24,059
...if I did have to eat anyone...

557
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,213
...I'd definitely pick you, kiddo.

558
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:30,536
Don't worry, if you die...

559
00:38:30,536 --> 00:38:33,302
...I will be sure to shoot you
in the head before you get to.

560
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:36,171
That's too bad.
A tightass like you...

561
00:38:36,171 --> 00:38:38,473
...probably enjoy being eaten by me.

562
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,684
Say "cheese."

563
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:48,236
Don't you think we should continue
looking for survivors, sir?

564
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:49,825
Absolutely.

565
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,842
But first, Lieutenant Henson, don't you
want your Kodak moment with them?

566
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:57,112
That's all right,
I think I will take a pass.

567
00:38:57,112 --> 00:38:58,845
Well, it's your call, but...

568
00:38:58,845 --> 00:39:02,512
...I got to tell you, I think you'd make
a mint with these things on eBay.

569
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:08,444
- I am wondering about something.
- What is it?

570
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,753
Well, it's just that if these two were locked
up in here and there's no sign of forced entry

571
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:15,953
how'd she get infected?
That's a good question.

572
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:20,270
And my answer to that is,
"Who gives a fuck."

573
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,165
But if she didn't have contact
with another person, my worry is...

574
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:25,098
...could the infection
have gone airborne?

575
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:27,968
AMS said there's no sign of
this infection being spread airborne.

576
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:30,484
AMS has their heads
up their asses, okay?

577
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:33,216
That's why we do
their dirty work for them.

578
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:37,700
If they knew what they were doing,
they would have invented a vaccine by now...

579
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,546
...and they would have had
a full containment unit on this thing.

580
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:43,884
I am just saying...

581
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:46,709
- What is it?
- It's...

582
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:50,084
It's nothing. It's just a...

583
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:52,793
...mosquito bite, I think.

584
00:39:53,254 --> 00:39:54,176
No way.

585
00:39:58,835 --> 00:39:59,892
Oh, shit.

586
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:19,744
Sarge, I think I heard something.

587
00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:21,267
Keep moving, soldier.

588
00:40:27,464 --> 00:40:28,624
Sarge, somebody's up there.

589
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,473
Stow that shit and keep moving.

590
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:32,841
Sarge, somebody's up there.

591
00:40:44,947 --> 00:40:45,890
Shit.

592
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:04,157
Hey. Hey, wait up.

593
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:12,804
Hey, wait.

594
00:41:30,523 --> 00:41:31,509
Hello?

595
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:36,463
Hello?

596
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,502
I know you're in here.
You don't have to be afraid.

597
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:42,406
I am coming to get you out.

598
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,958
It's going to be all right. Okay.

599
00:41:46,444 --> 00:41:48,974
I am going to get you right out of here.
It's going to be okay.

600
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:51,701
I am going to get you home.

601
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:55,007
You will be all right.

602
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:57,034
It's going to be all over.

603
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:02,607
Oh, God...

604
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,027
What are we going to do?
We can't just leave him here.

605
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:24,320
We can't take him with us.

606
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,866
You got to take me to base camp.

607
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:26,861
He could turn at any time.

608
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,865
Maybe they found the zero sample.

609
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:32,703
You know, maybe they can...

610
00:43:32,703 --> 00:43:34,729
What? Do what? Cure you?

611
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:37,023
- You know that's not going to happen.
- Maybe...

612
00:43:37,538 --> 00:43:39,848
...it can't be transmitted
by mosquitoes.

613
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:42,171
Maybe it was something else.

614
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:45,799
Maybe they were already infected
before they came into the room.

615
00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:52,566
Can't take that chance, Bart.

616
00:43:55,986 --> 00:43:56,523
Here.

617
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,572
What's this for?

618
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,129
You know what it's for.

619
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:02,033
Use it...

620
00:44:06,288 --> 00:44:07,900
...soon as you start to feel
the change coming.

621
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:10,448
What, are you insane?

622
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:13,446
I am not going to fucking kill myself.

623
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:14,697
Then I will do it for you.

624
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:16,901
Put the gun down.

625
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:18,207
You got to take me with you.

626
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:20,516
You can't leave me here.

627
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:22,150
Listen, Bart...

628
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,613
...you're endangering
our entire mission.

629
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:26,017
We're wasting time.

630
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:30,199
I will give you each
a half a million dollars...

631
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:32,316
...if you take me with you.

632
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:34,865
That's $500,000 apiece.

633
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:38,590
What do you say, Rodriguez?

634
00:44:39,465 --> 00:44:43,530
Pretty young thing like you.
You don't want to live your whole life...

635
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,104
...on the crap that Uncle Sam
doles out to grunts like us, do you?

636
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:52,467
Five hundred thousand bucks
can buy a lot of shit.

637
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,641
You could be living it up
Robin Leach-style.

638
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:59,303
Where you going to get
that kind of money?

639
00:44:59,303 --> 00:45:00,815
Pharmaceutical company.

640
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:05,772
If we get the zero matter
to them, before AMS...

641
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:08,004
...they're going to pay us millions.

642
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:12,930
I mean, can you imagine what the
patent on this drug is going to be worth?

643
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,400
How much Goldman
is going to be willing to pay?

644
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,896
Now, Dalton is in it with me,
and you two can be in it with us too.

645
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:23,448
There's going to be enough
to go around for everybody.

646
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,106
Private, what the hell are you doing?

647
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:31,920
- You can't be serious.
- Hell, yeah.

648
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,339
Have you looked at
your paycheque lately?

649
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:36,478
Sounds like a good deal to me.

650
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:45,395
Never underestimate
the power of human greed...

651
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:47,191
...Lieutenant Henson.

652
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:53,217
You didn't think I'd sell out our country
for this piece of shit, did you?

653
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,112
Should have known better.

654
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:56,862
Now, what are we
going to do with him, ma'am?

655
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:01,451
We're going to let him rot here
with the rest of them.

656
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,590
Where's Griffin?

657
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:10,128
He was right behind us.

658
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:11,815
Was. Not anymore.

659
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:13,895
Man, I told him to keep up.

660
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:15,252
Got to move...

661
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:16,863
Shit.

662
00:46:22,302 --> 00:46:23,291
Jesus.

663
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:32,075
Look at this.

664
00:46:37,182 --> 00:46:39,800
They must have lured the zombies
into the cage...

665
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,205
...and got bitten in the process.
Shot themselves before they turned.

666
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:44,296
Smart.

667
00:46:48,094 --> 00:46:49,242
They can smell us.

668
00:46:51,565 --> 00:46:53,239
This cage isn't going to
hold them forever.

669
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:55,072
We should get the hell out of here.

670
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,066
Remember, I give the orders.

671
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:58,791
Go ahead.

672
00:46:59,675 --> 00:47:00,995
Order away.

673
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:04,056
This cage ain't going to
hold them forever.

674
00:47:04,056 --> 00:47:05,820
Let's move out of here.
Let's get moving. Come on.

675
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:12,778
Ugly son of a bitch.

676
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,636
Sergeant major, get down.

677
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,118
I am okay, I am okay.

678
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:47,286
- No, you're not. You're infected.
- I am okay, I am okay.

679
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:51,405
He's turning.

680
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:54,490
No, I am not turning, I am fine.

681
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,284
Stand back. O'Connor.

682
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:01,353
- Stay back, sarge.
- Stand down.

683
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:05,221
I don't want to do this.

684
00:48:19,422 --> 00:48:20,897
Oh, God...

685
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,060
...they got the sarge, man.

686
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,873
Not the sarge. They got the sarge...

687
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:33,357
Don't know why I am even bothering
with the gun.

688
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:36,663
It's not like he actually has
the balls to use it.

689
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:43,088
Sure you don't want
a picture with him?

690
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,264
If they can get the sarge,
they can get anybody.

691
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,510
Man was the best soldier
I have ever seen.

692
00:49:05,377 --> 00:49:07,266
All right, we got to get the fuck
out of here.

693
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,368
Let's move.

694
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:17,537
Damn.

695
00:49:18,043 --> 00:49:19,201
We got to go back.

696
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,433
Right.

697
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:29,868
I don't want to be one of them, man.
We got to bug out.

698
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:32,021
Hey, we got the guns, they don't.

699
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:35,405
Ellis?

700
00:49:36,242 --> 00:49:37,309
Look sharp.

701
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:08,147
Reload.

702
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,745
So that's why they're evolving.
To chew through our armour.

703
00:50:25,504 --> 00:50:27,662
- What do we do?
- Only thing we can do:

704
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:28,713
Run like hell.

705
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:37,127
Can't go back that way.

706
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:39,604
We will have to go around.
Base, this is Ellis, over.

707
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:42,220
Base, this is Ellis, over.

708
00:50:43,057 --> 00:50:44,798
We need extraction, over.

709
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:47,452
Guess we're on our own.

710
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,173
This is not good.

711
00:51:14,173 --> 00:51:15,519
No, it's not.

712
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:23,643
I have an idea.

713
00:51:57,005 --> 00:52:00,007
There is a part two
to this plan, right?

714
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:01,572
Stay off the floor.

715
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,257
Not bad.

716
00:52:13,742 --> 00:52:15,494
Don't ask me to do it again.

717
00:52:18,546 --> 00:52:19,638
I will go get the radio.

718
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:21,096
Warn base about Dalton and Bart.

719
00:52:22,868 --> 00:52:25,027
Hecht, you okay?

720
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,728
They came from out of nowhere.
So fast.

721
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:31,355
They destroyed the radio.

722
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:33,521
They're so fast.

723
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:35,469
So fast.

724
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:38,713
Don't open the door.

725
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:51,599
Have you been bitten?

726
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,662
Shit.

727
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:02,953
I will wait.

728
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:05,470
Don't wait.

729
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:43,898
Much better.

730
00:53:44,538 --> 00:53:45,216
Yeah.

731
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:47,767
But I can't see your nipples now.

732
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:50,053
You really are a pig,
aren't you, Ellis?

733
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:52,700
Well, maybe a little bit.

734
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:56,953
Hey, can I ask you something?
If it's not too personal or anything.

735
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:58,012
Yeah, sure. What is it?

736
00:53:58,966 --> 00:54:01,069
Why do they call you "Nightingale"?

737
00:54:01,577 --> 00:54:02,576
It's a long story.

738
00:54:02,932 --> 00:54:04,061
Ah, come on.

739
00:54:04,936 --> 00:54:07,253
Not likely I will make it to
the big finish anyhow and.....

740
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:09,640
....it's just always kind of bugged me.

741
00:54:12,254 --> 00:54:13,849
"I get it."

742
00:54:14,214 --> 00:54:16,740
Goody two-shoes,
always helping people in need.

743
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,719
Real Florence Nightingale type.

744
00:54:20,378 --> 00:54:22,618
All right. You ready?

745
00:54:24,229 --> 00:54:26,700
Couple of years ago,
I was in the Peace Corps.

746
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,057
Right out of med school.

747
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,152
Working in Africa.

748
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:33,006
Small village, good people.

749
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:35,325
One day everybody started
getting sick.

750
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:37,758
Wasn't AIDS or anything.

751
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,306
Wasn't like anything
we'd ever seen before.

752
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:43,329
Blood coming out of every orifice.

753
00:54:45,384 --> 00:54:46,835
We set up a medevac.

754
00:54:46,835 --> 00:54:49,252
Tended to the dead and dying
as best we could.

755
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:53,834
I didn't eat, didn't even sleep, 24/7.

756
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:57,134
Team from NSA came in.

757
00:54:57,844 --> 00:55:00,624
Wanted us to try a vaccine they created.

758
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,325
At that point, I would have done
anything to stop their suffering.

759
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:06,028
It did.

760
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,976
Then they woke up.

761
00:55:11,023 --> 00:55:12,279
They weren't alive.

762
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,255
They were dead,
but they were still walking.

763
00:55:16,282 --> 00:55:17,555
So I only had one choice.

764
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:21,023
I grabbed a machine gun
and I started firing.

765
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:24,954
Must have killed a hundred
of them, maybe more.

766
00:55:25,616 --> 00:55:27,368
I lost count after a while.

767
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:30,207
I killed them all.

768
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:33,132
They were all dead.

769
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:36,468
The men, the women, children.

770
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,214
Want to know why they call me
Nightingale?

771
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:43,965
That's when it started.

772
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:46,052
As a sick joke.

773
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,929
It stuck ever since.

774
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:53,807
Okay, then.

775
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,041
What do you say we get
the hell out of here?

776
00:55:58,949 --> 00:56:00,768
Yeah, let's.

777
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:07,142
All right.

778
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:10,012
Map said this was the oldest building
on the campus.

779
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:11,807
GPS says it's the science building.

780
00:56:11,807 --> 00:56:13,187
Sounds like a good place to start.

781
00:56:13,187 --> 00:56:14,561
All right.

782
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,631
Where the hell are we?

783
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:01,028
My last mag.

784
00:57:07,595 --> 00:57:09,704
- This must be the science lab.
- Yeah, you think?

785
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:18,908
You don't think these things have
learned to shoot, do you?

786
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:20,672
No, I sure as hell don't.

787
00:57:22,111 --> 00:57:23,247
Hold your fire.

788
00:57:23,766 --> 00:57:25,747
We're a medical-research team.

789
00:57:25,747 --> 00:57:26,791
We're here to help.

790
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:29,037
Okay, right.

791
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:33,081
Well, unless they have learned
to talk too, I think we're in luck.

792
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:36,587
Alex, you're bleeding.

793
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,825
We don't have time for this.

794
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,969
I am Dr. Alexandra Morgan, AMS.

795
00:57:54,969 --> 00:57:56,513
This is Lieutenant Ellis.

796
00:57:56,897 --> 00:57:59,378
Lonny, Lonny Evans.

797
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,148
This is my girlfriend, Sarah.

798
00:58:02,974 --> 00:58:04,970
Yeah, where'd you get
the firepower, kids?

799
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:07,818
Campus cop.

800
00:58:08,984 --> 00:58:09,743
He...

801
00:58:11,185 --> 00:58:16,089
He gave it to us right before he,
you know, bought the farm.

802
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:17,777
How long you guys
been down here?

803
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:19,036
I don't know.

804
00:58:20,786 --> 00:58:24,179
Couple days, maybe? Like a week.

805
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:28,231
We have been living off these chocolate
PowerBars since it started.

806
00:58:28,231 --> 00:58:29,099
Since what started?

807
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:30,655
Everything.

808
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,843
Those things,
are they still out there?

809
00:58:35,688 --> 00:58:36,656
I am afraid they are.

810
00:58:36,656 --> 00:58:38,613
Where are we, exactly?

811
00:58:38,613 --> 00:58:41,835
It's... It's one of the
university research labs.

812
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:44,868
Lonny and I were teaching assistants
for Professor Curien...

813
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:45,965
...when it all went down.

814
00:58:45,965 --> 00:58:47,782
When what went down?

815
00:58:49,465 --> 00:58:50,800
They don't know.

816
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,426
The infection.

817
00:58:52,426 --> 00:58:54,275
This is where it all started.

818
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:58,454
The first zombie was created here.
How?

819
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:02,530
He created a DNA sequencer that
scanned the human genome and...

820
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,441
...it genetically reassembled
the chromosomes...

821
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,724
...in a person's molecular makeup
in order to create mitosis...

822
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:10,643
Whoa, whoa, sweetie.
You're going a little over my head.

823
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,933
The professor was trying to
bring back the dead.

824
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,290
They found out he was
stealing corpses...

825
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,715
...for his experiments from
the hospital morgue.

826
00:59:21,715 --> 00:59:24,039
When they stopped that, he...

827
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:27,077
He just continued with
his experiments.

828
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:31,259
Okay. But where did the sequencer
come from?

829
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:33,364
Her.

830
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:54,027
The professor's son, Rudy,
and his girlfriend...

831
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:57,886
...came back here a few months ago,
but she was different somehow.

832
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:01,947
Changed. She killed his son,
but Curien kept her chained up here...

833
01:00:01,947 --> 01:00:04,838
...convinced her blood held the key
to eternal life.

834
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:08,680
Personally,
I just thought he was a pervert.

835
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:18,002
Where's Rudy, professor?

836
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:22,006
Doctor Curien, please,
you have to help me.

837
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:30,989
So that's it.

838
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:33,923
Generation zero.
The first Hyper sapien.

839
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,247
Of course.

840
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:38,119
The Isla del Muerte incident.

841
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:40,439
They were both taken into custody
by AMS...

842
01:00:40,727 --> 01:00:43,754
...but showed no signs of infection,
so they were released.

843
01:00:43,754 --> 01:00:47,577
Now, who are you people,
and where the hell is Rudy?

844
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,403
Let me see if I have this right.
There was a crazy German priest.

845
01:00:50,403 --> 01:00:52,537
- Spanish.
- Spanish priest.

846
01:00:52,537 --> 01:00:54,733
He impaled you through the heart,
killing you.

847
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:59,028
And your boyfriend Rudy brought you
back to life with an immortality serum.

848
01:00:59,919 --> 01:01:01,977
That's the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

849
01:01:01,977 --> 01:01:03,895
Why don't you tell me what
really happened.

850
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:06,682
I don't get it, man.

851
01:01:07,273 --> 01:01:08,600
What's the big deal?

852
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,975
The big deal is, if we can get
a sample of her blood...

853
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:15,206
...we might just be able to synthesize
an antidote for the infection.

854
01:01:17,379 --> 01:01:18,840
I can open the door.

855
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:55,734
You get it?

856
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,371
- Yep.
- Sweetheart...

857
01:01:59,659 --> 01:02:01,310
...I could kiss you right now.

858
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,254
Time for tongue acrobatics later.

859
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:06,083
Right now, we got what we came for.
Let's get out of here.

860
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:10,841
Oh, shit.

861
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,136
Sarah, behind you.

862
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,460
Sometimes a mind
isn't a terrible thing to waste.

863
01:02:44,197 --> 01:02:46,176
The missiles are on their way, Ellis.

864
01:02:48,604 --> 01:02:50,789
How the fuck are we going to
get out of here?

865
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:51,830
We're trapped.

866
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:55,750
We better figure out something,
or this is going to become...

867
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:59,840
...our permanent residence in about
14 minutes and 20 seconds.

868
01:03:35,467 --> 01:03:37,847
Help. Help me.

869
01:03:41,592 --> 01:03:42,855
Please.

870
01:03:56,091 --> 01:03:58,127
- I am almost out.
- Me too.

871
01:03:59,012 --> 01:04:02,418
- We did not come this far to fail now.
- Drop dead.

872
01:04:48,891 --> 01:04:50,357
Ellis, take the vial.

873
01:04:51,357 --> 01:04:52,279
There.

874
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:54,363
Grab this. Hold on.

875
01:05:13,206 --> 01:05:14,984
I see the van.

876
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:22,833
Come on.

877
01:06:07,016 --> 01:06:10,168
- No.
- God.

878
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:18,818
We have to go back.

879
01:06:18,818 --> 01:06:19,991
What are you, crazy?

880
01:06:20,613 --> 01:06:21,333
Why?

881
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:24,598
We had a zero sample, but I lost it.

882
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:28,121
Cruise missiles are going to level this
entire area in less than 10 minutes.

883
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:30,287
We don't have time.
Even if we did, there's too many of them.

884
01:06:30,816 --> 01:06:31,801
I don't care.

885
01:06:32,475 --> 01:06:33,503
We have to try.

886
01:06:34,101 --> 01:06:35,321
I can't allow it.

887
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:38,825
And with the rest of the team dead,
I am sorry. I am in charge.

888
01:06:38,825 --> 01:06:41,036
Well, I am not leaving without
what we came here for.

889
01:06:44,395 --> 01:06:47,181
Are you absolutely sure that's
the right material you had?

890
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:49,246
We're sure.

891
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,503
If our radio hadn't been destroyed,
we would be able to call off the air strike

892
01:06:53,503 --> 01:06:55,383
but we have lost all communication with HQ.

893
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:58,895
Look, every minute we waste talking
about it is a minute we lose.

894
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:00,180
If we're going to go back, we go now.

895
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,216
Back, back into the lab we get the zero sample,
and that way, all of this hasn't been for nothing.

896
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,496
Let me ask you a question,
lieutenant.

897
01:07:10,643 --> 01:07:11,910
You got a brother?

898
01:07:32,663 --> 01:07:33,982
All right, boys and girls.

899
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:35,505
It's the fourth quarter.

900
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:38,245
Down by 21...

901
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:40,618
...and the clock is ticking.

902
01:07:40,618 --> 01:07:42,399
Okay, Knute Rockne.

903
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:47,255
Guys?

904
01:07:52,355 --> 01:07:53,274
Fuck.

905
01:08:03,552 --> 01:08:05,211
On me. Let's go.

906
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,303
We got to move.

907
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:05,796
Well, we found the gym.

908
01:09:46,152 --> 01:09:47,627
Nice shooting, lieutenant.

909
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:51,281
Don't tell me we made a wrong turn.

910
01:09:51,281 --> 01:09:53,791
I am making this up
as I go along, Alex.

911
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,155
If you have got a better idea,
I am all ears.

912
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:58,495
Door's not going to hold forever, guys.

913
01:09:58,495 --> 01:10:00,249
Not to mention we're running out of time.

914
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:00,956
Look at this.

915
01:10:10,714 --> 01:10:12,278
We can't open the grate
from this side.

916
01:10:14,057 --> 01:10:15,032
What do we do?

917
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:17,478
We improvise.

918
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:23,348
I bet it'd be easier to open that grate
from the other side.

919
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:24,247
I am sure you could.

920
01:10:25,068 --> 01:10:27,554
But getting to the other side
is the reaI trick, now, isn't it?

921
01:10:27,554 --> 01:10:29,018
Here's what I suggest.

922
01:10:29,306 --> 01:10:33,050
We go out that door,
down around the stairs to the right...

923
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:34,432
...up to the hallway.

924
01:10:34,432 --> 01:10:37,832
That should take me to the corridor
leading to the science building...

925
01:10:37,832 --> 01:10:39,911
...which should theoretically put me...

926
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:44,724
...right outside that grate.

927
01:10:44,969 --> 01:10:46,342
Are you crazy?

928
01:10:46,918 --> 01:10:49,221
What about
all the Hyper sapiens out there?

929
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:53,061
I have got an idea about that too.

930
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,839
Give me your knife.

931
01:11:09,938 --> 01:11:13,155
It's like the gels we used to use
to train attack dogs.

932
01:11:13,871 --> 01:11:15,538
They will think I am one of them.

933
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:21,315
That way I will go up
and open the grate.

934
01:11:21,315 --> 01:11:22,589
Are you crazy?

935
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:24,875
Yeah, he's crazy, all right.

936
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:31,726
What are you doing?

937
01:11:34,015 --> 01:11:37,225
I can't take any weapons.
They smell gunpowder.

938
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:42,914
Just because
it's your turn to have an idea...

939
01:11:42,914 --> 01:11:45,032
...doesn't mean you can't wait
for a good one.

940
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:49,712
Keep it.

941
01:11:49,712 --> 01:11:50,602
It's your lucky knife.

942
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:51,207
I know.

943
01:11:52,634 --> 01:11:54,317
Just make sure you bring it back.

944
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:56,938
Okay, Steven?

945
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,458
What the fuck was I thinking?

946
01:12:49,505 --> 01:12:51,508
Dumbest move
I ever saw anybody make.

947
01:12:54,196 --> 01:12:55,215
Hell of a soldier.

948
01:12:57,068 --> 01:12:58,938
Not too hard on the eyes, either.

949
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:03,691
Hope he makes it back OK.
I wouldn't mind asking him out.

950
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,282
That is, unless you.....

951
01:13:31,943 --> 01:13:33,264
This door's going to give, Alex.

952
01:13:33,648 --> 01:13:36,957
In a few minutes, we're going to have
some very unwelcome guests for supper.

953
01:13:39,304 --> 01:13:42,005
If you're going to do this, Ellis,
you better do it now.

954
01:13:59,336 --> 01:14:00,098
That's good.

955
01:14:03,377 --> 01:14:04,522
Where the hell's Ellis?

956
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,705
Ellis ain't coming.

957
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:16,709
Don't be so sure.

958
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:25,665
Short, controlled bursts.
Conserve your ammo.

959
01:14:27,269 --> 01:14:28,481
You will need it.

960
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:42,614
Alex, Henson,
get your asses out here.

961
01:14:59,448 --> 01:15:00,952
Alex, come on.

962
01:15:10,713 --> 01:15:11,771
Alex.

963
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:20,243
Come on.

964
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,573
Shit.

965
01:15:52,603 --> 01:15:54,606
The lab's just around the corner.

966
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:56,554
We can still make it.

967
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:13,031
Alex.

968
01:17:02,829 --> 01:17:04,250
Get the damn sample.

969
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:25,945
How much time do we have left
till the missiles hit?

970
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:27,824
Minutes. Maybe less.

971
01:17:27,824 --> 01:17:28,982
Here.

972
01:17:33,379 --> 01:17:36,265
Got it. Let's go.

973
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:44,523
Come on, Henson.
We will carry you the rest of the way.

974
01:17:44,523 --> 01:17:46,914
I am not going anywhere,
you know that.

975
01:17:47,641 --> 01:17:50,172
- Maybe we can...
- What?

976
01:17:50,172 --> 01:17:51,901
Reverse the disease?

977
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,840
Come on.

978
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:56,427
I know it's over.

979
01:17:56,427 --> 01:18:00,165
Just do me a favour
and get that blood...

980
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:02,166
...to people who can do
some good with it, okay?

981
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:05,043
Make sure no one else
has to end up like me.

982
01:18:05,777 --> 01:18:06,835
Make me that promise.

983
01:18:08,408 --> 01:18:09,701
Yeah, of course.

984
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:14,329
You-- You got to move.

985
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:17,976
Come on,
I got like a minute of life left.

986
01:18:17,976 --> 01:18:20,117
You think I want to spend it
looking at your ugly mugs?

987
01:18:28,423 --> 01:18:29,286
Hey, Ellis.

988
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:31,739
Yeah, Henson.

989
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:34,555
I got a sister.

990
01:18:42,511 --> 01:18:43,517
I will see you around, soldier.

991
01:18:44,605 --> 01:18:45,259
No.

992
01:18:47,043 --> 01:18:47,900
You won't.

993
01:19:13,218 --> 01:19:14,561
There's no time to go back.

994
01:19:15,941 --> 01:19:17,600
One last stand?

995
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:25,109
Why not.

996
01:20:05,943 --> 01:20:07,341
Alex.

997
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:09,448
Alex.

998
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:12,234
Get the hell out of here.
That's an order.

999
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,729
Whoa, hold your fire.

1000
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:51,686
Where's the rest of the team?

1001
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:53,420
I am the rest of the team.

1002
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:55,903
I am not infected.

1003
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:02,715
Things didn't go as well as planned,
but I got a sample.

1004
01:21:05,776 --> 01:21:06,951
Are you serious?

1005
01:21:06,951 --> 01:21:07,849
Yeah.

1006
01:21:09,975 --> 01:21:11,109
Give it to me.

1007
01:21:13,317 --> 01:21:13,809
Why?

1008
01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:15,528
I said, give it to me.

1009
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,738
What's wrong with you, lieutenant?

1010
01:21:23,738 --> 01:21:25,167
What's wrong with me?

1011
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:29,913
You know what it's like
to cut off your own hand?

1012
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:36,138
Watching the tendons snap...

1013
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:38,630
...the marrow of the bone...

1014
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:42,310
...the pain.

1015
01:21:43,147 --> 01:21:46,522
The horrible, excruciating agony.

1016
01:21:46,522 --> 01:21:49,214
And the blood, wow.

1017
01:21:49,524 --> 01:21:53,612
Watching it pump out of your body...

1018
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,320
...and pour across the floor.

1019
01:21:58,605 --> 01:22:03,906
Wondering when it will be
that you will lose consciousness...

1020
01:22:03,906 --> 01:22:08,527
...and if you will ever wake up again.

1021
01:22:08,527 --> 01:22:12,710
But I knew I had to do something,
you know...

1022
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,949
...otherwise I'd end up dead.

1023
01:22:18,196 --> 01:22:19,546
Dead like them.

1024
01:22:21,849 --> 01:22:23,130
You were bit.

1025
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:33,815
By a mosquito.

1026
01:22:40,268 --> 01:22:41,240
Not enough blood...

1027
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:46,575
...for it to happen
as quickly as by a human bite.

1028
01:22:46,575 --> 01:22:52,344
But, you know,
it would have happened eventually...

1029
01:22:53,472 --> 01:22:55,428
...if I hadn't...

1030
01:23:01,117 --> 01:23:02,285
...done something.

1031
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,696
Listen, Bart.

1032
01:23:08,088 --> 01:23:09,710
There are more missiles coming.

1033
01:23:14,539 --> 01:23:15,432
It's okay.

1034
01:23:17,988 --> 01:23:19,775
You just give me the sample.

1035
01:23:21,395 --> 01:23:22,870
I have called base.

1036
01:23:24,176 --> 01:23:26,338
I have taken care of the missiles.

1037
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:30,840
Listen, give me the sample.

1038
01:23:33,036 --> 01:23:34,716
Slowly.

1039
01:23:38,052 --> 01:23:39,295
Slowly.

1040
01:23:49,202 --> 01:23:50,709
All right, soldier.

1041
01:23:51,082 --> 01:23:52,787
Now, let's get you and that sample...

1042
01:23:53,485 --> 01:23:56,248
...back to AMS and see
if we can't get you some help.

1043
01:23:57,048 --> 01:23:58,309
Sorry, Charlie.

1044
01:24:00,074 --> 01:24:02,768
I know you went to hell and back
to get this...

1045
01:24:03,873 --> 01:24:05,945
...but I can't let you get in my way.

1046
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:12,148
There is millions of dollars
at stake for me.

1047
01:24:12,148 --> 01:24:13,819
Millions of dollars?

1048
01:24:14,172 --> 01:24:18,897
Bart, there are millions,
maybe billions of lives at stake here.

1049
01:24:19,626 --> 01:24:21,746
You and I
are going to take that sample...

1050
01:24:21,746 --> 01:24:24,673
...and we're going to head back to AMS
and we're going to do it now.

1051
01:24:24,673 --> 01:24:25,223
I don't think so.

1052
01:24:28,133 --> 01:24:29,627
Fuck.

1053
01:24:31,048 --> 01:24:33,693
Didn't want you hogging
all the glory for yourself.

1054
01:24:37,722 --> 01:24:38,584
Hey.

1055
01:24:39,414 --> 01:24:41,423
We got to get out of here. Now.

1056
01:24:41,423 --> 01:24:43,800
Grenade.

1057
01:25:01,286 --> 01:25:02,344
Is it all right?

1058
01:25:03,496 --> 01:25:07,424
Ellis, the blood sample.
Is it intact?

1059
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,766
Can we go back?

1060
01:25:17,094 --> 01:25:17,998
It's over.

1061
01:25:21,519 --> 01:25:22,487
It's over.

1062
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:25,417
Let's get out of here.

1063
01:25:30,841 --> 01:25:31,777
Another victim.

1064
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,679
It looks like they're spreading.

1065
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:38,457
They didn't get a piece of you,
did they?

1066
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:41,499
Before the missile strike?

1067
01:25:42,447 --> 01:25:43,980
I don't know.

1068
01:25:56,967 --> 01:26:00,261
You know what to do if it turns
out the answer is yes, right?

1069
01:26:02,212 --> 01:26:03,847
We don't know, do we?

1070
01:26:06,382 --> 01:26:07,494
No.

1071
01:26:10,714 --> 01:26:11,731
So we wait.

1072
01:26:11,731 --> 01:26:13,252
And see.

1073
01:26:17,237 --> 01:26:18,982
You should just shoot me now.

1074
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,817
You shouldn't take the chance.

1075
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:24,081
Get in.

1076
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:30,152
If I don't get a chance to...

1077
01:26:32,851 --> 01:26:34,110
To say...

1078
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,757
Yeah.

1079
01:26:38,221 --> 01:26:39,625
I know.

1080
01:26:47,109 --> 01:26:49,589
So you think the blast contained it?

1081
01:26:49,589 --> 01:26:51,736
Stopped the infection?

1082
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,691
"No."

1083
01:26:55,928 --> 01:26:58,321
So it's just going to go on and on.

1084
01:26:59,732 --> 01:27:01,093
Maybe.

1085
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:04,145
We will just have to wait and see.

1086
01:27:07,274 --> 01:27:08,224
Yeah.

1087
01:27:10,963 --> 01:27:12,443
Let's just do that.

1088
01:27:25,967 --> 01:27:27,758
The city has been overrun.

1089
01:27:27,758 --> 01:27:30,488
Attempts to stop the undead
have been ineffective.

1090
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:33,100
The vice president has ordered
a quarantine of the city...

1091
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,471
...from his undisclosed location
as attempts continue...

1092
01:27:35,471 --> 01:27:37,389
...to stem the spread of the disease.

1093
01:27:37,389 --> 01:27:40,365
We hope to have more details
as they develop.
