1
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,456
Check, charge or cash?

2
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:39,720
Cash.

3
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,356
Make it out to...

4
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,400
...Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

5
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:46,896
$788.30.

6
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,744
Taking me to breakfast?

7
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,611
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

8
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,448
Hey, Vincent.

9
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:46,153
Where are my barrettes?

10
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,380
I saw them on the kitchen table.

11
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:49,889
I already checked.

12
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,449
Coffee?

13
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,820
No school today?

14
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:56,093
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

15
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,791
Try under the sofa cushions.

16
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:03,731
He's already a half an hour late.

17
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,504
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

18
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:09,205
I'll make coffee.

19
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,439
Out of time.

20
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,920
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

21
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:28,726
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,829
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,735
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere!

24
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:36,237
What do you want me to do?

25
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:37,466
Find them!

26
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,542
- Mom, pay attention!
- All right, sweetie, all right!

27
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:42,474
Daddy's going to be here.

28
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:43,739
I won't be ready!

29
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:45,440
- I'll be late.
- No, you won't.

30
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,039
I will be late!

31
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:50,382
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

32
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:53,081
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

33
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:57,292
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

34
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,262
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

35
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,336
Give me another refill.

36
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:27,378
What's your name?

37
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:28,685
Waingro.

38
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,831
You're Michael?

39
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,078
You guys always work together?

40
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:56,218
All the time.

41
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:57,952
Real tight crew?

42
00:07:58,088 --> 00:07:59,214
Real tight.

43
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,782
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,560
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:18,504
How's he doing?

46
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:20,006
Hundred percent.

47
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,367
Right on schedule.

48
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,880
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

49
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,581
We're a mile and a half from you.

50
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:29,743
Okay.

51
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:55,435
Just crossed over the number one lane,
300 yards from you.

52
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,078
Get set.

53
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,405
I am.

54
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,183
Here we go.

55
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,610
211!

56
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,577
We're being held up!

57
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:21,421
- 211 alarm. Armored car.
- There's the call.

58
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:22,923
Three minutes.

59
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,433
Clear!

60
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,429
Eighty seconds left!

61
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,565
Get back! Get back!

62
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:36,963
Get back!

63
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:43,204
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

64
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:44,313
Cool it!

65
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:57,853
I got it.

66
00:11:58,328 --> 00:11:59,317
Got it.

67
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,567
You had to fuck with me.

68
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,663
Want to fuck with me?

69
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:33,826
What are you doing? What did he do?

70
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,386
He was making a move.

71
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:46,306
Dumb motherfucker.

72
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:43,189
A million six...

73
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,795
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

74
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,903
Here's $150,000 front money.

75
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:51,899
Get you the rest in two, three days.

76
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:54,634
Who owned these?

77
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,572
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

78
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,750
Roger Van Zant.

79
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:04,650
Owns banks in the Caymans...

80
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:08,657
...runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

81
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:09,980
So?

82
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,093
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

83
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:13,355
He's insured.

84
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:17,389
That's the point. He collects
100 percent from the insurance.

85
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:20,163
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us...

86
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:24,332
...for 60 percent of their value. Makes
40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

87
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,405
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

88
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,304
Try it on.

89
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:33,439
Kelso called.

90
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:34,608
About what?

91
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:37,684
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

92
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,180
I don't need his score. I got my own.

93
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,654
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

94
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,456
9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

95
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:45,858
What happened?

96
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:48,525
Don't ask.

97
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,958
Find the ambulance?

98
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:28,265
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street.

99
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:32,198
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

100
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:38,908
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

101
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,251
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

102
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,579
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

103
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,120
You taking this one?

104
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,825
Or does it stay in Division?

105
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:55,486
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

106
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:57,498
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

107
00:15:58,234 --> 00:15:59,633
We got three motorists.

108
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:02,193
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

109
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,831
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

110
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:07,875
Did he ID anybody?

111
00:16:07,944 --> 00:16:10,435
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

112
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:14,374
What about them?

113
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:18,382
According to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

114
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:19,582
Smart.

115
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,849
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

116
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:24,521
Now, I figure this guy...

117
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,921
...went for that hold-out piece,
ankle holster.

118
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:29,857
From here...

119
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,427
...bang, bang...

120
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,991
...bang, bang, bang.

121
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,461
This side.

122
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:38,800
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

123
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,809
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bones, close range.

124
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,278
Probably executed.

125
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,843
It was a million six in bearer bonds.

126
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:50,748
They ignored the loose cash.

127
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,653
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

128
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:56,587
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

129
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,321
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

130
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:02,323
...escaped in under three minutes.

131
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:05,262
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

132
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,663
Two freeways...

133
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,326
...within a quarter of a mile.

134
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:09,666
Traffic video camera?

135
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,131
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

136
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,766
You recognize the M.O.?

137
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:15,037
M. O...

138
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:16,936
...is that they're good.

139
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:21,279
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

140
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,715
...they didn't hesitate.

141
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:26,744
Popped guard number three because...
what difference does it make?

142
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,850
Why leave a living witness?

143
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,026
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

144
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,658
The shape charge.

145
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:40,729
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

146
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,862
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

147
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:46,606
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that mystify us.

148
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:50,240
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You're gonna get the phone book.

149
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:53,214
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

150
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:58,179
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

151
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,654
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

152
00:18:00,823 --> 00:18:02,256
Hang in with Forensics.

153
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:05,087
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

154
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:08,094
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

155
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:12,394
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

156
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,000
Anyone want some pie?

157
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:33,246
Gotta go to the john.

158
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,888
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

159
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,633
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

160
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:28,001
...to make up for his full end...

161
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:32,807
...'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

162
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:12,585
Hold it!

163
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:54,050
Where's the rest?

164
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,921
We're late. You look too good to go out.

165
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:59,193
I'll just jump you right here.

166
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,360
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

167
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,901
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

168
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:09,903
Come on.

169
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:11,667
You gotta be kidding me.

170
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:14,441
Honey...

171
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:19,344
...it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

172
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:20,480
Let's go.

173
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,081
Get your coat.

174
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:27,181
There is no point talking.
You're a child growing older.

175
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:28,688
What does that mean?

176
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:33,018
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

177
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,290
...because I married a gambling junkie.

178
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:37,662
Get in the fucking car.

179
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,096
What am I doing in here?

180
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:42,666
You're not!

181
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:45,229
You want me to leave the bank book
and the car keys...

182
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:47,172
...in the kitchen on the way out the door?

183
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:50,440
- Are we going?
- Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

184
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:54,978
Don't even think about...

185
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:22,076
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

186
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,208
Albert Torena call Vincent?

187
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:27,537
No.

188
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,149
Report came in.

189
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,447
The explosive was Dy-Ex,
used in demolition.

190
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:34,646
You can pick it up in Nevada...

191
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,382
...Arizona, New Mexico.

192
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,456
Too common to trace a sale.

193
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,421
That's wonderful.

194
00:24:00,616 --> 00:24:01,640
You all right?

195
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,412
What happened? Where have you been?

196
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:06,079
Work.

197
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:09,120
Lauren's dad show up?

198
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,918
Didn't call...

199
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,827
...didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

200
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:20,100
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

201
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:23,832
I don't know.

202
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,307
Fucking jerk.

203
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,272
Is she okay?

204
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:32,439
She's been in her room all day.

205
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:35,242
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

206
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,341
I made dinner...

207
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,711
...for us, four hours ago.

208
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:44,483
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

209
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,925
...you withdraw.

210
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:50,260
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

211
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:53,032
...off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

212
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:54,634
I'm sorry...

213
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,800
...if the goddamn...

214
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:58,804
...chicken...

215
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,202
...got overcooked.

216
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,060
Coffee, sir?

217
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:00,223
Please.

218
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:07,603
Will you pass the cream?

219
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:11,334
Thanks.

220
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:12,641
What'd you get?

221
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:14,747
What?

222
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,341
What are you reading?

223
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,525
Book about metals.

224
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,231
Stress Fractures in Titanium.

225
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:34,263
What kind of work do you do?

226
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:40,671
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

227
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:46,844
I've seen you in the store.

228
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:48,211
What store?

229
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,642
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

230
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:55,079
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

231
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:56,953
I'm sorry I bothered you.

232
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:10,465
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

233
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:13,638
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

234
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,308
My name's Neil.

235
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:21,810
I'm Eady.

236
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:26,245
You like working there?

237
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,082
Sure.

238
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:33,489
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

239
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:34,754
What area?

240
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:36,754
Graphic design.

241
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,726
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

242
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:44,337
...the store's a day job
until I get enough going.

243
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,098
Who do you do that for?

244
00:27:49,178 --> 00:27:50,645
A restaurant.

245
00:27:51,113 --> 00:27:53,104
I did their menus, and...

246
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,944
...a small record label.

247
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,179
CDs.

248
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:02,486
I've done two so far.

249
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,522
You go to school for that?

250
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,018
Yeah.

251
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:10,530
I went to Parsons.

252
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:11,860
Where's that?

253
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,328
New York City.

254
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:15,729
How long you been here?

255
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:18,204
About a year.

256
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:20,141
Like it?

257
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,977
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

258
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:34,383
Live in this neighborhood?

259
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:37,254
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

260
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:41,652
It's a little house I rent.

261
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,359
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

262
00:28:46,902 --> 00:28:48,164
What about you?

263
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:49,499
I live up here.

264
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:51,304
That's very funny.

265
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,742
Where's your family from originally?

266
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,012
They're Scots-lrish.

267
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,910
They emigrated to Appalachia...

268
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:07,080
...in the late 1700s.

269
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:11,358
Where are you from?

270
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,425
The Bay area.

271
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:16,262
Your folks there?

272
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,792
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

273
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,462
...I don't know where he is.

274
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:25,199
Got a brother somewhere.

275
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:33,071
You have a tight family. I can tell.

276
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,441
Right?

277
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:36,948
You're right.

278
00:29:46,728 --> 00:29:48,389
City of lights...

279
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,392
In Fiji, they have these...

280
00:29:53,468 --> 00:29:57,165
...iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

281
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:00,602
That's what it looks like out there.

282
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,141
You been there?

283
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,413
No, I'm going there some day.

284
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,855
You travel a lot?

285
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:20,625
Yeah.

286
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,993
Travelling makes you lonely?

287
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,070
I'm alone. I am not...

288
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:31,836
...lonely.

289
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:33,232
You?

290
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:36,242
Real lonely.

291
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,463
Albert!

292
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:46,299
Shit!

293
00:32:47,142 --> 00:32:49,804
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

294
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,043
You were supposed to get back to me.

295
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:55,046
Where the fuck you been?

296
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:57,643
I couldn't break free.

297
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,778
Let's violate his ass right now.

298
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:01,479
I do for you...

299
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:04,123
...you don't do for me, is that it?

300
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:09,230
Listen, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hidden like a Flamingo matador.

301
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:11,729
That's got nothing to do with me.

302
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:16,563
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

303
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:18,069
You bullshit.

304
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,731
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

305
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:23,403
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

306
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:26,413
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

307
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:30,144
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

308
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,549
You fall in love?

309
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:34,214
Did you fall in love...

310
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:36,885
...and went off somewhere?

311
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,222
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

312
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:42,919
Give me all you got!

313
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,827
Give me all you got!

314
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,765
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

315
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,596
I heard Richard?

316
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:53,035
He's going to talk to you.

317
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:56,437
He's gonna meet you tonight.

318
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:58,035
He's not here, is he?

319
00:33:58,113 --> 00:33:59,603
No, he'll meet you tonight.

320
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:01,205
What happened to now?

321
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:05,145
I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

322
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:06,342
Bullshit.

323
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:08,421
I swear. He said no...

324
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:10,925
...'cause he in Phoenix.

325
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:13,424
"By the time I get to Phoenix

326
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,724
"He'll be rising

327
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:19,196
"He'll probably leave a note

328
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:21,126
"Right on the door"

329
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:23,363
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

330
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,032
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

331
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:30,970
At 2:00 a.m.

332
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,143
Be there.

333
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:33,805
You be there too.

334
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,816
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

335
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:39,752
I got things to do, I got places to be.

336
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:42,148
Be there.

337
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:50,893
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

338
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:55,829
What is it?

339
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:58,834
It's a bank.

340
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:02,777
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

341
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:04,937
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

342
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:08,244
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

343
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,874
On the prowl or strong?

344
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,009
Through the door.

345
00:35:11,086 --> 00:35:12,417
How many guys?

346
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:16,182
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

347
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:19,749
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

348
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:22,191
Sounds like a cowboy score.

349
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:25,959
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

350
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:29,100
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

351
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:31,202
Two Telco and a cellular.

352
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,938
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

353
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:37,869
...the night before...

354
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:39,444
...you cut in...

355
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:42,208
...and trick out
the alarm system computer...

356
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:43,715
...to turn itself...

357
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:45,878
...and the video recorders off...

358
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:48,212
...20 minutes before you enter.

359
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:50,782
Architectural, electrical plans?

360
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:51,983
I got that.

361
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,029
I got the boards already built.
They go into the CPU.

362
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:57,888
What's the estimate?

363
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:02,963
12.1, 12.2 million.

364
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:07,566
You're on.

365
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,972
Congratulations.

366
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:13,945
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

367
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:16,814
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

368
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:19,985
My way, you get 100 percent
from the insurance company...

369
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,023
...take the bonds back from us...

370
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,651
...at 60 cents on the dollar
and make yourself another 40 percent.

371
00:36:27,662 --> 00:36:30,290
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

372
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:32,932
Sure, you got a deal.

373
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:37,069
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

374
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:40,402
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

375
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:41,868
Yeah, okay.

376
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:44,144
Nice talking to you.

377
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:46,876
You gonna deal with these guys?

378
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:49,849
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

379
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:52,586
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

380
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:56,282
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

381
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:03,726
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

382
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:06,961
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

383
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:08,900
How'd you get this information?

384
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,335
Just comes to you.

385
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:12,702
This stuff just flies through the air.

386
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:16,437
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

387
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:18,136
I know how to grab it.

388
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:25,679
Okay, here we go.

389
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:27,688
13.9 million.

390
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:32,793
- I bought it.
- Good.

391
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:34,718
What did I tell you?

392
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,489
Here.

393
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:43,636
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

394
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:45,999
How is he?

395
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:47,897
He's a businessman.

396
00:38:26,114 --> 00:38:27,604
Chris is at my place.

397
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:31,946
What's wrong?

398
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,120
Husband and wife stuff.

399
00:38:34,722 --> 00:38:36,417
I'll let him sleep it off.

400
00:38:50,805 --> 00:38:52,295
What happened to you?

401
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:58,570
When will you get some furniture?

402
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:00,341
When I get around to it.

403
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:04,918
Charlene's gonna leave me.

404
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:08,152
Why?

405
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:13,585
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

406
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:16,689
With everything we've been doing?

407
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:20,427
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

408
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:23,327
When you gonna get an old lady?

409
00:39:23,438 --> 00:39:25,099
When I get around to it.

410
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:29,602
You got something else on the side?

411
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:32,510
Nothing regular.

412
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:35,609
She got something else on the side?

413
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,039
You sure?

414
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,676
Yeah, I'm sure.

415
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:43,847
I don't know what you're doing.

416
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,989
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

417
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,022
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

418
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:57,763
"...that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

419
00:39:58,139 --> 00:39:59,367
Remember that?

420
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:09,145
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

421
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,597
We take delivery of cash from Van Zant...

422
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:28,659
...then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

423
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:30,268
Bank? What bank?

424
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:33,536
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

425
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:35,508
That goes too. Then the bank.

426
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,070
Want some breakfast?

427
00:40:48,523 --> 00:40:49,922
Are you okay?

428
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:51,757
Yeah, sugar.

429
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,428
For real.

430
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,661
I'll do good.

431
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:03,336
I'll see you later.

432
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,619
You Solenko?

433
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:22,215
Don Breedan.

434
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,488
Grierson, my parole officer, told me to
come by here, see if you had a job for me.

435
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,825
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

436
00:41:28,896 --> 00:41:30,625
I'm a great grill man.

437
00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:32,163
Good. Good for you.

438
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:36,329
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

439
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:39,862
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

440
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:41,841
I'll violate you back fast.

441
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,807
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

442
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:49,111
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

443
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,321
What are you waiting for?

444
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:18,808
Malibu Equity and Investments.

445
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,404
Roger Van Zant.

446
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:21,641
Please hold.

447
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,286
This is Roger Van Zant.

448
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:29,414
I'm supposed to get something.

449
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:32,652
Someone will call you back
from another line.

450
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:36,460
818-133-6089.

451
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:06,590
I got a package for you. There's a drive-in
on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.

452
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:08,785
Just send one man, alone.

453
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:36,556
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

454
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:39,520
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

455
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,861
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

456
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,156
He's nobody, Neil.

457
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,723
He's a legit liquor salesman
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

458
00:43:47,135 --> 00:43:48,500
Chris will make up.

459
00:43:48,736 --> 00:43:51,398
- It's too late! I'm sick of him!
- Shut up!

460
00:43:53,107 --> 00:43:56,270
Here's the deal. You'll give Chris
one last shot.

461
00:43:56,344 --> 00:44:00,337
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

462
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:02,909
...on my own, anywhere you want.

463
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,779
Dominick will go with you.

464
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:07,284
And my word counts. But right now...

465
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,954
...you will give him the chance.

466
00:44:14,128 --> 00:44:15,789
Clean up, go home.

467
00:44:17,098 --> 00:44:18,759
Clean up, go home!

468
00:45:04,845 --> 00:45:06,005
Give me your money.

469
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:08,306
You'll get smoked with that shit.

470
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:09,576
Won't be you.

471
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,812
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

472
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:47,247
Vincent, hey, man.

473
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,756
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

474
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,384
It's all right.

475
00:45:55,596 --> 00:45:57,496
What have you got for me?

476
00:45:57,965 --> 00:46:02,459
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

477
00:46:04,272 --> 00:46:06,467
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

478
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:09,872
...that somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

479
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:13,107
...they might find two Turbos
and a 911 slope.

480
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,745
You looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

481
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:19,614
I'm a good citizen.

482
00:46:19,687 --> 00:46:21,279
I'm Donald Duck.

483
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:23,454
You got something to tell me?

484
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:26,855
Check this out, cuz.

485
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:31,095
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

486
00:46:31,399 --> 00:46:34,800
...that you gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

487
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:37,232
Hanna is straight up.

488
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:40,371
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

489
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,773
And you know because I say so...

490
00:46:43,344 --> 00:46:46,177
...after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

491
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:47,236
Fuck you.

492
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:48,778
You understand?

493
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:51,007
I'd get killed for telling you.

494
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:53,349
You'd get killed walking your doggie!

495
00:46:53,421 --> 00:46:54,786
All right, man...

496
00:46:55,323 --> 00:46:57,723
...there was a cat I was locked up with.

497
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:01,726
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

498
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,293
And so?

499
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:08,828
He's a big fiend for action.

500
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,099
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

501
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:16,633
...he goes on and on, running down to me
how he ain't done nothing...

502
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:19,509
...and nothing's been going on
and all this bullshit.

503
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,571
Right then and there I know...

504
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:24,778
...this cat's got something going down.

505
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,089
Pretty fucking great.

506
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,060
Albert, what's wrong with you?

507
00:47:38,766 --> 00:47:41,599
You drag me here, waste my time like this.

508
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,066
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

509
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:46,565
That's right.

510
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,107
Well, I am...

511
00:47:48,342 --> 00:47:50,037
...over-fucking-whelmed.

512
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:52,777
What do you want for that,
a G-man badge?

513
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:55,714
You gonna make the call on them Porches?

514
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:57,949
Is he kidding me?

515
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,412
I'm telling you:

516
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:01,819
Slick is no joke.

517
00:48:02,523 --> 00:48:04,047
He's double time.

518
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,387
Say what?

519
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:08,061
"Slick." What does that mean?

520
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:10,629
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

521
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:13,894
Tell me about him.

522
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:17,968
About 6 feet tall...

523
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:20,230
...lots of jailhouse tats.

524
00:48:20,307 --> 00:48:22,468
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

525
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:26,469
What's his name?

526
00:48:27,515 --> 00:48:28,777
Cheritto.

527
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,044
Michael Cheritto.

528
00:48:35,356 --> 00:48:37,586
Thirty-three busts since 1976.

529
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:40,652
Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.

530
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:43,457
Two out of a three-to-five year beef
in Attica.

531
00:48:43,531 --> 00:48:45,123
Three years in Marion.

532
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:48,167
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

533
00:48:48,235 --> 00:48:49,532
Jacket's two inches thick.

534
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:51,571
Who do I have there now?

535
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,364
- Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
- Tell SIS...

536
00:48:54,675 --> 00:48:58,406
...I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

537
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:00,470
We never close. Open every day.

538
00:49:00,915 --> 00:49:02,746
Bug the car, the house, the work.

539
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:04,717
When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...

540
00:49:04,785 --> 00:49:07,583
...I want pictures of who he moves
and sits with.

541
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:11,255
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

542
00:49:11,525 --> 00:49:14,016
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

543
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:11,712
Put your hands where I can see them.

544
00:50:11,919 --> 00:50:14,114
Put your hands where I can see them.

545
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:16,252
I tell you what to do.

546
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,219
I tell you how to do it.

547
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:22,484
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

548
00:50:24,098 --> 00:50:26,566
...take the package and throw it in here.

549
00:50:44,652 --> 00:50:45,584
Behind you.

550
00:50:45,653 --> 00:50:46,642
On the right.
