(metal clanging)

73
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,301

already done that joke,

74
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,919
so I'll just move right
along to serious business.

75
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,079
Getting home in case of emergency is

76
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,010
as easy as one, two, three.

77
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,878
Here's how.

78
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:02,810
One, you leave your family's contact

79
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,915
at the local Red Cross in (indistinct).

80
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:06,536
Two, the Red Cross contacts you

81
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,952
and supplies your commanding officer-

82
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:10,526
- Fan mail from Crystal?

83
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:11,359
- Yeah.

84
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,200
- [Radio Announcer] And three,
the company cuts your orders,

85
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,629
and you're on your way, so let's hope-

86
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:15,462
- Come on, hurry up.

87
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:16,295
- (laughing) Okay.

88
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,128

(knife slashing)

90
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,284
- Well, aren't you gonna read it?

91
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,850
- [Radio Announcer] This
is just to remind you

92
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,864
that we're celebrating-

93
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,255

Nice.

100
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:43,800

from Colorado (laughs).

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,967
It's just like

102
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:51,373
this world of these doesn't
exist anymore (laughs).

103
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:55,317
- Wear those out in the bush,

00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:58,576
Charlie will be able to see
you from Cambodia (laughs).

105
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:01,763

186
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:24,231
- Yeah.

187
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:26,501
(paper rustling)

188
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:28,689
That and the rest of it.

189
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,522
(drawer slamming)

190
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:35,892
(footsteps plodding)

191
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,817
(chair creaking)

192
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:41,900
(footsteps plodding)

193
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:47,837
We're right up against the
DMZ with North Vietnam, here.

194
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,754
- Crawford.

195
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,241
I can read a fucking map.

196
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:57,186
(footsteps plodding)

197
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:58,859
(dramatic music continues)

198
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,638
That's the perfect location for the North

199
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:03,489
to start a wholesale
invasion on the South.

200
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:06,980
- A North Vietnamese army
offensive is imminent here

201
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,291
in Quang Tri Province.

202
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,412
(Heinrick laughs)

203
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:11,361
- I've been saying that for months.

204
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,550
Nothing's happened.

205
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,259
- Intelligence from our
special forces in Laos says

206
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,052
that brigade-sized units have infiltrated

207
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:23,172
through Laos on the Ho
Chi Minh Trail last week.

208
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,060
(dramatic music continues)

209
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,492
- Wasn't supposed to be
any special forces in Laos.

210
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:32,001
It's a good thing
somebody's still fighting

211
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:35,668
for what's right, not
just for what's legal.

212
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:41,164
- That's why we've been
bombing all along the trail.

213
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:48,999
- [Heinrick] You ever heard
of crabgrass, Crawford?

214
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:49,832
- No.

215
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:53,588
(dramatic music continues)

216
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:55,588
- Well, it's tenacious.

217
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,315
You gotta dig it and pull it,

218
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:04,626
but you never really get it all.

219
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:09,043
You have to extract every
tiny, invisible little root

220
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:13,178
'cause, otherwise, the just grows back.

221
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:18,180
- Yes, I suppose so.

222
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:22,855
(feet shuffling)

223
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:26,851
(paper rustling)
(dramatic music continues)

224
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:31,351
The NVA's local contact is
a Viet Cong province chief.

225
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:36,399
He's holed up somewhere
in a free-fire zone.

226
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,052
(file thudding)

227
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,052
We have intel that his
people have been trained

228
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:43,802
to guide the NVA into
our bases and into Hue.

229
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,071
(match scraping)

230
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,404
We find him and identify
his cadre, we get a twofer.

231
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,692
We disrupt that NVA offensive,

232
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:58,041
dismantle the VC network in Quang Tri.

233
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,711
(dramatic music continues)

234
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,128
Heinrick, you bring him back.

235
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,724
(paper rustling)

236
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:11,924
- You know that's a large
area to find someone.

237
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:14,364
- [Crawford] Someone
higher up doesn't like you.

238
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:15,447
- Yeah, well.

239
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,501
- (sighs) It's all free
fire around those hamlets,

240
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:24,259
farmers, all loyal to the North.

241
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,341
(dramatic music continues)

242
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:29,174
(bystander speaking indistinctly)

243
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:32,152
- Guess no democracy or the
American way for them, huh?

244
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,910
- Our ARVN allies have worked
over two of his helpers,

245
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,327
but we can't get 'em to talk.

246
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:42,879
- Oh, they'll talk.

247
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,129
You just gotta ask the right questions.

248
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:50,018
(cigarette hissing)

249
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,874
(leash clinking)

250
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:53,707
Come on.

255
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:19,877

256
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:20,710

Hairy Hole Holis pull that,

"We have to get to our waypoint," shit?

268
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:53,819
Since when does he care about a waypoint?

269
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:58,013
- What's a waypoint?
(boot thudding)

270
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:03,013
- 'Cause Cap'n said he need
to have combat experience

271
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:05,080
to get his own company.

(blanket rustling)

273
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:12,361
- In other words, he has
to get his card punched

274
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:15,333
before he can get a
company and make captain?

275

That piece of shit.

276
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:18,766

I might need a little bit of information,

Now, buddy.

00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:29,330
to hear something-

367
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,344
(match hissing)
(dramatic music)

368
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,492
(matchbox thudding)

369
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:36,333
- I got just the squad for you.

370
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,183
(bell ringing)

371
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,100
They're great trackers.

372
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:45,893
- Is that right, Crawford?

373
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,643
(birds chirping)

374
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:57,493
(helicopters whirring)

375
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:00,243
(rock splashing)

376
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:03,501
(rock splashing)

377
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:07,061
(water sloshing)

378
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,391
(birds chirping)

379
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,141
(water sloshing)

380
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:18,373
(birds chirping)

381
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:21,591
(airplane humming)

382
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:24,341
(birds chirping)

383
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:33,722
(helicopter whirring)

384
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:36,472
(birds chirping)

385
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:40,950
(helicopter whirring)

386
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,369
(birds chirping)

387
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:50,536
(helicopter whirring)

388
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:01,342
- Johnny.

389
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,077
(grass rustling)

390
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:11,884
John.

391
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,482
First sergeant wants you.

392
00:20:20,814 --> 00:20:23,564
(birds chirping)

393
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:31,723
(feet shuffling)

394
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,379
(clothes rustling)

395
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:38,218
(feet shuffling)

396
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:39,238
(clothes rustling)

397
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,806
(birds chirping)

398
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:44,271
- [Camp Radio Announcer] The
first flag, two, two, inbound,

399
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:45,771
ETA standby, over.

400
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:49,606
- Sergeant Reese, you seem to think

401
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,401
I have an endless supply of lieutenants.

402
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:54,560
(canister thudding)

403
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,969
I do not.

404
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:56,802
- [John] I understand.

405
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:59,059
- They keep getting
killed or transferred out

406
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,440
after a few months in the bush,

407
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,161
and now, Lieutenant
Holis wants to kill you

408
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:09,569
because you discharged your
weapon next to his ear.

409
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:13,045
- First Sergeant, you-
- Don't care.

410
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:16,464
Captain would have to court
marshal him for killing you,

411
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:18,816
and I lose another junior officer.

412
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:20,726
- [John] But he was-
- Don't care.

413
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:23,259
- [Camp Radio Announcer]
Battery four, major close.

414
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:26,137
- I also have a shortage of good NCOs,

415
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:30,147
so I can't court martial you
because then I'd have privates

416
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:32,437
leading platoons in the field.

417
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:34,149
(saliva sputtering)

418
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:37,037
Do you understand my problem?

419
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:39,392
- First Sergeant, I sensed NVA,

420
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:41,832
platoon sized, in front of us.

421
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,361
- [Schott] Sensed?

422
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:45,799
- And Johnny, Sergeant Reese heard

423
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,201
a Chicom machine gun bolt click.

424
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:50,793
We needed to pull back and call in arty,

425
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:51,626
but Hairy Hole-

426
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,293
- Sensed and needed.

427
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:58,932
This is not a California hippie commune.

428
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:01,862
This is an infantry company.

429
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,892
And Alexander, I didn't ask you anything.

430
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:06,952
Alexander, why are you even here?

431
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,535
I called for Reese.

432
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,541
Fucking Batman and Robin.

433
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,389
I should cancel your R&R,

434
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:20,227
and Reese, you should be
rotting in the Long Binh Jail.

435
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,798
(canister clanking)

436
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,631
(chair creaking)

437
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,710
(radio announcer speaking indistinctly)

438
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,508
But God help me for having
to be the one who says it.

439
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:30,561
You saved Lieutenant Holis's ass.

440
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,841
(radio announcer speaking indistinctly)

441
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:35,228
Battalion just called.

442
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,561
Hairy Ho, Lieutenant Holis
is gonna get his company.

443
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:45,930
(radio announcer speaking indistinctly)

444
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,019
Sergeant Reese, get outta here.

445
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:48,979
(footsteps plodding)

446
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:50,312
Alexander, stay.

447
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,106
- First Sergeant.
- Don't, no.

448
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,523
Don't say a word.

449
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:03,026
(birds chirping)

450
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:06,575
I thought I'd seen this army
do every fool thing possible.

451
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:11,575
(radio announcer speaking indistinctly)

452
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:14,252
Sergeant Alexander, your request

453
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:20,204
for officer candidate school
has been tentatively approved.

454
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:22,287
Just need battalion okay.

455
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:27,626
By God, they're gonna make you an officer.

456
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:29,126
You are dismissed.

457
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:33,139
And Alexander, don't fuck this up.

458
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,982
(soldiers laughing)

459
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:43,259
- [Ian] Man, his place
always smells like shit.

460
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,351
- [John] Yeah, it's the smell of victory.

461
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:45,184
(bottle clinking)

462
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:46,330

465
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,414
- [Soldier] Is Mamasan a real mother?

466
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:52,952
- [Soldier] Yeah, she's a
real motherfucking bitch.

467

468
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:57,205
- [Thumper] Appreciate it.

469
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:58,038
- [Soldier] I mean, I'll go back to-

470
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:00,053
- [Thumper] All right, y'all, boys.

471
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:01,042

472
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:01,875

You tell me.
- [Soldier] Stays true.

Even though I don't agree with it,

538
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,651
- By the way, I talked
to, to Rose over there.

539
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:42,411
She was saying she going
to take care of us.

540
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:43,262
- Really?
- Oh, really?

541
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:44,131
Okay.
- I told her

542
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:44,964
to give us about two-

543
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:47,072
- That says something,
that says something.

00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:49,822
(relaxing music)

545
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:54,563

time I spoke to a woman.

546
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:55,813
- Yeah, right? (laughs)

547
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:59,345
(soldiers laughing)

548
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:00,178
- [Soldier] Oh, excuse me.

549
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:01,483
- [Soldier] Yeah, and you,
and you started squirming

550
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:02,430
once you saw the cat,

551
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,705
and you just kaboom, kaboom,
and just ran out (laughs).

552
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:07,297
- Ow, bitch bit my ear.

553
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:08,405
(chair creaking)

554
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:09,485
- Leave her.

555
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,103
- Whatever, she just bit me.

556
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,085
- Yeah, no shit, what do
you (laughing) expect?

557
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,056
Why don't you find one
of 'em with no teeth?

558
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,667
You know, be easier.

559
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,544
(soldiers laughing)

560
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,717
- [Soldier] Fucking Gomer (laughs).

561
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:21,725
- Don't worry about that shit, come on.

562
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,558
Fuck them.

563
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:24,310
Don't worry about those fucking fags.

564
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,808
Don't worry about them.

565
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:28,509
(soldier groans)

566
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:31,842
Well, ground pounders, long time no see.

567
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:33,997
- Well, if it isn't

568
00:26:33,997 --> 00:26:37,947
the rear-echelon motherfuckers
finally arriving.

569
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:39,904
Welcome to the war, boys.

570
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:42,137
I didn't think you were actually
into fighting the enemy.

571
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:44,168
(relaxing music continues)

572
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:45,979
- Got in late last night.

573
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,267
NVA closed the roads.

574
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:48,100
- Oh, yeah?

575
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,379
The fuck you do about it?

576
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,427
Throw tire irons at 'em?

577
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:52,728
(soldiers laughing)

578
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:55,368
- Hey, no fighting in here.

579
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:58,419
(bottle thudding)

580
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,252
(bottle thudding)

581
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:01,329
(bartender speaking in foreign language)

582
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,792
(coin clinking)

583
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,730
(glass clinking)
(whiskey sloshing)

584
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,851
- [Soldier] I want some free whiskey.

585
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:10,341
- [Soldier] Free whiskey's for pussies.

586
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:12,971
- Huh, at least we ain't fighting this war

587
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:14,861
by waving our dicks at each other.

588
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:17,568
(glass thudding)
(soldier laughing)

589
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:18,440
(glass thudding)

590
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,320
When did infantry go butt pirate?

591
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,009
Thought that was a Navy thing.

592
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,759
(chair clanging)

593
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:29,108
- Macklin, shut your mouth and drink up.

594
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:32,191
You and your friends are leaving now.

595
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,140
- Look at that.

596
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,389
Pet Pirate wants us to get outta here

597
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:41,120
so he can go all kissy
kissy with his boyfriend.

598
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,953
- Is that

599
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:42,786
fucking funny to you?
- Hey.

600
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,619
Fuck him, though.

601
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:44,536
- That's fucking funny to you, isn't it?

602
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:45,369
- Shit.

603
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:47,236
Macklin, you should know better

604
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,254
than the show up here and talk shit.

605
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:51,334
- Alexander, you queer fucker.

606
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:52,167
- And?

607
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,000
(radio announcer chattering indistinctly)

608
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,051
Say it again, you coward motherfucker.

609
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:54,884
(energetic music)

610
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:55,717

(soldier grunting)

615
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:05,668
- No way, motherfucker.

616
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:08,251
(body thudding)

617
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,524
(soldiers grunting)
- Motherfucker.

619
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:14,015

(John breathing heavily)

622
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:24,469
- John, you always stick
up for that faggot?

623
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:27,801
(Macklin yelling)

624
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:31,144
- Now, specialist fourth class Macklin,

625
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:34,123
do you have an apology
for Sergeant Alexander?

626
00:28:34,123 --> 00:28:35,704
(Macklin breathing heavily)

627
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:36,537
Do you?

628
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,314
- I'm sorry (whimpering).

629
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:44,981
(energetic music continues)

630
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:49,034
(Macklin breathing heavily)

631
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:51,951
(Thumper groaning)

632
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:56,684
(body thudding)

633
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:59,074
(door creaking)

634
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:01,543
- That was all fucking about you two?

635
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,363
- Go ahead, say it.

636
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:06,164
- I wanna know who the fuck
is next to me in a foxhole,

637
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:08,084
who's taking a fucking shower next to me,

638
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,514
who has my back in a fucking firefight,

639
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:12,463
and why the fuck I am fighting in a bar.

640
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:14,215
(door clanging)

641
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,974
- We should get back to company.

642
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:16,807
- I just don't wanna think

643
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:18,282
one of you are just
trying to suck my dick.

644
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,052
- Who would wanna suck your ugly cock?

645
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:20,885
- Don't fuck-
- Hey, hey.

646
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:21,849
- Think about it.
- Fuck you, man, fuck you.

647
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:23,481
- Hey.

648
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:24,460
(gravel crunching)

649
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,321
- I just put one of them
truck-driving fools down

650
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:29,238
'cause they disrespected all of us.

651
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,040
We're alive today 'cause you
always told us the truth.

652
00:29:36,018 --> 00:29:40,897
I'll never forget what you
did in them damn hills ever.

653
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:42,147
But this, this.

654
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,616
(footsteps plodding)

655
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:47,605
- [Burd] Go fuck yourselves.

656
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,386
- Hey, hey, Burd, man, look.

657
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:50,826
Doc, come on, let's go.

658
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:53,909
(footsteps plodding)

659
00:29:58,754 --> 00:29:59,587
- Yeah, you know what?

660
00:29:59,587 --> 00:30:01,084
I'm outta here.

661
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,516
(crickets chirping)

662
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:03,933
- Hey, I'm sorry.

663
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:07,684
I just wanted us to be together tonight.

664
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:10,274
- Hell, I woulda killed
him if it he'd'a hurt ya.

665
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:11,954
You know, if the army
finds out we're fuck-

666
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:13,863
- What are they gonna
do, send us to Vietnam?

667
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:16,474
- They don't let queers be officers, Ian.

668
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:19,604
Get that through your fucking head.

669
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:22,714
They don't let queers be officers.

670
00:30:22,714 --> 00:30:25,179
(crickets chirping)

671
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:27,929
(dramatic music)

672
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,495
(crickets chirping)

673
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:44,264
(John breathing heavily)

674
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:49,223
- [Ian] Hey.

675
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:56,606
(dramatic music continues)

676
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,603
Hey.

677
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:04,265
- I'm all right.

678
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,323
Don't go.

679
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:13,633
(dramatic music continues)

680
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:16,633
(crickets chirping)

681
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,648
(breath whooshing)

682
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:26,587
(dramatic music continues)

683
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:45,751
(dramatic music continues)

684
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,751
- It's okay.

685
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,831
(hands slapping)

686
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:08,430
(dramatic music continues)

687
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,430
(crickets chirping)

688
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:15,452
(birds chirping)

689
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,153
(dramatic music continues)

690
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:41,082
(birds chirping)

691
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:43,999
(stick clattering)

692
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:49,858
(dramatic music continues)

693
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:54,465
(John sobbing)

694
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:04,904
Can we speak with you?

695
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:08,361
(John sobbing)

696
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,528
- My French is better than my English.

697
00:33:16,143 --> 00:33:18,726
They try to control our country

698
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:22,447
for 100 year,

699
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:27,707
and then they left.

700
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:31,433
And now, you have come.

701
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:37,965
(monk speaking in foreign language)

702
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:41,632
(dramatic music continues)

703
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:46,369
You suffer

704
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:54,244
because you are attached to this fighting

705
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:00,349
and to the dead.

706
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,084
They are free.

707
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:09,675
You are not.

708
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:17,198
(dramatic music continues)

709
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:27,744
(chain clinking)

710
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:31,957
(dramatic music continues)

711
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:34,957
(crickets chirping)

712
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:49,992
(dramatic music continues)

713
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:52,742
(chain clinking)

714
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:56,495
The dead, they have no secrets.

715
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:02,260
On the third day,

716
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:15,337
peril.

717
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:20,014
(birds chirping)

718
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:25,574
(birds chirping)

719
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:28,085
(boot thudding)

720
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:30,918
(water splashing)

721
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,610
- [Ian] How you doing?

722
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,193
You wanna sit down?

723
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,225
- [John] All right.

724
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:50,326
(birds chirping)

725
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:05,774
- [Ian] We don't have
to go home, you know.

726
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:11,693
We could stay here after the war.

727
00:36:12,732 --> 00:36:16,271
(birds chirping)

728
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:17,591
- [John] You have to,

729
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:19,342
you have to see the
world the way it is, Ian.

730
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:22,120
It, it, there's no place
for people like us.

731
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,363
(dramatic music continues)

732
00:36:23,363 --> 00:36:25,863
- We're pushing it, two tours.

733
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:28,714
I've been stabbed.

734
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,279
You've been shot.

735
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:38,254
We could go someplace and just be alone.

736
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,604
(birds chirping)

737
00:36:41,604 --> 00:36:43,104
You could recover.

738
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,317
(John sighs)

739
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:51,900
(dramatic music continues)

740
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:02,165
First sergeant thinks battalion'll approve

741
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:04,005
my orders for OCS.

742
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:06,584
(birds chirping)

743
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:10,167
(dramatic music continues)

744
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:14,943
(Ian exhales)

745
00:37:19,443 --> 00:37:21,776
- Well, you deserve it, man.

746
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:26,313
(birds chirping)

747
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:35,261
(lips smacking)

748
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:42,134
(John breathing heavily)

749
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,975
(John laughs)

750
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:49,642
(lips smacking)

751
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,318
(Ian laughing)

752
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:57,615
(Ian laughing)

753
00:37:57,615 --> 00:38:00,282
(lips smacking)

754
00:38:01,674 --> 00:38:04,341
(lips smacking)

755
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:08,312
- [Doc] We got a mission.

756
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:11,979
(dramatic music continues)

757
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,009
- What about Tet?

758
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:19,961
(birds chirping)

759
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:22,961
(Ian sighs)

760
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:25,972
(clothes rustling)

761
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:29,055
(footsteps plodding)

762
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,852
(birds chirping)

763
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:35,019
(footsteps plodding)

764
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,680
- It's a Sneaky Pete mission.

765
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,189
I went to supply to get HE rounds,

766
00:38:41,189 --> 00:38:43,809
and they got zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

767
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:44,642
We better hoping to go

768
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:47,809
in blind, deaf, and stupid during Tet.

769
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:52,174
- [Ian] Somebody fucked up.

770
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,863
We have to have a ammo.

771
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:56,613
- Battalion wants you five jokers

772
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,344
for a Phoenix mission,

773
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,233
grab a VC province official.

774
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:09,075
They think he can lead us to the local VC

775
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:13,180
that are acting as scouts for the NVA.

776
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,751
(Ian sighs)

777
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:17,900
- First Sergeant, we're
not special forces.

778
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,909
That's CIA business.

779
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:21,962
(saliva sputtering)

780
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:23,888
- I know that Alexander,

781
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,779
and I don't need you to tell me that.

782
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:30,862
This comes directly from
the battalion commander,

783
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:34,811
in other words, from fucking God.

784
00:39:36,861 --> 00:39:39,480
Whole world is on leave for Tet,

785
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,397
ARVN, half our company.

786
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:44,370
You are it.

787
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:48,542
- What about the Tet truce?

788
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:51,233
(Schott laughs)

789
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:53,892
- Lieutenant Holis has been promoted.

790
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,502
(Ian sighs)

791
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:56,873
Captain Heinrick,

792
00:39:56,873 --> 00:40:01,272
a special forces type, will
be joining you in the field.

793
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:02,772
- Yeah, we fucked.

794
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:09,549
- (scoffs) A captain, a
special forces captain?

795
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:10,541
Oh, shit.

796
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,699
- You will salute him, call him sir,

797
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:19,366
and you will not let
him do anything stupid.

798
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:22,850
(birds chirping)

799
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,701
S-3 says the NVA are crossing
into Quang Tri Province.

800
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:29,201
Stay on the radio.

801
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,269
We will get you out

802
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,852
if you run into anything
you cannot handle.

803
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:36,799
(Ian sighs)

804
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,632
(birds chirping)

805
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,715
(footsteps plodding)

806
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,620
- Recall the last Tet truce, gentleman?

807
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:49,453
The NVA handed us our shit in
a bag in them goddamn hills.

808
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:52,300
(helicopter whirring)

809
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,591
- These are the artillery frequencies

810
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:55,909
and pre-planned coordinates.

811
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:58,159
Johnny, better memorize it.

812
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,140
- Got your bubblegum, you ready to go?

813
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,973
(paper thudding)

814
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:01,974
- All set, minus the fact

815
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:05,835
that supply said they have no M-60 rounds.

816
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:07,724
- First Sergeant said check under his bed.

817
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:08,557
I'll go get 'em.

818
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:09,996
- Thanks.

819
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:11,065
Thump, you got a canister?

820
00:41:11,065 --> 00:41:12,164
- Ah, I'll trade, uh, some your weed

821
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:14,262
for 15 rounds from Trunk Company, boy.

822
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:15,200
(soldiers laughing)

823
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,252
- Except for that Phoenix bullshit.

824
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:19,321
We're gonna sneak into some
fucking village, grab Charlie,

825
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:22,040
slap his uncle, bring his ass back here.

826
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,262
ARVN'll torture him, he'll
rat out his VC compadres

827
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:27,364
and become our last little fucking buddy.

828
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:28,197
- Oh, you know it.

829
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,924
He gonna be our Kit Carson
scout, boy (laughs).

830
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:30,757
(gear clanging)
- Hey, there, pussies.

831
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:32,954
(switch clicking)
(metal clanking)

832
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:33,787
(helicopter whirring)

833
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:38,438
(dispatcher speaking indistinctly)

834
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:41,831
- Oh, that's it, Burd, fuck shit up.

835
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:43,581
Goddammit, Burd, ugh.

836
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,860
- [Soldier] Don't fuck it up.

837
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,401
- [Soldier] Got the (indistinct).

838
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:49,350
(soldiers laughing)

839
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,540
- [Soldier] We good,
all right, everyone on?

840
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,857
- [Soldier] We good?

841
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:54,078
- [Soldier] These guys
are fucking bullshit.

842
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:54,911
- [Soldier] Man, wasn't like you was-

843
00:41:54,911 --> 00:41:55,867
- [Soldier] Let's do this.
- with that anyway, fucker.

844
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,355
- [Soldier] Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

845
00:41:58,355 --> 00:42:01,215
(dramatic music)

846
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:04,382
(helicopter whirring)

847
00:42:17,737 --> 00:42:21,320

(birds chirping)

853
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:53,715
(leaves crunching)

854
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,742
(gear clanging)

855
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:04,975
(dramatic music continues)

(dramatic music continues)

860
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:54,800
(lizard thudding)

861
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,456
(Burd grunting)
(gear clanging)

862
00:43:58,456 --> 00:43:59,289
- Fuck Vietnam.

863
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:02,217
(gun clanking)

864
00:44:02,217 --> 00:44:05,800
(dramatic music continues)

865
00:44:20,845 --> 00:44:24,428

(leaves crunching)

868
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:43,160
(dramatic music continues)

869
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:01,440
- Don't point that gun at me.

870
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,190
The enemy's that way.

871
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,467
(feet thudding)

872
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:10,809
(knife clicking)

873
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,059
Gentlemen, name's Heinrick,

874
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:17,441
and you were being
shadowed one click back,

875
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:21,505
though I already took care of one of 'em.

876
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:23,592
- Captain, we've been moving near a trail.

877
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:26,150
Let's set up on the trail
and catch 'em in the dark,

878
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,261
call in artillery, and then scoot.

879
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:33,021
- Must be Reese, man after my own heart.

880
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,410
(birds chirping)

881
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,827
You fight to win.

882
00:45:37,331 --> 00:45:41,251
- [Ian] It's the lead
element of a large force.

883
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:43,918
(gear clanging)

884
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:48,051
(birds chirping)

885
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:51,531
- You must be Alexander.

886
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,997
- Yes, sir.

887
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:59,958
(birds chirping)

888
00:46:01,615 --> 00:46:04,698

00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:29,307
(branch crackling)

(knife slashing)

905
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:53,899

906
00:47:53,899 --> 00:47:56,566
(body thudding)

907
00:47:58,798 --> 00:48:00,819

909
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,907

(gunshots blasting)

916
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:45,556
- Let's give 'em a fight.

917
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:46,934
Then, we'll pull out.

918
00:48:46,934 --> 00:48:47,876
- Roger that.

919
00:48:47,876 --> 00:48:50,876

(gunshots blasting)

948
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:23,085
(dramatic music continues)

949
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:34,086
- Doc, I'm gonna watch him.

950
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:38,537
(leaves crunching)

951
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:42,110

00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,777
(gear clanging)

953
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,710

954
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,710
(crickets chirping)

955
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:57,294

(footsteps plodding)

960
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:18,630
- You like this.

961
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,932
- I like surprising 'em,

962
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:22,849
not that I'll hesitate.

963
00:51:24,113 --> 00:51:26,564
- Outstanding work, sir.

964
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:28,262
There's a fast trail just behind us.

965
00:51:28,262 --> 00:51:29,845
Prisoner was on it.

966
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,353
- Let's move out quick and quiet.

967
00:51:34,353 --> 00:51:35,353
- Fucking A.

968
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:39,525
- Jesus.

969
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:40,358
(Burd laughs)

970
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:41,275
- Let's go.

971
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,540
(leaves rustling)

972
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,252
(dramatic music continues)

973
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:50,530
- Hey, let grab the other 60.

974
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,530
(crickets chirping)

975
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,840
(POW singing)

976
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:08,523
- Sh.

977
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:12,679
(crickets chirping)

978
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:18,963
(bubble popping)

979
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:20,698
- [Soldier] Fucking.

980
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:21,690
(peaceful music)

981
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,023
- You really mean that, hmm?

982
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:30,808
- I'm polite.

983
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:34,435
- Mm.

984
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:37,185
(dramatic music)

985
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:57,847
(dramatic music continues)

986
00:53:02,165 --> 00:53:04,206
- (gasping) Wake up, wake up, wake up.

987
00:53:04,206 --> 00:53:06,373
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

988
00:53:09,057 --> 00:53:12,474
(John breathing heavily)

989
00:53:15,657 --> 00:53:17,414
- I want you-
- Hey.

990
00:53:17,414 --> 00:53:18,831
- No, look at me.

991
00:53:20,003 --> 00:53:22,086
I want you to leave here.

992
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:24,143
(Ian exhales)

993
00:53:24,143 --> 00:53:26,810
Take off from the rest, just go.

994
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:29,194
- Sh.

995
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:34,508
You're talking crazy, really a trick.

996
00:53:34,508 --> 00:53:36,948
- No, please, you go back.

997
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:37,781
(Ian exhales)

998
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,628
Go to OCS if you want.

999
00:53:39,628 --> 00:53:42,767
- Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

1000
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:45,434
- You must go, yes, you must go.

1001
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:47,298
- [Ian] I'm not going anywhere.

1002
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:49,280
- [John] You must go.

1003
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,208
Go.

1004
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,958
- I'm right here, I'm right here.

1005
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:58,549
(crickets chirping)

1006
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:00,378
It was just a dream.

1007
00:54:00,378 --> 00:54:03,461
(crickets chirping)

1008
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,125
- I'll marry Crystal.

1009
00:54:13,978 --> 00:54:15,311
- Sure you will,

1010
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:19,841
and have lots of beautiful babies.

1011
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,158
(crickets chirping)

1012
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,818
You will.

1013
00:54:31,818 --> 00:54:34,746
(crickets chirping)

1014
00:54:34,746 --> 00:54:37,663
(clothes rustling)

1015
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,898
(soldiers chattering indistinctly)

1016
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:47,731
(birds chirping)

1017
00:54:48,957 --> 00:54:51,457
- Alexander, you're intuitive.

1018
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:57,647
Know what the enemy's up
to without even seeing him.

1019
00:54:57,647 --> 00:54:59,687
It's very useful.

1020
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:02,349
And Reese, he can, well, he can smell 'em

1021
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:05,682
and hear 'em, uh, like a natural hunter.

1022
00:55:06,697 --> 00:55:11,697
It's nice, but you can't skate
around the fact of killing,

1023
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:13,186
can't pick and choose
who you're gonna kill

1024
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:15,565
just so it makes you feel good.

1025
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:16,398
You show mercy,

1026
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:17,845
and some farmer with a gun is gonna shoot

1027
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:20,095
your boyfriend in the back.

1028
00:55:21,263 --> 00:55:23,643
I know about the two of you, I know.

1029
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:26,560
I do not approve of your situation.

1030
00:55:29,245 --> 00:55:32,168
- The fuck does that mean?

1031
00:55:32,168 --> 00:55:34,699
- You two, strutting around advertising

1032
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:37,557
whatever the fuck it is you advertise.

1033
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:39,474
Army boyfriends, is it?

1034
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:43,731
At least have the decency to hide it.

1035
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:46,968
- But what are you gonna do, Captain?

1036
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,517
(gun clicking)

1037
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:50,877
- You got your orders for OCS,

1038
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:54,460
and I'm gonna have to
approve those orders.

1039
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:59,125
(gravel crunching)

1040
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:11,499
(urine splashing)

1041
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:13,073
(sheath clicking)

1042
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:16,553
(birds chirping)

1043
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:19,803
Hey, find out what that prisoner knows.

1044
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:23,021
You speak Vietnamese, right?

1045
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:27,547
(pants zipping)

1046
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:28,705
(map rustling)

1047
00:56:28,705 --> 00:56:31,788
(footsteps plodding)

1048
00:56:34,036 --> 00:56:36,619
(map rustling)

1049
00:56:39,036 --> 00:56:41,673
(John whispering in foreign language)

1050
00:56:41,673 --> 00:56:44,415
(finger tapping)

1051
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:45,248
(POW whispering in foreign language)

1052
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:46,081
(map thudding)

1053
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:49,831
(POW whispering in foreign language)

1054
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:52,581
(finger tapping)

1055
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:56,314
(map rustling)

1056
00:56:58,491 --> 00:56:59,331
- [Soldier] Sorry about that.

1057
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:00,497
- [Soldier] It's all right (indistinct).

1058
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:02,188
(footsteps plodding)

1059
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:03,515
- [Soldier] Anything good?

1060
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:06,097
- Hey, don't fuck with me, okay?

1061
00:57:06,097 --> 00:57:07,430
What did he say?

1062
00:57:08,897 --> 00:57:11,228
- He's on a recon patrol,

1063
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:15,228
at least 1,000 NVA
approaching Quang Tri City

1064
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:17,561
and more headed to take Hue,

1065
00:57:19,256 --> 00:57:21,878
and he says he misses his girlfriend.

1066
00:57:21,878 --> 00:57:24,867
- I'll bet he does, little fucker.

1067
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:27,348
- I'll long Quang Tri.

1068
00:57:27,348 --> 00:57:30,431
(footsteps plodding)

1069
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:34,197
(birds chirping)

1070
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:37,334
(lighter clicking)

1071
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:40,501
Fat Lady One, this is Rover Two, over.

1072
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:46,545
Fat Lady One, this is Rover Two, over.

1073
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:47,585
- [Fat Lady One] One, two.

1074
00:57:47,585 --> 00:57:51,545
- We have one, zero, zero,
zero, November, Victor, Alpha

1075
00:57:51,545 --> 00:57:55,153
approaching Ben Lot from
an undisclosed location.

1076
00:57:55,153 --> 00:57:59,425
At this very moment, we're
eight clicks south of Ben Lot.

1077
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:02,163
Are helicopters available?

1078
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:04,294
- [Fat Lady One] Negative
extract, top six.

1079
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:05,466
Continue mission, over.

1080
00:58:05,466 --> 00:58:06,357
- What the fuck?

1081
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,736
Thanks a fucking lot.
(map snapping)

1082
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:12,236
(radio clanking)

1083
00:58:12,236 --> 00:58:17,236
They say thanks for the heads
up, no helicopters available.

1084
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:20,607
(birds chirping)

1085
00:58:21,738 --> 00:58:24,920
- The NVA are attacking about here.

1086
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,899
We wait for dark, cross
their line of attack,

1087
00:58:28,899 --> 00:58:31,208
and get extracted when
choppers are available.

1088
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,040
- [Heinrick] No, we finish our mission.

1089
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,348
We take away their tour guides to Hue.

1090
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:37,749
- (laughs) That's all well and good, sir,

1091
00:58:37,749 --> 00:58:41,440
if it weren't for a
regiment of regular NVA.

1092
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,857
- We will finish our mission.

1093
00:58:45,008 --> 00:58:47,339
- Not if it means we all die.

1094
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,251
We have a prisoner with intel.

1095
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:52,584
(Ian breathing heavily)

1096
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,400
(dramatic music)

1097
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,733
Hey, he's a POW.

1098
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,158
(gear clanging)

1099
00:59:02,158 --> 00:59:03,825
- [Burd] He's right.

1100
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:07,680
(POW breathing heavily)

1101
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,513
- Ian.

1102
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,299
(gear clanging)

1103
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,230
(POW whimpering)

1104
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,397
- [Heinrick] Not so tough.

1105
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:21,931
(gun clicking)
(POW gasping)

1106
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,822
(body thudding)

1107
00:59:23,822 --> 00:59:26,072
- [Burd] It had to be done.

1108
00:59:27,495 --> 00:59:29,520
(gear clanging)

1109
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,823
(dramatic music continues)

1110
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:32,783
- It's called murder.

1111
00:59:32,783 --> 00:59:35,012
- I call that leadership.

1112
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:38,131
You and your friend here
wanna sweat the details.

1113
00:59:38,131 --> 00:59:42,798
- (sighs) Americans fight by the rules.

1114
00:59:44,132 --> 00:59:48,262
- You fight by the rules,
you will lose this war.

1115
00:59:48,262 --> 00:59:51,845
(dramatic music continues)

1116
00:59:52,804 --> 00:59:54,721
- I'm with the captain.

1117
01:00:01,738 --> 01:00:05,999
Thump, I had to kill the
kids they used as shields

1118
01:00:05,999 --> 01:00:08,057
when they assaulted that hill.

1119
01:00:08,057 --> 01:00:11,057
- [Thumper] Yes, you had to do that,

1120
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:16,019
but that soldier didn't need to be killed.

1121
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:20,949
Nah, there's something
broken inside the cat.

1122
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:23,866
(clothes rustling)

1123
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:29,044
- Johnny, he's a psycho
(breathing heavily).

1124
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:31,060
I have to stop him.

1125
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,118
- Yeah?

1126
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:34,118
How's that gonna look on your record?

1127
01:00:34,118 --> 01:00:34,951
- I don't know.

1128
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:36,598
You love this boy?

1129
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:37,431
You wanna go home with him,

1130
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:40,417
you gotta do something
about this damn cap'n.

1131
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:42,696
- He's an officer, okay?

1132
01:00:42,696 --> 01:00:43,635
He makes the big money.

1133
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:45,367
It's his call.

1134
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:49,476
- We can't go up against
no regiment of NVA.

1135
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:50,309
(saliva sputtering)

1136
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:51,625
- What?

1137
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:52,993
You're in the army.

1138
01:00:52,993 --> 01:00:54,444
It's dangerous.

1139
01:00:54,444 --> 01:00:55,861
We follow orders.

1140
01:00:57,084 --> 01:00:58,167
- Look at me.

1141
01:00:59,919 --> 01:01:02,729
Look at me when you say
some shit like that.

1142
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:03,896
This is wrong.

1143
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:08,576
(dramatic music continues)

1144
01:01:08,576 --> 01:01:10,399
No, we need to leave this place,

1145
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:12,346
or we gonna end up being paddy manure

1146
01:01:12,346 --> 01:01:16,682
and for nothing but some
Sneaky Pete mission.

1147
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:18,988
(footsteps plodding)

1148
01:01:18,988 --> 01:01:22,159
- Thank you for your loyalty, Sergeant.

1149
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:26,138
We move out for Ben Lot
to the free-fire zone.

1150
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:28,487
(dramatic music continues)

1151
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:31,977
- [Thumper] Nah, brother,
we don't need this shit.

1152
01:01:31,977 --> 01:01:34,444
- Heinrick just got us
out of a tight situation.

1153
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,876
- No, you got us out
of the tight situation.

1154
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:41,156
Heinrick is the kind of officer
that gets us all killed.

1155
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,865
- [John] Yeah, well guess what.

1156
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,365
We ain't got a fucking choice.

1157
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:47,919
Gimme my gun.

1158
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:53,058
(footsteps plodding)

1159
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:07,584
(footsteps plodding)

1160
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:14,225
(wind howling)

1161
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:15,551
(footsteps plodding)

1162
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,301
(dramatic music)

1163
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,320
(gear clanging)

1164
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,952
- Y'all smell that?

1165
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:31,160
- Napalm barbecue.

1166
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,327
- Burgers, gasoline grill.

1167
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:36,468
- Makes me hungry.

1168
01:02:37,848 --> 01:02:40,428
(footsteps plodding)

1169
01:02:40,428 --> 01:02:44,566
(dramatic music continues)

1170
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:45,399
- Jesus.

1171
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:49,743
- Just a body.

1172
01:02:49,743 --> 01:02:52,207
Don't mean anything.

1173
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:55,790
(dramatic music continues)

1174
01:02:56,932 --> 01:02:57,765
Sir.

1175
01:02:59,684 --> 01:03:01,151
(footsteps plodding)

1176
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:01,984
Sir.

1177
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:07,786
Sir.

1178
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:13,116
(dramatic music continues)

1179
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,626
Sir.

1180
01:03:19,593 --> 01:03:22,176
(wind howling)

1181
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:28,903
Um, it's a, it's a dog,
for God's sake. I don't...

1182
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:30,986
- Artillery and clusters.

1183
01:03:32,153 --> 01:03:33,777
God-blessed horror.

1184
01:03:33,777 --> 01:03:35,448
(fire crackling)

1185
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:38,865
- Looks like they got caught in the open.

1186
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:43,490
- Hey, spread out and keep your eyes open.

1187
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:47,347
- Efficient work.

1188
01:03:47,347 --> 01:03:50,848
(dramatic music continues)

1189
01:03:50,848 --> 01:03:53,598
(fire crackling)

1190
01:03:57,579 --> 01:03:59,688
- Heinrick knows about us?

1191
01:03:59,688 --> 01:04:01,629
- He needs us.

1192
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,129
- When he doesn't?

1193
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:07,539
- You are thinking about our future.

1194
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:11,948
(water sloshing)

1195
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:16,327
(dramatic music continues)

1196
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:19,131
(footsteps plodding)

1197
01:04:19,131 --> 01:04:22,240
- [Heinrick] NVA hit-list
work, settling scores.

1198
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,651
The closer we get to Hue,

1199
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,976
the more the bodies will start piling up,

1200
01:04:25,976 --> 01:04:30,248
(breathing heavily) nurses, priests.

1201
01:04:30,248 --> 01:04:33,659
(dramatic music continues)

1202
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:36,409
(fire crackling)

1203
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,939
(dramatic music continues)

1204
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:55,689
(fire crackling)

1205
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:02,772
- Why did the captain kill him?

1206
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:05,884
- [Heinrick] Over here.

1207
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:10,457
- [Doc] Hey.
(footsteps plodding)

1208
01:05:10,457 --> 01:05:11,917
Why did you kill him?

1209
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:13,509
- [Heinrick] Private, it's not worth it.

1210
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:14,509
- [Doc] Huh?

1211
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:21,881
- [Heinrick] I don't
give the enemies chances.

1212
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:23,929
- What about mercy?

1213
01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:26,540
(fire crackling)

1214
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,883
(Heinrick breathing heavily)

1215
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,462
- What about it?

1216
01:05:30,462 --> 01:05:33,963
(Heinrick breathing heavily)

1217
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,713
(fire crackling)

1218
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:41,454
(debris crumbling)

1219
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:43,123
(Heinrick breathing heavily)

1220
01:05:43,123 --> 01:05:44,774
Okay.

1221
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,224
(water sloshing)

1222
01:05:47,224 --> 01:05:48,894
- They were in a hurry,

1223
01:05:48,894 --> 01:05:49,872
had to move fast

1224
01:05:49,872 --> 01:05:53,704
before our artillery and
gunships caught 'em in the open.

1225
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:56,631
(footsteps plodding)

1226
01:05:56,631 --> 01:05:57,576
(dramatic music continues)

1227
01:05:57,576 --> 01:06:00,326
(fire crackling)

1228
01:06:05,013 --> 01:06:07,753
(water sloshing)

1229
01:06:07,753 --> 01:06:09,144
- [Thumper] See?

1230
01:06:09,144 --> 01:06:14,144
And you was whining about
it being too cold (laughs).

1231
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:20,099
(dramatic music continues)

1232
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,896
(water sloshing)

1233
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:31,414
(boy slurping)

1234
01:06:36,554 --> 01:06:40,137
(dramatic music continues)

1235
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:45,677
(footsteps plodding)

1236
01:06:46,594 --> 01:06:49,344
(birds chirping)

1237
01:06:57,571 --> 01:07:00,404
(birds chirping)

1238
01:07:04,223 --> 01:07:06,890
(John slurping)

1239
01:07:09,802 --> 01:07:12,469
(John slurping)

1240
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,933
(footsteps plodding)

1241
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,127
- Kill him.

1242
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:29,850
He's gonna tell his people we're here.

1243
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:30,683
(dramatic music continues)

1244
01:07:30,683 --> 01:07:33,766
- [Ian] They already know we're here.

1245
01:07:35,694 --> 01:07:37,243
- This guy's cold.

1246
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:38,443
- Frozen.

1247
01:07:38,443 --> 01:07:41,915
- Just arrest him for
killing that NVA prisoner.

1248
01:07:41,915 --> 01:07:43,248
You can do that.

1249
01:07:47,294 --> 01:07:49,203
CO threatens us all the
time with court marshal

1250
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:50,744
if we kill prisoners.

1251
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:51,577
- Exactly.

1252
01:07:55,326 --> 01:07:56,159
(footsteps plodding)
(barrel thudding)

1253
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,209
- [Soldier] Whoa.
(water sloshing)

1254
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:03,792
(dramatic music continues)

1255
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,459
(footsteps plodding)

1256
01:08:12,459 --> 01:08:15,177
- Four clicks from Ben Lot.

1257
01:08:15,177 --> 01:08:16,550
- Cap'n, we need water.

1258
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,510
There's a stream back there.

1259
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,660
- I'm gonna stay here until dawn,

1260
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,190
get our boys into Ben Lot,

1261
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:27,038
back in time for Alexander's R&R.

1262
01:08:27,038 --> 01:08:29,488
- If we get into a
firefight in that village,

1263
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:30,710
the NVA will find us-

1264
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,278
- Move out.

1265
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:35,529
(footsteps plodding)

1266
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,362
(birds chirping)

1267
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,361
- (inhales) Ah, it's these socks.

1268
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:45,809
Ain't no good.

1269
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:50,476
(breathing heavily) Can't keep 'em dry.

1270
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,343
- Thump.

1271
01:08:54,401 --> 01:08:55,369
(socks thudding)

1272
01:08:55,369 --> 01:08:56,510
- Hmm.

1273
01:08:56,510 --> 01:09:01,510
(birds chirping)
(water flowing)

1274
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:04,762
(gear clanging)

1275
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:10,130
- Boys, NVA and VC are
attacking all over the country,

1276
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:14,650
Quang Tri, Dong Ha, Hue, all under attack.

1277
01:09:15,548 --> 01:09:20,421
VC sappers have taken control
of the embassy in Saigon,

1278
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:23,772
no helicopters or artillery in sight.

1279
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:26,262
(water flowing)

1280
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:29,572
(sighs) Fuck.

1281
01:09:29,572 --> 01:09:32,322
(birds chirping)

1282
01:09:34,932 --> 01:09:35,765
- Burd.

1283
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:43,148
(water flowing)
(birds chirping)

1284
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:47,348
(footsteps plodding)

1285
01:09:47,348 --> 01:09:50,015
(water flowing)

1286
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:56,764
(clothes rustling)

1287
01:09:57,935 --> 01:09:59,655
(gun clinking)

1288
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:02,405
(dramatic music)

1289
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:06,016
(birds chirping)

1290
01:10:17,485 --> 01:10:19,568
Why can't we be a family?

1291
01:10:21,474 --> 01:10:23,891
- Queers don't have families.

1292
01:10:26,474 --> 01:10:27,807
- Well, why not?

1293
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:31,125
- 'Cause they're queers.

1294
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,208
That's all we'll ever be.

1295
01:10:34,055 --> 01:10:37,638
(dramatic music continues)

1296
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:46,533
- No, we'd be a real family,
(exhales) you and me.

1297
01:10:54,503 --> 01:10:56,586
- My uncle never married,

1298
01:10:57,602 --> 01:10:59,852
lived with a man on a farm.

1299
01:11:01,074 --> 01:11:03,241
They raised Labrador dogs.

1300
01:11:05,234 --> 01:11:08,173
People always tried to run 'em out.

1301
01:11:08,173 --> 01:11:11,756
(dramatic music continues)

1302
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:17,398
Finally, the neighbors shot
the dogs, and my uncle left.

1303
01:11:20,354 --> 01:11:22,187
I never saw him again.

1304
01:11:27,442 --> 01:11:31,025
(dramatic music continues)

1305
01:11:35,293 --> 01:11:37,876
(gun thudding)

1306
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:44,482
(clothes rustling)

1307
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:47,649
Promise me you'll leave when I say to.

1308
01:11:48,572 --> 01:11:49,423
Please.

1309
01:11:49,423 --> 01:11:53,006
(dramatic music continues)

1310
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:12,381
- We'll arrest Heinrick and
bring him back for trial.

1311
01:12:12,381 --> 01:12:15,964
(dramatic music continues)

1312
01:12:21,448 --> 01:12:25,115
(dramatic music continues)

1313
01:12:26,785 --> 01:12:29,785
(Heinrick sniffing)

1314
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:39,375
(clothes rustling)

1315
01:12:42,117 --> 01:12:44,826
(airplane humming)

1316
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:47,993
(helicopter whirring)

1317
01:12:52,298 --> 01:12:54,357
- [Ian] Day number three.

1318
01:12:54,357 --> 01:12:56,024
- Third day of what?

1319
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:02,052
- Third day out, like
the monk said, peril.

1320
01:13:04,138 --> 01:13:07,338
- Every day is a freaking
day of peril out here.

1321
01:13:07,338 --> 01:13:09,508
(metal clanking)

1322
01:13:09,508 --> 01:13:10,925
- That's our guy.

1323
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:13,768
He's a dead man.

1324
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:15,018
They're all VC.

1325
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:24,093
- Our orders are to bring him
back alive for questioning.

1326
01:13:24,093 --> 01:13:25,343
- The man's VC.

1327
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:27,927
Family's VC.

1328
01:13:27,927 --> 01:13:29,844
They're all fucking VC.

1329
01:13:31,338 --> 01:13:35,005
- Let's do this job
quickly and get it done.

1330
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:40,023
Alexander, use that 60 on the main group.

1331
01:13:40,023 --> 01:13:41,473
(dramatic music continues)

1332
01:13:41,473 --> 01:13:45,640
The rest of you, kill
anybody who tries to escape,

1333
01:13:47,111 --> 01:13:50,398
and then we burn the village down.

1334
01:13:50,398 --> 01:13:53,981
- We do it quick, and we go home, guys.

1335
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:55,781
Captain's right.

1336
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,448
- (exhales) No.

1337
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:01,499
This stops here.

1338
01:14:01,499 --> 01:14:06,499
(dramatic music continues)
(Ian breathing heavily)

1339
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:12,744
(Ian breathing heavily)

1340
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:13,577
Heinrick.

1341
01:14:14,695 --> 01:14:18,362
(dramatic music continues)

1342
01:14:20,114 --> 01:14:23,474
You are under arrest for the
killing of an unarmed prisoner

1343
01:14:23,474 --> 01:14:27,696
and for the illegal
order to kill civilians.

1344
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:30,155
- You guys think these
people are civilians?

1345
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:34,113
(footsteps plodding)

1346
01:14:34,113 --> 01:14:36,137
Let's get the job done.

1347
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:37,326
(footsteps plodding)

1348
01:14:37,326 --> 01:14:38,796
- Sarge, they're VC.

1349
01:14:38,796 --> 01:14:40,296
You know they are.

1350
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:47,737
- You're finished, Heinrick.

1351
01:14:47,737 --> 01:14:51,320
(dramatic music continues)

1352
01:14:54,465 --> 01:14:57,132
(gear clanging)

1353
01:15:00,446 --> 01:15:02,388
(bag thudding)

1354
01:15:02,388 --> 01:15:05,221
(button clicking)

1355
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:10,168
(gun thudding)

1356
01:15:10,168 --> 01:15:13,001
(Heinrick laughs)

1357
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:16,205
(leaves crunching)

1358
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:17,705
- You know, Reese,

1359
01:15:19,777 --> 01:15:22,116
he's made you soft.

1360
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:25,699
(dramatic music continues)

1361
01:15:29,678 --> 01:15:32,057
- Go fuck yourself.

1362
01:15:32,057 --> 01:15:32,890
(hand thudding)

1363
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:34,577
- You're not gonna shoot me.

1364
01:15:34,577 --> 01:15:36,626
You're too good of a soldier.

1365
01:15:36,626 --> 01:15:38,617
(gun clanking)

1366
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,450
(head thudding)
(Heinrick grunting)

1367
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:40,764
(footsteps plodding)

1368
01:15:40,764 --> 01:15:43,206
(gear clanging)

1369
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,977
(soldiers grunting)

1370
01:15:45,977 --> 01:15:46,810
(body thudding)

1371
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:47,995
(John groaning)

1372
01:15:47,995 --> 01:15:48,828
(body thudding)

1373
01:15:48,828 --> 01:15:49,945
(soldiers grunting)

1374
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,006
(fist thudding)

1375
01:15:51,006 --> 01:15:52,595
(soldiers grunting)

1376
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:54,025
(revolver clanking)

1377
01:15:54,025 --> 01:15:55,131
(revolver thudding)

1378
01:15:55,131 --> 01:15:58,881
(soldiers breathing heavily)

1379
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,349
- Are you okay?

1380
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,082
(soldiers breathing heavily)

1381
01:16:04,082 --> 01:16:06,999
(clothes rustling)

1382
01:16:10,318 --> 01:16:13,478
(saliva sputtering)

1383
01:16:13,478 --> 01:16:17,311
(soldiers breathing heavily)

1384
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:21,777
(cigarettes thudding)

1385
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:27,328
(soldiers breathing heavily)

1386
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:33,386
(feet shuffling)
- Captain is my prisoner.

1387
01:16:33,386 --> 01:16:35,687
(Ian breathing heavily)

1388
01:16:35,687 --> 01:16:39,047
None of you had anything to do with this.

1389
01:16:39,047 --> 01:16:42,549
- (scoffs) Really?

1390
01:16:42,549 --> 01:16:43,382
(hand patting)

1391
01:16:43,382 --> 01:16:44,709
I just knocked him out cold.

1392
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:45,542
I mean, is that...

1393
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:47,399
(hands patting)

1394
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:48,649
- The ghoulies.

1395
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:53,289
(footsteps plodding)

1396
01:16:54,736 --> 01:16:55,986
- [John] Where?

1397
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:59,961
(footsteps plodding)

1398
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:06,863
(gear clanging)

1399
01:17:09,307 --> 01:17:12,345
(gear clanging)

1400
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:15,095
(gear clanging)

1401
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:21,446
(birds chirping)

1402
01:17:21,446 --> 01:17:24,126
(gear clanging)

1403
01:17:24,126 --> 01:17:26,876
(birds chirping)

1404
01:17:29,141 --> 01:17:32,153
(leaves crunching)

1405
01:17:32,153 --> 01:17:34,903
(birds chirping)

1406
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:39,304
(birds chirping)

1407
01:17:44,299 --> 01:17:47,372
- There goes our escape route.

1408
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:48,205
- Yep.

1409
01:17:51,052 --> 01:17:53,642
(binoculars clanking)

1410
01:17:53,642 --> 01:17:56,572
- Two forces are doing a meetup.

1411
01:17:56,572 --> 01:17:59,322
(birds chirping)

1412
01:18:03,391 --> 01:18:06,212
(leaves rustling)

1413
01:18:06,212 --> 01:18:08,962
(birds chirping)

1414
01:18:16,532 --> 01:18:18,999
Looks like court's in session.

1415
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:20,420
- We think he works for them.

1416
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,871
They think he works for us.

1417
01:18:22,871 --> 01:18:24,442
- Perfect.

1418
01:18:24,442 --> 01:18:27,019
The NVA will do the job for us.

1419
01:18:27,019 --> 01:18:29,750
(Heinrick laughing)

1420
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:32,269
- Shut up, or I'll gag you.

1421
01:18:32,269 --> 01:18:35,019
(birds chirping)

1422
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:47,117
Our mission is to grab the
official and disrupt their plans.

1423
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:49,318
- Fuck the mission.

1424
01:18:49,318 --> 01:18:52,419
(exhales) Let's get out of here.

1425
01:18:52,419 --> 01:18:54,709
- We can attack, or we can run.

1426
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:56,489
There's no good choice.

1427
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:59,169
We move into that village, we're exposed.

1428
01:18:59,169 --> 01:19:02,086
We hide in the trees, we're caught.

1429
01:19:03,979 --> 01:19:08,510
- We attack, at least
we have the initiative.

1430
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:13,099
We get our man and maybe
shock the NVA into hesitating.

1431
01:19:13,099 --> 01:19:15,682
We get a head start for the LZ.

1432
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:19,549
I won't order you.

1433
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,529
- Okay.

1434
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:31,946
Maybe, if we do this together,
we can get outta here.

1435
01:19:33,878 --> 01:19:36,711
- Jesus H. Christ on a pogo stick,

1436
01:19:37,598 --> 01:19:40,419
and the whole NVA
fucking army is out there

1437
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:43,059
within shouting distance.

1438
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:44,476
Let's just leave.

1439
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,700
(birds chirping)

1440
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:52,482
I'm not doing this.

1441
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:56,270
Fuck.

1442
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:59,187
(clothes rustling)

1443
01:20:04,659 --> 01:20:07,339
- Johnny, we'll come with
the sun at our backs.

1444
01:20:07,339 --> 01:20:09,110
They're supporting unit
in the trees won't know

1445
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:11,299
what they're dealing with.

1446
01:20:11,299 --> 01:20:15,558
- (sighs) I don't know (sighs).

1447
01:20:15,558 --> 01:20:18,569
- They're on both sides of us.

1448
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:20,209
They just don't know we're here.

1449
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:22,838
- You guys are so cute.

1450
01:20:22,838 --> 01:20:24,421
- Shut the fuck up.

1451
01:20:26,256 --> 01:20:30,923
- [Fat Lady One] Rover Two,
Fat Lady One, sit-rep, over.

1452
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:34,812
- We're going to our prisoner,

1453
01:20:34,812 --> 01:20:38,002
and then we'll go to LZ
X-ray for extraction.

1454
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:39,210
We'll pop smoke.

1455
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,451
(static buzzing)

1456
01:20:40,451 --> 01:20:42,160
- [Fat Lady One] Lima Charlie, over.

1457
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,480
- Fire support available?

1458
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,257
- [Fat Lady One] Negative, any kind,

1459
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:48,236
a real Charlie foxtrot-
- God.

1460
01:20:48,236 --> 01:20:51,115
- all the way up north, snakes, too.

1461
01:20:51,115 --> 01:20:53,066
Keep defending base.

1462
01:20:53,066 --> 01:20:54,853
You're on your own, brother.

1463
01:20:54,853 --> 01:20:56,936
- Look, John, we grab him

1464
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:02,086
and then get to the LZ X-ray, okay?

1465
01:21:02,086 --> 01:21:03,104
(Ian sighs)

1466
01:21:03,104 --> 01:21:06,806
- You really think I
could let you go alone?

1467
01:21:06,806 --> 01:21:10,389
(dramatic music continues)

1468
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:15,875
(leaves crunching)

1469
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:17,458
- Okay, here we go.

1470
01:21:19,907 --> 01:21:23,907
Burd, make sure the captain
is properly secured.

1471
01:21:26,027 --> 01:21:28,147
(sighs) Do it right.

1472
01:21:28,147 --> 01:21:30,144
- Wanna be a hero, Sarge?

1473
01:21:30,144 --> 01:21:31,622
(footsteps plodding)

1474
01:21:31,622 --> 01:21:32,872
They die young.

1475
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:38,467
You know, a lot has to
go right with your plan.

1476
01:21:38,467 --> 01:21:42,255
(dramatic music continues)

1477
01:21:42,255 --> 01:21:43,088
- Yep.

1478
01:21:44,678 --> 01:21:45,511
- Tommy.

1479
01:21:46,707 --> 01:21:47,736
(leaves rustling)

1480
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,326
(gear clanging)

1481
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:51,377
You're the best shot.

1482
01:21:51,377 --> 01:21:53,715
Get an angle on the woman officer.

1483
01:21:53,715 --> 01:21:56,632
When you drop her, we attack, okay?

1484
01:21:57,794 --> 01:22:00,966
(hand patting)

1485
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:03,885

(dramatic music continues)

1489
01:22:22,683 --> 01:22:26,571
- Use the heavy artillery
in front of our advance.

1490
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:27,488
Use it all.

1491
01:22:28,382 --> 01:22:31,122
They'll think it's mortars.

1492
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:34,539
Bring the prisoner here and cover for us.

1493
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:38,123
(Thumper sighs)

1494
01:22:38,123 --> 01:22:40,971

(footsteps plodding)

1497
01:22:46,443 --> 01:22:47,360
300 rounds.

1498
01:22:49,941 --> 01:22:53,441
- Come left, right at the NVA in the open.

1499
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,371
Avoid the village.

1500
01:22:57,371 --> 01:22:59,788
I'll grab the prisoner, okay?

1501
01:23:01,633 --> 01:23:02,550
Let's move.

1502
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:07,094

(dramatic music continues)

1507
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:30,250
- White, you don't have to do this.

1508
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:35,414
Vietnamese politics,
just let 'em handle it.

1509
01:23:35,414 --> 01:23:39,581
We go back to Quang Tri
City together, stay alive.

1510
01:23:43,305 --> 01:23:44,222
- Sometimes

1511
01:23:47,442 --> 01:23:50,442
you be making the most sense, Cap'n.

1512
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:55,083
(feet shuffling)

1513
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,157
(leaves crunching)

1514
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,547
Just so you know,

1515
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:07,037
I love those boys with my whole heart.

1516
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:12,208
I'm not sure who you care about.

1517
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:15,125
(Thumper exhaling)

1518
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,449
- They're dead.

1519
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:20,562
- Who's dead?

1520
01:24:24,168 --> 01:24:25,001
- My wife.

1521
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:26,772
My son.

1522
01:24:29,418 --> 01:24:30,751
Both Vietnamese.

1523
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,877
- I'm sorry for your loss.

1524
01:24:42,926 --> 01:24:46,048

(clothes rustling)

1528
01:25:03,259 --> 01:25:05,176
Why didn't you go home?

1529
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,053
What kept you here?

1530
01:25:11,828 --> 01:25:14,928
Why didn't you leave this evil damn place?

1531
01:25:14,928 --> 01:25:18,511
(dramatic music continues)

1532
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,413

(hand patting)
(Ian groaning)

1818
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,306
- Fuck off.

1819
01:39:12,306 --> 01:39:14,396
(fist thudding)
(Heinrick groaning)

1820
01:39:14,396 --> 01:39:17,696
(Ian breathing heavily)

1821
01:39:17,696 --> 01:39:20,107
(saliva sputtering)

1822
01:39:20,107 --> 01:39:21,788
(dramatic music continues)

1823
01:39:21,788 --> 01:39:24,316
(helicopter whirring)
- Lights out, inbound,

1824
01:39:24,316 --> 01:39:27,066
landing north, east side, pop it.

1825
01:39:29,364 --> 01:39:32,614
(helicopters whirring)

1826
01:39:40,747 --> 01:39:44,330
(dramatic music continues)

1827
01:39:45,882 --> 01:39:49,049
(helicopter whirring)

1828
01:39:56,706 --> 01:40:00,373
(dramatic music continues)

1829
01:40:05,148 --> 01:40:06,366
- Could I get some help here?

1830
01:40:06,366 --> 01:40:08,949
(Ian grunting)

1831
01:40:10,007 --> 01:40:10,840
(gear clanging)

1832
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:14,749
- [Ian] Hey.
(gunshots blasting)

1833
01:40:14,749 --> 01:40:17,489
- You did, you did good, angel.

1834
01:40:17,489 --> 01:40:18,322
- No.

1835
01:40:22,432 --> 01:40:25,515
- I, take, take me to the rice paddy.

1836
01:40:28,381 --> 01:40:29,798
You know the one.

1837
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,650
And put me in the water,

1838
01:40:33,919 --> 01:40:34,832
(Ian sobbing)

1839
01:40:34,832 --> 01:40:35,915
in the water.

1840
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:39,651
I'll be at peace there.

1841
01:40:39,651 --> 01:40:42,318
(Ian breathing heavily)

1842
01:40:42,318 --> 01:40:43,611
- Johnny.

1843
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:44,528
Johnny, no.

1844
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:49,597
- I always,
(dog tags rattling)

1845
01:40:51,214 --> 01:40:54,297
I always tried to do the right thing.

1846
01:40:56,534 --> 01:40:57,367
- You did.

1847
01:40:57,367 --> 01:40:59,200
- But all, all I ever,

1848
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,995
all I ever wanted was you.

1849
01:41:04,995 --> 01:41:06,864
(Ian sobbing)

1850
01:41:06,864 --> 01:41:08,091
- Johnny, you have me.

1851
01:41:08,091 --> 01:41:10,924
(Johnny groaning)

1852
01:41:13,144 --> 01:41:14,061
No, Johnny.

1853
01:41:17,983 --> 01:41:19,833
(dog tags rattling)

1854
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:22,764
(Ian sobbing)

1855
01:41:22,764 --> 01:41:25,593
(dramatic music continues)

1856
01:41:25,593 --> 01:41:26,426
(clothes rustling)

1857
01:41:26,426 --> 01:41:28,926
(Ian sobbing)

1858
01:41:33,243 --> 01:41:35,743
(Ian sobbing)

1859
01:41:41,391 --> 01:41:45,100
(dramatic music continues)

1860
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:47,330
(Ian sobbing)

1861
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:50,980
(gunshots blasting)

1862
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:53,231
- Sorry about Reese.

1863
01:41:53,231 --> 01:41:55,064
He was a good soldier.

1864
01:41:56,909 --> 01:41:58,849
(gunshots blasting)

1865
01:41:58,849 --> 01:42:00,932
Such a beautiful country.

1866
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:05,257
Listen, it went like this.

1867
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:08,980
We found the VC leader, he resisted,

1868
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,978
we killed him in a firefight.
(gunshots blasting)

1869
01:42:11,978 --> 01:42:14,548
Stick to my story, and all will be well.

1870
01:42:14,548 --> 01:42:16,199
(gunshots blasting)

1871
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:19,388
We gave our fire base
warning of the attack.

1872
01:42:19,388 --> 01:42:20,305
Good stuff.

1873
01:42:21,687 --> 01:42:23,039
And Reesey'll get a medal.

1874
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:24,548
(dramatic music continues)

1875
01:42:24,548 --> 01:42:25,415
- (sobbing) A medal?

1876
01:42:25,415 --> 01:42:26,707
(gunshots blasting)

1877
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:27,587
- Listen, just don't say anything

1878
01:42:27,587 --> 01:42:29,754
about what happened, okay?

1879
01:42:31,147 --> 01:42:32,366
They'll make you an officer.

1880
01:42:32,366 --> 01:42:34,255
(gunshots blasting)

1881
01:42:34,255 --> 01:42:37,838
(dramatic music continues)

1882
01:42:40,355 --> 01:42:43,505
- [Ian] Motherfucking bastard.

1883
01:42:43,505 --> 01:42:46,313
(gunshots blasting)

1884
01:42:46,313 --> 01:42:49,894
(helicopter whirring)

1885
01:42:49,894 --> 01:42:53,477
(dramatic music continues)

1886
01:42:54,443 --> 01:42:57,610
(helicopter whirring)

1887
01:43:07,417 --> 01:43:11,000
(dramatic music continues)

1888
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:19,766
(helicopter whirring)

1889
01:43:27,021 --> 01:43:30,188
(helicopter whirring)

1890
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,627
(feet shuffling)

1891
01:43:43,296 --> 01:43:45,296
- He was my friend, too.

1892
01:43:47,894 --> 01:43:50,956
Two NVA regiments were
delayed by your action.

1893
01:43:50,956 --> 01:43:52,205
(helicopter whistling)

1894
01:43:52,205 --> 01:43:53,866
Gave us time.

1895
01:43:53,866 --> 01:43:57,214
Even then it was a close thing.

1896
01:43:57,214 --> 01:43:58,047
Nice work.

1897
01:44:00,523 --> 01:44:02,440
Tell me what went down.

1898
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:07,908
- First Sergeant,

1899
01:44:09,763 --> 01:44:10,596
(dramatic music)

1900
01:44:10,596 --> 01:44:14,596
we got to the village,
and it was the wrong guy.

1901
01:44:16,963 --> 01:44:18,264
Kept us going through the forests,

1902
01:44:18,264 --> 01:44:20,597
and NVA were picking us off.

1903
01:44:23,245 --> 01:44:25,662
First, we lost Burd, Thumper,

1904
01:44:29,456 --> 01:44:30,577
went back, tried to find him,

1905
01:44:30,577 --> 01:44:34,703
and practically stepped
on him on the path.

1906
01:44:34,703 --> 01:44:36,863
(birds chirping)

1907
01:44:36,863 --> 01:44:40,530
(dramatic music continues)

1908
01:44:44,463 --> 01:44:47,546
(footsteps plodding)

1909
01:44:49,815 --> 01:44:53,398
(dramatic music continues)

1910
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:03,610
(feet shuffling)

1911
01:45:04,876 --> 01:45:09,138
(dramatic music continues)

1912
01:45:09,138 --> 01:45:12,471
(Ian breathing heavily)

1913
01:45:23,468 --> 01:45:27,051
(dramatic music continues)

1914
01:45:30,177 --> 01:45:32,177
(Ian breathing heavily)

1915
01:45:32,177 --> 01:45:34,907
(footsteps plodding)

1916
01:45:34,907 --> 01:45:38,574
(dramatic music continues)

1917
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:46,147
(footsteps plodding)

1918
01:45:46,147 --> 01:45:49,230
(footsteps plodding)

1919
01:45:51,343 --> 01:45:55,010
(dramatic music continues)

1920
01:45:57,326 --> 01:45:59,659
- This will end your career.

1921
01:46:01,585 --> 01:46:04,916
(helicopter whirring)

1922
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:07,916
No one is asking about you and John.

1923
01:46:10,935 --> 01:46:12,602
Just don't tell 'em.

1924
01:46:15,265 --> 01:46:18,015
- I've had enough of being quiet.

1925
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:22,144
(Schott sighs)

1926
01:46:22,144 --> 01:46:24,894
- This will not fly at battalion.

1927
01:46:26,384 --> 01:46:29,013
They'll want to give you all medals.

1928
01:46:29,013 --> 01:46:32,263
They'll promote that rat fuck Heinrick.

1929
01:46:33,281 --> 01:46:36,448
(helicopter whirring)

1930
01:46:38,203 --> 01:46:41,036
Did he, did he really try to kiss?

1931
01:46:48,603 --> 01:46:49,436
Ian.

1932
01:46:52,674 --> 01:46:55,583
John would not want this.

1933
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:58,273
(Ian exhales)

1934
01:46:58,273 --> 01:47:01,606
- Johnny always said I couldn't shut up,

1935
01:47:02,463 --> 01:47:05,161
but I can't keep quiet.

1936
01:47:05,161 --> 01:47:10,161
(exhales) not anymore (sniffs).

1937
01:47:11,192 --> 01:47:12,472
(feet shuffling)

1938
01:47:12,472 --> 01:47:14,191
(footsteps plodding)

1939
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:17,524
(Ian breathing heavily)

1940
01:47:18,533 --> 01:47:21,616
(helicopter buzzing)

1941
01:47:23,914 --> 01:47:27,453
- [Schott] Queer sergeants
in love just sounds

1942
01:47:27,453 --> 01:47:28,870
like porno to me.

1943
01:47:29,962 --> 01:47:31,743
(Ian breathing heavily)

1944
01:47:31,743 --> 01:47:34,562
(footsteps plodding)

1945
01:47:34,562 --> 01:47:37,312
(dramatic music)

1946
01:47:39,943 --> 01:47:41,263
(Ian sniffing)

1947
01:47:41,263 --> 01:47:44,019
(body bag zipping)

1948
01:47:44,019 --> 01:47:44,929
(canvas rustling)

1949
01:47:44,929 --> 01:47:48,262
(Ian breathing heavily)

1950
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:53,041
(helicopters whirring)

1951
01:47:58,118 --> 01:48:00,199
(body bag zipping)

1952
01:48:00,199 --> 01:48:03,782
(dramatic music continues)

1953
01:48:08,671 --> 01:48:11,421
(feet shuffling)

1954
01:48:21,191 --> 01:48:22,774
- The hell is this?

1955
01:48:24,951 --> 01:48:27,451
- My after-action report, sir.

1956
01:48:28,459 --> 01:48:30,542
- I know that, Goddammit.

1957
01:48:32,559 --> 01:48:33,772
- I can explain.

1958
01:48:33,772 --> 01:48:35,355
- Shut up, Captain.

1959
01:48:36,932 --> 01:48:38,932
Did you kill a prisoner,

1960
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:45,680
and did you order the
killing of women and children

1961
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:48,263
and the burning of the village?

1962
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,337
Is the rest true?

1963
01:48:56,812 --> 01:48:57,729
- Yes, sir.

1964
01:49:02,949 --> 01:49:06,032
(footsteps plodding)

1965
01:49:11,068 --> 01:49:13,879
(commander sighs)

1966
01:49:13,879 --> 01:49:16,797
- Your attack on the village
delayed and disrupted

1967
01:49:16,797 --> 01:49:19,297
the 812th regiment of the NVA.

1968
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:24,417
They were amassing to
overrun our base on Dong Ha.

1969
01:49:26,231 --> 01:49:28,892
They were to rendezvous in that village.

1970
01:49:28,892 --> 01:49:32,642
Instead they chased you,
got themselves lost.

1971
01:49:34,711 --> 01:49:38,508
That's what led to their defeat here,

1972
01:49:38,508 --> 01:49:41,049
and the NVA were successful in Hue.

1973
01:49:41,049 --> 01:49:44,210
They still hold the Citadel.

1974
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:46,627
I have orders to remove them.

1975
01:49:48,572 --> 01:49:50,680
(papers rustling)

1976
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:55,311
Your after-action report
on the battle of Dong Ha,

1977
01:49:55,311 --> 01:49:56,802
(papers thudding)

1978
01:49:56,802 --> 01:49:57,635
lost.

1979
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,003
Sergeant Alexander,

1980
01:50:04,322 --> 01:50:07,631
you are promoted to the
rank of second lieutenant

1981
01:50:07,631 --> 01:50:09,420
and ordered to the city of Hue

1982
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:13,532
to take command of the
Third Platoon, B Company.

1983
01:50:13,532 --> 01:50:16,564
Do you accept your
commission and your orders?

1984
01:50:16,564 --> 01:50:17,481
- Yes, sir.

1985
01:50:19,721 --> 01:50:20,554
(dramatic music)

1986
01:50:20,554 --> 01:50:23,971
- Pride, bring me second lieutenant bars.

1987
01:50:24,928 --> 01:50:27,595
- I want Sergeant Reese's ashes.

1988
01:50:34,126 --> 01:50:36,538
(footsteps plodding)

1989
01:50:36,538 --> 01:50:40,538
- You do have the balls
to lead a rifle platoon.

1990
01:50:43,607 --> 01:50:48,157
Pride, Lieutenant Alexander
has been appointed

1991
01:50:48,157 --> 01:50:52,824
with the proper disposition
of Sergeant Reese's remains.

1992
01:50:54,736 --> 01:50:55,616
See to it.

1993
01:50:55,616 --> 01:50:57,245
(dramatic music continues)

1994
01:50:57,245 --> 01:50:59,375
(fingers tapping)

1995
01:50:59,375 --> 01:51:00,213
(door thudding)

1996
01:51:00,213 --> 01:51:03,046
(fingers tapping)

1997
01:51:05,845 --> 01:51:07,262
Captain Heinrick.

1998
01:51:09,583 --> 01:51:11,832
(feet shuffling)
