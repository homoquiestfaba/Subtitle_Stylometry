1
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:21,363
You tell me what that is.

2
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,499
You stay right there. I'll be back.

3
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,233
- Hi, Bernice.
- Miss Olivia.

4
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,673
Hey, you be a good girl.
I'll see you after work.

5
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,834
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

6
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,503
Bye.

7
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:41,178
Bobby, get up.

8
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,642
Eight-thirty?

9
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:09,338
Get out of here. Go on.

10
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,214
Go on. Get.

11
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,783
Look at you.

12
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:18,352
Hey, look at your friend there.

13
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:22,019
Ma, why didn't you even
wake me up?

14
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,558
I should body-slam him.

15
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,424
Hey, man, can...?

16
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,122
- Good morning, Donna.
- Good morning, Mr. Tinsdale.

17
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,691
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:59,328
- Have a nice day.
Waymon.

19
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,087
- David.
- Donna.

20
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:09,771
Drake, Gearson & Burke,
may I help you?

21
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,770
- What was that all about?
- No big deal.

22
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,240
- I thought you two were an item.
- She just couldn't cut it, that's all.

23
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,708
Yeah, right.

24
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:19,403
Sheila, good morning.

25
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:22,210
Have my presentation materials
come up from the mailroom?

26
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:25,286
- Not yet.
- Not yet? Call the mailroom.

27
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,855
How about the conference room?
Have they got chairs?

28
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:30,288
The audio-visual.
Have they set up the projector?

29
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,951
Waymon, will you relax?
I've taken care of everything.

30
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,063
This is the biggest deal
of my career.

31
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,723
I'm aware of that. Why do you think
I've been here since 6:30 this morning?

32
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:41,393
- Get going. Atwell is waiting.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,199
- Good luck.
- Won't need it.

34
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,875
Oh, are you okay?
Can I help you with something?

35
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,483
I fell for you, babe.
How about lunch this afternoon?

36
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,517
You've got to be kidding.

37
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,621
How about dinner tonight?

38
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:02,723
Okay, lunch tomorrow?

39
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,156
How about a frank right now?

40
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,319
Slice of pizza?

41
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,131
Well, well, well.

42
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:12,859
Hey, hey.

43
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,601
- What happened last night?
- Don't know about you...

44
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:17,865
...brothers like me
gotta work in the morning.

45
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,805
- You see I'm in the house.
- Yeah, but you late in the house.

46
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:23,844
- Hey, but I'm in here.
- I don't see how you do it, man.

47
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,073
Stay out all night long
and come in here and be up all day.

48
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,981
Me, I gotta be home by 12 midnight
if I gotta face Monroe in the morning.

49
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,746
Hey, as far as I'm concerned...

50
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:36,449
...Monroe can get the bozac,
you know what I'm saying?

51
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,856
Johnson, you wouldn't happen to be
just getting here at 9:15?

52
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,459
No, homey, I was on time.

53
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,932
You didn't see me.
I was back there getting busy.

54
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,196
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

55
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,862
- Well...
- Watch it.

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,873
I am not one of your tack-head cronies.

57
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,002
I'm the boss.
The head nigga in charge.

58
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,376
Now, you get
your late ass to work, pronto.

59
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,518
Don't forget that package
for Mr. Tinsdale.

60
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,812
It was supposed to be on his desk
first thing.

61
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,853
Guess who had to take the heat
over that?

62
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,650
But no more, Johnson.

63
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,486
No more.

64
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,492
- Homey don't play that.
- You watch too much TV, man.

65
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,963
No, I'm serious, man.
Monroe don't play no games.

66
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:21,126
Yeah, well, neither do I.
I'm tired of this punk shit, man.

67
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:24,102
I came here to be a real-estate broker,
not no damn mail boy.

68
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:25,797
- I'm moving up.
- Up where?

69
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,840
Upstairs. Land of suit and ties.

70
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,809
Power lunches,
more girls than you can stand.

71
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,413
I'm getting paid in full.

72
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,914
Waymon Tinsdale's supposed
to help you get there?

73
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,520
- That's right. Because that's my boy.
- Your boy? Man, don't make me laugh.

74
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,349
Your boy
was supposed to help you...

75
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,616
...get in that training program
two years ago.

76
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,919
You ain't
but a late-in-the-house dreamer.

77
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,155
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Yeah, that's what you think.

78
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:55,164
Boy just don't know
when he got it good, do he?

79
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,936
Gentlemen, real estate
in New York City is at an all-time low.

80
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,878
Overbuilding and the soft economy...

81
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,348
...have caused a record number
of foreclosures...

82
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,043
...in New York in the last year.

83
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:16,490
Now, the good news
is that the opportunities for cash buyers...

84
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:19,719
...with the ability to wait out
this temporary market correction...

85
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,295
...never been better.

86
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,864
Gentlemen, if you please.

87
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,164
We believe the Savoy Tower property...

88
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:29,532
...is the most spectacular opportunity
of its kind in New York today.

89
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:32,902
There isn't a foreclosure property
of this size in the city...

90
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:34,839
...with a better return on investment.

91
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:38,378
And Mr. Atwell and the First Manhattan Bank
are prepared to negotiate...

92
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,743
...around-the-clock to close the deal
this week.

93
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,181
That is, if you're prepared
to make an offer now.

94
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,217
We've reviewed
your proposal carefully...

95
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:46,980
...and we're extremely interested.

96
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,522
However, before we can make
a formal offer...

97
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,752
...we need detailed
15-year financial projections.

98
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,588
Fifteen years?

99
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,823
Yes. If the figures
meet our requirement...

100
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,229
...we're prepared
to close the deal immediately.

101
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,630
I understand.

102
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,703
You'll have the projections
by Wednesday.

103
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:06,000
If you have a minute, I'd like you
to meet our president, Mr. Drake.

104
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,199
Excuse me.

105
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,708
One of the unique features
of this property...

106
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,171
Terrific, Waymon.
Don't let them move.

107
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,010
I'm on my way.

108
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:17,576
As I was saying...
- Excuse me, David.

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,512
We'll have to continue this later.

110
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,452
Something important has come up.

111
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:25,025
Listen, why don't you
reschedule with Peg, huh?

112
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,821
Sure.

113
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:29,021
Okay, I...

114
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,166
- Hey, Bobby.
- Gary.

115
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,428
Doing up here
fronting in that weak-ass suit?

116
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,732
Better get your Dr. Doolittle ass
upstairs before Monroe busts you.

117
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,307
What are you talking about?
I'm out of the mailroom.

118
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,239
I'm in the training program now.

119
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,673
You?

120
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,747
<i>Training program?
What is this, the Twilight Zone?</i>

121
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,908
I've been trying to get in that program
since I started this gig.

122
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,486
- How you get in?
- David Barnes.

123
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:53,917
He liked my initiative.

124
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,058
Initiative? What initiative?

125
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,856
Hey, why you jumping
all over me, man?

126
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,223
It's not my fault that I'm in
and you're not.

127
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:04,493
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, man, congrats.

128
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,225
Like I always said:

129
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,235
"If you wanna make a power move,
you gotta have a hook-up. "

130
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,930
You go for yours.
I'll damn sure go for mine.

131
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:22,413
Wednesday. Wednesday.

132
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,985
- Perfect.
- I had a good teacher.

133
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,587
The presentation was excellent.

134
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,666
But I'm concerned
about those projections.

135
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,201
Don't be. The guy was taking advantage
of the soft market.

136
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,302
He closed two foreclosure deals
in Los Angeles last month.

137
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:49,706
This property is a steal.
And he knows it. Trust me.

138
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,440
Cafe 43.

139
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,375
Yeah. Yes, he is.

140
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,418
Sure. No problem.

141
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,221
Listen, Mr. Atwell needs
to call his office.

142
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,722
- He's at Table 6.
- Okay.

143
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:07,385
Closing this deal is important
to the bank and to you.

144
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:10,031
Yes, I know.

145
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:34,815
Excuse me.

146
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,721
Mr. Atwell, there's a call for you.

147
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,515
I think you owe me
an explanation, missy.

148
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,453
Coming half an hour late
in the middle of the lunch rush.

149
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,093
There must have been 100 people
at that audition.

150
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,592
- Audition?
- Yes.

151
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:16,960
If you had your priorities straight
you would have been here on time.

152
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,294
I tried to get here on time.
Really, I did.

153
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:22,232
I don't care.
if you would have left earlier...

154
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,568
...then I wouldn't be here
trying to be manager and hostess.

155
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,801
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.
It'll never, ever happen again.

156
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:34,041
Oh, I know it won't happen again
since I will have to fire you, missy.

157
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,246
Oh, come on, Russ.

158
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,011
You know how much I need this job.

159
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,451
It's too late for begging, missy.
You're over.

160
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:42,955
Missy? I have a name.

161
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,855
- Use it.
- Lower your voice.

162
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,553
I will do whatever the hell
I wanna do...

163
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,996
...because I've had it with you
and this trifling job.

164
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,567
I don't need this shit.

165
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,968
It's not my career, unlike yourself,
Mr. Professional-Ass-Kisser.

166
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,607
You're fired!

167
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:01,299
Get out.

168
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,101
With pleasure.

169
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,479
Thanks.

170
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,184
Miss.

171
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,458
Is something wrong, sir?

172
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,465
Hm? Uh...

173
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,097
No. We're ready to order. Thank you.

174
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,740
I don't look like a broker to you?

175
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,645
That goes to show
how much you know...

176
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:44,809
...about the world
of real estate, baby.

177
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:46,454
A lot of us wear sneakers.

178
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,887
It's a fast-moving game,
you just got to be able to keep up.

179
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,924
Well, look, if you can't keep up,
I'm gonna have to step off.

180
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,653
Step off now.

181
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,889
It's cool, homey.
Just a minute, all right?

182
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,695
Yeah, so, if...

183
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,168
Hello? Hello, Tonya?

184
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,204
Man, what's up with that shit, man?

185
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:07,308
- I was almost in there.
In where?

186
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,465
In there, man.

187
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,976
You wouldn't know nothing about that,
so squash it.

188
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,341
You know...

189
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:16,713
...I am getting real tired of you
constantly abusing my friendship.

190
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:18,979
I try to do things for you
whenever I can.

191
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,055
And still, you pull stunts like this.

192
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,554
Like what?

193
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:27,424
Like what? Like using my office
as your own personal cafeteria.

194
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,996
- Suppose I had been with a client.
- But you weren't.

195
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,827
But suppose I was.

196
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,334
This place smells
like a fast-food explosion.

197
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,267
So open up a window
or something, man.

198
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,374
I came here to talk to you for a reason.

199
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,804
What now?

200
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,739
Training program, man.

201
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:45,403
- You was gonna hook me up.
- I did nothing of the sort.

202
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,572
You asked me about it,
I told you. Simple.

203
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,514
You said you was gonna help me.
Don't front on me like that.

204
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,551
Even if that was true, which it's not...

205
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,019
...they aren't accepting
any new trainees now.

206
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,524
That's bullshit. My boy Gary O'Hara
just made the cut.

207
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,356
Well, Gary went to St. John's University.

208
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,724
I went to school too.

209
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,765
Community college.
Not exactly the same thing.

210
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,800
This is bogus.
Why you illing like that?

211
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,133
Now, see? That is what
I am talking about.

212
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:12,535
"llling"?

213
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,506
What kind of word is that?
Look at the way you're dressed.

214
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,772
I work in the mailroom. What am I
supposed to wear, Armani suit?

215
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,006
No.

216
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:23,083
But you don't have to speak
and dress so...

217
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,152
So... How do I put this?

218
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,918
- Black?
- Well, yes, black.

219
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,660
You know what, G?

220
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:39,323
You are straight-up
whiter than the whitest white man.

221
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:43,268
I thought there was a bit of black
under that tired blue suit you got on.

222
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,464
I see what time it is with you now.

223
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,303
Thanks for nothing, Mr. Tinsdale.

224
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,808
<i>Diedre on line one.</i>

225
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,612
Hi.

226
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,486
Waymon, how could you
cancel lunch today?

227
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,322
I had something very important
to talk to you about.

228
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:08,793
Don't you love me?

229
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:11,330
Diedre, please. Of course I do.

230
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,058
<i>I don't wanna fight with you now.</i>

231
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,396
<i>I had to take a very important client
to lunch.</i>

232
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,539
More important than me, I suppose?

233
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:21,164
<i>Well, yes. Today, I suppose he was.</i>

234
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:27,015
All right.
I'll just forget you ever said that.

235
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,547
It's not important.

236
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,208
I know how obsessive you can be
about work.

237
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,321
All is forgiven.

238
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:36,117
We'll talk about it tomorrow
on the squash court.

239
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,261
Don't be late. Ciao, sweetie.

240
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,124
- Good night, Mr. Tinsdale.
- Oh, good night, Donna.

241
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,072
I don't know
where you know Natalie from...

242
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,481
...but you might as well keep
your miniature-ass dick in your pants...

243
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,621
...because the girl's too fly for you.

244
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,313
Wait. You know this girl? Bobby.

245
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:11,189
Pfft. Pencil dick.

246
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,089
Weenie roast.

247
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:16,026
Pig in a blanket. Mini-squirt.

248
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,781
Hey, look at Mitchell over there.

249
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:40,615
- Yeah.
- I hear he lost his job. His firm folded.

250
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:44,623
Oh, man. Another real-estate broker
bites the dust.

251
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,488
- That could be one of us.
- Not me.

252
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,220
I have Porsche payments to make.

253
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:51,855
- I told you not to buy that car now.
- I already have a mother.

254
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,697
Anyway, as soon as Drake hands me
that partnership, I'm set.

255
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,133
- You?
- Mm-hm.

256
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:02,106
Be serious. Tinsdale is the man.
Everybody knows that.

257
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:05,212
Yeah, everybody is wrong.
Our token black is not gonna use...

258
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,939
...affirmative action to get my job.

259
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,107
Whoa. I thought you and Waymon
were buddies.

260
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,149
What does that have to do
with anything?

261
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,379
I would just think
you'd be happy for him.

262
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,750
Not as happy as I'd be for me.

263
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,417
- Hey, guys.
- Waymon.

264
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:22,120
- We were just talking about you.
- How you doing?

265
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:25,664
- What took so long? You're late.
- Work. What else? I'm still not done.

266
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,461
I'm just here taking a quick break.

267
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:30,264
Uh, club soda with lime, please.

268
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:32,066
You shouldn't work so hard, Waymon.

269
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,766
You should find a nice little honey,
have some fun.

270
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,605
- I have one.
- Who, Diedre? I thought that was over.

271
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,680
Yeah, well...

272
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,839
...we decided to give it another try.

273
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:44,653
She must be a champ
between the sheets.

274
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:58,759
Hang tough, Mitch. Wow.

275
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,131
You know, his mistake was buying
all of that property up in Harlem.

276
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:05,364
I tried to tell him that
gentrification shit was just a pipe dream.

277
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,601
I mean, even Waymon wouldn't
be caught dead in that wasteland.

278
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,142
Isn't that right, Waymon?

279
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:14,544
Hey, don't be stupid.
Waymon probably grew up there, right?

280
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,548
I don't think Waymon's
ever even been to Harlem.

281
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,382
You ever been to Harlem, Waymon?

282
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,614
You...

283
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,821
I gotta get back to work.

284
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:28,189
You guys take it easy.

285
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:29,352
See you.

286
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,306
What the hell are you doing here?

287
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:13,941
- Me?
- You.

288
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:16,509
I don't see
anyone else here stealing.

289
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,705
- What you talking about, stealing?
- I'm talking about these.

290
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,882
Don't you know I have to account
for every piece of paper...

291
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:30,889
...every envelope,
every damn paper clip in here?

292
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,495
It's my responsibility
to see that thieves like you...

293
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:37,860
...don't nickel-and-dime this place
out of business.

294
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,228
I wouldn't be bragging on no shit
if I were you.

295
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:43,838
Mother... What? That's it. You're fired.

296
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,769
You're finished. Get out.

297
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:47,841
What's going on in here?

298
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,972
Uh, nothing for you to concern
yourself with, Mr. Tinsdale.

299
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:55,145
Well, I am concerned.

300
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:59,452
I caught him red-handed,
stealing company property.

301
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:01,819
What property?

302
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:03,747
These.

303
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:09,156
- These are mine.
- Yours?

304
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,299
- What?
- They're mine.

305
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,058
Well, actually,
a client of mine's.

306
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,226
Bobby was doing me a favor,
weren't you?

307
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:19,835
Yeah, yeah. I thought you had
cleared that with Mr. Taylor.

308
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:22,806
Yeah, I don't appreciate that, man.
You almost got me fired.

309
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:26,277
I'm down here trying to do business for you.
You know what I'm saying?

310
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,006
You got me in a limbo.

311
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:29,912
You put my shit in jeopardy.

312
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,882
I said, I was sorry. Drop it.

313
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,545
I apologize, Monroe.
This won't happen again.

314
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:39,023
I am not taking the fall
for any shady goings-on.

315
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:41,694
Good night.

316
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:47,099
So, what brings you down here?
Slumming or what?

317
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,863
Bobby, this girl on the flyer,
you know her?

318
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:52,973
Yeah, I know her. So, what about it?

319
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,803
Well, she was in this restaurant,
I was having lunch...

320
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:59,141
...and she dropped this photograph.
And I'd like to return it.

321
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,414
This about Natalie?

322
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,551
This should be about the way
you dissed me.

323
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,381
Come on, Bobby,
I made a mistake in judgment, okay?

324
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:09,615
I'm sorry.
I was wrong not to at least listen.

325
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,952
Yeah, okay. But I'm gonna tell you now.

326
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,460
She ain't gonna be interested
in no square, blockheaded nigga like you.

327
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,996
Later.

328
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,488
Bobby.

329
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,635
Just tell me where to find her.

330
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,066
Yeah, keep dreaming.
Besides, what's in it for me?

331
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:25,069
- A promotion.
- I heard that before.

332
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,367
Not from a partner, you haven't.

333
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,009
Partner?

334
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,140
You introduce me to Natalie...

335
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:36,811
...and start dressing like
you're going to work and not to a party...

336
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,920
...and I'll put you
into the training program.

337
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,356
Deal?

338
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:46,292
Yeah, deal.

339
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,493
Yeah.

340
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,476
Shit. I'm late.

341
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,035
Concentrate.

342
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,968
I'm not playing anymore.

343
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,268
Not until I find out
what is going on here.

344
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:38,709
I'll tell you what's going on here.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

345
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,544
Waymon, you're throwing us
completely off schedule.

346
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,348
I was half an hour late. Shoot me.

347
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:49,012
Don't tempt me.

348
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:52,592
I'm not talking about today, stupid.
I'm talking about every day.

349
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:53,989
Stupid?

350
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:58,724
Waymon, if we don't start investing
some quality time into this relationship...

351
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,334
...I'm afraid everything's gonna go
out of whack.

352
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:02,936
What are you talking about?

353
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,697
Well.

354
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,062
Way...

355
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:10,835
...I was figuring
that if we're engaged by Christmas...

356
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:13,811
...then we can find the most perfect
condo in the winter...

357
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:16,712
...which is the best time to shop.

358
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,876
And then be married by summer.

359
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,385
Married by summer?

360
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,683
Oh, honey, it's the only possible time
for me to vacation.

361
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:27,158
Look, we've only been back together
for two weeks.

362
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:39,568
I mean, don't you think
that this is just a little premature?

363
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:42,674
I think you better
get with the program, mister...

364
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,778
...or lose the best woman you ever had.

365
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,881
Diedre, wait.

366
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:52,749
Diedre, wait.

367
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:54,946
Diedre.

368
00:22:56,491 --> 00:23:00,291
Well, Millicent, you go to bed
with dogs, you wake up with fleas.

369
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,293
And believe me, I am scratching.

370
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,557
Well, you cannot say
I didn't tell you so.

371
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,633
No, I guess I can't, Diedre.

372
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,327
I knew he was wrong for you
the first time I met him.

373
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,564
Oh, God. Sometimes I think
I'm just better off alone.

374
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,333
Karen, how can you say that?

375
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:16,977
Look at Waymon and me.
Our relationship is great.

376
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:19,375
When you choose a man
with your head...

377
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:21,948
...and not your heart,
you make a smarter choice.

378
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:24,608
So I may not be in love
with Waymon...

379
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:28,244
...but I know we make
a damn good team.

380
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:32,757
What about romance, passion,
sex till you can't stand up straight.

381
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:34,190
I need that.

382
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:36,489
You got that and where'd that get you?

383
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,157
A broken heart, a sore back,
a yeast infection.

384
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,167
And a stack of bills.

385
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,600
Speaking of sore backs.

386
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:46,764
I sure hope there's gonna be men
at this party.

387
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:49,274
Don't worry. Diedre has it covered.

388
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:52,436
Waymon is inviting some eligibles
from work.

389
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,343
Oh, God. I can imagine.

390
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,473
Excuse me?

391
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:58,414
Beggars can't be choosers.

392
00:23:58,587 --> 00:23:59,952
Check, please.

393
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,689
Darryl, did Johnson get back
from lunch yet?

394
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,400
You hear me talking to you, boy?

395
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:21,034
I'm working through lunch
if you don't mind.

396
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:24,807
Working through lunch?

397
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,076
Man, what you looking at?

398
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,414
You must be on something.
Or coming off it.

399
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:34,885
I ain't on nothing and you know it.

400
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,547
Oh, you're on something all right.

401
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,389
Must be some powerful shit too.

402
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:50,036
- What I tell you?
- You got it, man.

403
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:57,341
Yo, yo.
- Hey.

404
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,104
- Well?
- Well, what?

405
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:01,442
- Well, what? Natalie.
- Don't worry about it.

406
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:03,345
- You in there.
- In where?

407
00:25:03,518 --> 00:25:06,544
Forget about it. Meet me at
the Kilimanjaro tonight, midnight.

408
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,154
Midnight? Are you crazy?

409
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:10,848
I can't meet you at midnight.
I've gotta work tomorrow.

410
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:12,118
And so do you.

411
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:15,593
If you stay up past 9:00 one night,
it's not gonna kill you.

412
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,494
That may be true,
but I can't meet you tonight anyway.

413
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,636
- I've gotta meet Diedre.
- Man, you going out like that?

414
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:24,695
No, as a matter of fact,
we're staying in.

415
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,771
That's not what I meant, man.
Look, if you're there, you're there.

416
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,504
If you're not,
hey, I did my part, right?

417
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,669
Okay. Now, look...

418
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,807
Hey, Bobby. What's up?

419
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:38,043
- What's up, G-Man?
Gary...

420
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,017
...let's go.

421
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,930
What'd you wanna speak to me about?

422
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:57,071
I wanted to let you know
I think you're doing an excellent job.

423
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,831
Better than I could've hoped for.

424
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,565
Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Barnes.

425
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:03,006
But I wanna make sure
you go the distance.

426
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,167
The distance?

427
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:08,612
Let me be more specific.
Gary, my future is your future.

428
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,410
Where I go, you go.

429
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:15,818
When I am a partner in the most
powerful real-estate firm in New York...

430
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,390
...we're gonna own this town.

431
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,762
That is, if you're willing to do
what it takes.

432
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,899
Yeah. Yeah, I'm willing to do anything.

433
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:28,092
- I'm a team player.
- Good. Good.

434
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,828
I'm glad to hear that, Gary.

435
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:33,135
Driver, stop the car.

436
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,069
Gary.

437
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:38,007
Gary, get home safe, okay?

438
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,632
All right. Okay, a little to the left.

439
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,827
- A little to the left.
Sorry.

440
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:05,598
Oh, good. All right. Now, grab it.

441
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,639
Grab it. Harder.
Oh, good.

442
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,276
All right. Don't stop.

443
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,105
I said, don't stop.

444
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,180
Good. All right. I'm there. I'm there.

445
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,010
I'm there.

446
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:19,051
Oh! Yes!

447
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,246
Ahh. Ah.

448
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,828
Could you get off me, please?

449
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,363
- Ow. Careful.
- Sorry.

450
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,874
For the thing.

451
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:25,182
Excuse me.

452
00:28:25,353 --> 00:28:26,684
Excuse me.

453
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:29,722
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.

454
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,859
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

455
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:34,221
Excuse me. Good evening.

456
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,157
Good evening.

457
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,525
Hi, ladies. How are you?

458
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,963
Come on in.
Have a good time tonight.

459
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,864
How are you doing, man?

460
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,330
You can forget it.

461
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,903
- Bobby.
- Hey, hey. What's up?

462
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:51,909
- All right.
- How are you doing, big man?

463
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
- What's up? You ready for this?
- Come on in.

464
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,148
- I'm with him.
- Sure.

465
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,183
- Hey, Bobby?
- Oh, he's with me.

466
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:01,979
Sorry, man. Come on in.

467
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,319
Hey. Hey.

468
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:11,697
What was that guy's problem?

469
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:15,427
Hey, man, if you're in, you're in.
If you're not, you're not. Simple as that.

470
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:17,127
You're saying I'm not in?

471
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:19,899
Look, don't you own
any fly gear at all, man?

472
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:23,066
If you mean trendy clothes, no.
They're a waste of money.

473
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:26,680
Look, if you wanna get next to Natalie,
who is definitely high-level...

474
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,112
...you're gonna have to spend
some big bucks, man.

475
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,219
This happens to be
a Brooks Brothers suit.

476
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:34,651
Yeah. I suggest
you write that shit on the front.

477
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,451
Because it looks like
any old tired-ass gray suit to me.

478
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,388
What's up
with the Frankenstein shoes?

479
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,587
- That shows how much you know.
- Hey, hey.

480
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:44,959
That's all I'm trying to say.

481
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,270
- Look, where is she?
- Look, man, she's here, all right?

482
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,339
Try to have a little fun.
If you know how.

483
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,442
Well, maybe she's not here tonight.

484
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,942
I should go home
and get some work done.

485
00:29:58,112 --> 00:30:00,672
Look, the girl gives the parties here,
all right?

486
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,477
Her job is to be here.
She's gonna be here.

487
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:07,815
Why don't you just give that work shit
a rest, all right? And just chill.

488
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:22,067
Yo, what you need?

489
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,501
Yeah, yeah, give me
a Hennessey and Coke.

490
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,804
And for my boy...
Waymon, what you want?

491
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:32,209
Club soda, please, with lime.

492
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:34,914
Man, what's up
with the club soda?

493
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,019
It's late. I don't handle
hard liquor too well late at night.

494
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:41,917
That sounds like some shit
you need to keep to yourself.

495
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,285
You don't want people thinking
you're soft.

496
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,689
Yo. I see skin. I'll be back.

497
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,231
What? You see what?

498
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,257
- So, what's your name, baby?
- Davika.

499
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:22,328
- That's not your club name, huh?
- No. Do you have a club name?

500
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:25,864
No, I ain't got no club name.
My name is straight-up Bobby.

501
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,267
Would you like to dance?

502
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,861
Excuse me.

503
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,020
I'm sorry.

504
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:02,924
Excuse me. Excuse me. Please.

505
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:06,057
Excuse me. Excuse me.

506
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:21,309
You with the corny suit on.

507
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:25,384
Yeah. You just knocked over my drinks.
You gotta pay for it.

508
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,754
Mr. Tinsdale knew
you were coming by this morning.

509
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:03,516
I can't imagine what happened to him.

510
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:06,251
Let me check his office
for the financial projections.

511
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:09,157
You can look them over while you wait.
He'll be in shortly.

512
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,490
I certainly hope so.

513
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:12,855
Waymon?

514
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,728
Mr. Tinsdale.

515
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,429
- What time is it?
- Ten-fifteen.

516
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:22,201
You had at 10 a. m. with Mr. Atwell.

517
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,810
Oh, damn.

518
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,879
You what?

519
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:31,348
I called Mr. Kagawa and let them know
that they'll have it by Friday.

520
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,111
We should have discussed this.

521
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:36,723
I apologize. It just turned out to be
more work than I anticipated.

522
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:39,984
You do realize how important
this deal is to both of us?

523
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,221
- Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.
- You better be.

524
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:46,924
Uh, Mr. Atwell, sir? Mr. Atwell.

525
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:49,228
Mr. Atwell, please.

526
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:53,032
This is not a problem. Believe me
when I tell you that I am on top of this...

527
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:56,540
- I hope you haven't blown it.
- We'll speak later.

528
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,168
Damn.

529
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,318
Excuse me one second.
Hey, Waymon, wait up.

530
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,921
Waymon. Waymon, what's wrong?
You look awful.

531
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:13,390
I'm fine.

532
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:17,893
Come on, this is me you're talking to.
I know there's something wrong.

533
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,498
The Savoy Tower projections.

534
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:22,131
I just never thought it would be
this much work.

535
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:24,737
Well, why don't you let me help?

536
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:28,169
That's okay. I got it covered.

537
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,537
Hey, what are friends for?

538
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,144
Friends?

539
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:39,882
I gotta get back to work.
We'll talk about this later in private.

540
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,851
Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,354
Excuse me.

542
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:50,393
What's with you and him?

543
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:52,793
He's a racist bastard.

544
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:54,832
Is that what you came in here
to tell me?

545
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:58,597
If it is, I don't have time
to listen to your militant ravings right now.

546
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:01,333
Just chill, brother. And picture this:

547
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,706
Champagne, mellow music, you...

548
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:08,246
...and Natalie
making that love connection.

549
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,783
Oh, I can picture it.
When is it going to happen?

550
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,444
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

551
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:16,419
No, I can't make it tonight.

552
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,116
I gotta get some sleep.
I've got a deadline to meet.

553
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:22,660
I can't blow it. What about tomorrow?
Tomorrow works for me.

554
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:26,129
Man, this ain't no damn power lunch, man.
This is love.

555
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,268
You can't be
penciling that shit in, man.

556
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,698
Let me tell you something.

557
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:34,069
That ham is cooked, glazed
and ready to be sliced.

558
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:37,435
You just gotta go for it.

559
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,806
Okay. Okay.

560
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:42,141
I just can't stay out late.

561
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,612
Bet. But you can't go with me
looking like that tonight.

562
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,448
What is wrong with the way I dress?

563
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,789
Don't make me answer that.

564
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,017
But I tell you what,
meet me after work...

565
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:56,322
...I'll take you to the place.
I'll hook you up.

566
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,288
Yeah.

567
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:01,133
Bet.

568
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:24,822
No, no, no.

569
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,361
Forget it.

570
00:37:58,292 --> 00:37:59,782
All right.

571
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,190
- You got it.
- I got it?

572
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,331
- You got it.
- I got it.

573
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:11,571
Yo, I got it going on.

574
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:14,833
You know
what I'm saying to you, baby?

575
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:18,706
I'm kicking it a lot.

576
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,224
Oh, shit.

577
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:38,689
I called you a hundred times.
You didn't return any of my calls.

578
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:41,096
That's very unprofessional
of you, Waymon.

579
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:43,395
Look, honey, you've come
at a really bad time.

580
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,266
I was on my way out the door.

581
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,407
What is going on with you?

582
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,703
And I know
you are not seeing someone else.

583
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:54,211
What? No, no.
Of course not. Come on.

584
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:57,715
Now, look, I have a very important
meeting with my Japanese buyers.

585
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,614
- Dressed like that?
- What do you mean?

586
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:03,746
- Honey, I swear, you look like a jerk.
- Gee, thanks, hon.

587
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,584
I didn't mean that.

588
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,287
- So why don't I come with?
- You can't.

589
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:14,491
I mean, you know how these Japanese
are about women seen and not heard.

590
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:16,659
- Yes.
- Diedre, please. I'm running late.

591
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:19,032
You're always
talking about staying focused.

592
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,470
Making that almighty dollar
always comes first.

593
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:23,735
- Right.
- A condo...

594
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:26,903
...Benz, exotic vacations.

595
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,811
Now, how am I supposed to get
all of that for you?

596
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:34,182
I'll tell you how,
by working my tail off night and day.

597
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:37,290
That's how, right?

598
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,619
I guess you're right.

599
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,989
I knew you'd understand.

600
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:54,966
Hey, where are we going, anyway?

601
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,906
You the one who said
you wanted to chase the girl down, right?

602
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,309
So chill out and drive, man.

603
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,589
Are we in Harlem?

604
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:18,254
Yeah. So?

605
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,527
Nothing.

606
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:23,261
Don't tell me
you never been to Harlem before.

607
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:24,836
That's crazy retarded.

608
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:29,271
- You never been to Harlem before.
- Of course I've been uptown before.

609
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:33,205
I just didn't know we were
coming up here tonight, that's all.

610
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,128
What is this, one of those crack alleys?

611
00:40:56,303 --> 00:40:58,794
Crack alleys? Man, you tripping.

612
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,702
This doesn't look safe to me, Bobby.

613
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,843
Why don't you stop squawking
like a sucker?

614
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,568
Don't nobody want what you got.

615
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:09,312
Ow.

616
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,776
She came here
to meet some of her people.

617
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:40,277
There she is.

618
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:43,746
- Who are those guys?
- Those guys are large and in charge.

619
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,182
That's all you need to know.

620
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,717
Like I was saying,
we should make a move on 2-5 Street.

621
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:51,949
You're right.

622
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:54,526
People don't appreciate the value
of that location.

623
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:58,324
Yeah, brother. If we could
just bum-rush that entire situation.

624
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:01,161
Hey, fellas, how's it going?
- Hey, Johnson.

625
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,460
This is Waymon Tinsdale.

626
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:08,137
Hey, home dudes. What is going on?

627
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:13,903
Excuse us. We're busy.

628
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:15,981
Hey, hey, no problem.

629
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:23,946
Girl, he may be cute,
but he got too many ain't-gots.

630
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,083
- So, what you saying?
- I'm saying he ain't got no A-P-T.

631
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:29,286
Uh-huh.

632
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,296
- He ain't got no J-O-B.
- I heard that.

633
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,434
And he ain't got no C-A-R.

634
00:42:34,602 --> 00:42:37,093
You know, you can ride a dream
by yourself, girlfriend.

635
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,171
- Thank you.
- There it is.

636
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,830
Hi.

637
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,034
It's on the house.

638
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,403
Uh...

639
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:48,971
Thanks.

640
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:52,175
You all right?
You seem a little nervous.

641
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:57,415
Me, nervous?
Hey, no. I'm just chilling.

642
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,393
Is love this place. It's really, uh, def.

643
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,755
Right.

644
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:07,162
Well, enjoy yourself.

645
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:11,165
What's happening, troop?

646
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,397
What you drinking?

647
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:18,238
- Uh, club soda with lime.
- Club soda with lime, yeah.

648
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:22,178
Hey, bartender,
give us two shots of Black Label.

649
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,748
No, I...

650
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:29,580
Listen, Sherm, let me explain
something to you about women.

651
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:33,285
These young ladies in here...

652
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:39,456
...any man, even you,
can pull a serious fine honey out of here.

653
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:44,002
All you gotta do is remember
one golden rule, which is...

654
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,173
...the man with the gold, rules.

655
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:55,404
Hey, I'd love to,
but my jeep is in the shop.

656
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:58,642
Jeep? I thought you said
you had a Benz.

657
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:00,275
I said that?

658
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:03,981
- Yeah.
- I mean, my Benz, uh...

659
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,791
Hey, Bobby, man.
I've been looking all over for you.

660
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,862
- Johnnie Walker, Black.
- Man, what you been doing?

661
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:14,057
Hey, man. Hey, sharp as a tack.

662
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,269
Your ass is leery, man.

663
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:22,102
- You've been over there...
- Maybe you two could use a little drink.

664
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:23,573
Thanks, Nat.

665
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,373
You know, you're kind of cute.

666
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,749
You're in there.

667
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,146
- I'm in there.
- In there.

668
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,014
- Hey, I'm the man.
- You're the man.

669
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:36,088
Hey, man, I'm jamming on the...

670
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,247
Oh, shit.

671
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,761
How about a BMW, baby?

672
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,761
Know when to say when, boyfriend.

673
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:54,564
You're a valued member
of this firm, David.

674
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:57,267
Thank you.
- A real team player.

675
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,378
I try, sir.

676
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,711
You and Waymon Tinsdale are friends,
aren't you?

677
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:06,148
Yes. Why?
Is he in some sort of trouble?

678
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,117
Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.

679
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,416
It's just that he is focusing
on a very important deal these days...

680
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:13,492
...and hasn't much time
for anything else.

681
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,255
I've tried to warn him
not to put all his eggs in one basket.

682
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:19,422
What I wanna know is...

683
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,068
...can you take on
some of his smaller deals?

684
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:25,034
I want him to stay concentrated
on the Savoy Tower deal.

685
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:27,173
When he closes that one...

686
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:29,901
...it'll be a victory for the whole team.

687
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:32,508
- Of course.
- Ah!

688
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:37,348
- I knew I could count on you.
- Thank you.

689
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:41,949
To hell with that deal
and the damn team.

690
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:52,288
- Need some help?
- No.

691
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:58,263
Listen. I've been meaning to talk to you
about my status here at the club.

692
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:01,704
Since I took over promotions,
business has tripled.

693
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,274
I should be a partner.

694
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:08,638
- Jake.
- What?

695
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,849
You and I both know
I made this club hot.

696
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,283
Look. I don't have time for this
right now, okay?

697
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:16,980
Hopefully we can talk about it later on.

698
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:22,891
Natalie...

699
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,564
...these just came for you.

700
00:46:25,732 --> 00:46:27,996
Oh, thank you.

701
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:41,713
Finally.

702
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,579
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

703
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:48,482
Have you arranged for the messenger
for tomorrow morning?

704
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:49,644
Absolutely.

705
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:52,018
Don't forget to toss
these earlier projections.

706
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:53,591
The numbers are all wrong.

707
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,786
No problem. I'll take them down
to recycling right now.

708
00:46:56,964 --> 00:46:58,591
You've done enough for one day.

709
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:00,392
Take care of it tomorrow.

710
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,331
- Good night.
- Good night.

711
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:05,236
- Hi, Bobby.
- How're you doing?

712
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,498
- How's the head?
- Uh.

713
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:10,734
Terrible. But I haven't had time
to think about it.

714
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,811
I've been working
on the Savoy Tower deal.

715
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,380
The deal I almost blew
hanging out with you.

716
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:18,609
Tomorrow morning, the projections
will be delivered by messenger...

717
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:20,650
...at 7 a. m.
- Messenger?

718
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:24,120
Are you crazy? Those brothers are ill.
Give it to me, I'll take it.

719
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,191
They're not in right now, anyway.

720
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:30,228
And I don't wanna take the chance
that the hotel will lose it.

721
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:34,390
Besides, I feel more comfortable
with a professional messenger.

722
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,763
Man, now I'm insulted.

723
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,839
Tomorrow morning, the deal will be done.
You'll be my trainee.

724
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:42,942
Not because you helped me
meet Natalie...

725
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,044
...but because
you deserve the chance.

726
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:48,648
The least you could do is trust me
to make a run across town.

727
00:47:48,815 --> 00:47:50,612
With this in the hands
of a stranger...

728
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,811
...you won't be able to concentrate on
the real deal: getting busy with Natalie.

729
00:47:54,988 --> 00:47:57,115
Okay. I get your point.

730
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,987
- Seven a. m.
- I'll be there at 6:30.

731
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,128
Great. Now, where's my car?

732
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,287
- I left it at home.
- What?

733
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,159
Don't worry. It's safe, all right?

734
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,931
All right.

735
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:10,296
Look.

736
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:14,133
Meet me at this address
at 10:00.

737
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,139
Don't be late.

738
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:18,902
Tonight's the night.

739
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,445
Bet.

740
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:31,854
You know, we have sort of this open thing
happening now, you know?

741
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:35,392
And I really believe in giving a man
his space.

742
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:37,553
It can benefit everyone
in the relationship.

743
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:38,720
Now, don't you agree?

744
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:41,629
Well, I don't know.
I'm married, faithful and very happy.

745
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:45,203
Oh, congratulations. Excuse me.

746
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:49,064
Waymon. Waymon.

747
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:51,938
Hi, Waymon? Hey.

748
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:55,548
You remember...
You remember, uh, Susan. Susan.

749
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:57,013
Nice to meet you.

750
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,879
So how's the Atwell deal coming?

751
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,017
Great. Great.

752
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,746
What? What, it's done?

753
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:05,824
No. It will be tomorrow
when they receive the new projections.

754
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:09,895
Oh, I see. Oh, well, that's great.
That's great. Good luck, Waymon.

755
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:12,122
Thank you. Thank you.

756
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:14,529
Waymon. Honey.

757
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,499
Excuse me.

758
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:30,742
Hey, turn that down
or I'm calling the police.

759
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:35,619
- You talking to me?
- I don't see any other idiots out here.

760
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,821
Crazy bitch.

761
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:41,893
- Low-life.
- Baby, your weave's too tight.

762
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,301
Oh, shit.

763
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:52,302
With this recession and unemployment
reaching an all-time high...

764
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:55,066
...the job market is a merciless place.

765
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,732
- Isn't that right?
- Hm?

766
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,309
Uh, yes, absolutely.

767
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:00,070
The black youth have it the worst.

768
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,114
And it's a shame
that they just aren't prepared.

769
00:50:03,283 --> 00:50:06,116
I honestly think they don't know
what it takes to get ahead.

770
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:08,618
What exactly are you saying?

771
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,814
I'm saying that...

772
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:13,186
...carving your name
on the back of your head...

773
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,090
...is not exactly a career move.

774
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,094
Diedre, that's ridiculous.

775
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,359
I mean, one thing
has absolutely nothing to do with the other.

776
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:25,267
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Certainly.

777
00:50:26,473 --> 00:50:30,967
How dare you contradict me
in front of people.

778
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:34,011
I don't know what's going on with you,
but I don't like it.

779
00:50:34,181 --> 00:50:36,308
You know what's going on me?

780
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:38,644
I'm finally seeing the light.

781
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,652
Who do you think you are
that you can tell me what to think?

782
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:44,450
Or what to wear, what to do?

783
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,458
I need a companion. I need a friend.
Not an overseer.

784
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,529
I will not have this discussion here.

785
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,798
I'll call the police.
- You better stop fronting.

786
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,129
- I ain't after your fake-ass gold.
- Excuse me.

787
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,532
I'm here to see Waymon.

788
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:00,036
- Waymon?
Hey.

789
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:03,335
- What's up?
- What is this person doing here?

790
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,307
Person? You fake Whitney Houston-ass...

791
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,845
- You nappy-headed thing...
- All right. Hold it.

792
00:51:08,014 --> 00:51:10,380
This person happens to be
a friend of mine.

793
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,348
- His name is Bobby Johnson.
A friend of yours?

794
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,454
I'm not gonna take much more of this.

795
00:51:15,622 --> 00:51:17,385
This shit is whack. I'm out of here.

796
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:19,081
- Bobby, wait.
- Wait.

797
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:20,521
Hey, you coming?

798
00:51:20,694 --> 00:51:22,127
Coming where?

799
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:25,389
If you leave this party with that thug...

800
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:29,695
...it's over.
I never wanna see you again.

801
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:40,102
Okay.

802
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,941
Fine.

803
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:47,185
You son of a bitch!

804
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,288
You better get your black ass
out here.

805
00:51:49,456 --> 00:51:51,390
I'm counting to one, two...

806
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:03,394
Man, don't even sweat that, man.

807
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,197
She ain't all that.

808
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,935
She needs to take
some of that attorney money...

809
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:11,509
...and purchase some more ass.
That what she need to do.

810
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,474
Come on. You know the girl look like
a well-dressed number-two pencil, man.

811
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:20,778
Sex was probably weak too.

812
00:52:20,954 --> 00:52:23,320
She's like one of them
military-type bitches.

813
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,889
Military?

814
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,548
You know, military. You know:

815
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,353
<i>Left, right, left</i>

816
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:30,325
<i>In, out, in</i>

817
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:34,524
<i>Hump, half, hump, right
Hump, full, hump</i>

818
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:42,770
I'm right, right?

819
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:48,212
Just be there in half an hour.

820
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:52,283
Gary, I really don't care.
Just be there.

821
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:58,123
I'm sorry, everybody,
but the club's been closed.

822
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:01,886
- What?
- I'm as surprised as all of you are.

823
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:05,190
But you'll all get invitations
to my next event.

824
00:53:05,732 --> 00:53:07,927
I'm really sorry.

825
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:13,862
What's going on?

826
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,872
The club has been padlocked
by the damn IRS.

827
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:19,568
And that asshole Jake
didn't even tell me what was up.

828
00:53:19,746 --> 00:53:23,614
I invited all these people down here.
And now I look like a fool.

829
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,182
No, you don't.

830
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:28,612
More than that,
I don't even get paid for tonight.

831
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,949
I can just forget about my partnership.

832
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:35,126
I gotta get out of here.
Can you give me a ride?

833
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:43,994
Oh, yeah. Right. Right.

834
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,728
No problem.

835
00:53:45,906 --> 00:53:47,203
Why don't you go ahead?

836
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:49,604
I got some important things
to take care of tomorrow.

837
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:52,643
Yeah, we'll see you later.

838
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,970
See you.

839
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,047
My boy's in there.

840
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,816
Watch your legs.

841
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:18,263
Come on. Come on.

842
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,029
You're late.

843
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:22,197
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

844
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:24,172
Now, come on.

845
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,179
I'm so tired of everything always
blowing up in my face.

846
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:36,118
Nothing I do ever turns out
the way I plan it.

847
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:40,120
What is it exactly that you wanna do?

848
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:42,727
Well, for a long time, it was dancing.

849
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:44,454
But the auditions are murder.

850
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:48,829
And then when I finally do get a job,
the money barely pays the rent.

851
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:51,300
I just don't know anymore.

852
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:55,101
You know what
I've always dreamed of doing?

853
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:57,573
- Owning my own nightclub.
- Yeah?

854
00:54:57,744 --> 00:55:01,077
- Mm-hm.
- Well, don't give up on that one.

855
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:06,184
When I was in junior high school,
I wanted to join a band.

856
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:08,913
You know, be a rock star.

857
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:12,354
So I asked my parents
if I could take guitar lessons.

858
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:14,288
They said, "Absolutely not.

859
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:17,021
We're not going to spend
our hard-earned money...

860
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:19,927
...on some guitar lessons. "

861
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:22,260
So I tried to teach myself...

862
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:26,201
...and after a while,
I got discouraged and I stopped.

863
00:55:26,373 --> 00:55:28,500
Now, if I'd continued, who knows?

864
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:32,406
Might have been
Michael Jackson, Prince...

865
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,639
...Waymon Tinsdale III.

866
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:42,287
There's not a more beautiful view
in all the world.

867
00:55:50,163 --> 00:55:51,824
You are so beautiful.

868
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:56,032
Thank you.

869
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:37,764
Are we gonna get busted
for this?

870
00:57:37,937 --> 00:57:40,599
Not if you keep your mouth shut.

871
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,585
Bingo. Okay.

872
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:03,024
We're just gonna make a few changes
in these projections, okay?

873
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:04,754
Come on.

874
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:06,990
Do your thing.

875
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:12,095
- Come on.
- All right. All right. All right.

876
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:27,251
- We're in.
- Yeah.

877
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:56,173
What's up, Pep?

878
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,261
<i>Mr. Kagawa on line one.</i>

879
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,067
Good morning.

880
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:28,805
I trusted you and you blew it.

881
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,473
How could you have messed this up?
How? How?

882
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,245
- Get off me, man. You tripping.
- Yeah, I'm tripping.

883
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,183
What the hell's going on here?

884
00:59:36,356 --> 00:59:38,654
The Savoy Tower deal. Bobby blew it.

885
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,383
I showed him the package...

886
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,360
...but somehow he managed to get an
earlier draft with all the wrong numbers.

887
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,090
All I did is what you asked me to do.
That's all I did.

888
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:50,259
The Japanese took one look
at those figures, made a phone call...

889
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:52,404
...and closed a deal
with somebody else.

890
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:54,369
They're on a plane to Los Angeles.

891
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,873
I'm finished. And so are you.

892
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:04,106
Well, you heard the man. You're fired.

893
01:00:04,284 --> 01:00:07,253
Get your stuff and go.

894
01:00:18,398 --> 01:00:20,730
I'm very sorry, sir.
I don't know how this happened.

895
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,197
What do you mean?

896
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,269
You put a multimillion-dollar deal
in the hands of a mail boy.

897
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:27,235
That's how it happened. Waymon...

898
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:30,171
...this isn't the kind of error
a partner would make.

899
01:00:30,343 --> 01:00:32,208
Wait a minute. Sir, I can fix this.

900
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,836
- I just have to find a new buyer.
- We've lost the listing.

901
01:00:36,015 --> 01:00:38,074
Atwell intends
to take the bank's business...

902
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:39,718
...to another firm on Monday.

903
01:00:40,286 --> 01:00:42,618
Mr. Drake, I can do this.

904
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:44,913
I doubt it.

905
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:51,154
Well, what about Sunday?
We can do brunch.

906
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:54,630
Yeah, I see. Well, this deal is ready to go.

907
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:57,398
Sure. Sure.

908
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,038
Well, some of the best deals are done
on short notice.

909
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:03,604
Mr. Vance, excuse me. I'm sorry.
One second.

910
01:01:03,776 --> 01:01:07,234
<i>- Yeah, Sheila, what is it?
There's a Natalie here to see you.</i>

911
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,278
Send her in.

912
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:12,907
Sorry about that, Mr. Vance.
As I was saying, the... Hello?

913
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,247
- Hello, Mr. Vance?
Hi.

914
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:18,015
Mr. Vance. Damn.

915
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:21,055
Would you get me Vance
on the line again, please?

916
01:01:21,227 --> 01:01:23,354
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

917
01:01:23,629 --> 01:01:25,256
- Hi.
- Hi.

918
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,762
What is it?

919
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,094
You invited me to lunch, remember?

920
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:32,237
Damn. I've been so busy,
I totally forgot.

921
01:01:32,405 --> 01:01:34,305
I'm sorry, I can't go now.

922
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,875
No problem. You wanna meet later?

923
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:39,011
I don't think so.

924
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:40,577
What's the matter with you?

925
01:01:40,747 --> 01:01:43,875
This happens to be the worst day
of my life. That's the matter.

926
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:47,713
There's a whole lot of that going around.
Darryl just told me Bobby got fired.

927
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:50,651
Yeah, well, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll get over it.

928
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,520
I thought you two were friends.

929
01:01:53,693 --> 01:01:57,789
Hardly. If it hadn't been for him dragging
me all over the city chasing after you...

930
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,898
...none of this would have happened.

931
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,533
What's that supposed to mean?

932
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:04,035
Nothing. Nothing.

933
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:05,864
<i>I have Mr. Vance on the line.</i>

934
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:08,666
Uh, excuse me. I have to take this.

935
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:11,310
Take it and shove it.

936
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,968
I don't know what made me think
you were so different.

937
01:02:19,252 --> 01:02:20,378
Natalie.

938
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:23,215
Natalie. Natalie, wait. Natalie, please.

939
01:02:24,524 --> 01:02:26,515
Drop dead.

940
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:30,086
Natalie. Natalie.

941
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:44,743
- Waymon?
- What?

942
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:48,847
Don't snap at me.
Just calm down for a minute.

943
01:02:49,649 --> 01:02:52,277
I printed a copy of the final report.

944
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:55,182
This is completely different
than any of our drafts.

945
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,322
This wasn't a mix-up.

946
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:00,550
Someone or something
must have changed the projections.

947
01:03:00,726 --> 01:03:03,388
But whoever it was,
it wasn't Bobby.

948
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:25,348
Hi.

949
01:03:25,818 --> 01:03:27,376
Hey.

950
01:03:28,421 --> 01:03:30,321
Listen, I, uh...

951
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:33,291
I just wanted to say job well done.

952
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:35,256
Oh, thanks.

953
01:03:35,428 --> 01:03:38,522
You know, Bobby got fired.

954
01:03:38,865 --> 01:03:41,265
He was on his way out anyway.

955
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,867
Look, business is business.

956
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:45,663
Remember that.

957
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:48,803
Take this to Processing.

958
01:05:02,048 --> 01:05:03,481
Hey, the girl was dope.

959
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:06,515
You know what I'm saying?

960
01:05:06,686 --> 01:05:09,177
Ten-high. It's Sydney Poitier.

961
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:11,380
Guess who's coming to get high?

962
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,692
Hey, Bobby, can I talk to you?

963
01:05:15,861 --> 01:05:17,453
I can't hear you.

964
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:20,190
Ain't you heard?
He ain't got the booters no more.

965
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,995
- Please?
- We ain't got no crack neither, Sydney.

966
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,796
You're in the wrong spot for that.

967
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:27,337
Hey, look,
why don't you just back off, okay?

968
01:05:28,874 --> 01:05:30,341
You want a piece of me?

969
01:05:31,377 --> 01:05:33,277
- Come on.
- Better do something about that.

970
01:05:33,446 --> 01:05:37,143
- Let's do this.
- Man. Man, time-out.

971
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,447
Let's take a walk.

972
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:46,655
All right. So you came here to talk.
So talk.

973
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:52,520
I wanted to apologize
for what happened today.

974
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,258
I accused you of doing something
that you didn't do.

975
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:57,402
That you couldn't have done.

976
01:05:58,804 --> 01:06:00,601
I'm sorry.

977
01:06:02,475 --> 01:06:04,807
That's black folks' problem, man.

978
01:06:04,977 --> 01:06:07,445
Always passing judgment
on each other.

979
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:10,343
Putting our own brothers down,
and for what?

980
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,275
You're right.

981
01:06:14,086 --> 01:06:16,054
We're friends.

982
01:06:16,756 --> 01:06:19,281
Bobby, I should have trusted you.

983
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:27,795
People need to give each other
more credit, man.

984
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,765
Take a little more time
to understand each other.

985
01:06:30,936 --> 01:06:35,100
Look, Bobby, I'm probably gonna
offer the firm my resignation.

986
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:39,608
But I want you to know that before I go,
I'm gonna try to get your job back.

987
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:40,768
Quit?

988
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:43,908
No, man, you can't go out like that.

989
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,813
We need you in there,
help put some brothers down.

990
01:06:46,986 --> 01:06:52,083
Bobby, I've gotta find a buyer
willing to invest $ 75 million by Monday.

991
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,125
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

992
01:06:55,294 --> 01:06:57,159
You deserve that partnership, man.

993
01:06:57,863 --> 01:07:00,388
Look, I got an idea.
Am I still your trainee?

994
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:01,965
Hey, you know it.

995
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:05,103
It's, "You know that.
You know that. "

996
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,034
Whatever. What are you gonna do?

997
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:09,436
Get your high-powered
presentation together.

998
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:13,237
I'll check you on Monday.
I got some people I gotta see.

999
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,604
What are you gonna do?

1000
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:19,412
Just get out of Harlem
before you get your ass whipped.

1001
01:07:37,436 --> 01:07:39,666
Here you are.
Been looking all over for you.

1002
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,502
Now you know where to find me.
The late Frank Burke's office.

1003
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:46,511
- Did you have a good weekend?
- Pretty good.

1004
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:48,840
You wanna get some lunch? My treat.

1005
01:07:49,014 --> 01:07:52,575
Why not? You can take me to
the Ferry Bank Caf. I love that place.

1006
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:54,845
Are you crazy?
It's all the way in Brooklyn.

1007
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,681
Hey, you're going out
with the boss.

1008
01:07:56,856 --> 01:07:59,654
Lunch is over when I say
that lunch is over.

1009
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:02,421
Now you're talking.

1010
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:04,487
All right.

1011
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,158
He's having trouble with the financing
on this gold-company deal.

1012
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,769
It's not penciling out right.

1013
01:08:11,937 --> 01:08:15,065
I could get a better loan
from a guy named Vinny.

1014
01:08:19,211 --> 01:08:22,703
It's the Halloran brothers
to see Waymon Tinsdale.

1015
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:29,947
Sheila, the Halloran brothers
to see Mr. Tinsdale.

1016
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,392
Well, Bobby, here's your boy.

1017
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,562
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey. All right.

1018
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:44,703
Y'all remember my homeboy,
Waymon Tinsdale?

1019
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,394
How could I forget?

1020
01:08:46,572 --> 01:08:48,733
It's nice to see you again.

1021
01:08:49,275 --> 01:08:52,642
Leroy Halloran. These are my brothers
Roland and Theodore.

1022
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:54,712
The Halloran brothers?

1023
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,973
The ones that own
the Harlem National Bank?

1024
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:58,582
In the flesh.

1025
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:02,183
Oh, I didn't know.

1026
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:06,620
Man, you must have really thought
I was a jerk the first time we met.

1027
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:08,419
You could say that.

1028
01:09:08,594 --> 01:09:10,926
But thanks to Bobby,
we came anyway.

1029
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:13,963
- Hey, just doing my job.
- And a good job it is.

1030
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:17,330
Would you escort these gentlemen
to conference room B, please?

1031
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:18,834
Hey, no problem. Fellas?

1032
01:09:23,275 --> 01:09:26,244
Get Atwell on the phone.
No, send a limousine for him.

1033
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,678
Tell him I'm meeting with the Halloran
brothers of the Harlem National Bank.

1034
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,612
I present to you the Savoy Tower.

1035
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:40,190
Downtown Manhattan,
prime real estate.

1036
01:09:42,328 --> 01:09:44,592
One, we'll begin...

1037
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:54,965
And one of the most exciting features
is the pedestrian mall.

1038
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,802
it has 84 stories.

1039
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:04,147
Six million dollars.

1040
01:10:04,316 --> 01:10:08,047
Four-four-seven-zero
two-nine-four-seven-zero-three...

1041
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:17,252
- two thousand dollars per square foot,
offers a projected income...

1042
01:10:17,429 --> 01:10:20,398
...of a quarter of a billion dollars.

1043
01:10:20,566 --> 01:10:24,024
All right.
We're only a little apart on pricing.

1044
01:10:24,203 --> 01:10:27,866
You sweeten your deal by $2 million,
you got a deal.

1045
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,600
- Deal.
- Yeah.

1046
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,179
Hey, yeah.

1047
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:46,720
Waymon, what the hell
is going on here?

1048
01:10:46,892 --> 01:10:48,189
Mr. Drake.

1049
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,523
We were getting ready to call you
and invite you down to the celebration.

1050
01:10:51,697 --> 01:10:52,925
Celebration?

1051
01:10:53,098 --> 01:10:56,295
Yes. With the assistance
of Mr. Bobby Johnson...

1052
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:58,698
...the Savoy Tower has a buyer.

1053
01:10:59,305 --> 01:11:00,863
Oh?

1054
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,838
Mr. Drake, I'd like to introduce you
to the Halloran brothers...

1055
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,271
...of Harlem National Bank.

1056
01:11:05,444 --> 01:11:07,173
- What's up, homes?
- What's happening, Jack?

1057
01:11:08,914 --> 01:11:10,745
They've agreed to our terms.

1058
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:13,509
I see.

1059
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,717
Well, Mr. Johnson...

1060
01:11:18,057 --> 01:11:20,321
...where's my glass?

1061
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:27,724
- Thank you very much, sir.
It feels good, doesn't it?

1062
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:31,259
- Roland, thank you for coming by.
- Yes.

1063
01:11:31,437 --> 01:11:33,132
We look forward to seeing you.

1064
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:34,431
Anything I can do.

1065
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:37,006
Boy, that's the life, huh?

1066
01:11:38,944 --> 01:11:40,605
Are you just coming back
from lunch?

1067
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,944
- Yes, sir.
- I'll speak with you later.

1068
01:11:44,783 --> 01:11:46,808
Hey, what's going on here?

1069
01:11:46,986 --> 01:11:48,886
Only closing the Savoy Towers deal.

1070
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,751
What? Wait, what are you doing here?
You were fired.

1071
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:54,893
Well, he's rehired.

1072
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,260
I'm taking this up with the board, sir.

1073
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,398
And tell them what?

1074
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:05,398
All right, shut up and get out.
You're fired.

1075
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:07,768
You can't fire me, because I quit.

1076
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,407
This is getting good.

1077
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:13,807
Mr. Tinsdale, I changed the figures
on your report Thursday night.

1078
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:15,571
- You did what?
- What?

1079
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:18,009
I know...
David told me to do it.

1080
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:20,250
You damn liar.

1081
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,114
You watch yourself, Mr. Barnes.

1082
01:12:22,287 --> 01:12:23,948
I shouldn't have done it.
I'm sorry.

1083
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:26,250
I don't have to stay here
and listen to this.

1084
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:31,023
It says here,
"David Barnes, in, 12:30 a. m., out... "

1085
01:12:31,196 --> 01:12:33,323
Give me that, you stupid nig...

1086
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:38,800
God, dog.

1087
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:41,103
Way to go, Waymon.

1088
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:45,767
Mr. Tinsdale, I'll see you
in the office, partner.

1089
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,208
Yes, sir.

1090
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,415
- Thank you.
I didn't know he had it in him.

1091
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:52,516
Uh... Uh...

1092
01:12:52,684 --> 01:12:54,345
...Mr. Drake, if I could just...

1093
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,613
- Partner. I'm a partner.
- Partner. You did it.

1094
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,622
- All this time, man.
- That's what he said, man.

1095
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:03,626
- Tyson. You see that jab?
- Whoo!

1096
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,983
Who is it?
- Waymon.

1097
01:13:30,556 --> 01:13:32,217
What do you want?

1098
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:34,291
Uh... Well...

1099
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,819
...I came by because
I wanted to apologize for what happened.

1100
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:40,521
I'm really sorry.

1101
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:42,260
You should be.

1102
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:45,892
I never ever wanted to hurt you.
Natalie, I just want another chance.

1103
01:13:46,071 --> 01:13:47,732
I need you.

1104
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,937
I hope he brought his kneepads.

1105
01:13:52,811 --> 01:13:54,904
I'm on my knees. I'm begging.

1106
01:13:59,785 --> 01:14:02,185
Get up. Somebody might see you.

1107
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,447
I don't care who sees me.

1108
01:14:04,623 --> 01:14:05,954
Come on, get up.

1109
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,752
Not until you say yes.

1110
01:14:07,926 --> 01:14:09,894
Yes. Get up.

1111
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:21,133
What's up, man?
I thought we was going for a ride.

1112
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:28,969
Hey, I got something I want you to see.

1113
01:14:29,148 --> 01:14:30,809
Come on.

1114
01:14:31,783 --> 01:14:33,842
It's great. It's great.
You're gonna love it.

1115
01:14:34,019 --> 01:14:36,112
Yo, Bobby.
- Hey, Nat.

1116
01:14:36,288 --> 01:14:38,518
Man, you went out, man.

1117
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:41,352
I can't believe my boy went out
like that.

1118
01:14:57,643 --> 01:14:59,543
Oh, hardwood floors.
Yes.

1119
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,475
But it's bigger than hardwood floors.
This is really big.

1120
01:15:02,648 --> 01:15:04,809
You gotta get ready.
It's bigger than gigantic.

1121
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:07,850
Gigantic.
- This is the biggest thing. It is so big.

1122
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:13,356
- One, two, three, surprise!
- One, two, three, surprise!

1123
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,889
What do you think?

1124
01:15:17,663 --> 01:15:19,028
Well...

1125
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:21,359
...I think it's great.

1126
01:15:21,533 --> 01:15:23,558
- But what is it?
- What is it?

1127
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:26,829
It's what you've always wanted.
It's your own club.

1128
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,473
The Halloran brothers agreed to put up
all the money.

1129
01:15:29,641 --> 01:15:32,667
If you do the work,
they split the profits with you fifty-fifty.

1130
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:34,436
What do you say?

1131
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,471
I say yes.

1132
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:42,018
It's all in a day's work, babydoll.
Me and Waymon hooked it up.

1133
01:15:42,187 --> 01:15:44,155
It's a business-type thing,
you know?

1134
01:15:44,323 --> 01:15:47,656
Start getting busy on the business side,
ain't nothing we can't do.

1135
01:15:47,826 --> 01:15:49,054
Start getting busy.

1136
01:15:49,228 --> 01:15:50,889
Excuse...

1137
01:15:51,063 --> 01:15:53,327
Yo, I did some shit too.

1138
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:57,297
There you go. Okay.
That's what I'm talking about.

1139
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,699
- Hey.
- Man, come on.

1140
01:16:20,926 --> 01:16:23,087
Good night, Mr. Tinsdale.

1141
01:16:29,868 --> 01:16:33,201
Hey, man. You still working?
We're going to be late.

1142
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:35,237
Hey, business first, right?

1143
01:16:35,407 --> 01:16:37,398
I like the way you think.

1144
01:16:38,644 --> 01:16:41,169
- You ready for this?
- Hey, I was born ready.

1145
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:44,281
You were born ready. Is that right?
- Yeah.

1146
01:16:44,449 --> 01:16:46,917
Speaking of ready,
you seen Drake's new secretary?

1147
01:16:47,085 --> 01:16:49,781
I already closed that deal.
- Yeah, well, she told me.

1148
01:16:49,955 --> 01:16:53,482
- I think it's the suit.
- No, I think it's the paycheck.

1149
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:56,526
- Good night, Donna.
- Good night, Mr. Tinsdale. Mr. Johnson.

1150
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,287
See you.

1151
01:17:17,849 --> 01:17:19,373
Whoa! Are you ready for this?

1152
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,519
Ain't nothing to it,
but to do it, brother.

1153
01:17:21,687 --> 01:17:23,018
- Let's go.
- Time to party.

1154
01:17:23,188 --> 01:17:25,213
Hey, hey, what's happening, man?

1155
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:27,781
Okay.

1156
01:17:27,959 --> 01:17:29,654
- What's up, chill?
- My man.

1157
01:17:29,828 --> 01:17:34,322
Hey, how you living?
All right. All right.

1158
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:37,090
I see you.
Looking good.

1159
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,809
Now, don't forget. Don't forget.

1160
01:17:45,977 --> 01:17:48,571
Hey, my man. My man, my man.

1161
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,840
You know, we gotta talk.

1162
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:53,241
I'll be back.

1163
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:09,330
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

1164
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:12,368
- I'm glad you came.
- All right.

1165
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:19,266
- You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.

1166
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,810
You don't look too bad yourself.

1167
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,318
Excuse me.

1168
01:18:33,492 --> 01:18:35,653
- Excuse me.
- Pardon, please.

1169
01:18:35,927 --> 01:18:37,189
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

1170
01:18:37,362 --> 01:18:39,489
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

1171
01:18:39,664 --> 01:18:41,723
And what is so damn funny?
Let us in.

1172
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,993
- This ain't for you, all right?
- The nerve.

1173
01:18:44,169 --> 01:18:47,195
I demand to see somebody in charge.

1174
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:50,136
Oh, man, perfect timing.
These ladies wanna talk to you.

1175
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,742
Aha. Ah!

1176
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:55,379
If it isn't
Teenage Mutant Negro Chicken Legs.

1177
01:18:55,547 --> 01:18:58,516
- Taxi. Oh, excuse us.
- Excuse us.

1178
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:02,009
Damn, she could Hula-Hoop
with a damn Cheerio, couldn't she?

1179
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:05,414
That's right, get out of here. See you.
