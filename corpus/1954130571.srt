1
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:12,211
I can't remember how it started.

2
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:14,474
I remember feeling scared and lost

3
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:34,644
C'mon, kid.

4
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,454
So how'd it start?

5
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:14,011
Hey, how'd it start?

6
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:16,433
Small fires make big fires!

7
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,103
Small fires make big fires.

8
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:24,816
Well, I surely hope so.

9
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,538
What if we get caught?

10
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:21,428
We ain't gonna get caught.

11
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,485
Sorry.

12
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,069
And whatever they fought for,

13
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,410
that place became the United States.

14
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:50,083
Hey Walt.
That's a swell hat you got there.

15
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:51,591
Ain't you a movie star?

16
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:54,127
Yeah, where'd you get that hat?

17
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:59,731
Bowling alley's got burned up.

18
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:01,292
Fire get anyone?

19
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:02,328
No.

20
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,749
Well,

21
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,259
life ain't a goddamn movie.

22
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,320
Sometimes I wish I was in the movies.

23
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,141
Not to be famous or nothin'.

24
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:19,572
I just wish I was made of light.

25
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:22,411
I'd be a light up there
on the silver screen.

26
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,492
Not at all a little kid anymore.

27
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,480
Hey!

28
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,016
Havin' a fun birthday?

29
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,486
What's it to you?

30
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,511
I can help you have fun, is what.

31
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,111
Can I help you?

32
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:18,394
You got
one of the Shirley Temple photos?

33
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:23,437
Well, we ought to, I think.

34
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:26,177
Star photos are half a dollar.

35
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,672
You're a nickel short.

36
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,197
Aw, come on.
It's my birthday.

37
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:39,433
I'm turning eleven.

38
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,164
Say, how'd you get in here?

39
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,904
Lester let you in the back?

40
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:46,938
Lester!

41
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:53,294
You are in big trouble, young man.
- Come on!

42
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:55,440
I didn't do anything!
Let me go!

43
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:02,918
Hey, can I have a lift?

44
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:04,286
Fuck you.

45
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,981
I didn't do nothin'!
- Fuck you, you little queer.

46
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,867
Hey, take that back!

47
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,139
Fuck you.

48
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:32,403
Wow.

49
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,015
Look at this place.

50
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:35,853
Wow. Look at this.

51
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,096
Wow.

52
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:16,962
You know that girl from Selma?

53
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,640
Yeah, the one
that's gonna be in the movies?

54
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:19,974
She's up at the city.

55
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:21,986
She's singing
at that pageant today, ain't she?

56
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,039
We ain't
goin' to no goddamn pageant.

57
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,600
Ah, hell, no.

58
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:27,437
We goin' to Selma.

59
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:29,923
Huh?

60
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,393
We are movin' fast now

61
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:38,799
and goin' further than I'd ever been.

62
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,114
It was like
we were at the center of the world,

63
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:43,480
headed towards Selma,

64
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,655
a land richer than I'd ever seen.

65
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:50,231
Lonnie used to say
there's two different worlds.

66
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:53,347
One's got everything,
and one's got nothing.

67
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:57,480
But truth is,
maybe they ain't so different after all.

68
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:00,707
Maybe life is filled
with all types of different worlds,

69
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,170
worlds of tough and weak,
pretty and ugly.

70
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:05,429
Sometimes I think
the only thing holding us together

71
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,185
is the sparks causing fires

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,755
or maybe electric lines

73
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,320
or the stars up above.

74
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,776
That it was all over,

75
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:18,535
and when I breathed,
my breath was like lightning.

76
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,857
Truth is,
I didn't care where we was headin'

77
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,991
as long as I
was gettin' out of this place.

78
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,367
Hey, Lonnie.
When we goin' out west?

79
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,808
Hell if I know, kid.

80
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,804
You said one of these times

81
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,219
we'd hop a freight
and get on outta here.

82
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,480
Well,

83
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,855
you ever hear about
the animal that chews off

84
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:56,124
its own leg
to get free from a trap?

85
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,978
That's what it's like
tryin' to leave this place.

86
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,465
I ain't gonna live in no trap.

87
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,406
I'm gonna be gone.

88
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,700
Well,

89
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,594
you can't run
with but one leg, kid.

90
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,521
Selma.

91
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:42,855
It was like a scene from the movies.

92
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:49,587
We're off to see the wizard,

93
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,343
the wonderful wizard of Oz.

94
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:57,634
Wow.

95
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:07,146
Come on.

96
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,300
It's yours, kid, for your birthday.

97
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:17,796
What you gonna call it?

98
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:19,328
Call what?

99
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:20,554
Your town.

100
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:22,700
Ain't nobody here but us.

101
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,132
Where they at?

102
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,703
They're up in the city.

103
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,886
That girl must sing like an angel.

104
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:29,682
Hep sings better than her.

105
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,289
Hep's singing will make you weep.

106
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,575
Oh, sure.

107
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,191
What the hell
do you know about anything?

108
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,567
I know that girl's going
to California to be in the movies,

109
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:40,904
and you and Hep ain't
never gonna leave that fright yard,

110
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:44,409
ain't never gonna be nothin'.
- I ain't no girl.

111
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,035
Ain't no Selma.
No city.

112
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:47,371
No nothin'.

113
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,121
He's the only one
in this whole goddamn world.

114
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,381
It's your world, brother.

115
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,120
Now what you gonna call it?

116
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:03,607
Fort Apache.
Let's call it Fort Apache.

117
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,739
What are you doin'?

118
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,945
I need a bridesmaid.

119
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,476
Shirley Temple.

120
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,532
Hollywood special.

121
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:19,387
Sometimes I wish I was a little kid again

122
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,887
and didn't have
to think about none of it.

123
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:27,886
But something
inside of me had changed

124
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,191
and I knew
I couldn't never go back.

125
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:35,828
Walt!

126
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:14,478
I realized
I didn't want to be like Lonnie,

127
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,539
and I knew
my destiny now lay with Hep.

128
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:21,177
Wanna ring the bell?

129
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,507
Ain't it like a movie?

130
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:51,519
You ever think that

131
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:55,234
ain't nobody in the world
that could understand you?

132
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,430
I think I'm crazy.

133
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,885
I really must be.

134
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:00,726
[Walt:]
I'm leavin' one day.

135
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:02,676
You could come with if you want.

136
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:04,822
We could look out for each other.

137
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,822
Stay or go, it's all the same.

138
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:09,838
Burn a thousand bowling alleys.

139
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,489
Burn the whole goddamn world.
It doesn't matter.

140
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,327
Walt!

141
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,625
Walt, come on. We gotta go!

142
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,550
Hep, we still gonna ring the bell?

143
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:33,047
Hep, come on. We gotta go!
- Come on, Walt!

144
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:33,960
We gonna ring it?

145
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,265
Here come the police!
- We gotta go!

146
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,510
Walt! Hep! Come on!
- Come on!

147
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,471
There was no way out.

148
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,227
No one to call to for help.

149
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,348
I felt like if I could just hit that bell

150
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,249
hard enough

151
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:51,172
then maybe
someone would finally hear us.

152
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:43,401
The End

153
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,893
