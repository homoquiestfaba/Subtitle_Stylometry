1
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:06,678
(eerie electronic piano music)

2
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:31,706
(metal clanking)

3
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:45,936
(scanner beeps)

4
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:17,493
(man calls in foreign language)

5
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:27,472
- Don't move.

6
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:36,737
(metal creaking)

7
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:51,845
Well that leg looks pretty bad.

8
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,187
(tense music)

9
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:07,650
I gotta go.

10
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,757
(peaceful music)

11
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,745
- Wade, what are you doing?

12
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,212
Where's Mandroid?

13
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:44,795
- Mandroid is here.

14
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:54,548
- Well this is certainly
keeping out of sight.

15
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:56,793
- Zanna, I just saved some guy's life.

16
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,997
- Wade, if a security patrol
came along and saw you--

17
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:01,494
- Security patrol can't
do a damn thing to us.

18
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:04,941
- Except throw us in prison,
execute us for no reason,

19
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:05,774
torture us.

20
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:06,607
- All right.

21
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,142
Fine.

22
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:08,975
- Hey.

23
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,746
Hey.

24
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:15,412
I'd rather have you alive than dead.

25
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,329
That's all.

26
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:25,841
(adventurous orchestral music)

27
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,194
(laughs)

28
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:33,699
- Tell me, tell me, Carolyn.

29
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,162
- Why?

30
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:36,602
Are you interested?

31
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,359
- Just curious.

32
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,806
- Curiosity killed the cat. (laughs)

33
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:42,411
- Okay.

34
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:43,578
Don't tell me.

35
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,507
(sneaky music)

36
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,868
- You know what to do.

37
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:20,901
- (grunts) Yes.

38
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,734
- Hurry!

39
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:32,486
- He used the old line about
being an American lost here

40
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:35,408
and would I show him the city.

41
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:36,844
- Did you?

42
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:37,677
- Sure.

43
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,528
Just enough.

44
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:41,361
- And?

45
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,418
- And what?

46
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:46,529
- Did you fall in love with him?

47
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,721
- Right now, I'd drop to the floor

48
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:51,201
for any man who would take me
who would take me to the US.

49
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,679
- Any man?

50
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,613
- Yes.

51
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,770
(Alexa laughs)

52
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,971
Any old pig would do it. (laughs)

53
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:00,554
(man grunting)

54
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,275
(men chuckling)

55
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:27,212
(car engine running)

56
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:28,045
- Ah!

57
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,628
Let's push it down!

58
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,818
(men grunt and groan)

59
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:34,929
(car screeches)

60
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,512
(women scream)

61
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,952
(screaming)

62
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:52,535
(men taunting)

63
00:07:55,503 --> 00:07:57,836
(screaming)

64
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:14,185
(door creaks)

65
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,768
(creepy music)

66
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,860
- Please.

67
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,027
Don't hurt me.

68
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,621
- I will not hurt you.

69
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,033
I just...

70
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,173
want you to be nice to me.

71
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,733
I want you to dance for me.

72
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:32,467
- Hm.

73
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,140
(chuckles)

74
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,504
Looks like somebody's been
stockpiling young women.

75
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:40,599
Ooh la la.

76
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,403
- You think that's funny?

77
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:44,533
- Hey, take it easy, alright?

78
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,931
- Those girls might be dead right now.

79
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,764
- Wade, it was a joke.

80
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,267
- Just do your job.

81
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,054
Let's get Mandroid fired up.

82
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:55,691
- Don't be angry at Ryder.

83
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,665
We're all under a lot of pressure.

84
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,706
Ben gets out of the hospital tomorrow

85
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:02,675
and we're running out of time.

86
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,365
- You got all the time
in the world with me.

87
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:05,405
I'm not going anywhere.

88
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,867
- Well, I didn't say that.

89
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:09,209
- Oh, what the hell.

90
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,397
I'm either in the chair or in the tin can.

91
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:14,064
Let's get this show on the road.

92
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,469
(beeps)

93
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,877
(dark music)

94
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,817
- Ready to rock and roll?

95
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:38,567
- [Mandroid] Captain
Radiation strikes again.

96
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,481
- Time, Zanna?

97
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:00,564
- 10 seconds.

98
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:04,379
Record it all.

99
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,373
(electric buzzing)

100
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,754
(explosion)

101
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:44,308
- [Wade] Zanna, turn off the unit.

102
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,975
(alarm beeping)

103
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,437
- Don't panic.

104
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
Cut the power manually, Wade.

105
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,072
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?

106
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,885
- Break the cone, if we
hit the red we're gonna fry

107
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:16,135
half the country with this.

108
00:12:58,426 --> 00:12:59,259
- [Wade] We might want to run a check

109
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:01,676
on Mandroid's delicate touch.

110
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:36,895
(mysterious music)

111
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:52,298
(snoring)

112
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,369
- My God.

113
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:37,068
- [Zanna] Yuck.

114
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:38,318
Some leftovers.

115
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:42,633
- Here, catch.

116
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:46,251
You start on the salad,
I'll improvise the rest.

117
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:49,406
- Ooh, I didn't know you were a chef too.

118
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:51,489
- Just an asshole, right?

119
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:58,355
- You know, I have this stupid idea that

120
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,487
one day I'm gonna pump the Supercon in me

121
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:03,757
and I'm gonna stand up and walk
away from this chair and...

122
00:15:03,757 --> 00:15:05,757
(sighs)

123
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,893
I'm trying, Zanna.

124
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:15,991
- I know.

125
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:24,934
Am I too heavy?

126
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:28,023
- I couldn't even feel
it even if you were.

127
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:28,856
- Well.

128
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,408
- I can feel that.

129
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,246
- That's good.

130
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:45,802
(thunder crashes)

131
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,831
(dramatic music)

132
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,149
(groans)

133
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:34,859
(rain falling)
(thunder crashing)

134
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:53,974
(door creaks open)

135
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,341
- You'll look good in this.

136
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:04,927
(giggling)

137
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:28,145
- Now Philip, drink this.

138
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:33,907
Don't you want these scars to disappear?

139
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:35,907
I can make them go away.

140
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:40,926
Now, drink this.

141
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,417
Please.

142
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,250
Now!

143
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:55,307
New tissue should grow almost immediately.

144
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:59,367
(groaning)

145
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:11,410
(chuckles)

146
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,160
Take him with the other failures.

147
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:33,114
(door creaks open)

148
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,524
(gasping)

149
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:41,075
(men jeering)

150
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:47,937
- Do whatever he says, whatever it is.

151
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,283
- What?
- [Prisoner] Do it!

152
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:51,169
- Or he'll give you to
those crazy bastards.

153
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,002
- What crazy bastards?

154
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:56,596
(spits)

155
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,518
(frantic music)

156
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:03,768
(cheering)

157
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,798
(yells)

158
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:32,303
- And what are you going
to do for us tonight?

159
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,053
- I don't understand.

160
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:36,923
- Dance for us.

161
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:42,463
- Bam bam.

162
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:44,390
Bam bam.
(claps)

163
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,223
Bam bam.

164
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,565
Bam bam.

165
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:49,173
Bam bam.

166
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:50,231
Bam bam.

167
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:52,798
(exotic music)

168
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,381
(men clapping)

169
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:35,687
- She's all yours, boys.

170
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:39,270
(men groaning)

171
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:51,910
(screaming)

172
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:16,477
- Oh Ben, this is our
new assistant, Ryder.

173
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:19,255
- Mr. Knight, this is quite an honor.

174
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,276
- Don't be too sure about that.

175
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,609
I've got quirks.

176
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:25,839
- Excuse me?

177
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,382
- Zanna didn't tell you.

178
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:28,465
- Never mind.

179
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:31,196
Let's go.

180
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,597
(mysterious music)

181
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,530
(computers beeping)

182
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,658
- Hey Ben.

183
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:52,641
Is that you under there?

184
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:56,364
- Glad to see you haven't
lost your sense of humor.

185
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,458
- Gotta have it.

186
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,782
- It's good to be home.

187
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:02,401
- It's very good to have you.

188
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,568
Come on, guys.

189
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,523
(Ben chuckles)

190
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:30,438
What's so funny?

191
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:33,393
- I don't want to take my bandages off.

192
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:35,910
You know, I have thought about
getting undressed with you

193
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,293
I don't know how many times
but I ain't doing it now.

194
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:42,375
- (laughs) Well, why not?

195
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,958
- Can't be modesty.

196
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,784
- Well, I don't want to not see myself.

197
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:50,784
If you know what I mean.

198
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:55,673
Jesus, my eyes!

199
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,356
- That's because there's nothing to stop

200
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,814
the light reflection on the eyes' surface.

201
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:03,532
Your optics nerves are completely exposed.

202
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:04,949
- Good diagnosis.

203
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,581
- Hold still.

204
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:10,498
- [Ben] Ow.

205
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:13,787
- Next time I tell you to wear your shades

206
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:16,467
maybe you'll pay attention.

207
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,511
- How long before this stuff takes effect?

208
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:21,339
- Well, Dad's last notes indicate between

209
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:23,288
two and three hours.

210
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,634
- So, what do we do until
my guest appearance?

211
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,518
- I'd like to get to work.

212
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:31,297
- Ryder, do you have everything?

213
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:32,677
- Yes I do.

214
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:33,922
Right here.

215
00:25:33,922 --> 00:25:34,755
- Oh, great.

216
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:36,922
Now I'm getting emphysema.

217
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,857
- The hardest thing for
you to get used to is your

218
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:42,499
hand-eye coordination.

219
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,018
That's completely changed now
because you can't see them.

220
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:47,810
You'll have to learn to
do the simplest things

221
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,006
all over again.

222
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,006
- Not if the drug works.

223
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:56,084
- Ben, this is just the
beginning of the experimentation.

224
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:57,913
There are no guarantees.

225
00:25:57,913 --> 00:26:00,329
- Well, I've got my fingers crossed.

226
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:01,585
I mean, who would want to be this way

227
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,241
even for five seconds?

228
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:05,755
- You know Ben, this invisibility thing

229
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,429
does have it its pluses.

230
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,036
You can skip out on checks in restaurants,

231
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:12,467
you can check out the
ladies room at the gym.

232
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:15,190
I mean, the possibility are endless.

233
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,833
- Ben, if you can light this cigarette,

234
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,166
you are my hero.

235
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,799
- [Ryder] That's incredible. (chuckles)

236
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:45,999
- Doctor Knox,

237
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,162
you must think I'm a fool.

238
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:51,602
- [Knox] Of course not, sir.

239
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:55,351
- To come to me with this strange
story about invisible men.

240
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:58,488
You have seen too much
American television.

241
00:26:58,488 --> 00:26:59,839
- Aren't you the least bit interested

242
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,256
in how your predecessor died?

243
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:07,098
A CIA agent was killed with him, you know.

244
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:10,180
- Goodbye, doctor.

245
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,638
- There is many involved here.

246
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:13,471
And power.

247
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,016
I can help you, sir.

248
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:23,019
If you have the knowledge,
you have the power.

249
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:25,534
- Goodbye.

250
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:43,148
- Virginia,

251
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:46,970
bring me the files on Colonel Kolczech

252
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,637
and Dr. Karl Zimmer.

253
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:55,402
(thuds)
(breathing heavily)

254
00:28:01,617 --> 00:28:02,867
- Hold it, Ben.

255
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:05,839
Let's see.

256
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,101
Okay.

257
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,753
This is steady.

258
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:15,582
What was his last pressure reading?

259
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:17,082
- Uh, 160 over 40.

260
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,257
- A regular see through
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

261
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:22,941
- Yeah, well Arnold, you
better relax for a minute.

262
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:24,428
I am not sure how all this exercise

263
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:27,428
is effecting the Supercon treatment.

264
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:32,407
(yelling)
Ben?

265
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:33,960
Come on, you have to talk
to me, you have to tell me.

266
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,186
Ryder, I'm gonna need some help here.

267
00:28:36,186 --> 00:28:37,519
Ryder, hold him!

268
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:46,906
- Hurry!

269
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:53,152
(yelling)

270
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:57,979
- Forget it, Zanna, you'll
need a sledgehammer.

271
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:05,382
- I'll cut you in half
you metal son of a bitch!

272
00:29:05,382 --> 00:29:07,549
(dinking)

273
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:13,140
- Come on!

274
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:15,969
- Stay still.

275
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:17,719
Keep him down, Ryder.

276
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:21,678
(groaning)

277
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:41,631
- I guess I lost it, huh?

278
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:45,714
- (chuckles) You could say that.

279
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,990
- Metal son of a bitch.

280
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,823
- Hey watch out, you know,

281
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:52,777
I could bring him in here anytime.

282
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:53,610
Ooh.

283
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:57,745
- Wade.

284
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,768
How do you deal with it?

285
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:02,601
- Usually?

286
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:05,585
Not very well.

287
00:30:09,964 --> 00:30:13,881
- Looks like we both have
a lot to get used to.

288
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:22,137
(grunts)

289
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,949
(glass shatters)

290
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:47,175
(screaming)

291
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:28,985
- If we don't get lucky soon

292
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:32,247
we may never be able to
reverse Ben's condition.

293
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:33,514
- Oh.

294
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:36,984
I'm off to the Supercon
chamber again, huh?

295
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:39,186
- What's on the schedule?

296
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,786
- Wade and I have a little work to do.

297
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:44,153
- Then you don't need me tonight, right?

298
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,260
I'll see you in the morning.

299
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,427
- Right, you're the hook again, Ryder.

300
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:52,786
- Come on, Wade.

301
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,549
- I'm sorry Zanna, that guy
bugs me plain and simple.

302
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,813
- He does good work.

303
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:01,813
- He's not the only one.

304
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,794
- What's this?

305
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:07,627
- Well...

306
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:15,187
(metal stomping)

307
00:32:21,158 --> 00:32:22,649
- This is incredible.

308
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,274
Wade, when did you do this?

309
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,307
- I've been working on it for a while.

310
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:27,196
The old helmet made me feel

311
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,746
like I was playing for the 49ers.

312
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,246
Now I'll look like

313
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:34,143
Elvis, the Vegas period.

314
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,514
(Zanna laughs)

315
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:41,597
- Hm, well, I've seen a better Elvis.

316
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:44,705
But Wade,

317
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,822
this technology is fantastic.

318
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:51,075
- Thank you.

319
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:59,449
(dramatic music)

320
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,514
- The kid, he's here.

321
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:21,681
- I'm waiting.

322
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:32,702
Come in, my boy, come in.

323
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:44,880
- Benjamin Knight's come back.

324
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,547
- In what condition?

325
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:50,737
- Zanna hasn't found the
formula for a cure yet

326
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,350
and the one that she
tried had side effects.

327
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,389
After an injection he
had some kind of a...

328
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:57,556
psychotic fit.

329
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:02,239
(laughs)

330
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:08,829
- The Zimmer medical talent
is up to its usual standards.

331
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:14,181
The fits can be controlled,
you know, with drugs.

332
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:18,108
You concentrate on the Supercon.

333
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:20,625
And be sure to get the
special set of specs

334
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,464
that Zimmer had always hidden away.

335
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:25,714
That's priority number one.

336
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:32,326
- If I do this for you,
you'll release my father?

337
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:33,781
- I will.

338
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,531
- I need a guarantee.

339
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:38,105
- I guarantee

340
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,737
he will never leave if I
don't get the Supercon spec.

341
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,720
(laughing)

342
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:02,842
- [Ryder] Dad.

343
00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:06,990
(laughs)

344
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,643
- I love family reunions.

345
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:13,755
Move your body.

346
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:25,442
- [Ben] Is this absolutely necessary?

347
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:27,942
- It's just a precaution, Ben.

348
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,141
I have to give you a
bigger dosage this time.

349
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:33,743
- Not that it wasn't fun last time, Ben,

350
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:36,603
watching you tear apart the lab.

351
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:39,058
Ooh, Zanna's gonna give
you the big needle.

352
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,391
(Ben gasps)

353
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,434
- Sorry Ben.

354
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:53,364
So, how are you feeling now?

355
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:55,307
- Okay.

356
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:58,885
What's happening?

357
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:04,481
Get me a mirror.

358
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,767
Boy, do I need a shave.

359
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:20,704
- To Zanna Zimmer.

360
00:36:20,704 --> 00:36:24,371
If your father were
here he'd be very proud.

361
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:28,281
- I had help.

362
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:32,497
- This is permanent.

363
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:33,330
- What?

364
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:35,503
- Me.

365
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:36,670
Being visible.

366
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,909
- I'm sorry Ben.

367
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:41,174
The radiation you were exposed to

368
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:42,680
absolutely mutated your body,

369
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,346
to stay visible you will
have to stay on this drug.

370
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:48,473
I'll figure the dosage
and the frequency next.

371
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,311
- For the rest of my life?

372
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:52,228
- Probably.

373
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:54,914
- Can I control this thing?

374
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:57,428
- As it is now, if you
touch a Supercon crystal

375
00:36:57,428 --> 00:37:00,171
you will become invisible so.

376
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:02,100
- Speaking of invisible,

377
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,712
where's the perfect little assistant?

378
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:07,212
(tense music)

379
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:40,402
Hey.

380
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:44,917
Zanna doesn't pay overtime.

381
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:45,750
- Oh, ha.

382
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,853
There were a few things
that needed cleaning, so.

383
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:54,571
- You've already the efficiency award.

384
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:55,654
Take a break.

385
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:01,049
What's wrong?

386
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,251
Hey, you don't look so hot.

387
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:05,084
- Uh...

388
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:10,412
I think I'm just gonna go
home and get some sleep.

389
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:17,845
- Ryder.

390
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:21,399
You need something?

391
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:23,822
- No.

392
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:25,550
No, I'll be fine.

393
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,520
I'll see you in the morning.

394
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,853
Congratulations, by the way.

395
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:41,921
(tires screeching)

396
00:39:04,902 --> 00:39:06,853
(truck horn blares)

397
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:08,853
(yells)

398
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:19,253
(tense music)
(engine hissing)

399
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,407
(explosion)

400
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,840
(gargling)

401
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:56,797
- I hope you'll be able
to identify Mr. Ryder.

402
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:58,472
- [Zanna] Is it that bad?

403
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:00,976
- It's most unusual, doctor.

404
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:02,059
Most unusual.

405
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:07,394
Let them see the corpse.

406
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:27,674
- That's him.

407
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,174
- And you're sure?

408
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:34,505
There isn't much of him left.

409
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:37,343
- I'm sure.

410
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:40,627
- This is the most remarkable thing.

411
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:44,144
The state physician has
no idea how this condition

412
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:46,488
could have occurred.

413
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:51,106
One of my lieutenants thinks
this is a sign from God.

414
00:40:51,106 --> 00:40:53,523
Mr. Ryder worked in your lab.

415
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:58,319
How do you think this could have happened?

416
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,569
- I don't know.

417
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:06,329
- Then consider yourself under
arrest for not cooperating.

418
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:29,384
- [Ben] Jesus, this bench is cold.

419
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:30,444
- Ben?

420
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:31,277
Ben?

421
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:34,203
- Who are you talking to?

422
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:36,068
- Uh, no one.

423
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:38,814
No one. (chuckles)

424
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:40,712
Where are you?

425
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:44,437
- [Ben] I'm about a foot to the right.

426
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,643
- How did you get here?

427
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:48,872
- [Ben] I hitched a ride with you guys.

428
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:52,026
I'm getting you the hell outta here.

429
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:55,359
- (chuckles) Crazy one.

430
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,214
- Is this the man you talked about?

431
00:42:08,214 --> 00:42:10,573
- No, this one helped
pick up Benjamin Knight

432
00:42:10,573 --> 00:42:11,635
at the hospital.

433
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:14,214
He worked for Zimmer.

434
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:15,671
Has she talked yet?

435
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:16,838
- No, not yet.

436
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:20,219
But I can assure you she will.

437
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:22,919
- I have drugs that are quite efficient

438
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,752
if you need some help.

439
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:28,377
Colonel?

440
00:42:28,377 --> 00:42:29,210
- Yes?

441
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:32,436
I was just thinking.

442
00:42:32,436 --> 00:42:36,707
Imagine what an army of
invisible men could do.

443
00:42:36,707 --> 00:42:38,406
- Anything, Colonel.

444
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:40,323
They could do anything.

445
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,504
- Colonel, how long do you
intend to keep us here?

446
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:50,254
- You are free to go at any time.

447
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,252
(grunts)

448
00:42:56,795 --> 00:42:59,022
- [Ben] Wade, get a head
start towards the truck.

449
00:42:59,022 --> 00:43:00,439
Come on, come on!

450
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,248
- [Zanna] Come on, Ben.

451
00:43:06,007 --> 00:43:08,424
- [Ben] Back to work, ladies.

452
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:21,907
Move over!

453
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:23,990
(grunts)

454
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,440
(speaking foreign language)

455
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,932
(thuds)
(grunts)

456
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:36,099
Come on, guys!

457
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:40,636
(engine starts)

458
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,079
(alarm beeps)

459
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:58,646
- Go, go, go!

460
00:44:05,538 --> 00:44:06,578
- Go on, go on!

461
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:07,716
Come on!

462
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:10,383
(men muttering)

463
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:14,595
(wheels skid)

464
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:18,708
- Woah, hey.

465
00:44:25,418 --> 00:44:26,587
- [Ben] Jesus, it's weird not having

466
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:28,394
my hands in front of me.

467
00:44:28,394 --> 00:44:30,471
- You're doing great, Ben.

468
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:31,971
You're doing fine.

469
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,830
(car beeping)

470
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:42,895
(gun firing)

471
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:43,978
- Get closer!

472
00:44:46,272 --> 00:44:47,105
Faster!

473
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:51,385
- Jesus.

474
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:53,802
(gun firing)

475
00:44:55,638 --> 00:44:58,055
(gun firing)

476
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,836
- Oh.

477
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:09,702
- [Ben] If I get hit, do you think

478
00:45:09,702 --> 00:45:11,398
I'll be able to see my blood?

479
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:13,065
- Drive, Ben, drive!

480
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,067
(gun firing)

481
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,517
(gun firing)

482
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:38,225
(gun firing)

483
00:45:44,748 --> 00:45:46,915
(yelling)

484
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:50,261
(explosion)

485
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:02,792
- [Ben] What happened?

486
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:04,125
Did we lose him?

487
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,085
Well, we got them off our back.

488
00:46:23,085 --> 00:46:24,040
- For about five minutes, Ben.

489
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,373
He won't stay down for long.

490
00:46:29,288 --> 00:46:32,038
(dramatic music)

491
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:51,793
- Look through these documents
and take as many as you can.

492
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:52,626
- Alright.

493
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:01,594
- Zanna, we're never gonna
get all this stuff together.

494
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:03,170
We've gotta get outta here.

495
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:04,502
- I know, I know.

496
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:06,012
- So where are we going?

497
00:47:06,012 --> 00:47:07,410
- Ow!

498
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,774
- There's only one place I can think of.

499
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:12,774
And that's Dad's hold hunting lodge.

500
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,490
(tense music)

501
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:04,805
(alarm beeping)

502
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:06,279
Aw, damn, they're here.

503
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:07,445
- We're trapped.

504
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:08,414
- We'll try the backdoor.

505
00:48:08,414 --> 00:48:10,676
- They probably have the house surrounded.

506
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:13,093
- Come out with your hands up

507
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:16,584
and no harm will come to you.

508
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:32,515
- [Wade] Ah, Colonel,
what a nice surprise.

509
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:34,314
I thought we'd lost you back there.

510
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:37,368
- Where is Dr. Zimmer and that thing?

511
00:48:37,368 --> 00:48:39,072
- Oh, I'm sorry,

512
00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:40,822
you just missed them.

513
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:43,577
- Search the house.

514
00:49:22,673 --> 00:49:25,503
How do you operate this machine?

515
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,907
- Well, we're still working on that.

516
00:49:27,907 --> 00:49:31,416
I don't mind telling you
he's a little temperamental.

517
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,916
- Colonel, the house is empty.

518
00:49:36,561 --> 00:49:38,308
- Bring this man.

519
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,058
And this machine too.

520
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:04,409
(mysterious music)

521
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,456
(tense music)

522
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,575
(blows)

523
00:50:46,575 --> 00:50:48,575
(blows)

524
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:52,458
(blows)

525
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,980
- [Ben] Cigarettes are
bad for your health.

526
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,109
(grunts)

527
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:58,109
(thuds)

528
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,812
- Ben, you okay?

529
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:08,645
- [Ben] Piece o' cake.

530
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,423
Let's go.

531
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:14,062
- Here, get dressed.

532
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:20,776
(engine starts)

533
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:28,339
- Incompetent stupid idiot.

534
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:30,086
(glass shatters)

535
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,599
I told Ryder to be careful!

536
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:34,516
He wasn't smart enough!

537
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:37,440
(sobs)

538
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,847
And Zanna has disappeared.

539
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:50,743
Now where

540
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:55,196
would that limited intelligence take her?

541
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:04,781
(birds chirping)

542
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:22,434
- This is great.

543
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:26,601
- [Zanna] Yeah, I haven't
been her in a long time.

544
00:52:48,963 --> 00:52:50,939
- You keep it really nice.

545
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:55,106
- Well, there's cleaning
supplies in the kitchen, Ben.

546
00:53:15,265 --> 00:53:17,777
Join me for cocktails?

547
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,025
- I'd prefer a margarita.

548
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:22,889
- Sorry, all we've got is Molotov.

549
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:24,389
- Happy hour, huh?

550
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:28,598
- I have a feeling we're gonna need it.

551
00:53:31,282 --> 00:53:33,078
- Pretty weird seeing that photo of Drago

552
00:53:33,078 --> 00:53:34,911
and your dad up there.

553
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:40,556
- It's hard to believe they
were best friends once.

554
00:53:40,556 --> 00:53:43,750
Used to come up here all the time.

555
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,664
They hunted and talked

556
00:53:45,664 --> 00:53:49,831
and when they got back
they always had a new idea.

557
00:53:50,848 --> 00:53:53,450
It was a good time for all of us.

558
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:54,283
- Yeah.

559
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:58,124
- Well, they're both gone now.

560
00:53:58,124 --> 00:54:00,041
Top this off, will you?

561
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:07,555
- [Petroff] Doctor Franklin,
I hope you slept well.

562
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:09,805
- Like a prince, thank you.

563
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:16,109
- I have some questions for
you that I hope you can answer.

564
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:18,774
- [Wade] Well, I'll certainly try.

565
00:54:18,774 --> 00:54:22,204
- First, I would like
to know about the death

566
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:24,321
of Dr. Karl Zimmer.

567
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:26,602
- Gee, I dunno anything about that.

568
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:31,478
- Are you associated with a
CIA agent called Joe Smith?

569
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:32,478
- Joe Smith?

570
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:34,764
Sorry.

571
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:38,649
(groans)

572
00:54:42,524 --> 00:54:44,968
- Now we are on equal footing.

573
00:54:44,968 --> 00:54:46,051
- Go to Hell.

574
00:54:48,272 --> 00:54:51,782
- One of my soldiers present
when Dr. Zimmer was killed

575
00:54:51,782 --> 00:54:54,199
talked about this huge robot,

576
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:56,621
indestructible.

577
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:00,118
Unfortunately he was
killed and so were all

578
00:55:00,118 --> 00:55:01,701
the others present.

579
00:55:02,614 --> 00:55:06,065
The only one left was Miss Zimmer.

580
00:55:06,065 --> 00:55:08,904
She claimed that they had been ambushed

581
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:12,154
but it was never clear by whom and why.

582
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:20,261
Do you know what I think, Dr. Franklin?

583
00:55:20,261 --> 00:55:22,261
- Ask someone who cares.

584
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:27,455
- I think that the CIA was
interested in buying this thing.

585
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:31,026
Something went wrong.

586
00:55:31,026 --> 00:55:35,193
You wound up in a wheelchair
and Dr. Zimmer was killed.

587
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:39,784
- That's a wild story.

588
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:44,376
I guess that's why they pay
you the big bucks, right?

589
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:45,626
- Dr. Franklin.

590
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:51,446
You and I are going to
have a very, very nice

591
00:55:53,324 --> 00:55:54,157
long talk.

592
00:55:56,163 --> 00:56:00,330
And you, you are going to tell
me everything I want to know.

593
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:10,620
- Woah, woah.

594
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,671
That cabin should be empty.

595
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:17,171
Let's have a look.

596
00:56:21,197 --> 00:56:24,150
- Ben, here's some more Supercon

597
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,733
in case you need to
become invisible again.

598
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,140
(gargling)

599
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:50,622
(whistles)

600
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:51,955
- What was that?

601
00:57:12,102 --> 00:57:14,185
(groans)

602
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:18,574
(chuckling)

603
00:57:24,613 --> 00:57:27,763
- We have to come up
with a plan to get Wade.

604
00:57:27,763 --> 00:57:31,180
He's been in there too long already, Ben.

605
00:57:32,313 --> 00:57:35,264
I can count on you, right?

606
00:57:35,264 --> 00:57:37,681
- You can always count on me.

607
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:41,481
Don't worry, he's gonna be okay.

608
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:45,128
- Ben...

609
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:48,292
- Hey.

610
00:57:49,143 --> 00:57:50,425
Don't worry.

611
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:54,664
I'll just go find myself a
nice invisible girl somewhere.

612
00:57:54,664 --> 00:57:55,497
- Yeah.

613
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,432
- I'm gonna get the stuff out of the car.

614
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:32,406
(grunts)

615
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:41,036
- Why don't you cooperate

616
00:58:41,036 --> 00:58:45,068
and free yourself from the
misery that you are in?

617
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:46,224
- Misery?

618
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:47,530
Are you kiddin'?

619
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,521
I call this character building.

620
00:58:50,521 --> 00:58:53,381
- You're a tough man, Dr. Franklin.

621
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:57,422
I can see I have to use a
different method with you.

622
00:58:57,422 --> 00:59:01,589
Virginia, get Dr. Knox and
tell him to bring his drugs.

623
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:08,551
(glass shatters)
(men laughing)

624
00:59:08,551 --> 00:59:10,718
(screams)

625
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:16,515
(yelling)

626
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,990
(screaming)

627
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:38,475
(men yelling)

628
00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:52,205
- I wish you hadn't killed my friend!

629
00:59:57,101 --> 00:59:59,934
(Zanna screaming)

630
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:12,936
- Hey!

631
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,530
(gun firing)

632
01:00:29,052 --> 01:00:31,885
(emotional music)

633
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:51,343
(breathing)
(footfalls)

634
01:00:58,182 --> 01:01:02,182
(man yells in foreign language)

635
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,532
(slaps)
(yelps)

636
01:01:19,532 --> 01:01:23,532
(woman speaks foreign language)

637
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,969
- You will just feel a little sting

638
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:43,796
and then we'll talk about everything.

639
01:01:43,796 --> 01:01:45,748
- You're too kind.

640
01:01:45,748 --> 01:01:47,998
(knocking)

641
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,657
- Get on with it.

642
01:02:04,736 --> 01:02:05,569
- What?

643
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:11,675
(tense music)

644
01:02:14,554 --> 01:02:15,387
- Doctor?

645
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:16,500
(thuds)
(grunts)

646
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,798
- Ben?

647
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:20,548
- [Ben] I think I need some help.

648
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:24,758
- You invisible son of a bitch.

649
01:02:24,758 --> 01:02:26,841
(grunts)

650
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:31,947
- You wanted to know
how I worked, Colonel?

651
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:33,114
So study this.

652
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:36,752
(grunts)

653
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:39,354
(groans)

654
01:02:39,354 --> 01:02:41,730
- [Ben] Come on, let's
get out of here fast.

655
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,730
- Good idea.

656
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:51,963
(speaks foreign language)

657
01:02:51,963 --> 01:02:53,251
(thuds)

658
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:55,249
(clanks)

659
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:57,249
(thuds)

660
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:07,835
- Hold it!
(gun firing)

661
01:03:07,835 --> 01:03:09,918
(grunts)

662
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,467
(alarm beeping)

663
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,715
(engine starts)

664
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,215
(guns firing)

665
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:39,044
- [Drago] Find anything interesting?

666
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,300
(gasps)

667
01:03:57,671 --> 01:04:00,117
- How can you be alive?

668
01:04:00,117 --> 01:04:02,279
- There are so many things
about the human body

669
01:04:02,279 --> 01:04:04,683
you don't understand, Zanna.

670
01:04:04,683 --> 01:04:08,774
And that's why the invisibility
secret keeps escaping you.

671
01:04:08,774 --> 01:04:11,475
- Ryder worked for you, didn't he?

672
01:04:11,475 --> 01:04:12,975
- Very good guess.

673
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:17,969
I needed the Supercon
formula and now I have it.

674
01:04:17,969 --> 01:04:19,552
- You have nothing.

675
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:24,223
- Little Zanna, still
trying to be the scientist.

676
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:26,507
You're a lost girl in need of guidance.

677
01:04:26,507 --> 01:04:27,992
- Let go of me you son of a bitch!

678
01:04:27,992 --> 01:04:30,153
- Ah, a fighting spirit.

679
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:30,986
I like it.

680
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,533
You know Zanna, I can
think of only one way

681
01:04:37,533 --> 01:04:39,783
you'll be of any use to me.

682
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:44,360
(mysterious music)

683
01:04:51,258 --> 01:04:54,175
(brakes squeaking)

684
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:03,679
(screaming)

685
01:05:04,556 --> 01:05:07,723
(dinnerware clanking)

686
01:05:14,194 --> 01:05:16,896
(Drago yells)

687
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:19,938
- Pump, pump, pump.
(clapping)

688
01:05:19,938 --> 01:05:21,355
Pump, pump, pump.

689
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,135
Pump, pump, pump.

690
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:28,831
(exotic music)

691
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,331
(men jeering)

692
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:56,922
(beeping)

693
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:05,696
- I can't get up these.

694
01:06:05,696 --> 01:06:08,188
You're gonna have to go it alone, okay?

695
01:06:08,188 --> 01:06:09,021
- Okay.

696
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:18,950
Let's go.

697
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:33,800
(men yelling)
(clapping)

698
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:45,340
- Do you like this, Uncle Ivan?

699
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,610
Don't move or I'll slit his throat!

700
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,542
- Very impressive, Zanna.

701
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,068
- Shut up, you're coming with me.

702
01:06:57,068 --> 01:06:59,483
- Why don't you cut my throat, huh?

703
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:00,816
Go ahead, do it!

704
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,467
You can't do it, you are too weak, Zanna.

705
01:07:17,435 --> 01:07:19,268
- [Drago] Feed on her!

706
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:36,181
- No.

707
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:37,292
No.

708
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:38,140
No!

709
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,326
- Don't be afraid.

710
01:07:39,326 --> 01:07:40,672
We're here to help you.

711
01:07:40,672 --> 01:07:42,942
We're looking for a blonde
girl they just brought in.

712
01:07:42,942 --> 01:07:44,192
- I don't know.

713
01:07:45,988 --> 01:07:48,498
We're not allowed to talk to each other.

714
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:49,598
- Okay.

715
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,181
Come on, let's get out of here.

716
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:58,971
(men yelling)

717
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,041
- Don't run, Zanna.
(screaming)

718
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:25,849
Don't run, Zanna.

719
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:28,932
Why not enjoy the time you have left?

720
01:08:44,172 --> 01:08:46,422
(groaning)

721
01:08:59,408 --> 01:09:01,073
- She's not here, Ben.

722
01:09:01,073 --> 01:09:01,906
- [Ben] Okay.

723
01:09:01,906 --> 01:09:04,856
Take the back stairs and get
as far away from this place

724
01:09:04,856 --> 01:09:06,341
as possible.

725
01:09:06,341 --> 01:09:07,357
- Who are you?

726
01:09:07,357 --> 01:09:08,695
- [Ben] Never mind that.

727
01:09:08,695 --> 01:09:10,862
Just get outta here quick.

728
01:09:14,938 --> 01:09:17,438
(tense music)

729
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:32,843
(screams)

730
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:39,889
(Drago yells)

731
01:09:41,892 --> 01:09:43,505
- Zanna, dear.

732
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:46,755
You are exactly where I want you to be.

733
01:09:47,864 --> 01:09:49,343
(high-pitched scream)

734
01:09:49,343 --> 01:09:50,797
- [Ben] What the hell was that?

735
01:09:50,797 --> 01:09:53,832
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

736
01:09:53,832 --> 01:09:56,332
(men jeering)

737
01:10:02,654 --> 01:10:05,404
(Zanna groaning)

738
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:15,168
- How are you feeling, Zanna?

739
01:10:15,168 --> 01:10:17,003
- Go to Hell.

740
01:10:17,003 --> 01:10:20,003
- Getting a little nervous, my dear?

741
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:25,353
(laughs)

742
01:10:32,486 --> 01:10:33,999
(thuds)

743
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:35,049
What are you doing?

744
01:10:35,049 --> 01:10:35,882
Imbeciles!

745
01:10:42,619 --> 01:10:45,974
Don't be afraid, it's only a machine.

746
01:10:45,974 --> 01:10:47,969
Kill the machine!

747
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:50,469
(men yelling)

748
01:10:56,087 --> 01:10:57,290
Goodbye, Zanna.

749
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,666
- [Ben] Not so fast.

750
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,050
(gasps)

751
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:02,773
- Oh, Benjamin, my boy,

752
01:11:02,773 --> 01:11:05,606
are you back on your safety pills?

753
01:11:06,856 --> 01:11:10,234
(sword slices)
(grunts)

754
01:11:10,234 --> 01:11:12,401
(yelling)

755
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:21,878
- I'm gonna break you in two.

756
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:23,994
(Drago speaks foreign language)

757
01:11:23,994 --> 01:11:26,161
(screams)

758
01:11:32,963 --> 01:11:34,270
Hold on, Zanna.

759
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:35,894
I got you.

760
01:11:35,894 --> 01:11:37,477
Come on, it's okay.

761
01:11:39,737 --> 01:11:40,852
There you are.

762
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:42,330
Are you alright?

763
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,330
- Yeah, but Ben is hurt.

764
01:11:48,057 --> 01:11:49,113
Ben.

765
01:11:49,113 --> 01:11:51,131
Ben, can you hear me?

766
01:11:51,131 --> 01:11:53,489
- [Ben] Yeah, he didn't cut of my ears.

767
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:55,138
- Come on guys, we gotta get outta here.

768
01:11:55,138 --> 01:11:56,706
- Not yet.

769
01:11:56,706 --> 01:12:00,123
I can't let Drago get away a second time.

770
01:12:23,462 --> 01:12:26,365
(dagger unsheathes)
(yelling)

771
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:28,448
(grunts)

772
01:12:37,115 --> 01:12:39,532
(gun firing)

773
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:53,287
(glass shatters)

774
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:31,201
(yells)

775
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:33,868
(intense music)

776
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,247
- Now Zanna, end of the road.

777
01:14:14,497 --> 01:14:16,497
(gasps)

778
01:14:24,361 --> 01:14:26,861
(exhales) No.

779
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:37,254
I need some air.

780
01:14:56,952 --> 01:14:59,952
(breathing heavily)

781
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:05,678
(yells)

782
01:15:07,267 --> 01:15:09,684
(body thuds)

783
01:15:14,641 --> 01:15:17,974
(soothing violin music)

784
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:38,243
- Okay, enemies of the state, let's go.

785
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,988
The border's half an hour away.

786
01:15:39,988 --> 01:15:41,939
- We haven't decided
where we're going yet.

787
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:43,265
- Wasn't it the US?

788
01:15:43,265 --> 01:15:44,596
- Ben, it's a big country.

789
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:47,145
- I always wanted to see
New York or Los Angeles.

790
01:15:47,145 --> 01:15:48,681
- What about Washington?

791
01:15:48,681 --> 01:15:49,764
- Washington.

792
01:15:51,217 --> 01:15:53,790
- (giggles) Yeah, Washington.

793
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:56,040
I think we'll fit right in.

794
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:08,558
(glasses beep)
(engine starts)

795
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:42,408
(epic orchestral music)

796
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:39,992
(soft violin music)
