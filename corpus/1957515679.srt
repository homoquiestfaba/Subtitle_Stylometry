1
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,560
Hey everybody and
welcome to another episode

2
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,711
of the Terrible Terror Podcast.

3
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:30,915
And I'm joined as always

4
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,929
by my co-host from across the pond, Neil.

5
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,700
Hey Neil, how's it going?

6
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,646
I'm doing great Brian.

7
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:38,219
Really looking forward to
talking about this thing

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,950
you emailed me about this morning.

9
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,993
Thanks for tuning into
92.9, The Raven this morning,

10
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,625
I'm Gil T. Smith.

11
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:47,800
We have breaking news, the
Lawford County Sheriff's office

12
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:50,218
has announced they will be
releasing items collected

13
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,019
as evidence in the gruesome 2010

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,018
and 2011 Unlisted Owner murders.

15
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:58,225
The actual footage
from a series of murders

16
00:00:58,226 --> 00:00:59,495
and disappearances that occurred

17
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:03,161
in Lawford County,
Illinois in 2010 and 2011

18
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:05,596
is getting a worldwide release.

19
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:07,693
And for our final segment
tonight on Angry Dad Podcast,

20
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:09,377
we will be talking about the release

21
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:11,755
of the up-and-coming film, Unlisted Owner.

22
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:14,371
Hey everyone, welcome
to Clint's Crime Corner,

23
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:16,325
I'm your host, Clint Buckler coming at you

24
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,794
from the great white north.

25
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:20,107
Now if you recall back in 2011,

26
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,714
we covered a series of
murders that took place

27
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,829
in Lawford County, Illinois,
known as the Owner Killings.

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,140
And for today's episode,

29
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,388
we're gonna dive right
back into that mystery.

30
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,327
Welcome to the Smores Indoors podcast

31
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:32,569
my name is Corey, your host

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,002
and I am joined as always by Jonathan.

33
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:36,626
Jonathan, what's going on?

34
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:37,767
Not a whole lot.

35
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:40,029
Excited for tonight's show
and excited to talk about

36
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,565
the real crime scene evidence
from the Owner Killings

37
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:44,195
in Lawford County, Illinois.

38
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:45,429
So from now to Halloween,
I'll be naming off

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,423
my bucket list of haunted
places I wanna visit.

40
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:51,007
So my first pick is

41
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:56,055
the Owner House in
Lawford County, Illinois.

42
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:57,249
A family of five was murdered

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,553
in the house they'd just moved into.

44
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,824
And now they're saying
that there are six people

45
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,337
that are missing, plus a cop.

46
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:07,615
They're calling this, The Owner Killings.

47
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:10,211
I mean this sounds like
a movie plot come to life.

48
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:14,197
This film has the horror
community divided into two.

49
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:15,473
Alright, we're talking about people

50
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:19,296
that feel films should just
be films based on fictional

51
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:23,221
or real events, nothing
real about it, alright?

52
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,551
But on the other side of the argument,

53
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:27,631
we have actual terror,
we have actual fear,

54
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:29,113
we have actual horror.

55
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:33,781
No smoke and mirrors, no
fucking stunt doubles, alright?

56
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:37,906
Actual fear, actual
terror that we can see.

57
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,177
I've always been so
intrigued by not only

58
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,921
the murders and disappearances
that happened there,

59
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:46,162
but this beautiful house, ugh, I love it.

60
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:47,920
Since we mentioned
it in the past episode,

61
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:50,586
you're likely aware that
in order to renew interest

62
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,341
in this case again, the family
of the victims have agreed

63
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:55,321
to the release of the footage from

64
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:57,012
the night these events took place

65
00:02:57,013 --> 00:03:00,187
in hopes of getting
some sort of new leads.

66
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:02,355
Now, before you asked, yes

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,478
they are releasing the
actual murder footage.

68
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,209
Yeah, it's hard to
believe this is happening.

69
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,446
To have these murders that took place

70
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:13,003
in our backyard coming to a
TV near you, it's just insane.

71
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:16,345
Yeah man, I mean, I was just
in Lawford County yesterday.

72
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,823
Let's just say that the people are livid,

73
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,341
that the families are allowing this.

74
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:22,590
Hey y'all just wanted
to reach out to you

75
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,093
and let everybody know, stay
away from South Main near

76
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,163
the Lawford County Courthouse.

77
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,293
There's a large crowd out there,

78
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:29,593
and they're probably protesting release

79
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:31,168
of the murder footage.

80
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,449
We would also like to report

81
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,004
that class will be dismissed early today

82
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,513
as a result of the protest
occurring all over the community,

83
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:39,563
after recent announcements

84
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:41,517
from the Lawford County
Sheriff's Department.

85
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:44,441
Should this film just stay inside

86
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:46,604
the Lawford County evidence locker,

87
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:48,269
or should it be released?

88
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,820
Comment down below, let
me know your thoughts.

89
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,516
And I know, you wanna know
what I think about this.

90
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:54,702
It's disgusting.

91
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,526
Completely disgusting, in my opinion.

92
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,443
I feel like it's a cash grab.

93
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,553
And I understand what the what
the families went through,

94
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:01,664
it was completely horrible.

95
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:03,778
But being the true crime buff that I am,

96
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:05,806
I'm down with reenactments of crimes,

97
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,822
but not seeing the actual
footage of the murders.

98
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,590
And how the Lawford County
Sheriff's Department

99
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:14,158
can even allow this, it's
completely beyond me.

100
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,448
As you know, Clint's
Crime Corner had to make

101
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,323
an attempt at reaching out

102
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,748
to the Lawford County Sheriff's Department

103
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,069
for a comment on the matter.

104
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,118
But, as predicted, we never
got a response from them.

105
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,788
But I mean, if the families think

106
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,034
this'll help them get answers,
and it's gonna entertain

107
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,941
the public, well, I'm cool with that.

108
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,078
Yeah, same here.

109
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,819
Hey everyone, hit that subscribe button

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,019
because as soon as we find
out when the footage from

111
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,589
The Owner Killings in
Lawford County's coming out,

112
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,520
we will let you all know.

113
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,378
Are we gonna review this
thing when it comes out?

114
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:45,614
I mean, I don't know.

115
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:49,022
I mean, now that you say it,
it does sound kinda morbid.

116
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,099
You know what, screw it.

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,832
We're gonna review it, we're gonna do it.

118
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,825
We're gonna do it.

119
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,735
Alright folks, you've heard it here.

120
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:59,569
Come back for a full review,
when the footage is released.

121
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:41,810
Hey dad, need
any help with that box?

122
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,009
No I got it, honey.

123
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,260
Okay.

124
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,627
Hey Chloe, can you grab the door for me?

125
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:54,878
Sure.

126
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,339
Trenton, can you go
grab that for sale sign

127
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,599
out of the yard?

128
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,850
- Alright.
- Thanks, buddy.

129
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:07,903
Hey dad, that
box looks really heavy,

130
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:09,170
what did mom pack in it?

131
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,783
Trust me, enough.

132
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:13,034
Hey mister, I heard that.

133
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,085
It's just really hard, dad.

134
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:17,986
Having to leave all my friends behind

135
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:21,333
and having to do all of it in high school.

136
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,773
I know sweetie,
but this is the only place

137
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,614
I can get a teaching job

138
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,633
and trust me, you'll meet new friends.

139
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:31,120
I don't want new
friends, I want my friends.

140
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:34,271
You're not the only
one making sacrifices.

141
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,840
I know you guys are still
mad at us for this move,

142
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:39,989
but look at this big house.

143
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,980
Gimme a couple years, I'll fix
it up, and you will love it.

144
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,073
It'll be perfect.

145
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:47,449
Hey, is there a key to unlock this door?

146
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,283
I don't know,

147
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,126
why don't you try the bolt first, stupid?

148
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,359
Hey, you guys need to get outside

149
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,443
and help your dad unload those boxes.

150
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:01,814
I don't know what to do.

151
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,066
I think someone's in the house.

152
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,085
I don't know where everybody is.

153
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:07,708
I just don't-

154
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,824
- Chloe, what the hell is going on?

155
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:14,006
I think someone's in the house.

156
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,117
There's no one in the
house honey, come on.

157
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:19,174
Everything's gonna be okay.

158
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,352
Let's just get back in our sleeping bags.

159
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,025
You know the furniture is
gonna be here tomorrow.

160
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,986
Come on, let's go.

161
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,712
It's okay.

162
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,613
Dude, you ready to get

163
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,824
your ass kicked at this game tonight?

164
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,658
Oh fuck dude,

165
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,876
it's gonna be a repeat
of the fuckin' beer pong.

166
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,151
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen to you.

167
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,171
- Dude, hey?
- What?

168
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,005
Are you gonna help us
or are you gonna play

169
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,162
with the camera all day?

170
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:02,427
Dude I just got
this thing, you know that.

171
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:03,261
I'm just trying to focus in-

172
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:04,094
- I don't give a shit.

173
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,640
Oh yeah, why don't you focus that thing

174
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:06,474
on your little dick.

175
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,310
If it sees that, then
you've got a good camera.

176
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,699
Dude, whatever, you
just trying to see this thing.

177
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,915
Let me see this thing.

178
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,086
Give me my camera back.

179
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,263
Dude, if you're gonna use my camera

180
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,246
at least use it right.

181
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:15,490
Get off me.

182
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:16,750
All right, all right, all right.

183
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:18,015
No seriously, gimme my camera back.

184
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:18,967
No, man.

185
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:19,968
So how bad do you have to fuck up

186
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:21,817
for mom and dad to buy
you this piece of shit?

187
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:22,718
Dude, you don't always have to bring

188
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,237
my parents into everything, okay?

189
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:25,514
My parents did not buy that for me.

190
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:26,677
I bought it with my own money.

191
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:28,154
- Gosh, give me a break.
- Uh-huh.

192
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,839
Whoa, whoa, Jed
seriously calm down, man.

193
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,858
No dude, he always brings
my parents into this stuff.

194
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:33,692
I'm tired-

195
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,525
- Dude, hey.
- What?

196
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:36,162
Gavin, I think you may
have offended the poor guy.

197
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:39,187
Oh, he knows I'm
kidding, don't you Jed?

198
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:41,202
You know I'm kidding, man.

199
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:42,404
I'm tired of this shit.

200
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:43,679
Let's get this stuff loaded.

201
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,847
Oh, hold on.

202
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:46,589
No, come here.

203
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,738
Whoa, whoa dude, seriously.

204
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:49,006
- No, seriously.
- Time out.

205
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,165
More important shit than
messing with your little camera.

206
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,128
- Oh yeah, like what?
- Hold on.

207
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,206
Hey man, I told you about
this chick I been texting?

208
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,465
No, what's her name?

209
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,633
Stacey, and she is hot.

210
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:00,815
Does she have any friends?

211
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,427
- Yes.
- Without herpes?

212
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,567
Well, She has a friend.

213
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:07,270
We'll have to look into that second part.

214
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:10,485
Her name is and she is also hot.

215
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,201
Yeah, what's it matter if
she has herpes anyways Gavin?

216
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:13,036
You'll still fuck her.

217
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,069
Yeah, but if she has herpes,

218
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,108
I might wear a condom,

219
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:17,347
if you know what I'm talking
about, Jed.

220
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:19,507
Let me know how that goes for you.

221
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:20,459
It'll be the same as always

222
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,747
and I'll be the only one getting laid.

223
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:23,294
- You guys won't-
- Here he goes.

224
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,624
- Okay.
- Listen.

225
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,098
The only way that you
and you will get anything

226
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,825
is if you fuck each
other, I'm just saying.

227
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:29,828
Best you got right there.

228
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,074
Oh no, no, I'm just getting warmed up.

229
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:31,976
I'll be in the tent

230
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,688
you know, getting it on, you know, nasty.

231
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:35,522
And you guys are gonna be out there

232
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,125
just roasting your little marshmallows

233
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,111
like "Oh, mine's on fire,
blow on it, blow on it".

234
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,377
Oh okay, Jed, Jed.

235
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:41,987
So you're going to get fucked
tonight is what you're saying?

236
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:42,948
You know it.

237
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:44,660
Okay, I'll be the one doing the fucking.

238
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:47,900
Uh-huh, with your fucking hand.

239
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:49,850
Hey, you be good to him tonight.

240
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,464
Get off me seriously,
that's not even funny.

241
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,035
Let's just get this shit loaded up.

242
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:55,181
Oh man, stop whining.

243
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,015
Gimme a hand

244
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:57,628
Hand me the tent.

245
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,229
Oh, you had to pick up
the fucking heavy one

246
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,063
didn't ya, macho man?

247
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,063
Dude, help me you shit.

248
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:03,572
Here, hand me that other one.

249
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:06,479
Oh, dude.

250
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,854
Oh shit, you fucking assholes.

251
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,144
Dude, you so should've seen

252
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:10,978
your fucking face, man.

253
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,632
No, no, it's not even cool.

254
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,309
Not even fucking cool.

255
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,436
No, seriously.

256
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:16,811
The fuck's your problem, dude?

257
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,066
Dude, we didn't even get
your fucking personal camera.

258
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,016
Dude, it doesn't matter.

259
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:20,849
It's the principal of the fact, what?

260
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:21,848
Hey, hey hey, calm down.

261
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,447
We wouldn't do anything
to your little camera.

262
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,297
Only to you, bitch.

263
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,326
Dude I don't give a shit.

264
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:27,709
You guys always do this stuff to me

265
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,749
when Griffin's not around
to mess with, I'm tired.

266
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,217
Oh, fucking quit your whining.

267
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,335
You didn't even get wet.

268
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:32,561
Dude, it's the
principle of the fact.

269
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:33,727
Calm down, you're being a bitch.

270
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:34,723
No dude I don't even care.

271
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:35,786
What, what'd you-

272
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:36,882
- Did you hear what happened?

273
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:37,716
What are you talking about?

274
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:38,549
Turn on the radio.

275
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:39,382
What do you
mean, turn on the radio?

276
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:41,722
- Just turn on the radio.
- No.

277
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:43,806
Turn on the radio, Gavin.

278
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:48,931
Just in case

279
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:49,986
you're just tuning in, breaking news from

280
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:51,730
the Lawford County Sheriff's Department.

281
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:53,045
A family of five has been found dead

282
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,694
in their home this morning around 8:15am.

283
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:55,835
See, told you guys.

284
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:57,206
Any other details-

285
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,040
- That's pretty crazy.

286
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,394
Posted
with any future updates,

287
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:01,838
here on 95.9 The Raven.

288
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,139
I can't believe that.

289
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,723
Hey, here's Griff, he's coming.

290
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:10,636
Hey, what's up man?

291
00:12:10,637 --> 00:12:12,854
Hey, you guys aren't gonna believe

292
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,710
what we just saw on the way here.

293
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:15,953
What you talking about?

294
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:18,861
To do with, anything with

295
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:21,306
the family of five that was
found dead in their house today?

296
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,716
Yeah, you should see the house, man.

297
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:26,042
There's police cars and
ambulances everywhere.

298
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,767
You should see all the
people out there, it's crazy.

299
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,685
I can't even imagine.

300
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:38,577
It's probably about a
mile off the camp site.

301
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,707
Right on the edge of town.

302
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,017
Man.

303
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,810
Dude, it's the big
yellow one right across

304
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,087
from the Wooler's place.

305
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:47,044
That's crazy.

306
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,733
Dude, they just bought that
house not even a week ago.

307
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,269
Fucking bad luck for them, right?

308
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,182
No shit man.

309
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,034
You guys are dumb.

310
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:55,867
That's not even funny.

311
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:56,792
Not even cool, guys.

312
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,899
- Hey, we're mature.
- Yeah.

313
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:05,112
How about this, let's go
see who's all out there.

314
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:06,931
- I'm in.
- Game?

315
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,182
Griffin, you lead the way.

316
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:09,371
- Let's go.
- Road trip.

317
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,539
Alright, let's go.

318
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:24,779
Dude, look at
this place, holy shit.

319
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,982
Dude, you got that thing on, right?

320
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:26,986
Yeah dude, it's rolling.

321
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,477
Man, I'll tell you what,
this is gonna be sweet.

322
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:31,991
What's sweet about people's
lives that were lost?

323
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,272
Tell me you're not a little excited

324
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:35,028
about seeing some dead bodies.

325
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,761
No, I'm actually kinda freaked out.

326
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:37,595
Andrea, just chill.

327
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:38,720
It'll be all right, I promise.

328
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:39,554
Right.

329
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:42,300
You know we're just joking
around anyway, Andrea.

330
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:44,051
You know what, you might
as well get used to it

331
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:47,644
because you're gonna be
with us all night long.

332
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,619
Get away from me, you dumb ass.

333
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,630
Jed, are you seriously gonna
have that camera on here?

334
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,464
Dude, there's nothing illegal

335
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,710
about having your camera on.

336
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,549
It's gonna be good footage.

337
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,897
How about we have a
little respect for the dead.

338
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,277
Dude, there is
nothing disrespectful

339
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:00,856
about having your camera on, okay?

340
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:03,243
News crews do it all the
time, so just back off.

341
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:05,296
It never can be used if you-

342
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:07,744
- There he goes again, being
a little bitch like always.

343
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:08,623
No kidding.

344
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,412
You go again, being a dick like always.

345
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,984
Aww, listen to her,
we love you too Haidee.

346
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,976
Shut up, don't touch me.

347
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,423
We should just leave, Griffin.

348
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:18,232
I dunno, I kind of wanna
to see what happened.

349
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,180
Fine.

350
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:20,456
You wanna know what happened?

351
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:21,865
I'll find out what happened.

352
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:22,699
Whoa dude, what are you doing?

353
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:23,532
- Hey, whoa, whoa.
- I'm gonna go-

354
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,408
- No, you walk around...

355
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:27,881
Fuck you guys.

356
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,036
This is gonna be sweet.

357
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,367
This is so crazy.

358
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,277
Oh my God.

359
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:44,933
Are they really bringing someone out?

360
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:45,934
Oh my God.

361
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,604
Dude, are you kidding me?

362
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:51,806
- Holy crap.
- Oh my God.

363
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,614
- That is crazy.
- No way.

364
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:56,487
Oh my God.

365
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:59,738
Dude, I wonder what happened.

366
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:00,575
This is fucking nuts.

367
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,908
That is so gross.

368
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:05,906
Oh my God.

369
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:08,584
I don't even wanna watch it.

370
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:10,668
This is nasty.

371
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:23,573
Holy shit.

372
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:27,944
Why would they bring him out

373
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:28,812
in front of everybody?

374
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:29,872
Well what else are they gonna do?

375
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:33,796
They got him in a body
bag, that's good enough.

376
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,319
I've never
seen anything like this.

377
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,570
Dude, that is nuts.

378
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:47,096
How many people lived here?

379
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,918
I think they said five.

380
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,115
I only saw them bring
out one though, body.

381
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:53,184
Is that all you saw?

382
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,351
Just one?

383
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,769
Yeah.

384
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:02,082
Fucking crazy shit.

385
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:09,561
Did they get
all the rest of them out?

386
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:11,559
Yeah, I don't know.

387
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,500
This is crazy.

388
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,762
I don't believe this shit.

389
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:16,846
Could give you nightmares.

390
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:23,695
Ah, this is freaking nuts.

391
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:24,784
Yeah.

392
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:25,618
You guys seen what's goin' on?

393
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,363
Dude, what the fuck Tanner?

394
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:28,197
Son of a bitch, dude.

395
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,940
Don't be sneaking up
on us like that, man.

396
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:31,025
- God.
- Are you serious?

397
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,666
We're a little uneasy as it is.

398
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,687
From what I been hearing,
they're all murdered.

399
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:37,418
I think it's a serial killer.

400
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,675
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, right.

401
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:39,751
Man, what gives you that idea,

402
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:40,647
there hasn't been a murder here

403
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:43,918
for like eight years
or something like that.

404
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,356
Like 15 years ago, this place
almost burned to the ground.

405
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:48,322
Can you remember that?

406
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,316
- That was this place?
- Right here.

407
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:53,764
I didn't even realize that.

408
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:55,583
What do you think happened then?

409
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:58,731
Well, from all the stories,
this is what I think.

410
00:16:58,732 --> 00:16:59,979
The guy was a union worker

411
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,529
and he wasn't at the house all the time.

412
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,534
But the wife was always there,
and she was cheating on him.

413
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,967
The kids even knew about it,
the whole town knew about it.

414
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:14,885
The one day he did find
out, he went ballistic.

415
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:17,748
He comes over to the
house, locks them all up

416
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:19,803
in the basement, shuts all the windows,

417
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:22,054
and sets the place on fire.

418
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:26,852
When the police arrived, they
said they found five bodies.

419
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:33,109
I don't think they found Tom's body.

420
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,718
Ever since then, things
have been going crazy.

421
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,318
Like what?

422
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,814
I know a couple guys have
been falling off ladders.

423
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:44,625
A guy lost this thumb.

424
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:45,819
Man, this is stupid.

425
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,378
That sounds like another
dumb ass ghost story to me.

426
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:51,224
Think whatever you want,
but they're dead now, okay?

427
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:52,058
Whatever, man.

428
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,096
How about this for your ghost story, okay?

429
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:00,206
That people came down here,

430
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,284
they family, alright?

431
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,105
They were probably halfway.

432
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:08,016
- No, no, no
- That's a ghost story.

433
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,619
Telling you the story,
tried helping you out.

434
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,364
If you don't believe me, fine.

435
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,540
I'm outta here.

436
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,382
All right, see you Tanner.

437
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,737
You guys are fuckin' assholes.

438
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:15,671
Dude, that story is bullshit.

439
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:16,772
You guys wanted
to know what happened,

440
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:18,475
he tried telling you.

441
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:20,685
His story sounds legit to me.

442
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:22,196
Whatever, dude.

443
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:23,117
I don't know guys.

444
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,091
I just know that I
don't want to go camping

445
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:26,860
this close to where
someone's been murdered.

446
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:30,198
Hey, you heard the douche
bag, it's like hearsay.

447
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:33,173
Nobody freaking got
murdered or any of that.

448
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:35,078
Where else are we
gonna go camping, anyway?

449
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,199
I don't know, we can
just go somewhere else.

450
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,940
This is the only
land any of our families own.

451
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,173
Seriously, come on man.

452
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:41,039
And we're already here.

453
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,319
We decided to stay so you two
might as well stay with us.

454
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,556
It just wouldn't be the same without you.

455
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,508
That's true.

456
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,288
You wanted to go camping for a month now.

457
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,054
Yeah Griff,
seriously stop being a pussy.

458
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:50,726
And I don't want to be the only girl,

459
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:54,451
so please Haidee don't leave me alone.

460
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:55,751
She needs someone to keep her safe.

461
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,165
Especially with these two idiots.

462
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,729
- Oh, come on.
- Oh shit.

463
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,278
You girls won't be the
only girls out there.

464
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,112
There'll be a couple more.

465
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:01,945
They just called you out.

466
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:02,980
Yeah, your skanks don't count.

467
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:04,710
- We're classy.
- Oh shit.

468
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:05,558
Hey, hear that?

469
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:08,306
We lower our standards for reasons.

470
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,522
All right well,
just want to fucking go.

471
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,451
Let's do this, come on Griff.

472
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:19,157
- Let's go.
- Come on Griff.

473
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,687
- Alright.
- Let's go.

474
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:21,569
You'll be okay.

475
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,402
That's the spirit.

476
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:24,159
All right, hey,
so everyone just meet

477
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,691
at my house like around
5:30, we'll call it good?

478
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:27,525
Yeah.

479
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,358
All right, let's do this.

480
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,691
Let's go get something to eat.

481
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:47,012
Good
Afternoon, I'm Detective Hoffee

482
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:50,245
with the Lawford County
Sheriff's Department.

483
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:52,932
Can you please state
your name for the record?

484
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,183
Tanner Lewis.

485
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:56,055
Okay Mr. Lewis,

486
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,547
do you know why you're here?

487
00:19:58,548 --> 00:19:59,548
No.

488
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:03,679
We've obtained video evidence

489
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,272
of you, Mr. Lewis speaking
with a Jed Groves,

490
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:11,856
Gavin Landers, Tyler Brian,
Griffin Potts, Andrea Mills

491
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:16,415
and a Haidee Summers, three days ago

492
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,982
at the scene of a multiple murder.

493
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,650
What can you tell me about that?

494
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:27,503
They were my friends
and I just talked to 'em.

495
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:30,862
I talked to my friends.

496
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:31,938
And what was the conversation

497
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,522
you had with them in the video?

498
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,965
They asked me what happened.

499
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:40,633
So I just told them the
family was murdered.

500
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:44,148
And then I told 'em it was, you know...

501
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:45,163
it kind of reminded me of the story

502
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:48,324
that happened in the
same place 15 years ago.

503
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:52,363
And what's the story?

504
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:54,203
It's just from what I heard,

505
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:56,954
but the guy who lived there, Tom.

506
00:20:58,644 --> 00:20:59,793
His name was Tom,

507
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:04,591
And he found out that his
wife was cheating on him,

508
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:06,803
so he went crazy.

509
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:10,803
He put the kids and the
wife in the basement

510
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,905
and burnt them all alive.

511
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,719
The fire department says that
they found the whole family

512
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,388
in the basement burned alive.

513
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:21,556
But the story is that they
never found Tom's body.

514
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:26,963
Is that
all you talked to them about?

515
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,669
Well, I told them...

516
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,218
Yeah, that's what I said.

517
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:33,218
The family who bought it died,

518
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:34,398
and then I told them the story.

519
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:38,066
Where did you go after...

520
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:41,734
Where did they go after
you spoke with them?

521
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:43,652
I don't really know.

522
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:46,235
I think they just went camping?

523
00:21:47,134 --> 00:21:47,967
Where did you go

524
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:50,134
after you spoke with them?

525
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:52,758
I went home.

526
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,486
Okay, Mr. Lewis, we've got

527
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,756
a family of five murdered,
six other persons missing,

528
00:21:57,757 --> 00:22:01,840
an abandoned camp site,
a missing police officer,

529
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,799
and a three-story house that
looks like a butcher shop.

530
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,550
We need some answers.

531
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:10,516
I don't know what you're talking about.

532
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,065
I didn't know they were missing.

533
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:14,891
I just thought they
were there for that day.

534
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:15,731
They went camping.

535
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:17,004
I didn't know they're missing.

536
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:21,672
You're
the last person to see them.

537
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:29,757
Look, I told you everything I know.

538
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,308
Can I just go home?

539
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,920
I've been here for three hours.

540
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:40,360
I told you everything I know, I just...

541
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:44,444
Look, I just wanna go
home, I just wanna go home.

542
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,103
I don't know.

543
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:50,354
I don't know anything else.

544
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:01,178
You seriously have that
thing on everywhere we go.

545
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,539
I mean, we're in a car,
do you have to have it on?

546
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,574
Andrea, Andrea, just stop it-

547
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,642
- She's right Jed, you've
had that thing on all day.

548
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:08,706
Pretty soon it's going to
be attached to your body.

549
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:10,666
Get off me, Tyler.

550
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,707
There's nothing wrong with this.

551
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,597
I don't see what you guys are getting

552
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:14,135
all bent out of shape about.

553
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:15,087
It's annoying.

554
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:17,856
No, but when we get out at
the campsite, you better help.

555
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:19,686
None of this shit like last time.

556
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:21,926
I fucking helped last time.

557
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:22,760
Listen Jed-

558
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:24,436
- I'm tired of you guys
always saying I don't help.

559
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,586
I always fucking help.

560
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:28,356
And besides, you know,
Griffin's gonna have

561
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:29,190
his camera out there too.

562
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,274
So you can bitch at him
all you want, alright?

563
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,108
Good, so we're gonna have

564
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:33,586
two worthless motherfuckers out there

565
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,452
Oh my God.

566
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:38,104
Hey, turn that up.

567
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:39,909
This just in from

568
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,523
the Lawford County Sheriff's
Department regarding

569
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:43,373
the horrific crime that
occurred last night,

570
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:44,478
the Sheriff's department has stated

571
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:46,228
the deaths have been ruled as a homicide,

572
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:48,026
with no suspects at this time.

573
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,287
Anyone with information needs to call

574
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:51,353
the Lawford County Sheriff's Department.

575
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,804
Now back to the newest thing
here on 95.9 The Raven.

576
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,907
Oh my God.

577
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:06,637
If Griffin heard that he's
gonna be freaking out.

578
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:08,266
- You know it, dude.
- Hell yeah.

579
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,650
I just hope he-

580
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,436
- It's fucking Griffin.

581
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:18,699
Are you serious?

582
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,481
- Hello?
- Oh fuck.

583
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:24,247
Yeah, yeah man we heard it.

584
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:25,978
Are you kidding me?

585
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:30,963
No, there is no killer hiding
out in the woods, Griffin.

586
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:33,429
Hey, tell Griffin to tell
Haidee that she can't leave me.

587
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,366
You need to just stop
being a pussy, alright?

588
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:36,267
Tell him.

589
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,590
Haidee, you can't leave me.

590
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:40,345
Hey, Andrea says that Haidee
can't leave her out here.

591
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,721
Thank you.

592
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:44,024
If you come out there
and you get the sudden urge

593
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,278
to leave, that's fine you can leave.

594
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,845
But you at least have
to help us set up camp.

595
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:49,695
I mean, I really don't wanna have

596
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,984
to unload this thing.

597
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:51,985
We're already on our way,

598
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:52,819
you have to help us set up camp.

599
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,953
- You ain't gonna help anyway.
- Fuck you.

600
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:57,202
Yeah, all right, thanks bye.

601
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:58,361
Are they still coming?

602
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:00,942
- Yes.
- Thank God.

603
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:01,776
I'm surprised.

604
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:04,146
I figured he'd just wanna go back home.

605
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:05,895
He needs to stay out there.

606
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,629
I mean, I have never met a guy

607
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,034
that has been so scared so easily before.

608
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:10,868
Yeah, me neither.

609
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:11,701
It's kind of embarrassing.

610
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,936
You seriously still
have that thing on, Jed?

611
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:14,895
What's the big deal?

612
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:17,106
There's nothing wrong.

613
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:17,984
You guys always get pissed off

614
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,475
about the littlest stupid shit.

615
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,170
I don't understand it.

616
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:22,684
You have it on all the time.

617
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:25,661
I just got this, you know I did.

618
00:25:25,662 --> 00:25:26,825
Just lay the fuck off.

619
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:27,871
I mean, it's no different than him.

620
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:30,416
Look at him, he's up here
on his phone all the time.

621
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,998
What are you doing, huh?

622
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:34,435
Man, I'm trying to get
Gavin and I hooked up.

623
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:36,037
I'm actually doing
something productive, okay?

624
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:39,495
- Oh, productive my ass.
- Oh my God.

625
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,803
So how's that goin'?

626
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:41,922
I think you're
gonna be real happy

627
00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:44,034
with the treats I'm
getting out there tonight.

628
00:25:44,035 --> 00:25:46,260
Ew, that's disgusting.

629
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:49,160
Yeah, real happy.

630
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:52,140
Seriously Jed,
turn that damn thing off.

631
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:53,650
- Jesus Christ.
- Get off me, man.

632
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:58,401
This is fucking bullshit, you
guys always get pissed off-

633
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:08,565
- Yeah, we'll be all right, we good.

634
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,833
- But seriously...
- What?

635
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,067
Seriously, Jed?

636
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:11,901
What?

637
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:12,734
You started this shit already?

638
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:13,734
Dude, I got plenty of
battery to last us all night.

639
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:15,063
Turn that fucking thing off.

640
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,511
I'm not sure if that's
what he meant, douche bag.

641
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:17,946
I think it is,
so don't worry about-

642
00:26:17,947 --> 00:26:18,780
- What's up, man?

643
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,483
- We're the last ones.
- Fuck.

644
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:22,926
- How you doing?
- I'm alright now.

645
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:24,471
Think that guy's probably long gone.

646
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:26,020
- So you're good to go?
- Yeah, we good.

647
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:28,194
I wouldn't worry
about it Griff, okay.

648
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,454
You know what would be great?

649
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,004
If we'd start setting up
the fire and the tents,

650
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,586
because it's going to be dark soon.

651
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:34,467
Well the good news is
you've got the fire king here.

652
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,546
Okay fire king, go do your job.

653
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:37,057
Hey, Andrea,
it'll be alright babe.

654
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:37,891
We'll get it.

655
00:26:37,892 --> 00:26:39,637
Get the camera outta my face.

656
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:40,651
I agree.

657
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:41,603
Let's start getting this thing unloaded.

658
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:43,902
Hey Griff, you
brought your camera, right?

659
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,124
Yeah, it's in the car.

660
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,323
It's like half battery though.

661
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:47,157
Okay, that's fine.

662
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:49,183
I just wanted to make sure you brought it.

663
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,245
So I heard you talking
to Gavin, you doing okay?

664
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:52,896
Yeah, I think I'm fine right now.

665
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:54,209
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.

666
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,650
They said like, I mean, you know...

667
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,679
That guy's probably
long gone, so you know,

668
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,988
we're out here in the middle of nowhere.

669
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:00,577
No one's gonna touch us.

670
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,872
I wouldn't worry about it.

671
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:03,360
So let's just get this thing unloaded.

672
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:04,911
You guys need some help?

673
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,869
Are you guys done yet?

674
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,711
Hurry up.

675
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,723
Look at these lazy asses.

676
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:14,466
What the fuck do you mean hurry up?

677
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,396
I'm not a lazy ass,

678
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:17,295
I just don't know how to set up a tent.

679
00:27:17,296 --> 00:27:19,265
You brought
chairs for yourselves.

680
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:20,885
Duh.

681
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:21,719
You can sit there.

682
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,802
Yeah, probably for
this motherfucker here.

683
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,069
- What are you-
- What are you doing?

684
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,540
I'm just messing
with the camera, I'll be-

685
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,860
- Yeah you are.

686
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,661
Dude, it'll be okay.

687
00:27:29,662 --> 00:27:30,591
It'll only take a...

688
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:31,831
I mean, I'll set it down, okay?

689
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:33,079
Here, I'll help you.

690
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,257
What, you gonna help with one hand

691
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:35,521
and fuckin' record with the other?

692
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:36,355
We're not talking

693
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:37,381
about fucking pleasuring your girlfriend.

694
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:38,265
We're talking about setting up camp.

695
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:40,281
Dude, fuck you, don't bring Andrea

696
00:27:40,282 --> 00:27:42,913
into this, you fucking dick.

697
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:43,747
Oh my God, fuck you guys.

698
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:44,816
You guys are fucking assholes.

699
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:46,116
Whatever man, just start helping us.

700
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,516
Just set up
the tent, guys, God.

701
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,823
- It's not that hard.
- Oh, Jesus.

702
00:27:49,824 --> 00:27:50,657
Here, here, take-

703
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:51,495
- You're grabbing the wrong one.

704
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:53,292
Grab the right shit if
you're gonna help us.

705
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,126
Dude, no.

706
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,908
We set this shit up every fucking time.

707
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:56,806
Whatever, the last time we went-

708
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,360
- All you guys
have been doing is complain.

709
00:27:58,361 --> 00:27:59,194
The whole time we-

710
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:01,919
- You know what, this is bullshit.

711
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,411
You guys wanna relax?

712
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:04,438
- You wanna relax?
- Yeah, we do.

713
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:06,002
Let's relax, here.

714
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:08,319
How about you put your
feet up, you like that?

715
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,662
- Get the fuck back.
- Dude.

716
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:11,496
You little bitch.

717
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:12,329
Hey, hey, stop.

718
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,785
No, wait, no,
wait, wait guys, come on.

719
00:28:14,786 --> 00:28:15,619
Stop fucking, come on.

720
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,233
This is seriously bullshit.

721
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,863
You can sit in your fucking chair,

722
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,704
you put your feet up, you video tape.

723
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:21,634
You know what we're gonna do?

724
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:22,883
We're going to go get a fucking beer.

725
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:25,833
Alright, when you
get back you can set it up.

726
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:26,667
All right.

727
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,500
It better be set up
by the time we get back.

728
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,011
Cause, you know what, I'm
gonna be so fucking drunk,

729
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,236
I'll sleep on the ground, motherfucker.

730
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,519
- What's new?
- Good.

731
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,516
- What's new?
- Whatever.

732
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:35,576
You guys set it up if you wanna camp.

733
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:39,281
Hope you got some good
footage, douche bag.

734
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,115
Alright let's just hurry up

735
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,387
and get this fuckin' shit set up.

736
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,221
Alright, you can do it.

737
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:50,331
It's nice to actually get

738
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:51,619
some alone time with you.

739
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,372
Yeah, it's a good
thing Tyler and Gavin left.

740
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,371
They were getting annoying, quick.

741
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:58,471
Yeah, something like that.

742
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:01,139
Hey, I really wanted to apologize

743
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,640
for being such a bitch lately.

744
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:05,954
It's okay.

745
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:07,634
They always bring out the worst in you.

746
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:09,069
I know what to expect.

747
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,941
And they have to go everywhere

748
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:13,927
with us all the time
and it just bothers me.

749
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:15,521
It's not my choice.

750
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:17,076
You invite them.

751
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:20,987
They tag along,
it's completely different.

752
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:24,472
Right, right, whatever you say.

753
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,758
Well hey, we're alone now so...

754
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,592
Yeah, finally.

755
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:28,425
I mean, Griffin

756
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:31,496
and Haidee back there, doing whatever.

757
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:34,665
I don't even wanna know.

758
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,727
You always have that camera on.

759
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:37,515
Hey, what-

760
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:40,044
- Come on, superstar.

761
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,821
You're always filming everyone else.

762
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,655
Yeah, well...

763
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,405
Come on, do something.

764
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,229
- Okay, come here.
- Don't...

765
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,354
Maybe we should head back, come on.

766
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:52,741
No come on, let's walk
up a little further.

767
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:55,211
Come on, let's walk up a little further.

768
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,360
Griffin's not ready to
come out just yet, for sure.

769
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:59,487
It's okay, come on.

770
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:00,488
Come here.

771
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:03,521
He's probably freaking out.

772
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:06,292
He probably thinks we've
been killed or something.

773
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:08,164
By this hobo.

774
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:10,144
Don't say killed
too loud, he'll hear you.

775
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:12,929
In broad
daylight, he's gonna come out

776
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,430
with an ax, and then kill us or something?

777
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,019
I don't know what the
hell's taking him so long.

778
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,819
I saw him pull up, I thought...

779
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,653
Maybe I was wrong.

780
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:30,759
They're probably
getting the beer out, man.

781
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,424
I think they went to get
alcohol, didn't they?

782
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:33,898
They're always getting drunk.

783
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,312
Yeah, knowing those guys

784
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:36,849
they'll both be carrying up that cooler.

785
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,179
It'll be too heavy for 'em,
they'll have so much beer in it.

786
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,507
Yeah, it's just getting late.

787
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,329
Oh man, at least
we got a good fire going.

788
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:46,513
Yeah baby, drinks all around guys.

789
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:50,484
You guys need to quit being
some pussies and drink up.

790
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:51,318
Who wants a beer?

791
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,366
- You wanna beer?
- Oh yeah-

792
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:56,418
- He wants a beer, how
about you, and you, and you?

793
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:57,432
Yeah, I'll take one.

794
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:58,833
There's another one, right there.

795
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:04,359
I knew I couldn't trust
you guys giving me a beer.

796
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,641
Dude, you're so fucking easy.

797
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:06,475
You got it all the fuck over me, man.

798
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:07,520
I tell you what man, this is already

799
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:09,011
a good night for pranking.

800
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:09,907
Oh my God.

801
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:11,500
This is just getting started, Tyler.

802
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:15,029
Hey, hey Griff,
better you than me, buddy.

803
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,861
You guys need
to seriously grow up.

804
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:17,862
So pathetic.

805
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,045
I can't even stand
to be around you guys.

806
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,649
I'm gonna go get my cell phone.

807
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,500
Haidee, will you go with me?

808
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,333
Yeah I'll come with you.

809
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,166
Alright, thanks for the beer, man.

810
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:24,999
I got an idea, why don't

811
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,159
you girls fucking hold hands when you go?

812
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,413
Don't worry, we will.

813
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:29,414
Well bye.

814
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:33,169
So, hey Tyler?

815
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,003
Yo?

816
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:36,162
I been meaning to ask you this.

817
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:39,736
So these girls that
are coming out tonight,

818
00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:40,956
they're better than the last time, right?

819
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:43,344
Dude, what the hell
was wrong with last time?

820
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:44,962
Are you serious?

821
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,959
Hey Gavin, how about them girls last time?

822
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,600
You're talking about
Ginny and Bethany, right?

823
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:50,483
I assume that's who's.

824
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:51,611
Yeah, that's
who I'm talking about.

825
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:52,875
You're only talking' about
girls cause Andrea left, Jed.

826
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,943
Hey Griffin, stay out of this.

827
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:57,714
Seriously Tyler, I'm sorry.

828
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,367
But I really don't wanna talk about

829
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:02,494
the girls from last time.

830
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:04,447
What was wrong with
the girls from last time?

831
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:05,370
Dude seriously, okay.

832
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:07,027
You take the bottom of the barrel,

833
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:09,167
and then you knock out
the bottom, alright?

834
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:10,001
Really?

835
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:11,862
Dude, all right I'm not
saying bottom of the barrel

836
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,428
or anything because I've been
at the bottom of the barrel.

837
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:17,592
But, I did have to change
my cell phone number.

838
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:18,845
Okay, okay, listen.

839
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,677
No dude I'm
telling you these girls...

840
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:22,179
Okay, you had to drink 20 beers

841
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,297
for them to look decent, alright?

842
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:25,564
And you know what we do?

843
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,462
We drink 21 beers.

844
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,517
That's right, yes.

845
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:31,437
- Listen, alright.
- Anything that walks.

846
00:32:31,438 --> 00:32:32,271
Exactly.

847
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:34,076
Those girls were a
little psycho, I admit.

848
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:34,910
But here's how I live my life.

849
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,052
Oh, oh, just a little, huh?

850
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:40,272
Sometimes you gotta fish,
and you fish in that barrel.

851
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:43,562
And sometimes you might catch
the bottom of the barrel,

852
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:45,507
and that pisses you off, but it's okay,

853
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:48,264
because one day you're gonna
catch the top of the barrel.

854
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,467
And these girls are the top
of the barrel, guaranteed.

855
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,005
He is drunk, drunk, drunk.

856
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,288
Hey, have you guys been drinking?

857
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:55,673
- Hell yeah, we have.
- A lot.

858
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,788
What if the biggest fish
is at the top of the barrel?

859
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,623
Then we're gonna fuck that big fish.

860
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,370
It's a big barrel.

861
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:04,151
It's a big barrel.

862
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:05,950
You guys drank way too
much on the way here.

863
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:06,784
You're lucky you didn't get caught.

864
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,185
So where are those girls at?

865
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,241
Dude, they're on their way.

866
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:10,408
They're at work right now,
they'll be here in a hour.

867
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:13,823
Yeah, they don't exist.

868
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:14,974
Don't you be talking shit

869
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:17,604
because you know about
your girlfriend, Jed.

870
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:19,315
What the fuck do you mean by that?

871
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:21,573
Like she ever fucking has to work.

872
00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:22,407
Dude, what-

873
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:23,645
- You know the only reason she's with you

874
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:24,674
is because of your fucking parents.

875
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:25,927
Dude, don't talk shit, all right?

876
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:27,115
It ain't even cool.

877
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:28,279
Are you telling secrets?

878
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,361
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

879
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:31,244
You guys shoulda heard
what we heard on the radio.

880
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,089
What's that?

881
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,986
What Andrea, another fuckin' murder?

882
00:33:33,987 --> 00:33:36,405
Why are you always such a jackass?

883
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:38,737
They said they have a suspect,
he's in custody right now.

884
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:43,116
Supposed to be some hobo,
walking this side of town.

885
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,392
Hey Griff,
does that make you feel

886
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:45,667
a little bit better?

887
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:46,710
Well, if he's in custody I-

888
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:48,591
- Boogeyman's not
gonna get you tonight.

889
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,180
No boogieman.

890
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:59,046
So Tyler, back to what
we were talking about...

891
00:33:59,047 --> 00:33:59,877
About the girls.

892
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:02,608
I'm done talking about these girls.

893
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,441
Are you that ashamed of them?

894
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,890
You have to judge when you see them.

895
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,462
Oh okay, I'll judge.

896
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:07,294
Andrea, are you gonna
let him talk about girls?

897
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:08,271
Dude, when are they coming?

898
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:09,310
It is on, alright?

899
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:11,690
They will be here in an hour, it is on.

900
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,010
These girls are gonna be here.

901
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,751
I'll bet they have STDs.

902
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:15,870
Are they classy?

903
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:17,171
- Ask Gavin.
- They're way classy.

904
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:19,985
You girls, don't put that
fucking voodoo on us, alright?

905
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,128
That voodoo
was already put on you

906
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:23,387
the last time you guys brought out girls.

907
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:25,371
Man whatever, you know what,

908
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:27,188
I'm done talking about this subject.

909
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:29,772
Subject changed now, seriously.

910
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:34,563
Hey, I've got a good subject change.

911
00:34:34,564 --> 00:34:36,963
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

912
00:34:36,964 --> 00:34:38,213
They said they found the killer.

913
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:40,021
Let's go check that house out.

914
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:41,103
You're crazy.

915
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:42,743
I think it sounds like a good idea.

916
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:43,647
Gavin, are you serious?

917
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,563
Yeah Jed, let's go check it out.

918
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,133
Why would we check it out?

919
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:49,624
Fuck no.

920
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,488
What's the purpose of it?

921
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,307
We saw it today.

922
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,088
Dude, think about it.

923
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:54,922
I'm thinking about it.

924
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:55,755
I'm thinking it's pretty fucking dumb.

925
00:34:55,756 --> 00:34:59,873
A fuckin' murder that happened
in this fuckin' small town,

926
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:02,225
a little over a mile from here.

927
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,059
So?

928
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,920
You talk about your fucking
ghost stories and something,

929
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:06,336
this is a real life ghost story, man.

930
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,393
Dude, fuck no, man.

931
00:35:08,394 --> 00:35:10,177
Seriously, I came out here,

932
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:11,447
I'm not going back to that house.

933
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:13,827
Hey whoa, you know what man?

934
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:16,988
Listen, alright, you
have our word, all right?

935
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,572
It's gonna be okay.

936
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:20,775
Hey Andrea, what do you think?

937
00:35:20,776 --> 00:35:23,171
It does sound kinda fun.

938
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:25,463
- Come on, Jed.
- Seriously?

939
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:28,944
Okay, if I go
I'll go on one condition.

940
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:30,209
That's I bring my camera

941
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,256
and you can't say a fucking word about it.

942
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:33,524
Cause you been giving me shit all day.

943
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:34,838
I apologize for that.

944
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:35,672
I promise I won't say anything about it.

945
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:36,505
Oh, I apologize.

946
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:37,338
You can hate

947
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:41,128
your real life fuckin'
ghost story shit in there.

948
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:41,992
Because I got
you on record right now.

949
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:46,041
You'll have more fucking fun
looking for ghosts with us.

950
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,823
Fuck that shit, true, true.

951
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:49,576
Dude, you can fucking
stay here if you want.

952
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:50,939
You know what, you can
sleep in these tents

953
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,534
with the fucking rest of

954
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:54,494
the fucking hobos asleep out here tonight.

955
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,325
Oh you hear that?

956
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:58,084
Does that sound fun to you, Haidee?

957
00:35:58,085 --> 00:35:59,873
I think he's right
there, you can do that.

958
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,019
You know you guys are gonna do

959
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,420
something stupid, fuck
up and get us caught,

960
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:06,180
like you always do, they are.

961
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:07,853
- Nah man.
- Haidee, you wanna go?

962
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:09,889
Griff, this is serious
stuff dude, they won't do it.

963
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,650
No, Haidee, you wanna go?

964
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:12,922
I dunno, I kinda don't.

965
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:13,756
Really?

966
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,009
So Griffin, are you gonna listen to her

967
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,980
the rest of your fucking life?

968
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,454
I didn't wanna go either.

969
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:20,059
She doesn't wanna go, so
you're gonna listen to her

970
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,893
the rest of your fucking life?

971
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:21,991
That's two, not-wanna-goes then.

972
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:23,329
Doesn't matter.

973
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,730
Stop being a pussy, and
take initiative for once.

974
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:27,010
You gotta bring your camera, man.

975
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:30,480
Dude come on, I need another guy.

976
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,410
You guys promise me you're
not gonna do anything stupid

977
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:36,280
to get us caught, and I'll think about it.

978
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,540
You've got to think about it?

979
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:40,977
Promise?

980
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,471
- Yeah, fucking promise
- We promise, man.

981
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:43,543
Yeah.

982
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:45,766
- So let's do it.
- Let's do it.

983
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:46,600
- Alright, let's go.
- Let's fucking go.

984
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:47,831
Let's load up and go.

985
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:48,665
We're taking the beer, man.

986
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,527
Let's go, come
on, come on, let's go.

987
00:36:50,528 --> 00:36:51,794
Andrea, come on.

988
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,280
Let's go, come on.

989
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:54,737
I'm telling you...

990
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:55,992
This is a bad idea.

991
00:36:55,993 --> 00:36:57,397
This is fucking crazy.

992
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:00,953
Full moon tonight,
werewolves are out.

993
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,872
Where'd you guys park at?

994
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:04,170
We're down here somewhere.

995
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:05,004
Down here somewhere.

996
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:09,671
We weren't exactly
sober when we were driving.

997
00:37:12,884 --> 00:37:13,944
Man, I am so glad

998
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:16,385
we brought the alcohol for this trip.

999
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:17,219
You guys have a problem.

1000
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,824
I think every time we hang out
you guys are drunk, always.

1001
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:22,374
There's nothing wrong
with drinking, Andrea.

1002
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,497
No kidding, wait for
these girls to get out here.

1003
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:25,797
We'll show you what drinking is.

1004
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:26,981
Oh, so there'll be drunken
skanks hanging out with us?

1005
00:37:26,982 --> 00:37:28,209
Wait, wait, hang
on, hang on, wait, wait.

1006
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,465
Gavin, where are we going?

1007
00:37:30,466 --> 00:37:31,529
Shortcut.

1008
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,553
This is not a shortcut,
this is the wrong way.

1009
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:36,654
I agreed to go
to the house with you guys

1010
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:37,639
so take me to the house.

1011
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,765
You know what?

1012
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:41,358
Gavin, let's go back to the damn-

1013
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,314
- Yeah, you gotta turn around.

1014
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:43,164
Let's just go back.

1015
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:44,160
Gavin, if you're
gonna pull this shit,

1016
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,363
we're just gonna go back
to the campsite, alright?

1017
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,823
I'm tired of messing around, okay?

1018
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:49,127
Man, these guys are being such pussies.

1019
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:51,454
Tyler, lay the fuck off, okay?

1020
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:53,973
We did not agree to do this shit, okay?

1021
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:56,753
We should go
ahead and turn around.

1022
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:57,587
You know what I mean, turn around.

1023
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:58,928
That's not even
funny, that's not funny.

1024
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:00,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah funny.

1025
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:03,856
- What are you doing?
- Gavin...

1026
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:04,942
What the hell are you doing, dude?

1027
00:38:04,943 --> 00:38:05,993
Chinese fire drill.

1028
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:07,776
No, we're not
doing a Chinese fire drill.

1029
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:08,643
You guys...

1030
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:10,344
Griffin, you lose your glasses?

1031
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:11,178
Yeah, shit.

1032
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:12,147
They're right
there, fucking assholes.

1033
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:14,276
What the hell
are they doing out there?

1034
00:38:14,277 --> 00:38:17,337
Come on, bitch.

1035
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:19,914
Got the camera.

1036
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,804
Gimme my fucking
camera back, give it back.

1037
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,045
Give it back, okay?

1038
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:27,129
You keep pulling this shit.

1039
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,044
Got a text message.

1040
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,579
Gavin, give it back, now.

1041
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,413
Uh-oh, it's a picture message.

1042
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:31,313
I'm tired of this.

1043
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:32,289
- What Andrea?
- Check this out.

1044
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,230
Give him his camera back.

1045
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,064
Are you going to let her fight

1046
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:36,897
your battles for you, man?

1047
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,076
You know what
Gavin, fuck you, okay?

1048
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:39,811
- Check this out.
- Who's that?

1049
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:40,653
No, give me my motherfucking-

1050
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:41,779
- That's Stacey, man.

1051
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:46,632
Dude, fucking
stop, all right, dammit.

1052
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,516
Whatever man, why you
gotta be such a pussy?

1053
00:38:48,517 --> 00:38:50,092
Dude, I'm not
a fucking pussy, okay?

1054
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,292
You guys just need to
grow the fuck up, okay?

1055
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:53,665
I'm just tired of it, just stop, okay?

1056
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,679
What's that, shots on the hood?

1057
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,953
- Shots on the hood?
- Shots on the hood?

1058
00:38:56,954 --> 00:38:57,787
Shots on the hood.

1059
00:38:57,788 --> 00:39:00,446
No, we are not doing
shots on the hood, come on.

1060
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:02,997
Turn around.

1061
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:04,825
You're gonna get the
fuckin' cops called on us.

1062
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:05,659
Okay, come on.

1063
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,076
Jed, you will love it most.

1064
00:39:09,898 --> 00:39:11,162
Dude, I'm not fucking-

1065
00:39:11,163 --> 00:39:13,237
- How many, how many?
- No, stop.

1066
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:15,387
None, really, seriously?

1067
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:16,858
Just 'cause they're not taking them?

1068
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:17,914
Gavin, stop.

1069
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:21,059
You two used to be the most
fun people to hang out with.

1070
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,308
And then these two came along, what up?

1071
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:26,198
Those girls will be much
more fun than you two.

1072
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,688
Because they're nasty,

1073
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:29,391
Yes they are, they're awesome.

1074
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:31,146
Just because we're not playing

1075
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:33,240
your old fucking drinking games guys.

1076
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:34,074
Just get in the fucking car.

1077
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:35,484
Come on, stop-

1078
00:39:35,485 --> 00:39:36,318
- This is not fun.

1079
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:37,197
Come on Jed, shots on the hood.

1080
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:38,566
- No, we're not-
- Tradition, man.

1081
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:41,483
Traditions
change, people grow up.

1082
00:39:41,484 --> 00:39:42,723
Unlike you guys.

1083
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:43,586
Yeah well, we still
know how to have fun.

1084
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:45,683
Get back in the fucking car.

1085
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:46,695
Let's go back in the fucking car.

1086
00:39:46,696 --> 00:39:48,237
Let's go, come on.

1087
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:51,488
- So stupid.
- Hurry up.

1088
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:54,032
Okay, are we done?

1089
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:55,999
Can we go now?

1090
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,166
Road tripping?

1091
00:39:57,167 --> 00:40:00,140
Let's continue our road trip.

1092
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,042
You guys keep
pulling that shit, I'm not...

1093
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:07,113
Was that seriously
necessary, you guys?

1094
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,450
You wanna shut your fucking door?

1095
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:12,545
Well I'm locking, fucking...

1096
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,463
We're turning around.

1097
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:17,843
Of course it was necessary.

1098
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:19,976
Right.

1099
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:22,150
Taking shots on the hood's a tradition.

1100
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:23,240
No shit.

1101
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:24,590
We've done that every time we stopped,

1102
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,261
until you fucking girls came along.

1103
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:27,820
Yeah, now Jed's just a pussy.

1104
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:28,880
Gavin, that's beside the-

1105
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,023
Fuck you, Tyler.

1106
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:32,181
Hey Gavin, that's besides the point, okay?

1107
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:33,060
You've had way, way-

1108
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:34,559
Look at that, you even
turned on your window wipers.

1109
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,752
You've had way too much to drink tonight.

1110
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:38,491
You know we'll be okay.

1111
00:40:38,492 --> 00:40:39,325
Always are.

1112
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:40,590
Yeah well, one of these times

1113
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:42,551
is gonna bite you in the
fucking ass, all right?

1114
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:44,736
You guys probably won't even remember

1115
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:46,401
the girls that come over tonight.

1116
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,235
Guarantee we remember.

1117
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,236
As a good friend,

1118
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,420
here's something I'm
going to do for you, okay?

1119
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:53,356
When the girls come over,
I'll take pictures of them.

1120
00:40:53,357 --> 00:40:54,650
So when you wake up in the morning,

1121
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:56,701
you can realize how ugly they are.

1122
00:40:56,702 --> 00:41:01,193
All I'm gonna say is 10 and
two, that's it, 10 and two.

1123
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:03,978
What the hell's 10 and two?

1124
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:06,308
At 10 o'clock the girl looks like a two,

1125
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:08,688
but by two o'clock she looks like a 10.

1126
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:09,880
That's how all your girls are.

1127
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,714
That's like hitting the nail

1128
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:11,547
on the head right there.

1129
00:41:11,547 --> 00:41:12,486
Let me just inform you this.

1130
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:13,747
Okay, inform me.

1131
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:14,629
You got the camera on me?

1132
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,804
Yeah, the camera's rolling.

1133
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:17,962
These girls are way hotter than

1134
00:41:17,963 --> 00:41:20,494
any girl you've ever dated, Jed.

1135
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:22,651
No offense, Andrea.
Oh, whatever Tyler.

1136
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:25,781
Well, I'm pretty sure that every girl

1137
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:27,518
that you guys bring over will never be

1138
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,952
as hot as Haidee and I, fuck that.

1139
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:30,890
Yeah, we'll see about that.

1140
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,479
We will see.

1141
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:36,986
Oh look, guess who's calling.

1142
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:38,768
- Skanks.
- They're home already?

1143
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,746
I don't know, we'll find out.

1144
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:41,969
We have to go back early though.

1145
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,254
Thank God.

1146
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:45,588
Hello?

1147
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:47,847
Hey, what's up?

1148
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:51,028
You girls off work yet?

1149
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:52,298
Oh okay, you got another hour?

1150
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:55,029
Do you guys wanna place
bets on how ugly they are?

1151
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,159
They're pretty ugly, I can tell.

1152
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,989
You're lucky I promised
you could have that camera

1153
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,938
because that light's about to piss me off.

1154
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:01,759
You know what, fuck you Gavin.

1155
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,918
Hey Gavin by the way...

1156
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:05,251
Yeah, cause we
bought the whole store.

1157
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:06,963
Who says we bought anything?

1158
00:42:06,964 --> 00:42:07,797
That's wrong.

1159
00:42:07,798 --> 00:42:10,017
Hey Gavin, I
guarantee you that you guys

1160
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:11,925
will be passed out by
the time they get there.

1161
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:14,316
- Bullshit.
- I guarantee it.

1162
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:15,571
We're in it for the long haul.

1163
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:17,887
Oh long haul, yeah.

1164
00:42:17,888 --> 00:42:22,723
Just cause you have all
the alcohol doesn't mean-

1165
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:25,429
- Well, I guess when
they come out I'll believe it.

1166
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,620
But I doubt they'll make it out there.

1167
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:27,890
Because you guys will be...

1168
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:29,004
Your phones will be blowing up

1169
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,263
all night long like, hey,
where are you guys at?

1170
00:42:31,264 --> 00:42:32,811
Are you guys gonna take-

1171
00:42:32,812 --> 00:42:36,165
You're gonna be passed out in the tent.

1172
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,813
I just wanna know if the
girls are going to show up

1173
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:40,744
in like hooker heels and mini skirts.

1174
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:43,981
- We only hope.
- We hope so.

1175
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:44,841
Wow.

1176
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,820
That's exactly
why we call them skanks.

1177
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:47,654
Yes.

1178
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:49,639
They're not
skanks, they're classy.

1179
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,619
Classy ladies.

1180
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,887
I'd like to say, if
you can't get it easy

1181
00:42:52,888 --> 00:42:54,169
then get it sleazy.

1182
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,124
That's disgusting.

1183
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,058
Okay Tyler, where do
you even meet these girls?

1184
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:00,338
I'm just curious, do you find them online?

1185
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:01,881
I wouldn't meet them online.

1186
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:02,978
Oh, whatever.

1187
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:05,188
- Dude.
- What?

1188
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:07,673
Met them randomly at
this bar I was at, you know?

1189
00:43:07,674 --> 00:43:08,952
Hey Gavin.

1190
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,786
Where are you going?

1191
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,854
Gavin, we are not doing
this again, are you serious?

1192
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,355
Gavin.

1193
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:35,601
You two want
to come in and have a seat?

1194
00:43:35,602 --> 00:43:36,852
Okay.

1195
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,883
Do you know how long this is gonna be?

1196
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:45,801
The detective
will be in shortly.

1197
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,881
I hope this doesn't take all day.

1198
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:51,161
I don't even know why I'm here.

1199
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,245
It's not like I met them.

1200
00:43:55,137 --> 00:43:56,411
Hello, Detective Hoffee

1201
00:43:56,412 --> 00:43:58,769
with Lawford County Sheriff's Department.

1202
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,450
Okay, please state your
name for the record.

1203
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:02,684
Stacey Hill.

1204
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:03,923
Nikki Allen.

1205
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:04,757
Thank you, so-

1206
00:44:04,758 --> 00:44:05,850
- So why are we even here?

1207
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,991
I'm sure you're both aware

1208
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:08,123
why you're here.

1209
00:44:08,124 --> 00:44:09,154
Not really.

1210
00:44:09,155 --> 00:44:10,572
Nikki, shut up.

1211
00:44:13,756 --> 00:44:14,744
Both of
you are persons of interest

1212
00:44:14,745 --> 00:44:16,415
in the disappearance of Tyler Brian,

1213
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:19,408
Gavin Landers, amongst some others.

1214
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,932
Look, I've never even met them before.

1215
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:23,423
Stacey set this whole thing up.

1216
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:25,091
Nikki please stop.

1217
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:27,280
According to the text message

1218
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:29,705
and phone records, it shows
you both were supposed

1219
00:44:29,706 --> 00:44:32,481
to meet them after you got off work.

1220
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,362
This makes you the last
people to hear from them.

1221
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:37,729
Can you tell me what time
you last spoke with them?

1222
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,727
I talked to Tyler on
the phone around 9:30.

1223
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:43,164
Yeah, on the 23rd.

1224
00:44:43,165 --> 00:44:44,747
And like I said, I've never
even talked to them before.

1225
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,162
Ms. Allen, just calm down.

1226
00:44:47,163 --> 00:44:48,067
Thank you, Ms. Hill.

1227
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:49,342
Can you tell me what was the nature

1228
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:52,381
of the conversation you had with Tyler?

1229
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:54,558
We talked about when
we were getting off work

1230
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,944
and where we were going to meet.

1231
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:57,778
Did they say anything

1232
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,532
about having you meet
them at the murder house?

1233
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,143
No, nothing like that.

1234
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:04,494
We didn't even know they were going there.

1235
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:06,193
After I talked to Tyler on my break,

1236
00:45:06,194 --> 00:45:08,093
I never heard back from him.

1237
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:09,325
What
made you go to the campsite

1238
00:45:09,326 --> 00:45:11,303
when you heard nothing back?

1239
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:12,956
They sent us directions earlier.

1240
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:15,835
So we decided to go anyway.

1241
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:19,569
Figured his phone had
died or lost service.

1242
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,755
What
did you see when you arrived?

1243
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,067
Well, they basically stood us up

1244
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:25,551
and they left the campfire going.

1245
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:27,074
Who even does that?

1246
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:28,461
Okay, besides the campfire

1247
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:31,246
was anything else out of the ordinary?

1248
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:34,826
There was a car, but no one was around.

1249
00:45:34,827 --> 00:45:36,620
How long did you stay?

1250
00:45:36,621 --> 00:45:37,856
About 30 minutes.

1251
00:45:37,857 --> 00:45:42,242
We left when no one showed
and we did put the fire out.

1252
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:43,076
And after you left,

1253
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:45,717
did you hear from Tyler?

1254
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:47,885
Like I said, not a word.

1255
00:45:49,006 --> 00:45:49,839
Where did you go

1256
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,915
after you left the campsite?

1257
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,226
Well, I made her take me home

1258
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,604
after that waste of a night.

1259
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:57,105
This is the last time
I let you talk me into

1260
00:45:57,106 --> 00:45:58,481
that stupid blind date shit again.

1261
00:45:58,482 --> 00:45:59,514
Will you please just shut up?

1262
00:45:59,515 --> 00:46:00,348
I shouldn't even be here.

1263
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:02,015
I should be at home right
now I'm here because of you.

1264
00:46:02,016 --> 00:46:03,116
You didn't have to go.

1265
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:03,950
This is the last time

1266
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:04,783
I let you talk me into this crappy game.

1267
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:05,886
Okay, okay, okay.

1268
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:07,185
Let's just pause for a second.

1269
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:09,650
Okay now Nikki I know you say
you never met Tyler or Gavin,

1270
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:13,818
but what was your relationship
with Thomas Colton?

1271
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:19,751
I'm not answering any more questions.

1272
00:46:19,752 --> 00:46:21,335
I'd like my lawyer.

1273
00:46:29,357 --> 00:46:30,991
Gavin, dude, where they
hell are you taking us man?

1274
00:46:30,992 --> 00:46:32,256
This is not the right road.

1275
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:33,090
You'll see.

1276
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,341
This is some bullshit.

1277
00:46:34,342 --> 00:46:35,342
Chill out.

1278
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:37,630
Seriously, you
guys need to calm down

1279
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,700
because you are gonna like this.

1280
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:41,084
- Tyler.
- Right.

1281
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:41,958
And guess what?

1282
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:45,384
If you don't like it,
y'all can just walk home.

1283
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,163
Let me just tell you this,
I would not wanna walk home.

1284
00:46:48,164 --> 00:46:49,431
Not out here.

1285
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,894
I heard that man, not with
all those hillbilly buttfuckers

1286
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:53,325
that walk around, know what I'm saying?

1287
00:46:53,326 --> 00:46:54,434
Really, come on.

1288
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:56,657
Gavin, just pull
over so I can drive, alright?

1289
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:58,210
Hey, we're almost there.

1290
00:46:58,211 --> 00:46:59,044
We're almost where?

1291
00:46:59,044 --> 00:46:59,888
You're not even telling us anything.

1292
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:03,345
Just pull over I'll take us
back to the campsite, okay?

1293
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:07,179
Your girls are coming
anyway, so just pull over.

1294
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,013
Gavin.

1295
00:47:08,014 --> 00:47:09,056
Dude, we're really close.

1296
00:47:09,057 --> 00:47:10,919
I don't care if we're really close

1297
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,373
or really far away, just pull over, okay?

1298
00:47:13,374 --> 00:47:15,957
And quit drinking dammit, gosh.

1299
00:47:17,345 --> 00:47:18,178
Seriously.

1300
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:19,434
You guys need to grow up, okay?

1301
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:22,199
We're not in fucking high
school anymore, all right?

1302
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,207
You're not invincible.

1303
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,522
I liked the girls in high school.

1304
00:47:24,523 --> 00:47:26,594
Hey whoa, whoa,
whoa, okay, get out.

1305
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:27,573
We're here.

1306
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:28,697
- Where's here?
- This is not the house.

1307
00:47:28,698 --> 00:47:29,531
Why are we stopped

1308
00:47:29,532 --> 00:47:31,106
in the middle of bum fuck nowhere?

1309
00:47:31,107 --> 00:47:33,843
Well no shit,
Haidee, this is not the house.

1310
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:35,495
Tyler, what the fuck man?

1311
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:38,428
You're always all up on Haidee and me.

1312
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:40,498
What about Jed and Andrea?

1313
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:43,398
Hey, you know what, Griffin?

1314
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:45,090
Why don't you quit-

1315
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:48,393
- Not again, not this shit.

1316
00:47:48,394 --> 00:47:49,687
Stop, Tyler.

1317
00:47:49,688 --> 00:47:51,158
Fuck man, we're all friends here.

1318
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:51,992
Bullshit.

1319
00:47:51,992 --> 00:47:52,962
Gavin, let's just go, okay.

1320
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:54,154
I'm tired of dealing
with this shit tonight.

1321
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:56,322
No, we've got something to do here.

1322
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:57,156
What do we have to do?

1323
00:47:57,157 --> 00:47:58,353
Where are we even at?

1324
00:47:58,354 --> 00:48:00,095
We gotta check out
Thomas Colton's grave.

1325
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:00,929
You've gotta be kidding me.

1326
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,331
Who the hell is Thomas Colton?

1327
00:48:02,332 --> 00:48:03,298
You don't remember?

1328
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:04,497
Seriously, man.

1329
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:08,415
The douchebag at the house
that told us about the guy.

1330
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,249
You mean Tanner?

1331
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,020
Yeah, whatever his name is.

1332
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:13,483
You mean the story
about the whole fucking-

1333
00:48:13,484 --> 00:48:15,783
- That's disgusting.

1334
00:48:15,784 --> 00:48:16,617
Oh my God.

1335
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:17,450
You mean the whole story about

1336
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:18,713
the people in the basement being burnt?

1337
00:48:18,714 --> 00:48:20,131
Yeah, that one.

1338
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,070
How do you know this
is even the right graveyard?

1339
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:23,924
We were in the house earlier

1340
00:48:23,925 --> 00:48:25,435
and Tyler and I did some asking around

1341
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,880
and found out that the
person that owned it before,

1342
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:30,798
Mr. Thomas Colton, AKA Tanner's Tom

1343
00:48:33,031 --> 00:48:33,933
is buried right here in this cemetery.

1344
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:36,387
Yeah, but you guys were
saying the story's bullshit.

1345
00:48:36,388 --> 00:48:37,258
We're about to go find out.

1346
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:38,317
We're about to go find out if he's here.

1347
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:40,432
No, let's just go.

1348
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:41,498
Let's go back to the campsite.

1349
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:43,382
You know I was all for going

1350
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:45,008
and seeing the house, checking it out,

1351
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,868
but I am not going out into the graveyard

1352
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:48,120
in the middle of the night.

1353
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:49,666
That's where I draw the line.

1354
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:50,826
Would you rather sit
in a car in a graveyard

1355
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,211
in the middle of the night?

1356
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:53,045
'Cause, we're taking the keys.

1357
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:54,942
No man, no.

1358
00:48:57,031 --> 00:48:57,864
Don't fuck with me.

1359
00:48:57,865 --> 00:48:59,511
Dude, gimme the keys back.

1360
00:48:59,512 --> 00:49:01,426
- Get back in the car.
- I wanna go back.

1361
00:49:01,427 --> 00:49:02,428
Hey, you know what?

1362
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:04,154
The only way we're gonna
be leaving right now

1363
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:05,616
is if one of you guys go with us.

1364
00:49:05,617 --> 00:49:06,450
Who's it gonna be?

1365
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,283
- I'm not going.
- I'm not going either.

1366
00:49:07,284 --> 00:49:08,851
Gavin, get in this car, now.

1367
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:11,630
Let's go, one
person, go with us, come on.

1368
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,039
You guys can make that decision.

1369
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,892
Gavin, come on.

1370
00:49:14,893 --> 00:49:16,168
Jed, you're gonna have to go.

1371
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:18,238
- Just go.
- Please?

1372
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,030
The sooner you go and do
whatever they wanna do-

1373
00:49:21,031 --> 00:49:21,864
- Fine.

1374
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:24,482
The sooner we get to leave.

1375
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:27,650
Come on guys, this isn't cool.

1376
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:30,803
Gavin, Tyler, come on guys.

1377
00:49:33,736 --> 00:49:34,736
Oh man.

1378
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:39,256
Did you guys seriously go in the cemetery?

1379
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,428
Gavin, Tyler, come on guys.

1380
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:46,569
This isn't cool.

1381
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,651
Oh, man.

1382
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:55,027
Guys, I'm seriously-

1383
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:56,611
I just wanna leave.

1384
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:00,086
Oh, man.

1385
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:01,087
Guys?

1386
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:05,970
Come on dude, I don't wanna
be in a graveyard after hours

1387
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:06,849
and us get caught, okay?

1388
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,123
'Cause we'll be in so much, I mean...

1389
00:50:09,124 --> 00:50:10,690
This could be bad.

1390
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:12,608
Let's just go, come on.

1391
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:15,031
Guys?

1392
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,522
Dude, this isn't even cool guys.

1393
00:50:18,523 --> 00:50:21,802
I would never do anything
like this to you, come on.

1394
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,762
Come on, come on.

1395
00:50:26,763 --> 00:50:27,763
Guys?

1396
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:33,537
I'm gonna count to three, okay?

1397
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:34,538
One.

1398
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:36,536
Two.

1399
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:38,409
Hey.

1400
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,930
I'll make you wish you were dead, boy.

1401
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,736
Gavin

1402
00:50:43,737 --> 00:50:45,453
Like a little
colt on the ground, man.

1403
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:46,847
Look at him.

1404
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:47,995
You alright Jed?

1405
00:50:47,996 --> 00:50:51,267
No dude, that's
not even cool, alright?

1406
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:52,537
Let's just go, okay?

1407
00:50:52,538 --> 00:50:53,538
Let's go.

1408
00:50:55,396 --> 00:50:56,320
What's so funny?

1409
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,153
No, come on, dude.

1410
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,161
Let's go back to the car.

1411
00:50:58,162 --> 00:50:58,995
I'm tired of this, let's go.

1412
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:00,055
No man, we found something.

1413
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,325
You gotta check this out.

1414
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:02,735
No, what'd you find?

1415
00:51:02,736 --> 00:51:03,812
We found the grave.

1416
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:05,081
There's no way
you found it already.

1417
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:07,423
Let's go back to the car, come on.

1418
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:08,959
- No man, over here.
- Over here, man.

1419
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,525
Guys?

1420
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:11,834
Dude, I'm gonna go back, alright?

1421
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,182
Come on.

1422
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:14,413
Hey man, come check this out.

1423
00:51:14,414 --> 00:51:17,194
And then you can go back.

1424
00:51:17,195 --> 00:51:18,028
- What?
- What, man?

1425
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:19,848
No, no, no did
you guys just hear that?

1426
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:20,682
Hear what?

1427
00:51:20,683 --> 00:51:23,500
No seriously
dude, something happened.

1428
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:25,301
Dude, did you not just hear that?

1429
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:28,619
No.

1430
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,919
Dude, the thing
just came right at me.

1431
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,898
I don't know what it was.

1432
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:32,281
It just came right at me.

1433
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:33,908
There's nothing out here.

1434
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:35,094
No, there was something.

1435
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,142
Dude, just come take a look

1436
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,680
at this grave and stop being a pussy.

1437
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:39,631
Dude, my battery's dying.

1438
00:51:39,632 --> 00:51:40,650
I just wanna go back to the car.

1439
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:43,404
Well then hurry the heck up.

1440
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:45,255
What?

1441
00:51:49,617 --> 00:51:51,538
Some fucking camera
operator man you are.

1442
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:53,052
Can't even keep damn
battery in that thing.

1443
00:51:53,053 --> 00:51:54,773
I just put a new one in, okay?

1444
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:55,607
So lay off.

1445
00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:57,168
Well then let's go back up there.

1446
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:58,430
No, let's go.

1447
00:51:58,431 --> 00:51:59,775
We're not going up there again-

1448
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:01,004
- You guys keep messing around

1449
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:02,490
then your girls are going
to show up at the campsite

1450
00:52:02,491 --> 00:52:04,105
before you even get back.

1451
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:06,911
Ooh, she does
finally have a point.

1452
00:52:06,912 --> 00:52:08,382
Let's just go, come on.

1453
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:09,452
Let's just fucking leave.

1454
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:11,379
Tyler, shut up.

1455
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,718
All right, I guess we'll go.

1456
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:13,552
Let's go.

1457
00:52:13,553 --> 00:52:16,302
To the house, finally.

1458
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:26,504
- Oh dude.
- This is crazy.

1459
00:52:26,505 --> 00:52:28,518
I can't believe
we're fucking doing this.

1460
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,352
Shh.

1461
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:30,606
Don't shut your door loud. Okay?

1462
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:31,607
Okay.

1463
00:52:32,957 --> 00:52:33,790
Guys, this is a terrible idea.

1464
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:34,623
We shouldn't do this.

1465
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:35,715
Griffin, shut up man.

1466
00:52:35,716 --> 00:52:37,331
It's fine, alright?

1467
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:38,296
Dude, we can't do this.

1468
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:39,129
Dude.

1469
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,815
Let's just go in.

1470
00:52:40,816 --> 00:52:41,846
It's gonna be fun.

1471
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:43,171
We're not gonna
get in trouble, okay?

1472
00:52:43,172 --> 00:52:44,532
Alright, let's go.

1473
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:45,827
Let's go check this shit out.

1474
00:52:45,828 --> 00:52:46,988
Whoa, whoa, shit dude.

1475
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:47,822
What?

1476
00:52:47,823 --> 00:52:49,350
I think it's a fucking cop.

1477
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:51,590
There's a
fucking cop still here.

1478
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:52,424
We're definitely
gonna get in trouble.

1479
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:54,342
Yeah, that is
definitely a cop car.

1480
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:55,801
Guys, we can get donuts.

1481
00:52:55,802 --> 00:52:57,737
Guys, I'm dead serious I just got-

1482
00:52:57,738 --> 00:52:59,396
Griffin, fucking get down dude.

1483
00:52:59,397 --> 00:53:00,489
We can't do this.

1484
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,323
Yes we can.

1485
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:02,477
Let's just go back.

1486
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:04,027
Let's just go back to the campsite.

1487
00:53:04,028 --> 00:53:04,861
It's freezing out here.

1488
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:05,706
We're already here.

1489
00:53:05,707 --> 00:53:06,968
I mean-

1490
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:08,256
- Well, what are we gonna do?

1491
00:53:08,257 --> 00:53:09,670
We can't sneak around him.

1492
00:53:09,671 --> 00:53:10,565
I mean, no way.

1493
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:11,768
Let's go through the back.

1494
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:13,041
No, we can't go
round back, he'll catch us.

1495
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:14,312
Let's call in a prank call.

1496
00:53:14,313 --> 00:53:15,261
Dude, are you fucking-

1497
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:16,094
- No.
- No.

1498
00:53:16,095 --> 00:53:17,893
Dude, I guarantee it'll fuckin' work.

1499
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,510
No dude, fucking bad idea.

1500
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:20,344
It could work.

1501
00:53:20,345 --> 00:53:21,790
Is there any other way around this pig?

1502
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,045
Dude, I don't think so.

1503
00:53:23,046 --> 00:53:25,670
Dude, let's just
go I like Griffin's idea.

1504
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:27,555
Let's just go back to
the fucking place, okay?

1505
00:53:27,556 --> 00:53:30,862
But we came here to check it
out, we might as well go in.

1506
00:53:30,863 --> 00:53:32,832
There's a cop, do you
want to go to fucking jail?

1507
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:35,364
I don't, I really don't want to go there.

1508
00:53:35,365 --> 00:53:37,381
God, that is fuckin' stupid.

1509
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,645
Let's just, let's leave.

1510
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:41,666
Yeah, I'd like to report a break in

1511
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,607
at Finley's Machine and Welding
Shop on Christie Avenue.

1512
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:47,461
Dude, shut the fuck up.

1513
00:53:47,462 --> 00:53:48,962
Get off the phone.

1514
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:53,576
Yeah, I drove by earlier and there was

1515
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:57,305
a guy, broke the glass,
entered the building.

1516
00:53:57,306 --> 00:53:58,358
No.

1517
00:53:58,359 --> 00:54:00,830
Yeah, yeah on Christie Avenue.

1518
00:54:00,831 --> 00:54:03,079
Gavin, no.

1519
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,366
All right, thank you.

1520
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,356
Thank you officer, bye.

1521
00:54:06,357 --> 00:54:08,977
Are you fucking serious, dude?

1522
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:10,289
You know how much trouble
we're gonna get in?

1523
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,354
Shut up dude, watch this.

1524
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:14,353
What the fuck, oh my God.

1525
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:15,604
No fucking way.

1526
00:54:17,235 --> 00:54:19,662
Hey, what'd I tell you guys?

1527
00:54:19,663 --> 00:54:20,496
I don't wanna
go to jail for this.

1528
00:54:20,497 --> 00:54:21,659
No, we are not fucking, no.

1529
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,998
You guys are being crazy.

1530
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:24,602
Are you fucking stupid, dude?

1531
00:54:24,603 --> 00:54:26,755
You know how much
trouble we're fucking in?

1532
00:54:26,756 --> 00:54:29,235
Fuck you guys, what
excuse do you have now, Jed?

1533
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:30,210
Look, we got the house,
this is what we came for.

1534
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,043
How about going to jail?

1535
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:32,626
That's a fucking good
enough excuse for me.

1536
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:34,247
The cop is not here,
so how could we go to jail?

1537
00:54:34,248 --> 00:54:35,081
Oh my God.

1538
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:36,728
He's gonna
come back eventually.

1539
00:54:36,729 --> 00:54:37,986
I'm not doing
anything stupid, getting

1540
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:39,591
in trouble and going to jail.

1541
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:40,826
Dude, fuck this shit, Gavin.

1542
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:41,827
Let's go, come on.

1543
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:43,640
Dude, Gavin?

1544
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:45,141
Where are you fucking going Gavin?

1545
00:54:45,142 --> 00:54:46,745
Gavin, get your fucking ass back here.

1546
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:47,749
Wait up, wait up.

1547
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,958
What the fuck?

1548
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:51,762
Gosh dang it, Gavin.

1549
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:53,099
Gavin, get your fucking ass-

1550
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,931
- Gavin, come back.

1551
00:55:00,252 --> 00:55:01,585
- Gavin.
- Gavin.

1552
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:04,419
Is he seriously going inside?

1553
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,463
Oh my God, are
you fucking serious?

1554
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:10,030
Gavin?

1555
00:55:10,031 --> 00:55:13,060
Dude, where in the fuck is he?

1556
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:14,274
Dude.

1557
00:55:14,275 --> 00:55:15,980
I'm ready to go, Jed.

1558
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:17,680
Do you actually
think he went inside, man?

1559
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,481
Fuck, I hope not.

1560
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,315
Hey man, you gotta come see this.

1561
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,488
Dude Tyler, what
the hell are you doing?

1562
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,027
- What is it?
- This better be good.

1563
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:24,861
Did you find him?

1564
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:26,226
What the fuck is going on here?

1565
00:55:26,227 --> 00:55:28,355
I guarantee you that
they're doing something.

1566
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:29,189
Yeah, you know
they're gonna be playing with us.

1567
00:55:29,189 --> 00:55:30,022
The door is open.

1568
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:30,855
Oh my God.

1569
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,178
And the other
door inside is open.

1570
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:33,460
We're not going in.

1571
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:34,742
Did you fucking open that dude?

1572
00:55:34,743 --> 00:55:37,142
I didn't open this, Gavin
just went in there, has to be.

1573
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:38,392
Do you know where he is.

1574
00:55:38,393 --> 00:55:39,226
Come on.

1575
00:55:39,227 --> 00:55:40,700
I don't know where
he's at, this is not me.

1576
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:43,197
This is Gavin being Gavin right now.

1577
00:55:43,198 --> 00:55:44,483
You're in on it, you have to be.

1578
00:55:44,484 --> 00:55:45,752
I'm not in on it.

1579
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:47,226
This is his stupid shit.

1580
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:49,380
And he's in there right
now at a crime scene.

1581
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:50,445
We need to go get him.

1582
00:55:50,446 --> 00:55:51,444
We're not gonna get him.

1583
00:55:51,445 --> 00:55:52,523
We're gonna
get in so much trouble.

1584
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:53,904
Griffin, Griffin, Griffin.

1585
00:55:53,905 --> 00:55:55,215
First of all,
what if that cop comes back?

1586
00:55:55,216 --> 00:55:57,338
And second of all, he
went in there by himself.

1587
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:58,315
Let him come out by himself.

1588
00:55:58,315 --> 00:55:59,148
Exactly.

1589
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,516
We can't leave somebody
behind like that.

1590
00:56:00,517 --> 00:56:01,350
Let's just go in, get-

1591
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:03,416
- Griffin he gets caught,
we're all fucked, alright?

1592
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:04,250
What if the
killer's still in there?

1593
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,122
He probably could be.

1594
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:05,955
Man, there's no killer.

1595
00:56:05,956 --> 00:56:07,707
Dude, they caught the fucking guy.

1596
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,720
Let's just go in, alright?

1597
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:09,554
It'll take like a couple of-

1598
00:56:09,554 --> 00:56:10,387
- I don't wanna go in.

1599
00:56:10,388 --> 00:56:11,793
It'll just take a few
seconds, pop in real quick.

1600
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:12,627
Let's get him, come on.

1601
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:13,460
Okay, can we go
in, and then we come out.

1602
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:14,869
We gotta stick
together, alright guys?

1603
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:15,703
Alright, it's fine, let's go.

1604
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:16,748
This better be fucking quick.

1605
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,082
Gavin.

1606
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:20,992
Gav, come on, man.

1607
00:56:20,993 --> 00:56:22,150
This shit's stupid.

1608
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:23,945
This is so Gavin.

1609
00:56:23,946 --> 00:56:25,283
[Tyler] Holy shit

1610
00:56:25,284 --> 00:56:27,074
- What?
- What do you see, man?

1611
00:56:27,075 --> 00:56:29,138
Oh my goodness.

1612
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:29,972
I'm not going in there.

1613
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:32,598
- Oh my God.
- What the fuck?

1614
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:35,196
Is that fucking
blood all over that lamp?

1615
00:56:35,197 --> 00:56:36,347
Holy shit.

1616
00:56:36,348 --> 00:56:37,343
- Oh my God.
- Let's fucking leave.

1617
00:56:37,344 --> 00:56:39,321
This is
fucking blood everywhere.

1618
00:56:39,322 --> 00:56:40,940
Griff, dude, check this shit out.

1619
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:42,914
Are you kidding me right now?

1620
00:56:42,915 --> 00:56:43,898
Tyler, get your light over here.

1621
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:45,078
This is really gross guys.

1622
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:46,042
It stinks in here, let's leave.

1623
00:56:46,043 --> 00:56:47,078
What the fuck is-

1624
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:47,912
- That's fuckin' blood, man.

1625
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:49,412
Oh my God.

1626
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:53,667
Gavin, where
the fuck are you, man?

1627
00:56:53,668 --> 00:56:54,501
Please, let's go.

1628
00:56:54,502 --> 00:56:55,775
This is fucking crazy guys.

1629
00:56:55,776 --> 00:56:57,276
We gotta get the fuck outta here.

1630
00:56:57,277 --> 00:56:59,225
Gavin come on
man, quit messing around.

1631
00:56:59,226 --> 00:57:00,803
Alright girls, come on.

1632
00:57:02,033 --> 00:57:03,269
Guys, we gotta
get the fuck outta here.

1633
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,354
Dude, I think he might be in here.

1634
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:11,422
Tyler, that's not
even funny dude seriously?

1635
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,522
Whatever, man.

1636
00:57:12,523 --> 00:57:14,046
We gotta find Gavin
and get the fuck outta here.

1637
00:57:14,047 --> 00:57:17,021
Gavin, what the
fuck are you doing man?

1638
00:57:17,022 --> 00:57:18,667
Gav, come on, man.

1639
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,621
Dude, this is so fucked up.

1640
00:57:20,622 --> 00:57:22,368
What the fuck is that?

1641
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:24,252
- What is that?
- Is that blood?

1642
00:57:24,253 --> 00:57:25,799
- Holy shit.
- Yes, it's blood.

1643
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,012
Looks like a fucking symbol.

1644
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:28,164
Let's fucking leave.

1645
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:30,013
That's a
symbol of some kind, guys.

1646
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:31,342
Tyler, look it
up on your phone man.

1647
00:57:31,343 --> 00:57:32,888
Is that in blood, is that-

1648
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:35,317
- You guys, let's
leave please, let's leave.

1649
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,484
This is scaring the shit out of me.

1650
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:37,898
Are you kidding me right now?

1651
00:57:37,899 --> 00:57:38,732
What?

1652
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:40,394
I can't get any service on my phone.

1653
00:57:40,395 --> 00:57:42,297
Those girls are texting,
they're probably calling.

1654
00:57:42,298 --> 00:57:44,606
You're seriously worried
about those girls right now?

1655
00:57:44,607 --> 00:57:46,253
Yes, I'm worried about those girls.

1656
00:57:48,356 --> 00:57:49,189
- Holy fuck.
- What the fuck is that?

1657
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,962
Dude, what the fuck is that shit?

1658
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:52,469
Is that fucking blood?

1659
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,410
Oh my God.

1660
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:54,825
This isn't funny any more.

1661
00:57:54,826 --> 00:57:56,760
Come on guys,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1662
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:57,618
No, we gotta go up there

1663
00:57:57,619 --> 00:57:58,910
and we gotta make sure everybody's okay.

1664
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:00,641
Dude, no-

1665
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:01,816
- Dude, someone has to be up there.

1666
00:58:01,817 --> 00:58:03,086
There's no way something just fell over

1667
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:03,920
to make that noise.

1668
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:05,297
Just leave them there.

1669
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:06,560
There has to be someone hurt.

1670
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:08,026
You see the fucking
blood, are you serious?

1671
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:08,860
Let's just go up there

1672
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,244
and check, make sure they're okay.

1673
00:58:10,245 --> 00:58:12,141
No, I'm gonna leave.

1674
00:58:12,142 --> 00:58:14,216
We're all here and we're all safe already.

1675
00:58:14,217 --> 00:58:15,354
Why don't we just get the fuck outta here?

1676
00:58:15,355 --> 00:58:17,087
You stay right
there, we'll be right back.

1677
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:18,560
Griff stay here,
keep your camera on.

1678
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,090
We're going up, let's go.

1679
00:58:20,923 --> 00:58:21,934
It'll be alright, come on.

1680
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:23,209
Hey, is anyone up here?

1681
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,099
- Hello?
- Hey, be careful.

1682
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,357
Hey, we're here to help you, man.

1683
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:28,493
Hello?

1684
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:29,327
You're gonna do anything.

1685
00:58:29,328 --> 00:58:32,402
You better watch out motherfucker.

1686
00:58:32,403 --> 00:58:33,736
Hello?

1687
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,894
Oh my God, I
can't believe this shit.

1688
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:42,653
I can't believe
they really left us down here.

1689
00:58:42,654 --> 00:58:43,544
I know.

1690
00:58:43,545 --> 00:58:45,485
Let's just leave,
let's just fucking leave.

1691
00:58:45,486 --> 00:58:47,077
This is complete bullshit.

1692
00:58:47,078 --> 00:58:49,142
I mean, it seemed like
a good idea at first,

1693
00:58:49,143 --> 00:58:50,839
but really I'm just ready to go.

1694
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,506
Yeah.

1695
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:53,959
They need to get the fuck down here

1696
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,161
and we need to get fuck the out of here.

1697
00:58:56,162 --> 00:58:57,692
Cause this is fucking creepy.

1698
00:58:57,693 --> 00:59:00,193
This is really scary.

1699
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:03,084
Oh my-

1700
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,141
Did you guys hear that?

1701
00:59:04,142 --> 00:59:05,991
Hear what?

1702
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:08,305
I don't know,
I think it was over there?

1703
00:59:08,306 --> 00:59:09,574
Just leave it alone.

1704
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:11,592
We'll just try to ignore it.

1705
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,611
Let's just wait till they come down here.

1706
00:59:13,612 --> 00:59:14,862
No.

1707
00:59:16,896 --> 00:59:17,856
Let's see what it is.

1708
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:18,826
Let's just wait.

1709
00:59:18,827 --> 00:59:20,739
No, let's see what it is.

1710
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,907
You guys follow right behind me, okay?

1711
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,519
Okay.

1712
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:33,578
I'm just gonna
open it up, and find out.

1713
00:59:42,614 --> 00:59:44,041
Dude.

1714
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:46,241
Gavin come on, man.

1715
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:47,075
Why are you
laughing, this is not funny.

1716
00:59:47,076 --> 00:59:48,344
This is not funny, man.

1717
00:59:48,345 --> 00:59:50,187
You guys have gotta come
check this out upstairs.

1718
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:52,164
Why would we wanna go anywhere with you?

1719
00:59:52,165 --> 00:59:53,871
I don't wanna go
upstairs, I really don't.

1720
00:59:53,872 --> 00:59:56,441
You wanna stay down here?

1721
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:57,731
- No.
- No.

1722
00:59:57,732 --> 01:00:00,311
Alright, let's go check this out.

1723
01:00:00,312 --> 01:00:01,388
What is it, man?

1724
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,994
You'll see, just follow me.

1725
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:05,194
This is not funny.

1726
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:07,864
If you guys are pulling
something, this is not funny.

1727
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:10,865
Just chill man, everything's fine.

1728
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:14,745
It's a dead body.

1729
01:00:14,746 --> 01:00:16,523
- A dead body?
- What?

1730
01:00:16,524 --> 01:00:18,311
I'm serious, a dead body.

1731
01:00:18,312 --> 01:00:19,561
I don't think
we should go up here then

1732
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:20,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1733
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:22,379
You have to to see it.

1734
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,715
Where's Jed and Tyler?

1735
01:00:23,716 --> 01:00:26,452
Dude, they're up there.

1736
01:00:26,453 --> 01:00:27,453
Look.

1737
01:00:28,151 --> 01:00:30,151
I don't think
we should go in there.

1738
01:00:30,152 --> 01:00:30,989
Holy shit, I thought that

1739
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,256
they got all the bodies out.

1740
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:33,467
No fucking way.

1741
01:00:33,468 --> 01:00:34,593
It's someone we know.

1742
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:35,982
- No it's not.
- Someone we know?

1743
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:36,816
Yeah, it is.

1744
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:37,649
No it's not.

1745
01:00:37,649 --> 01:00:38,521
Let's get outta here.

1746
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:39,354
Let's not go in there.

1747
01:00:39,354 --> 01:00:40,187
Seriously.

1748
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:41,020
Dude, no, no, no, no.

1749
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:42,268
Let's get out of here man.

1750
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:43,113
Seriously, it's someone we know.

1751
01:00:43,114 --> 01:00:44,120
Dude, let's leave it.

1752
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:45,420
This is a crime scene investigation.

1753
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:46,872
Come on in, seriously.

1754
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:47,749
We'll just-

1755
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,752
- Pull the sheet
back, it's someone we know.

1756
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:50,586
I'm not pulling
that sheet back, man.

1757
01:00:50,587 --> 01:00:52,367
Oh my God,
don't fuckin' kick it.

1758
01:00:52,368 --> 01:00:53,201
Pull the sheet back.

1759
01:00:53,202 --> 01:00:54,249
No, you pull it back, man.

1760
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,262
I'm not pulling that shit back.

1761
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,275
Seriously.

1762
01:01:00,598 --> 01:01:01,743
That's not funny, man.

1763
01:01:01,744 --> 01:01:03,112
How about having some
respect for the dead?

1764
01:01:03,113 --> 01:01:04,113
Son of a bitch?

1765
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:06,257
That's not funny, man.

1766
01:01:06,258 --> 01:01:07,204
What the fuck is this?

1767
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,454
And you were a part of this?

1768
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:09,914
Andrea it's fine.

1769
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:10,748
No, it's not fine.

1770
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:12,546
Paint can, I
think it fell off a ladder-

1771
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,060
- You seriously
scared the shit outta me, man.

1772
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:16,047
You guys are
assholes, it's not even funny.

1773
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:17,267
Alright, let's just...

1774
01:01:17,268 --> 01:01:18,671
Okay, we'll get the fuck outta, wait-

1775
01:01:18,672 --> 01:01:19,614
Where the fuck's Gavin at?

1776
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:21,698
- Oh, great.
- Oh my gosh.

1777
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:22,669
He does this all the time.

1778
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,002
Gav.

1779
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:31,250
Gav, come on, dude.

1780
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:32,666
Quit running off man.

1781
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:33,500
Gavin, where the fuck are you at?

1782
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:34,667
- Gavin.
- Gav?

1783
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:38,778
Hello, Gavin?

1784
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:42,914
Gavin, where the fuck are you at?

1785
01:01:42,915 --> 01:01:43,748
What's up?

1786
01:01:43,749 --> 01:01:45,732
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

1787
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:46,588
Are you pissing?

1788
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:49,537
Dude, what the fuck?

1789
01:01:49,538 --> 01:01:51,101
Are you fucking pissing
in there, for real?

1790
01:01:51,102 --> 01:01:52,814
You playing with it in there, boy?

1791
01:01:52,815 --> 01:01:55,252
Fucking dumb-ass, I swear-

1792
01:01:58,868 --> 01:02:02,674
- Hey, help.

1793
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:04,130
Dude, seriously, help me.

1794
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,748
- Whoa, shit dude.
- What the fuck?

1795
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:11,893
- What is it?
- Holy shit, dude.

1796
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,489
Where'd he go?

1797
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:18,323
Bullshit, I guarantee
he went out that window.

1798
01:02:23,468 --> 01:02:24,738
Where the hell is Gavin at?

1799
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:26,393
I don't know man
he was just in there-

1800
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:27,566
- Man, you you saw the blood.

1801
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:28,863
He's not in there, okay?

1802
01:02:28,864 --> 01:02:30,872
I think he's hurt, we need
to go find him right now.

1803
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:32,230
This has you and Gavin
written all over it, man.

1804
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:33,485
This has nothing to
do with me and Gavin.

1805
01:02:33,486 --> 01:02:35,226
You were fucking with
us downstairs, man.

1806
01:02:35,227 --> 01:02:36,877
Dude, I don't care.

1807
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,318
We need to go find Gavin, right now.

1808
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:42,539
I'll beat your ass.

1809
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:43,372
Tyler, no fucking calm down.

1810
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:46,512
No, we need to find Gavin, right now.

1811
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:47,798
All right, okay, okay.

1812
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:49,117
We'll go downstairs, we'll check-

1813
01:02:49,118 --> 01:02:50,818
- Then go, let's go.

1814
01:02:50,819 --> 01:02:51,987
Dude.

1815
01:02:51,988 --> 01:02:53,572
Fuck it, let's just go come on.

1816
01:02:53,573 --> 01:02:54,748
Gosh dang it.

1817
01:02:54,749 --> 01:02:55,582
Whatever, man.

1818
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:56,739
Gavin?

1819
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,254
Gosh dang it.

1820
01:02:58,255 --> 01:02:59,255
Oh my God.

1821
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,149
Some fucking camping trip.

1822
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,844
Gavin, come on dude, seriously.

1823
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:04,936
Come on man, this isn't funny.

1824
01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:06,187
We're not playing anymore.

1825
01:03:06,188 --> 01:03:07,355
Gavin.

1826
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:11,660
Oh fucking shit, such fucking bullshit.

1827
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:14,374
Help, help.

1828
01:03:16,603 --> 01:03:18,822
Fucking shit.

1829
01:03:18,823 --> 01:03:21,402
What the fuck was that?

1830
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:28,143
Go, go, get
the fuck outta here.

1831
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:30,274
Hurry up, you guys.

1832
01:03:30,275 --> 01:03:31,275
Go faster.

1833
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:37,843
Fuck it's bolted.

1834
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,334
Dude, no, whoa, wait, wait...

1835
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:42,212
What the fuck do you
think you're doing, dude?

1836
01:03:42,213 --> 01:03:43,317
I'm gonna break the window.

1837
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:45,091
No dude, you're
not gonna fucking break

1838
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:46,355
no fucking window.

1839
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,505
No, you're not, dude.

1840
01:03:47,506 --> 01:03:48,556
No, you're not fucking breaking-

1841
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:49,390
- Just let him break it.

1842
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:50,428
Andrea, shut up.

1843
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:51,262
Dammit you're not.

1844
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:52,095
Don't fucking
tell me to shut up.

1845
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:53,025
You're not gonna fucking break

1846
01:03:53,026 --> 01:03:54,277
no fucking window, okay?

1847
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:55,747
Dude, if they are fucking with us,

1848
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,282
we're going to be in so
much shit you have no-

1849
01:03:57,283 --> 01:03:58,542
- I don't even
buy that right now.

1850
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,282
Andrea, I don't
even fucking care right now.

1851
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:02,525
Griffin, if you fucking break that window,

1852
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:03,697
we're gonna be fucked, alright?

1853
01:04:03,698 --> 01:04:05,870
We're gonna go upstairs, we're
gonna find a window open,

1854
01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:08,020
we're gonna climb the fuck out, alright?

1855
01:04:08,021 --> 01:04:09,580
What if there is no fucking window open?

1856
01:04:09,581 --> 01:04:10,414
Then do what you gotta do, fucker.

1857
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:11,247
We don't have time
for that right now, let's go.

1858
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,080
No, we can't.

1859
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:12,913
Let's get out of here.

1860
01:04:12,914 --> 01:04:14,246
Fucking-

1861
01:04:18,204 --> 01:04:19,362
I'm telling you right now, Andrea,

1862
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:22,342
this has Gavin and Tyler
written all over it.

1863
01:04:22,343 --> 01:04:23,624
Jed, this isn't a joke.

1864
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,610
I guarantee
they're hiding somewhere.

1865
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,860
They're not hiding.

1866
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:29,349
I guarantee you they are.

1867
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:33,850
Just check those windows
over there or something okay?

1868
01:04:40,132 --> 01:04:42,395
Dammit,
they're all bolted shut.

1869
01:04:42,396 --> 01:04:45,053
Hey calm down, it'll be okay, God.

1870
01:04:45,054 --> 01:04:46,343
It's not gonna be okay.

1871
01:04:46,344 --> 01:04:48,511
I promise it will.

1872
01:04:49,612 --> 01:04:51,515
Oh, there's sleeping bags.

1873
01:04:51,516 --> 01:04:52,349
It's kinda eerie to think

1874
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,770
the last people that slept
in these are dead now.

1875
01:04:54,771 --> 01:04:57,211
Yeah, real weird.

1876
01:04:57,212 --> 01:04:58,621
Hey, go check in
that room over there, see if

1877
01:04:58,622 --> 01:05:01,122
there's a window or something.

1878
01:05:02,271 --> 01:05:05,159
Oh, hey, check out these pictures.

1879
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,486
As you walk past the eyes
just kinda follow you.

1880
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:09,500
Jed, this is not
the time to look at pictures.

1881
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:11,147
- What, hey.
- This is serious.

1882
01:05:11,148 --> 01:05:12,825
Hey, it'll be okay, calm down.

1883
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,474
It's not gonna be okay.

1884
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:16,224
We're gonna die in here.

1885
01:05:16,225 --> 01:05:17,452
Andrea, I'm telling you right now

1886
01:05:17,453 --> 01:05:19,945
that in one of these rooms,
Gavin and Tyler are waiting

1887
01:05:19,946 --> 01:05:21,745
with the biggest smile
on their face, okay?

1888
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:23,220
They are not waiting.

1889
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:24,054
Andrea, I'm-

1890
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:24,997
- This isn't one of their pranks.

1891
01:05:24,997 --> 01:05:25,910
Andrea, I'm telling-

1892
01:05:25,911 --> 01:05:27,370
Andrea, I know my friends
better than anyone.

1893
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:29,129
I guarantee it, this is them.

1894
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:31,428
No, no, we're gonna die in here.

1895
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:32,262
Andrea, we're-

1896
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:33,095
- We're really gonna die in here.

1897
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,591
Andrea, we are not
gonna die, just calm down.

1898
01:05:35,592 --> 01:05:37,866
Don't tell me to calm down.

1899
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,367
Come here.

1900
01:05:55,406 --> 01:05:56,239
51 to central.

1901
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,178
I'll be back out in the
car at 501 East Avenue

1902
01:05:58,179 --> 01:06:00,262
for that security detail.

1903
01:06:03,282 --> 01:06:06,449
51 set up 10, four.

1904
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,361
Son of a
bitch I just bought that,

1905
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:16,612
and now that shit's everywhere.

1906
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:28,063
51, four, 10, four.

1907
01:06:38,242 --> 01:06:39,659
Son of a bitch.

1908
01:06:59,584 --> 01:07:00,493
All right, I'm telling you

1909
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:01,767
that Tyler and Gavin are upstairs.

1910
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:02,601
We're just gonna go upstairs-

1911
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,434
- I'm not going upstairs.

1912
01:07:03,435 --> 01:07:04,529
What do you mean
you're not going upstairs?

1913
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,451
I'm not going upstairs.

1914
01:07:06,452 --> 01:07:08,758
What we need to do is go back downstairs,

1915
01:07:08,759 --> 01:07:10,680
let Griffin bust open the damn window

1916
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:12,246
so we can get the hell out of here.

1917
01:07:12,247 --> 01:07:14,336
Andrea, we've talked
about this time and time again.

1918
01:07:14,337 --> 01:07:15,992
I'm telling you Gavin and Tyler

1919
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:17,522
are the ones behind this
and they're upstairs.

1920
01:07:17,523 --> 01:07:18,356
They're not behind this.

1921
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:19,358
Okay, if anything,
we can maybe find

1922
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,287
a window to open.

1923
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,120
So come on, you're coming.

1924
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:22,250
- This is so stupid.
- Let's go.

1925
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,450
All right, You can call
it stupid all you want,

1926
01:07:23,451 --> 01:07:24,515
but I guarantee you Tyler
and Gavin are up here.

1927
01:07:24,516 --> 01:07:25,715
I guarantee
they're not up here.

1928
01:07:25,716 --> 01:07:27,034
Tyler, Gavin, come out.

1929
01:07:27,035 --> 01:07:29,314
I know you're up here hiding somewhere.

1930
01:07:29,315 --> 01:07:30,550
I told you.

1931
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,547
All right, See
those windows over there,

1932
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,591
Go over there and open that one.

1933
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:34,532
I'm gonna open this one.

1934
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:36,804
Uh, no I'm not checking those windows.

1935
01:07:36,805 --> 01:07:37,978
What do you mean
you're not gonna check them?

1936
01:07:37,979 --> 01:07:40,367
I'm not checking them, I
said it plain and simple.

1937
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:41,546
We need to go back downstairs.

1938
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:43,596
Andrea no, we
are going to fucking get-

1939
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:44,861
Oh my God, alright, fine.

1940
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:47,488
I'm gonna go check those,
you can stay the fuck here.

1941
01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:48,322
Alright, whatever.

1942
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:50,204
Whatever, go
check your damn windows.

1943
01:07:50,205 --> 01:07:51,974
Hey oh hey, are
you okay over there, huh?

1944
01:07:51,975 --> 01:07:53,308
I'm just fine, jackass.

1945
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:54,532
Fine, we're in the fucking-

1946
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:55,439
- Stupid.

1947
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,877
So fucking retarded.

1948
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:01,230
Fucking shit.

1949
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:07,405
Andrea?

1950
01:08:07,406 --> 01:08:08,337
What-

1951
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:10,431
Andrea, where are you at?

1952
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:13,569
Andrea?

1953
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:14,570
Fuck, shit.

1954
01:08:15,943 --> 01:08:17,443
Andrea are you in here?

1955
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:20,242
Fuck Andrea, where the fuck is you at?

1956
01:08:20,243 --> 01:08:21,243
Fuck, shit.

1957
01:08:23,203 --> 01:08:24,784
- Dude, what happened?
- Where's Andrea?

1958
01:08:24,785 --> 01:08:25,885
Fuckin' Andrea.

1959
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:27,664
I don't know, she was
there and she was gone

1960
01:08:27,665 --> 01:08:28,599
I think someone fucking took her, guys.

1961
01:08:28,599 --> 01:08:29,432
Do you know who it was?

1962
01:08:29,433 --> 01:08:30,564
I have no fucking idea.

1963
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:32,695
She was just there and God,
I don't know what to do.

1964
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:33,611
Dude-

1965
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:34,502
- What?

1966
01:08:34,503 --> 01:08:36,287
Just calm down, just calm down.

1967
01:08:36,288 --> 01:08:39,997
Dude, I can't be calm,
she has to be here somewhere.

1968
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:40,831
- Just calm down.
- Calm down, man.

1969
01:08:40,832 --> 01:08:43,183
Just go downstairs.

1970
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:44,562
Dude, I'm dead serious man.

1971
01:08:44,563 --> 01:08:46,921
There's something wrong,
she wouldn't do this.

1972
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:47,755
Fucking shit.

1973
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,721
Just calm down, just go
downstairs, we'll stay up here.

1974
01:08:49,722 --> 01:08:51,355
Shit, guys I-

1975
01:08:51,356 --> 01:08:52,189
- We're gonna find her.

1976
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:53,022
Jed, Jed.

1977
01:08:53,023 --> 01:08:58,022
Dude, I can't, I
just can't do it.

1978
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:01,823
I don't know where the fuck she is.

1979
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:05,627
Andrea?

1980
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:08,548
Andrea, is that you?

1981
01:09:20,242 --> 01:09:22,742
Hey Andrea, are you down here?

1982
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,208
Oh fuck, oh shit.

1983
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:39,907
Hey Andrea?

1984
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:50,854
Andrea, are you here?

1985
01:09:50,855 --> 01:09:53,105
If you hear my voice, yell.

1986
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:03,735
What the fuck is this?

1987
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:06,991
Andrea?

1988
01:10:07,991 --> 01:10:09,569
What the fuck?

1989
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:10,570
Andrea?

1990
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,610
Andrea, are you here?

1991
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:17,098
What the fuck?

1992
01:10:18,527 --> 01:10:19,527
Oh my God.

1993
01:10:20,456 --> 01:10:21,456
Oh shit.

1994
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,182
Where could she be?

1995
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:45,997
Oh shit.

1996
01:11:45,998 --> 01:11:47,286
Oh fuck.

1997
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:48,954
We need to find her.

1998
01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:54,211
Yeah, I don't know Dee.

1999
01:11:54,212 --> 01:11:56,762
I really don't see a
trace of her anywhere.

2000
01:11:56,763 --> 01:11:59,162
Oh shit.

2001
01:11:59,163 --> 01:12:00,938
I'll look in this room.

2002
01:12:00,939 --> 01:12:03,772
All right, be careful.

2003
01:12:08,394 --> 01:12:09,394
Shit.

2004
01:12:13,646 --> 01:12:15,134
Griff.

2005
01:12:15,135 --> 01:12:18,631
Fuck, you just
scared the hell out of me.

2006
01:12:18,632 --> 01:12:19,856
I'm sorry, babe.

2007
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:21,104
What?

2008
01:12:21,105 --> 01:12:23,272
Should we go downstairs?

2009
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:27,588
Yeah, I guess.

2010
01:12:27,589 --> 01:12:31,684
Oh my God I'm just freaking out right now.

2011
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:33,102
Hold on a second.

2012
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:38,186
Oh yeah, let's go.

2013
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,414
Fuck, my lamp
is not working, fuck.

2014
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:42,832
Shit.

2015
01:12:43,758 --> 01:12:46,359
Just leave it, just
leave it, just leave it.

2016
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,277
Let's just go find Jed.

2017
01:12:54,389 --> 01:12:55,578
Shit, where'd he go?

2018
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:57,238
I don't know.

2019
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,656
Shit.

2020
01:13:04,734 --> 01:13:05,788
Told him to stay down here.

2021
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:07,970
Look, the
basement door is open.

2022
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:10,258
Alright, you stand right here.

2023
01:13:10,259 --> 01:13:11,544
I'm gonna go down there
and check things out.

2024
01:13:11,545 --> 01:13:13,878
Okay, be careful.

2025
01:13:23,536 --> 01:13:24,869
Jed?

2026
01:13:28,061 --> 01:13:29,061
Guys?

2027
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:32,516
Hello?

2028
01:13:39,227 --> 01:13:41,372
Is anyone down here?

2029
01:13:41,373 --> 01:13:42,373
Guys?

2030
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:45,055
Jed?

2031
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:50,639
What the fuck?

2032
01:13:51,736 --> 01:13:53,486
Is that Jed's camera?

2033
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:56,648
Oh my God.

2034
01:13:59,632 --> 01:14:00,480
Shit, Haidee.

2035
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:04,313
Griffin.

2036
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,337
Haidee?

2037
01:14:09,338 --> 01:14:11,335
Where the fuck are you?

2038
01:14:29,491 --> 01:14:31,861
Oh shit, what the fuck?

2039
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:35,095
Oh my God.

2040
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,730
I've gotta get the fuck outta here.

2041
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:38,148
Shit, shit, shit.

2042
01:14:44,812 --> 01:14:45,812
Oh God.

2043
01:14:46,999 --> 01:14:47,999
Gavin?

2044
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:06,499
There it is.

2045
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,583
Oh, my God.

2046
01:15:08,778 --> 01:15:09,611
It's our first house.

2047
01:15:09,612 --> 01:15:12,362
Honey, I can't believe we did it.

2048
01:15:12,363 --> 01:15:13,512
Oh my God, honey.

2049
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:16,231
It's freaking' huge.

2050
01:15:16,232 --> 01:15:17,903
Oh my God.

2051
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:18,737
It's our first house.

2052
01:15:18,738 --> 01:15:19,740
It's huge, I mean it's huge.

2053
01:15:19,741 --> 01:15:20,973
It is huge.

2054
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:23,891
Oh, go over by the sign.
Oh, yes.

2055
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:28,412
- It's ours.
- It is.

2056
01:15:28,413 --> 01:15:29,622
Oh my God, okay come on in, come on in.

2057
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:30,789
We gotta go in.

2058
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:32,305
This is amazing.

2059
01:15:32,306 --> 01:15:33,139
Oh my God, there's so many things

2060
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:36,839
I can't wait to do in the dining room.

2061
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,519
Honey, look at this porch.

2062
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,353
You haven't even went inside yet

2063
01:15:39,353 --> 01:15:40,186
and you're still-

2064
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,745
- It's ours.

2065
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:44,246
Here, get us a shot you and I.

2066
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:47,447
Our first house.

2067
01:15:47,448 --> 01:15:49,875
And I love the porch.

2068
01:15:49,876 --> 01:15:51,113
It wraps all the way around.

2069
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:55,364
Yeah, it's huge,
it is a very huge house.

2070
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,016
Wow.

2071
01:15:58,017 --> 01:15:59,267
Oh honey, look.

2072
01:16:02,919 --> 01:16:06,919
Alright, let's go in,
let's go in, I can't wait.

2073
01:16:07,946 --> 01:16:09,696
Here it is.

2074
01:16:12,032 --> 01:16:13,730
Oh my gosh.

2075
01:16:13,731 --> 01:16:15,275
So I think that that red couch we have

2076
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:17,609
is going right there, honey.

2077
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,767
Big front room.

2078
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:22,198
I love the fireplace.

2079
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:23,446
I love the mantle.

2080
01:16:23,447 --> 01:16:24,506
And I think it'll look really good

2081
01:16:24,507 --> 01:16:25,807
with like the red brick,

2082
01:16:25,808 --> 01:16:29,503
and that one painting we
have is going right there.

2083
01:16:29,504 --> 01:16:30,796
Yeah, the red and orange one?

2084
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:31,945
Let's go, yes.

2085
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:34,007
Let's go and see upstairs.

2086
01:16:34,008 --> 01:16:35,552
Kitchen.

2087
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:36,386
Moving on.

2088
01:16:36,387 --> 01:16:38,719
Oh, look at the staircase.

2089
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:43,452
Oh, I love it.

2090
01:16:43,453 --> 01:16:45,178
I think everything
is basically still original

2091
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:48,409
in this house, which is cool.

2092
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,993
It's really cool.

2093
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:55,806
So I definitely feel that
this could be the master.

2094
01:16:55,807 --> 01:16:56,640
I thought we agreed

2095
01:16:56,641 --> 01:16:57,749
that I was going to be on this floor

2096
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,512
and then the master is gonna be upstairs.

2097
01:16:59,513 --> 01:17:00,846
No, no, I definitely think
this will be the master,

2098
01:17:00,847 --> 01:17:03,788
and I think we could do, your den upstairs

2099
01:17:03,789 --> 01:17:05,052
because I love the fireplace.

2100
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,603
I love the mirror and I like all of that.

2101
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:09,521
Plus, darling, honey...

2102
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:15,949
Look how it connects to a
perfect first baby's room.

2103
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,063
There's another one over there.

2104
01:17:18,064 --> 01:17:20,880
I know, and we can wrap
around so it'll be both sides.

2105
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:22,739
And I love how the window goes...

2106
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,909
How the glass goes all the way down.

2107
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:26,859
And it lets in so much.

2108
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,067
I mean, there's so many
things I'm thinking.

2109
01:17:28,068 --> 01:17:30,026
Okay, let's go I want to
check out the upstairs.

2110
01:17:30,027 --> 01:17:31,743
Alright.

2111
01:17:31,744 --> 01:17:35,077
Okay, all right I'll let you go first.

2112
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:40,092
I think we just blew a breaker.

2113
01:17:40,093 --> 01:17:41,314
Oh, man.

2114
01:17:41,315 --> 01:17:43,239
The breaker box
is in the basement, right?

2115
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,837
- I think so.
- Alright.

2116
01:17:45,838 --> 01:17:47,037
Let's go down and find that, then.

2117
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:48,205
Okay.

2118
01:17:52,846 --> 01:17:54,846

01:18:07,832 --> 01:18:08,832

Hey everyone I'm Rheanon,
and welcome to my channel

2164
01:21:42,587 --> 01:21:45,078
where you come along with me
on my trips and adventures

2165
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:46,678
all over the world.

2166
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:47,958
This year for the month of October,

2167
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:50,182
I wanted to do something
a little different

2168
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:52,001
since I won't be traveling.

2169
01:21:52,002 --> 01:21:53,823
It's nothing bad I promise.

2170
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:54,774
So from now to Halloween,

2171
01:21:54,775 --> 01:21:57,343
I'll be naming off my bucket
list of haunted places

2172
01:21:57,344 --> 01:21:59,075
I want to visit.

2173
01:21:59,076 --> 01:22:01,993
So my first pick is the Owner House

2174
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:06,223
in Lawford County, Illinois.

2175
01:22:06,224 --> 01:22:07,164
I've always been so intrigued

2176
01:22:07,165 --> 01:22:09,125
by not only the murders and disappearances

2177
01:22:09,126 --> 01:22:12,571
that happened there, but
this beautiful house.

2178
01:22:12,572 --> 01:22:13,822
Ugh, I love it.

2179
01:22:14,751 --> 01:22:16,756
Out of all the places
on my list this October,

2180
01:22:16,757 --> 01:22:18,176
this one I will be seeing

2181
01:22:18,177 --> 01:22:21,419
in person, hopefully by next October.

2182
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,253
So at the end of the video,

2183
01:22:22,254 --> 01:22:24,224
be sure to subscribe and
hit that donate button

2184
01:22:24,225 --> 01:22:26,134
and help me get this trip funded.

2185
01:22:26,135 --> 01:22:28,692
Now we will dive
right into this for you.

2186
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:31,610
But first, a word from our sponsor.

2187
01:22:36,255 --> 01:22:37,139
Well folks, it's that time

2188
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,363
of the year again.

2189
01:22:38,364 --> 01:22:40,292
Alien Nation Sci-Fi Convention

2190
01:22:40,293 --> 01:22:42,542
is coming back to the Elliot Lake Arena.

2191
01:22:42,543 --> 01:22:44,907
Come meet your favorite B movie stars,

2192
01:22:44,908 --> 01:22:47,471
talk to a few conspiracy theorists,

2193
01:22:47,472 --> 01:22:49,064
and for the first time ever,

2194
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:50,611
you'll be able to lay your eyes

2195
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:52,344
on the personal spoon collection

2196
01:22:52,345 --> 01:22:55,070
of convicted killer Stabs McGee.

2197
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:55,904
Fucking Lawford.

2198
01:22:55,905 --> 01:22:57,866
Legend has it, he kills-

2199
01:22:57,867 --> 01:22:59,597
- Back to you, Mark.
