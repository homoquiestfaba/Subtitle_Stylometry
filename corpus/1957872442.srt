Hawaii?

6
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:49,661
We could go somewhere
more exciting.

7
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:52,042
Hawaii is exciting.

There were six guys
with ski masks.

We're pretty sure one
guy's name is Kalin.

That's his brother in there.

68
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,213
I've been trying to run
him down for a long time.

69
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,215
Maybe if you spent a little
less time at this hospital,

70
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,873
you could.

71
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:41,046
How is she?

72
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,289
She'll be all right.

They'll take her from the
hospital straight to the joint.

78
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,898
We'll get him.

79
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,694

hours til things calm down.

put him through the window.

First, we get Mark.

82
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,286
Then we worry about
finding that asshole, OK?

00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,091
Hi.

hide anyone in Iraq.

She needs to rest.

109
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:16,832
Yeah, so what kind of rest she
was getting when we walked in?

110

through the shoulder.

113
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,942
She's lost some blood,
but she'll be fine.

114
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:30,155
Holy tomato, you should
be a fashion model.

115
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,916
Look at that beautiful skin.

I planned that one.

It's like a joke.

123

You the one that's
really beautiful.

Did you know I taught Bruce Lee?

125
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,178
I was his teacher.

126

I love you.

135
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,025
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,992
Looks like you're going to
have to postpone the wedding.

137
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,338
We'll see.

138
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,789
John, look, I know you're
telling everyone she's fine,

139
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:21,413
but you know as well as I do if
the internal bleeding starts--

140
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:22,380
She'll be fine.

141
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,694

Why not?

Good.

to be the one that comes

You're dead.

170
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,644

They-- goddammit, they got her.

182
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:48,871
Calm down.

183
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,804
Don't tell me to calm down.

184
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:54,256
We'll handle this, all right?

185
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,222

00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:09,409
It's Johnny.

189
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:12,584
Listen to me.

190
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,414
OK.

191
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:15,967
We'll get all the guys together.

192
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:16,865
Don't worry.

193
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,452
We'll find her.

194
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:19,522
All right.

195
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:22,698
We'll all meet up at
the hospital 6:00.

196
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,182
LOPEZ: I put a
trace on his phone.

197
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,632
Two cars stake out the house.

198
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:28,808
I'll be there in a half
hour, 45 minutes tops, OK?

199
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:31,120
John, here's what
we're going to do.

200
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,019
It's going to take a couple
of hours to process them.

201
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:34,468
Then they'll take them
down to the lock up.

202
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,367
That's when we find out
where they've taken her.

203
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,886
And what if he won't talk?

204
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:40,750
I'll make him talk.

205
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,753
[scoffs]

206
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,207

Oh shit!

213
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:21,566
Jesus Christ.

214
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,258
What are you trying
to do, kill me?

215
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:26,123
Hey, I got you out, didn't I?

216
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:27,193
I want him, man.

217
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:28,090
I got his girlfriend.

218
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,505
I got his girlfriend.

219
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:30,403
Come on.

220
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:39,239
[car starting]

221
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:50,181

224
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:13,954
Phil.

225
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:15,680
Hey, what's up, Doc?

226
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,165
What are you in
here for this time?

227
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:20,409
It's only a couple in
the leg, one in the chest.

228
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:21,583
Man, that was a bad one.

229
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:28,866
I heard about
Kalin and Predator.

230
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,281
Predator?

231
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:31,834
The one who took
your old lady.

232
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:32,870
Where is he?

233
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:35,355
He's underground, man.

234
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,185
What does that mean?

235
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:39,428
Well, you know, when
you got an old building,

236
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:42,155
and you knock it down,
and you put up a new one.

237
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,501
But underneath it's
still the basement

238
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:47,712
and shit of that old
building, that's underground.

239
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:49,266
Which building is it?

240
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,060
Man, there's
hundreds of them all

241
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:54,443
connected underground with
basements and tunnels, man.

242
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:58,033
Yeah, but you don't
wanna go down there, man.

243
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,621
Why not?

244
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:03,590
Man, there's all kind
of weird gangs down there.

245
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,802
John, I have to take him.

246
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:09,734
All right.

247
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:11,357
Could you bring him please?

248
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,328
Hey, Doc, I got
some more bad news.

249
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:18,571
Kalin has escaped

250
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:19,986
Jesus Christ, Lopez!

251
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,781
Can't you do anything right?

252
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:25,060
Doctor, you have a phone call.

253
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:25,957
Hello?

254
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,617
Who is this?

255
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:33,068
An eye for an eye.

256
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,313
That's the way it is
in the underground.

257
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,523
That's our law.

258
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:42,974
You killed my brother.

259
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:43,975
[julie whimpering]

260
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,531
I kill your fiance slowly.

261
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:48,497
Listen to me.

262
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,673
I ask you, what
could be more fair?

263
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:52,777
Leave her out of this.

264
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:54,814
I'm the one you want.

265
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:58,542
Well, you did cost me
a lot of money today.

266
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:02,856
Let's say you bring me $250,000.

267
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,549
I'll trade you.

268
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:09,760
Her for the money, and you.

269
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:12,314
John, stall for time.

270
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:14,523
It's going to take
time to raise that much.

271
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,767
Well, I'm calling
your house at noon,

272
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,391
before we start dismembering
your pretty little girl.

273
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:23,705
Don't do it, Johnny!

274
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:26,121
I'm trying to use the phone!

275
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:32,231
Pardon me, your wife
was being a bitch.

276
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,923
You know what she said to
me when she first met me?

277
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,407
What?

278
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:39,307
[screams]

279
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,206
[laughs]

280
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,726
You son of a bitch!

281
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,245
[dial tone]

282
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:49,075
John, John, listen to me,
chances are if you meet him,

283
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:51,457
he'll kill you and
probably Julie, too.

284
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,803
Probably?

285
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:55,012
When he calls you to
set up the drop off point,

286
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,945
we'll surround the
area with a SWAT team

287
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,878
and then send in a decoy.

288
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:00,673
OK, whatever you say.

289
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:01,570
All right.

290
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:19,623
Any luck?

291
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:20,900
A lot of people
have heard of Kalin.

292
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:23,558
They're scared shitless of him.

293
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,456
I heard he's in a place
called the underground.

294
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,631
Yeah, there's an entrance
by the wash on first street.

295
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,046
OK.
I'm going to leave now.

296
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:29,943
You wait for the guys.

297
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:30,841
Come as soon as you can.

298
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:31,738
OK.

[music playing]

300
00:22:31,902 --> 00:22:35,871
No guns down here!

301
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:38,805
Maybe you should have turned
left, or was it right?

302
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,360
It's easy to get lost down here.

303
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:45,916
How about a light?

Get the other guy!

308
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,597
Where's the other one?

309
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:01,474
Get out.

310
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:03,925
Go back where you come from.

311
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:04,926
I can't.

312
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,360
Get out while you
still have a chance.

313
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,395
Wait, come back.

314
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:46,312
Did you see somebody
come by here?

[engine revving]

316
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:21,174
Where are you, gimpy?

317
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:23,176
I'm gonna come find you.

318
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,697
You better run.

319
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,527
I'm coming to get you, gimpy!

320
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:37,536
Thanks.

321
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,468
That's two I owe you.

322
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:40,849
You see that
orange pipe there?

323
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:43,058
You follow down that
way about 300 yards,

324
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:44,612
and you see a ladder
built into the wall,

325
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:46,924
and you go up that ladder,
and you'll be in elevator

327
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:48,961
You can get out from there.

328
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,479
I don't want to get out.

329
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,722
Are you crazy or just stupid?

330
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:52,999
I'm after that guy
on the motorcycle.

331
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:54,069
And Kalin.

332
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:55,070
Stupid and crazy.

333
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:56,140
Look, Kalin kidnapped--

334
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:57,556
I don't care.

335
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,766
I just don't give a shit.

336

337
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm a doctor, I've got money.

338

Don't you condescend
me, you son of a bitch.

339
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:07,117
What do you want?

340
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:15,815
How about respect?

341
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,506
Do you think you
can give me that?

Oh our friend is in
the underground now.

Apparently, he went through
a fight with the garbage can.

360
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:26,005
Put out the word,
$50,000 reward

if he's brought to me alive.

362

Don't kill him.

a bitch to suffer.

00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:42,245
Is it entertaining?

371
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:43,211
It's fun.

372
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:02,541
Oh come on now.

373
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:03,438
Watch a little bit.

374
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:06,994
And you'll like it.

375
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:10,480
[crowd cheers]

376
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:26,910
[music playing]

377
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:06,743
How much further?

378
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:10,057
About another
mile to Pasadena.

379
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,233
You can go from downtown
to Pasadena underground?

380
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:17,581
Between sewer lines,
old buildings, new subway,

381
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:20,791
old subway, I go from
here to San Bernardino

382
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:23,380
and not come up for air.

383
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,003
MAN: Tunes, tunes,
tunes, all night,

384
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:27,143
all day, all around the clock.

385
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:28,558
That's the kind
of song that makes

386
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:31,457
me want to get up and shake my
tail fathers, stretch my booty,

387
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:32,941
lick my dessert.

388
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:36,221
Is the Freebird back, the person
who couldn't fit in upstairs,

389
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:41,847
couldn't fit in downstairs, but
whose voice fits in everywhere.

390
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,021
I'm talking to all
you kiddies out

391
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:44,850
there right now,
because there's a doctor

392
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:47,025
do goody good good out there.

393
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:50,856
He's running around our own
little special playground.

394
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:56,275
And a Mr. K has an
offering of $50,000

395
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:59,658
cool cash to anyone of you--

396
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:01,315
oh I love this word--

397
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:06,872
bangers out there, who
will bring him in alive

398
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:11,359
or even slightly alive.

399
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:13,844
Listen doctor do
good, I'd like to talk

400
00:34:13,948 --> 00:34:16,675
to you for a second baby.

401
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:18,608
This place stinks.

402
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:20,644
I wonder who
does their laundry.

403
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:23,475
Don't look at me.

404
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:24,786
Shh, listen to that.

405
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,203
MAN: She is in good hands.

406
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:28,100
Really good hands.

407
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:31,172
We're running out of time.

408
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:37,040
MAN: Personally, I'd like to
get my hands on you, doctor.

409
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,214
What is that?

410
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:39,284
It's the underground radio.

411
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:31,129
[rat squeaking]

412
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:32,026
Shadow warriors.

413

[suspenseful music]

417
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:26,122
Pair of sevens--

418
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:56,497
Hey guys.

419
00:39:56,601 --> 00:40:00,846
I seen a place like this
before with big giant spiders.

420
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,744
Come on.

421
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:02,641
Shut up.

422
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,231
Where's this go?

423
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:07,819
I don't know, but
it's the only way.

424
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:09,027
I'm not going.

425
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,993
Come on, let's go.

426
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:11,098
Looks like it comes out there.

427
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,168
OK, OK.

428
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:13,652
Come on.
Don't push.

429
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:14,791
I'm coming.

430
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,655
I'm going.

431
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:19,589
[music playing]

432
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:35,881
Tommy, are you OK?

433
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:38,815
Do you need to take a nap?

434
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,749
[coughing]

435
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:47,099
Welcome to Reaganomics.

436
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:51,656
Hola, como estas?

437
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:03,253
This looks like a
third world country.

438
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:04,185
Aaron, my man.

439
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:06,049
How you been hanging?

440
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:07,016
Especially well.

441
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,189
Especially well.

442
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:11,641
Who be this?

443
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:17,129
Johnny.

444
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:18,268
Welcome to downtown.

445
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:26,484
Actually, we haven't met.

446
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:27,450
Yeah, right.

447
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:42,258
Take no offense.

448
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:44,950
An excess of spleen

449
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:59,102
This is my house, and
I didn't invite you.

450
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:13,634
I'm homeless, not illiterate.

451
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:23,057
Ernest, I can help
you get out of here.

452
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:26,095
Don't you patronize me.

453
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:29,443
I'm gonna help you, but you
get your candy ass some guilt

454
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,582
ridden give a dollar to.

455
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:32,998
Get that bleeding heart
out of my fucking house!

456
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:46,840
So what brings thee to
the nether world, my friend?

457
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:49,256
I'm looking for
someone, Kalin.

458
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:57,195
I need a gun.

459
00:42:57,298 --> 00:42:58,334
Oh you can't.

460
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:01,786
They're outlawed down
here, since the truce.

461
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:03,166
Outlawed?

462
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,996
Of course.

463
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,070
We all have our
territories down here.

464
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:12,382
We all realize that
if there were guns,

465
00:43:12,486 --> 00:43:14,730
we'd be dead within the week.

466
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:20,736
Take me with you.

467
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,605
You know, I fought with
Henry at Agincourt.

468
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:28,502
Henry?

469
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,573
The fifth, of course!

470
00:43:30,677 --> 00:43:33,990
Why, he said to me, once
more into the breach,

471
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,753
dear friends, once more
or wall the hole up

472
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:39,651
with our English dead.

473
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:44,967
Aaron, Aaron, this is
no time for war stories.

474
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,727
You know, I told you one day
that I'd deal with Kalin.

475
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,491
Now is the time.

476
00:43:52,595 --> 00:43:56,150
This is for you.
- It's lovely.

477
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:02,605
Let me come with you.

478
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:05,228
You know, I fought the
Battle of Gettysburg.

479
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:07,265
No, no, no.

480
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:10,475
Aaron, this is gonna
be real bloody.

481
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:13,789
Hey, just remember
he's got Julie,

482
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:16,688
and I'd rather not get her in
the middle of your blood bath.

483
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,208
Yeah, well, I'd
rather a lot of things.

484
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:21,210
Now you just dummy up
and do like I tell you,

485
00:44:21,313 --> 00:44:22,763
and maybe you won't get hurt.

486
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:24,523
Listen to me.

487
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:26,905
I don't know what
your problem is.

488
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:30,564
Personally, I don't give a shit.

489
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:34,326
We're going to get
Kalin my way or no way.

490
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:41,679
Hmm.

491
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:44,233
You've got a little
potential there, boy.

492
00:44:44,336 --> 00:44:48,306
Kalin controls the armory.

493
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:49,721
We'll get that first.

494
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,628
Then fare the
well, good knight.

495
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:05,530
May the puissance of thine
arms and the favor of the gods

496
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:08,636
bring the laurel
crown upon thy helm.

497
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,570
[crowd cheers]

498
00:45:20,994 --> 00:45:23,859
Made it through
the shadow warriors.

499
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:25,032
Guess what?

500
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:27,586
They have their old
pal Gimpy with them.

501
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:33,558
This is getting
better and better.

502
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:44,500
[crowd cheers]

503
00:46:10,422 --> 00:46:13,771
[shouting]

504
00:47:25,014 --> 00:47:28,397
[crowd cheers]

505
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,054
Looks like Johnny's been here.

506
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:31,434
Yeah, no kidding.

507
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:33,229
We're on the right track.

508
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,852
You know, I don't
think I like this place.

509
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:45,793
I'm sure I don't
like this place.

510
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:49,487
Here we go again.

511
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,387
[shouting]

512
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:26,179
What took you so long?

513
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:38,708
Night rats.

514
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:45,232
Looks empty.

515
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:46,095
Oh they're here.

516
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,315
Come on, come on, up.

517
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:00,558
It's fine.
Come on kids.

518
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:01,455
Inside.

519
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:16,712
Hello, kiddies out there.

520
00:49:16,815 --> 00:49:18,956
This is the Freebird.

521
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,854
You're not doing a
very good job tonight.

522
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,994
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

523
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:26,825
You see doctor do good just blew
right past the shadow warriors.

524
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:32,210
And now he's got the help of
my own favorite weekend soldier

525
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:35,144
with that little
wounded leg, GI Joe.

526
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:38,561
Oh Joe, say it ain't so,
Joe, say it ain't so.

527
00:49:38,665 --> 00:49:40,460
So what we're going to
do for the next hour

528
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:42,427
is we're going to double
everything, double the danger,

529
00:49:42,531 --> 00:49:44,464
double the pleasure, double
the treasure, double the fun,

530
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,985
because two is always
better than one.

531
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:50,125
As we pump up the volume
here and we make things

532
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:53,231
nice and hot, because the person
who brings home doctor do good

533
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:55,958
is going to get that brass ring.

534
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:58,857
Now it's time for these
hot, hot, hot tunes.

535
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:02,275
[music playing]

536
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:19,119
[shouting]

537
00:50:48,562 --> 00:50:50,702
Maybe they'll set him
free when they get back.

538
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,118
It won't matter.

539
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:54,396
They'll be long gone by then.

540
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:55,983
I'm telling you they're
only good for killing,

541
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,296
no point in sparing them.

542
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,093
I won't kill a man
if I don't have to.

543
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:04,302
This is a war zone, kid.

544
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:05,648
That's how we do it down here.

545
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:09,859
You tell the rest of them.

546
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:10,757
Oh shit!

547
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,349
[shouting]

548
00:52:23,623 --> 00:52:26,936
Not bad for a beginner.

549
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,111
How many of these games
do we have to go through?

550
00:52:29,215 --> 00:52:33,253
This is the last one
before we get to Kalin.

551
00:52:33,357 --> 00:52:34,220
Let's go.

552
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:49,994
Were you army?

553
00:52:50,097 --> 00:52:53,342
Be all you can be.

554
00:52:53,446 --> 00:52:55,068
Can I ask you something?

555
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,691
Mm-hmm.

556
00:52:57,795 --> 00:53:00,280
Why are you down here?

557
00:53:00,384 --> 00:53:03,041
My place in Malibu
is being remodeled.

558
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:04,319
Come on, Ernest.

559
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:06,148
You're healthy, intelligent.

560
00:53:06,252 --> 00:53:07,736
Surely the Army trains you--

561
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:08,737
To do what?

562
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,187
Jump out of a plane?

563
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,705
Field strip a rifle?

564
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:13,569
What does that qualify me to do?

565
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:16,503
You every fill out a
job application, Doctor?

566
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,609
Put your phone number here?

567
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:20,197
Oh, I don't have one.

568
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,371
Put your address down there.

569
00:53:22,475 --> 00:53:25,167
Gee, I don't have
one of those either.

570
00:53:25,271 --> 00:53:26,617
Thank you.

571
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,618
Next.

572
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:28,860
Still, I can't believe--

573
00:53:28,964 --> 00:53:30,345
No, you can't believe.

574
00:53:30,448 --> 00:53:33,934
You get in your BMW and
leave your gated community

575
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:35,488
and drive to your
air conditioned

576
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:37,455
office in Beverly Hills.

577
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,113
You have no fucking
idea what goes

578
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,460
on out here in the real world.

579
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:47,638
You don't know a thing about
me, what I do, or where I live.

580
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:53,816
So don't-- hey!

581
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,992
You don't have a
monopoly on pain.

582
00:53:57,095 --> 00:53:59,477
Yeah, I know you
had it real rough.

583
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:18,669
[music playing]

584
00:54:23,087 --> 00:54:24,295
Oh no, you don't
want to go down there.

585
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:35,272
Doctor do good,
oh doctor do good.

586
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:36,169
Can you hear me out there?

587
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:44,004
You see, I'm lonely tonight.

588
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:47,525
I'm feeling a little feisty.

589
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:48,802
But you're not
alone, because you

590
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:51,874
got some buddies who came
down from upstairs to help

591
00:54:51,978 --> 00:54:54,739
you in your time of need.

592
00:54:54,843 --> 00:54:56,707
Well, that's good for you.

593
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:57,984
Yeah.

594
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,089
But it's also good for
our bangers out there.

595
00:55:00,193 --> 00:55:01,401
You listening, bangers?

596
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:04,059
Because Mr. K has
upped the ante.

597
00:55:04,162 --> 00:55:05,371
Pick what's behind
door number two.

598
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:06,475
What do you see?

599
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:08,960
You see five grand a
head for any of doctor

600
00:55:09,064 --> 00:55:12,999
do good's buddies that you
bring to Mr. K. That's right.

601
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,450
The stakes are getting
higher and higher.

602
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:18,245
You know what, doctor do good,
if you're listening, baby,

603
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,385
you might be good.

604
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:21,904
But I sure couldn't
make you better.

605
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:23,803
Oh yeah.

606
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:25,736
Now what might excite the
bangers is the five grand,

607
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:32,432
but what excites me is you,
doctor do good, is you.

608
00:55:32,536 --> 00:55:35,193
[music playing]

609
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:50,416
I think we're a
little bit out numbered.

610
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:52,072
There's only half
a dozen of them.

611
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:53,108
Any bright ideas?

612
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:54,316
Yeah.

613
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,282
Let's fly.

614
00:56:02,186 --> 00:56:05,465
[grunting]

615
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:56,792
[screaming]

616
00:57:08,355 --> 00:57:09,805
Everyone OK?

617
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:10,910
We're missing Kwong.

618
00:57:13,878 --> 00:57:16,122
Maybe he got out
on the other side.

619
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:17,848
Yeah.

620
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:18,780
Come on.

621
00:57:18,883 --> 00:57:19,643
We got to get moving.

622
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:25,856
[rats squeaking]

623
00:57:48,948 --> 00:57:50,501
You know, you still
haven't answered my question.

624
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,027
Grandpa died a
hero in World War II.

625
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,270
My old man retired
after 20 years.

626
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:06,344
All my life I wanted
to be a soldier.

627
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:07,242
A lifer.

628
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:14,560
At 17, I volunteered
and did a tour in 'Nam.

629
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:22,222
I was court marshaled and
sent to prison for 20 years.

630
00:58:22,326 --> 00:58:23,189
What happened?

631
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:29,229
My commanding officer
was shot in the back.

632
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,488
This was set improperly.

633
00:58:46,592 --> 00:58:47,385
It wasn't set.

634
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:52,183
When we get out of this,
I'll put you in the hospital

635
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,150
and fix it.

636
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:55,428
I'm not going up there.

637
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,568
Why not?

638
00:58:57,672 --> 00:58:59,846
I just don't
understand it up there.

639
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,055
President of the United States
regularly breaks the law

640
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,956
and lied to the American people,
and nobody does anything.

641
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:09,373
Down here, we got good
guys and bad guys.

642
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:11,789
And it's really easy to
tell which one's which.

643
00:59:11,893 --> 00:59:13,964
Move that stuff out the way
so we can get out of here.

644
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:31,360
[crowd cheers]

645
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:38,782
Look, I'm giving you a choice.

646
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:42,648
You can fight, or you can die.

647
00:59:42,751 --> 00:59:45,720
[shouting]

648
00:59:45,823 --> 00:59:46,583
Fight.

649
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:57,973
[crowd cheers]

650
01:00:21,928 --> 01:00:23,033
Things are heating
up out there.

651
01:00:29,591 --> 01:00:31,455
Maybe you'd better
go check it out.

652
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:11,046
[crowd cheers]

653
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,541
[engine revving]

654
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:25,405
Fred is Kalin's
number two man.

655
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:31,170
In here.

656
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:33,966
Let me ask you something.

657
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:36,244
Why are you doing this?

658
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:38,004
I still owe Kalin
big time for this.

659
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:39,212
Come on.

660
01:01:39,316 --> 01:01:41,352
There's more to this than
just revenge for you.

661
01:01:45,322 --> 01:01:47,876
Do you know what beauty is?

662
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,119
Beauty?

663
01:01:49,222 --> 01:01:51,259
Beauty is when any
living thing can do

664
01:01:51,362 --> 01:01:53,813
exactly what they do the best.

665
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:57,472
The Army didn't teach me much,
but this shit I know about.

666
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,951
What the hell is this?

667
01:02:28,054 --> 01:02:30,263
Yo, it's a freak show.

668
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:33,715
Show baby.

669
01:02:33,819 --> 01:02:34,716
Hurt me.

670
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:27,113
What's the matter, cute boy?

671
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:30,496
Cat got your tongue?

672
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,119
You do like to party, don't you?

673
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:34,086
Yes, ma'am.

674
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:52,242
Let's get naked!

675
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:53,588
Outstanding.

676
01:03:53,691 --> 01:03:56,833
So let's party.

677
01:03:56,936 --> 01:04:00,043
Hey, so where's all the guys?

678
01:04:00,146 --> 01:04:04,910
It's obvious you girls couldn't
survive down here by yourself.

679
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:07,636
We have a truce
with the other gangs.

680
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:13,194
They leave us along, so long
as we invite to our parties.

681
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:15,679
We have some wild parties.

682
01:04:33,731 --> 01:04:36,631
[shouting]

683
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:08,619
So why are you
called the bad girls?

684
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:12,830
'Cos when we're
good, we're bad.

685
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:16,041
And when we're bad,
we're really bad.

686
01:06:24,877 --> 01:06:28,260
Guys, we can't hang here.

687
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:31,090
We've got to find Johnny.

688
01:06:31,194 --> 01:06:35,784
Yeah, in a bit, right after
this well deserved break.

689
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:37,165
Take a pill, Brad.

690
01:06:40,134 --> 01:06:40,997
Just relax.

691
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,894
That's it.

692
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:47,658
[crashing noise]

693
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:55,252
So, you're the guys
Kalin wants, huh?

694
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:56,736
Drugged us, bitch!

695
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:18,068
Woo-wee!

696
01:07:26,628 --> 01:07:29,528
Hey, come here.

697
01:07:29,631 --> 01:07:31,633
[grunting]

698
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:33,014
Holy guacamole.

699
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:38,847
Wow.

700
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:40,194
Look at this leg.

701
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,821
Nice butt.

702
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:50,169
[grunting]

703
01:07:54,656 --> 01:07:55,795
Why did you stop?

704
01:07:55,899 --> 01:07:57,970
I think I'm in love.

705
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,282
You have a dog?

706
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:01,870
I'd love your dog, too.

707
01:08:01,974 --> 01:08:05,288
[grunts]

708
01:08:10,914 --> 01:08:13,744
You know, you are
really sexy when you

709
01:08:13,848 --> 01:08:15,160
throw one of those spinning--

710
01:08:15,263 --> 01:08:18,577
[gasping]

711
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:45,190
Friends of yours?

712
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:46,915
No, I've never
seen them before.

713
01:08:50,022 --> 01:08:52,956
So you won't mind if
I throw them in the cage

714
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:55,890
and make them
fight to the death.

715
01:08:55,993 --> 01:09:01,758
I'd mind anyone fighting
to the death except you.

716
01:09:01,861 --> 01:09:06,038
Oh you'll see me all right,
when your boyfriend gets here.

717
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,110
You'll see me.

718
01:09:09,214 --> 01:09:11,975
[spits]

719
01:09:15,427 --> 01:09:18,499
My kind of girl.

720
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:21,398
[julie whimpering]

721
01:09:22,503 --> 01:09:24,746
That one right
there in the cage now.

722
01:09:30,511 --> 01:09:31,822
We almost there.

723
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:35,136
Listen.

724
01:09:39,105 --> 01:09:40,935
Kalin's thrown room
is right down there,

725
01:09:41,038 --> 01:09:43,524
but the armory's this way.

726
01:09:43,627 --> 01:09:44,456
You go.

727
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:45,595
I'll head to Kalin's.

728
01:09:45,698 --> 01:09:48,253
You can't go down
there on your own.

729
01:09:48,356 --> 01:09:49,150

01:14:16,693 --> 01:14:19,455
He'd tear you up.

Just crawl through the

That will take us into

01:33:31,847 --> 01:33:33,366
Say you must rip and
husk off the past.

919
01:33:33,469 --> 01:33:35,230
You ain't know jack
on how to talk trash.

920
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:36,680
Living the easy life,
driving the money car,

921
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:38,820
not knowing at all

922
01:33:38,923 --> 01:33:40,062
who the hell you really are.

923
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,408
Don't test me.

924
01:33:41,512 --> 01:33:43,997
Don't test me.

925
01:33:44,101 --> 01:33:47,967
[woman singing]

926
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:23,174
MALE SINGER: Hey yeah.

927
01:34:29,215 --> 01:34:30,630
Hey yeah.

928
01:34:36,222 --> 01:34:41,054
It's a long, long way home.

929
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:46,508
Because I know that part of
you that makes me feel wrong

930
01:34:46,611 --> 01:34:48,890
is getting for me.

931
01:34:48,993 --> 01:34:54,205
Losing battles to your
gentle addictions.

932
01:34:54,309 --> 01:34:55,103
Hey yeah.

933
01:35:03,076 --> 01:35:03,939
Hey yeah.

934
01:35:10,946 --> 01:35:13,293
These things go two ways.

935
01:35:13,397 --> 01:35:20,197
And I thought if we're together,
we'd be on the same tides.

936
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:24,373
When I lost my way I
don't believe that I

937
01:35:24,477 --> 01:35:27,273
could trust you to find me.

938
01:35:27,376 --> 01:35:28,274
Hey yeah.

939
01:35:35,315 --> 01:35:36,178
Hey yeah.

940
01:35:43,254 --> 01:35:46,154
There's a life on the silver
screen with an [inaudible]

941
01:35:46,257 --> 01:35:47,431
playing the role.
And it's a tragedy.

942
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:48,328
Everybody says so.

943
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:49,571
Everybody knows about it.

944
01:35:49,674 --> 01:35:51,055
Hey, who's that being
knocking at the door?

945
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:53,126
It's free disco charity.

946
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:54,369
Come on, woman.

947
01:35:54,472 --> 01:35:57,337
Give me the goods because
I don't want to be here.

948
01:36:00,133 --> 01:36:00,927
Anymore.

949
01:36:08,866 --> 01:36:09,660
Anymore.

950
01:36:13,077 --> 01:36:13,802
Anymore.

951
01:36:35,237 --> 01:36:36,031
Hey yeah.

952
01:36:41,865 --> 01:36:43,590
Hey yeah.
