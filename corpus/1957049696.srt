1
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:10,402
Booster ignition and transfer to
the lead reflector is affirmative.

2
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,639
AP is now in the primary
position for complete control.

3
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:19,778
On my mark, go to 50-niner.
Stop 4-7-2-2-1

4
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:24,983
Roger, throttle up. Going
2-5-0-niner, stop, 4-7-2-2-1.

5
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:31,323
This is it, no more off shore drilling.
From now on clean renewable energy.

6
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,593
Nathan should be here.

7
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:36,228
Watch the temperature Simon

8
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,297
Throttle up.
Go for main engine start.

9
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:41,533
Roger that AP,
full main engine start.

10
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,369
You know I invited him to
witness this.

11
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,872
And he didn't want to come?

12
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:56,381
He said, uh, so many worlds. So much to
do. So little done. So many things to be.

13
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,318
He's quoting Tennyson.

14
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,386
Yeah well what can be more
important then this?

15
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:03,422
Balloons.

16
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:34,886
Sir, we're all clear.

17
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,489
Let's go for the infusion.

18
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,425
Keep an eye on the monitors
for a dip in the pressure.

19
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:49,301
We're all clear for infusion. Take
the level four. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1

20
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,372
We're a go for the main
reactor start.

21
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,845
By channeling the power of
nature, our main reactor is

22
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,881
About to change how the world
consumes energy.

23
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:21,466
Get the ground line in. Johnny
come on. Let's get loaded and go.

24
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,072
Come on get in.

25
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:43,755
What's happening?
The beam intensity is

26
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:47,059
Far greater than imagined.
We didn't expect this.

27
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,729
No, you nailed it! You'll be
on the next cover of Forbes!

28
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,066
No. Something doesn't feel right.

29
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,968
That's how it feels when you're
about to change history!

30
00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:11,850
Boys.

31
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:17,789
Lewis. I want test results. Numbers
on my desk, 20 minutes Alright.

32
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:21,593
Then assemble the board because
we are taking this thing from

33
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,562
Prototype to actual energy source.

34
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:25,897
Simon, tell me the numbers
look good.

35
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:27,199
I don't know yet.

36
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:29,468
I'm sure they're fine. Listen
let's call in Senator Bain and

37
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:32,504
Why don't we call the president
because we are changing history here.

38
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:34,573
Verifying weather anomalies
in low-pressure altitudes.

39
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:35,874
Winds at 129 and climbing.

40
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,542
Why didn't we see that?
It just happened.

41
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,044
Whoa, what just happened?

42
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:41,546
Circular fluid motion of clouds.
Pressure is dropping 13 PSI

43
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:44,416
Increasing wind and 175.

44
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,752
Shit a cyclone is forming in
the gulf.

45
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,587
How big?

46
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:52,924
F5. Big. Find out if there are any vessels in
the area and get NOAA on the phone right now.

47
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:53,625
Copy.

48
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:57,729
We should think about shutting
down the reactor.

49
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,367
The reactor did not cause this.
Bad mapping caused this.

50
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,336
What's that suppose to mean?

51
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:08,640
It means that F5's don't magically appear,
okay? And they are not congered by what we did.

52
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,345
Look, it was poor planning on your part because
of the weather but we can still do this.

53
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:17,149
Okay, this reactor was built to
with stand anything. Anything.

54
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:19,050
Nathan was right.

55
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,319
We pushed the reactor too hard.

56
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,821
And you know it.

57
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,824
We're not shutting it down.

58
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:31,863
Damn.

59
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:08,800
The reactor is malfunctioning.
We've messed with Mother Nature..

60
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,635
Reporting swells of 70 feet.

61
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:12,938
Range approaching 200mph.

62
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,241
What population centers are
within a 400-mile radius?

63
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,175
Galveston.

64
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,477
What?

65
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:21,046
That's the direct path of the storm.

66
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,763
The storm is coming.

67
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,266
We gotta land.

68
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,568
It's that bad?

69
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:33,018
Hold on!
It's gonna be a hard landing.

70
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,586
Hold on tight.

71
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,740
Brace yourself.

72
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,811
Out! Out! Out! Go! Go!

73
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,829
Storms have gathered across
North America, believed to have

74
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:20,298
Been caused by the government
Apollo Station.

75
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,902
Casualties remain unknown at
this time

76
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,638
While storms continue to
spread throughout the states.

77
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,575
It is unclear at this time what this
storm is and how it will develop

78
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:35,080
Should conditions continue. This
is Ryan Johnson for Channel 3 News.

79
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,505
Get in the car!

80
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:01,406
Dad, what about the Balloon?

81
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,141
Forget the Balloon.

82
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:17,889
You okay?

83
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,124
Dad, what the hell is going on?

84
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:19,958
I don't know.

85
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,960
Storm. Came outta nowhere.

86
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:27,065
I've never seen hot air ballons
explode. I mean they exploded!

87
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,968
People exploded! They blew up.

88
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:33,204
Just calm down.
Go play your game or something.

89
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,439
Mom.

90
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,109
Johnny! Game!

91
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:39,377
Buckle up!

92
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,280
When we get home and get online.

93
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,717
Everything is gonna be fine.

94
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,391
Dr. Caprisi, we're getting
reading that are high and low

95
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:56,061
That are off the charts.
We can't shut this down.

96
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,862
What is our footprint?

97
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:00,131
1,000 square miles and growing.

98
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:02,400
How long before it hits land?

99
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,303
Days? Hours?

100
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:06,337
Minutes.

101
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,146
I'm shutting this down.

102
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,881
You don't know that's the problem.

103
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:21,586
No my chart says we ripped a hole in
the ozone. That rip keeps on going.

104
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:24,089
It won't stop until we stop.

105
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,557
Ox shut it down.

106
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:28,426
You touch that machine and you
won't even get a job at Best Buy.

107
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,095
Shut it down!

108
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:39,671
Oxford 5 7-642 beginning shut
down sequence of core on my mark.

109
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:42,540
4, 3, 2, 1. Mark.

110
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,153
My game's dead!

111
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,855
In the house.

112
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:02,560
I'll call my sister in Denver.
See what the weather is like there.

113
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,911
I'm going to check the news.

114
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,781
Good idea.
Dad the TV won't come on.

115
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:26,985
I've never seen anything like
that before. All those people.

116
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:29,621
Lights either. Honey the
electricity must be out.

117
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:30,822
I'm going to make some sandwiches.

118
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,191
I'll fire up the generator.

119
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:44,796
I'm not hungry.

120
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:45,930
You gotta eat something.

121
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,433
What do you thing happened to
him mom?

122
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,202
You think he ever made it?

123
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,106
Probably some of them.

124
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,711
I can't eat this it's stale.

125
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:04,616
The electricity has not been out
that long. Don't be ungrateful.

126
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:06,284
Come on, we have to go now!

127
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,452
What?

128
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,988
Come on! Come on!

129
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,257
Why?

130
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,994
Pack whatever you can,
as quick as you can. Let's go!

131
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,131
We need shelter.

132
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,399
Are you kidding me?

133
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,635
Just get what you can and get
in the car now!

134
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,503
Don't talk back to me.

135
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,308
Come on.

136
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:05,777
Nathan, where are we going?

137
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:08,680
The school.
There's a storm shelter there.

138
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,048
Dad, how far?

139
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:11,582
10 minutes.

140
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,986
What if the roads are blocked? What if we
can't get in? What if there is too many people?

141
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:20,258
What if you just focused on the present. What if
you just focus on what's right in front of you.

142
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,339
Nathan stop!

143
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,411
Dad, Drive faster!

144
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,936
We gotta get outta this city.

145
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,605
Look I don't know how fast this storm
is coming or what direction it's going.

146
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:08,573
You're gonna kill us.

147
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:11,676
Just everybody shut up!
I need to think.

148
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:21,419
Honey he's not gonna kill us. I know your
scared. You just gotta be quiet. Just shut up.

149
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,653
This is bad.

150
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:30,528
At this moment, what are believed to
be tornados or hurricane are causing

151
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,630
Massive distraction across
the state.

152
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,034
Look, I'm too old to be
reporting this kind of news.

153
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,002
Get me back in the studio please.

154
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:42,807
Conditions are getting worse. I've
never seen a storm this magnitude.

155
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,048
Oh god!

156
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,582
She just got hit!

157
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,156
We need to get to higher elevation.
We'll be outta the storm then.

158
00:15:58,256 --> 00:15:59,123
We'll be fine.

159
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:00,758
This is so bad.

160
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,207
Dad, this is not good.

161
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:17,875
This is not good.

162
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,243
It's gonna be fine.

163
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,410
Dad! Look!

164
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,849
Hold on!

165
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:01,986
Is everybody okay?

166
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:03,521
I'm gonna throw up.

167
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,529
Dad. Dad what was that?

168
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,631
Can we go home now?

169
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:17,502
Go home? Did you not see the
trees and the cars coming at us.

170
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:22,273
We're gonna be safe here. Okay?

171
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,275
That was some pretty sick
driving dad.

172
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,812
I don't ever want to do that again.

173
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,481
Dad. Dad what was that?

174
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,320
We're not going to be safe
in this building.

175
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,758
Severe storms batter the
Southwest United States.

176
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:44,996
The government has issued a State Of
Emergency for the following states:

177
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,431
New Mexico, Texas and Arizona.

178
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:51,002
Evacuate lowland towns and
cities as soon as possible

179
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:55,907
And head for higher ground. Flood begin to
ravage the south as millions of people are still

180
00:17:56,007 --> 00:18:00,545
Without power. An estimated
2,300 homes have been destroyed

181
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,880
as the storm continues to spread.

182
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:08,319
There's nothing left.

183
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,459
Nothing.

184
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:21,866
We're still here.

185
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:27,305
The storm was unpredicted and
the cause of it's existence is

186
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:29,941
Controversial among
meteorological experts.

187
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:35,479
Evacuation to s high elevation is strongly
advised by governmental officials.

188
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:38,149
Ssshh, I hear something.

189
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,717
Yeah, I heard it too.

190
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:40,751
What?

191
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,587
It's like a low rumble.

192
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,855
Yeah. Dad where's it coming from?

193
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,525
I'm not sure.
I'm trying to pin point it.

194
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:06,410
Where should we go?

195
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,579
I vote is to go home.
Yeah my vote's home.

196
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,718
Home. we need to go where the low pressure
held the bay, so higher elevation.

197
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,754
Oh, how about the animal preserve.
Is that high enough?

198
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:18,723
I don't know but we'll give
it a shot.

199
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,191
If we go home I can get on
the Internet...

200
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,426
Honey, there is no Internet!

201
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,695
Probably no home.

202
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,269
I can still here it.

203
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,905
I hear it too now.

204
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,808
Quick, the water's gaining on us!

205
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:12,710
You gotta drive faster dad.

206
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,579
I can see it, I can see it!
Hold on!

207
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,088
C'mon!

208
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:27,358
No honey go faster!

209
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,694
I'm going.
I'm going as fast as I can!

210
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:31,996
I think the water's past us.

211
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,435
Oh God.

212
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,805
Wait, the storm has stopped. I think we're
up above it. I think we're going to be okay.

213
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,139
We'll be fine.

214
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:51,182
I want to go home.

215
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,084
Johnny.

216
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,886
No. Why didn't he know about this? He's
suppose to know all of that science crap.

217
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:57,455
The weather.

218
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,223
It's unpredictable.

219
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:00,691
Not good enough!

220
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,130
How is your father suppose to
know Honey?

221
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,669
It doesn't even matter anymore. Everyone's
gone. My friends. My Teachers. My coach.

222
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,238
Everyone.

223
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:15,339
Johnny. Johnny quiet.

224
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,608
No. I'm not gonna shut up anymore.

225
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,744
I hear it too.

226
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:21,145
You hear what?

227
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,447
Get in the car. Slowly.

228
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,555
Okay. Alright, A little faster.

229
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:33,991
C'mon. Go go go go...

230
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,831
Its getting dark. Looks like
we're here for the night.

231
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:14,331
What are you working on?

232
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,834
The pressure was too low.

233
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:20,471
And the adiabatic cooling
must have been too great.

234
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:25,009
It's gonna get worse.
Much worse.

235
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:28,646
What like more tornados?

236
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,482
We should probably find
higher ground.

237
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:37,621
Umm, we leave the state, go North?

238
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:40,591
Quite a few big mountains.
Good ideas.

239
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:45,629
I can't believe you only
brought maps.

240
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:48,999
No documents or pictures.

241
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:51,202
And an emergency kit.

242
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,571
Let's see what you brought.

243
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:04,982
Oat bars? Almonds? Kale chips?

244
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,618
At least we are not gonna be
eating maps.

245
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:15,059
I was just grabbing things.

246
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:19,530
That's enough.

247
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,568
Okay. Let's go.

248
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,273
Can you fold that up for me?

249
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:32,910
Buckle up.

250
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:43,053
No, no, no! Again.

251
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:47,958
The particle accelerator isn't slowing
down. The storm system has it caught.

252
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,129
Some how in some kind of a feedback
loop. We can't shut it off.

253
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:53,063
We need to evacuate.

254
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:54,398
No, no, no.
We're not jumping ship.

255
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:55,666
Lewis.

256
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:59,169
We can't runaway from this.

257
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,373
Once the core melts, it's over.
There's nowhere to hide.

258
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:04,875
We won't survive the nuclear winter.

259
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,810
We have 32 hours before...

260
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:11,715
Thirty-two hours? No, no. The Apollo was
designed to feed off the earth's energy.

261
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:17,454
The magnetism natural friction tectonic
stress. The heat from their earth's core and

262
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:23,794
The storms intensity is causing a feedback
loop, the stronger the storms become

263
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:28,799
The stronger the Apollo becomes
the stronger the storms.

264
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:33,570
Both of them are acting as a cause and effectence.
But now it's like a saw blade spinning

265
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:38,842
Faster and faster. You can't grab it with
both hands. And hope, hope that you can squeeze

266
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:44,815
It and stop it. We have to find a way to
neutralize both of the causes so we can

267
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,417
Stop both if the effects.

268
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,955
No, no, no, no, no.

269
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:52,656
Make that just sixteen hours.

270
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,425
At this rate,
these readings are useless.

271
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,360
If that happens again, the core
could go critical at any moment.

272
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,262
I understand that Ox!

273
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:01,765
We have to evacuate, try to get off
the continent while there's still time.

274
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:12,476
Simon.

275
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:16,447
Nathan, thank god I got in touch
with you. Have you escaped the storms?

276
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:20,417
Yes, Mona, Johnny and I are heading
to Guadalupe Mountains right now.

277
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,124
Nathan! We have a complete core melt
down, and we can't shut down the reactor.

278
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,625
What? Slow down.

279
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:31,729
We're experiencing some weather
phenomenon. It's the Apollo Mission.

280
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:34,565
Simon, What are you talking about?

281
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:38,035
Nathan.
We are controlling the weather.

282
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,703
It's Impossible.

283
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:43,974
I'm not going to argue the validity of
this; I need to ask you some questions.

284
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:45,709
What?

285
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:50,347
Basic fundamentals of the... Flares used...
Models are adjusting and self-regulating.

286
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:51,949
Simon, I'm losing you!

287
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,786
Dammit Simon,
what did you do to my formula!

288
00:25:56,387 --> 00:26:00,591
Shit! Try and get me the
location on that signal.

289
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:01,859
Yes Sir.

290
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:09,099
What's wrong?

291
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,039
I've isolated it.

292
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:17,007
Okay good. Let me know the
moment it comes through.

293
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:18,042
Yes Sir.

294
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,987
How much further to Guadalupe?

295
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,790
Not long.

296
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:37,561
Storms continue to pound the
East Coast. Tsunamis raze Houston.

297
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:41,865
The president has issued a State Of Emergency.
Be advised, gather all belongings and

298
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,867
find a safe place to take shelter.

299
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:47,504
Well dad, sounds like it's a good thing we
didn't move to Houston like you wanted to.

300
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,442
We'll be safe on top of the
mountain though, right?

301
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,744
That's right. Perfectly safe.

302
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:58,048
We just need to get to a high enough
elevation to avoid the tornados.

303
00:26:58,248 --> 00:26:59,983
How do you know?

304
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:05,022
Once we reach the top of the mountain
there's no hurricane or tornado in all

305
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:08,292
of nature that could reach
high enough to touch us.

306
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,961
You know he'd know this if he'd
pay attention is science class.

307
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:14,465
Oh give me a break.
Mr. Latham hated me.

308
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:16,100
I'm sure he didn't hate you Honey.

309
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,369
You weren't there.
He had it out for me.

310
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:23,373
I wonder if he made it?

311
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:29,246
We'll be perfectly safe.

312
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,529
What happened here?

313
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,335
Why don't we go around them?

314
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:53,036
We've got to try and help.

315
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,506
I'm staying here.

316
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:15,859
Check over there.

317
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,844
Simon?

318
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:38,849
Nathan, thank god I got in touch with you.
I need you to get to the Apollo Station right now!

319
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,484
Are you crazy?

320
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:44,288
Look, I've been over the calculations
one hundred times, Alright?

321
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:48,725
I'm missing something, okay?
And If we don't get that core cooled,

322
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:50,994
the whole damn things going
to meltdown!

323
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:56,066
What are you talking about?
Simon? What did you do?

324
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,168
I used the Nihil Algorithm.

325
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:00,204
What?

326
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:08,745
I don't have time to justify
my actions right now.

327
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:11,148
You were right, I was wrong,
let's just leave it at that.

328
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:13,884
But I need you to get here now!

329
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:33,670
Leave it at that? Simon, do you
have any idea what you've done?

330
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:37,441
Nathan!

331
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,115
Nathan?

332
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:46,984
Nathan?

333
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:09,806
You okay?

334
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:11,675
You gotta teach me that.

335
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,944
Mom are you alright?
Oh god.

336
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:19,783
The storm is coming.

337
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,251
Get in the car!

338
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:34,765
What about the dog, Dad?

339
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:37,634
We're not taking that man's
dog with us!

340
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:46,677
How long until it gets here Nathan?

341
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:48,245
Not it, they. There's two!

342
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,179
Holy shit there's two of them.

343
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,114
Less then five minutes.

344
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,124
We've gotta get to the other side.

345
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:02,459
Dad you gotta drive faster!

346
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,628
I know! Hold on!

347
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:08,598
Honey!

348
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,167
I know! I know!

349
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:14,438
We're almost there!
We gotta get to the other side!

350
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,180
Hold on!

351
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,584
Nathan!

352
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,027
Hold on we're going in!

353
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:41,224
Everyone okay?

354
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:55,172
Two tornados. If-If the core melts,
the Fujiwhara Effect will kick in.

355
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:56,573
The Fuji what effect?

356
00:32:56,673 --> 00:33:00,110
The Fujiwhara Effect is when
two hurricanes or tornados

357
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,545
get close enough to each
other to attract

358
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,581
and form one large hurricane
or tornado.

359
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:10,954
If the core melts, conditions would be
perfect for dozens of hurricanes to spring

360
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:18,995
across of North America, and they merge.
They would create a vortex the size of Texas.

361
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:22,566
The winds of excess of 500
miles per hour.

362
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,203
It's called Hypercane.

363
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,782
How long do we have?

364
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,017
I don't know.

365
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:42,486
It could be at any time.

366
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:44,721
We'll be safe on top of the
mountain, right?

367
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:50,694
From the Hypercane, maybe.
But not from nuclear fallout.

368
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:58,034
I know that model inside and out. I just,
I have to find a way to contact the power

369
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:03,707
station and I can talk to Simon. We can
figure this one out. I know I can do it Baby.

370
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,710
It's gonna be fine.

371
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:10,647
We've got get above these storms.

372
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,868
You two will be safe here.

373
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:38,375
I need you to stay with Johnny.

374
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,343
I know knew it.

375
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:44,781
I'm going into the city. It's only a
30 minute drive so I won't be gone long.

376
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:49,753
How can you be talking about
leaving us?

377
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:55,292
I gotta talk to Simon, Alright?
I think I can help him fix this.

378
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:58,762
If I don't try I don't know
what will happen.

379
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:01,398
Just call him! Just call him!

380
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:03,533
There's no signal! Alright!

381
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:06,403
I remember there's an airlift
station a few miles back.

382
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:08,838
I gotta get out of here.

383
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:11,708
Watch your mother.

384
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:13,777
Where you going dad?

385
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:14,811
I'll be right back!

386
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,847
Mom where is dad going?

387
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:22,419
C'mon. Let's take shelter in the
Ranger's Station until he gets back.

388
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,853
Johnny!

389
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:29,192
The accelerator has reached
maximum capacity.

390
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:30,527
Roger that.

391
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:32,529
How did we loose the signal again?

392
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,664
We are reconfiguring the
satellite communication

393
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:36,866
to compensate for storm interference.

394
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:42,872
But the rising levels of radiation may
mean we cannot re-establish the connection.

395
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,646
We have to destroy the Apollo Station.

396
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:53,216
That's your plan?
That's what you go for me?

397
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,786
It's the only way to stop the
core before it goes critical.

398
00:35:56,886 --> 00:35:58,888
What are you gonna do? Are you
going to call in an air strike?

399
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:02,359
No, I'm going to redirect the
beam directly below us, okay?

400
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,861
Causing the ocean to swallow
us up.

401
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:08,999
You know I'd say that's the craziest thing
I've ever hear if it wasn't the dumbest thing

402
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:13,236
I've ever heard. It's impossible
to redirect the beam. Ok. Impossible.

403
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:18,275
Not if I reconfigure the reflector
dish by bypassing the safety systems.

404
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,443
Also impossible!

405
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:23,913
We better hope it's not.

406
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,511
Johnny! Let's go!

407
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,015
Johnny!

408
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,265
Where is everyone mom?

409
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:23,900
There should be rangers here, right?

410
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,670
Yeah, they probably went home
to be with their families.

411
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:44,621
Come on. Okay, thank god.
There you are!

412
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,761
C'mon guys, land!

413
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:00,103
Okay.

414
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:03,006
Finally!

415
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,087
Hey! Hey!

416
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,797
Unless you're a damn good swimmer,
you'd better come with me right now!

417
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:28,565
Yes Sir!

418
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,500
Come on then.

419
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,377
Get this information to command.

420
00:39:41,477 --> 00:39:42,979
Yes Sir.

421
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:45,915
You're lucky we found you when
we did Dr. Sims.

422
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:47,917
How long till somebody can get
me to the Apollo Station?

423
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,752
As soon as we finish refueling.

424
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:51,955
What about this equipment?
Can I make a phone call to them?

425
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:54,824
Negative. All communication including
new satellite uplinks are down.

426
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:57,427
We got men working on the
cell towers now.

427
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:00,430
My god. This here...
This is the center of it all.

428
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,831
That's right.

429
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:05,168
These storm patterns,
they're all centralized.

430
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:10,840
It's like they are speeding up to some
visual form like some kind of magnet.

431
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:16,646
Of course! if you can get the Apollo Station
to redirect it's beams to these coordinates

432
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:18,514
We might be able to end all
of this.

433
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:20,183
Explain.

434
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:23,720
It's the heart of the storm system.
We gotta pierce it with a beam.

435
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:27,190
You want to shine a light up
into the sky. Whoop.. De.. Do.

436
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:32,662
By concentrating the beam to the center of the
storm, where the pressure is at it's greatest the

437
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,964
two forces will neutralize
each other.

438
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:36,699
Fighting fire with fire.

439
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:39,002
Exactly! The problem is that we
don't have anyway of getting

440
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:41,137
these coordinates to
the Apollo Station.

441
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:44,741
Sir, another major storm is starting
to form right on top of us.

442
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:47,010
It should be here in 5 minutes.

443
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:49,545
It looks like your timing is
a little off soldier.

444
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:52,515
We can't fly in this but we got
to get you those cell phone towers.

445
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:53,983
Let's move it out!

446
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,961
Jesus! We just lost Richardson.

447
00:42:01,217 --> 00:42:02,652
Go, go, go!

448
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,695
Aaagh!

449
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:14,831
Hey, hey, hey!

450
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:16,466
Come on!

451
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:17,400
Aagh.

452
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,202
Come on! Come on! Come on!

453
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:24,273
Go, go!

454
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:39,756
Come on!

455
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:44,927
Come on!

456
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:51,501
Did we already come this way?

457
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:54,404
No, that was another way.

458
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:56,906
How can you tell?
It all looks the same to me.

459
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,075
Who's wearing the bars private?

460
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,577
Now I need to get you to my
guys at the cell phone tower.

461
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:05,048
If I can get you there, you can
contact the Apollo Station directly.

462
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:36,412
Run!

463
00:44:35,404 --> 00:44:35,972
Aaaaaaaaggghhh!

464
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:39,442
Admiral! Captain Wright!

465
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:52,114
This place is a wreck. It's going to
take weeks to put this back together.

466
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:56,519
Yeah, I wonder what its like
back down on the base.

467
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,997
You must be Simms.
Where's Captain Wright?

468
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,038
Before we can make nay calls, you boys
will have to climb that tower. Attach and

469
00:46:16,138 --> 00:46:18,140
configure a transceiver to
the top.

470
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:21,677
I'd do it myself but I gotta stay
here and get the generators going.

471
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:25,681
When you get to the top call me and I'll
tell you how to configure the transceiver.

472
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:27,683
Roger that.

473
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:29,852
Paul will fix this. When they have the
coordinates hits the storm with his beam and

474
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:31,487
it will be all over.

475
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:33,089
Oh my god.

476
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:39,028
It's the park. It's on fire.
My family is there.

477
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:41,764
Go, Go! I can do this myself.
I can contact Apollo.

478
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:43,432
If you have any problems call me.

479
00:46:43,532 --> 00:46:45,001
You got it. Go, go!

480
00:47:29,912 --> 00:47:31,013
Mom did you hear that?

481
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:42,591
Dad.

482
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:48,631
Johnny! Mona!

483
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,700
Nathan.

484
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:54,470
Don't you ever do that again!

485
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,671
Good to see you Dad.

486
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:21,931
Come on, we gotta get outta here.

487
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:25,167
Wait? Leave? You said the safest
place would be on top of a mountain

488
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:26,635
and we are on top of a mountain.

489
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:28,637
There's a fire and it's coming.
We got to get outta here.

490
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:31,707
Hey! Hey!

491
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:37,813
Ah! Come on!

492
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:39,281
What now?

493
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:42,685
Wait, Wait, Wait. I have a plan.
We have to go back inside.

494
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:48,524
You guys get the phones;
I'll get the radio.

495
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:55,264
Lines are dead.

496
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:58,534
Dad, there's a helicopter.

497
00:49:01,103 --> 00:49:02,438
Guys we gotta go now!

498
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:04,206
I know. I know.

499
00:49:05,908 --> 00:49:07,443
Dad, there's a helicopter.

500
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,745
I know, I'm looking for the keys.

501
00:49:09,845 --> 00:49:11,847
Uh, Dad!

502
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:15,184
Let's go.

503
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:17,319
I know where it is too.

504
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:57,446
There.

505
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:01,283
Come on.

506
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:20,836
Put on your seat belts.

507
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:26,709
Honey Go, Go!

508
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:31,480
Dad what are you doing?
Let's go!

509
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:41,624
Dad, that's supposed to start
it right?

510
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:44,960
I'm trying. Look I'm turning
on the fuel just a second!

511
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,328
Dad!

512
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:48,631
Come on. Come on.

513
00:52:58,107 --> 00:52:59,575
Put your headsets on.

514
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:09,385
Here we go. Come on. Almost there.

515
00:53:10,886 --> 00:53:11,887
Faster!

516
00:53:15,924 --> 00:53:17,559
Hurry up!
Faster!

517
00:53:38,914 --> 00:53:40,449
Everybody doing okay?

518
00:53:56,098 --> 00:54:00,135
500 mph winds will engulf
North America in 24 hours.

519
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:04,039
It will be uninhabitable and
we did this. I did this.

520
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:07,609
Simon. We've done all we can
it's time to go.

521
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:09,845
Where? Where are we gonna go?

522
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:15,017
Hey. Hey.

523
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:17,920
Hey, where the hell are you going?

524
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,622
Come, Hey!
Where the hell are you going?

525
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:24,093
They're going to die with
their families I guess.

526
00:54:25,027 --> 00:54:26,562
What about you?

527
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:29,898
No.

528
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:33,102
Never got along with my family.

529
00:54:59,428 --> 00:55:01,230
Might as well answer it.

530
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:12,307
Apollo Control.

531
00:55:12,407 --> 00:55:16,678
This is Corporal Nicholas Gentile of
the United States National Guard calling

532
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:21,850
On behalf of Nathan Sims.
I'm looking for Dr. Simon.

533
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,152
Sims?

534
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:25,487
Yeah that's right! Listen, You
have to listen to me carefully.

535
00:55:25,587 --> 00:55:31,593
He gave me specific instructions as to how to
stop this storm and shut down the core melt down.

536
00:55:31,693 --> 00:55:34,363
You gotta follow my
directions exactly!

537
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:37,065
Yeah. Yeah. Okay I'm listening.

538
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:41,270
Change the trajectory of the
beam to these exact coordinates.

539
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,371
Okay I'm ready.

540
00:55:42,471 --> 00:56:01,723
34.885931 by longitude 1 -104.02500

541
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:09,731
Ok -104.062500. I got it.
Hold on.

542
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:13,836
Ox, punch in these coordinates
to the targeting system.

543
00:56:13,936 --> 00:56:15,270
Okay Sir.

544
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:43,098
If we survive this,
is there gonna be anything left?

545
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,702
Us.

546
00:56:52,507 --> 00:56:55,878
Coordinates locked on and
ready, Simon.

547
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:57,045
Do it.

548
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:12,594
Whoa!

549
00:57:12,694 --> 00:57:15,530
Simon, he's redirecting the beam.

550
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:18,367
Does... Does that mean he
fixed it? It's... It's fixed?

551
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:20,135
It's exactly what it means.

552
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:38,747
We did it. It's clearing up.
Good job guys.

553
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:42,050
Core temperature is almost back
to zero. You tell that lovely

554
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,353
son of a bitch Nathan
I owe him one.

555
00:58:56,298 --> 00:58:59,067
Simon did it. He did it.

556
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,403
Yes!

557
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:04,973
It's fixed, yeah? Right?

558
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:05,540
Yeah.

559
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:11,046
Its over.

560
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,019
Shut down the beam.

561
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,153
Roger that.

562
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:21,390
Whoo!

563
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,931
Simon. Gage.

564
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:32,267
It's not shutting down.

565
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,836
Worse. The core is melting at
an accelerated rate.

566
00:59:34,936 --> 00:59:37,172
This doesn't make any sense.
Why isn't this working?

567
00:59:37,272 --> 00:59:41,209
Verify that we got the correct coordinates.
Pull up the satellite feed.

568
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:43,645
We still can't get accurate
satellite imagery.

569
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:45,647
Too much atmospheric interference.

570
00:59:45,747 --> 00:59:47,082
So in other words we are
still flying blind.

571
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:50,752
Yeah but we are getting the
reading of a massive storm.

572
00:59:51,486 --> 00:59:53,355
It's an F10.

573
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:56,725
The Hypercane.

574
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:26,655
Corporal, It didn't work!

575
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:30,292
Are you sure you are hitting the
exact coordinates I said to you?

576
01:00:30,392 --> 01:00:34,162
Yes, but the reactor backfired
and kicked us into overdrive!

577
01:00:44,406 --> 01:00:45,807
What is that Dad?

578
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:48,410
What's wrong?
Dad, that is that?

579
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,748
You said he fixed it.
I thought you said he fixed it.

580
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:57,819
He must have missed the center.
How could he have missed the center!

581
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:02,224
Oh my god!

582
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:03,825
Mom!

583
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:08,997
Honey!

584
01:01:23,745 --> 01:01:28,183
That's it. We need to turn the beam
directly beneath us and distroy the base.

585
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:30,252
Send it crashing into the ocean.

586
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:32,921
Simon. What? What is it?

587
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:34,990
Damn! The pistons are fused!

588
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,424
I told you it wouldn't work!

589
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:37,893
It will work! Alright!

590
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:41,563
I just need to by pass the
main hydraulics.

591
01:01:55,443 --> 01:01:57,546
Ox, Ox are you there?

592
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:00,382
Go ahead Simon.

593
01:02:00,482 --> 01:02:04,686
Okay, let me know as soon as the
readings hit 180 degrees from frying.

594
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:06,354
Roger that.

595
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,093
135.

596
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:14,930
140.

597
01:02:15,263 --> 01:02:18,400
It's working.
It's working Simon. Wait 145.

598
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,902
Come on, Come on, Speak to me.
Is it there yet?

599
01:02:21,002 --> 01:02:26,842
No, no, no. It's at 160. It's leveling
out. Simon pull it back! The reading are

600
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:28,210
off the charts.

601
01:02:28,376 --> 01:02:31,146
Hey Hold on, Hold on. Hold on!

602
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:38,486
Simon. Simon. You are going
too fast. Back off.

603
01:02:43,024 --> 01:02:44,426
I think I got something.

604
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,207
I got, I got it, I got it.

605
01:03:14,189 --> 01:03:16,191
Simon!

606
01:03:20,695 --> 01:03:23,999
Simon come in! Simon!

607
01:03:52,961 --> 01:03:54,229
The hell with it.

608
01:03:56,665 --> 01:04:00,669
Simon! Ox come on! Simon!

609
01:04:00,769 --> 01:04:02,337
Check his pulse.

610
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:32,667
No!

611
01:04:38,907 --> 01:04:43,178
Come and get me!

612
01:04:49,984 --> 01:04:52,287
No!

613
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:01,262
Oh god!

614
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:04,666
What is it?

615
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:08,336
Hold on! We are going down!

616
01:05:11,906 --> 01:05:12,941
Oh god!

617
01:05:15,009 --> 01:05:17,612
Honey, Do something!

618
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:40,435
Nathan.

619
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:44,239
Is everyone okay?

620
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:47,776
So can you fix it?

621
01:05:48,109 --> 01:05:50,512
The signal was delayed.

622
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:52,847
What signal?

623
01:05:52,947 --> 01:05:56,684
At the military base they, ah the National
Guard they said the storm would be there in

624
01:05:56,785 --> 01:05:59,220
5 minutes but it was even
less then 5 seconds.

625
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:01,256
I'm not following Dad.

626
01:06:01,556 --> 01:06:04,092
It's the same reason why our
cell phones aren't working.

627
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:09,964
So what you're saying is the storm is
affecting out communication and that's why

628
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:11,933
they can't find the eye of
the storm.

629
01:06:12,033 --> 01:06:13,635
Exactly.

630
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,136
Come on.

631
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,243
Hey Tudor!

632
01:06:24,245 --> 01:06:31,586
Gotta ask you for another favor. Do you have a
GPS tracker I can use so I can send a signal to

633
01:06:31,686 --> 01:06:32,420
the Apollo Station.

634
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,621
Yes.

635
01:06:36,157 --> 01:06:40,562
But if you're trying to pin point your location
for Apollo you're gonna need 3 of them.

636
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:42,297
Triangulate your signal.

637
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:43,765
That's right.

638
01:06:43,865 --> 01:06:45,133
Dad what for?

639
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:47,602
So that the Apollo Station
know exactly where I am.

640
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:49,537
Yeah, and why would they need
to know that?

641
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:53,208
Once they can verify the eye
they can stop the storm.

642
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:54,809
Nathan.

643
01:06:54,909 --> 01:06:57,212
Honey it's my responsibility.

644
01:06:57,312 --> 01:06:59,714
I get to the center of the Hypercane.
I send the signal out, the Apollo Station can

645
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:02,317
lock onto that signal and they
can send the beam directly there.

646
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:04,052
They won't miss this time!

647
01:07:04,152 --> 01:07:07,021
And how do you plan on getting that
close? It's gonna tear you to pieces.

648
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:08,656
I'm gonna go under it.

649
01:07:10,024 --> 01:07:16,397
Alright look, If you're gonna go under it you're
gonna need to have 1 person right here at

650
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:24,272
these exact coordinates. And somebody else
right here. At those exact coordinates.

651
01:07:24,372 --> 01:07:26,541
Both as high up as possible.

652
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:27,609
Yeah.

653
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:31,713
And that means you two.

654
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:35,483
No, no, no.
That's my family alright!

655
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,952
You're gonna have to help me.
Your military.

656
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:39,621
No, I need to stay at my post.

657
01:07:40,288 --> 01:07:42,490
What post?

658
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,859
Nathan, it's the only way.

659
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,295
We're in this together.

660
01:07:52,734 --> 01:07:55,470
Whatever your gonna do you
better do it now.

661
01:07:57,939 --> 01:08:04,312
Look, if the signal is off on their
location that's the end of you.

662
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:07,215
What did he just say?

663
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:08,516
Let's go!

664
01:08:08,616 --> 01:08:10,552
Dad, what did he just say?

665
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:16,624
The hell with it.

666
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:32,473
It's working so that you know
where I'm at at all time.

667
01:08:32,707 --> 01:08:36,477
Dad. Are you sure about this?

668
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:38,580
No.

669
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,885
Come back to us.

670
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,754
Johnny.

671
01:08:46,854 --> 01:08:48,256
I know.

672
01:08:49,357 --> 01:08:52,961
Mom. You too.

673
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:17,285
Any further word from Nathan?

674
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:22,924
Plan?

675
01:09:23,024 --> 01:09:25,960
Just keep monitoring for a
signal all right?

676
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:30,932
Pray that he's still alive and
call out the correct coordinates.

677
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,001
Copy that.

678
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:22,984
Come on be at the right place.
Be at the right place.

679
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:05,953
This is it.

680
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:28,509
The position is off.

681
01:12:32,547 --> 01:12:34,649
Nathan, why are you stopping?

682
01:12:35,516 --> 01:12:38,119
This is not the center.

683
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:38,613
Nathan come on. Nathan!

684
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:02,069
Come on. Come on.

685
01:14:10,811 --> 01:14:14,081
Still no signal. It's empty.

686
01:14:30,665 --> 01:14:31,933
Oh god!

687
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,174
Ah.

688
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:43,210
Come on.

689
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:45,680
Come on!

690
01:14:53,454 --> 01:14:54,755
I'm in the eye.

691
01:16:22,176 --> 01:16:23,978
There!

692
01:18:01,642 --> 01:18:04,411
Yeah! Whoo!

693
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:12,953
Yes! Whoo!

694
01:18:30,604 --> 01:18:32,039
Simon?

695
01:18:32,139 --> 01:18:35,776
Nathan! Nathan! It's Gage.
Simon is dead.

696
01:18:35,876 --> 01:18:37,611
What?

697
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:41,382
The core is not shutting down.
We're too late.

698
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:45,319
What is it? What's wrong?

699
01:18:46,654 --> 01:18:48,222
It needs to be shutting down.

700
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:51,625
It's too late! The core's gone critical.
We're in complete melt down.

701
01:18:57,064 --> 01:18:59,333
Gage we got to take the helicopter.

702
01:18:59,433 --> 01:19:00,401
Take our chances.

703
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:02,002
Where the hell do you think
we're gonna fly?

704
01:19:02,102 --> 01:19:04,772
Listen, you know radiation
contamination is going to

705
01:19:04,872 --> 01:19:08,943
saturate every form of the planet.
Nothing, not even cockroaches will survive.

706
01:19:09,176 --> 01:19:10,911
Yeah I'm listening.

707
01:19:11,011 --> 01:19:14,281
Gage, there's only one thing left to do.
I need you to turn the beam back on.

708
01:19:16,684 --> 01:19:18,285
Fire it back up.

709
01:19:18,385 --> 01:19:19,486
Roger that.

710
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:25,392
I need you to aim the beam underneath
the station full intensity and full power.

711
01:19:25,492 --> 01:19:26,060
Can you do that?

712
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,595
Yeah I'll try it.

713
01:19:28,295 --> 01:19:30,497
And I need you to get the
hell outta there.

714
01:19:30,865 --> 01:19:32,366
That I can do.

715
01:19:34,134 --> 01:19:36,837
Come on. Gage, Come on!
Let's go!

716
01:19:37,037 --> 01:19:38,539
Okay! Okay!

717
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:55,155
Captain.

718
01:19:56,957 --> 01:19:58,192
I need a lift.

719
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:13,173
So you just plan on shooting
it down? That's the big plan?

720
01:20:13,274 --> 01:20:16,977
No, I had them turn the beam on
and aim it beneath the station.

721
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:23,584
So what's that gonna do?

722
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:25,953
We'll see.

723
01:20:49,376 --> 01:20:52,713
So, how do I fire this thing?

724
01:20:53,947 --> 01:20:55,816
I'm no pilot but I do know
this much.

725
01:20:56,283 --> 01:20:57,618
You squeeze this trigger.

726
01:20:58,052 --> 01:20:58,686
But first...

727
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:15,235
First... Wait for the on board
guidance system is locked on.

728
01:21:16,003 --> 01:21:17,538
Now you only have one missile left.

729
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:18,973
You better hope it's enough.

730
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,676
Cause if not,
there is nothing left.

731
01:21:26,814 --> 01:21:29,083
You want me to do it?

732
01:21:29,516 --> 01:21:30,684
No!

733
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:18,632
That was awesome!

734
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:23,470
Whoo!

735
01:22:24,838 --> 01:22:27,074
You might have made a good
soldier after all.
