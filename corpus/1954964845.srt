00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:39,559
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood

3
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,111
You know it used to be mad love

4
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:44,867
So take a look what you've done

5
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:48,733
Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

6
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:51,297
I can't take it back, look where I'm at

7
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,474
We was on D like DOC, remember that?

8
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:57,370
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts

9
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:59,753
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq

10
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:02,696
I don't hate you but I hate to critique,
 overrate you

11
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,491
These beats of a dark heart,
 use basslines to replace you

12
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:08,002
Take time and erase you, 
love don't hear no more

13
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:08,728
No I don't fear no more

14
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,849
Better yet, 
respect ain't quite sincere no more

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,654
Oh, it's so sad to

16
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,927
Think about the good times

17
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:22,110
You and I

18
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,666

Now we've got problems

23
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:38,618
And I don't think we can solve 'em

24
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:41,420
You made a really deep cut

25
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:44,883
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

26
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,684
Remember when you tried to write me off?

27
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,146
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?

28
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,269
Don't you remember? 
You thought that I would need ya

29
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:55,019
Follow procedure, remember? 
Oh wait, you got amnesia

30
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,529
It was my season for battle wounds, 
battle scars

31
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:58,746
Body bumped, bruised

32
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,465
Stabbed in the back;
 brimstone, fire jumping through

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,158
Still, all my life, I got money and power

34
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:07,572
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

35
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:11,209
Oh, it's so sad to

36
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:14,230

And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

46
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:44,083
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes

47
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:46,860
You say sorry just for show

48
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,813
You live like that, you live with ghosts

49
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:52,693
You forgive, you forget but you never let it go

50
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:55,390
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes

51

You say sorry just for show

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,013
If you live like that, you live with ghosts

53
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:06,870
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

54
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:09,097
