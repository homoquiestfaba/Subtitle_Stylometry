You have the right to remain silent</font></font>

00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:42,290

00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:34,634
Because you have pocketed</font></font>

87
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:37,971
Your men have come to disturb my work</font></font>

88
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,849
I told you not to deal in the store is not it</font></font>

89
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,581
Opened in the name of someone else's home exchange</font></font>

90
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,751
Or share the risks you know the rules of the game</font></font>

91
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:50,108
I do not do small business</font></font>

92
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:55,634
You can not stop him before he came it</font></font>

93
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:53,006
I was busy making machines and to open new stores</font></font>

00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:18,657
I hung up on the way to the crime scene</font></font>

101
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,702
I do not want a friend like you</font></font>

102
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:22,953
Let me shut the</font></font>

103
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:24,872

00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,587

Thank you for sending me thank you</font></font>

Fare here</font></font>

110
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,420
Damn traffic jam</font></font>

111
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:57,467
He knelt on the ground</font></font>

112
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,282
I want to call the police arrest you</font></font>

113
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,922
Where did you go to hell in the end</font></font>

114
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,247
It has been onlookers yet</font></font>

115
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,354
Let them go away</font></font>

116
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,439
Reporters and gentlemen, please wait</font></font>

117
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:13,483
Then we will take pictures really sorry</font></font>

118
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,653
You satisfying way to get out of it</font></font>

119
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:20,448
Properly cordoned off the area, what did you just</font></font>

120
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,971
Go away</font></font>

121
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,079
You're too late</font></font>

122
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:53,982
More and more people</font></font>

123
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,546
All gathered around the</font></font>

124
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,484
Hello there</font></font>

125
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,465
You checked his identity yet</font></font>

126
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,281
We are checked his license plate number and soon there will be news</font></font>

127
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:10,873
He died just a few hours ago</font></font>

128
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,085
Between 3:00 to 5:00</font></font>

129
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:17,130
The cause of death was loss of blood</font></font>

130
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,737
Or a heart attack</font></font>

131
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,405
This is my preliminary judgment</font></font>

132
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:23,490
Young people to take some photos</font></font>

133
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,155
Car Xiuzhen come</font></font>

134
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:43,719
Also look at this</font></font>

135
00:11:44,115 --> 00:11:47,452
I told you not to address him my name at the crime scene</font></font>

136
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:50,622
Sorry car police officer loyal please have a look</font></font>

137
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:51,581
what is this</font></font>

138
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,709
Rear-end it</font></font>

139
00:11:57,587 --> 00:12:00,402
It seems true</font></font>

140
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,530
I hope he is not died because</font></font>

141
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:06,492
I tend to believe this is from the random murder</font></font>

142
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,222
A few days ago Thank you very much</font></font>

143
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:30,641
Let my men become disabled</font></font>

144
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,560
Due to the presence of its own rules</font></font>

145
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:37,418
anyway</font></font>

146
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:41,631
While we each do business but the machine is shared and engineers</font></font>

147
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:42,632
Ok</font></font>

148
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,095
But we have to solve the problem is not it turf</font></font>

149
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:48,575
Flexible point</font></font>

150
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:55,144
Shan-dong</font></font>

151
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:56,708
How the book East</font></font>

152
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,401
If you can only eat sweets toothache</font></font>

153
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,842
Do not stir up trouble</font></font>

154
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,428
I was assigned to the good management of your store</font></font>

155
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,201
Everyone has their own bottom line</font></font>

156
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,558
If you crossed that line will die</font></font>

157
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,188
But I could not even have road</font></font>

158
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,212
Steve Jobs said</font></font>

159
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:24,611
To hunger for knowledge</font></font>

160
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:27,990
I did not have capital investors</font></font>

161
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:31,326
So I'm still hungry</font></font>

162
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:35,581
Mr</font></font>

163
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:44,173
That's why he provides technical and engineers for you</font></font>

164
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:39,668
My boss magnanimous because you two are friends</font></font>

165
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,154
Slot machine business</font></font>

166
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:51,826
To compete with the bars and clubs are not the same</font></font>

167
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:54,058
What are you yelling at the big boys in front of it</font></font>

168
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,560
Tell us what you have to let us comfortable bastards</font></font>

169
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,645
I've had enough</font></font>

170
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,314
Scoundrel</font></font>

171
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,442
You're so fine you people do</font></font>

172
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,090
I still see him stare</font></font>

173
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:07,946
East book</font></font>

174
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:13,056
You just gave me some bread crumbs how also installed played a great</font></font>

175
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,749

177
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:30,761
It is the boss</font></font>

178
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,894
Can not you see we speak to</font></font>

179
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:40,041
come</font></font>

180
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:45,984
Look at this idiot</font></font>

181
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,227
Now we can the peaceful coexistence</font></font>

182
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:08,507
Continued Cup</font></font>

183
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:16,452
well</font></font>

184
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,731
46-year-old Cui Zheng Liu</font></font>

185
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,859
No bad record enemies debt litigation</font></font>

186
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,506
Obviously autopsy report</font></font>

187
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:30,279
He died of a dozen stab wounds</font></font>

188
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,072
It appears to be an amateur killer</font></font>

189
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:33,428
He just crazy</font></font>

190
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,869
But if the killer was an amateur and a bit strange</font></font>

191
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:38,850
Because without leaving any evidence</font></font>

192
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,978
Fingerprint what no footprints and no blood hair</font></font>

193
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,106
Wallet may be gone robbery</font></font>

194
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:47,233
But maybe not so much of money</font></font>

195
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,381
People will be a little small thing killings</font></font>

196
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:51,884
Briefing the end of a captain called</font></font>

197
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:53,448
it is good</font></font>

198
00:15:58,411 --> 00:15:59,183
Good Secretary</font></font>

199
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:04,813
This case is likely to be robbery and murder</font></font>

200
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:08,046
Find people with similar criminal records</font></font>

201
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:08,776
Immediately went Executive</font></font>

202
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,487
Do you support a team work</font></font>

203
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:14,406
Three cases is the same as a suspect</font></font>

204
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:16,075
What case</font></font>

205
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:19,515
July 15 Western Hills reservoir</font></font>

206
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:25,772
July 23 Boryeong Sunny Beach Motel</font></font>

207
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:27,586
As well as last night's case</font></font>

208
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,110
In these three cases are the tools of crime knife</font></font>

209
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,801
From the point of view of the length and width of the knife</font></font>

210
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:38,597
It may be the same knife is not the same knife</font></font>

211
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,308
This is the serial killings</font></font>

212
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,665
This is not the United States</font></font>

213
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,522
Korean unable to obtain firearms every murderer is committing the crime with a knife</font></font>

214
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:48,190
I was shocked</font></font>

215
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,589
There are more than 1,000 murders a year</font></font>

216
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:54,446
By your logic is half of a person for murder</font></font>

217
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,593
Are you crazy</font></font>

218
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:59,556
You think you are going blending case of other jurisdictions</font></font>

219
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,788
The murderer cares districts do</font></font>

220
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:06,229
If we do not catch him soon there will be more people killed</font></font>

221
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,148
He was too careful indiscriminate killing white</font></font>

222
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:11,130
He could attack again any</font></font>

223
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,819
You do this job too easy</font></font>

224
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:14,779
The case is not what homemade salad</font></font>

225
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:16,343
You can not just throw them together</font></font>

226
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:16,969
No</font></font>

227
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:21,119
I'm not at liberty to mix them in a</font></font>

228
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:26,249
These cases occurred in the Chungnam area a week ago</font></font>

229
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:29,064
Our informant nothing</font></font>

230
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,213
This is the intuition</font></font>

231
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,987
Go to your intuition</font></font>

232
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:39,658
Your intuition for you to do gang game room</font></font>

233
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:41,681
You are very right time</font></font>

234
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,496
Is it that they are not criminals</font></font>

235
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:48,313
Gangster and murderer not a good thing</font></font>

236
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,795
Zheng Taixi this and what is your relationship</font></font>

237
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,259
Do you too want a promotion</font></font>

238
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:03,057
My God</font></font>

239
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:07,697
I is for promotion</font></font>

240
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,773
Then promoted to arrest murderers</font></font>

241
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,299
End of presentation out of it</font></font>

242
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:17,863
We caught the murderer go</font></font>

243
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,370
I did not drive drunk myself</font></font>

244
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,456
But Mr.</font></font>

245
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,750
With brothers back</font></font>

246
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:30,688
It is the boss</font></font>

247
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,765
Yes, Mr. President</font></font>

248
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:48,884
Xu Shandong is a bit reckless but he is a smart man</font></font>

249
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:51,230
He will not be in trouble</font></font>

250
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,983
Yes, do not worry</font></font>

251
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,865
good night</font></font>

252
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:30,644
I am sorry</font></font>

253
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,355
Slippery road</font></font>

254
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,325
It looks okay you go</font></font>

255
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:46,493
what</font></font>

256
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,204
But after all, I hit you</font></font>

257
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:50,873
I'm okay you can go</font></font>

258
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,001
Do you really all right</font></font>

259
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,399
Yes, all right</font></font>

260
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:04,011
Asshole</font></font>

261
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:22,675
hateful</font></font>

262
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,325
what happened</font></font>

263
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,938
who are you</font></font>

264
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,919
come</font></font>

265
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:50,696
Who Where</font></font>

266
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,384
The man is not Xu Shandong</font></font>

267
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,512
Never seen him</font></font>

268
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:18,223
Is the boss Xu Shandong</font></font>

269
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:20,726
He is not a gang of people</font></font>

270
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:23,228
His attack but not without feeling cold</font></font>

271
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,731
Feel the difference</font></font>

272
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:30,110
We're in there who want to kill you</font></font>

273
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:31,361
Give me that</font></font>

274
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:37,618
It was too dark to see clearly</font></font>

275
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,746
Out</font></font>

276
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:41,893
To find it anyway</font></font>

277
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,457
Be careful</font></font>

278
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,167
We are friends</font></font>

279
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:50,089
excuse me</font></font>

280
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,528
Patients look really comfortable ah</font></font>

281
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:53,884

00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:55,844
I brought you a box of Red Bull</font></font>

00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,515
I heard that you were stabbed</font></font>

284
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:01,704
I received a hospital phone</font></font>

285
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:05,396
You must have felt very ashamed of it</font></font>

286
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:07,919
After all, you've got a gangster</font></font>

287
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,257
From each other after all, you're a cop</font></font>

288
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:14,530
The police too incompetent</font></font>

289
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:17,741
So model citizen ever accident</font></font>

290
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,326

00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:34,862
Maybe I can catch him faster</font></font>

00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:35,592
is it</font></font>

296
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:39,450
To bet on it</font></font>

00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:42,745

Well I do not mind close to the point</font></font>

00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:59,637
Last night, I stumbled injured</font></font>

301
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,522
Well last night</font></font>

302
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:12,275
You have to go where you walk in and see</font></font>

303
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:17,176
Where unlucky bastard stumbled fell out so many stab wounds</font></font>

304
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:10,166
Zhang Dong book is black Mercedes car license plate 3849 pairs it</font></font>

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,309
Rear-end</font></font>

308
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:31,542
White car</font></font>

309
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,358

Sit down</font></font>

313
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:52,709
no need</font></font>

314
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:56,212
Too hard to endure I can not see you</font></font>

315
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:01,885
What happens next</font></font>

316
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,972
The ink is not dry on the contract you suddenly attacked</font></font>

317
00:28:07,348 --> 00:28:08,391
what do you want me to do</font></font>

318
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:13,375
I now have a lot of brothers crippled</font></font>

319
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,857
The hospital bills to pay some compensation</font></font>

320
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,380
And then hand over those that shop and flagship store of the provincial security</font></font>

321
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:24,032
I'll compensate you brothers</font></font>

322
00:28:25,783 --> 00:28:26,305
Those who do shop</font></font>

323
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,829
That is what you plan to do</font></font>

324
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:36,461
East book</font></font>

325
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,507
If I really dry</font></font>

326
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,345
Do you still alive.</font></font>

327
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:48,848
Think about it</font></font>

328
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,997
I am also very curious</font></font>

329
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:54,792
Who would do this to you</font></font>

330
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:57,899
I am leaving</font></font>

331
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:00,380
Really embarrassed</font></font>

332
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,926
A gangster was stabbed me if I would rather commit suicide</font></font>

333
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:10,411
I believe I gave two people deal with this case</font></font>

334
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:13,143
I will break the breath of these cases</font></font>

335
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,917
How do not you just leave request</font></font>

336
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:18,816
Manpower in this sector is not very enough</font></font>

337
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:21,673
Why are you going to clean up someone else's mess</font></font>

338
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:23,675
Secretary This is a big case</font></font>

339
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,781
The other on a broken are broken</font></font>

340
00:29:25,781 --> 00:29:28,742
Like long tail train column</font></font>

341
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:30,494
I'm furious</font></font>

342
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:38,147
A witness has survived in the attack</font></font>

343
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:41,463
Witnesses take the initiative to come to us yet</font></font>

344
00:29:50,264 --> 00:29:50,952
Zhang Dong book</font></font>

345
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:53,913
What books do Zhang Dong</font></font>

346
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:57,855
A few days ago he was stabbed</font></font>

347
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:01,066
Do two hours of surgery barely survive</font></font>

348
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,213
Listen to what you're saying</font></font>

349
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,194
Think</font></font>

350
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:08,532
What kind of fool would promote a gangster attack it</font></font>

351
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,638
The killer is not a gang of people</font></font>

352
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:14,183
I'm sure he's a serial killer</font></font>

353
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:15,247
To shut up</font></font>

354
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,690
It was a gang case I will be assigned to deal with two teams</font></font>

355
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,299
I warn you not to get involved</font></font>

356
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:26,905
Out</font></font>

357
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:30,199
Save it, do not cover him</font></font>

358
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,307
Now is not the time</font></font>

359
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,248
What you defend him</font></font>

360
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:38,353
What else is</font></font>

361
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,418
You are a bastard</font></font>

362
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:47,634
Even if you are right</font></font>

363
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,783
But the book is Zhang Dong victims</font></font>

364
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:52,680
You can apply for an arrest warrant to do</font></font>

365
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,724
Or go directly to arrest him right</font></font>

366
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,434
How many crimes he committed</font></font>

367
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:01,085
We want to catch him he toppled</font></font>

368
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:03,462
He is about to explode</font></font>

369
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:06,402
If we do nothing he would kill the murderer</font></font>

370
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:08,425
There are three cases we did not catch the murderer</font></font>

371
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:10,240
Zhang Dong how can he find books</font></font>

372
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,408
He is not a gangster police</font></font>

373
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,350
Let his men go is not a personal thing</font></font>

374
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,538
And the book saw Zhang Dong</font></font>

375
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:23,440
The murderer's face</font></font>

376
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:31,302
Out</font></font>

377
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,889
Your words unjustified</font></font>

378
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:36,453
Out</font></font>

379
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:52,907

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,394
I have to work hard to make money</font></font>

383
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,883
Why is so important to the baby's birthday</font></font>

384
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:11,801
I'm exhausted</font></font>

385
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:15,388

00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,914
Narrow nose</font></font>

393
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:58,473
Big mouth than the nose</font></font>

394
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,564
Very close</font></font>

395
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,408
You should not have children.</font></font>

396
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,641
It's not his fault</font></font>

397
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,169
Find him before the police</font></font>

398
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,191

00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:09,646
Everyone should stay</font></font>

Where is the boss</font></font>

405
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:14,713

Tell me everything I would look at another way</font></font>

416
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:54,962

Since you bought my boss I'm no threat to you, right</font></font>

418
00:36:03,178 --> 00:36:05,493

00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:07,245
That hurt your people</font></font>

420
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:09,872
An ax murderer</font></font>

421
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:14,064
He bit strange</font></font>

422
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:16,421
And other psychiatric patients with different</font></font>

423

What are you talking about</font></font>

425
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:27,077
Why else do you think he wants to provoke you</font></font>

426
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:37,755
Most psychiatric patients murdered girl</font></font>

427
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:40,007
Or weaker than their people</font></font>

428
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:41,884
But there is no law to kill this fool indiscriminate white</font></font>

429
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:45,637
If we do not find him soon there will be more people killed</font></font>

430
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:49,495
You people in the end what is the problem</font></font>

This is a win-win thing</font></font>

433
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:58,254
I will take him to let him stand trial</font></font>

434
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:03,989
and then</font></font>

435
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:06,971
Without an end</font></font>

436
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,870
that's all</font></font>

437
00:36:58,254 --> 00:37:00,486
Let him sit in a hole</font></font>

438
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:14,062
The country's largest luxury casino built in</font></font>

439
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:18,191
This skyscraper penthouse</font></font>

440
00:37:18,274 --> 00:37:20,777
The entire area around the building we Zeus</font></font>

441
00:37:20,777 --> 00:37:23,592
Will become the most popular place in town</font></font>

442
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:27,825
Enough of this nonsense I hear this place has been abolished</font></font>

443
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:28,972
hateful</font></font>

444
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:35,750
Those who lined up to buy pre-construction are gone</font></font>

445
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:39,775
Investors naturally delay does not give money</font></font>

446
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,634
You happen that afterwards was full of strange rumors</font></font>

447
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:48,826
Chungju area is another problem</font></font>

448
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:52,225
Xu Shandong men are entering our site</font></font>

449
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:54,373
I have not found him yet</font></font>

450
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:59,294

451
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:00,879

00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:06,969
Where is the car now</font></font>

455
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:08,387
We brought back</font></font>

456
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,995
A few days ago there was a murder in Sintanjin</font></font>

457
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:13,955
and this</font></font>

458
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,208
Discarded or lost</font></font>

459
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,628
They found that at three kilometers outside the car</font></font>

460
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:27,948
Save it</font></font>

461
00:38:28,428 --> 00:38:29,095
It is the boss</font></font>

462
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:36,874
Hello there</font></font>

463
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:38,459
My book is Zhang Dong</font></font>

464
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,651
What a surprise</font></font>

465
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:46,279
You know murder Sintanjin do</font></font>

466
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:47,780
what happened</font></font>

467
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:50,700
That bastard is dry</font></font>

468
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:52,118

469
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:56,967
How did you know</font></font>

470
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,502
We found his car in there</font></font>

471
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:07,425
My game I call the shots</font></font>

472
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:11,304
I came here risking their lives</font></font>

473
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:15,370
Then someone came and grabbed my ankle</font></font>

474
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:19,103
What I can do I can only put his arm cut off</font></font>

475
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:20,918
I can not cut off his ankle</font></font>

476
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,463
But after a gang of guys destroy the reputation</font></font>

477
00:39:24,755 --> 00:39:27,257
Disappeared</font></font>

478
00:39:28,258 --> 00:39:29,301
brothers</font></font>

479
00:39:29,656 --> 00:39:33,243
Whoever provoke me share the responsibility</font></font>

480
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:37,205
Reputation is everything a gang</font></font>

481
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,793
I'll chop him</font></font>

482
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,358
Made public</font></font>

483
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:48,737
You are telling a cop you want to kill it</font></font>

484
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:51,657
We do it is legal not allowed</font></font>

485
00:39:51,698 --> 00:39:54,993
A bad person will catch the bad guys do another</font></font>

486
00:39:55,098 --> 00:39:56,224
No</font></font>

487
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:01,417
Two bad guys will catch the worst person</font></font>

488
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:06,922
This is his car keys</font></font>

489
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:14,722
You do not treat me as a cop it</font></font>

490
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,830
I can arrest you immediately</font></font>

491
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:21,583
Why can not</font></font>

492
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,357
You caught him more than I would like</font></font>

493
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:37,411
I will provide manpower to pay</font></font>

494
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:40,038
Share Information</font></font>

495
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,062

00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:44,752
That in the end it</font></font>

497
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,150
He put it into two halves</font></font>

498
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:49,527
Who grabbed his disposal who would</font></font>

499
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,511
So if I left him to catch the proceedings</font></font>

500
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:57,243
If you catch him you buried him yet</font></font>

501
00:40:58,348 --> 00:41:00,017
Deal if you have so much confidence, then</font></font>

502
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:12,050
Well, it's a deal</font></font>

503
00:41:13,343 --> 00:41:15,491
You will regret this</font></font>

504
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:24,124

00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,315
35-year-old</font></font>

506
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:21,330
This guy is pretty handsome</font></font>

507
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:30,068
I can not see dark rain</font></font>

508
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:32,591
Use this to keep in touch</font></font>

509
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:39,911
Gangs and police join forces arrested devil</font></font>

510
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:41,788
This is so exciting</font></font>

511

Gangs and police join forces arrested devil</font></font>

515
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:07,272
We can not draw up a contract</font></font>

516
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:15,592
I give you with high-tech recording it</font></font>

517
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:19,763
hateful</font></font>

518
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:28,042
This villain to use his brains</font></font>

519
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:32,943
That's why I do not believe sliver</font></font>

520
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:52,734
I was too tolerant of you.</font></font>

521
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:54,256
Listen bastard</font></font>

522
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:58,927
Once this is something I'll beat you up first scoundrel</font></font>

523
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:05,288
He also stabbed Zhang Dong book</font></font>

524
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:09,396
He is Sintanjin case behind what this means</font></font>

525
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:11,482
If we act according to my way</font></font>

526
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:13,796
Kexin fell swoop we detected five cases</font></font>

527
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,655
35-year-old male of average height</font></font>

528
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:21,658
He only during the night of his murder from the point of view of the perpetrators mode</font></font>

529
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:25,225
Not affect the position and only with a knife</font></font>

530
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:26,038
This is the two knives in a</font></font>

531
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:29,896
Preparation of a knife or stick a knife ready to commit crimes</font></font>

532
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:33,024
So far no other clues</font></font>

533
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:40,552
We will catch him</font></font>

534
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:39,572
I made a deal and police</font></font>

535
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,617
Of course, we will not tell Secretary</font></font>

536
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:44,390
How can we trust the police do</font></font>

537
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:46,120
How can we believe that gangs do</font></font>

538
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,518
Who believe</font></font>

539
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:50,145
We need manpower to catch the murderer</font></font>

540
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:52,543
This is not the case that we can handle their own</font></font>

541
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,087
We told the director it</font></font>

542
00:43:54,087 --> 00:43:55,401
and then</font></font>

543
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,111
Crime Unit will be involved</font></font>

544
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:00,552
Media involved to take away all the glory</font></font>

545
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,992
Not only that Secretary Zhang Dong book protection</font></font>

546
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:06,599
This is the only way to solve the case</font></font>

547
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:09,540
The Secretary is a mess</font></font>

548
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:13,544
Zhang Dong books have seen his face in his car</font></font>

549
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:15,462
Only his portrait painting is not enough</font></font>

550
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:17,756
We need to fingerprint and DNA</font></font>

551
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:20,968
We find the use of gang murderer</font></font>

552
00:44:21,176 --> 00:44:23,074
Then we took him to intervene</font></font>

553
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:26,932
I will use them and then they finished behind</font></font>

554
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,674
We are also citizens pay taxes</font></font>

555
00:44:40,404 --> 00:44:42,656
Let us for once police support</font></font>

556
00:44:48,016 --> 00:44:50,873
From the outside it like a disused warehouse</font></font>

557
00:44:51,144 --> 00:44:53,938
But tens of thousands of gaming machines are manufactured here</font></font>

558
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:55,753
And then sent around the country</font></font>

559
00:44:55,753 --> 00:44:56,962
Scoundrel</font></font>

560
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:07,181
We'll find some clues</font></font>

561
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:10,934
His hair may be even his fingerprints gas row</font></font>

562
00:45:11,414 --> 00:45:13,687
We must not be found</font></font>

563
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:15,752
We'll search every inch of the place</font></font>

564
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:17,462
let us start</font></font>

565
00:45:18,776 --> 00:45:21,507
Put all the dirty work left to Zhang Dong simple book</font></font>

566
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,490
We all current cases are combing again</font></font>

567
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:27,931
This is Sintanjin murder monitor screen</font></font>

568
00:45:28,014 --> 00:45:29,244
His unique mode</font></font>

569
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:32,706
So far he has used a vehicle in all murder</font></font>

570
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:35,313
He elusive elusive</font></font>

571
00:45:36,794 --> 00:45:41,694
We know that everywhere yet solved crimes but certainly there are other cases</font></font>

572
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,301
Do not forget that from the perspective of the serial killer case</font></font>

573
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:46,178
If you find any information to report to me</font></font>

574
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:48,013
He is a ticking time bomb</font></font>

575
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,913
Look at the case in other regions could explode at any place</font></font>

576
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:53,811
Do not swagger</font></font>

577
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:54,812
Okay</font></font>

578
00:45:55,145 --> 00:45:56,292
Good good sir</font></font>

579
00:46:02,423 --> 00:46:05,260
We will solve the case after locking gang</font></font>

580
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:06,281
Cleanly</font></font>

581
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,723
Ultimately up to us to seize this murderer</font></font>

582
00:46:12,475 --> 00:46:14,561
In that we get rid of it before it Xu Shandong</font></font>

583
00:47:12,118 --> 00:47:13,098
Scoundrel</font></font>

584
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:19,354
Are you crazy</font></font>

585
00:47:19,897 --> 00:47:21,502
What are you doing here</font></font>

586
00:47:22,795 --> 00:47:24,088
In the end what you want</font></font>

587
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:25,694
I'm waiting for you</font></font>

588
00:47:27,905 --> 00:47:29,052
I think you hurt my back</font></font>

589
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:31,022
You should not scare me</font></font>

590
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:32,493
I was shocked</font></font>

591
00:47:33,786 --> 00:47:34,641
I want to drink too</font></font>

592
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:41,439
So comfortable</font></font>

00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:42,857

00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:45,401
what is this</font></font>

596
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:47,695
It is nothing special</font></font>

597
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:49,927
I found some hair and blood</font></font>

598
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,220

This is very strange murderer</font></font>

606
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:27,068
He left the weapon to us</font></font>

607

Murder and disappearance maritime police</font></font>

Now dead gangster</font></font>

00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,165
What would you do</font></font>

611
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:44,586
What should we do</font></font>

612
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:47,401
Do you have a mouth words to speak ah</font></font>

613
00:48:47,505 --> 00:48:51,405
Xu Shandong's case to the Second Team</font></font>

614
00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:52,865
They will investigate</font></font>

615
00:48:53,115 --> 00:48:54,053
What are you doing</font></font>

616
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:57,849
Do not stare at the display</font></font>

Look for evidence to solve the case</font></font>

I just got the results</font></font>

628
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:22,644
I do not believe in that</font></font>

629
00:49:22,686 --> 00:49:24,459
Come tell me what</font></font>

630

In addition to other people known to the victim in</font></font>

635
00:49:36,158 --> 00:49:37,785
This should not be ah</font></font>

636
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,286
You have to correctly detect it</font></font>

637
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:40,412
nobody else</font></font>

638
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:42,143
But that is not a problem</font></font>

00:49:42,227 --> 00:49:43,957
Out of some bad things</font></font>

640
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,854

This will be officially classified as a serial killer</font></font>

A policeman and a gangster This is what you are doing</font></font>

For me to kill him</font></font>

00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:25,851
I believe a gang is my fault</font></font>

664
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,001
You believed in me</font></font>

665
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:32,691
Fool would show Xiaopodupi</font></font>

666
00:51:33,442 --> 00:51:35,027
Nothing has changed</font></font>

667
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:37,467
We'll catch him</font></font>

668
00:51:38,009 --> 00:51:38,697

Since July this year, the region's murder</font></font>

00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:06,412
It has been confirmed as a serial killer</font></font>

675
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:12,189
The transfer of these cases to the police Crime Unit with the Cheonan joint investigation</font></font>

676
00:52:12,252 --> 00:52:15,734
So that these cases are no longer stagnant</font></font>

Murder cause of action in each district police station processing</font></font>

00:52:22,616 --> 00:52:27,934
With new hope to solve the case</font></font>

680
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:32,209
I hope this ordeal will end residents to restore calm life</font></font>

681
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:35,149

Let me kill him</font></font>

If you accept the death penalty in the absence of evidence to the</font></font>

1175
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:16,312
That's murder</font></font>

1176
01:36:16,834 --> 01:36:21,568
The real demons are those who look kind of criminals</font></font>

1177
01:36:22,297 --> 01:36:24,883
Think about the creator and executor of the law as</font></font>

1178
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:27,261
You really do have this right</font></font>

Objection, Your Honor</font></font>

1185
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:00,878
The prosecution did not provide any evidence in this trial</font></font>

1186
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:03,568
Prove my client to have any contact with the knife</font></font>

1187
01:37:03,881 --> 01:37:06,383
Not imply that the knife belonged to him</font></font>

1188
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:07,259
Yes, you are right</font></font>

1189

At least up to now is</font></font>

1191

Your Honor, we ask a witness to appear in court next</font></font>

01:38:55,868 --> 01:38:57,035
I've had enough</font></font>

01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:22,936
I swear the evidence I shall by Almighty God that the truth should be</font></font>

1217
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:26,794

1218
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:32,029
Your Honor</font></font>

1219
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:37,034
Prosecution witness was a gang leader wanted by</font></font>

1220
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:39,724
Accused of several serious crimes</font></font>

1221
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,976
He is a suspect in other cases</font></font>

1222
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:45,084
It does not affect him to testify</font></font>

1223
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:46,085
I agree</font></font>

1224

How do you prove that the defendant stabbed the person you are</font></font>

1226
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:03,560
I like such people are often stabbed</font></font>

1227
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:07,710
Before they were buried, I will not forget what they look like the</font></font>

After I was stabbed</font></font>

Find someone immediately drew this sketch</font></font>

1231

Just after the attack</font></font>

1236
01:40:40,764 --> 01:40:42,453
Witness a gang boss</font></font>

1237
01:40:42,516 --> 01:40:45,498
He stabbed his normal</font></font>

1238
01:40:45,769 --> 01:40:49,189
Because he could be treated for stab wounds others</font></font>

1239
01:40:50,774 --> 01:40:53,610
He violated the rights of the accused blasphemy law authority</font></font>

1240
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,300
Damn that fool so many words</font></font>

1241
01:40:56,363 --> 01:40:57,260
lawyer</font></font>

1242
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:57,698
witness</font></font>

1243
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:00,242
If your family was killed in the same way</font></font>

1244
01:41:00,325 --> 01:41:01,931
You will say it</font></font>

1245
01:41:02,432 --> 01:41:03,912
Rights of the accused do</font></font>

1246
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:05,894
How he deserves the right to do</font></font>

1247
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:09,334
That bastard to kill for pleasure</font></font>

1248
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:13,151
I am also a bad guy but he should not be alive</font></font>

1249
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:14,840
Evidence it</font></font>

1250
01:41:16,216 --> 01:41:17,426
I show you</font></font>

1251
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:33,067
That night he hit my car forced me to get off the view</font></font>

1252
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:36,111
Then next to me nudged me twice</font></font>

1253
01:41:36,862 --> 01:41:39,656
After a struggle he stabbed me in the chest</font></font>

1254
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:44,182
I tried to grab his knife to the finger</font></font>

1255
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,478
If I were an ordinary person I would have died on the spot</font></font>

1256
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:52,023
His clothes off</font></font>

1257
01:41:52,461 --> 01:41:53,816
I stabbed him in the left chest</font></font>

1258
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:55,818
He should have a wound there</font></font>

1259
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:06,433
Then check his hand you will find a lot of scars</font></font>

1260
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:10,500
Those who use the tool will be minor cuts in the assassination of others</font></font>

1261
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,876
It will damage your fingernails</font></font>

1262
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:15,484
At last</font></font>

1263
01:42:18,987 --> 01:42:20,572
That bastard wrote this</font></font>

1264
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:25,285
His handwriting analysis you will find a match</font></font>

1265
01:42:26,558 --> 01:42:28,789
FYI Xu Shandong is my friend</font></font>

1266
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:34,899
Xu Shandong and his assistant died</font></font>

1267
01:42:35,546 --> 01:42:37,381
I feel very sorry for Woosung</font></font>

1268
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:39,571
But if Jiang Jing Xu everything shake out</font></font>

1269
01:42:40,551 --> 01:42:42,219
We can say is dry Woosung</font></font>

1270
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:55,503
The defendant had an extremely violent</font></font>

1271
01:42:56,546 --> 01:42:58,047
Contempt for human life</font></font>

1272
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:02,760
As well as victims of suffering</font></font>

1273
01:43:03,449 --> 01:43:08,057
Weigh the crimes he deserves to give judgment</font></font>

1274
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:27,243
Thank you sir</font></font>

1275
01:43:10,143 --> 01:43:12,937
Therefore, the defendant Jiang Jing Xu</font></font>

1276
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:16,608
Sentenced to death</font></font>

1277
01:43:27,598 --> 01:43:28,786

01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:31,810
salute</font></font>

1279
01:43:49,661 --> 01:43:52,998
Our boss came to greet him</font></font>

1280
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,501
Good afternoon Boss</font></font>

1281
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:56,854
I have one condition</font></font>

1282
01:44:57,792 --> 01:44:58,459
What conditions</font></font>

1283
01:44:59,356 --> 01:45:01,671
I put him in the same prison in</font></font>

1284
01:45:28,448 --> 01:45:30,825
We played the game with three lives</font></font>

1285
01:45:31,013 --> 01:45:32,160
We have to end it</font></font>
