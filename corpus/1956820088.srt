We are worried you spend
too much time at home.

Yes, honey,
I think Dan would agree

that you're not going
to meet anyone your own age

Oh, there's an idea. Paul!

85
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,076
That's a great idea
because all the girls

00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,694
It's Dan.

177
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,964
Hey.

178
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,869
Hi, so, uh, I didn't break
your nose or anything?

179
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:33,374
[chuckles] No... I wish.

180
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,343
I just have
a hyperactive immune system,

181
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,012
I'm practically deformed.

182
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,881
Okay, try not
to describe yourself

183
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,449
as being deformed tonight.

184
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:44,318
What's tonight?

185
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,355
Dan, I, I hate you.

186
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,057
You said you wanted
to meet girls,

187
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,492
- I got you a Valentine's date.
- No, no,

188
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,160
that's not what I said.

189
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:56,830
I said I, I can't,
I can't meet girls.

190
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,866
- Well, now you can.
- Oh, my God.

191
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,934
What, what's going on?

192
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,268
Oh, my God.

193
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,237
Dude, stop stressing.

194
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,239
- Oh, my God.
- It's going to be fine.

195
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,307
You're going to kill it.

196
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,843
- Shit.
- [Max sighs]

197
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,512
You know what I mean.

198
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,481
So, I'm, like, really feeling
your cologne right now.

199
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,952
[laughs] Well,
it's compliments to this guy.

200
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:21,755
[chuckles] It's, it's just,
it's just Arm & Hammer.

201
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:23,891
Like the baking soda?

202
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:27,962
You know, I don't normally
set people up,

203
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,064
but, uh, I'm not going to lie,

204
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,733
I think you and Max
will be pretty bomb together.

205
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,835
Wait, what?

206
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,804
<i>Bonjour</i>, lady and gentlemens.

207
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:40,040
Happy Valentine's Day,
can I start any you off

208
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,842
with a cold beverage tonight?

209
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,810
You know what?

210
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,345
I got these two.

211
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,047
- Dan.
- [girl] Wait.

212
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,783
[waiter] What about
one of our milkshakes?

213
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,985
[girl] I can't have that.

214
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,920
- [waiter] Milk?
- Calories.

215
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:57,458
All right,
two diet sodas, extra ice.

216
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,459
Thank you.

217
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,262
[soft music playing
in background]

218
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,830
[phone typing]

219
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,166
So... [chuckles] Erica...

220
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,838
that's a really strong name.

221
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:13,807
Um, is it, is it, uh, Filipino?

222
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,043
I'm Cuban.

223
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,149
Oh, I, I forgot,
I made you something.

224
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,550
I hope this isn't weird,

225
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,219
I, I don't really think
it's that weird.

226
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,955
You made me a napkin?

227
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,858
[chuckles] No, it, it looks
like a napkin, kind of, yeah.

228
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,894
But, uh, it's actually
a handkerchief, and if you,

229
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,030
if you cry,
you can use it to wipe,

230
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,232
or if you need to blow
your nose, um,

231
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,368
or all of the above, if, if
they're happening at the same,

232
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:42,536
same kind of time and...

233
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:45,806
Thanks.

234
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:52,813
Look, um... [chuckles]
I, I know you didn't,

235
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,449
you didn't have
to come here tonight.

236
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,554
But you, you seem really nice,
and this is kind of,

237
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:05,627
like, my first Valentine's
Day thing like this,

238
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,860
so...

239
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:09,296
thank you.

240
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,499
- [man] I'm making a scene?
- [woman] Yes.

241
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,934
- You want me to make a scene?
- [glass smashing]

242
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,869
You're an asshole, Craig! [sobs]

243
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:22,276
Erica.

244
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,913
What's hanging, sexy?

245
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,616
[inhales]

246
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,552
[blows]

247
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,622
Hold up.

248
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:38,092
You're the kid that kills people
with his pretty face?

249
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,393
Uh, no, that's...

250
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,297
Oh, shit, you are.

251
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,598
Uh.

252
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:47,234
Come on, let me see.

253
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,971
- Craig.
- Two diets and, um,

254
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,274
my manager is
asking you to leave.

255
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,644
- Your manager can suck my sack.
- Totally.

256
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:58,212
[eerie music]

257
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,347
- Uh.
- [glass clattering]

258
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,116
- What the hell, man?
- Sorry, sorry.

259
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,618
- It's fine, it's fine.
- No, this ain't cool.

260
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:04,652
Okay, yeah, I'll get,
I'll get someone.

261
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:05,919
No.

262
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,188
You did this.

263
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,991
You clean it up.

264
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,126
[Erica] Craig.

265
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,528
Okay, but with, with what?

266
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,297
Start with whatever
this shit is.

267
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,067
[Max sighs]

268
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,171
- Here, let me help you.
- [hat thuds]

269
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,507
- [people gasping]
- Oh, my God. Craig, stop it!

270
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,709
[Max grunts]

271
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:30,043
[manager] Hey, I need you to go.

272
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,478
[Craig] I'm going, I'm going.

273
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,581
[manager] I'm so sorry. We're going
to get this cleaned up for you.

274
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,084
[dramatic music]

275
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,155
[indistinct chattering]

276
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,424
[Max pants]

277
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,361
Uh...

278
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,698
do you, do you think
I could, I could...

279
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,967
I could take you on
a date some other time?

280
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,138
Uh...

281
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,642
I, I can't.

282
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,342
I, I'm sorry.

283
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,117
[dramatic music]

284
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,991
[vehicle whooshing]

285
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,274
[Max sobbing]

286
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,579
[girl] What are you doing?

287
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,148
[whimpering]

288
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,283
I'm Alex.

289
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:44,585
I remember, I'm just...

290
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,088
Just kind of
in the middle of something.

291
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,425
What, am I interrupting your
dramatic leap off the bridge?

292
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,528
[Max heavily breaths]

293
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,363
Bad things happen
because of me and...

294
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,735
And they'd stop once
I'm gone, okay?

295
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,104
That's pretty dark.

296
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,440
Yeah, well, my life
is pretty dark.

297
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:08,575
It could be the sunglasses.

298
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,518
Jelly bean?

299
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,355
But they only have
the gross flavors.

300
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,824
Well, because I ate
all the good ones,

301
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:24,726
and this is the shit
I was left with.

302
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,093
Thanks, I'm good.

303
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,330
- [sweets splashing]
- [Max gasps]

304
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,432
Fair enough, you jump, you jump

305
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,668
in the river
full of jelly beans.

306
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,137
I had, I had a dream
once that...

307
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,708
that I was swimming
in a pool full of jelly beans.

308
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,143
[mellow music]

309
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,513
Doesn't seem like
much of a drop.

310
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,452
You should probably find
a higher bridge.

311
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,087
What? [chuckles]

312
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,189
You want to die, right?

313
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:58,626
Yeah.

314
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,496
Well, then you should
find a higher bridge.

315
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:05,867
Wait, what? Wait, what?

316
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,602
Are you, are you serious?

317
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,737
Well, it's just physics.

318
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,172
What did you want me to say?

319
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,374
[scoffs] I don't, I don't know.

320
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,411
Look...

321
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,513
you're not going to jump.

322
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:23,250
You're going to die an old man
warm on your bed, not here.

323
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,686
- Not this night.
- [Max sobs]

324
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,287
"You jump, I jump," remember?

325
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:32,326
Did you just quote <i>Titanic?</i>

326
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,896
Well, my ride's here.

327
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,164
- [brakes squeaking]
- [Max] You're leaving?

328
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,532
If you're going to end
your life forever,

329
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,267
what's a couple
more hours with me?

330
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,170
[jolly music on radio]

331
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,745
Let me see if
she's taking visitors today.

332
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,882
Thank you, Myrtle,
nice to see you as always.

333
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,653
What's with all the caps
and exclamation marks?

334
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,454
Oh, it's just
a reminder of, like,

335
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,789
how I like to live my life.

336
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,324
Loud, vibrant, bold.

337
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,427
Oh, okay.

338
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:10,597
No, I'm, I'm here
more than the staff.

339
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:13,233
So, it's just annoying
that they keep making me

340
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,736
sign in so I'm annoying back.

341
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,573
- [Alex sighs]
- You know, when you

342
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:20,942
said you were going
to take me somewhere,

343
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:22,744
I, I didn't really think

344
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,846
you meant the retirement home.

345
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:27,447
[chuckles] Well, I thought

346
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,816
nothing would make you
appreciate life

347
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,350
more than being
around a bunch of

348
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,285
old people who are
about to croak.

349
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,725
Hey.

350
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,192
Hello.

351
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,831
Alex, you usually
visit on Fridays.

352
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:45,432
Oh, it is Friday, Esther.

353
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:49,671
Oh, one of the upsides
to Alzheimer's,

354
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:52,305
it's almost always the weekend.

355
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,875
Hey, one of the many upsides.

356
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:54,942
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- By the way, I brought you

357
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:56,576
a present, this is Max.

358
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,446
Oh, what happened to your face?

359
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,784
I should have some vitamin D
ointment in my purse.

360
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,687
- He doesn't need ointment.
- [Esther] Oh, take the ointment.

361
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,855
- Was it a burn?
- Max fell on a brick.

362
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,557
- [gasps] A brick?
- And today he almost fell off of a bridge.

363
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,226
[gasps] Christ, boy,
are you drunk?

364
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,630
No, he's depressed.

365
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:21,002
[Esther] Rosemary,
this boy thinks he's depressed.

366
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:22,937
- Depressed?
- [Esther] Yeah,

367
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,939
wait until your bladder stops.

368
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:27,407
And they put you on this pill
that they shove up your ass

369
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,611
and then it gives you rashes in
places you didn't even know you had.

370
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,213
Then we can talk
about being depressed.

371
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:35,983
Oh my, your face.

372
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:40,554
Oh, good,
you have ointment. Ha-ha!

373
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,290
I have written over 30 novels.

374
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,526
I think I have an understanding
of the process.

375
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:47,929
You wrote novels?

376
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,430
Write novels, I'm not dead yet.

377
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,766
Romance novels.

378
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,501
[with raspy voice] Dirty ones.

379
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,938
Oh, like Danielle Steel?
My mom loves her.

380
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,505
Yeah, well, I went to college

381
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,041
with that bitch,
and let me tell you,

382
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,776
that ginger whore doesn't have

383
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,811
one original thought
in her brain.

384
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,480
Her last name is Steel
for Christ's sake.

385
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,515
She stole my shit!

386
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,985
Tell them what
you're writing now.

387
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:12,954
I think it's fabulous.

388
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:15,422
[Esther] Well, it's my last
novel. Not so much a memoir,

389
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,525
a personal walk
with Alzheimer's,

390
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,062
my descent into the disease.

391
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:25,666
I feel at my age,
all I have left is my mind.

392
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,301
If I lose that,
what else is there?

393
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,772
Son of a bitch, here she goes.

394
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,975
Not everyone has the ability
to face the unknown

395
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,509
with such courage, Esther.

396
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:40,081
I told you before, I think your
book's going to change lives.

397
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:43,316
I suppose, I mean, there
really isn't anything like it.

398
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,452
Except for maybe that one movie.

399
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,754
What movie?

400
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,024
Uh, you know, the one where
the woman can't remember,

401
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,392
- and he comes every day.
- <i>The Notebook?</i>

402
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,930
Yes, it's maybe
a lot like that one.

403
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,632
[Alex chuckles]

404
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,668
[somber music]

405
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,843
You didn't, you didn't have
to walk me all the way home.

406
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:10,912
Oh, I just wanted to make sure

407
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:13,580
you're home wasn't the bridge.

408
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,552
You're home, cool.

409
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,754
- Yeah.
- Have a good night.

410
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,889
Do you...

411
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,592
[laughs] Um...

412
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,964
[groans] what are,
what are you doing tomorrow?

413
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,433
Tomorrow?

414
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:34,869
Yeah.

415
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:36,604
Oh.

416
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:41,709
I can't.

417
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:44,979
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

418
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:45,947
No, that's...

419
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,683
Uh...

420
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,854
I just... it's not you.

421
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,121
Today was really fun.

422
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,424
Um, I just... I wasn't really...

423
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,862
- planning this.
- Yeah, okay.

424
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:02,630
Okay.

425
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,099
Sorry.

426
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:08,803
Have a good night.

427
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,475
[announcer] <i>You lose.</i>

428
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,444
[music playing on video game]

429
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,680
Did you at least
get her last name?

430
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:21,849
[Max] Why would I ask her that?

431
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:23,416
Dude, you always ask
for the last name

432
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,819
so you can creep her
on social media.

433
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,486
- Ugh.
- Was she hot?

434
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,091
- Uh, I don't know.
- [controllers clicking]

435
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:31,959
I'm not buying it.

436
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:32,960
[scoffs]

437
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,931
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- [chuckles] Ha!

438
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,065
I'm over this.

439
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:43,771
You know, you could try
retracing your steps.

440
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:45,106
Try and bump into her again.

441
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:50,878
Oh, see, a little bit
of ass, I told you.

442
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,781
[gentle music]

443
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,803
[truck rumbling]

444
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,025
Uh, hey, you, you just,
you just missed your bus.

445
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,661
- Are you stalking me?
- [Max] What?

446
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:41,996
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm...

447
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,563
So what, what are
you doing here?

448
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,636
[Max] I was, I was...

449
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,570
Maybe I'm stalking you.

450
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,840
You didn't know I was
going to be here.

451
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,175
Really? Because I'm pretty sure

452
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,810
I'm here and so are you.

453
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,150
I think the fact that I can't
see your confused face

454
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:05,052
makes me want to screw
with you more.

455
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:13,060
Are you sure you don't
want to hang with me again?

456
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:14,594
Don't you have school?

457
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,164
I'm, I'm, I'm home-schooled.
[chuckles]

458
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:20,067
That's still school,
it's literally in the name.

459
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:24,271
It's, it's, it's called an
independent, independent study.

460
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,978
Hey, if you're
already skipping...

461
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:36,549
why not just spend
a couple more hours with me?

462
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,086
[gentle music]

463
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,665
- Yes. [sighs]
- Yes?

464
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,734
[Alex] Start walking
before I start saying no.

465
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,002
[Max chuckles] Okay.

466
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:05,046
Can I interest you two
in a free RPG starter pack?

467
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,816
How many goblins
are in this game?

468
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:12,620
Hundreds, and there's like
goblin hordes and clans and...

469
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,055
But there's only one wench?

470
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:17,291
Eleanor the Savage Queen of Man.

471
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:20,795
What are those goblins
doing to Eleanor the Savage?

472
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:24,665
Well, they are, um,
ravaging her dungeon.

473
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:34,608
This is not enough. Excuse me?

474
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,144
Hi, do you have
any more in the back?

475
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:45,686
[Alex shrieks]

476
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:47,788
[jelly beans clattering]

477
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,657
[Max chuckles]

478
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:55,029
Jelly beans are supposed
to feel like jelly

479
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:56,730
not like gravel.

480
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:57,865
[both chuckle]

481
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,367
My dream would have been
much more comfortable.

482
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,336
What was your dream?

483
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,638
Um, a river full of Jell-O.

484
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:07,808
- What flavor? [chuckles]
- Celery.

485
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,911
That's, that's not a real thing.

486
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,746
Um, it is 100% a real thing,

487
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,348
housewives in the 1960s used it

488
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,850
to rebel against their husbands.

489
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,655
Alex, I have
to tell you something.

490
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,795
I was born with a face and...

491
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,731
Ooh, you were born with a face.

492
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:31,866
[chuckles]

493
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,268
[gentle ambient music]

494
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,903
[exhales sharply] God.

495
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:40,040
My face is lethally attractive.

496
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:46,213
So, when people see it,
when they see my face, they...

497
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:47,314
Die?

498
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,958
[loudly sighs]

499
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,828
Okay.

500
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:04,965
- Okay?
- I mean, not okay, but...

501
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:07,334
it's old news.

502
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:09,069
You already knew?

503
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:13,140
Besides, you're kind of
a big hit at the hospital.

504
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:14,275
[Max chuckles]

505
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:16,744
Wait...

506
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:20,981
what are you doing
hanging around the hospital?

507
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,456
I have a rare
cardiovascular disease.

508
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:32,993
What's wrong with your heart?

509
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:36,997
[sighs] I'm allergic
to endorphins.

510
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,800
Excitement causes inflammation,

511
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:42,736
which causes my heart to grow.

512
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,310
This monitors heart
rate and heart size.

513
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:52,846
So any emotion,
good or bad, my body rejects.

514
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:56,984
It's okay though because they
put me on this trial medication,

515
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,186
and I got really lucky
because it works.

516
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,890
So, now my heart is basically
on <i>Weight Watchers</i>.

517
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:05,960
So, you're fine?

518
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,796
Well, if you consider
taking a pill every day

519
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:11,398
and wearing a robotic
bra fine, then, yes.

520
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,501
My heart is not currently
a ticking time bomb.

521
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:22,376
Have you ever thought about
if your life were a movie,

522
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:24,411
what song they would
use in the montage?

523
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,248
Mm... no.

524
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:30,818
Do, do most people
think about that kind of stuff?

525
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:34,154
Yes, everyone, except you.

526
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:35,356
[Max chuckles]

527
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:41,495
This is for one of those moments

528
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:45,165
where your life
derails you, and your head

529
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:47,167
and your heart can't keep up.

530
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:51,305
Everything plays out
like a blur.

531
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:55,342
And all you hear is this.

532
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,381
[gentle music playing on phone]

533
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:09,023
[gentle music]

534
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,861
This movie theater hasn't gotten
a new movie in five years,

535
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,396
but this will make it
feel like new.

536
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,302
[both exhale]

537
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:25,272
- Is this wine?
- Yes, the vodka kind.

538
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,475
- It tastes like nail polish.
- That's how you know it's effective.

539
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,811
How do you know what
nail polish tastes like?

540
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,181
Thanks. [sighs]

541
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,354
[jovial music playing]

542
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:45,225
[groans] I don't think I can
finish this whole bottle.

543
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:48,062
Don't you dare ruin this for me.
I've wanted to do this for so long.

544
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,364
- [whispers] Why?
- Because I could never do

545
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,266
anything fun,
because I was always sick.

546
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:55,502
[sighs] Besides, I didn't
really have any friends.

547
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,209
[dramatic music playing]

548
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:04,144
You're my first friend.

549
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:06,513
[creepy child's laughter]

550
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:09,249
Do you want
to play a drinking game?

551
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,552
- How, we've never seen this movie?
- Yes, it's like

552
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,420
the Any Movie Drinking Game.

553
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,956
- The Any Movie Drinking Game?
- [whispers] Yes, go!

554
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:18,525
Okay, okay, okay, uh,
if you see a title card, drink.

555
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,593
- Go.
- Okay.

556
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:21,462
[upbeat techno music]

557
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:23,130
[Alex chuckles] Next.

558
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,632
Oh, okay.
Oh, if there's a flashback.

559
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,266
Yes!

560
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,569
Any time an actor talks.

561
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,537
Any time it says,
"From the producers of,"

562
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:32,272
Any time someone wakes up, go!

563
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:36,043
- Eugh!
- [planet booming]

564
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,412
Planets! Excessive
armpit hair. Cheers!

565
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:39,947
[Max chuckles]

566
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,982
- [groans]
- Gosh, it's really hot.

567
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:43,450
- Are you hot?
- No.

568
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:45,386
I'm, like, boiling
in here. [chuckles]

569
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,955
- Why is it sticky here, too?
- [Alex giggles]

570
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:50,491
- Can you feel your teeth?
- Yes.

571
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:54,495
- Are they there?
- Is this your first time drinking?

572
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,169
[Max groans]

573
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:05,172
- Buddy, you need to drink this.
- [groans]

574
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:07,207
- What, all of it?
- Yeah, all of it.

575
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,575
[Max] Oh, I can't.

576
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,977
- [Alex] You can.
- I'm going to drown.

577
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,412
[Max gulps]

578
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:12,579
- [Max chuckles]
- Oh!

579
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,047
[phone buzzing]

580
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:15,949
Oops.

581
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:17,551
[groans]

582
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:20,254
Hey!

583
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,523
Dude, why aren't we hanging out?

584
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:24,391
- <i>This is stupid, come over.</i>
- Hi.

585
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:29,129
Oh, shit, um, you two just
get back to whatever it is

586
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:31,532
that you were doing, and Max?

587
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,133
Yeah.

588
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,636
- <i>You're my boy.</i>
- Oh. [groans]

589
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:36,704
Who was that?

590
00:30:36,738 --> 00:30:38,071
Dan.

591
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:39,006
Dan.

592
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,475
What was that?

593
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,477
Oh, this is the tiny
light of death,

594
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:45,245
pray it never blinks.

595
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,219
- Max?
- Hmm.

596
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,323
I want you to stitch me
like one of your French girls.

597
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,459
[gentle ambient music]

598
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:01,395
Okay, Rose.

599
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,568
[with puppet voice]
I can feel you staring at me.

600
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:11,371
[chuckles] You can't see
if I'm staring at you.

601
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:19,046
I can't see what you're
doing. [chuckles]

602
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:29,056
[gentle music]

603
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:48,776
Hi.

604
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,213
[door clicking]

605
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,448
[Jan] Max!

606
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:55,449
[Max] Uh.

607
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,321
Max, I...

608
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:04,626
Oh, wow.

609
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,629
[softly mumbles]

610
00:32:07,662 --> 00:32:09,697
- A girl.
- Oh, God. Please kill me.

611
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:11,598
Hi, I'm Alex.

612
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,173
- Whoa, whoa.
- [Alex] Oh.

613
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,543
- Sorry, I'm a hugger.
- What, since when?

614
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,044
- No, you're not!
- [mumbles]

615
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:27,180
I'm, uh... I, uh... I'm a shaker.

616
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:28,282
- [Alex] Hi.
- Hi.

617
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:30,450
Dad.

618
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:32,386
[Alex chuckles]

619
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:33,821
[Jan] Oh, come on in.

620
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,257
This is Yu Shen.

621
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,761
She's from the exchange program.

622
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:42,630
Yu Shen,
welcome to your new home.

623
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,458
I'm in hell.

624
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,634
[chuckles]

625
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,703
You're so cute, isn't she cute?

626
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:51,806
- Yes.
- [cat meows]

627
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,711
- Oh!
- [cat hisses]

628
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:57,745
[door slamming]

629
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,482
She's a little jet-lagged.

630
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:04,151
[upbeat music playing]

631
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,321
[groans] Damn it.

632
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,791
You take two steps forward
and the next thing you know,

633
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:11,592
you're face down
in the shitter wondering

634
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:12,860
how the hell you got there.

635
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:18,332
Hey, why is Rosemary
sitting all by herself?

636
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:21,501
She's waiting for her son to take
her to get pie for her birthday.

637
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:23,871
She says he comes every year,
but I've never seen it.

638
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:25,339
It's her birthday?

639
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,274
82, but I didn't tell you.

640
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,877
She wants everybody
to think she's 88.

641
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:33,246
- Why?
- Well, when you're young, you lie about your age

642
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,783
because you can't accept the
fact that you're getting old.

643
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:38,418
But when you crack 70,
all you want is for people

644
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,855
to tell you,
"You don't look your age."

645
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:42,456
[Max chuckles]

646
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,491
The pie is not
going anywhere, Ro.

647
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:46,426
Get your sweet ass in here!

648
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,528
Could you stop screaming at me?

649
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,799
She's always on me about my ass.

650
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:55,202
Oh, I love this game.

651
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:57,437
Happy Birthday, Rose.

652
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,907
88 years, can you believe it?

653
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:02,844
88, you barely
look a day over 82.

654
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:05,412
You told him.

655
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,180
Let the boy give you
a compliment.

656
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:10,685
Thank you, I have
a lot to be thankful for.

657
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:13,587
My health, my friends.

658
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:15,823
I honestly don't know
what I'd do without you.

659
00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:18,458
Well, you would carry on
like the rest of us.

660
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:21,461
I told you,
I'm not strong like you, Esther.

661
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:23,363
If I knew what was coming,

662
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,499
I don't know if could put
myself through it.

663
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:27,234
[Esther] It's not strength, Ro.

664
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,569
We didn't sign up just
for the good parts.

665
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:32,807
The good comes
with the bad, that's living.

666
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,281
Oh, shit,
I hate this goddamn game!

667
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:42,382
[Rosemary] My turn!

668
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:45,552
[Jan] And that is the secret

669
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,888
to American cuisine.

670
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:50,524
- [phone clicking]
- Craft.

671
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:53,527
Max, did your goblin
starter kit come

672
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,395
with an oraculum gem?

673
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,866
I have no idea what that means.

674
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,770
Yu Shen, what does
your mom make for dinner?

675
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:05,673
Maybe I could try
to something ethnic.

676
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:06,641
[doorbell ringing]

677
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,777
[steps loudly]

678
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:15,382
[door thudding]

679
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:16,884
- Uh, you got to pay for these.
- [Jan] Sorry about that.

680
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:19,654
Sorry, here you go.
This is for you.

681
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:20,955
Thank you so much, sorry again.

682
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:21,956
Have a good night.

683
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:24,759
- Tomorrow, you're taking her.
- What?

684
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,427
No, she, she, she doesn't
want to be here.

685
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,864
Max, Yu Shen's family
is very well off, okay?

686
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:31,465
- This is an adjustment for her.
- So what?

687
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:33,000
Can you please
show a little sympathy?

688
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,434
I'm... so, I...
you want me to feel

689
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,937
bad for her because she's rich?

690
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,939
[Jan] No, would it
hurt you at all to try

691
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:39,539
and help her get acclimated?

692
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:40,742
I have plans tomorrow!

693
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:44,244
Max, I'm asking you
to be a friend.

694
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:49,617
Mom, I'm supposed to go
camping with Alex and Dan.

695
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:53,788
Then you, Alex, Dan and Yu Shen

696
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,422
will have a great day tomorrow.

697
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:56,791
This is a dictatorship.

698
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,525
Well, no one said it
was a democracy.

699
00:35:58,558 --> 00:36:00,962
Oh, real American, Jan.

700
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,764
- Oh, you're calling me Jan now?
- [Max] Yeah, you look

701
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,031
like a Jan to me.

702
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay.

703
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:06,934
[door slamming]

704
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:10,504
Thanks, thanks, Paul.
Thanks for your help!

705
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:12,774
- How am I missing Grishnakh.
- And for listening!

706
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:15,575
- Honey, could you move my character kit?
- What?

707
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,879
- Grishnakh. He's a level three key master.
- What?

708
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:19,814
He, he's, he's,
he's the only goblin

709
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,581
who can penetrate
Eleanor's secret vault.

710
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:22,482
I'm lost without him.

711
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,452
It was right here
in this front drawer.

712
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:27,989
What is this game?

713
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:30,490
[bright music]

714
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:33,527
[thudding]

715
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:38,065
[Max] Yu Shen!

716
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,745
I hate to burst your bubble,
but it's way too flimsy.

717
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:53,648
Uh, don't act like
you know what I'm doing.

718
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,784
Well, it looks like
you're making a walking stick.

719
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:58,853
That's funny because
I'm making a...

720
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,755
[twig snapping]

721
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:03,958
...wand to close the portal.

722
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:04,892
What portal? [chuckles]

723
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,594
One to the alternate
dimension Dan's dates

724
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,596
- keep crawling out of.
- [camera clicking]

725
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,800
I don't know, maybe Tiffany's
exceptionally warm-blooded.

726
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:16,604
- Like a human polar bear.
- Please, have more respect

727
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,438
for the polar bears.

728
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:21,341
[chuckles] Can you get a picture
of us against this wall?

729
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,678
That's a tree.

730
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:25,947
Aren't you freezing?

731
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,682
No, it's fur.

732
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:29,083
- Oh.
- [Dan] It's nice.

733
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,084
[Alex] Christ.

734
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,418
[camera clicking]

735
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,956
[gasps] Oh, shit, girl,
you're bleeding.

736
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:36,858
I just... oh.

737
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,458
[Max] Oh, here, uh,

738
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,161
I've got, uh...
here, give me your hand.

739
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:42,964
No, that stings, I don't
really want you to do that.

740
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:44,866
- Muffin tits.
- What, muffin ti...

741
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:49,637
- [Alex sighs]
- [Max] Give me one second.

742
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:54,407
Oh, it looks like we have
a Boy Scout on our hands.

743
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,543
[mellow music]

744
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:05,720
How's that feel?

745
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:10,992
Fine, thank you.

746
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:19,133
[heart pounding]

747
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,908
[Tiffany giggles]

748
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:29,777
[Yu Shen snores]

749
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:33,848
I know he's your friend,
but that's got to get old.

750
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,618
I don't know, I...

751
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,520
I accepted a long time ago

752
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:41,889
that Dan has...

753
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:44,591
what I don't.

754
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,193
Oh, come on.

755
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:48,696
You're not exactly wearing
that 'cause you're ugly.

756
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:49,864
[Max snickers]

757
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:56,604
It would be nice to know what
you looked like under there.

758
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:00,908
It's just a face.

759
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:21,228
What are you doing?

760
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:24,632
Close your eyes
and don't open them

761
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,067
until I tell you to, okay?

762
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,670
Okay, Mr. Serious.

763
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:30,972
[Max] I am being serious.

764
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:33,473
[gentle ambient music]

765
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:55,863
I wish you could see my face.

766
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:00,901
You really know how to make
a girl feel like Helen Keller.

767
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:03,536
[Max laughing]

768
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,007
[Alex laughing]

769
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:09,010
- [Alex] Max?
- Yeah.

770
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,511
Have you ever been kissed?

771
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:13,781
Almost...

772
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:17,718
once.

773
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:23,090
I was in the first grade
and I met this girl,

774
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:29,529
and we decided that we would
be each other's first kiss.

775
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:33,267
So, I told her
to close her eyes.

776
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:40,207
But first graders, they just
don't listen very well.

777
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,047
I'm not going to make
the same mistake as that girl.

778
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:49,016
Technically, it'd be hard
because you're blind.

779
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,328
[Alex sighs]

780
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:06,133
[heart pounding]

781
00:41:11,372 --> 00:41:13,707
- No, no! [chuckles]
- [chuckles] Nice.

782
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:18,379
Every time. [groans]
Here. Have fun losing.

783
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:20,147
Wait, does she even
know how to play it?

784
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:23,350
- [character grunting]
- Oh, damn, she's good.

785
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:24,718
How are you so good at this?

786
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,833
Be my American boyfriend?

787
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,957
- What?
- [phone buzzing]

788
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,728
Hey, are you on your way?

789
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:38,099
Oh, um, my mom just declared
a mandatory spring cleaning,

790
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:40,367
so I'm kind of
a prisoner at the moment.

791
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:43,137
Spring? It's freezing outside.

792
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,640
I know, she doesn't understand the
seasons, so we must all suffer.

793
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,709
Oh, God, I didn't even know
you could do that!

794
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:49,710
[controller thudding]

795
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:52,012
Hold on one second.

796
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,417
Let's get nasty tonight.

797
00:41:54,748 --> 00:41:56,817
What, what, what did she say?

798
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,020
- [Alex chuckles]
- [Max] I'm sorry, there's weirdness happening.

799
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:02,356
Just text if you want
to hang out later, okay?

800
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,658
Yeah, I'll talk
to you later, bye.

801
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:10,231

- [announcer] <i>Paging Dr. Ross,</i>

[muffled talking]

00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:22,243

that would cause her heart to grow?

[announcer] <i>Dr. Kravitz,
you are needed here in...</i>

806
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:26,714
Max, can you pause the game?
I need help real quick

807
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:28,082
- with something small.
- Sure, Mrs. Richardson.

808
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:30,151
Ah-ah. This request isn't

809
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:31,785
either going to be
small nor quick.

810
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,288
I need you to take out
the Christmas tree.

811
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:35,956
- Told you.
- [festive music]

812
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,291
[groans] This tree is a bitch!

813
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:38,392
You know what? Shut up.

814
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:39,793
You did this.

815
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:42,997
- [Dan groans] Shit, hold on, hold on.
- [Max] Okay.

816
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,233
[Dan] I think I got
a splinter. [groans]

817
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,002
[Max] Okay, well, come on,
let's go upstairs.

818
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:49,703
I think my mom's
got some tweezers.

819
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:52,706
- [Dan] It hurts.
- [Max] Just stop crying.

to burn the house down!

All right, all set.
So, you're going to change out

831
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:27,508
the dressing in two
to three days.

832
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:28,876
I'm prescribing you
an antibiotic ointment,

833
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,110
so you can put it on every day.

834
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:32,713
Do you have any questions?

835
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,015
- What are you doing later?
- You can take any

836
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:36,984
over-the-counter pain
medication. Just make sure

837
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:38,886
you're taking the proper dosage.
And if the pain or swelling

838
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,321
increases,
you come in immediately.

839
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:42,523
Otherwise,
I'll see you in seven days.

840
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:44,225
Wait, I get to see you again?

841
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,793
For your follow-up, yes.

You know, she really
doesn't seem like your type.

Yeah, what do you know
about my type.

00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:57,238
Hmm, brainless.

- Dude.

00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:13,821
[Alex's mom] I don't understand,
why didn't you tell me?

852
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,389
Mom, because I knew
you'd freak out.

00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:18,926
Hey.

different shifts. Don't worry.

00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:15,949
10,000 units of Gremlin.

870
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:17,619
[mellow music playing
in the background]

871
00:45:17,652 --> 00:45:21,388
And he supposedly comes
with detachable goblin armor.

872
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,991
Which you should be
able to hear.

873
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:26,327
[box clattering]

874
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:37,004
Hey, Dad, when you and Mom met,

875
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:39,573
how did you guys know
that you liked each other?

876
00:45:48,616 --> 00:45:50,384
[box clattering]

877
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:54,021
I took your mother to dinner.

878
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:58,092
I think it was...
our second date.

879
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:00,561
We were walking
to the car and she said,

880
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,329
"Paul, you love me, okay?"

881
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:05,299
And, and that's how I knew.

882
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:09,269
You might think it's blatantly
obvious that you like Alex,

883
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:11,105
but there's a good chance
she has no idea.

884
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:13,608
Uh, I never said I liked Alex.

885
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:19,880
Well, hypothetically,
if you did.

886
00:46:24,686 --> 00:46:27,521
Communication goes
a long way with women, Max,

887
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:30,391
especially since they think
men are incapable of doing it.

888
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,259
And I'm going to go out
on a limb and say

889
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,629
that if you did decide
to tell Alex how you feel...

890
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:39,333
you might like
what she has to say back.

891
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:43,638
[gentle music]

892
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:46,173
[Alex] Like, what is
in the Blegh Sex Shop?

893
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:51,278
[Max] I don't know. Uh, probably
something really gross or really lame.

894
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:53,914
[Alex] Dildos for dogs.

895
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:57,251
[Max] Kale-flavored condoms.

896
00:46:57,284 --> 00:46:58,686
[Alex] Oh, my God,
your dad's nudes.

897
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,920
[Max] Ugh!

898
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:09,496
Alex, are we going
to talk about yesterday?

899
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:14,101
Oh, um, I just said
you volunteered at the home

900
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,469
because it's easier for my mom.

901
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:17,672
- Easier?
- Yeah.

902
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:19,239
Check-ups are really
triggering for her

903
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:20,742
and the idea of me
having friends

904
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:22,576
still feels like
a death sentence.

905
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,278
But she likes when
I volunteer at the home

906
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:25,546
because she thinks it's nice

907
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,683
and safe and boring.

908
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:32,986
You're on meds though
so why is she so worried?

909
00:47:33,788 --> 00:47:35,422
Because that's
how anxiety works.

910
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:42,296
Okay, I'm sorry.

911
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,964
It's fine.

912
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:52,039
Don't tell me it's Friday.

913
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:53,540
I know it's Wednesday.

914
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:55,242
- It's Wednesday.
- Yeah.

915
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,177
[jovial music playing]

916
00:47:58,145 --> 00:47:59,346
What's all this?

917
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:02,049
Oh, uh, we got Rosemary pies.

918
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:04,284
Uh, but we weren't sure
what flavor she liked best,

919
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:06,553
so we just got her
a slice of each one.

920
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:07,789
What's wrong?

921
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:09,122
[sighs]

922
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,294
[machine beeping]

923
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:23,370
[Esther] Look who came
to see you.

924
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:25,072
Rose?

925
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,242
Rose?

926
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,449
I, I can't let her
see me like this.

927
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:51,766
[Max] Hey, Rosemary,

928
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:54,501
[heart pounding]

929
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,204
Rosemary, it's me and Alex.

930
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:03,076
[Alex sniffles]

931
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:04,679
[Alex sighs]

932
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,324
You okay?

933
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,496
It's not right.

934
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:27,200
The way they have her
hooked up to those machines.

935
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:31,204
I know, it sucks.

936
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:35,409
But they are
what's keeping her alive.

937
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:36,343
No.

938
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:39,179
They're barely
holding onto her...

939
00:49:40,447 --> 00:49:41,515
for what?

940
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:44,384
Some stupid moral compass

941
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:46,486
that says
that's the way it has to be?

942
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:52,192
That's the way it is.

943
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,163
Well, what we can do about it?

944
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:00,802
You can help her.

945
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:11,411
Alex, you can't ask me that.

946
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:13,815
- You said it doesn't hurt.
- I don't think it hurts.

947
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:15,750
It doesn't look like
it does, but I, I...

948
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,885
it's not like I can ask them
after it happens.

949
00:50:17,919 --> 00:50:20,287
[somber music]

950
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:22,122
Alex.

951
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:27,194
I know you think what happens
with you is a curse.

952
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,398
But those people who have seen
your face will never have

953
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:34,201
to know what it feels like
to lose yourself slowly.

954
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:40,608
To have your last memory
be withering away

955
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:42,209
in a hospital bed.

956
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,488
She shouldn't have to bargain
away her dignity to die.

Hey, Rosemary.

960
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:01,789
Do you want to go to sleep?

How, how was school?

[bag thudding]

968
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:27,507
She's miserable, and your father
is taking over the house.

969
00:53:27,842 --> 00:53:29,944
Max, will you please
explain to your mother

970
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,613
that some of us have a stressful
job to go to all week

971
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:34,414
and shouldn't be villainized

972
00:53:34,447 --> 00:53:36,449
for treasuring a minuscule
amount of free time.

973
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:38,753
What does it look like
I'm doing right now, Paul?

974
00:53:38,786 --> 00:53:39,787
This is a job.

[Jan loudly sighs]

976
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,697
So, how are things with Alex?

977
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,834
I don't know.
She's not texting me back.

978
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:57,104
Well, how you perceive things

979
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,107
may not be how Alex sees them.

980
00:54:01,474 --> 00:54:03,577
Okay, well, how are guys

981
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:06,479
supposed to just psychically
know what girls are thinking?

982
00:54:06,513 --> 00:54:08,515
It just, it makes,
it makes no sense.

983
00:54:08,548 --> 00:54:10,383
If I knew the answer
to that my house

984
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,019
wouldn't be overrun by goblins.

985
00:54:12,854 --> 00:54:15,790
I'm sorry I enjoy the few
things that make me happy.

986
00:54:16,157 --> 00:54:17,792
So, now I'm the villain.
Max, will you please

987
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:18,926
explain to your father
the definition

988
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,127
of a double standard?

989
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:21,829
Oh, my God, this is so stupid.

990
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:23,664
You just need to stop
nagging him, and,

991
00:54:23,698 --> 00:54:25,498
Dad, you need to stop
playing that game so much.

992
00:54:25,532 --> 00:54:29,036

complicated, holy shit!

Ah-ha! See? I knew
she had a shift today.

Just got to make sure
she's no longer with Craig.

Have you heard
our specials today?

1002
00:55:08,009 --> 00:55:09,476
No, but you seem pretty special.

[chuckles] Wait,
don't we go to the same school?

1004

What? We should go
to the Spring Fling together.

1005
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,052
- [waitress] Yeah?
- Yeah.

- [chuckles] Pick me up at eight.
- Okay.

- No, that's dumb. You're coming to the dance.

00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,232
No, I, I don't even go
to your school, man.

Look, it doesn't matter, dude.
You're my wingman, bring Alex.

really talking to me, so.

- Hey, Dan, give that back.

Come here. You can't just
take my phone and then...

- Just drop it.

They just need to up my dosage.

But your heart, your...

1026
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:50,611
your heart's gotten bigger.

1027
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:04,658
I just don't understand why
you didn't say anything to me.

1028
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,895
Why, so you could freak out,
stop talking to me

1029
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:09,864
and I go back to living
in a padded cell?

1030
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:12,599
You didn't even give me
a chance and now,

1031
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:15,169
now I feel like I'm the reason

1032
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:17,338
this whole thing
has gotten so bad.

1033
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:19,572
I'm sorry I've made it
so bad for you.

1034

That's not what
I'm saying, Alex.

You just have to wrap
your face every day, Max.

I don't get a quick fix.

1037

It's really not fair.

I'm sorry.

01:07:49,436 --> 01:07:51,673
I guess I just wanted
to know what it would feel like

1213
01:07:51,706 --> 01:07:53,808
to be something
more than a burden.

1214
01:08:03,316 --> 01:08:04,686
You're not a burden, Alex.

1215
01:08:15,595 --> 01:08:16,731
I've...

1216
01:08:17,765 --> 01:08:19,734
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

1217
01:08:20,802 --> 01:08:22,737
And I've thought
of different scenarios.

1218
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:26,306
How long I was going to wait.

1219
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:30,510
How I should ask you.

1220
01:08:37,952 --> 01:08:39,486
Max, I'm not
getting any better...

1221
01:08:39,519 --> 01:08:41,254
I won't do that.
I couldn't do that.

1222
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:42,589
...and I can't put
my mom through it anymore.

1223
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,725
Do you know what
you're asking me?

1224
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,592
I mean, do you?

1225
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:49,630
Do you know what it's like
to, to watch someone die?

1226
01:08:51,364 --> 01:08:52,934
To have that imagine
burned in your head,

1227
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:54,836
over and over and over and...

1228
01:08:57,004 --> 01:08:58,405
Do you know what that's like?

[light dramatic music]

1230
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:04,946

[Jan] How can you not give us
any more information?

1232
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:23,064
Was he allowed to just
leave on his own?

1233
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:24,364
He's a minor!

1234
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:27,869
I mean... [scoffs] isn't it
required to call his parents

1235
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:29,269
before you release him?

1236
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:32,707
Yes, yes, of course
I called him.

1237
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,441
He's not answering his phone.

1238
01:09:35,408 --> 01:09:37,945
[sighs] Please don't
tell me to calm down.

1239
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,546
My son is missing.

1240
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:42,549
Okay, is there a supervisor
I can talk to?

1241
01:09:42,582 --> 01:09:45,052
I need to talk to someone
who can actually help me.

Hey.

1271

Still here?

1272
01:11:48,575 --> 01:11:50,811
Yeah, didn't feel right,

1273
01:11:51,212 --> 01:11:53,014
saying goodbye
with all those people.

You talk to Alex yet?

1280

She's been trying
to get a hold of you.

1281
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:16,203
What, are you,
like, avoiding her?

1282
01:12:19,674 --> 01:12:20,841
Does it matter?

1283
01:12:22,977 --> 01:12:25,947
- Dude, don't be a dick.
- "A dick." [scoffs]

You don't even know
what you're talking about.

1285

Alex is sick, man,
and you're avoiding her?

1286
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:33,020
I don't know what's going on with
you, but that's super shitty.

1294
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,843

I just figured, decorate the walls,

1300
01:13:34,181 --> 01:13:35,649
it felt so empty.

1301
01:13:47,795 --> 01:13:50,631
I finally stitched you
like one of my French girls.

Hey.

Don't be jealous that
I'm better at dying than you.

Uh, you, you mean, since Alex?

1386
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:21,896
Well, yes, but more so with you.

1387
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:24,832
[upbeat music]

1388
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:27,501
[Max] <i>Valencia's case
finally settled.</i>

1389
01:24:27,534 --> 01:24:31,304
<i>The coroner said she died
of a serotonin overdose,</i>

1390
01:24:31,338 --> 01:24:34,709
<i>or as the jury saw it,
natural causes.</i>

1391
01:24:36,678 --> 01:24:39,847
<i>So, the judge dropped
all of the charges,</i>

1392
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:41,949
<i>even for Craig.</i>

1393
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:45,585
<i>After the trial, the publicity</i>

1394
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,690
<i>from the case made
national headlines.</i>

1395
01:24:48,723 --> 01:24:50,992
<i>Most people didn't believe
there could be a kid</i>

1396
01:24:51,025 --> 01:24:55,562
<i>with a lethally attractive face.</i>

1397
01:24:55,595 --> 01:24:59,232
<i>But there are others
who somehow knew,</i>

1398
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:02,302
<i>or hoped that I could help them,</i>

1399
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:04,872
<i>the same way Alex hoped</i>

1400
01:25:04,906 --> 01:25:05,973
<i>that I could help her.</i>

1401
01:25:08,475 --> 01:25:12,412
<i>I always thought that
my face only caused pain,</i>

1402
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:15,817
<i>what I learned was, I could
use it to take pain away.</i>

1403
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:19,386
<i>I still visit Esther.</i>

1404
01:25:19,419 --> 01:25:21,521
<i>She sometimes
asks where Alex is.</i>

1405
01:25:21,555 --> 01:25:24,726
<i>It's harder for her
to remember the big things.</i>

1406
01:25:24,759 --> 01:25:27,628
<i>I tell her that Alex
is busy suing Danielle Steel</i>

1407
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:33,668
<i>for plagiarism,
that always makes her happy.</i>

1408
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:39,774
<i>The last thing Alex taught me
was that those that see me for me</i>

1409
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:43,611
<i>don't find my face
to be the most attractive part.</i>

1410
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:45,545
<i>Unconditional love
is the immunity.</i>

1411
01:25:47,447 --> 01:25:49,617
<i>And while I'll never
live a life completely</i>

1412
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:52,486
<i>without wrappings,
I can find moments</i>

1413
01:25:52,519 --> 01:25:55,823
<i>with the ones that matter.</i>

1414
01:25:55,857 --> 01:26:00,327
<i>Even my parents
have gotten... closer.</i>

1415
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:04,331
<i>They found a way to meet
each other in the middle.</i>

1416
01:26:13,808 --> 01:26:16,677
So, what's next?

1417
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:18,746
I'm not sure.

1418
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:24,451
Maybe trying
to live without these.

1419
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:26,586
[therapist] It's a big step.

1420
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:29,857
Do you think that's
something you can do?

1421
01:26:33,761 --> 01:26:34,729
Yeah, I can try.

1422
01:26:36,063 --> 01:26:38,699
[upbeat music]

1423
01:27:45,032 --> 01:27:46,701

- [Dan] <i>I'm trying, I'm trying.</i>

1424
01:27:46,734 --> 01:27:48,169
[Max] Oh, God.

1425
01:27:48,202 --> 01:27:49,502
- [Dan] Oh, don't.
- [doorbell ringing]

1426
01:27:49,536 --> 01:27:51,471
[Max groans] I'll get it.

1427
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,374
- [Dan] Oh.
- [Max] Pause it.

1428
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:04,584
Hey, so, my parents
thought it'd be a good idea

1429
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:06,654
if I apologize
or whatever it is, so...

1430
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,156
- Oh, shit.
- [Max] Oh.

1431
01:28:09,891 --> 01:28:12,760
Shit, shit!

1432
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:16,764
- Oh, my God.
- [Max] I'm, I'm sorry.

1433
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:19,133
Damn it, Max.

1434
01:28:19,166 --> 01:28:20,567
[Max sighs]

1435
