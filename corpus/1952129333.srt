1 
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:04,220 
Welcome to Las Vegas. 
And yes, this is my type of town. 

2 
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:08,020 
Everyone comes and thinks: 
Will win, win, win! 

3 
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:13,323 
Do you think you can 
to lose? NO! 
"READY OR NOT" 

4 
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:18,631 
I'm Mark. I came to 
Las Vegas, knowing that they will lose.                     

5 
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:21,607 
How will lose. 
I am a winner. 

6 
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:23,866 
Get this over with.                
I feel nauseous. 

7 
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:27,673 
Winners and losers. 
             
8 
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:30,811 
Loose, Chris 
my best friend. 

9 
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:34,885 
Everything you say is               
one word: YES! 

10 
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:38,323 
and his life, my life              
changed forever. 

11 
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,659 
Who will help me to thrust these two? 
                  
12 
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,389 
It was working before Chris 
choose another and leave it to me. 

13 
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:48,825 
Does he think about the consequences? 

14 
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,968 
These are teachers, 
sexy teachers! 

15 
00:00:51,037 --> 00:00:53,101 
I want to follow a teacher.                                              

16 
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:57,476 
How much longer will pretends, 
because we know how easy teachers have? 

17 
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:04,008 
Maybe my friend is 
needs professional help? 

18 
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:09,315                                                                                       
Such that comes with crack, fireworks 
dolarcheta and brilliant. 

19 
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:12,920 
Oh, it is hidden, 
little brother.                                         

20 
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:19,556 
Should be fun. And you know 
who loves the most fun - married. 

21 
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:21,860 
Like Lawrence, who lost 
prior three years. 

22 
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:24,634 
And now, Chris. 
Can be seen.                                           

23 
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:35,469 
I am kumat. And if my boy 
killed, it happens in the sky. 

24 
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,311 
- Come on, you promised! 
- Last time you brought me here alone. 

25 
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:46,351 
- Traitor! 
- Please! 

26 
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:48,385 
- Shackle me! I am serious. 
- Yes! 

27 
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,227 
It is very tight. Do not feel 
his left hand. 
                                       
28 
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,823 
Relax! Is a stripper! Everything 
have to do is to lie. 

29 
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,063 
Well remember the last time 
Having sex with me. 

30 
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:02,370 
-I will see you later, dude. 
- Please. 

31 
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:08,106 
- Do it! NOW! 
- Hey, Tina! 

32 
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:12,049 
You know what's wrong?                                        
Should not touch it! 

33 
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:14,218 
How could you? 

34 
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:18,655 
I'm next. 

35 
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:22,289 
- No, no, no! 
- Come on, baby! 

36 
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,958 
Come on, I felt 
they do not like me. 

37 
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:28,964 
No way. I ... will marry. 

38 
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:32,765 
Congratulations!                                      

39 
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:36,166 
- Thank you! 
- Now you naked! - Oh, no, no! 

40 
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:42,267 
- Do you cry?

41 
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:46,468 
- I do not want to hurt you! 
- I think there pliers. 

42 
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,969 
Hey, no lash of hair. 
Without whipping strut. 

43 
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,570 
Without kisses without spirit, 
no ears, no. no, no! 
                                      
44 
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:59,971 
Oh, hello! 

45 
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,072 
No where to run! 
No where to hide! 

46 
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:05,473 
Mark! 

47 
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:13,074 
Dino, Dino! I thank the morning!

Did you know? 
Take double for gas! 

49 
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,184 
Sounds fair! 

50 
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,650 
- Obuy you some pants.

51 
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,201

52 
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:47,771 
- Bubu, hello!

53 
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:51,637 
But sutienat his mind. 

54 
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:55,347 
Ladies, please, shake 
chichko coin. 

55 
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,017 
Oh, this is great, Mark! 

56 
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:04,118 
Just to think that you are not the greatest 
badass land you back to me. 

57                                          
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,159 
Is Dean wants to keep it? 

58 
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,513

59 
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,182 
- I can not breathe! 
- I hear you. 

60 
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,919 
No joke! Seriously! 

61 
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,462 
Are you crazy, huh? 

62 
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:50,598 
Where are we ... 
Can we go back to the hotel, please? 

63 
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,799 
- No, no, no turning back!                                       
- Lawrence! 

64 
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800 
- Stop what you do!

65 
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,501

66 
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:02,002 
- I have fun! - I. 
- No fun! 

67 
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,503 
Look! I was back at the hotel! 

68 
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,804 
- This is the best 
you able to? 

69 
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:11,505 
- Yes! 
- I know a better way to spend your money? 

70 
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,323                                       
Probably. 

71 
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:16,229 
- Morris, this is crazy. 
- Yes, it is 

72 
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,798 
- Someone I remove my handcuffs? 

73 
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:25,437 
- Come, stay? Come, stay? 
- Coming! 

74 
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,156 
Hang on back there. 

75 
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,427 
Excuse me, king of heaven! 

76 
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:53,229 
- See this small section of the map? 
- Yes! 

77                                     
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,399 
I see little point. 

78 
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,867 
This was my first rodeo. 

79 
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:03,178 
Tsepi my head. 

80 
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:05,411 
I see everything twice! 

81 
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:09,845 
- Two cloud! - Sure, 
you want to ride this bull, cowboy? 

82 
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,349 
- You fly there? 

83 
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,449                                                               
Good job, Skipar. 

84 
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,871 
Do not be mad, right? ... 

85 
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,733 
- Fall! 
- What? Please? 

86 
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,903 
- I told you it was a bad idea! 

87 
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,536 
- Will become a jelly! 
- Oh, my God! 

88 
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:37,647 
- There is no airport there? 

89 
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:38,877 
No joke! 

90 
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,578 
You have permission to search. 

91 
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,083 
Hey, you okay? 

92 
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:44,084 
- Hey what are you? 
- How was your flight? That yours? 

93 
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:51,385 
- Yes, thank you. 
- Listen, we do not have time. 

94 
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,060 
- Wait! Brand! Wait! 
What the hell is going on? 

95 
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:56,364 
- I do not know, but it is very exciting! 

96 
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,134 
What are you drinking?                                                                                                      

97 
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,694 
Count to ten and pull the rope! 

98 
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:06,704 
You can do it! 

99 
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,943 
- Oooo! 
- You crazy son of a bitch! 

100 
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,483 
Jump to the bottom! 

101 
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:22,582 
Abnormal Sons of bitches! 

102 
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,783 
Be careful not to 
land across the border! 

103 
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,590 
Better not abroad! 

104 
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,950 
However, if it was not cool. 

105 
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,251 
Where he goes? 
Where he goes? 

106 
00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:01,855 
G-yeah, just jumped ... 
by fucking plane. 

107 
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,131 
- And our Push, Push us! 
- What the hell? 

108 
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:07,832 
Mark decided that we need 
of adventure. 

109 
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,333 
Not marry 
even one weeks! 

110 
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,875 
I tried to wake up. 

111 
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,576 
Jumped on the fucking plane. 

112 
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:17,444 
- And our Push, Push us! 
- I know! 

113 
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,438 
Why? 

114 
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:25,753 
Where the hell are we? 

115 
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:29,588 
- Cape! 
- Cape? 

116 
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:34,393 
I hate your way of showing off, 

117 
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,294 
but you will 
any lake in the Cape. 

118 
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:44,636 
- This is the lake? 
- Yes! 

119 
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,609 
Yes, this is the lake! 

120 
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:50,504 
Jerk! 

121 
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,139 
- Shit! 
- That was not part of your plan? 

122 
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,779 
- No! 
Hey, what plan? 

123 
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:01,289 
Cape for the night. Login. 
Get out! Damn! 

124 
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:03,226 
Are you crazy? 

125 
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:06,527 
- I had to take relatives tomorrow! 
- I can not believe Mark! 

126 
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,428 
He had to take relatives 
its tomorrow! 

127 
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:09,729 
No more talk, it was squirt, 

128 
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,130 
I gave you an assignment and you 
failed to preebesh! 

129 
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:15,700 
I can not compare it with that! 

130 
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:18,473 
Sorry! 
"Golden Girls" is not porn! 

131 
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,405 
Just is not f. 

132 
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,411 
Funny, huh? 

133 
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,283 
You, my friend, 
under its steam! 

134 
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,051 
What happened? 

135 
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,052 
You missed a great show! 

136 
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,553 
I do not fuck her? 

137 
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,095 
Mark, tell me that 
I did not fuck her! 

138 
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:47,707 
If you will help you to sleep! 

139 
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,608 
Damn! 

140 
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:51,909 
No, you did not! 

141 
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,910 
Not. 

142 
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:06,019 
I am not! 

143 
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:10,827 
If you say so! 

144 
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:16,525 
What is wrong with you? 
Are you a freak? 

145 
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:19,035 
What was that? 

146 
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,163 
Guns! 

147 
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:42,452 
I see that you want 
you alone, right?

00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:49,556 
Remove your hands!

No, no no! 
Hands off! 

151 
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:09,245 
No, no ... wait!

00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,801 
Thanks!

157 
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,050

Smile! 
Everybody is laughing! 

175 
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:24,315

Let us celebrate the new

178 
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,292 
-What 's friend? Have fun! 
- I can! 

179 
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,536 
It's easy, you know! 

180 
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:15,737 
- Do not fall in their dance. 
- Okay. 

181 
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:19,208 
- You like girls? 
- Oh, yeah, yeah! 

182 
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,609 
Well, Mark, oh yeah! 

183 
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,880 
Such ready units 
You do not even try! 

184 
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:40,481 
See Lawrence, 
He even included. 

185 
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,648 
What is wrong with you? 
Lost its sense? 

186 
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,513 
Very bad thing last night. 

187 
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:04,516 
- Easy slip. 
- Protective mechanism. 

188 
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:05,486 
I heard about it. 

189 
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,787 
First, Lawrence, and now you! 

190 
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,588 
You already old. 

191 
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,560 
What? You think so? 

192 
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:13,561 
This is a trap! 

193 
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:17,362 
Women grow 
only one objective: 

194 
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:20,963 
To provide life 
from father to cocksucker! 

195 
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:23,637 
And the blower is. It? 
- I am. 

196 
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,975 
Suck and fuck for beauty. 

197 
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,776 
To marry 
bogatashka is skill! 

198 
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,777 
I got skills! 

199 
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,484 
Why should you care? 

200 
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,885 
For young 
lord Dean 

201 
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:40,154 
they are soft ... dangerous 
... and predictable. 

202 
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:44,894 
And we could not do 
do so it ... 

203 
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:47,663 
Watch and learn! 

204 
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,264 
Good day senyorita. 

205 
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,438 
If you plot will 
sorry the rest of your life. 

206 
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,532 
That was a hindrance. 

207 
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:10,586 
You are here 
for their gift. 

208 
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:13,622 
A little early yet, right? 

209 
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,425 
Lunch is now. 

210 
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:20,224 
Enjoy yourself? 
- Oh yeah! 

211 
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,190 
This ... should not attach. 

212 
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,497 
- Do you understand? 
- Pedro. 

213 
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,498 
Understand. 

214 
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:32,899 
Yes, liege. 

215 
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,500 
Me again no lighter. 

216 
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:39,301 
Relax! 
All are red. 

217 
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,502 
Right back. 

218 
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:48,203 
- Pryateli, go here. 
- What? 

219 
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:50,504 
No, no, no! 
We at least a week. 

220 
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,305 
- I call it. 
- Chris? 

221 
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:54,623 
- What? 
- Do not go easy! 

222 
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,496 
To get 
other glasses. 

223 
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:04,202 
Hello! 

224 
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:08,804 
Hello! 

225 
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,953 
Still worry 
for Vegas? 

226 
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:22,587 
Your friend is back. 

227 
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:27,423 
Sorry, ladies, as if 
this was said. 

228 
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,930 
Someone found a friend. 

229 
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,340 
Hey, what about 
that there? 

230 
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:49,941 
- Do I look? 
- Definitely. 

231 
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:53,387 
Mark, I want to 
concentrate here, buddy. 

232 
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,188 
Here you have two. 

233 
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,690 
When you give what 
need, you will leave me! 

234 
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,463 
Friends. Go you! 
Now! 

235 
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,164 
- What? 
- Move it! 

236 
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:09,265 
- I do not vote for it, and you? 
- I! 

237 
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:10,266 
We have not voted! 

238 
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,367 
Christie kill joy. 

239 
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:14,007 
- Let go. 
- I got to have fun! 

240 
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:15,305 
Out! Now! 

241 
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:17,809 
A serious re? God! 

242 
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,444 
Good play, while 
Christian is not called. 

243 
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:24,587 
My people will take! 

244 
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:25,788 
Super We don ... 

245 
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,058 
Don Julio de Monterees. 

246 
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:33,386 
In fact, we are fine! 
Enough attention you created. 

247 
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:35,287 
- No, it did not care. 
- Nothing. 

248 
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,088 
I think you will get 
wheels. Thanks. 

249 
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:41,838 
No. We can go! 

250 
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:47,173 
Yes, but the next village is 
about 25 kilometers north. 

251 
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:50,302 
East, northeast. 

252 
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,380 
Thank you! 

253 
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,350 
Bye. 

254 
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:08,054 
I know what I saw! 

255 
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:11,427 
- Burning his face. 
- Overreacting! 

256 
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:14,567 
I am serious! 

257 
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,897 
- Heh, heh! 
- Not funny! 

258 
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,698 
- This man is crazy! 
- May want to get away? 

259 
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:22,999 
I saved your life! 

260 
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,900 
And where was, where women? 

261 
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,101 
- Very suspicious! 
- Whatever! 

262 
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,608 
There should be 
a prenuptial agreement! 

263 
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:34,787 
As a baseball! Conclude 
3-year contract by mutual consent 

264 
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,592 
and sign a clause 
for performance. 

265 
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,093 
if both sides are 
satisfied - awarded contract. 

266 
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:45,122 
- And if they are not. - Become free 
agents! Signed another check! 

267 
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:47,423 
- I made it! 
- Why not shut up! 

268 
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,739 
You had your idea 
to go! 

269 
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:56,744 
Do not know where we go, right? 

270 
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:00,145 
Right? Mark, where 
the hell are we? 

271 
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:04,446 
Tell him not to move! 

272 
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,147 
Freeze! 

273 
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,125 
So we use three. 

274 
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,126 
Lawrence? 

275 
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,464 
You can 
to run into my eye! 

276 
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,865 
Stand as responsible for 
social work 

277 
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,110 
I gotta tell you - take it! 

278 
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,440 
Last hole! 

279 
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,541 
He called me an asshole? 

280 
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:36,180 
I guess. 

281 
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,254 
We want to rest. 

282 
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,095 
Not matter that 
want to play! 

283 
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,098 
Were you I would 
to think it! 

284 
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,899 
No way. 

285 
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,400 
This is the justification 
to pull the woman every weekend! 

286 
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:56,331 
What? I still can? 

287 
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:59,032 
Yes. Transmitted from father to son. 

288 
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:01,604 
Bad marriage is 
that zadobryavash with chekiite. 

289 
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,375 
- No problem, right? 
- Fuck you! 

290 
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:10,013 
- What I did not understand? 
- Your mom has other plans for you! 

291 
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:13,853 
Your father does not trust your secrets. 

292 
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:37,909 
Something is way. 

293 
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,953 
Money, give me money to give them 
people to lead us to the city. 

294 
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:56,298 
- No me wallet! 
- Shit! 

295 
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:58,098 
Cool. 

296 
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,037 
Hey, stop! 

297 
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,402 
What do we do now? 

298 
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:10,571 
So Mark was only nine 

299 
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,906 
when he spoke Spanish. 
Does he have money? 

300 
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,807 
- At least Schilling? 
- None! 

301 
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,547 
Behold! It is! 

302 
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:24,048 
Hey, slow down. 
Hey, Chris, stop it! 

303 
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:27,922 
Will stop I will stop! 
Will stop I will stop! 

304 
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:36,605 
Stop! 

305 
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,506 
Hey, what is your problem? 
To kill you want? 

306 
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:42,707 
Will take you to town? 

307 
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:45,908 
That zavoalirash words 
not make them Spanish. 

308 
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,245 
So help me! 

309 
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:48,546 
I'm Mark. 

310 
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:51,948 
My friend Mark, 
I speak English. 

311 
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:54,915 
Will you ride? 

312 
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,922 
- Nacho is macho. Repeat! 
- Nacho is macho! 

313 
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:05,164 
This will put you 
in the car, so ... 

314 
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:07,865 
No, wait! 
Nacho is macho! 

315 
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:14,935 
Ok! Get in! 

316 
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:38,756 
The man brought us down to the city. 

317 
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,491 
Will take you tomorrow at seven. 

318 
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:45,935 
Thank you very much. 

319 
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:51,094 
I need to call. 

320 
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:11,395 
Senor, can I call? 

321 
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:14,196 
But ... no money. 

322 
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:15,597 
Please! 

323 
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,498 
- Can I? 
- Yes. 

324 
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,399 
Thank you very much. 

325 
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,700 
Hi, honey! 

326 
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:29,135 
Hello, sunshine! 

327 
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,636 
I was a good boy? 

328 
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:33,713 
Very good boy! 

329 
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:41,356 
Hey, Lawrence, a woman 
You will want to see you? 

330 
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:44,360 
Not even understand that I will not. 

331 
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,555 
But thanks for the concern. 

332 
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,364 
How were the strippers? 

333 
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:51,398 
Starichki. 

334 
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:52,999 
Mark? 

335 
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400 
You 're kidding, there was no money. 

336 
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:59,265 
You got into the shoes 
or somewhere else? 

337 
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:03,241 
Damn! 
I need a drink! 

338 
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:10,319 
We can still stay 
one night. 

339 
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:14,414 
But will return in time 
to take my parents, right? 

340 
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,951 
Father! Father! 
Father! 

341 
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,033 
Do not worry about me! 
Get the next plane! 

342 
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:27,334 
Cool. 

343 
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,535 
Thank you, darling! 

344 
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:32,736 
Do you guys really 
want to stay another night. 
Or two? 

345 
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,374 
- Did you call? 
- I will be okay somehow. 

346 
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:39,276 
- I love you! 
- I. 

347 
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:45,086 
I am not in Mexico! I am not! 

348 
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:47,413 
Mexico? We are not in Mexico? 

349 
00:26:50,895 --> 00:26:52,956 
Mark? 

350 
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,554 
You idiot! 
Watch it come! 

351 
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:57,126 
The deal is a deal! 

352 
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:58,927 
You know him? 

353 
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:02,493 
Quit! You have not already 
His best friend! 

354 
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:03,594 
I am! 

355 
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,434 
Do not worry! 

356 
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:08,375 
Even my five days! 
Will you give it on Sunday! 

357 
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:10,672 
Night, which says YES! 

358 
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,843 
That depends on it! 

359 
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,344 
And when it did ... 

360 
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:20,220 
goodbye ... Must not 
I see more! 

361 
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,987 
- Bye! 
- Mark? 

362 
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,152 
Thank you! 

363 
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:32,793 
He unhooked! 

364 
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,235 
She was mad, man! 

365 
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:41,307 
I gotta tell you ... 
I can not believe you lied! 

366 
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:43,202 
What do you think?

	367 
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,016 
What you need to 
I think, is this picture! 

368 
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:48,717 
Calm down, buddy! 
Relax! 

369 
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:53,756 
- I mean more! 
- Very! 

370 
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:56,156 
Do it for me! 

371 
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,866 
Fuck you! 

372 
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,678 
How are you? 

373 
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,050 
Well. 

374 
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:23,051 
Without ... and ... doubts. 

375 
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,252 
Of course! Who's not 

376 
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:28,817 
Should not. 
For me this is a game. 

377 
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:32,525 
Fuck you! 
I know what you try! 

378 
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,932 
No. Not trying 
to do nothing. 

379 
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,494 
You have 5 days. What - will 
you do your manicure? 

380 
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,567 
Huh? Hey, Chris? 

381 
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:44,898 
Relax! 

382 
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:51,111 
Well, take a deep breath. 

383 
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:52,778 
Friends? 

384 
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:54,944 
She said what? 

385 
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:56,921 
- Take care. 
- Do not fuck with me! 

386 
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:58,517 
You have 5 days to myself. 

387 
00:28:58,518 --> 00:29:02,018 
- What did she say? 
- She said: Have fun! 

388 
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:05,853 
See you on Sunday. 

389 
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:08,424 
Really? 

390 
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,528 
- It is your half? 
- You bet! 

391 
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:18,035 
So are we friends? 
- Yes. 

392 
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:23,036 
We are friends! 

393 
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:40,509 
Wonderful. 

394 
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:59,239 
We have to become witnesses 
a miracle you do with your eyes. 

395 
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:15,518 
Thank you. 

396 
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:21,094 
Thank you. 

397 
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,255 
Who is your favorite Mexican food? 

398 
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,725 
I like rice with beans that? 

399 
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:28,726 
Exactly. 

400 
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:31,327 
Get beans with rice hereafter. 

401 
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,328 
For the rest of my life. 

402 
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:37,329 
For breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

403 
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,530 
Bob Rice? 

404 
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,431 
Even if you do not want beans with rice 

405 
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:46,885 
must eat! Even if you 
sick and you feel! 

406 
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:51,490 
given his word. Bob Rice 

407 
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:54,624 
till death do you part. 

408 
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:05,068 
I have a question? Have you seen 
three? Three 

409 
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,601 
gringos? That way you? 

410 
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:12,440 
For you and for you. Good night! 

411 
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:13,610 
Good night. 

412 
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,051 
Bob Rice, please! 

413 
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:28,630 
Where the hell was that? 
What do you care master "hollow head. 

414 
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:31,257 
This is the third bar, 
you go! 

415 
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:35,027 
- Who is this? 
- Meet with Antonio! 

416 
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:39,928 
Antonio, hello! 
What is it, you do not have money? 

417 
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,838 
Charat is an international currency. 

418 
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:44,846 
For the good old days! 

419 
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:47,747 
- Cheers. 
- Cheers. 

420 
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,499 
Be tender with me baby! 

421 
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,725 
What does she here? 

422 
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,902 
- Do not hang, you remember? 
- Yes. 

423 
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:22,043 
However, if you do not start the fire 
I slightly wet. 

424 
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:24,144 
- Really? God. 

425 
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:46,245 
- Outstanding! 
- Thank you! 

426 
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:50,146 
- My name is cigars. 
- Hi, Pyuri, I'm Mark. 

427 
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:54,347 
Took my ... akala 
That Lawrence was married before ... 

428 
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:57,548 
A elegant son of a bitch here ... 
Christie is. 

429 
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:58,949 
I am Diiyn. 

430 
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,050 
So, what brings you here? 

431 
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:07,551 
We have to understand that 
Our friend was really in love. 

432 
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:10,752 
I love you? 

433 
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:13,653 
No ... it is 
my little brother. 

434 
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:17,254 
Here is a 
Jury still gone. 

435 
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:21,555 
Well, I love you? 

436 
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:24,256 
Absolutely ... no! 

437 
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:29,057 
- Ah, there you are! 
- Evidence not presented in court. 

438 
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:31,358 
That you luck out, 
does not mean that you are happy. 

439 
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,659 
Just ... ignore them. 

440 
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,860 
Mind them so much. 

441 
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:38,961 
Remember me? 
Push me to the floor. 

442 
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:41,662 
Do not regret it? 

443 
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:42,663 
No. 

444 
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:54,930 
For the unity of souls! 

445 
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:59,471 
Thousand times beautiful 
from this place. 

446 
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,512 
This depends on the body. 

447 
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:09,549 
So you are sensitive, huh? 

448 
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,550 
I love games. 

449 
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:13,512 
Small or large. 

450 
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:16,251 
Will not pretend. 
Hope! 

451 
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:20,052 
Your girlfriend loves you 
dog? 

452 
00:36:22,165 --> 00:36:23,934 
Bye, girls! 

453 
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:30,535 
Your girlfriend loves you 
dog? 

454 
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:32,904 
Do not iztarvem train. 

455 
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,874 
Will catch the train. 

456 
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:36,775 
Catch you later. 

457 
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,914 
Deceived us! 

458 
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:57,225 
Sorry. There are my friends. 

459 
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,277 
Relax! We run this morning! 

460 
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,579 
- To relax? 
- Excuse me ... 

461 
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:24,284 
With them I am. 

462 
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:29,992 
Lawrence can get us out. 
What do you think? What do you think, Lawrence? 

463 
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,833 
Or is his wife, 
Grab your toe or legs! 

464 
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:39,567 
And it is .. Fascinating! 
So you pay the bills? 

465 
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:42,742 
No ... I gave them my watch. 

466 
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,874 
Nonsense! 

467 
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:50,212 
Damn! 
Why are Americans so nervous? 

468 
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:53,578 
Prison may cause you. 

469 
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,094 
Sorry. Right? 

470 
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:09,295 
Sorry, what? 
You have nothing to regret. 

471 
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,737 
It was a joke, you know. 

472 
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:14,703 
Behold! 

473 
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:23,704 
Hey, buddy! 

474 
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,805 
Me and my friends like 
conditions here! 

475 
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:32,506 
And f. .. 
I think it's time to go. 

476 
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:35,607 
And can you 
leave a gift. 

477 
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:38,808 
Nice, huh? 

478 
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:45,364 
Son of a bitch. 

479 
00:38:46,944 --> 00:38:49,841 
Just kidding! Please him! 

480 
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:54,047 
There stopwatch. With eight features! 

481 
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:00,010 
I will not sleep on the street! 

482 
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,011 
I do not blame me, man. 

483 
00:39:23,212 --> 00:39:25,112 
Whose fault is, Mark, huh? 

484 
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:26,513 
Yours. 

485 
00:39:28,414 --> 00:39:30,614 
Violated its own rule! 
You have to be there! 

486 
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,215 
What rule? 

487 
00:39:32,816 --> 00:39:34,416 
All 
which behave. 

488 
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,617 
If one years does not mean 
someone you love 

489 
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:39,218 
never do it! 

490 
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:42,019 
And never say you love her? 
- Yes. 

491 
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:43,793 
- About one years? 
- Yes! 

492 
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:47,001 
I told her that would say, 
when does something about it! 

493 
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:48,335 
Well, I mean? 

494 
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:49,336 
Of course! 

495 
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:51,301 
Then what is the problem? 

496 
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:52,302 
Violates his rule. 

497 
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:56,774 
And you lied. 

498 
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:16,688 
Damn! 

499 
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,864 
Don Julio. Glad to see you. 

500 
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:24,335 
I am not here to 
talk to you. 

501 
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:25,436 
Dad. 

502 
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:28,241 
Dad ... 

503 
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:33,302 
Which part of "not 
hanging "do not understand? 

504 
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:35,603 
Dad, do not be such a kiddo! 

505 
00:40:36,485 --> 00:40:38,183 
I know this is not 
looks good, but ... 

506 
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:41,884 
leave your name, my name 

507 
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:43,885 
in this cell. Open! 

508 
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,426 
Dad! 

509 
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:01,776 
Will ask you to dig 
their own graves 

510 
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:05,004 
will now leave the city and will 
to return 

511 
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,479 
or you will face changes. 
- Yes, sir! 

512 
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:09,774 
No! You can not chase 
everyone who met! 

513 
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:11,919 
Yes, you! 

514 
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:14,879 
I'm not a kid anymore. Can 
meet with whomever I want! 

515 
00:41:14,957 --> 00:41:17,992 
You love me, baby. 
You know what: Get in the car! 

516 
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:08,935 
Look! 

517 
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:10,536 
Drop on his horse! 

518 
00:42:16,852 --> 00:42:18,252 
What are you doing? 

519 
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:32,659 
What? 

520 
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:34,928 
We must go! 

521 
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,746 
Come on, do not have time. 

522 
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:26,646 
Curtain! 

523 
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,521 
Long time no see, cousin! 

524 
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:33,022 
I still owe 200 Peso. 

525 
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:36,797 
Oh, that was fun! 

526 
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:38,361 
Pyuri must say! 

527 
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:40,164 
You can ride stuff! 

528 
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,868 
I can not believe you kiss! 

529 
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:43,869 
I am not! 

530 
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,937 
She kissed me! 

531 
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:47,208 
No food expectations! 

532 
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:49,345 
I just was 
right place. 

533 
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:53,376 
Why do women fall in love 
in the ass? 

534 
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:56,847 
I do not know. May 
as a mirror of Macy. 

535 
00:43:56,918 --> 00:44:00,007 
Women pass. 
You just have to do. 

536 
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:03,008 
While you take home. 
Then discarded. 

537 
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:06,609 
Come on. Go! 
Go. 

538 
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,410 
- Oh, no! 
- Two more for me! 

539 
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:12,227 
Damn. 

540 
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:21,628 
Presruvame may be that we 
Freddy Merkyuri found in levels 

541 
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:23,029 
You also do not understand! 

542 
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,230 
What's his name? 

543 
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,331 
We do not know. 

544 
00:44:35,832 --> 00:44:36,732 
Mark. 

545 
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,699 
I am a coward. 

546 
00:44:50,138 --> 00:44:52,332 
I will consider it! 

547 
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,933 
Come here. 

548 
00:44:57,434 --> 00:44:59,334 
What is he doing? 

549 
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:02,235 
Afraid 

550 
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:07,837 
as is a long chain 
of our family tree 

551 
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,825 
I will kill your family 
and will send in their ancestors. 

552 
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:16,832 
And? 

553 
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:20,533 
So what? 

554 
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,134 
This is a death wish! 

555 
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:28,767 
Is for you! 

556 
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:30,068 
Stand up against bika! 

557 
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:33,569 
Show style. 

558 
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:36,111 
Or ... 

559 
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:38,412 
Take one cow down 

560 
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:40,713 
Revive the name of your family! 

561 
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:47,424 
Got courage? 

562 
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,757 
Are you a man? 

563 
00:45:52,135 --> 00:45:53,534 
Huh? 

564 
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,740 
I do not think it is happy with that. 
- Shut up! 

565 
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:25,566 
Get the cloak and restore 
honor of his family, matador! 

566 
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:27,426 
Take this mantle. 

567 
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:30,299 
Do it, matador! 

568 
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:34,678 
Exactly. 

569 
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:47,845 
Sineokiya like, right? 

570 
00:46:48,646 --> 00:46:51,446 
Crap! This vbesyava me! 

571 
00:46:51,964 --> 00:46:53,964 
What? 
- Nothing! 

572 
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:55,860 
Thinks like Mad friend. 

573 
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:57,761 
Of course. 

574 
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:00,769 
Glad you came! 

575 
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,764 
Me too. 

576 
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,436 
Try "Margarita." 

577 
00:47:04,437 --> 00:47:05,937 
Will help you to relax. 

578 
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:09,978 
I like such as 
speak Spanish. 

579 
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:11,869 
And you know? 

580 
00:47:11,882 --> 00:47:13,006 
Neither word. 

581 
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,407 
But I love you 
I hear you talk. 

582 
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,308 
And certainly not a word! 

583 
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:18,309 
What a sap! 

584 
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:23,510 
Inside there is sufficient alcohol 
to kill a horse. 

585 
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:25,451 
Cheers! 

586 
00:47:27,664 --> 00:47:29,193 
What deceives boy. 

587 
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:33,062 
I still think that you 
cast an eye on sineokiya. 

588 
00:48:28,092 --> 00:48:30,017 
Mark? 

589 
00:48:30,018 --> 00:48:31,618 
My bike! 

590 
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:45,631 
Friend, you gave me courage 
and self-esteem! 

591 
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:50,508 
My name is Pablo. 

592 
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:56,717 
You fight bulls! 

593 
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:58,779 
Alone in the circle of life. 

594 
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,080 
And your name is .. 

595 
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:10,481 
e .. e .. 

596 
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:13,682 
El Solo! 

597 
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,467 
El Solo! 

598 
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,508 
If any. 

599 
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:20,836 
El Solo! 
- El Solo! 

600 
00:49:36,192 --> 00:49:37,659 
I did it! 

601 
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:40,753 
Can be sweet 
if you want. 

602 
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,190 
Want to walk? 

603 
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:51,164 
Enjoy! 

604 
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,810 
F. .. passed three years. 

605 
00:50:06,946 --> 00:50:08,446 
Six were yesterday 

606 
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:10,847 
What are you lucky! 

607 
00:50:13,748 --> 00:50:15,748 
What changed? 

608 
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:17,349 
I do not know! 

609 
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,350 
Come on, tell me! 

610 
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,351 
It is not about what I have ... 

611 
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:25,452 
what have you! 

612 
00:50:25,453 --> 00:50:28,053 
I have grave. 

613 
00:50:28,879 --> 00:50:31,146 
I want change. 

614 
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:33,941 
Just change? 

615 
00:50:35,018 --> 00:50:36,585 
Nothing else, asshole! 

616 
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:42,222 
She quit! 

617 
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,727 
I know! 

618 
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:51,621 
Sorry. 

619 
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:56,222 
I did not know! 
- Nobody knew. 

620 
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:04,305 
Lived with this ... 
87 days. 

621 
00:51:05,014 --> 00:51:06,075 
Damn! 

622 
00:51:06,076 --> 00:51:07,476 
Fault is mine. 

623 
00:51:07,777 --> 00:51:10,077 
No, man, sorry! 
You lived alone ... 

624 
00:51:10,051 --> 00:51:12,182 
I do not know whether I 

625 
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:13,283 
Nothing! 

626 
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:17,190 
To be here ... 

627 
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:19,353 
you guys ... 

628 
00:51:21,363 --> 00:51:22,753 
was great for me. 

629 
00:51:28,036 --> 00:51:29,864 
Hey, champ! 

630 
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:31,433 
It was so long! 

631 
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:32,934 
Liked everything. 

632 
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:52,183 
Seriously! You can find it again. 

633 
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:53,455 
David went where? 

634 
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,758 
Becomes very irritating. 

635 
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:01,597 
You know what me tease me? 

636 
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:03,398 
What? 

637 
00:52:07,845 --> 00:52:10,503 
When a woman thought, 
it can use to brush my teeth! 

638 
00:52:13,481 --> 00:52:15,540 
Over the line! 

639 
00:52:16,018 --> 00:52:17,449 
Wait to become clear! 

640 
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:22,850 
You can schedule your language galoto her 
but it can not use your toothbrush? 

641 
00:52:23,551 --> 00:52:25,451 
May not for another reason. 

642 
00:52:25,962 --> 00:52:27,886 
You should have a 
toothbrushes? 

643 
00:52:34,172 --> 00:52:36,401 
Try it, man. 

644 
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,014 
What is wrong? 

645 
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:49,618 
What did he do? 

646 
00:52:49,786 --> 00:52:50,749 
Nothing! 

647 
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:54,614 
What do you think I am? 

648 
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,925 
No guilt. 

649 
00:52:57,995 --> 00:53:01,586 
We drink and 
fun. 

650 
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:03,261 
You heard wrong. 

651 
00:53:05,836 --> 00:53:06,836 
Tell me then. 

652 
00:53:08,404 --> 00:53:10,670 
You keep thinking to myself 

653 
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:12,171 
in a relationship. 

654 
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:16,072 
You have no connection. 

655 
00:53:19,473 --> 00:53:22,973 
All links ... 
family, friends ... 

656 
00:53:22,974 --> 00:53:26,174 
lovers ... honestly ... 

657 
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:30,175 
much you want? 

658 
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:33,353 
No. 

659 
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:42,321 
Why ... is so difficult ... 
men ... to talk about their feelings? 

660 
00:53:43,022 --> 00:53:45,022 
Why not even try? 

661 
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:48,023 
Because men are idiots. 

662 
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,507 
I love to talk about them. 

663 
00:53:53,352 --> 00:53:57,876 
To explore ... 
and make them feel. 

664 
00:53:58,477 --> 00:54:05,677 
Can not always be described in words ... 
just ... I feel inside. 

665 
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:09,019 
I do not understand. 

666 
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:13,158 
So I was so 
hard to believe. 

667 
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,404 
If someone is there for you 

668 
00:54:18,441 --> 00:54:24,011 
and you find ... 
then you will understand! 

669 
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,375 
You are a good friend. 

670 
00:54:30,453 --> 00:54:32,181 
Now I feel 
better! 

671 
00:54:32,422 --> 00:54:33,693 
Thank you! 

672 
00:54:55,611 --> 00:54:57,042 
A El Solo! 

673 
00:54:57,913 --> 00:55:00,476 
Tonight ... 
will meet their fate! 

674 
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:04,286 
Will be a celebration 
all Mexican kittens. 

675 
00:55:06,256 --> 00:55:08,249 
Invite all your guests! 

676 
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:14,058 
El solo ... It would be an honor 
to see how you naritat ass tonight! 

677 
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:16,659 
But ... I have already won! 

678 
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,401 
Understand me, my friend! 

679 
00:55:20,302 --> 00:55:23,468 
But you will be there in spirit 
and see the girls! 

680 
00:55:25,341 --> 00:55:26,666 
Thanks, buddy! 

681 
00:55:28,044 --> 00:55:30,644 
Bratovchet I'll take. 

682 
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:36,516 
For the miracle to be European ... 

683 
00:55:37,085 --> 00:55:39,615 
to being touched. today 

684 
00:55:40,355 --> 00:55:41,756 
Cool! 

685 
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:43,954 
El Solo! 
- El Solo! 

686 
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:56,236 
Should go. 

687 
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:02,536 
Do not insult? 

688 
00:56:02,645 --> 00:56:04,269 
No, take what you want. 
You go. 

689 
00:56:04,846 --> 00:56:05,437 
Ok! 

690 
00:56:05,438 --> 00:56:06,838 
Hey, Pyuri! 

691 
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:10,348 
I know the world awaits you, but I do not think 
that he will do it! 

692 
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:11,649 
You see, dear? 

693 
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:22,019 
Do not worry, man. 
We will be there in 2 hours! 

694 
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:24,393 
Want to talk to Kelly? 

695 
00:56:25,067 --> 00:56:26,597 
Forget it! 

696 
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:29,468 
No, no, no! 

697 
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:52,059 
Do it for you, buddy! 

698 
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:28,249 
Hi! 

699 
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,550 
Hi! 

700 
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:32,051 
My name is Mark. And you? 

701 
00:57:34,052 --> 00:57:35,452 
Last night was Pyuri! 

702 
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:39,031 
Now you Laffite some 
girl from the bus? 

703 
00:57:41,877 --> 00:57:43,976 
What should I do? Ring you buy it? 

704 
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:45,310 
You lucky ... 

705 
00:57:46,984 --> 00:57:49,384 
Connections for one night last two-three weeks! 
After that, work! 

706 
00:57:49,385 --> 00:57:51,385 
When you knock? 

707 
00:57:53,455 --> 00:57:55,418 
I do not believe in love? 

708 
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:59,287 
I would say that is just vapor. 

709 
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:02,527 
You must be blind? 

710 
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,762 
For Pyuri is everything 
you might want a man! 

711 
00:58:07,002 --> 00:58:08,365 
Not so much sexy! 

712 
00:58:09,939 --> 00:58:11,570 
Son of a bitch! 

713 
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,111 
By erbap so as not to download it? 

714 
00:58:29,758 --> 00:58:32,256 
I just had to 
sleep with her, right? 

715 
00:58:33,027 --> 00:58:34,825 
I do not spend it! 

716 
00:58:35,497 --> 00:58:36,827 
Really? 

717 
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:39,725 
Fuck it! I never slept! 

718 
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:46,941 
Come on, Dean! You 
to fall in love in every city in the world! 

719 
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:49,870 
But we are here 
I already vlyubih! 

720 
00:58:51,148 --> 00:58:55,312 
- Really? - Yes, but 
idiot like you would not understand! 

721 
00:58:56,785 --> 00:58:59,319 
Does she know? 

722 
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:01,585 
No! 

723 
00:59:01,786 --> 00:59:02,986 
Of course not! 

724 
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:04,587 
Fuck you, Mark! 

725 
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:07,888 
Sufficiently lived in your shadow. 

726 
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:11,389 
And I know that is not always 
you are like me, but ... 

727 
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,790 
This is not true, okay? 

728 
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:15,591 
This makes big brother, Dean. 

729 
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:22,392 
Throughout my life I was 
afraid to talk to girls. 

730 
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,293 
Afraid to 
not reject me. 

731 
00:59:26,816 --> 00:59:29,075 
Because I believed that I can 
to compete with you guys. 

732 
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:33,215 
You know, she 
worth the risk. 

733 
00:59:34,022 --> 00:59:36,159 
I'm back! 

734 
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:37,960 
Where? 

735 
00:59:39,263 --> 00:59:41,427 
Back in the ring. 

736 
00:59:43,266 --> 00:59:45,026 
Back at the Don Julio. 

737 
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,568 
- Dean? 
- Wait, he will kill us all. 

738 
00:59:47,836 --> 00:59:49,763 
With you or without you ebachi! 

739 
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:52,406 
Dean is my wedding there! 

740 
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:57,807 
Sorry! 

741 
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:08,518 
Siege. Fucking siege! 

742 
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:10,519 
To Don Julio! 

743 
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:16,889 
I can not go back there! 

744 
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,190 
Yes, your wedding 

745 
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:19,632 
there is 

746 
01:00:20,703 --> 01:00:21,870 
I know! 

747 
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:24,130 
Come you guys? 

748 
01:00:30,012 --> 01:00:33,080 
The first case of disobedience 
throughout the journey. 

749 
01:00:33,147 --> 01:00:34,445 
And Dean? 

750 
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:44,952 
Will miss the entertainment! 

751 
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:46,621 
Fucking traitors. 

752 
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,312 
Come on Live! 

753 
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:11,677 
Wait a minute, 
and then can go. 

754 
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:14,681 
And Dean, he 
continue for at least 90 seconds. 

755 
01:01:31,174 --> 01:01:33,574 
Where are you going? There is a door here! 

756 
01:01:34,075 --> 01:01:35,967 
Asshole. 

757 
01:01:41,852 --> 01:01:43,349 
Who's there? 

758 
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:59,834 
Terrassa wrong. 

759 
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,732 
Who? 
- Don Julio! 

760 
01:02:07,576 --> 01:02:09,934 
Look what you give! 

761 
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,442 
Pyuri! 

762 
01:02:16,518 --> 01:02:19,114 
I am! 
Dean! 

763 
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:20,115 
El Solo! 

764 
01:02:21,089 --> 01:02:23,615 
Look who is there? 
- Yes! 

765 
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:25,326 
El Solo! 

766 
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:34,600 
El Solo! El Solo! 
El Solo! 

767 
01:02:36,037 --> 01:02:37,733 
What are you doing back here? 

768 
01:02:40,009 --> 01:02:41,301 
You want to tell me 
phone number? 

769 
01:02:57,895 --> 01:03:00,922 
Son of a bitch, what 
doing here? 

770 
01:03:00,923 --> 01:03:02,723 
Where is my daughter? Huh?

771 
01:03:15,576 --> 01:03:18,579 
Open the door! 
- Calm down! 

772 
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,149 
I can not believe 
I got her number! 

773 
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,197 
I am a man in my nature! 

774 
01:03:48,177 --> 01:03:50,574 
Hunter! 
- Hunting season is over 

775 
01:03:50,575 --> 01:03:51,575 
for me, Mark! 

776 
01:03:51,576 --> 01:03:53,176 
No, it will understand it! 

777 
01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:57,418 
Watch your dog! 

778 
01:03:59,155 --> 01:04:01,055 
What the hell? 

779 
01:04:01,757 --> 01:04:03,522 
Stuck! 
Damn! 

780 
01:04:06,696 --> 01:04:08,429 
Stupid dog! 

781 
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,530 
What the hell? 

782 
01:04:16,205 --> 01:04:17,665 
Where are you going? 

783 
01:04:18,676 --> 01:04:20,976 
Come on! Someone lives here! 

784 
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:30,078 
You will need to 
follow to the end! 

785 
01:04:31,887 --> 01:04:33,445 
Bad idea. 

786 
01:04:44,074 --> 01:04:46,474 
Want to know who you looking for? 

787 
01:04:47,475 --> 01:04:49,475 
No? I tell you! 

788 
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:55,273 
Confusion, chaos, vertigo! 

789 
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:58,709 
Followed by Disorientation and illusions. 

790 
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:02,410 
And must know rules 
for good? 

791 
01:05:03,011 --> 01:05:05,211 
Wear very fluid 

792 
01:05:05,212 --> 01:05:08,412 
and put 
thin clothes! 

793 
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,313 
As a tux! 

794 
01:05:15,663 --> 01:05:17,631 
Increased pulse! 

795 
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,864 
Blisters on the hands! 

796 
01:05:24,874 --> 01:05:26,832 
Now we're dead, man! 

797 
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:31,742 
We are dead! 

798 
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:57,298 
To go! 

799 
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,973 
Hey, man! 
Do you find water? 

800 
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:11,584 
Someone fix it! 

801 
01:06:21,497 --> 01:06:23,492 
Water has strange taste. 

802 
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,958 
The dog is 

803 
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:30,865 
What is it? 

804 
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,429 
Hey, wake up! 

805 
01:08:18,947 --> 01:08:20,314 
Lawrence! 

806 
01:08:21,953 --> 01:08:23,553 
Has disappeared! 

807 
01:08:24,754 --> 01:08:27,978 
I found myself in the ability 
to see miracles. 

808 
01:08:29,924 --> 01:08:32,218 
You should check this thing! 

809 
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:33,219 
Shut up! 

810 
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,266 
Somebody was 
loose balls. 

811 
01:08:47,143 --> 01:08:49,308 
I have two days? 
- YES! 

812 
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:50,909 
Sunday's 

813 
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:52,371 
No! 
- What? 

814 
01:08:52,872 --> 01:08:55,272 
No, Saturday! 

815 
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:57,273 
There is one days until Sunday! 

816 
01:08:57,374 --> 01:08:58,874 
Shut up! Sunday is! 

817 
01:08:59,975 --> 01:09:01,975 
When you see that chicken? 

818 
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,430 
Mark? 

819 
01:09:18,031 --> 01:09:19,931 
Maybe your right! 

820 
01:09:20,032 --> 01:09:21,632 
Of course I am! 

821 
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,133 
See Lawrence! 

822 
01:09:25,534 --> 01:09:27,834 
What a sad son of a bitch! 

823 
01:09:28,035 --> 01:09:29,735 
I can not guess it! 

824 
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,312 
I hear you! 

825 
01:09:33,056 --> 01:09:36,718 
Have sex with a 
man the rest of your life? 

826 
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:39,457 
It is not right! 

827 
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:40,958 
It is not natural! 

828 
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:44,892 
You know what, Marc? 
So I gave you the address 

829 
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:48,591 
neta in the forum. 
Leave it to your imagination. 

830 
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:52,630 
You find happiness as 
spend with a stranger after stranger? 

831 
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:54,975 
You can bet your ass! 

832 
01:09:56,111 --> 01:09:58,142 
Yack! 

833 
01:09:58,213 --> 01:10:00,141 
When you find 
right girl 

834 
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:04,042 
sex with her would be better, 
than you ever imagined! 

835 
01:10:04,985 --> 01:10:07,150 
What do you know was smotlyo? 

836 
01:10:07,156 --> 01:10:08,880 
You know, Mark? He is right! 

837 
01:10:09,057 --> 01:10:12,383 
Did you know that doing a 
umopomrachitelen sex 

838 
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:14,858 
bodies are in perfect harmony 

839 
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:17,059 
Your breath stops. 

840 
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,060 
At this point 

841 
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:21,761 
you say: - I can do 
  sex with her the rest of your life! 

842 
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:26,065 
Understand? 
This is love! 

843 
01:10:26,766 --> 01:10:27,766 
Marry that girl! 

844 
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:31,167 
I think your ass. 

845 
01:10:31,868 --> 01:10:34,468 
Smart, sexy ... stripper ... 

846 
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:35,969 
which sup! 

847 
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,970 
This is my boy! 

848 
01:10:50,165 --> 01:10:53,664 
Chris Mark is not right! 
You know, I know! 

849 
01:10:53,665 --> 01:10:56,565 
Dean! Super hero of 
love! 

850 
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:57,373 
Who knew? 

851 
01:10:57,374 --> 01:10:58,674 
Do not you say the truth! 

852 
01:10:59,775 --> 01:11:01,265 
What good will come out 
of this? 

853 
01:11:02,043 --> 01:11:02,934 
I do not know! 

854 
01:11:02,935 --> 01:11:05,335 
Take my feet 
and attach to the habit! 

855 
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,079 
You idiot. Why? 
- That is correct! 

856 
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,981 
I no longer trust? 

857 
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:21,155 
Follow me! 

858 
01:11:22,064 --> 01:11:24,097 
Somebody wants to 
argue with that? 

859 
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,567 
I do not think that's a good idea! 

860 
01:11:33,408 --> 01:11:36,773 
No! ... These are 
Mexican urban legends! 

861 
01:11:36,774 --> 01:11:39,074 
No, no! - Mind you 
documentaries ever? 

862 
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:40,875 
No! 
- Exactly! Nobody! 

863 
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:43,013 
To understand it! 

864 
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:50,778 
Wait! I'm Mark! 

865 
01:12:14,016 --> 01:12:16,348 
Wow, what ass! 
This place is scary! 

866 
01:12:20,989 --> 01:12:23,581 
Go bold! 
I wish I were you? 

867 
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:33,668 
Come to dance! 

868 
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,900 
And it was fun! 

869 
01:12:40,501 --> 01:12:42,601 
Mark, just 
leave me! 

870 
01:12:45,581 --> 01:12:46,981 
This is bullshit, man! 

871 
01:12:48,182 --> 01:12:49,208 
Are nonsense! 

872 
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:55,389 
Do not think that you 
will be sorry! 

873 
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,620 
Hi! 

874 
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:03,821 
How nice to hear your voice! 

875 
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:08,032 
I just wanted to call and 
I say, I miss you! 

876 
01:13:09,405 --> 01:13:10,936 
No, not drunk! 

877 
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:16,669 
I will marry! 

878 
01:13:20,783 --> 01:13:22,746 
There are rules 
do not touch? 

879 
01:14:12,325 --> 01:14:14,589 
You must be joking! 

880 
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,190 
Must match today! 

881 
01:14:20,591 --> 01:14:22,291 
But do not get, right? 

882 
01:14:28,492 --> 01:14:29,692 
Remember this? 

883 
01:14:30,293 --> 01:14:32,093 
This is my wedding? 

884 
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:35,990 
Pact! 

885 
01:14:40,929 --> 01:14:43,098 
If any of us 
failed in this madness 

886 
01:14:43,599 --> 01:14:46,859 
others will kidnap him, 
it will spoil and solid! 

887 
01:14:47,004 --> 01:14:50,995 
If checked, then 
it is meant to happen! 

888 
01:14:51,073 --> 01:14:52,673 
Bazikash you with me? 

889 
01:14:52,674 --> 01:14:56,466 
See. Signed 
by Mark and Chris! 

890 
01:14:56,644 --> 01:14:58,269 
On the napkin? 

891 
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,170 
You are crazy! 
- It was a promise! 

892 
01:15:02,871 --> 01:15:04,871 
You did it! 

893 
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:17,557 
Just shut up! 

894 
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:18,558 
So I spent! 

895 
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:21,359 
I said sorry! Do not be wet! 

896 
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,460 
Drop it! 

897 
01:15:22,937 --> 01:15:24,129 
Can be arranged! 

898 
01:15:24,407 --> 01:15:26,407 
Go! 
- Yes, liege! 

899 
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:34,408 
Give me that gun! 

900 
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:43,684 
Sorry buddy! 

901 
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,858 
But things are not always 
If as we hope! 

902 
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,930 
I need not 
say! 

903 
01:15:58,607 --> 01:16:00,707 
Very disappointing me! 

904 
01:16:01,008 --> 01:16:02,508 
I do not want to die! 

905 
01:16:03,109 --> 01:16:04,509 
Do not want to die? 

906 
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:08,647 
Why not think about it before 
to enter the bed of my daughter? 

907 
01:16:09,618 --> 01:16:11,650 
Even I am not allowed there! 

908 
01:16:12,788 --> 01:16:14,715 
You can simply 
We shoot! 

909 
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:15,916 
Of course he can! 

910 
01:16:17,017 --> 01:16:18,617 
You are in Mexico! 

911 
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:25,659 
Idiot! 

912 
01:16:25,834 --> 01:16:28,301 
Give me one reason 

913 
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:30,363 
do not cut your balls 

914 
01:16:30,964 --> 01:16:32,564 
and to add 
trophy to you? 

915 
01:16:35,076 --> 01:16:36,703 
And what ... 
Give me a minute ... 

916 
01:16:37,812 --> 01:16:38,875 
Wait! 

917 
01:16:39,915 --> 01:16:42,006 
This is just a 
big misunderstanding! 

918 
01:16:42,007 --> 01:16:43,607 
Will marry today! 

919 
01:16:45,087 --> 01:16:46,781 
And why are you here? 

920 
01:16:47,756 --> 01:16:49,356 
Very good question. 

921 
01:16:49,757 --> 01:16:52,248 
Yes, Mark, 
Why am I here? 

922 
01:16:54,089 --> 01:16:55,989 
Signed on the napkin! 

923 
01:16:57,966 --> 01:16:59,724 
Small stupid 
Game over, Mark! 

924 
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:02,437 
Get what you want. 

925 
01:17:03,104 --> 01:17:04,604 
I did not want that! 

926 
01:17:05,605 --> 01:17:08,964 
What then? 
What do you want? 

927 
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:10,739 
A beer. 

928 
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,840 
With a beer after work 
with my best friend! 

929 
01:17:16,016 --> 01:17:18,014 
You are married, 
I vanish! 

930 
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:24,952 
I'm a dog 
to life! 

931 
01:17:25,553 --> 01:17:27,153 
So I live. 

932 
01:17:28,654 --> 01:17:30,254 
This is evolution, my friend! 

933 
01:17:32,133 --> 01:17:33,464 
And love! 

934 
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:36,270 
Know what 
talk, right? 

935 
01:17:36,871 --> 01:17:38,571 
You were in love, right? 

936 
01:17:39,607 --> 01:17:40,707 
Many times! 

937 
01:17:41,108 --> 01:17:42,707 
I once! 

938 
01:17:44,245 --> 01:17:46,083 
Don Julio, please! 

939 
01:17:46,984 --> 01:17:48,984 
Lose, 
and when this happens, 

940 
01:17:49,884 --> 01:17:52,584 
is worse than death 

941 
01:17:53,188 --> 01:17:54,488 
God, shoot 
us now! 

942 
01:18:13,936 --> 01:18:16,033 
Look! 
Two love kittens! 

943 
01:18:16,634 --> 01:18:18,434 
Lord, help me! 

944 
01:18:18,847 --> 01:18:19,974 
Whats up, 
the hell? 

945 
01:18:20,748 --> 01:18:22,375 
Meet with Alex! 

946 
01:18:22,418 --> 01:18:25,309 
I told him about our work 

947 
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,610 
And he did great. 
Kefish me, dude! 

948 
01:18:27,611 --> 01:18:29,748 
You kiddin 'me? 
Little shit! 

949 
01:18:38,499 --> 01:18:40,228 
Who would have thought so 
little substance 

950 
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:43,900 
Honey! 

951 
01:18:44,973 --> 01:18:47,370 
what are you doing here? 
Do not call me baby! 

952 
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,599 
This is because I lied! 

953 
01:18:50,712 --> 01:18:52,745 
Delayed by 15 minutes! 

954 
01:18:53,315 --> 01:18:55,573 
Sorry. 
On my watch is 

955 
01:18:56,251 --> 01:18:58,648 
Do not cover you. 
It is not like him kidnapped. 

956 
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,482 
No! 
- Yes! 

957 
01:19:02,356 --> 01:19:05,281 
I passed the test? 
- Yes! 

958 
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:06,320 
Test? 

959 
01:19:07,095 --> 01:19:09,393 
Test Pact 
Who cares? 

960 
01:19:10,164 --> 01:19:12,159 
Know about the pact? 

961 
01:19:12,132 --> 01:19:13,291 
Of course! 

962 
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,237 
Before or after you called? 

963 
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:17,238 
Long before that. 

964 
01:19:19,906 --> 01:19:22,934 
You do not even like it? 
- No question about it! 

965 
01:19:23,011 --> 01:19:25,338 
And for us! 

966 
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:32,045 
Can not be fun, 
just because you are married? 

967 
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,118 
What do you have? 

968 
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:44,098 
Are you ready or not? 

969 
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:51,866 
I love you, baby. 

970 
01:19:59,146 --> 01:20:02,610 
I will tell her! 
- No need! 

971 
01:20:02,784 --> 01:20:03,884 
Should. 

972 
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:08,280 
Do not you! 

973 
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,419 
Repeat after me: 

974 
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:18,421 
I do not fuck anyone! 

975 
01:20:19,298 --> 01:20:22,630 
But! 
- But no. Just a joke. 

976 
01:20:23,937 --> 01:20:25,673 
You lied to me? 

977 
01:20:26,574 --> 01:20:28,574 
No, but only sleeping 
nothing more! 

978 
01:20:29,976 --> 01:20:32,206 
You asshole! 
- I know! 

979 
01:20:42,086 --> 01:20:45,419 
Friends and families are 
gathered here 

980 
01:20:45,561 --> 01:20:48,261 
To celebrate love 
between these two 

981 
01:20:48,262 --> 01:20:51,896 
to be included in 
holy sacrament of marriage 

982 
01:20:51,897 --> 01:20:53,297 
For Kelly and Chris! 

983 
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,798 
As second assistant to the best man, 
  I would like to propose a toast. 

984 
01:21:03,879 --> 01:21:06,879 
The essence of true 
love is the security 

985 
01:21:08,082 --> 01:21:09,715 
And I know you are safe! 

986 
01:21:10,952 --> 01:21:12,585 
And that is all 
you want! 

987 
01:21:12,753 --> 01:21:13,986 
Smile! 

988 
01:21:20,156 --> 01:21:22,556 
Mark, what Pyuri? 

989 
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:25,857 
Ancient history! 

990 
01:21:26,358 --> 01:21:29,458 
I think two days before 
is not ancient history. 

991 
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:33,259 
Depends on the measure. 

992 
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,860 
A little. 
I asked her to help us! 

993 
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:40,861 
Then suffer. 

994 
01:21:41,962 --> 01:21:43,762 
I wish. 
- What? 

995 
01:21:43,763 --> 01:21:46,063 
I asked it to pretends! 

996 
01:21:49,464 --> 01:21:52,864 
Mr. Rocko, I know 
permission to call your daughter? 

997 
01:21:54,065 --> 01:21:57,065 
My daughter can go with you 
he wants only ... I love her! 

998 
01:21:57,766 --> 01:21:59,266 
Go, boy! 

999 
01:22:00,235 --> 01:22:02,462 
Rocko, you know that it is not your 
very daughter? 

1000 
01:22:03,237 --> 01:22:06,169 
I know, I was so screwy, 
they do not want to lose motivation. 

1001 
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,470 
This is it. 

1002 
01:22:14,571 --> 01:22:16,171
