318
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:32,500
Look, I signed up because I wanted
to test myself, okay? That's all.

319
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,900
Besides, what else should I suppose

Your mother and I have did pretty,
good things in this department at least.

328
00:26:03,335 --> 00:26:05,400
Shit, your brother, too.

00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,200
Yes, Aaron was the best then.

330
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,000
Now however, looks like hell.

331
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,200
And do not tell your mother
that you saw him, okay?

332
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:19,600
Just don't.

333
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,100
She asks too many fucking questions.

334
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,200

335
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,900

- You want a beer?
- No, I'm fine.

490
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,765
Pour gas on the asphalt, right?

491
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,700
And fire it up and then dig a hole
while the road is still soft.

492
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:43,600
Then they bury the bomb and cover up back
with the taar

493
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:47,100
and detonate when you pass over it, man.

494
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,565
This is a mess.

495
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,700
And we were at Fallujah too.

496
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:54,400
It was real fighting, man.

497
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:00,300
RPG and mortars, IED's,
snipers fires and other shit.

498
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,900
A little of this, little bit of that.

We are the masters of the enemy.
We are saviors of my life.

506
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,600
Get me in the shade, man.

507

I want to play Grand Theft Auto.

509
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,500
