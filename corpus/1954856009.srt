1
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,432
Ohh.

2
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,364
          Help me out.

3
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,436
         Come on, Mel,
    let's take another shot.

4
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,738
            Oh, oh.

5
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,303
              Hey.
      How's it going, man?

6
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,637
             -Good.
          -Good, good.

7
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,639
         -How are you?
         -Great, great.

8
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,444
         -Young Daniel.
       -How are you, sir?

9
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,347
   -Good, man. How you doing?
          -Good, good.

10
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,082
             Whoo!

11
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,052
- Whoops!

12
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,987
        Is it all gone?

13
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,558
         You are drunk.

14
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,595
     I got a full cup now.

15
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,396
      Mnh. Can you give me
          a ride home?

16
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,764
      I didn't drive here.

17
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,333
    I'm going to Dan's now.

18
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,767
   That's okay, you can just
    drop me off on the way.

19
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,069
         No, you're not
      on the way to Dan's.

20
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,570
       You're on the way
          to my place.

21
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,906
           Yes, I am.
            Please.

22
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,574
      I mean, it would be
         so much easier

23
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,443
   if I just lived with Dan.

24
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,812
     Okay, well, fuck you.
  You're giving me a ride home

25
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,747
     because there's no one
      else at this party.

26
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,585
          So serious.
     Will you listen to me!

27
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,820
       I'm trying to have
    a serious conversation.

28
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,355
    You never listen to me.

29
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,723
          -Oh, really?
      -I'm gonna marry Dan

30
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,625
      and have his babies
      by the time I'm 26.

31
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,493
    Oh, yeah? Well, does Dan
   know about this marriage?

32
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,462
   Do you know -- Do you know
 how long we've been together?

33
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,697
           -How long?
        -Are you ready?

34
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,801
             Boom.

35
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,471
       Six fuckin' years.

36
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,672
             Shit!

37
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,040
            I know!

38
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,984
           Mnh. Mnh.

39
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,453
            Oh, God.

40
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,788
              Oh!

41
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,989
       Oh, I missed you.

42
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,257
            Mm-hmm.

43
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,528
     Are you trying to take
        advantage of me?

44
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,129
             Yeah.

45
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,597
             Okay.

46
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,505
      Shut up and kiss me.

47
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,807
              Mmm.

48
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,141
         -Drunk, drunk.
    -Shut -- I'm not drunk.

49
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,743
    How much did you drink?

50
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,778
    I didn't drink anything.

51
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,947
    That's a bold-faced lie.

52
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,782
"Bold-faced"?

53
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,651
             Bold.

54
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,921
   Tell me about your night.

55
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,656
          Well, mmm...

56
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,459
       You left me, so I
     hung out with Jessica

57
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:01,960
     and she was making out
         with this guy.

58
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,528
       That's very nice.

59
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,896
       Yeah, and then...

60
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,465
      The party was shit.

61
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,866
         Everyone left.
         It was dying.

62
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,103
     It was boring, so Jess
     asked for a ride home,

63
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,637
   -I gave her a ride home --
          -You drove?

64
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,139
        And then, I came
          to see you.

65
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,574
        You drove here?

66
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,975
        Yeah, it's fine.

67
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,211
      What the fuck, Mel?
      Don't do that shit.

68
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,679
        Shh! It's okay.

69
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,047
        It's so stupid.
         It's not okay.

70
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,749
    I wasn't -- I'm not even
        that drunk, Dan.

71
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,684
     -You're<i> really</i> drunk.
     -I'm not really drunk.

72
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,018
        Just promise me,
           next time,

73
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,787
        you will call me
    if you're fucking drunk.

74
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,489
           -Call you?
    -And you're not gonna be

75
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,724
     an idiot and drive all
across town to drop Jessica off

76
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,992
 -and then come back over here.
     -I wasn't the only one

77
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,527
       who was drinking.
       You were drinking.

78
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,828
    Stop. Can you keep your
      voice down, please?

79
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,096
          My roommates
      are trying to sleep.

80
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,965
    What, I'm gonna call you
        and wake you up?

81
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,733
      No, you're sleeping.
    I'm perfectly capable --

82
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,002
 It doesn't matter. Just don't
do it. Don't be a fucking idiot.

83
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,203
             What?!

84
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,772
          Don't do it.
          Just don't.

85
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,106
             What?

86
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,674
         Fuck you, man.

87
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,144
     -Where are you going?
        -I'm going home,

88
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,678
      'cause, apparently,
     I'm not welcome here.

89
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,914
- How are you getting home?

90
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,683
   Stop. You're not driving.
        -Don't touch me!

91
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,685
    You're not gonna fucking
  drunk-drive right now, Mel.

92
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,554
          Get off me!

93
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,890
             Fuck.

94
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,258
              Ow!

95
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,227
      -What the fuck, Mel?
     -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

96
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,896
    Don't fucking touch me.

97
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,799
           Oh! Fuck.

98
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,635
         It hurts. Ow!

99
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,103
              Hey.

100
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,614
             Fuck!

101
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,118
I'm sorry, Dan.
           I'm sorry.

102
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,593
- Great, you're dressed.

103
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,994
          Hi, I'm Dan.

104
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,596
       Nice to meet you.

105
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,864
            I'm Mel.
            Melanie.

106
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:49,334
    Okay, all the hard work
         has been done.

107
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,136
         It should heal
          on its own.

108
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,838
         You don't even
     have to see a doctor.

109
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,105
           All right.

110
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,640
          Okay, great.

111
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,742
    So how did this happen?

112
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:01,279
             Um...

113
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,914
           I tripped.

114
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,083
     I just tripped and hit
     my head on my dresser.

115
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,651
             Okay.

116
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,721
   Okay, guys, that's pretty
    much all I need to know.

117
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,958
       -Okay. Thank you.
      -All right. Thanks.

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,761
           My shoes.

119
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,642
              Hey.
         How you doing?

120
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,943
            Yo, yo.

121
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,211
     I pulled those records
          you wanted.

122
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,980
             Cool.
           Thank you.

123
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,249
   The shipping labels should
     be printing right now,

124
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,284
     and if you could just
   get those all squared away

125
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,785
         and send them
          to that list

126
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,621
         of journalists
          I sent you.

127
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,989
             Cool.
          You got it.

128
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,725
Cool hat.

129
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,293
           Thank you.

130
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,028
           Hey, wait.
       You want a coffee?

131
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,364
            -Coffee.
    -I need one really bad.

132
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,132
          I feel that.

133
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,700
            Perfect.

134
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,704
       So what's the deal
     with your hat, anyway?

135
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,706
       It's 100° outside.

136
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,879
              -Ow.
          -Holy shit!

137
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,949
--What happened?

138
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,818
        I hit my head on
     my dresser last night.

139
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,420
        Were you drunk,
         or something?

140
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,188
              No.

141
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,057
            No, no,
     but my girlfriend was.

142
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,692
             What?

143
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,794
     We got into this fight
    'cause she was drunk --

144
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:26,298
   very, very, very drunk --
   and wanted to drive home.

145
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,900
     So I was fighting her
 for her keys and hit my head.

146
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,237
And she pushed you?

147
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,673
       It wasn't that big
       of a deal, really.

148
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,408
            Uh-huh.

149
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,745
   I don't know, that sounds
       pretty fucked up.

150
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,383
         Imagine if you
     had done that to her.

151
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,019
         I don't know.

152
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,754
      Did you bleed a lot?

153
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,189
        Yeah, there was
        a lot of blood.

154
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,258
    I spent the whole night
     in the emergency room.

155
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,793
       It was really fun.

156
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,861
          That sucks.

157
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,764
    Well, a bunch of us are
     gonna go see that band

158
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,333
      Fun Friends tonight.
       You want to come?

159
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,734
           Oh, nice.

160
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,935
    Yeah, Mark keeps talking
          about that.

161
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,072
            Mm-hmm.
         Well, text me

162
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,406
     if you want me to put
        you on the list.

163
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,808
             Okay.

164
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,377
       I have to go back
            to work.

165
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,012
             Pshew.

166
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,780
            Pew pew.

167
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,294
         Good morning,
     ladies and gentlemen.

168
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,729
         Good morning!

169
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,231
        Are we all ready
     for a very great day?

170
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,866
              Yes.

171
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,235
   I see some of you peeking
     over into the corner.

172
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,437
   -Is there somebody there?
             -Yes.

173
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,072
        Are you curious
       about who that is?

174
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,273
              Yes!

175
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,009
    Yes? I hear some yeses.

176
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:47,245
  So I would like to introduce
       to you Miss Clark.

177
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,280
     Miss Clark is gonna be
     spending today with us

178
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,916
  and she's gonna be spending
   a couple of weeks with us.

179
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,185
    Can you all give a very,
   very warm welcome and say

180
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,954
       "Hi, Miss Clark"?

181
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,922
        Hi, Miss Clark!

182
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,958
            Amazing.

183
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,861
         So tell me --
    tell me about your plan.

184
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,796
         Tell me about
    where you are in school

185
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,097
   and what you're thinking.

186
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,133
      Well, I just started
        my junior year,

187
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,902
       so I got one more
      after this and then,

188
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,170
        I'm gonna do it,
        I'm gonna teach.

189
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,371
           -You are?
             -Yeah.

190
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,906
     What are you thinking?

191
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,275
       Do you want to do
     elementary education?

192
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,977
    I think so, I really do.
      I just love the kids

193
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,179
      and I love how open
        their minds are

194
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,881
     at this age, you know?

195
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,849
   Yeah, there's this flowing
    creativity all the time.

196
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,885
     Exactly, and they just
          say things.

197
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,987
   You were great with them.
  You were really good today.

198
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,057
            Thanks.

199
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,427
           Oh, uh-oh.
          There we go.

200
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,096
       -Yeah! Beautiful.
 -Domino did not make cookies.

201
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,065
 -Did Navador make you cookies?
              -No.

202
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,966
       Who makes cookies?
      Topo makes cookies.

203
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,168
Topo makes the cookies.

204
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,502
    Dan, have you met Jess?

205
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,171
     No, I haven't. I just
     saw the show tonight.

206
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,206
        It was so good.
     You guys are amazing.

207
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,474
            Awesome.
     Thank you for coming.

208
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,942
       -Dan's our intern.
           -Oh, cool.

209
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,177
       Have you ever had
           an intern?

210
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,545
              No.
     That would be awesome.

211
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,413
      Oh, my God, we need
     to get you an intern.

212
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,449
             -Yeah.
    -Interns are incredible.

213
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,050
        Will you do a me
            a favor?

214
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,919
         Will you drink
    the rest of your drink?

215
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,987
           -This one?
        -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

216
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,023
            Mm-hmm.

217
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,591
       Did you see that?

218
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,593
          -I saw that.
        -That's amazing.

219
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,462
     He did that for free.

220
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,930
    You got credit, though.

221
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,065
     You got course credit
           for that.

222
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,400
        Thank you, yeah.

223
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,903
    So, um, Jess, your tour
        is winding down.

224
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,473
   Yes, we are about to play
   our last show in Brooklyn.

225
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,942
            Really?
       Where in Brooklyn?

226
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,210
         The music hall
        of Williamsburg.

227
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,146
       Oh, that's great.

228
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,380
    We're so excited, yeah.

229
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,916
  We've got -- We've got plans
         for Brooklyn.

230
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,518
        We have designs
          on Brooklyn.

231
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,919
             Cool.

232
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,988
             Yeah.
    Can't say too much yet,

233
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,323
       but the next time
    you come through there,

234
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,291
- we'll take care of you.

235
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,193
          Soon enough.
         Jess, come on.

236
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,028
    I want to introduce you
         to some folks.

237
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,230
       Nice to meet you.

238
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,432
    Yeah, nice to meet you,
           too, Jess.

239
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,003
              Mnh!
     I saw Dan at the show.

240
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,405
     He was with all of the
   like record-label people.

241
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,241
             Yeah.
       He didn't say hi.

242
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:59,144
             What?

243
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:03,381
Yeah, he was, like, in the back
 with them all, and...you know.

244
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,384
     I mean, he waved, but,
     they're kind of weird.

245
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,020
       They kind of just
        make me nervous.

246
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,388
         -I don't know.
       -They're so weird.

247
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,157
They make me feel
       so uncomfortable.

248
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,192
  I'm so happy you said that.
       It's not just me.

249
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,394
              -No.
         -That's weird.

250
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:21,599
      Yeah, I saw him and
   I was like, "Hey, there."

251
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,669
    You know, I don't know.

252
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,005
     Hey, do you ever think
   about dating anybody else,

253
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,206
        other than Dan?

254
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,407
              No.

255
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,109
        I mean, come on.

256
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,144
         Come on, what?
           I'm happy.

257
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,281
    Don't you ever feel like
      you're missing out?

258
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,249
      You don't get bored?

259
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,218
    -No, I don't get bored.
     -You've been with him
          for so long.

260
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,153
        How do you keep
      things interesting?

261
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,022
     Yeah, like do you ever
          watch porn?

262
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,458
            -What?!
         -I'm serious!

263
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,060
     You know, spice it up
         a little bit.

264
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,428
              Hey!

265
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,629
     She does have a point.

266
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,765
          I'm kidding.
     You know I'm kidding.

267
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,568
              Wow.

268
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,937
         Are you good?

269
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,173
            Ahhhhhh!

270
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,976
     Did you tell 'em where
   all the bodies are buried?

271
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,378
         Oh, right. Oh.

272
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,580
          Cheers, guy.

273
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,281
            Cheers.

274
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,585
              So.

275
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,053
              So.

276
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,288
         You want to do
     the lanterns for Jess?

277
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,190
    Fuck, yeah, I want to do
     the lanterns for Jess.

278
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,725
    You are gonna love this.

279
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,328
    Go round up the troops.
     We'll be out in five.

280
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,968
     Thanks for inviting me
           over, man.

281
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,236
       I'm glad you came.

282
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,671
        Having a blast.

283
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,540
         Um, so tell me
        about Dog Water.

284
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,409
        Did you give it
           a listen?

285
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,111
      I gave it a listen.

286
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,546
    Yeah, I mean, you know,

287
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,715
    they were playing a lot
  of shows that I was going to

288
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,284
    and they just graduated
           last year,

289
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,652
  but they're sticking around.

290
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,154
     I know they're fucking
       working at it, so.

291
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,690
   I want you to keep an eye
     on them for me, okay?

292
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,626
           Every time
     they record something,

293
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,662
  if they're playing out live,
       you come grab me,

294
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,063
     I'll go check 'em out
           with you.

295
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,632
             Cool.

296
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,133
        Let's go set off
       some motherfuckin'

297
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,235
       Chinese lanterns!

298
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,583
             Shit.
      Thank you very much.

299
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,244
            <i> Oh, hey.</i>

300
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,180
       <i> I don't want to be</i>
     <i> on camera and eating.</i>

301
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,115
     <i> So what? You look cute</i>
         <i> with no pants.</i>

302
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,085
      <i> 'Cause I'm at home.</i>

303
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,163
             <i> Yeah!</i>

304
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:08,132
  <i> Guess what -- I'm a fuckin'</i>
      <i> filthy fuckin' slut.</i>

305
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,334
           <i> Yeah. Mmm.</i>

306
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,440
Hi-i. How are you?

307
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,809
I'm<i> really</i> drunk.

308
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,181
        Someone had fun.

309
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,516
 Mm-hmm. I gotta show you this
   band Mark just showed me.

310
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,118
      No, not another one.

311
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,386
     You're gonna like it.
     You're gonna like it.

312
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,388
      No, I'm sure I will.
       Play it tomorrow.

313
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,190
          What's your
        fuckin' problem?

314
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,658
      -Tomorrow. Come on.
    -Let me play it for you.

315
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,227
     Just play it tomorrow.

316
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,795
         Dan, come on.

317
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,565
      You're being weird.

318
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:44,369
          See, look --

319
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,805
--What the fuck?

320
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,741
         What the fuck?

321
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,244
        You watch porn?

322
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,612
   Were you just about to...?
              Oh!

323
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,180
      Just about to what?

324
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,616
         No, I don't --

325
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,251
       They said they --

326
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,420
    They said you were gonna
  get bored, so I just -- I --

327
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,223
          Your friends
         are so stupid.

328
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,228
       Do you watch porn?

329
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,796
             Uh...

330
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,298
           Sometimes.

331
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,137
         -You watch --
    -No shit, I watch porn.
          I'm a dude.

332
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,539
          -Oh, my God.
     -Does that bother you?

333
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,642
   Are you bored during sex?

334
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,844
No.

335
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,413
         Are<i> you</i> bored?

336
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,314
No!

337
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,916
       Just relax, okay?

338
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,384
   If you want to watch porn,
       we can watch porn.

339
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,752
       It might be weird.

340
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,487
       Mnh-mnh. I'm good.

341
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,557
        It might be fun.

342
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,730
             What?

343
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,368
              No.

344
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,905
           All right.

345
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,176
     I'm gonna go wash up.

346
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,786
        So what'd you do
           at Mark's?

347
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,255
         It was so fun.

348
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,224
  You should've come with me.

349
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,226
     You would've had fun.
    It was like a big party.

350
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,427
            Mm-hmm.

351
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,929
    And the band was there.
            So good.

352
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,630
  And then Mark is definitely
        gonna sign them.

353
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,832
        And guess what.

354
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,366
What?

355
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:29,373
       Um, Amanda told me
        that they don't,

356
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,776
        um, keep interns
      for more than a year

357
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,378
      if they're not gonna
        hire them, so...

358
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,214
            Really?

359
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,849
         -Yeah, but --
     -Wait, she said that?

360
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,951
   I mean, yeah, but she just
      said that, I mean --

361
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,287
    Well, she wouldn't<i> just</i>
         say it, right?

362
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,990
          I'm hoping.
         I don't know.

363
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,892
        She's my friend,
    so she's hoping for me.

364
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,360
    We'll see what happens.

365
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,996
        That's awesome.
    That's fucking awesome.

366
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,998
            Mm-hmm.

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,567
              Ugh.

368
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,536
          Don't smoke.

369
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,538
     It's not good for you,
         'cause, then,

370
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,406
         I'm not gonna
       kiss you anymore.

371
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,442
         You don't like
          kissing me?

372
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,745
              No.

373
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,449
    Except for when you wear
         the cat pants.

374
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,885
     The cat pajama pants.
       This is very hot.

375
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,753
      Where'd you get this
      little outfit, hmm,

376
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,622
          some sort of
        lingerie store?

377
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,491
            Really?

378
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,393
        Yeah, I like it.

379
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,695
      You look real fine.

380
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,680
     How are your classes?

381
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,948
         They're good.

382
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,918
     I'm really sort of...

383
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,587
      Getting senioritis,
     you know what I mean?

384
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,689
       Done with school.
   I just want to be working.

385
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,525
     But the internship is
         going so well.

386
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,993
             -Good.
  -I'm just learning so much.

387
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,864
      Everybody is really
       gifted over there.

388
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,500
     Hopefully, there'll be
     a job when I graduate.

389
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,302
     No one's said anything
          yet, but --

390
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:07,038
     There are some labels
          in New York

391
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,674
      that I'm interested
            in, but,

392
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,676
     I have to be here next
     year for Mel, anyway,

393
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,811
        so I think it's
      gonna work out well.

394
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,947
      Timing will be good.

395
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,548
     Well, you know, I know
    we haven't really talked

396
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,884
          about this,
     but I want you to know

397
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,621
    that your father and I,
     we'd like to help you,

398
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,956
          if you want
        to leave Texas.

399
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,591
     We would pay your rent
      and your expenses --

400
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:27,858
            Really?

401
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,827
       For a few months,
     'til you got settled,

402
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,529
     like we did with your
        brother, and --

403
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,730
            Hi-i-i!

404
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,732
              -Hi.
              -Hi!

405
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,468
        -Sorry I'm late.
      -It's okay. Sweetie!

406
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,503
     I had to wait 'til all
  the kids got picked up. Hi.

407
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,705
              Hey.

408
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,373
              Ooh.

409
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,075
        What's going on?

410
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,043
           Not much.
         I'm starving.

411
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,645
             -Yeah.
             -Good.

412
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,980
        Everything okay?

413
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,381
             Yeah.

414
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,649
             Great.

415
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,452
           Very good.

416
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,954
      Honestly, you know,
     every time we talked,

417
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,457
 I told your mom that I thought
  she should sell that house,

418
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,026
  even though the real-estate
   market was crap, you know.

419
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,462
      Yeah, I don't know.
       So many memories.

420
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,897
       I can't even deal
            with it.

421
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,866
            I know.
       Makes me sad, too.

422
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,769
    I'm gonna miss her being
        right next door.

423
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,971
           -You know?
          -I love you.

424
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,573
             -Bye.
       -Thanks for lunch.

425
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,975
        -Okay, sweetie.
             -Bye!

426
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,823
             -What?
    -Amanda just texted me.

427
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,759
   Everybody's at the condos.

428
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,027
          Sounds fun.

429
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,928
      I don't want to go.
      The pool's so nasty.

430
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,630
         What the fuck?

431
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,766
    You were just saying how
   badly you want to go out.

432
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,000
       Now you don't want
             to go.

433
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,435
           Not there.

434
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,170
           -Why<i> not?</i>
   -I don't want to go there.

435
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,639
              Why?
    Give me one good reason.

436
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,908
  -Because I don't want to go.
   -That's not a good reason.

437
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,444
  And I have nothing to wear.
     I can't go like this.

438
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,146
    Why not? Why do you need
        a fucking outfit

439
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,048
           for every
      different occasion?

440
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,183
      I'm not gonna go see
     all those record-label
    people and go like this.

441
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,819
 Who do you think these people
are? You think they give a shit?

442
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,487
      They're all gonna be
     really drunk, anyway.

443
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,189
         Let's just go
      and have a good time

444
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,657
      and get the fuck out
         of this house.

445
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,192
            Please.

446
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,760
    I have school tomorrow.

447
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,663
     Since when do you give
      a shit about school?

448
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,433
  I give a shit about school.
       What do you mean?

449
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:16,701
      I have better grades
           than you.

450
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,436
          We're going.
        Today's the day.

451
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,704
      -It's gonna happen.
           -Mnh-mnh.

452
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,073
          -Yes, it is!
              -No!

453
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,974
           -Come on.
         -For how long?

454
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,944
     One drink. One drink,
           and if you

455
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,880
   are hating the experience,
         we can leave.

456
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,583
     And that's a promise.

457
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,219
            Please.
        I'm going crazy.

458
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,788
      I have cabin fever.

459
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,157
      -I'm gonna kill you.
           -Ah! Stop.

460
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,126
        You're so heavy.

461
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,861
         So, can we go?

462
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,163
         Say "please."

463
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,233
       Please, can we go?

464
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,801
     Fine, but you owe me.

465
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,070
Yes, yes. Yes.

466
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,172
    All right, let's do it.
           Let's go.

467
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,807
    You owe me. I'm serious.
         Like bigtime.

468
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,577
     Okay, really, whatever
     you want, you got it.

469
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,713
     You just made my day.

470
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,982
    Oh, you gotta carry me.

471
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,851
     Okay, I'm getting up.
        I'm getting up.

472
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,052
           Ah-oh-oh!

473
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,525
            Help me.

474
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,060
        Milady. Come on.

475
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,730
          You got it?

476
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,133
         Dan! Whoo-hoo!

477
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,201
          Whoo-oo-oo!

478
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,603
             Danny!

479
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,004
        Danny, come on.

480
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,606
       You're really not
         gonna come in?

481
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:30,875
              No.

482
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,810
              -Hi!
        -That's Amanda.

483
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,011
              Hi.

484
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,613
        Get in, get in.

485
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,181
       Dan's girlfriend,
   come on, get in the pool.

486
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,682
          Yes, do it.

487
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,084
          Whoo-oo-oo!

488
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,654
     Can you get me a beer?

489
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:44,922
       You got it, yeah.

490
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,257
          Dan, get us
         a lot of beer.

491
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,658
      Just keep it coming.

492
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,927
             -Hey.
              -Hi.

493
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,729
          How are ya?

494
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:52,997
         I'm all right.

495
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,167
      Um, are we gonna go?

496
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,536
           Right now?

497
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,137
      You said one drink.

498
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,539
              Oh.

499
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,840
     You're not having fun?

500
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:05,976
   I'm just tired of dealing.
            School.

501
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,211
         I understand.
           I just --

502
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,847
   I feel like it's important
         that I'm here

503
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,149
       with these people.

504
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,818
      For work, you know?

505
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,052
             Yeah.

506
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,588
      That's cool. I mean,
       you stay, I'll go.

507
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,824
           -You sure?
       -Yeah, it's fine.

508
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:22,560
      Can you just text me
       when you get home,

509
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,629
     so I know you're safe?
          I love you.

510
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,131
          I love you.

511
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,402
          See ya, kid.

512
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,105
       Oh, look at them!

513
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,340
       Shut the fuck up.

514
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,346
     Are you gonna get in?

515
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,881
            Come on,
       let's go swimming!

516
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,182
        Come on, get in.

517
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,650
            Come on,
       let's go swimming.

518
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,820
          I gotta go.
       Sorry, I gotta go.

519
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,088
            But nice
       to meet you guys.

520
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,224
         It was so nice
          to meet you!

521
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,893
      -Have a good night.
             -Bye!

522
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,882
          Do you think
      we're gonna get sick

523
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,216
      because of how Mark
      threw up in the pool

524
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,751
only about three weeks
         ago?

525
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,787
        I totally forgot
          about that.

526
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,055
       A lot of hot dogs.

527
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,991
   Projectile-vomit hot dogs.

528
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,193
         -15 hot dogs.
     -Just whole hot dogs.

529
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,394
          Sliding in.

530
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,165
        It was horrible.

531
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,702
       It was impressive.
   I was -- I was impressed.

532
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,271
        Yeah, no wonder
        your girlfriend

533
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,839
          didn't want
      to hang out with us.

534
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:45,676
    No, but why did she go?

535
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:46,911
         She has class
        in the morning.

536
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,245
             Yeah?

537
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,947
  I mean, I have fucking class
      in the morning, too,

538
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:53,817
    but she's a good student
     and I'm just a fuckup.

539
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,153
             -Yeah.
      -I'm just fucked up.

540
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,322
     How long have you guys
         been together?

541
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,723
            6 years.

542
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,692
Whew!

543
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,061
         What is that?
            "Whew!"

544
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,931
     Everyone says, "Wow,"
            "whoa."

545
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,666
       'Cause it's really
          a long time.

546
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,068
            I know.

547
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,336
      Wait, does that mean
          that she is

548
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,138
      the only girl you've
       ever had sex with?

549
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,373
--What?

550
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,876
             Uh...

551
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,444
       Well, well, well.

552
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:24,448
    Wait, uh, can I ask you
      a personal question?

553
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,151
        When you've been
        seeing somebody

554
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:30,854
      for that many years,
   is the sex still any good

555
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,723
        or is it, like,
         pretty boring?

556
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,793
    Don't even ask me that,
          please. I --

557
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:38,729
      There's no way to --
          just don't.

558
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:41,265
   Oh, I've just been single
          for so long

559
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,068
   that I cannot even<i> imagine</i>
         what it's like

560
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,071
        to be with, like
        in a long-term,

561
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:51,709
     one-person, committed.

562
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,777
        Just don't know.

563
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,112
        I really can't.

564
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,714
I really can't.

565
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,816
           You know?

566
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,051
      Wait, I'm just gonna
       speak freely here.

567
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,286
       Just speak freely.

568
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,487
             Okay.

569
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,889
       The thing is that,

570
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,358
            when --
  whenever I'm dating anyone,

571
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,028
       even if it's like
     for like three months

572
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,231
          or a month,
       or even a week --

573
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,502
       I just like, I get
    so addicted to the sex.

574
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,271
     All I can think about,
         all the time.

575
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,140
          I can't get
         anything done.

576
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,977
       I become terrible
     at my job. Seriously.

577
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,312
           And then,
        when I'm single,

578
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:32,182
   I just pretty much forget
        that sex exists

579
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,417
altogether.

580
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,419
          Really? Wow.

581
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,388
            -I know.
             -Whoa.

582
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,856
              Oh.

583
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,528
        I don't know why
        I told you that.

584
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,166
             Brrr!

585
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,005
           I'm cold.

586
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,844
            Oh, God.

587
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,248
             Fuck.

588
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,150
     I'm sorry I did that.

589
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,384
          That's okay.

590
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:08,786
       -I'm really sorry.
         -That's okay.

591
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,054
         I don't know.
         I don't know.

592
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,321
         No, it's okay.
           It's okay.

593
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,857
         -I'm so sorry.
      -It's totally okay.

594
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,159
     -Fuck. I'm so stupid.
             -Dan.

595
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,428
     Real smooth, you know?
             Fuck!

596
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,029
           It's okay.

597
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,265
    It's not like I haven't
    thought about it before.

598
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,033
           It's fine.

599
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,502
Look, I like -- really like you,
     but I really like you

600
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,571
       as a friend and I,
   you know, I don't think --

601
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,841
      I don't want things
     to get too confusing.

602
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,042
         Yeah, totally.

603
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,410
     It's fine. We're fine.

604
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,145
      We're friends, yeah?

605
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,814
             Yeah.

606
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,516
    Okay, I'm gonna go now.

607
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,185
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

608
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,920
           All right.

609
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,296
            Mmm. Hi.

610
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,603
     You got me breakfast?

611
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,605
            Mm-hmm.

612
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:39,543
      Wait, why didn't you
   come back here last night?

613
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:42,012
        I had texted you
    and you didn't respond.

614
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,047
         I didn't want
        to wake you up.

615
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,315
         Are you going
      to the record label?

616
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,551
            Mm-hmm,
       but I don't think

617
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,386
     they're gonna need me
      for that long, so...

618
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,021
             Okay.

619
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,422
      Can we hang out when
    you're done with class?

620
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,458
            Mm-hmm.

621
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,529
              Hey,

622
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:01,465
     was that party any fun
    last night after I left?

623
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,667
       No, it was stupid.

624
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,235
        I should've just
         left with you.

625
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,271
Obviously.

626
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,141
     Thanks for bringing me
           breakfast.

627
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,679
        You're so sweet.

628
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,481
     Why are you the best?

629
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,550
         I don't know.

630
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,318
              Hmm.

631
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,227
          I gotta go.

632
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,599
         What's wrong?

633
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:39,336
            Nothing.

634
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,638
        What's going on?

635
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,576
            Nothing.

636
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,511
            Nothing.

637
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:29,019
         So, you know,
      how was your night?

638
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,454
              Oh.

639
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:31,722
           The lady.
       What was her name?

640
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,123
           Michelle.

641
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,391
        Oh, it was good.

642
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,093
       We went to dinner
         and I took her

643
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:38,262
          to a movie,
       that whole thing,

644
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,630
     and then, we had sex.

645
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,500
          Nice, dude.
         You got laid.

646
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,202
             Yeah.
       Yeah, I got laid.

647
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,536
         "We had sex."

648
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,438
      -Was it a nice date?
       -It was very nice.

649
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,741
      You gonna call her?

650
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,175
             Um...

651
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,443
        Was she a babe?

652
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,479
     Was she a smoke show?

653
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,414
             -Stop!
  -She was quite a smoke show.

654
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,049
         Where's Becca?

655
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,550
  I don't know. I called her.
       She didn't answer.

656
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,152
       You got pictures?

657
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,354
    Wait, why the fuck isn't
     Becca here right now?

658
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,523
  Why -- Why isn't Becca here?

659
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,791
          Mnh-mnh-mnh.

660
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,060
         Hold on. Shh!
     Fuck, my phone's dead.

661
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,361
    Can I borrow your phone?

662
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,562
            Mm-hmm.

663
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,498
       Where is it -- oh.
         It's in there?

664
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,832
              Yes.
          You got it.

665
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,325
     Where the fuck is Dan?

666
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:42,759
What?

667
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,361
  I think he went over there.
       What's the matter?

668
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,565
          Here's your
         fucking phone.

669
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,201
             Uh...

670
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,602
           Hey, Mel?

671
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,071
              Mel?

672
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,372
              Mel.

673
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,074
     Mel, what's going on?

674
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,342
        Mel. What's up?

675
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,843
        Amanda, really?

676
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,478
          What are you
         talking about?

677
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,746
I can't --

678
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,082
     Mel, what's going on?

679
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,184
           Stop. Stop
      fucking pushing me.

680
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,319
         Fuck you. Agh!

681
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,488
        Don't touch me!

682
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,689
      Just don't touch me.

683
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,426
              Mel.

684
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,627
       Mel, why don't you
        just talk to me

685
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,129
          and tell me
        what's going on?

686
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,398
      What the fuck, Dan?
        You kissed her.

687
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,666
        You kissed her.

688
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,469
      <i> She</i> kissed<i> me,</i> okay?

689
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,337
       And I didn't think
       it was a big deal.

690
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,705
     I should've told you.
       It was a mistake,

691
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,140
         but I just --
        it was nothing.

692
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,375
           That's why
       I didn't tell you.

693
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:34,111
     I said don't touch me!

694
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,680
Why don't you just listen to me,
      okay? It was not --

695
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:37,881
             What?

696
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,349
         I didn't think
       it mattered, okay?

697
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,784
          It was just
       a stupid mistake.

698
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,252
   Then you would've told me!
      You would've told me

699
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,687
    this morning, but you're
        a fucking liar.

700
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:47,724
         Because<i> you</i> --
        you kissed her!

701
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,393
        You kissed her!

702
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,594
You kissed her!

703
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:51,862
             Fuck.

704
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,466
        Mel, I'm sorry.

705
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,801
       I fucked up, okay?

706
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,269
      I'm sorry, but I'll
    never do it again, okay?

707
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,537
       -Did you fuck her?
          -I love you.

708
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,706
      Answer the question.
       Did you fuck her?

709
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,174
       I didn't fuck her.

710
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,442
     Yeah, but you want to.

711
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,644
      -Stop it! All right?
         -You want to!

712
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,646
     Stop it! Fucking stop
     hitting me, all right?

713
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,381
         Ow! Fuck you!

714
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,285
          Get off me!

715
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,553
    Get away from the girl!

716
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,388
    Get away from the girl!
           Step away.

717
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,791
       Get on the ground!
       Get on the ground!

718
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,559
   You, over there! Put your
    hands behind your back.

719
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,261
 I just thought we were coming
    here to bust up a party.

720
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,563
          Do you have
      any weapons on you?

721
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,598
        -Do you have any
        weapons on you?!
              -No!

722
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,569
 -What are you doing here, huh?
   -I wasn't doing anything.

723
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,273
          Mel, please!

724
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,208
       You been drinkin'
            tonight?

725
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,211
            Get up!

726
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,913
      Mel, say something!

727
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:46,550
      Keep them separated.
         Keep her down!

728
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:47,818
           Sit down!

729
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,686
        What the fuck?!

730
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,356
       You have the right
       to remain silent.

731
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,691
        Anything you say
        can and will be

732
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,793
        used against you
       in a court of law.

733
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,464
           Wait! No!

734
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,731
          You can ask
        for an attorney.

735
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,200
      If you cannot afford
          an attorney,

736
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,801
      one will be provided
            for you.

737
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,203
 Do you understand these rights
   as I've read them to you?

738
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,404
           Yes. Yes.

739
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,872
             Wait.
      What are you doing?

740
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,273
    -No, this was a mistake.
  -Ma'am, please, take a seat.

741
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,541
         I'm sorry, no.
     We were just talking.

742
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:12,809
         This is a big
       misunderstanding.

743
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,277
         Keep her down!
           Sit down!

744
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,745
            Shut up
        and take a seat.

745
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,585
             Ahhhh.

746
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,559
        Can I help you?

747
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,795
     Uh, yeah, do you know
       when Daniel Mercer

748
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,996
     is gonna be released?

749
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,866
         Can you spell
     his last name for me?

750
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,801
          M-E-R-C-E-R.

751
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,749
     Well, we can hold him
   for up to about 24 hours,

752
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,619
  so I would suggest you maybe
      come back tomorrow.

753
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,261
           24 hours?

754
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,329
         24, at least.

755
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,934
             Okay.

756
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:13,436
        Okay, thank you.

757
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,808
      Take me home, okay?

758
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,411
             -Dan.
         -Don't do it.

759
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,055
              Dan.

760
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,890
             Dan --

761
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,481
             Sorry.

762
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,817
     I don't have anything
         to say to you.

763
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,471
          Talk to me.

764
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,978
I'm sorry.

765
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,718
           I'm sorry.

766
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,920
        Great job, Luke.
              Yes?

767
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,923
   How do you spell "winter?"

768
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,992
          Winter? W--

769
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,262
       Mel, are you okay?

770
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,231
           I'm sorry.
        I'm sorry, yeah.

771
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,000
    I just don't feel good.
     I'm sorry about that.

772
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,136
       Well, if you don't
  feel well, you can go home.

773
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,905
            Really?

774
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,141
       Yeah. I got this.
           Trust me.

775
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:13,243
             Okay.

776
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,111
      Yeah, maybe -- maybe
       it's for the best.

777
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,514
           I'm sorry.

778
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,249
    Don't worry. All right,
     I'll see you tomorrow.

779
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,817
           Thank you.

780
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,519
     All right, everybody.

781
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,788
     Take two more minutes
      to finish your work.

782
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,523
Yes, ma'am!

783
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:27,857
          Yes, ma'am.

784
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,559
          Yes, ma'am.

785
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,927
          Yes, ma'am.

786
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,201
              Dan!

787
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,836
           Thank you.
         Saved us. Wow.

788
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,172
   We got a question for ya.
       Please, sit down.

789
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:44,974
             Okay.

790
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,678
             So...

791
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,648
          Question...

792
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,918
    What do you like better,
        the Early Oughts

793
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,986
       or the Wild Bucks?

794
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,188
        The Wild Bucks.

795
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,256
              Bam.
           Thank you.

796
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,658
     Would you like a job?

797
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,260
             What?

798
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,663
           Seriously.
     Would you like a job?

799
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,331
      You heard us talking
     about how we're gonna

800
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,200
       set up that office
          in Brooklyn.

801
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,868
        Jason's gonna go
     out there and run it.

802
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,136
        I'm gonna be out
     every once in a while,

803
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,638
      but we need somebody
      on the ground there

804
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,209
         to do the shit
          he can't do.

805
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:24,113
      Um, thank you, guys.
        This is amazing.

806
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,882
   I don't know what to say.

807
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,951
             Sure.
    It's like an assistant.

808
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:29,853
     You help set up shop,
    get the office running,

809
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:31,688
      you'll go see shows.

810
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,825
  'Cause I have a newborn and
  I'll be moving into a house.

811
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,696
       So I'll be living
    vicariously through you.

812
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,831
             Cool.
     Well, think about it.

813
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,801
I would feel much better if you
 were going out there with me.

814
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,069
         But I'll talk
        to y'all later.

815
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,837
             Okay.

816
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,709
             Look,

817
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:55,144
     I love the initiative
   you're taking here at Topo

818
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,746
       and we wouldn't be
     offering you this job

819
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,014
       if we didn't think

820
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,383
      that you were really
      part of the family.

821
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,851
         You know, like
     take a couple of days

822
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,152
      and think about it,
          that's fine.

823
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,387
          I understand
     you have a life here,

824
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,322
    you've got a girlfriend.

825
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,124
   You make choices in life.
           You know,

826
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,993
       you win something,
      you lose something.

827
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,028
     Man, I can't -- can't
       thank you enough.

828
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,930
      Absolutely, brother.
         You earned it.

829
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,065
             Cool.

830
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,267
        Get the fuck out
          of my chair.

831
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:18,668
             Okay.

832
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,637
              Hey.

833
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,938
           Congrats.

834
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,206
          Thanks, man.

835
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,044
    Yeah, no, they shouldn't
        know the words.

836
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,147
      They can't possibly.

837
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:32,782
           You knew?

838
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:33,983
       You fucking knew.

839
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,184
           Fuck you.

840
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,719
          Why the fuck
      didn't you tell me?

841
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,021
    They made me promise not
     to tell you. It was --

842
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:39,322
    -"They made me promise."
       -It was very hard.

843
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,024
     It was very difficult
    for me not to tell you.

844
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:43,026
      Well, what the fuck?

845
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,061
         Put 'er there.

846
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,362
              Yes!

847
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:48,798
      I'm sorry. I'm very
       happy and excited.

848
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,366
       I'm happy for you.

849
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,834
    You want to get a drink
      later to celebrate?

850
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,036
            Mm-hmm.

851
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,237
              Yes.

852
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,438
        Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

853
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,177
        But, guys, like
      what if he's there?

854
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,812
    He's not gonna be there.

855
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,380
     I'd be surprised if he
    even knew these people.

856
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,916
       Someone invited me
          from class.

857
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,785
   Okay, you have some really
      cute things in here.

858
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:10,386
       Guys, why isn't he
    texting me back already?

859
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,156
            This is
       so fucking stupid.

860
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,757
       Oh, my gosh, Mel.

861
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:15,959
       Come on, come out
        with us tonight.

862
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:19,062
          It'll be fun
    to just forget about Dan

863
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:20,463
       and just let loose
         a little bit.

864
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,231
              No.

865
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,933
          It's stupid
       for me to go out.

866
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,702
           All right.

867
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:27,704
       Well, we are gonna
     get out of here, then.

868
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:28,905
           All right.
           Have fun.

869
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:30,106
           Bye, girl.

870
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,341
            Call us
       if you wanna come.

871
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:33,009
              Bye.

872
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,341
         <i> Hey, it's Dan.</i>
      <i> You know what to do.</i>

873
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,911
       Hey, uh, it's Mel.

874
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:11,848
             Um...

875
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,750
            I, uh --

876
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:17,153
          I miss you.

877
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,988
         Call me back.

878
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,124
              Bye.

879
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,268
              So.

880
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,970
       Um, I just wanted
          to apologize

881
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,505
        about that text
   I sent you the other day.

882
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:36,906
       I was really drunk

883
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:38,107
           and I know
     you have a girlfriend

884
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,877
    and I do not want to be
          that person.

885
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,480
         Even -- um...

886
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:48,017
      Yeah, Mel and I are
    actually on kind of a...

887
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,053
        break right now.

888
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:53,523
         Well, tonight,
       we are celebrating

889
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,425
         you leaving us
         for Brooklyn,

890
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:56,926
         so let's drown
       your sorrows, huh?

891
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,127
         Sounds great.

892
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,099
             Ahem.

893
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,467
              Ah.

894
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,936
         I don't know,
       it's just kind of

895
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,806
     frustrating right now,
           'cause...

896
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:11,808
        I just felt like
         this should be

897
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,342
   just a purely happy moment

898
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:15,244
         and, instead,
         it's just like

899
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:18,514
      "Now, what the fuck
           do I do?"

900
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,149
             Uh...
      You go to Brooklyn.

901
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,884
             Yeah,
      that's what you do.

902
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,086
             Yeah.

903
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,587
       Yeah, you're going
          to Brooklyn.

904
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,290
     You'd be crazy not to.

905
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:30,927
          I guess so.

906
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,595
         I don't know.

907
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:36,232
    I totally, totally know
   what you're going through.

908
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,468
       My boyfriend and I
  broke up after we graduated,

909
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,138
         but it took us
     about a year, I think,

910
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,208
       to realize that's
    what we were doing and,

911
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,443
     yeah, it just sucked.

912
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:51,481
     Finally, after a long
       while, I realized

913
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:55,351
    we were going in totally
     different directions.

914
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:58,187
          But, I mean,
        maybe that's not

915
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,556
      what's gonna happen
            to you.

916
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,070
         Hey-ey-ey-ey.

917
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,938
              Aah!
         What the fuck?

918
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,140
           You came!

919
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,574
    I'm so glad you're here.

920
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:20,276
           Hey, hey,
     meet our new friends.

921
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,477
         This is Will.

922
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,045
              Hey.

923
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,248
              Mel.
      And this is Austin.

924
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,185
     You came just in time.
   We are just taking shots.

925
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:33,356
      There you go, baby.

926
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:35,525
       Wait, wait, wait,
      wait wait wait wait!

927
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:37,093
        -Let's cheers...
            -To me.

928
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:39,529
            To Mel,

929
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:43,065
because we all know you've been
  going through a rough time.

930
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,401
      -But you know what?
             -What?

931
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:49,071
   Fuck Dan, because you are
    so much better than Dan.

932
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:51,007
      Who the fuck's Dan?

933
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,608
      Who the fuck cares?

934
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,477
           -Fuck 'im.
             -Yay.

935
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,973
          I want to do
         that one next.

936
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:25,174
              Dan.

937
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,609
            Journey?

938
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:28,444
      Journey? Absolutely.

939
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:31,113
        Hey, guys, guys,
      pay attention to us.

940
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:32,481
         We are the --

941
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:33,983
            Make me.

942
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,385
      Sing away. When you
       give us something

943
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,020
      to pay attention to,
      we'll pay attention.

944
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:43,459
   All right, so we're gonna
    sing a song about love.

945
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,707
         Oh, you good?
             More?

946
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,081
           Ugh. Mnh.

947
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,549
           Ohh! Fu--

948
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,050
             Sorry.

949
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:12,088
- Ugh!

950
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,424
          I just want
       to party forever.

951
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:16,626
          Okay, okay.

952
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:19,562
          Well, let's
      take you home, okay?

953
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,564
        We're just gonna
   take you home, all right?

954
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,099
         It'll be fun.

955
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,767
       I'm gonna go back
    to the party after this.

956
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,235
       Hold on, you know,
         let me just --

957
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,104
       I have to go pee.
         Just don't --

958
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,605
     Ew, that's disgusting.

959
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,007
     Why does he gotta pee?

960
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,309
    I cannot believe you --

961
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:34,644
        Oh, wait, wait!

962
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:36,545
           Aah! Aah!

963
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,247
      Can I have a little
        privacy, please?

964
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,448
         What the fuck?

965
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,651
          We're tryin'
         to walk, here!

966
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:43,719
          You're gonna
        take us all out.

967
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,121
      You're gonna take us
     all out. Okay, steady.

968
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:47,390
    Okay, we're going there.
            C'mere.

969
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:49,025
              Ooh!

970
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,761
         Okay, c'mere.

971
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,229
     Do you want your shoes
           on or off?

972
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,164
         Well, I guess
      I'll take them off.

973
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:58,434
         Take them off.

974
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:05,141
   Okay, your shoes are off.
     You're at home, okay?

975
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,442
       I'll tuck you in.

976
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,478
        I love you, too.
      We're gonna go back.

977
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,547
   Don't vomit in your sleep
         and die, okay?

978
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,785
    Okay, I'm gonna go back
      to the party, okay?

979
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:18,554
       Are you gonna come
   back to the party with me?

980
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,523
             Oh...

981
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:22,358
         Mmm, is it...?

982
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,160
   Do you think I could like
  crash here? Would that be --

983
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:25,695
    Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

984
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:27,797
       You can just sleep
         on the couch,

985
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,333
         or something,
     but I'm gonna go back.

986
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:31,701
          Okay, cool.
           All right.

987
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:34,403
     Will you just grab her
       a glass of water,

988
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,205
         or something,
     before you go to bed?

989
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,207
        Uh, yeah, sure.

990
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:40,176
            -Thanks.
       -Yeah, no worries.

991
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:41,811
          -Goodnight.
          -Goodnight!

992
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,349
             Whoo!

993
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,785
         That's right.
         Fuckin' rocks!

994
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:24,520
             Yeah!

995
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,721
            Come on.

996
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:27,690
        Come on, Amanda.

997
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,362
          Knock-knock.

998
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,608
              Dan?

999
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,444
        Doctor's orders.
      You want some water?

1000
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,313
            Mnh, no.

1001
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,816
  You should drink something.
            Come on.

1002
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,152
You will -- you will -- you will
    thank me in the morning,

1003
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:58,220
        if you just have
          some, yeah.

1004
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,860
         One more sip.

1005
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,595
     You should, seriously.

1006
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:07,797
    You -- you will thank me
        in the morning.

1007
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,398
        Drink some more.

1008
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,236
              Mnh!

1009
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,672
          That's good.
          Just take --

1010
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,240
          Stop. Stop.

1011
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,360
              Hey.

1012
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:40,563
             Yeah?

1013
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,431
       Will you lie down
            with me?

1014
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,367
       Lie down with me,
            please.

1015
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,636
             Yeah.

1016
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,271
           Move over.

1017
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,254
           Yes, pull.

1018
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:07,356
       It's so straight.

1019
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,924
      It's not as straight
           as yours.

1020
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:10,426
        Why is your hair
          so straight?

1021
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,728
         -I don't know.
     -Do you straighten it?

1022
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,929
              -No.
              -No?

1023
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,831
no.

1024
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,633
             Okay.

1025
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:22,972
              Hey.

1026
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,253
    This one's for you, Dan.

1027
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:40,890
         Oh, yes. Whoo!

1028
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,747
          I don't know
       this song at all.

1029
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,348
            I don't.

1030
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,053
             Ahem.

1031
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,555
         Dan, the man.

1032
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:29,638
          There we go.
          There we go.

1033
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,940
             Yeah!

1034
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:32,875
          Whoo! Whoo!

1035
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,780
              Huh.

1036
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,802
Hey, it's me.

1037
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,741
             Stop.
      What are you doing?

1038
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:39,942
      What do you think --

1039
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,143
       Stop! Sto-- stop!

1040
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,412
            Hey. Ow!

1041
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:44,680
         What the fuck?
          Get off me!

1042
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:47,016
             Fuck!

1043
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:52,488
      You -- get the fuck
        out of here! Go!

1044
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,123
    I'm going. It's not that
     fucking big of a deal.

1045
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,659
            Please,
     just calm down, okay?

1046
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:18,047
          Yeah, I was
      about two years old.

1047
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:24,853
     Wow. Very nice, guys.
           Very nice.

1048
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:29,425
      I'll be right back.

1049
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:32,027
    Mel, I can't understand
    anything you're saying.

1050
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,007
           I don't --

1051
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,652
      What the fuck, Mel?

1052
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:59,054
      You call me, you say
      you're at my house,

1053
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:00,456
       and you're crying
         and I have to

1054
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,724
         fuckin' leave
       and come get you,

1055
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:04,960
    and, now, you don't want
         to talk to me?

1056
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:08,030
Can you...?

1057
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,231
           All right.

1058
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:11,033
      He was on top of me.

1059
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,601
       I pushed him off,
       I pushed him off,

1060
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,503
    'cause I didn't want to
           and he --

1061
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:17,706
           Oh, shit.

1062
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,074
         What happened?

1063
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:20,509
          What are you
         talking about?

1064
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:21,710
       Dan, I didn't even
        want to go out.

1065
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,112
    I didn't want to go out,
          but Becca --

1066
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:24,580
          What are you
         talking about?

1067
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:27,049
    He was just everywhere.

1068
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,250
       I pushed him off.

1069
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:29,651
              Oh!

1070
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:30,853
         Are you okay?

1071
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,755
   Yeah, I just -- I'm fine.

1072
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:34,590
         What the fuck?
        Who is this guy?

1073
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:36,158
    I'm fine. I don't know.
      He's gone, he left.

1074
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,559
     What did he do to you?

1075
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,128
          Oh, my God.
        I can't take it.

1076
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,596
     What did he do to you?

1077
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:41,897
     Nothing. He didn't --
          I pushed --

1078
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,532
     Can you just hold me,
            please?

1079
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,100
     You don't understand.
  I just need you to hold me.

1080
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,902
           I -- ahhh.

1081
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,243
             Ohhh.

1082
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,283
           You okay?

1083
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:04,019
           Oh, shit.

1084
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,854
           I'm sorry.

1085
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:07,790
        I shouldn't have
        come over here.

1086
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,057
      You don't even want
           to see me.

1087
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,559
     I shouldn't have come
           over here.

1088
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:12,795
      No, that's not true.
        That's not true.

1089
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,229
             Sorry.

1090
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:16,298
        Don't be sorry.
     Don't apologize to me.

1091
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,802
-Please, don't apologize to me.
     -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1092
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:23,639
     I was just so scared.

1093
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,110
             <i> Hello?</i>

1094
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,279
      <i> Hey, Mom, it's Dan.</i>

1095
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,948
    <i> Just calling to let you</i>
      <i> know that Mel and I</i>

00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:09,918
       <i> to help Mel's mom</i>
       <i> pack up the house.</i>

1098
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,353
        <i> I just got back</i>
        <i> from next door.</i>

1099
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:13,655
     <i> It's chaos over there,</i>
             <i> but --</i>

1100
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,724
          <i> Oh, really?</i>

1101
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,059
  <i> Yes. I mean, but it's okay.</i>
       <i> Do you want to do</i>

1102
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:18,594
    <i> a dinner Saturday night,</i>
        <i> the four of us?</i>

1103
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:19,862
           <i> Oh, yeah,</i>
       <i> that sounds good.</i>

1104
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:21,663
             <i> Okay.</i>
     <i> I'll get it together.</i>

1105
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:22,998
    <i> All right, I'll call you</i>
    <i> when we're heading down</i>

1106
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,600
        <i> and I'll see you</i>
         <i> this weekend.</i>

1107
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:26,702
      <i> Great, I can't wait.</i>

1108
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:27,970
          <i> I love you.</i>
      <i> Give my love to Mel.</i>

1109
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,705
         <i> Love you, too.</i>
         <i> Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

1110
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:30,973
         <i> Bye, sweetie.</i>

1111
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,276
      You want some help?

1112
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:35,677
              No.

1113
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,613
            Oh, God.

1114
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:40,916
   I can't believe your mom's
   moving out of this house.

1115
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:42,184
       Where's the tape?

1116
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:44,019
         I don't know.
      Will you come here?

1117
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,354
            C'mere.

1118
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,256
           You okay?

1119
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:48,690
         I don't know.

1120
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,025
            I think
      you're done packing.

1121
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,362
          It's the end
        of my childhood.

1122
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,397
     I have to grow up now?

1123
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:56,865
       Yeah, I guess so.

1124
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,367
         I guess that's
       what's happening.

1125
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,337
     But it's not that bad,
             right?

1126
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,974
          It's kind of
         a cool thing.

1127
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,643
   Everything fits in boxes.

1128
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,778
      How can you pack up
      your life in boxes?

1129
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,313
    I don't know, but you've
       done a great job.

1130
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,315
            -Thanks.
     -You really did great.

1131
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:15,817
             -Hey.
             -Hey.

1132
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:17,719
           What's up?

1133
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,154
        Do you remember
        our first time?

1134
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:20,722
            Mm-hmm.

1135
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,658
      And do you remember
     that my mom came home?

1136
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:26,728
    I'm pretty sure she was
    there during some of it.

1137
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,930
              No!

1138
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:29,164
          -I think so.
              -No!

1139
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,866
          'Cause when
      we came downstairs,

1140
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:32,701
       her face was like

1141
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:35,704
            "How...
       How is everything?

1142
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:36,905
      Is everything okay?"

1143
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,106
        Dan, I couldn't
          look at her.

1144
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:39,308
        Oh, I remember.

1145
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,076
     Oh! I get embarrassed,

1146
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,678
   just thinking about that.

1147
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,179
      Oh! You just totally
         ran out on me.

1148
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,781
           I'm sorry.

1149
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,216
   I was like "what the fuck?
       Where did she go?"

1150
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:53,188
    Then, we got ice cream.

1151
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,690
         You bought me
         an ice cream.

1152
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,258
        Yeah. Gentleman.

1153
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,393
            Classy.

1154
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,242
              Hey.

1155
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,711
              Hi.

1156
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,713
        How's it going?

1157
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:19,281
             Good.
       How's the packing?

1158
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,983
            Oh, it's
       a little intense.

1159
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:22,250
        Mel and her mom,
         they're upset.

1160
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,853
           -It's hot.
             -Yeah.

1161
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,221
      Well, you can always
      take a swim, after.

1162
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:27,789
            Mm-hmm.

1163
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,992
     I just want to get it
       through, you know?

1164
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:31,259
       Get it done with.

1165
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,928
      What are you doing?

1166
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,231
      Oh, emails, nothing.

1167
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,799
            Mm-hmm?

1168
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:41,737
       I have some news.

1169
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,406
    Um, so, the record label
        offered me a job

1170
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:45,874
          in New York.

1171
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,075
              Wow.

1172
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,410
        Yeah. It's cool.

1173
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:50,178
             Yeah.

1174
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,514
    But I don't know whether
   or not to do it, you know?

1175
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:55,784
    Like we -- Mel and I --
         we had a plan.

1176
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:57,119
       I just don't know
          what to do.

1177
01:00:57,121 --> 01:01:01,089
    Okay, do you -- you want
        my real answer?

1178
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,290
             Yeah.

1179
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,092
     'Cause my real answer
            is that

1180
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:08,864
     you need to make this
      decision about you,

1181
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:11,266
        not Mel and not
       this relationship.

1182
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,201
         Honey, I know

1183
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:16,271
       how special it is
       with you and Mel.

1184
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:18,006
         You're family
         to each other

1185
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,108
        and we all are,
       we're all family.

1186
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,877
        And I love her.

1187
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,111
        This is nothing
          against Mel.

1188
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:27,516
      But I am telling you
            this is

1189
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:31,286
      a great opportunity
    and I know you want it.

1190
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:32,988
         I know you do.

1191
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,290
         And, honestly,
      if I could tell you

1192
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:36,792
            anything
      that was valuable --

1193
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,794
     And I'm talking to you
      as an adult, now --

1194
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:42,330
           That if --
      if I could go back,

1195
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:43,965
      have it over again,
        there are things

1196
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,467
     I would change, there
      are things that I --

1197
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,002
           Like what?

1198
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:49,538
       Well, I don't know
 and I'm -- this isn't about me

1199
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,307
    or regrets, or anything,
      it's just I'm trying

1200
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,910
       to share with you
    that we make decisions,

1201
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,012
      they affect the rest
         of our lives.

1202
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:58,847
    I would have maybe gone
         to grad school

1203
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:01,450
    and had a career I love
         and, you know.

1204
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:04,453
        Please, you know
        what I'm saying.

1205
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:06,154
          I know what
         you're saying.

1206
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,856
          It's kind of
           stressful.

1207
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,025
     Well, I don't want you
        to have regrets.

1208
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:11,960
           Me either.

1209
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,962
       Yeah, that's what
       I'm talking about.

1210
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,098
     This life goes around
           one time.

1211
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,365
--That's it.

1212
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:19,835
         -No pressure.
       -Well, it's true.

1213
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,103
     I know, you're right.

1214
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:23,438
             Fuck.

1215
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,208
           You know,
     we want this for you,

1216
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,909
     if it's what you want.

1217
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,551
           So, um...

1218
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:11,620
           I have to
      tell you something.

1219
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,393
        The record label
       offered me a job.

1220
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:20,462
             What?!

1221
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,464
             What?!

1222
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,332
          Oh, my God.

1223
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:25,534
        That's amazing.

1224
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,068
         Yeah, I know.

1225
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,270
       I'm superexcited.

1226
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:29,671
       But it's gonna be
          in New York

1227
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:33,108
    and I'm gonna like help
     open the office there

1228
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,509
     as Jason's assistant,
           basically.

1229
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:36,444
             What?

1230
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:37,679
          In New York?

1231
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,381
             Yeah.

1232
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,249
     I mean, it's gonna be
       like totally fine.

1233
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,084
     It's just for a year,
           you know?

1234
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:44,619
     We'll do long-distance
        and we'll visit

1235
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:46,087
          each other,
     like my freshman year.

1236
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,455
          But that was
     completely different.

1237
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:48,924
  It worked out fine, though,
        and you can come

1238
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:50,192
          to New York
       when you graduate.

1239
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:52,160
          No, you were
        two hours away,

1240
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,562
      not half the country
             away.

1241
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:56,064
    That's okay. We've been
     together for so long,

1242
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,365
       we could do that.
         It's nothing.

1243
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,100
       Just listen, okay?
    I've thought about this.

1244
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,335
      Well, what about us?

1245
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,603
     I've thought about it
             and --

1246
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,104
             Yeah?

1247
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,173
       We can totally do
    this long-distance thing

1248
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,441
          for a year.

1249
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:08,143
        W-Well, well --

1250
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:11,479
      Why are you reacting
           this way?

1251
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,714
     Did you take the job?

1252
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:14,182
         No, I haven't
         taken it, yet,

1253
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,218
       but I'm going to,
           obviously.

1254
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,686
             I ca--

1255
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,487
        I can't believe
       you're doing this.

1256
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,056
        What am I doing?

1257
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:22,490
       What do you mean?
        You're leaving!

1258
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,259
   You're going to New York.
     You can't just<i> decide</i>

1259
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:25,627
         to do things.

1260
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:27,262
     Why can't you just be
      happy for me, okay?

1261
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:29,731
       This is a job that
    I've wanted for<i> so</i> long.

1262
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,633
    -No, the job you wanted
      was here in Austin.
     -I just want you to be
         happy for me.

1263
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,335
          This is what
        we planned for.

1264
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:34,603
     It's not as if things

1265
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:36,304
         always happen
       according to plan.

1266
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:37,706
    Well, it's not like<i> you</i>
   can just make the changes.

1267
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,174
   Can't you be a little bit
       flexible, please?

1268
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:40,442
        Well, can't you
        decide something

1269
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:41,710
        that's not just
         for yourself?

1270
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,178
      Why can't you think
           about me?

1271
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,579
     All you think about is
            yourself

1272
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:46,114
       and all the things
           you want.

1273
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:48,183
    You're saying I'm being
        selfish and like

1274
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:49,451
     I try and talk to you
           about this

1275
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:50,719
     and you just flip out!

1276
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:52,621
         You've already
        made a decision.

1277
01:04:52,623 --> 01:04:55,290
You flip out at any conversation
  of me not being with you --

1278
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,558
    It's not a conversation!

1279
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,026
         You flip out.
   I can't believe you're --

1280
01:04:58,028 --> 01:04:59,327
   You didn't want to see me
         for two weeks.

1281
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,029
   You just kicked me aside.
        You ignored me!

1282
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:03,398
   I did not kick you aside.
       I asked for space!

1283
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,066
    And you couldn't respect
    that, in the slightest.

1284
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,501
        You flipped out.

1285
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,570
   It's like you need me and,
      if I'm not with you

1286
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:11,273
         all the time,
    you're gonna fall apart.

1287
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:12,707
       It is exhausting,

1288
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:14,242
       being with someone
    who is so<i> fucking</i> needy.

1289
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,510
       I don't need you!

1290
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:18,446
   I don't fucking need you,
          so get out.

1291
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:20,415
Okay.

1292
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,083
      Dan, I'm s-- I'm --

1293
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,618
please, Dan,
        leave right now.

1294
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,487
You don't
       want me to leave.

1295
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:27,722
   I want you to get the fuck
   out of my house right now!

1296
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:30,358
            I can't.

1297
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,726
        Dan, go, please!

1298
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:34,329
        All right, fine.

1299
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:35,764
        Fuckin' asshole.

1300
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:37,532
           Fuck you!

1301
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:40,168
      Fucking little kid.
             Jesus.

1302
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,306
             Shit!

1303
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,508
             Shit!

1304
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,686
   Why do I keep doing this?

1305
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:33,088
           Hey, Mel?

1306
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,322
           Oh, fuck!

1307
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,591
      He's not picking up.
      He's not picking up.

1308
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:39,194
            -C'mere.
             -God!

1309
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:40,462
   I have to -- I have to --
   I have to go talk to him.

1310
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:41,830
      No. Mel, that is not
          a good idea.

1311
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:43,465
     I need to talk to him
      and explain things.

1312
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,467
      God, he can be such
    a fucking asshole, too.

1313
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:46,768
     Well, just sleep on it

1314
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,770
       and go talk to him
           tomorrow.

1315
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,238
        Give him a day.

1316
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,340
           Oh, shit.

1317
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,676
       I fucked this up.

1318
01:06:57,714 --> 01:06:59,180
             Shit.

1319
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,368
          Hey, Amanda.

1320
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,674
             Here?

1321
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,710
            Mm-hmm.

1322
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:37,318
          -Cool flag.
            -Thanks.

1323
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,501
      You play that thing?

1324
01:07:53,503 --> 01:07:55,303
           Sometimes.

1325
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,338
         You any good?

1326
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:01,709
         I don't know.
            Kind of.

1327
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,588
     Can I play something?

1328
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,691
             Yeah.

1329
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,726
     Oh, my God, I fucking
       love this record.

1330
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:21,529
        So fucking good.

1331
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:11,873
              Unh!

1332
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,322
              Hey.

1333
01:10:28,692 --> 01:10:29,958
              Hi.

1334
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,732
         I have to go.

1335
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,536
        -See you later?
            -Mm-hmm.

1336
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:38,026
         I'm gonna go.

1337
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:39,427
            Come on.

1338
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,453
You fucking asshole!

1339
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:06,954
          -Stop! Stop!
         -What the fuck
      is wrong with you?!

1340
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,990
     How could you fucking
         do this to me?

1341
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:10,625
          I hate you!

1342
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:11,826
              Aah!

1343
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:15,663
          You fucking
         piece of shit!

1344
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,432
          I came here
         to apologize.

1345
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:19,534
    How fucking stupid am I?

1346
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:20,802
  To come here and apologize,
        see if we could

1347
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:22,904
          work it out
      in fucking New York.

1348
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:26,207
             Shit!

1349
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:27,675
          You fucking
         piece of shit!

1350
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,010
            Stop it!

1351
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:31,112
     Aah! You gonna hit me?

1352
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:33,047
              Aah!

1353
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,615
             You --

1354
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:35,817
              Ah!

1355
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:43,024
             Fuck!

1356
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,825
              Hi.

1357
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,700
        How you feeling?

1358
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:03,638
      I'm okay. I'm fine.

1359
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,607
       I've been better.

1360
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,780
             Yeah.

1361
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,855
      I'm so embarrassed.

1362
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:27,728
            Me too.

1363
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,964
      Will you come closer
         to me, please?

1364
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,993
       I'm really sorry.

1365
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:07,935
      I love you so much.

1366
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:13,274
     And I've been thinking
       about this and...

1367
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,243
       I don't want to go
      to New York anymore.

1368
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:17,712
          I don't want
      to change our plans.

1369
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:19,614
   I want to make this work.

1370
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:21,382
       So I'm not going.

1371
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,856
            I think
      you should take it.

1372
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:32,927
        No. What are you
         talking about?

1373
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,133
    Dan, I love you so much.

1374
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,401
        I love you, too.

1375
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:41,869
   But it doesn't feel right.

1376
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,237
      I can't not see you
           every day.

1377
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,939
    I can't not be with you.

1378
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:49,310
     Please don't do this.

1379
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:53,314
   I don't want to break up.

1380
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:57,218
      Tell me you love me
          and you want

1381
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:01,989
       to spend the rest
     of your life with me.

1382
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:05,860
       Look me in the eye
          and tell me.

1383
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:25,880
           I'm sorry.

1384
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:30,251
             Fuck!
