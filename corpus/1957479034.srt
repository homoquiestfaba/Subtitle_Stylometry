00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,886
Nothing like a good death chat
first thing in the morning.

180
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,971
-[Andre] Okay.
-[Cory giggles]

181
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,974
-[laughs] Is that funny?
-Right? It's ridiculous. Come on.

182
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,060
Look, if Mom could be sitting here
right now with us,

183
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:27,232
and, like, you know, we couldn't tell,
she was indistinguishable, then yeah.

184
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,069
You know, screw the ethics.
I would take that.

185
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,573
I mean-- I mean, that being said,

186
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,701
if they happen to delete
her fondness for yacht rock,

187
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,620
-I would not be devastated.
-[Andre] Yes.

188
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,164
Going crazy.
Gimme the lips, Poppy. Gimme the lips.

189
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,874
There it is.

190
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,459
[laughs] Yes.

191
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,543
[slams table]

192
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,590
[sighs]

193
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:14,112
[Dr. Scott] I know how you're feeling,
but there is no lie.

194
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,740
When the memory of this process
gets wiped,

195
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:21,495
he wakes up that day at home
as Cameron Turner.

196
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,831
And no one knows. Not even him.

197
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,877
It's the only way this works.
A clean swap.

198
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,632
How many others are out there?
I wanna know.

199
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,178
You'll be our third.

200
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,143
This will be as common
as a heart transplant within a few years.

201
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:51,900
Come back and spend a week with him
before making your decision.

202
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,906
This is not just my decision.
My wife needs to know.

203
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,412
Either you decide that your wife would
want this, which requires secrecy,

204
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:07,666
or you decide that she wouldn't,
and tell her you're dying.

205
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:13,463
Either way, you're deciding for her.

206
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:23,348
{\an8}Listen, the woman you're about to meet
has no idea she's a duplicate.

207
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,061
<i>Neither does her daughter,
her mother, or her friends.</i>

208
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,565
{\an8}<i>So, where is the lie?</i>

209
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,369
[door closes]

210
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:51,460
Oh, hey, there. Mr. Turner, right?

211
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,712
Yeah, uh, Cameron.

212
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,506
Browsing for a three-bed
in the neighborhood?

213
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,840
Oh, yeah.

214
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,091
[video game beeping]

215
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,721
This is, uh, my boss, Samantha.

216
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,973
I'm her daughter.

217
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,017
-Mm-hmm, daughter.
-[chuckles]

218
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,101
She runs a tight ship.

219
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,938
Anyway, have a seat.

220
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,524
I had some good ones
come in today, actually.

221
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,070
You said in your message
you had a son, right?

222
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,322
Yeah. Cory.

223
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,157
He runs the show as well?

224
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,868
Yeah. The smaller, the bossier.

225
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,203
[chuckles]

226
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,843
[no audible dialogue]

[Poppy continues vocalizing]

230
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,996
-Hey.
-Hey.

231
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,670
[music plays]

232
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,339
[Poppy vocalizing on speakers]

233
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,678
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

234
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,138
[laughs]

235
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,224
Cory at Jessie's for dinner?

236
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,060
Yeah. He's back at 8:00.

237
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,562
Mmm.

238
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,230
-You taking a break?
-Yeah.

239
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:38,483
[music continues]

240
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,242
-[beep, music ends]
-Mmm.

241
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,173
So I think we're gonna get Dr. Herbert
for the ultrasound.

242
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,257
Mmm.

243
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:05,552
I'm just waiting for them to confirm,
but it's looking good.

244
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:06,720
Yeah.

245
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,804
Mm-hmm.

246
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,015
[sighs] That's good. We like Herbert.

247
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,522
Are you bracing yourself
for sexy bowling ball bod?

248
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,023
[both chuckle]

249
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,532
I still can't believe it.

250
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,952
We're gonna fall in love
with a new little person again.

251
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,496
Seven months.

252
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,831
[sighs]

253
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,421
-[breathes shakily]
-What's up, Cam?

254
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:45,759
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

255
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,389
I'm good. It's just, um…

256
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,522
It's just, um…

257
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,569
[inhales sharply]

258
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,654
So, we, um…

259
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:08,991
Cameron?

260
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:12,828
Um…

261
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,377
It's just, a new little person. And, um…

262
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,214
I think that's just sinking in still,
you know.

263
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:25,382
[breathing shakily]

264
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,218
[chuckles] Oh, bear.

265
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:31,763
Cam.

266
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,767
Cam.

267
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,729
I know it took me a minute,

268
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,733
and I know we haven't been us for a while,

269
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,111
but this baby is going to be good for us.

270
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,030
Yeah.

271
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,077
We're gonna be okay. All right?

272
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,162
Mm-hmm.

273
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,009
[Poppy] Cory.

274
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,012
[line ringing]

275
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,722
[Cory speaks indistinctly]

00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,894
[ringing continues]

277
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,147
[Dr. Scott] <i>Cameron?</i>

278
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,358
[Cameron] I've changed my mind.

279
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,928
M-Mind if I sit?

00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,731
Hi. I'm-- I'm Cameron.

282
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:06,900
Kate.

283
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,447
So, you met her?

284
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:14,992
Yesterday.

285
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:18,453
How's she doing?

286
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,790
Good. I guess.

287
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,667
She try to sell you a house?

288
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,711
Mmm. Condo.

289
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:28,839
It's what we do.

290
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:31,425
Mmm.

00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,555
[Poppy] <i>A week?</i>

292

today, zero notice?</i>

293
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,978
<i>What's going on, Cam?</i>

294
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,563
Nothing.

295

The designer they had got sick last minute
and they needed someone here in person.

296
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:51,862
Look, I'm sorry, P. I am.

297
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:55,073
I wish I didn't have to be away right now.
Believe me.

298
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,284
[television playing]

299
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,204
<i>All right. Well, I'd better get back here.</i>

300
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,873
-<i>I'll speak to you later, yeah?</i>
-All right.

[sighs]

302
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,057
[Dalton] Okay, Cameron.

303
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,853
You'll be out for the entire process.
It'll take about six hours.

304
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,314
[Cameron] Okay. He'll have everything?

305
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,191
[Dr. Scott] Every single memory

306
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,194
right up to the moment
you lose consciousness in that chair.

307
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,416
[Dalton] In a few moments,
you're gonna go under.

308
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,838
Okay. I-I think I--

309
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,925
I thi-- [sighs]

[video camera rolling]

312
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,852
Like, you having a moment.
You having a day.

[overlapping chatter]

314
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,608
[chattering stops]

315

[footsteps approaching]

316
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,626
Thank you.

317
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:38,927
So, he has everything?

318
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:42,389
Mm-hmm. Even the memories
you've stored deep in your subconscious.

319
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,856
[Cameron] All those memories,
they're not just mine.

320
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,275
They're my-- my wife's, my son's.

321
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,819
Not part of some experiment.

322
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,155
I just wish I could talk to her.

323
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,283
When they sent "me 2.0" back,

324
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,162
seeing my mom look into her eyes
not knowing it wasn't me,

325
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,623
seeing her talking to my daughter…

326
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:09,583
I mean…

327
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,338
And then when they wiped her…

328
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:20,469
knowing she was no longer in on the lie,
my guilt faded pretty quick.

329
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,683
We share an oncologist, you know?

330
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,144
Dr. Kerosima?

331
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:30,979
Yep.

332
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:36,235
The patient before me
was a patient of hers too.

333
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:45,911
She seemed happy, your daughter.
They both did.

334
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,210
Yeah?

335
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,135
How long has she been out there?

336
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,807
Roughly…

337
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,601
forty-two days, six hours.

338
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,312
Roughly?

339
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,023
Ballpark.

340
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,442
[Cameron laughs]

341
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,867
[Dr. Scott] Memory cross-checks
allow us to make sure

342
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,119
that his conscious
and subconscious memories

343
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,538
are perfectly in sync with yours.

344
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,833
It will feel strange at first.

345
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,003
Just try to stay in each memory.

346
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,218
In your own time, Cameron.

347
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,392
{\an8}-[overlapping chattering]
-[Cameron's parent] Cameron.

348
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:52,686
[Cameron] Hi.

349
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,063
Cameron, I like your picture.

350
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,442
-[Dr. Scott] Breathe.
-[breathes deeply]

351
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:03,864
It feels real because as far as
your brain is concerned, it is real.

352
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,367
Just, uh, skipped way back.

353
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,785
That's normal.

354
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:12,623
As it progresses,
the system will test any point in time

355
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,124
all the way back to birth.

356
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,754
[Dalton] It's vital that you do your best
to stay in the memories

357
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,548
and not break the flow, okay?

358
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,010
Okay. Okay.

359
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:26,929
[Dalton] When you're good.

360
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:34,102
[Cameron] <i>Hi, um, remember me
from a few weeks back?</i>

361
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:38,315
[chuckles] Yeah. You ate my chocolate bar.

362
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,444
See, I also purchased an Echo bar.

363
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,280
And I'm-- I'm hoping
you worked that out by now. Yeah.

364
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:48,909
Yeah. I'd have loved to see your face
when you realized. [laughs]

365
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,912
-[chuckles] Not a strong moment for me.
-[Poppy chuckles]

366
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:58,293
Oh, I just saw you, um, just sitting here,

367
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:02,381
and I-- I-- I made this thing.

368
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,049
[sighs] It's in my bag. Um…

369
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,760
Here you go.

370
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,474
[chuckles]

371
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,855
Wow! Wow, you're good.

372
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,233
Oh, thank you. Uh, I realize now

373
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,236
that even makes me look
more like a psycho.

374
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,864
-Oh, yeah? [laughs]
-But I'm not! I'm not. I promise.

375
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,992
A talented psycho is better
than a talentless one, so… [chuckles]

376
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,827
Yeah. I appreciate that.

377
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,413
I'm-- I'm Cameron, by the way.

378
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,542
Cameron. Poppy.

379
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:41,503
Poppy.

380
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:43,797
-Pleasure.
-[chuckles]

381
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,759
[chuckles] My stop's coming up.

382
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:52,097
Oh, okay. Um, all right.
Well, I'll let you go.

383
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,518
Sorry again for eating your candy bar.

384
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:59,146
-Um, I hope to see you around.
-[subway chimes]

385
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,815
<i>-The next station is Summit Park.</i>
-All right, best wishes.

386
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:05,861
[clicks tongue] Best wishes.

387
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,990
-Hey, Cameron?
-Hmm?

388
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,951
Um, here.

389
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,204
Oh, no, that's for you. Keep it.

390
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:16,872
Give it to me again.

391
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,082
Okay.

392
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,091
[Poppy chuckles]

393
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,808
Oh!

394
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:40,562
Poppy.

395
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,524
[overlapping chatter]

396
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,651
[Poppy vocalizing]

397
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,447
["Moon River" playing]

398
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,372
[speaks French]

399
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,998
[Poppy chuckling]

400
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:04,002
-Yeah? Are you scared yet?
-[Poppy chuckles] I'm a little bit scared.

401
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,879
Like, there's a lot going on there.

402
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:09,925
[Poppy and Cameron laugh]

403
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,052
You mean that awful thing
I made the other day?

404
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,431
-Oh!
-[Poppy] Yes!

405
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:19,476
Let me out.

406
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,562
You hold on a little bit.
I'm not ready for you.

407
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,188
-[Cameron chuckles]
-[Cory coos]

408
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,649
[Cameron] <i>Mmm.
We've been waiting so long for you.</i>

409
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:33,322
[Poppy] <i>She reminds me so much of Cory.
You're so sweet.</i>

410
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:34,658
-[Cory exclaims]
-[all laugh]

411
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,245
[Poppy] And then there was a third one.

412
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,873
I don't wanna look at you.
It makes me laugh.

413
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,880
-[Cameron laughs]
-Mommy.

414
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,674
-I'm not going back in.
-It's okay.

415
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,134
[music ends]

416
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,429
[Cory] <i>I saw her upstairs in her room,</i>

417
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,474
<i>and she was crying,
and she looked really sad.</i>

418
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,602
-[Andre exclaims]
-Is it because of Andre?

419
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:05,522
Cameron Turner, my twin brother, Andre.

420
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:07,983
Hey, Andre.

421
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,820
-[sobbing] I should have stopped him.
-No, no, no, no.

422
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:15,949
I should have stopped him. [sobbing]

423
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:19,244
It's my fault, Cam. It's my fault.

424
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:22,372
[inhales sharply, grunts]

425
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,875
Oh. [pants] I--

426
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,001
You good, Cameron?

427
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,297
-I'm sorry. I-I need a second.
-All right.

428
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,732
All right. Let's go.

429
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,445
[breathing heavily]

430
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,739
[Poppy] <i>You're booking days off now?</i>

431
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,784
[Cameron] Yeah, I booked time off
so we can hang out when I get back.

432
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,538
[Poppy] <i>I've been trying to peel you away
from your desk for the last six months.</i>

433
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:04,748
<i>Suddenly you're gung-ho
to drop everything.</i>

434
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,835
[Cameron] <i>I know. You're right. It's--</i>

435
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:11,922
[Poppy] <i>Bear?</i>

436
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,134
-<i>You good?</i>
-Yeah. Yes.

437
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:18,679
<i>Yeah?</i>

438
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,766
-[chuckles]
-<i>Are you sure you're happy about this?</i>

439
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:26,520
<i>Yeah. The last couple of weeks you just…</i>

440
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:28,730
I don't know. Just--

441
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:33,652
Uh, hey, P. I'm fine.
It's just work. I'm working.

442
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:37,072
I… I just hate being away from you.
That's all.

443
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,324
<i>And I just miss us.</i>

444
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,161
<i>When I get home, we're gonna hang out
and talk for real, okay?</i>

445
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,247
[Poppy] <i>Okay, Cameron.</i>

446
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,000
-[chuckles]
-[Cameron chuckles]

447
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,502
Oh, my God.

448
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:54,756
Okay, you're definitely taking the blame
for this specimen.

449
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,926
Uh, no.
I believe Cory picked that out himself.

450
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,180
-[Poppy] What? At three months?
<i>-Uh, yeah. Because I was with him.</i>

451
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,973
-[laughs]
-<i>We were in the store walking around,</i>

452
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:06,768
and I'm pushing him in the stroller.
And he's like, "Hey. Yo, big man.

453
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,563
You see that yellow mustard onesie
right there?

454
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,315
-I need that in my life."
-[laughing]

455
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,401
Yeah, he's so charming. I was like,
"Hey, what do you say to that?"

456
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:15,569
[both laugh]

457
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,405
Yeah, he is very charming.
I'll give you that.

458
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,410
-<i>But this is criminal.</i> [chuckles]
-Hmm.

459
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,715
[Cameron] <i>Together,
me and you will take care of her</i>

460
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:39,009
<i>till she can take care of herself again.
All right?</i>

461
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:43,430
Me and you gotta be strong for her, okay?
She's just sick right now.

462
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,516
Go away.

463
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,434
[chuckling] Wake up, man. Come on.

464
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,229
-[Cory moans]
-[roars]

465
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,898
[Cory] At least six more hours.

466
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,525
-[Cameron] Six more hours?
-Mm-hmm.

467
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,443
It's still dark outside. Look!

468
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:59,988
'Cause it's early.
But you gotta wake up, man. We gotta go.

469
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,449
Let this hand go. There, boom.

470
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,202
-And now flick it. Follow through.
-Boom.

471
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:07,204
[speaks French]

472
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,789
[imitates whoosh]

473
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,624
I used to do this all day in my room.

474
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,918
-That smells so good.
-You think?

475
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,672
-Kale. Kale. Kale. Mint. And mint.
-[laughs] Yes. All right.

476
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,091
Dip 'em in a little--
a little soy sauce. [pops lips]

477
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,009
Blip. Blip. Bloop.

478
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:22,678
-[Cameron] Blip, bloop.
-[Cory] Blip…

479
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,055
[Cameron and Cory chattering]

480
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:42,781
[technician] <i>Okay.
I'm standing by up here.</i>

481
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:46,410
[Cameron] How long will it take?

482
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,121
[technician] He should wake instantly.

483
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:55,169
Okay. [sighs] We're ready to go up here.

484
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,296
[Cameron sighs]

485
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,511
All right.

486
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,181
Okay.

487
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,767
Keep your eyes closed.

488
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,270
I'm gonna count you down from three.

489
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,731
And on three…

490
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,317
And two…

491
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,695
And one.

492
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,504
[inhales sharply]

493
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,593
[breathing heavily, gasping]

494
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:45,761
You're okay.

495
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,138
[Dr. Scott] Breathe.

496
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,061
-That's it?
-[technician] That's it.

497
00:39:58,482 --> 00:39:59,733
Everything go okay?

498
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:00,817
Everything went great.

499
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,157
When will I see him?

500
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:08,659
In the morning.

501
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,328
Until then, you should get some sleep.

502
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:21,004
[Dr. Scott] <i>For the time
that you are in this facility,</i>

503
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:24,466
that freckle is the only place
on your entire body

504
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,718
that isn't identical to his.

505
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,013
If you get confused,

506
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:35,185
you find that freckle
and you'll know who you are. Okay?

507
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,982
We know how strange this is.

508
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:41,066
[sighs]

509
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,696
[Dr. Scott] You got the good deal here.

510
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,991
You'll see.

511
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,704
-[Cory] <i>Boom!</i> [grunts] Again.
-[cheering on video game]

512
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,998
-[Cameron] Little chin music.
-[Cory] <i>You're going down.</i>

513
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,041
You don't know nothing about this, boy.

514
00:40:58,709 --> 00:40:59,710
-<i>Ooh!</i>
-Mm-mmm.

515

-[Cory grunts]
-You too young.

516
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,380
Uh-uh. Uh-uh, chump.

517
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,215
[chuckles] Yeah!

518
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,427
[laughs]

519
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,514
<i>Boom!</i>

520
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,976
-Oh! That's just another cheap left.
-[Cory] <i>Yeah, baby!</i>

[grunts, breathes shakily]

522

-[Dalton] <i>Hey, Cameron?</i>
-[Dr. Scott] <i>Talk to me, Cameron.</i>

525
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,824
-[Dalton] <i>No.</i>
-[Dr. Scott] <i>Send Poppy a message.</i>

526
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,159
[groans]

527
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:36,538
[sighs]

528
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:42,503
[Cameron] <i>They're saying
any of these seizures could kill me.</i>

529
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:48,425
And I could die out here this week
before getting home to see them.

530
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:56,808
I can't stop picturing her
getting the news, having to tell Cory.

531
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,609
Poppy and I had been
going through some stuff.

532
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,362
The other night I made her laugh.

533
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,865
I can't remember
the last time I did that, you know?

534
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,909
Just made her laugh.

535
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,079
That's because you're not funny.

536
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,749
[laughs]

537
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,876
Yeah, that too.

538
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:39,977
Those things will kill you, you know.

539
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,272
Oh, you are funny. Fuck that.

540
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:45,065
[chuckles]

541
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,150
[technician] Cameron?

542
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,319
We're ready for you.

543
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,074
[sighs]

544
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:56,910
See you later.

545
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:00,038
[Kate] Have fun.

546
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,423
[Jack] Poppy's the world's best sleeper.

547
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,968
[chuckles] When she's tired,
she'll just drift off in seconds,

548
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,595
like, out like a light.

549
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,514
[Dr. Scott] Poppy speaks French?

550
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,852
[Jack] Yeah, she'll still say
the occasional French word.

551
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:27,357
Like, she'll say, uh… [speaks French]

552
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,442
Or um…

553
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,989
[speaks French]

554
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,409
Or if something is great,
like, just perfect,

555
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,077
she might whisper, uh…

556
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,370
[speaks French]

557
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:43,874
[Jack chuckles]

558
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,418
[speaks French]

559
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:00,516
[Dr. Scott] You wanna go say hi?

560
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:14,655
[sighs]

561
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:33,173
You okay?

562
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:36,218
After last night?

563
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,931
Good.

564
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,522
I don't know how to, uh…

565
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,568
Uh, what to say here.

566
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:57,531
I know you don't think I'm…

567
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,331
You. Uh…

568
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,632
I'm sitting up in that room,
looking at Rafa.

569
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:20,053
[Jack] <i>My heart is beating
out of my chest, and, um, I'm nervous.</i>

570
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,306
I'm really nervous.

571
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,936
Then Dad pops in my head.

572
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:34,359
That first trip out to see him
after they split.

573
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,779
Getting on that airplane.

574
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:40,991
Just the nerves, you know?

575
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,160
And I close my eyes.

576
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:47,873
And then I open 'em.

577
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:52,753
[inhales sharply]

578
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,506
[Jack] I'm not up there
in that room anymore.

579
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,259
I'm here.

580
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,056
I am here.

581
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:12,523
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

582
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,737
[exhales slowly]

583
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,659
[Dr. Scott] He knows you're nervous, Jack.

584
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,745
Just answer the questions.

585
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,670
-[AR assistant] <i>Audio muted.</i>
-[Dr. Scott] Cameron…

586
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:37,256
you're you.

587
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,552
There are no wrong answers.

588
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,310
[AR assistant] <i>Audio unmuted.</i>

589
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:54,731
[Dr. Scott] Okay, Jack.
Poppy works with children.

590
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:58,277
[Jack] Yeah, she teaches
kids with learning difficulties

591
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,153
through, uh, music therapy.

592
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:03,866
She's got her own take
on the Orff Schulwerk method.

593
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:11,790
So, um, she makes songs with the kids,
and she puts them in the songs.

594
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:15,210
And… they love it.

595
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:20,257
Mmm. She's just insanely talented.

596
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:27,222
She cares. You know?
Like, she really cares.

597
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,975
[Dr. Scott] <i>Did you always want children?</i>

598
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:31,476
[Poppy hums]

599
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,520
[Cameron] Mmm.

600
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:35,439
Ah, I like this, Cameron Turner.

601
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:39,026
I think after I met Poppy,
I realized I wanted kids.

602
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,694
-I like all of this.
-[Cameron chuckles]

603
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:42,321
-Yeah.
-[Poppy chuckles]

604
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,573
[Jack] <i>I was cynical for a long time.</i>

605
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,701
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

606
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:51,872
We have scarily similar taste in books.

607
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:56,210
{\an8}[Jack] <i>This idea
of finding true love or a soul mate.</i>

608
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:01,256
[Jack] <i>Then someone like Poppy comes along
and you realize you're just surviving.</i>

609
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,341
Do you play?

610
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:05,302
Uh, I butcher.

611
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,680
But I-- I'm not playing in front of you.

612
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,767
[Jack] I could have
just gone on like that forever.

613
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,687
[Poppy] ♪ <i>You better stop
And think about what you doing</i> ♪

614
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:23,237
-[laughs] Oh, I love it. Yes.
-[Poppy laughs]

615
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,530
I just lucked out, I guess.

616
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:28,075
[Dr. Scott] Good.

617
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:32,287
[Dr. Scott] Talk about
your parents' relationship.

618
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,916
[Jack] Well, there's not really
much to talk about.

619
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,962
They divorced when I was five,
and my dad moved away for work.

620
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,131
He was a doctor. A pediatrician.

621
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:48,011
[waves lapping]

622
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:56,687
He looks like me.
He sounds like me, but I don't know…

623
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:02,025
In seven months, that child is gonna
come into the world without a dad.

624
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:07,447
Seven months.

625
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:10,367
Hey. At least you're not
feeling sorry for yourself.

626
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:13,370
[chuckling] Oh, okay. That's fair.

627
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:15,622
You're gonna be good, man.

628
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:16,707
That's fair.

629
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:22,045
And what about you? How you doing?

630
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:24,298
Me?

631
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,550
Never better.

632
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,759
Any other great questions?

633
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:29,344
No. Okay.

634
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,305
[Kate] Yep.

635
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,974
Having the time of my life out here.

636
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,977
-[Cameron laughs]
-Nature's awesome. Great food.

637
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,645
[Cameron laughs]

638
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,402
Cameron?

639
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:47,863
Make it obscure.

640
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:52,492
[Cameron] Andre. Gift.

641
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,830
[Poppy] Am I actually gonna like this?

642
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,916
-Probably not. It's probably--
-Oh, God. What?

643
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,084
-[Cameron] Lift your feet up high.
-Lift my feet up where?

644
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:04,087
-[Cameron] And step. Step. Step.
-[Andre] Whoa! Oops. Oh, no! No! Oh.

645
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,631
-There we go. There you go.
-[Poppy laughs]

646
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,299
We're safe. We're safe.

647
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:08,884
[Poppy] What is it?

648
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:15,265
-Oh! You got me a piano!
-[claps]

649
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,808
[gasps] Oh.

650
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:19,228
Andre!

651
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:21,730
Oh, my God.

652
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:24,816
-Thank you so much.
-[Jack] <i>And he was so like Poppy.</i>

653
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,904
<i>Like, just wildly smart and gentle.</i>

654
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,448
[Dr. Scott] What happened to him?

655
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:39,039
Andre, uh… was thrown from his bike
off of a mountain road.

656
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:45,087
His body landed in the branches
of a pine tree, high up.

657
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:50,592
[Jack] <i>Every couple of weeks, I dream
about him up there in the treetops.</i>

658
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,803
[no audible dialogue]

659
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:55,472
[Jack] <i>Alone. Just laying there.</i>

660
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:04,273
[Dr. Scott] Have you talked to your wife
about that dream?

661
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:05,357
No.

662
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,025
Why not?

663
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:10,279
She didn't leave the house
for the better part of a year.

664
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:16,201
Slept in the guest room
most of that time, so…

665
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:17,786
I'm just trying to help you.

666
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:18,871
[sniffles]

667
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:21,748
I know, I know.

668
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,877
-I need to be alone. Thank you.
-Please--

669
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,506
It's not really subject matter
we enjoy getting into.

670
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,678
[Dr. Scott] How did Poppy sleeping apart
make you feel?

671
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:37,806
Alone.

672
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,851
Mostly, I worried about her.

673
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:43,395
I missed her.

674
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:47,107
[Dr. Scott] Did you resent her for it?

675
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:50,402
-[Jack] <i>She lost her twin.</i>
-[Poppy sobbing]

676
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:54,740
[Jack] <i>She never felt good
about him getting that motorcycle.</i>

677
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:59,161
<i>Blamed herself for not protesting more.</i>

678
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,914
<i>But he was gonna get the bike anyway.</i>

679
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:06,960
[Dr. Scott] You've mentioned how well
Poppy has progressed with her therapist

680
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,462
over the last few months.

681
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,131
But you never went to see anybody?

682
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:13,300
[Jack] No. No.

683
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,888
[Dr. Scott] Did you talk to someone
after your parents were divorced?

684
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,890
[Jack chuckling] No, I was five.

685
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:23,810
[Dr. Scott]
So you've never been to a therapist?

686
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:24,895
[Jack] No.

687
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:28,815
[Dr. Scott] And you can't talk to Poppy
about this dream that you keep having?

688
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:32,653
It's been two years.
Why haven't you gone to see somebody?

689
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:33,737
I don't know.

690
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:38,075
[Dr. Scott] Cameron?

691
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,411
I'm sorry, I--

692
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,001
I'm sorry.

693
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,254
[Dr. Scott] It's okay.

694
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,217
Let's take a break.

695
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,493

[Dr. Scott] <i>All right.</i>

697
00:53:42,723 --> 00:53:45,392
Jack, are you ready?

698
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:46,894
Yeah.

699
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:49,104
-[Dr. Scott] Cameron?
-Yeah.

700
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,482
All right.

I just spoke to the clinic.</i>

704
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:11,084
<i>Doctor Herbert is confirmed
for the ultrasound on the 25th.</i>

705
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:17,633
<i>Cam?</i>

706
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,053
That's real.

707
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:25,557
<i>Yeah. So real. Living human in body.</i>

708
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:28,727
[Jack] Just feels so different
to how I remember it with Cory, right?

709
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,811
<i>Yeah.</i>

710
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,774
Remember how we found out?

711
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:37,736
[Poppy chuckles] <i>Oh, my God, yeah.
That insane snow.</i>

712
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,113
<i>Jessie and Zoe's wedding the next day.</i>

713
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:42,449
[chuckles] Zoe knew right away.

714
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,578
-<i>"Oh, my God. You're pregnant, Poppy."</i>
-[both laugh]

715
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:50,749
[Jack] Oh, I remember that feeling.

716
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:52,668
You were barely
out of the doctor's office,

717
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:54,920
you were already making a playlist,
holding the speaker there.

718
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:59,842
[Poppy laughs] <i>Yeah. Yes. Womb tunes.</i>

719
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:03,595
Womb tunes. Oh, it's been a minute.

720
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,932
<i>Mmm. Hey, we should tell Cory soon, too.</i>

721
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:10,310
[Jack] Yeah, I was thinking the same--

722
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,605
[Dr. Scott] Rafa, send Poppy a message.

723
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:17,776
-What did you do?
-I don't like this.

724
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,575
And you think I like this?
Talking to my wife under a spotlight?

725
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,118
She's not your wife!

726
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:29,663
Oh, okay. Okay, I see. [chuckles]

727
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:32,583
You can't bear to see this actually work.
That's the real problem.

728
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,251
-Fuck you, man!
-Fuck you!

729
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:37,129
And what about me?
Waking up in this place,

730
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,548
waiting for you to pull the plug,
being told I'm not me.

731
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,049
Because you're not me.

732
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:45,721
You are not me! [panting]

733
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:49,683
You know what? Fuck all this.

734
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:52,227
-No, bullshit. You stay right here.
-This is bullshit! Fuck that!

735
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:54,855
-[Jack] Stay here. Bullshit. This is real.
-Open the fucking door!

736
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:56,773
And you know it. You know it.

737
00:55:56,857 --> 00:56:00,485
Poppy said if she couldn't tell,
if her mom was indistinguishable…

738
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:02,821
Well, here it is. Indistinguishable.

739
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,073
You won't go through with it
because you're too selfish!

740
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:06,658
Get the fuck off me.

741
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:08,869
I'm done with you. Huh?

742
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:12,497
Do something?
Do it. Fuck you, do it. Do it!

743
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:16,251
Yeah. You won't leave this place.

744
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:19,588
I'm going home, and I'm telling them
everything. Everything!

745
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,341
Yeah, I bet you will. Bitch ass.

746
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,426
It's always about you.
It's always about you.

747
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,220
She's been trying to talk
for I don't know how long,

748
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:27,387
and you keep shutting her out,

749
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,806
because deep down inside,
you feel like she abandoned us.

750
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,892
-I never thought that! I never!
-[Jack] You did!

751

three months ago.

the headache back then--

Don't do that.

Aw.

867
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:24,372
[Jack sighs]

868
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,131
[Poppy] <i>You scared me.</i>

869
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:36,009
-<i>I scared me.</i> [chuckles]
-[chuckles, sniffles]

870
01:09:48,438 --> 01:09:50,357
He's waiting for you up in his room.

871
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:55,904
-Who?
-[chuckles] Your son.

872
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:04,413
Shut up.

873
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:09,084
-[laughs]
-Asshole. [sighs]

874
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,377
I'm sorry, I had to.

875
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,796
Shit, Cam. Don't freak me out like that.

876
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,673
-Aw.
-Wanker.

877
01:10:15,257 --> 01:10:16,717
-Come here.
-No.

878
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,552
Come here. Come here.

879
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:21,346
-No way. [chuckles]
-I'm sorry.

880
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:25,100

885
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:34,568
Pig.

886
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:36,195
[Poppy] What the hell? Ellington?

887
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:38,655
Hey, pal.

888
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,867
Wow, I think Pig's pissed at you

889
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,995
for leaving town
and hitting your head. [chuckles]

890
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:48,999
Wow, he is not letting it go. Ellington.

891
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,878
-[Ellington barks]
-Okay, Pig. Uh--

892
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,379
I'll stick him outside.

893
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:57,216
I'll go check on Doc.

894
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:00,636
[Poppy chuckles]

895
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,888

[breathing heavily]

897
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:27,079
[grunts] Hey.

898
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:31,792
[breathing heavily] Ra-- What happened?

899
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:33,669
You passed out.

900
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:39,383
You've been unconscious
for almost 24 hours.

901
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:42,553
What does Poppy think?

902
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:44,972
Everything's fine, Cameron.

903
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:48,642
What does that mean?

904
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:53,689
He's not gone.

905
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:58,318
We've been monitoring it all
while you were out. Everything's good.

906
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:01,780
No. No, no, no. I didn't get--

907
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:03,699
I'm so sorry that it happened this way…

908
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:05,200
I'm not done. I didn't say he could go.

909
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,160
-…but it was the right decision.
-Bullshit.

910
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:08,704
I'm not done!

911
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:10,330
Well, it's not about you now.

912
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:11,915
Excuse me?

913
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:15,419
-You have an opportunity that no one gets.
-No. No, no, no.

914
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,004
Don't be blind, Cameron.

915
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:18,505
-Fuck you.
-You're dying.

916
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:24,344
You're dying.

917
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:32,477
-You're dying, Cam--
-Stop!

918
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:34,938
Stop.

919
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:41,403
Jack was ready.

920
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:44,072
They're in good hands.

921
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:48,702
They're in your hands.

922
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:55,167
I wanna see the video.

923
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:58,504
Now.

924
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,341
And you need to stop watching my family.

925
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:09,598
[Cory] <i>I-- I learned that from school.
Paper is wood.</i>

926
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,350
[Jack chuckles] <i>Yes.</i>

927
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,519
-<i>It's got some-- Let me see.</i>
-<i>Is it?</i>

928
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,479
[Jack] <i>Some wood up there.</i>

929
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:18,941
-[Cory chuckles] <i>Yeah.</i> Yes, sir.
-[Jack chuckles]

930
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:22,861
-[Cameron] This the only feed?
-[Jack] <i>Mmm. Okay.</i>

931
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:23,946
[Dalton] Yes.

932
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:26,281
I'd like to be alone.

933
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:28,075
[Cory] <i>Nope.</i>

934
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,828
[Jack] <i>So, what's one thing
I've been trying to get you to do more of?</i>

935
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:36,542
-<i>Read?</i>
-<i>Ah. Good.</i>

936
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:39,628
<i>Here's a little something for you.</i>

937
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:41,338
<i>Essentially, it's from your grandmother.</i>

938
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:43,924
<i>It's something she gave to me
when I was about your age.</i>

939
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:46,218
<i>Open it up, it's a good one.</i>

940
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,220
[Cory] <i>Okay.</i>

941
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:50,180
[Jack] <i>She wrote a little something in it.</i>

942
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:56,520
[rain pattering]

943
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:59,022
[Poppy] <i>I used to kill Andre
for doing this to our books</i>

944
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:00,607
<i>-when we were growing up.</i>
-[Jack chuckles]

945
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:04,653
[chuckles] <i>Now I'm, like, poring over
every word he underlined.</i>

946
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:10,701
[Poppy chuckles, sniffs]

947
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,081
<i>Somehow I'm--</i>

948
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,337
<i>Somehow I'm finally breathing again.</i>

949
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:27,634
<i>But I feel like I've lost you, Cam.</i>

950
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:34,433
[sobs] <i>You keep yourself so busy
in a job you hate.</i>

951
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:36,435
<i>It's like you're not here.</i>

952
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:41,690
<i>And I'm not saying you're fully to blame,
you know?</i> <i>We're both in this.</i>

953
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,987
<i>I know I checked out for a while.</i>

954
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:49,865
<i>And I know that scared you.</i>

955
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:55,078
<i>And I'm sorry for that, Cam. I am.</i>

956
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:58,248
[Poppy crying, sniffing]

957
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:02,836
<i>I mean, hearing you say the words,
"I hit my head," the other day…</i>

958
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:11,845
<i>I couldn't lose you, Cam. I couldn't live.</i>

959
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:22,648
<i>So this is me telling you
that I'm done with the silence now.</i>

960
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:29,196
<i>We start communicating, and we fix things.</i>

961
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,193
Oh.

962
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,030
I made you a little something.

963
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,592
It's really insensitive.

964
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:39,016
Oh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

965
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:41,602
Oh, shit. I'm so so--

966
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:46,732
You little shit.

967
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:50,402
You scared me.

968
01:16:50,903 --> 01:16:52,613
Your face. It's-- It's--

969
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:54,615
You scared me. That was good.

970
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,494
It is… It's good. Funny.

[ragged breathing]

974
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:14,426
You're okay.

975
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:22,351
I'm here. You're okay.

[Cameron] <i>He's taking out the contacts
more and more,</i>

977
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,415
<i>not just when he goes to bed.</i>

978
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,960
He doesn't have to wear them all the time.
They make him feel uncomfortable.

979
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:32,045
He feels badly for you.

980
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:36,216
But he also feels uncomfortable
having his family watched.

981
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,635
I don't give a shit about his comfort.
That's my family.

982
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,638
What you're feeling right now,
Cameron, is normal.

983
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:43,223
No, it is not.

984
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,142
Something is wrong.

985
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:47,519
For the last couple of days, I feel it.
Something is off.

986
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:48,812
At this stage,

987
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:53,650
whatever you're going through,
it's normal. He's fine.

988
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:55,986
Yeah.

-[Jack] Cory, it's time to eat, buddy.

01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:03,971
Cory. Pause it.

01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:06,265
Cory, come on.

994
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:07,850
What do you think?

995
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:13,772
-I like it. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm?

996
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:16,525
-Pecorino instead of Parmesan.
-So good.

997
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:18,360
-Mmm, yeah. [chuckles]
-[Jack] Mmm.

998
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,490
Come on, man. Now. Pause it.

999
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,493
[Poppy] Less salty, right?
Kind of sweeter?

1000
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:27,995
Yeah. It's great.

But it's okay. We won't tell anybody.

1039
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:03,862
-Hmm? [chuckles]
-[Cory] Yeah.

1040
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:08,534
And these guys were her favorite thing
to eat with beer.

1041
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:13,163
Edamame with loads of salt.

1042
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:16,625
Washed down with a nice, crisp brew.

1043
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,086
-Yum.
-How do you eat it?

1044
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:22,631
Hmm, see? Just grab the top one.
Start one at a time with the top one.

1045
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,510
Hmm, pop it out. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

1046
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,055
-Tastes good.
-Mmm, good, right?

1047
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:32,683
Better than they look.

1048
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:35,269
Yeah, now try it with your beer.

1049
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:37,062
Okay.

1050
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:41,942
[Cameron] Mmm, apple juice, but--
Hold up, hold on. Cheers.

1051
01:30:44,903 --> 01:30:47,197
-Long life for you.
-[Cory chuckles]

1052
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:49,032
-To edamame.
-[chuckles]

1053
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:54,162
-Ah.
-Mmm.

1054
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:05,007
I'll just take one more.

1055
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:07,217
Come here, man.

1058
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:35,454
You okay, Dad?

1059
01:31:42,628 --> 01:31:45,547
Let me look at you, man.
Let me look at that face.

1060
01:31:51,011 --> 01:31:52,471
Yeah, I'm okay.

1061
01:31:56,642 --> 01:31:57,643
I'm okay.

1062
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:03,315
Cory?

1063
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:05,067
Yes?

1064
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:07,945
I love you, man.

1065
01:32:08,946 --> 01:32:10,364
I love you too, Dad.

1066
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:18,914
[Cameron] I know.

1067
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:36,390
Be good, Doc.

1071
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:28,275
[Cameron] P?

1072
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:31,528
-Mm-hmm?
-P.

1073
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:37,826
I love you.

1074
01:33:43,874 --> 01:33:45,000
Poppy, wake up.

1075
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:48,795
Hmm? [sniffs, sighs]

1076
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:53,467
Bear, what's wrong?

1077
01:33:55,093 --> 01:33:56,094
What's wrong?

1078
01:33:58,388 --> 01:33:59,556
It's nothing. I just--

1079
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:03,852
I just had a really bad dream.

1080
01:34:04,436 --> 01:34:07,606
I got angry at Cory.
Dreamt I lost everything.

1081
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:10,108
Oh, baby.

1082
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:13,320
Come here. Aw.

1083
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:16,240
Aw. [Poppy hums]

1084
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:20,494
God, you're shaking, sweetheart.
You're shaking.

1085
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:22,913
[Cameron breathing shakily]
It felt so real.

1086
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:26,166
Oh, sweetheart.

1087
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:31,463
-We're here. Yeah?
-Yes.

1088
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:37,469
We're doing better now. Yeah?

1089
01:34:39,805 --> 01:34:43,141
Mmm. Yeah, we're doing great.

1090
01:34:45,143 --> 01:34:46,144
[chuckles]

1091
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:49,773
If it's a boy…

1092
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,360
we should name him Andre.

1093
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:55,779
Mmm, yeah. I know.

1094
01:34:57,447 --> 01:34:59,700

1095
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:05,789

Poppy?

1098
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:22,931
Yeah?

1099
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:31,982
I drifted.

1100
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:38,280
Cam, stop it. Come here.

1101
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:44,369
I'm so sorry. I just--

1102

1103
01:35:46,246 --> 01:35:47,247

And it's wonderful.

-Mm-hmm.

01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:00,802

Take care of 'em.

As of this morning,
he's officially Cameron Turner.

1122
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,055
He'll never know about any of this.

1123
01:39:34,766 --> 01:39:35,767
Good.

1124
01:39:39,188 --> 01:39:40,189
Good.

1125
01:39:46,737 --> 01:39:47,738
Thank you, Doc.

Thank you.

It's hard to be left behind.

1128
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:16,683
The new client is about to arrive.

1129
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:22,272
Come down to us
when you're done speaking with him.

1130
