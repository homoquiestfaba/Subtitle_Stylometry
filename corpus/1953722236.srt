1
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,120
Most Koreans blindly follow the path
their parents set for them:

2
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,040
Elementary school, middle school,
high school and university.

3
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,440
Everyone takes that route.

4
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,120
I chose a different path.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,680
I became a professional gamer.

6
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My name is Lee Jae Dong
and I'm a Korean pro gamer.

7
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,720
I belong to the Hwaseung Oz team and
I'm number One in the KeSPA ranking.

8
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,320
I made my debut when I was 16.

9
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,880
I had a top score in 2007. A year later
I was making a 135,000 euros a year.

10
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,160
Is it good ? Is it good ?

11
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,520
- Are you using your fingers ?
- Yes, I am.

12
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,800
Seriously. That's fucking awesome.

13
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,560
You have to tweak it like this...

14
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,760
Yes, that's it. Good.

15
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,520
I don't know why it still hurts.

16
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
Dong-Joon, your hair looks good today.

17
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,400
Your hair gets prettier every day.

18
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,360
I think I'll dye my hair blue-black.

19
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,320
Really ? From now on ?

20
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Yesterday, I won all the games
during practice.

21
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,680
Against Ki-Hyun. I am confident.

22
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,920
The game we play is called StarCraft.
It's a real-time strategy game.

23
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,120
It's already more than a decade old
but we're still playing it.

24
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,160
He's going to lose his expansion.
Lee Jae Dong is fighting extremely well.

25
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,400
This expansion is getting harassed.
Lee Jae Dong is playing impressively!

26
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,280
The match is over. It's the man himself!
Lee Jae Dong takes the victory.

27
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,000
Should I do the thing I usually do ?
Fast hydra ?

28
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
And try that sneaky wall-climbing.

29
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,040
StarCraft is like a mix
of chess and poker.

30
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,080
Every game is a battle
and I try to outsmart my opponent.

31
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,400
I predict the other player's strategy
and then I destroy him.

32
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,320
He's going in.
This is easily taken out.

33
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
The game is over.
Byung Koo Song is defeated.

34
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,400
Jeez, I almost thought I'd lost.

35
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,920
Lee Jae Dong! Victory!

36
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,760
At the start of your career, you decide
your race: Terran, Protoss or Zerg.

37
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,160
I became a Zerg.

38
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,760
The Dark Swarm! Thus must be
what Jae Dong Lee had in mind.

39
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,880
One more time, one more time.

40
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,080
Wow, Jae Dong Lee,
He fights against time.

41
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Multi-tasking and decisiveness are vital.
But so are confidence and bluff.

42
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,080
You don't reach the top without them.

43
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,280
Lee Jae Dong's fighting in the centre
of the map tells us all.

44
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,160
Lee Jae Dong wins this game.

45
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,200
Lee Jae Dong clenches his fist.
He's won all of today's games.

46
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,200
He succeeds in his first all-kill
of the season. Truly amazing.

47
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,280
Lee Jae Dong is definitely worthy
of the "first ever, and first Zerg".

48
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
He is the first to execute
an All-Kill this season.

49
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:44,000
No matter what, I am always ready
for an All-Kill as the first player.

50
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,920
My name is Park Yo Han. I'm 16 years old
and I live in Cheonan.

51
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,960
I don't really like to study.
I want to be successful early in life.

52
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:31,760
I have comparatively slow fingers.
But still 260 to 270 Actions Per Minute.

53
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,680
I try to improve my APM. I'm getting better
slowly. I think I can be faster still.

54
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,800
My dream is to become a great pro gamer,
just like Lee Jae Dong.

55
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm training hard to realise that dream.

56
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,720
Why do you keep opening new bottles of
water while the bottle isn't empty ?

57
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,840
I prepare for the semi-pro competition,
an important tournament for amateurs.

58
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,400
I played in the tournament 6 or 7 times
and I failed every time.

59
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,360
If I fail again this time,
I know I will try again.

60
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,640
Park Che Hyun ?
I've never heard of this guy.

61
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,280
I was 16 when I left my home town
of Ulsan and came to Seoul.

62
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,240
The Team House has been my home
for half of my teenage years.

63
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,040
I only go home for the holidays.

64
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,720
The players are my brothers.
We're like a family.

65
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,560
Take a deep breath,

66
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,680
and imagine the air goes in at
the shoulder and out at the fingertips.

67
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:15,400
Now you can stretch your arms.
Do you feel the peace in your mind ?

68
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,840
HWASEUNG.... GO FIGHT!

69
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,080
Our training schedule is very rigid.

70
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,560
We practice 10 to 12 hours a day.

71
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,800
We don't really play for fun anymore.
Mostly I play for work.

72
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,040
My work just happens to be a game.

73
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,000
When I was 11, I watched gamers playing
StarCraft on TV for the first time.

74
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,040
It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.

75
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:28,960
A few months ago I won the semi-pro
tournament, the gateway to becoming a pro.

76
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,600
But that's only the beginning.

77
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,640
If I get drafted by a team,
then the real challenge starts.

78
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,280
Hello, my name is Lee Gun Hee.

79
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,120
I am hard-working and
I guess I have always been desperate.

80
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,200
I am Park Yong Soo, the youngest semi-pro.
I am 15 years old.

81
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,840
Everyone respects Jae Dong
as the best Zerg player.

82
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,920
So do I, but I'm sure that the only
player who can beat him is me.

83
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,120
I have a dream of reaching the top.

84
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,720
I will train so hard
that my wrists will wear out,

85
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,720
and if you pick me I will use all the
power that I got from my mother's milk.

86
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:42,200
I will adapt well to life in the Team House
and will never give up easily. Thank you.

87
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,200
So, minors. You all go to school now.

88
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,520
Can you really live in the Team House ?

89
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,680
Don't hesitate. Can you do it or not ?
All of you.

90
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,400
My school has granted permission.

91
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,520
You have permission ?
Who from ?

92
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
From my class teacher.

93
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,760
So your teacher knows StarCraft ?

94
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,440
Huh ? He knows about this league.

95
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,040
So apparently there is only place
for one more Zerg.

96
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,320
We will draft Kim Joon Hyuk.

97
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:25,160
Woongjin Stars has drafted
the last Zerg left: Kim Joon Hyuk.

98
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:59,680
In the 21st century, people like you,
who are agile and quick decision makers,

99
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,880
will play an important role
in society.

100
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,000
And what's the key thing here ?
Games.

101
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:15,080
And who is best in the world at games ?
You guys. Am I right ?

102
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:24,440
People say: You work when you work,
and you play when you play.

103
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:34,440
That is an old-fashioned concept.
Nowadays they are converging.

104
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,840
This day and age, there's been a change.

105
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The ones who work more
can also play better.

106
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,560
And the ones who play better
increase their productivity.

107
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:56,160
This new concept: the invention
of eSports, enjoying an eSport,

108
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,760
was a cultural invention
of the 21st century.

109
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,440
Who invented it ? Yes, us!

110
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,120
I feel like I can win every game today.

111
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm going to win the semi-pro tournament.
- Nonsense.

112
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
I am serious.
I can feel that I am going to win.

113
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,080
Try to have fun.

114
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,760
Excuse me, but is this chair
usually like this ?

115
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,280
Mom ?

116
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,600
Oh Mom, this is so unfair.

117
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,520
I almost won but there was a malfunction.

118
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,520
The game was bugged.

119
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,840
This is a Lee Jae Dong Calendar from 2011

120
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,880
and there are autographs
from other players and coaches.

121
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,800
This sticker came with the calendar
and I got it,

122
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,920
because I was among
the first fifty people to order it.

123
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,240
And this is everything I have collected
relating to Jae Dong...

124
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,920
I like Lee Jae Dong because of his eyes,

125
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,120
when he's playing
and because of his performance.

126
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,800
I also like the fact
that he trains so hard all the time.

127
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:38,760
Other gamers told me that Jae Dong always
trains hard when he's in the Team House.

128
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,240
He doesn't even see the sunlight.

129
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,920
That's probably why I have a crush on him.

130
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,360
He is my role model.

131
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,880
In the professional league of
the popular game StarCraft,

132
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,640
players have been discovered
to fix matches for profit.

133
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,120
It was a first in professional gaming.
Famous gamers were found to be involved.

134
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:20,120
The pro gamers of the game StarCraft
were fixing matches via betting sites.

135
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,280
Every sport has its scandal, it seems.

136
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,880
But I never thought pro gamers would
lose a match just to make money.

137
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
A shock-wave went through the industry.

138
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,360
So many fans were disappointed.

139
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,440
The investigation showed that pro gamers
told the other player their strategies.

140
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,520
Or they made mistakes and made thousands
of dollars by losing their matches.

141
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,880
This scandal has tainted our public image.

142
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,800
StarCraft is not just a game anymore.

143
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,000
For eSports, it's the death of innocence.

144
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,840
To comrades, to fans,

145
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,920
to everyone who is involved
in eSports.

146
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,200
How can you just stab them in the back ?

147
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,360
If they were next to me,

148
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,200
I would slap them in the face.

149
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,640
Is a slap enough ?

150
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,040
If a slap isn't enough,
then what is ?

151
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,280
MATCH-FIXING

152
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,520
Tattooed on their faces ?

153
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,480
Corporate sponsors started hesitating

154
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,520
and three teams had to close down.

155
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,840
My team was one of them.

156
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,280
All of a sudden, my home
of the last five years was gone.

157
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,320
I had no other choice
than to move back in with my parents.

158
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,040
Let me help you... Isn't it heavy ?

159
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,520
You look good..
- No... I don't, look at my skin.

160
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,480
I have to say,

161
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,880
you look calm and composed,
compared to before.

162
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,120
Now you are really reaching
the spiritual realm.

163
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,920
Well, I'm gaining experience.

164
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:15,000
Jae Dong is now a senior
among the pro gamers.

165
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,000
In my house, I don't let my children
play video games.

166
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:21,880
We don't even have broadband internet
in this area to play those games.

167
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,920
But when my child told his friends
at school about Jae Dong,

168
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,600
they said: "Really ? Are you serious ?"

169
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,480
I don't know much about it, but among
gamers he seems a really big name.

170
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,440
I don't know it either...

171
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,880
But you must be really good, no ?

172
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,960
By now, you must start thinking
of retiring.

173
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,120
In the meantime, you should learn who
you are and who your ancestors are.

174
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,880
Having done that, you can have an idea
of what you are going to do next.

175
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes, I understand.

176
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,840
But what kind of industry on earth
makes you retire when you are only 28 ?

177
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,680
Playing games consumes
a lot of your energy and stamina.

178
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,520
How do you deal with the prize money ?

179
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,800
Jae Dong, do you give everything
to your father ?

180
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Yes, I do.

181
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,160
Hwaseung was the team
where I started my career.

182
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,520
People say I should be okay.
That I will find a new team soon.

183
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,320
But this is the first time I'm really
worried about my future.

184
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,160
Sometimes I wonder:
"What is my passion in life ?"

185
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,480
And when I look at you, I see it must
be really tough to work so hard.

186
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,200
I mean, it just feels so comfortable
to lie down and watch TV.

187
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,960
Because I didn't go to school,
my passion was even stronger.

188
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,080
All of my friends go to school...

189
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,720
and they have girlfriends.

190
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,960
I mean, I can't do any of that.

191
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,720
Correct. It really upsets me.

192
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,760
So I told myself I have to work harder
in what I do

193
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,400
because I can't enjoy the things
that everyone else can.

194
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,320
Maybe I am just wasting my time.

195
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,480
When you are 20, everyone should enjoy
those things in life.

196
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,160
Being 20 is like the best moment
of your life, with so much drive.

197
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,680
Instead, I'm cooped up in the Team House
training every single day.

198
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,120
The day I entered the Team House,
I was very excited.

199
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:22,200
But now, after 3 months,
I'm lonely. I miss my parents and friends.

200
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,200
I have to work harder than my team mates.
That's the hardest part:

201
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,520
I have to play and still go to school.

202
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,920
My team, Woongjin Stars,
currently has about 15 enlisted players.

203
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,280
There's a big difference
between Team A and Team B.

204
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,040
We still have to prove ourselves
so we help in the kitchen.

205
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,640
We clean up, do the laundry,
all those things.

206
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,840
We don't have separate rooms either.

207
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,000
When I've been through all this
I can become a Team A member.

208
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,800
With enough effort I think I can make it
in 1 or 2 months.

209
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,520
Aren't you swapping these too ? How can
you play like this ? 'O' should be here.

210
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,320
Yes, swap them. It is really confusing.

211
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,600
- And this is also wrong.
- Shouldn't the "I" be here ?

212
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,240
Take a look at my keyboard.

213
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,600
'O', 'I'. I told you!

214
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,720
'O' and 'I'... See, I told you!

215
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,040
We were almost screwed because of you.

216
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,400
Today are the qualifications
of the Elite School League.

217
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,520
I've persuaded some of my classmates
to make a team.

218
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,360
If we win, we will get
the Semi-Pro license.

219
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,120
Last year we came very close,

220
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,000
but I was the one
who lost the decisive game.

221
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,040
I don't want to make
the same mistake again.

222
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,040
Check out his nose.

223
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,840
He has no bone there.

224
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,680
You really don't ?

225
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,280
How is that possible ?
I have a bone here.

226
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,200
It's here. I do have a bone there
but it is very flexible.

227
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,720
Your nose won't break
even if it's punched.

228
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,680
Maybe you just like to play video games
and you are a bit better than others.

229
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,800
In a way, your dream might
be impossible to achieve,

230
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,280
so I am a little bit worried about that.

231
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,800
I'd better put a bit more effort
into my studies,

232
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,160
like not dozing off in class,

233
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,480
and to get better grades.

234
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,440
Maybe I go to high school first
and then I can decide what to do.

235
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,440
I agree with you.

236
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,840
Life in High School and with your friends
has its own beauty.

237
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,440
But if you just decide
to skip that entirely,

238
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,400
as you get older, you might regret it.

239
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,760
It's true, you might regret it.

240
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:49,720
By following your dream to be a pro gamer,
your life might be slightly different.

241
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,360
I also think it's better
to go to high school,

242
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,480
and to finish your education.

243
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,120
When I was still at my parents' home
I got a phone call from KeSPA.

244
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,040
They were going to form a new team
with only top players.

245
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,320
A dream team made from the 3 teams
that were disbanded.

246
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,960
Coming from the Hwaseung Team with me
there's my old friend Baxter.

247
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,480
Coach Han joined the Team as well.

248
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,080
Then there's Yum Bo Sung.

249
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,560
He's loud, tough and a real team player.

250
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,480
Jae Hoon is the team's captain.

251
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,200
Because he sweats a lot during the game,
some people call him Sweatoss.

252
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,920
The youngest player is Jun Tae Yang.
His nickname is Baby.

253
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,600
He was only 12 when he became a pro.

254
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,600
Finally, there's Park Soo Bom.
As his nickname suggests,

255
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,320
he plays heavy-weight like Tyson.

256
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,160
They will call us the 8th Team.

257
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,440
Son Yejin or Han Chaeyoung ?

258
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,080
Of course I go for Son Yejin.
Why do you even bring up Han Chaeyoung ?

259
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,560
- Son Yejin or Lee Minjung ?
- Son Yehin.

260
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,520
Son Yejin or Moon Chaewon ?
- I go for Moon Chaewon!

261
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
I go for Moon Chaewon too.

262
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,360
Don't agonize over it.
You're not going to meet her.

263
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,440
I like Lee Hana much more than Son Yejin.

264
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,160
Son Yejin is like a goddess, really.

265
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,760
When I first saw Lee Hana,
I was astonished.

266
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,160
How can you be so pretty ?
And she also acts well.

267
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Hey, Lee Hana is not pretty at all.

268
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,160
I really like Lee Hana.

269
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,400
She's just attractive, nothing more.

270
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,840
Lee Hana was my neighbour
when I was in elementary school.

271
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,680
- Really ?
- Her father taught in the middle school.

272
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,320
It's already 21 past.

273
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,960
We should hurry.

274
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,920
We can't be late on the first day.

275
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Wow! Look at that player.

276
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,560
- What a cool uniform, man!
- Take a picture of that uniform!

277
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,440
Oh damn!

278
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,920
Compared to them, we look like
Sunday-afternoon shoppers.

279
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,960
Their Team uniform is so damn stylish!

280
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,640
And look at us.

281
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,800
Tae Yang... we can win this today.

282
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,680
Hi, thank you all for being at the opening
of the SK Planet StarCraft Proleague.

283
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,400
I am your game caster for today! Welcome!

284
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,120
No devices ?

285
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,920
Go and get them!
Go Jae Hoon! Go Sea !

286
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,880
Go out there and nail it!

287
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,840
Him, get him! That high-templar.

288
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,200
For the 8th Team, the short term goal
is making the sponsorship deal!

289
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,560
In that sense, Jae Dong has to do his job.
He is the highest-paid player, right ?

290
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,520
If they win today's match,
it might be possible.

291
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,680
Ok, stop what you are doing
and gather around for a minute.

292
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,000
Did you all receive the text message ?

293
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,400
We have to make a U-turn in the
second round and get better results.

294
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,720
That way we will have some leverage
to negotiate with sponsors.

295
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,400
Right now, if I try to contact sponsors,
we are stuck.

296
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,880
We have to show them something,
if we want to negotiate.

297
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,480
Telling them we will do better
in future is not enough.

298
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,240
Professionals show results first and then
make demands for what they have shown.

299
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,920
That's being a pro.

300
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,480
Do you understand ?

301
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,120
Where is the confidence, guys ?

302
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,800
I understand it wasn't easy.
It hasn't been easy.

303
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:52,120
Soon I'm going to graduate from
middle school and go to high school.

304
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,960
It's going to be hard to keep training,
because high school life is so busy.

305
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,280
We all have dreams, right ?

306
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,960
I wish we could have more time
searching for what we really want to do,

307
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,360
instead of staying in school that long.

308
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,000
He should think of it as a career
but he is doing it just for fun.

309
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,680
That is what you think.

310
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,160
I will tell you what I think.

311
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,360
He needs to control his mind
at all times,

312
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,760
but he doesn't.

313
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,000
People who study well play games well.
They are good at everything.

314
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,720
You started playing games
because you don't like to study.

315
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,040
That's not true!

316
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,840
Only people who are very smart
can play those games.

317
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,920
So I'm not smart ?

318
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,760
Your brain is not very good.

319
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,560
I once saw you gaming with your feet
on your desk. What was that all about ?

320
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,040
- When did I do that ?
- All the time.

321
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,480
How can I put my feet on my desk
and play ?

322
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,240
He sits like this.

323
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,040
I never do that when I game.

324
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,800
I was probably just chatting.

325
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,000
He has a wrong mind. Just wrong.

326
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,800
No, while I was chatting.

327
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,640
I said you are okay.

328
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,960
- That's what I mean.
- I know what you mean ...

329
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,400
- I'm on your side.
- You don't have to be on his side.

330
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,800
To be honest. It's right.

331
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Yes. When I'm playing a game,
I sit straight.

332
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,000
How could I put my foot on the desk
when I game ?

333
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,400
Attitude is not the point.
Tell us your plan.

334
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,960
- It's a simple one. Very basic.
- Basic or not, that's not the point.

335
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,960
Tell me what you are thinking, Yo Han.

336
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,200
- Like what ?
- Your plan for the future.

337
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,880
- Like what I'm going to do ?
- In the future.

338
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,240
Can you make it by April ?

339
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,520
Okay, I've thought about this.

340
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,360
I'm going to go to high school.

341
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,800
- In high school I will have to study.
- Right.

342
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,080
- You'll be bottom of the class.
- That is not the point, right now!

343
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,360
I will have to study, right Dad ?

344
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,000
Why do you even say that ?

345
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,400
So until February or March
I will keep doing my best to make it.

346
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,000
There will be a draft in April.
So until then, I should keep trying.

347
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,080
And then if I fail,
I will study seriously.

348
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,920
So if you fail you will give up ?

349
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,760
Can you really do that ?

350
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,200
- Seriously ?
- Really.

351
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,120
- I can barely believe you.
- Why not ?

352
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,680
- Are you sure ?
- Of course.

353
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,760
Giving up means you'll quit playing
games forever ?

354
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,600
Yes. I should study.

355
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,000
- Pinky swear ?
- All right.

356
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,880
- Seal it and copy.
- Alright, I get it.

357
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,720
Finish copying!

358
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,520
I think that is a wise decision.

359
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,080
I told you that if I fail, I'll study
to find another dream, right ?

360
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,440
I'm looking forward to that.

361
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,680
What was that dream again ?

362
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,720
- The one about the bank.
- That's right, the bank.

363
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,040
Are you going to be a teller
or the chief of the bank ?

364
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,000
Somewhere in the bank, I guess.

365
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,880
The security guard ?

366
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,440
What are you talking about ?

367
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,000
Today is a decisive day for the team.

368
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:51,560
If we win today, we could go to the
playoffs and make it to the finals.

369
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:59,760
If we lose today, the season is over
and that would be a disaster.

370
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,200
Okay, there are important moments
ahead of us.

371
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:13,360
In the next games, what are the 8th team
chances to make it to the postseason ?

372
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,640
Well, I don't think we can calculate that
in percentages.

373
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:26,000
We still have hope, so I believe
we can make it for sure.

374
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,760
And I really want to show you
what a miracle is.

375
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,720
Okay, just from watching that last match,
I believe that miracles can happen!

376
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Baby and I won the first two games.

377
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:50,600
Bridge and Baxter lost their games.
So it's a draw.

378
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,520
Sometimes the fate of an entire team is
in the hands of one single person.

379
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,000
Today, that person is Jae Hoon.

380
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,600
The game has started.
First, let's take a look at Kim Jae Hoon.

381
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,120
A two Gate rush.
Kim Jae Hoon has to scout this out fast.

382
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,080
The fate of his team's 1st season
is at stake.

383
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,360
Now, Kim Jae Hoon, he needs to be really
calm here. He can defend this.

384
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,280
Kim Jae Hoon Kim can't afford
to lose anything, not even a pylon.

385
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:28,120
They have to fight till the end. Kim Jae
Hoon Kim has more... he has a little more.

386
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,040
Kim Jae Hoon mustn't lose focus.
Shin Jae Wook needs to finish it here.

387
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,560
Ah, this has backfired.

388
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,280
But Kim Jae Hoon is short on minerals.
He can't make additional Zealots.

389
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,320
It looks like Shin Jae Wook will be
the man to give his team the victory.

390
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,680
Indeed. The main base has been dominated.
If the last Gateway is destroyed, it's over.

391
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,600
- The other is unpowered.
- Builds go round and round.

392
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,240
Whether you're a man or a woman...
these are the tears of a real man.

393
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,240
Especially on a big and important stage
like this..

394
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,160
We see how much this means to him,
especially as he is the team captain.

395
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,280
In such a situation,
I don't know what to say.

396
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,840
Guys, take your rubbish with you.

397
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,320
Today's defeat was not just down
to one person.

398
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,520
Individually, we are all outstanding
players.

399
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:25,360
But we lacked one thing and that's teamwork.
Today we failed as a team.

400
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,200
Do any of your friends ever call you ?

401
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,360
Your school friends or church friends ?

402
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,000
No, they don't.

403
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,920
So you are alone ?

404
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,880
Very sometimes they do.

405
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,160
The ones from your present high school ?

406
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,680
- Anyone from your middle school ?
- Some.

407
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,920
They really do ?

408
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:01,680
You know that the most important thing for
a pro gamer is his performance, right ?

409
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:08,720
Most pro gamers show good results in
the 2nd year after they joined the team.

410
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,520
You've now been with us
for a year and 3 months.

411
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,560
If I look at you objectively,

412
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,840
there hasn't been much change.

413
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,520
If you really want to be in the competition
and grow faster,

414
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,240
you have to invest everything
from your daily life into the game.

415
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:39,040
If you can do that, I believe you can be
the Ace of our team,

416
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,600
and make hundreds of millions a year.
Kim Joon Huyk as the symbol of Zerg!

417
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,080
That day can come in less than a year.

418
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,600
Make it happen, okay ?

419
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,440
Let's go practice now!

420
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,640
Losing the Proleague luckily didn't mean
the end of the 8th Team.

421
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:47,680
We are moving again,
to a bigger place but quite far away.

422
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,680
It's the first time for me
to be at Blizzcon.

423
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:58,280
It's also the first time that StarCraft I
is not an official tournament game.

424
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:06,160
It's all StarCraft II now. Some Korean
players have already made the transition.

425
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:11,240
Foreign teams are being established
and eSports tournaments pop up everywhere.

426
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:25,400
I knew StarCraft I was a dying breed,
but now it's official.

427
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:32,280
KeSPA has announced that this will be
the last season of StarCraft I.

428
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:38,880
I suppose you are all worried about the
future of Pro-Gamers. What will you do ?

429
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,080
Why is the future of Pro-Gaming so dark ?

430
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,000
You are the generation
facing the biggest crisis

431
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,440
but also with the most opportunities.

432
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:59,440
How's the StarCraft II training going ?
Is it going well, sleepy Baxter ?

433
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:06,600
We are being given a hard time now,
but you have to keep your courage up.

434
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,200
Change is good, they say. But a lot
of the team members are confused.

435
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,640
With the new game, everyone plays
from the same starting point.

436
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:23,280
Previous skills don't help you now
and that makes us all feel uncomfortable.

437
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,360
Lee Jae Dong, how old are you now ?

438
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,000
I'm 24 years old.

439
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,000
Twenty-four and already a great one.
But you are not young anymore.

440
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:39,440
In 5 years, when you are 30,
you should give advice to juniors.

441
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:45,000
You should then be a role model
that they will look up to.

442
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,480
Lee Jae Dong, his 4th victory has
collapsed by Lee Young Ho.

443
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,840
And after 2 times of failures
from the round of 16,

444
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:46,240
the 4th victory is the only thing
that is left for him to revive.

445
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,240
The E group of
On Game Net Star League Dual 2012.

446
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:00,800
When I was a child, my generation saw
Lee Jae Dong and others win the Star League.

447
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,720
It made us dream of becoming a pro gamer.

448
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:11,560
This is the last Star league with StarCraft
I. I have such good memories of it.

449
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,240
I wonder if it will be the same
for StarCraft II.

450
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,440
People say Lee Jae Dong is
not playing as well as before.

451
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,080
So I definitely worry about his future.

452
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,040
Those were the qualifiers. What does
Shin Dae Gun have to say ? Congratulations!

453
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,280
Thank you...

454
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,520
You really didn't want to go for the
consolation match. What happened ?

455
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,880
I gathered as much armed forces
as possible.

456
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:59,280
I needed to gather the armed forces
in order dominate.

457
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:07,680
I played calmly but Lee Jae Dong is good at
pressurizing. I thought I was going to lose.

458
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,280
So I stayed calm while playing.

459
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,320
- It's okay..
- Okay, I'm sorry..

460
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,520
Let's get going everyone.

461
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:55,000
- I don't know what to do now!
- Let's give the presents and go home.

462
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,040
- Thank you for your effort.
- Thank you.

463
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,200
- See you at the next league.
- Thank you so much.

464
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:14,080
Jae Dong always says to his fans
that he is all right.

465
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,640
But even if he says so,
we still worry about him.

466
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,400
Today is the last time I take part
in the Semi-Pro Tournament.

467
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,600
For weeks I practiced night and day.
I don't think I could do more.

468
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,120
I haven't given up my dream
of becoming a pro gamer yet.

469
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:03,160
But whatever happens today,
I can say I gave it my best shot.

470
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,720
I will have no regrets.

471
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,560
You weren't going to try anymore
should I defeat you again ?

472
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,400
- It's impossible to lose to you
- Why is that ?

473
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,480
I have one, but it is dirty.
I will fail if I wear that thing.

474
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,600
Mom ? We were almost late
so he had to go in straight away.

475
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,320
This is your last tournament, right ?
Good luck.

476
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,520
- So are you going to win ?
- Why not ?

477
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:39,360
What should I do ?
I'm facing Huang Jin Ha in the first round!

478
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,680
Wait, I'm going to warm my fingers up.

479
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,080
Hey brother, let's go to the bathroom.
I'm getting nervous.

480
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,680
Park Yo Han...number 214.

481
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,240
I'm screwed. I have to study now.

482
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,360
So you are going to be a bank clerk
and travel around the world ?

483
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:52,480
What about it ?
I want to travel around the world.

484
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,920
I almost died laughing...

485
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,720
Ah, I'm so pissed off.

486
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,880
Ah, so pissed off.

487
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,200
It's over.

488
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:51,080
The new Proleague season has started. The
first time we play StarCraft II in public.

489
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,600
Ever since I made my debut,
I kept on winning.

490
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,720
365 days a year I dashed on, non-stop.
No breaks.

491
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:12,560
This year was different. I started losing.
There was no special reason for it.

492
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:20,520
I was just personally cooled off. I lost
my passion. I felt like a cog in a machine.

493
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,160
Because I am a pro, a public figure,

494
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,600
people have expectations of me.

495
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,400
And sometimes that makes me feel
very tired.

496
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:56,360
But in fact, I feel that I am blessed.
I'm lucky to have the love of so many fans.

497
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,320
I am a man of great self-pride
and I really hate losing.

498
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,240
It's been ages since I tasted victory.

499
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,560
Now I want to rise again and hear people
shout: "That's Lee Jae Dong!

500
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,840
I really want to rise again.

501
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I owe it to my fans
and I owe it to myself.

502
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:10,120
That was the match that earned you
all this loud cheering.

503
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,720
I just feel very touched.

504
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,800
Touched by your own game!
Can you tell us what touched you so much ?

505
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:28,560
I just never knew winning a game
could feel so great.

506
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,200
- Were you surprised ?
- I really thought I was going to lose.

507
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,800
So did we!

508
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:41,360
Seeing you so touched by a single
victory reminds me

509
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,120
how important a victory
is for every player.

510
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:54,400
Now that you are so touched, maybe you could
speak to your fans from the heart ?

511
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,760
What do you have to say to them ?

512
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,400
Be confident!

513
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,240
Maybe he's too...

514
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,120
It must have been really hard
for you, Jae Dong.

515
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:22,240
To be the Ace of your team
and not make good results...

516
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:26,240
Oh, Jae Dong, I can't imagine
how tough that must be.

517
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,080
Hey you, what was the crying for ?

518
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,160
- Shit, that was awesome.
- Let's go for the third win.

519
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:08,400
Jae Dong, nail the interview!

520
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,800
When I was chasing my dream,
I practiced even on school days.

521
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,760
Now, I just hang out with my friends,
go to PC Bang with them or play pool.

522
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:44,920
For the last 2 to 3 years I didn't work
hard enough. I could have worked harder.

523
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,040
And I feel sorry for myself
that I didn't.

524
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,880
Pool or PC Bang ? Are you sure
you don't wanna go to PC Bang ?

525
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:29,240
I can do anything if I work hard. I can
always do better by working hard enough.

526
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,880
The effort is what counts.

527
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:38,240
If you still want to play and you are
not good enough, play it as a hobby.

528
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,160
At least, that's my experience.

529
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:48,120
You think you are good,
but if you go out there,

530
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,880
there are always better players.

531
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:56,560
I suggest you start being serious once
you are certain about how good you are.

532
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,760
StarCraft and football are the same.

533
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,160
It's great when you win
and it's upsetting when you lose.

534
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:35,240
People with a strong sense of rivalry
always want to win and I'm one of them.

535
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:44,560
But you can't win all the time.
Losing is just part of the journey.

536
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,640
I know now that it takes patience
and hard work to reach the top.

537
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:12,760
Even if I didn't get to play a single game
this year, the other players accept me.

538
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:19,480
Many gamers who joined the team after me
have given up and left the house.

539
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,120
But I wanted to show I have as much
endurance as the senior players.

540
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,960
For the first time,
I feel that I am where I belong.

541
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,800
Since I was young,
I thought I should hide my emotions.

542
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,520
I shouldn't show any weakness,
I'd been taught.

543
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,040
That's how a Korean man should act.

544
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,200
So every time I walked onto the stage,
I put on my game face.

545
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,880
The other day was different.
I didn't think about it. It just happened.

546
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:16,880
When it did, I felt a very positive vibe
going through the room.

547
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:22,840
People seemed happy to see a part of me
they normally wouldn't.

548
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:27,440
Even if some teased me about it afterwards.

549
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,480
Winning the game the other day felt good.

550
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,600
But what I'm feeling now,

551
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,120
that's the real victory.
