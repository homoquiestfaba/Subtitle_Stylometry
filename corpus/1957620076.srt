1
00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:03,345
(serene music)

2
00:00:21,726 --> 00:00:24,893
- Oh God, get me through this weekend,

3
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:29,789
and I'll give, a day's
pay to the poor orphans.

4
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,140
(pleasant music)

5
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:45,680
(telephone buzzing)

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,693
- [Man] Jeffrey Spencer.

7
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:47,791
- Sweety.
- Hi.

8
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,045
- [Woman] I have great news.

9
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:50,381
They're flying me in on Thursday

10
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:52,402
for the interview, first class.

11
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:53,987
- [Jeffrey] A power commuter, huh?

12
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,032
- [Woman] Yes, we are
going to take Manhattan.

13
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,686
- [Jeffrey] We are gonna
take over the world!

14
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:58,699
(woman chuckling)
So we're gonna have

15
00:00:58,699 --> 00:00:59,889
a three-day weekend!

16
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,292
- Yeah.
- Do you have the stamina?

17
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:05,375
- [Woman] You'll see (chuckles).

18
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,686
So do you think marriage will
put a dent in our sex life?

19
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:15,901
- [Jeffrey] I sure hope so,

20
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,076
(woman chuckles)
then maybe I can get some work

21
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,064
done, which is what I have to do now.

22
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:20,732
- [Woman] So hang up, it's your turn.

23
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,360
- [Jeffrey] Nu-uh, it's your turn.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,406
- [Woman] All right, together.

25
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,517
- [Both] One, two,

26
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,798
- [Jeffrey] Two and a half...
(woman chuckling)

27
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:29,368
Two and three-quarters...

28
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:32,141
- [Woman] (sighs) Oh Jeff I love you!

29
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,891
(pleasant music)

30
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:42,905
Christmas is too hectic, what
about a Thanksgiving wedding?

31
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:43,738
- [Jeffrey] Great!

32
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,683
Wait, can't, I have to be in Hong Kong for

33
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:47,170
a two-week shoot, you wanna come?

34
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,541
- [Woman] Can't, I'm in
a law school, remember?

35
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,374
- [Jeffrey] How much longer?

36
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:51,393
Soon you'll be here.

37
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:53,175
- [Woman] I can't wait.

38
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,925
(pleasant music)

39
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,548
(car horn honking)

40
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:15,131
(hectic music)

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,017
(beeping)

42
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:44,568
(beeping)

43
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,025
- Did you remember to pack
something nice for the party?

44
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:50,858
- Oh yeah.

45
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:53,525
Hey hey hey, what's this?

46
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:56,267
No computer, no cell phone.

47
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,646
- Oh well, no lucky shirt.

48
00:02:58,646 --> 00:02:59,709
- Yes lucky shirt!
- Ah ah ah ah ah!

49
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,066
Yes computer (laughs)!
- No computer.

50
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,771
This is our getaway weekend.

51
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:07,366
Did you forget?
- Oh...

52
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,157
(lips smacking)
No.

53
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:10,324
Of course not.

54
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,178
(groaning)

55
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,448
(footsteps echoing)
But you know how it is

56
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:16,679
at my mothers.

57
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,006
- [Jeffrey] Yeah, it's great.

58
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:19,339
- For you maybe.

59
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:22,883
(sighs) Maybe I'll be sucked up

60
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,891
by the great family swamp.

61
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,601
(squealing)
(clattering)

62
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:29,827
- [Jeffrey] You all right?

63
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,660
- Yes.

64
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:34,047
Can we store some of this stuff at Mom's?

65
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,913
- Wow...
- How much of it can we

66
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:35,850
cram into the trunk?

67
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,683
- Uh...
(alarm beeping)

68
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,652
- Oh shit!

69
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,780
I'm gonna be late, um, do what you can.

70
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,282
Oh, don't forget Grandpa's presents!

71
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:42,139
- Oh what'd we get him?

72
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,602
- A clock radio, a cordless razor

73
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,904
and an electronic personal organizer.

74
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:49,152
- Just what every octogenarian needs.

75
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:51,009
(telephone beeping)
- Hey Laura, Ben's in.

76
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,222
- In where?
- Your office.

77
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:53,259
- Thanks Robin.

78
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:54,662
Good morning Ben.

79
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:57,113
- I wasted the whole night
looking up precedents

80
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,332
and the potential violations

81
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,071
in that shareholder's agreement.

82
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,056
Couldn't find a thing.

83
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:03,734
No, now Clifton is gonna grill me on this!

84
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:04,567
- That,
- I'm sure!

85
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,379
- is not the issue.
- What?

86
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,057
- It's about transfer restrictions.

87
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:10,761
- No it can't be that easy.
- Uh huh.

88
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,808
(keyboard clacking)

89
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:15,341
(computer beeping)

90
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:19,151
There are no transfer restrictions
in violation of the UCC.

91
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:23,109
Read it yourself, it's clear,
it's simple, it's the law.

92
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:24,879
Isn't that comforting?

93
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,709
(chattering)
(bell ringing)

94
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,954
- [Set Manager] Quiet on the set!

95
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:29,415
- Okay okay, it's ready, let's go.

96
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,344
- This is a rehearsal, and action!

97
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,589
(coughing)
- Sh!

98
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,756
(beeping)

99
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:39,823
- Cue the dog.
- Action, dog!

100
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,738
(dog barking)

101
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:45,535
(dog sneezing)

102
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,295
- (sighs) Christ almighty.

103
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:48,784
- Cut!
- Not another allergic dog.

104
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:50,157
Can you believe this?

105
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,347
Jerry?
(bell ringing)

106
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:53,233
What's wrong with this one?

107
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,066
- Wrong?

108
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:54,953
This stuff is poison.

109
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:56,914
- That's the point, it's
week killer, get it?

110
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:58,735
- Yeah well it's making my dog sick.

111
00:04:58,735 --> 00:04:59,568
(snuffly barking)
- Getting a little

112
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,036
noisy around here.

113
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:02,577
(sneezy barking)

114
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,354
- [Woman] Where's lunch?

115
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,036
- Send in the backup dog.

116
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:06,869
- [Director] Call this set!

117
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,261
- Look I got to get out of here.

118
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,094
- Where you going?

119
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,106
- Well Stan I'll tell 'ya,

120
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:11,659
first it was flammable baby clothes,

121
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,167
then it was carcinogenic face powders.

122
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,932
- Jeff, they're clients,

123
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,406
big accounts.
- Now it's a lawn product

124
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:17,512
that kills pets?

125
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:20,273
- What do you want, a
location shoot, Fiji, Paris?

126
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:21,185
Some perfume commercial?

127
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:22,883
You could take your wife.

128
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:24,353
You could take the model!

129
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:25,276
- Oh man!

130
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,762
- Wha-wha-wha-what is it, do
you want a raise, is that it?

131
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,836
- No Stan I just want a product
that doesn't kill people.

132
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,767
(doors clattering)

133
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,137
- [Laura] We're going to my mothers.

134
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:35,180
- You're gonna jump-start the sex

135
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,401
at your mother's?
- Sh!

136
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,585
(chuckling)
- How long has it been?

137
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,820
- Six weeks now, if it
was any of your business!

138
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,548
- I thought you hadn't
been there in months!

139
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:45,121
Oh, you mean six weeks without sex!

140
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:46,694
God no wonder you're so tense.

141
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,902
By the way, Clifton called
a senior partners meeting,

142
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:52,569
by tonight you could be partner.

143
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,256
- That's why I'm so tense.

144
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,390
(sighing)

145
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,223
- [Man] Look who's here.

146
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:07,900
- (chuckles) Pay up!

147
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,001
Come on!
- Jordan was off last night.

148
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:13,177
- Yes he was, (mumbles), fools.

149
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,656
- Sure you don't want to
let it ride until next week?

150
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:16,643
- Absolutely not, and
you guys should never

151
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,666
bet against the home team.

152
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,987
- Good morning everyone.

153
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,904
Take your seats please.

154
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:28,028
Eric.

155
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,057
Eric, what's happening
with the Smithum matter?

156
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,186
- I'm meeting with Smithum
senior this afternoon

157
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,523
to discuss the restructuring
of their offshore entity.

158
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,025
- Senior?

159
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:42,488
Eric, I told you Smithum
junior, not Smithum senior.

160
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:43,684
- What junior?

161
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:44,517
I, I, I...

162
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,519
- Will you see me later please?

163
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,321
(clapping)
Now, we have a new client.

164
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:55,911
Important, very important,
but very demanding.

165
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,217
Who's up?

166
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,693
- Give it to Laura, Clifton,
she's good with women.

167
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:04,433
- You're assuming that
demanding means it's a woman?

168
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:06,933
Clifton I will take that case.

169
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:12,613
- Robin, get the rest
of Mr. Dhalberg's file,

170
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:14,578
- Yes sir.
- and give it to Laura.

171
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:17,403
I'm sure she'll want to
review it over the weekend.

172
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,106
Now we have a meeting
first thing Monday morning,

173
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,927
prepare for an October 10th court date.

174
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:23,162
- Don't we have something
else on October 10th sir?

175
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:26,154
- Well that may be, now you have this.

176
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:26,987
- Okay.

177
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:35,124
(unexpectedly perky music)

178
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,226
- Fucking banner.

179
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,295
- There was a young fellow name Arius,

180
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,851
whose approaches to
sex were quite various,

181
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:47,312
he'd screw anything from princess to king,

182
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:50,462
and the results were invariably hilarious.

183
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,902

Martha!
- Grandpa.

193
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,222
Damn, I forgot to give him his medication.

194
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,055
- [Grandpa] Martha!

195
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,552
- She's in the wood's Jack!

196
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,303
- [Woman] Why do you do that?

197
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:15,227
- Well she is, just six feet under.

198
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,616
- That's so mean!

199
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:17,679
- Meaner than breaking the news

200
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,415
10 times a day that his wife died?

201
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:22,109
People have a right to their fantasies.

202
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:25,109
(telephone ringing)

203
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:28,037
Julia Hartley.

204
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,299
- Julia, darling.

205
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:31,086
- [Julia] Yago, are you
coming to Dad's party?

206
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,994
- I wouldn't miss it for
anything in the world.

207
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,921
Now listen, you're Microsoft commission is

208
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:38,340
for a statue at National,
not Manhattan headquarters.

209
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,488
- [Julia] That's even better,
ask for double the money.

210
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:42,712
- Why I thought I'd bring
the big Microsoft honcho

211
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:45,407
to the party, where I'll
put the squeeze on then.

212
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:46,454
- [Julia] You're a genius!

213
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:48,537
- See you tomorrow, ciao.

214
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,238
- Got me an incredible commission.

215
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:59,004
- That's great, Mom,
don't make my butt so big.

216
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,657
- I love a big butt.

217
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,386
Hush.
- When are they coming?

218
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:03,646
- Sometime between five and midnight,

219
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:05,355
you know your sisters.

220
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,732
They're worse than the cable people.

221
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:08,705
- This one's fast as
(telephone ringing)

222
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,519
lightning.
- Great!

223
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,946
- This one's slow.
(telephone ringing)

224
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:14,029
And this one,

225
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:20,419
is a little something I picked
up for your love weekend!

226
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:21,832
- Oh my god!

227
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:23,229
Put that away!
- Well call me crazy

228
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,372
but I don't think you have one of these.

229
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:29,025
What, no thank you for
saving my marriage Robin?

230
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:33,402
- This is a great place
to hide my computer.

231
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:36,569
Thank you Robin, for saving my career.

232
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:43,690
- [Woman] (grunts)
You're driving me crazy!

233
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,423
What's wrong with the song?

234
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:47,799
- It's no good Diane.
- All you do is criticize!

235
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,301
You son-of-a-bitch, get out of my life!

236
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:51,954
Oh this time it's really over!

237
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:52,787
- Really over huh?

238
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:54,671
What were the last 10 times, rehearsals?

239
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:56,634
- You see, I can't take that sarcasm!

240
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,581
- This is my thanks for
getting you a booking.

241
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:01,058
- Oh in Poughkeepsie for
Christ sake, in a diner!

242
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,446
- You know what, it's work!

243
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,859
Anyway it wasn't a diner,
they had table clothes.

244
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,191
(water splashing)

245
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,024
- Asshole!

246
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:11,119
- If you'd quit pissing away your talent,

247
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:15,662
and write serious songs, you
could get any gig you wanted.

248
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:16,841
- Ron, I'm sorry!

249
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:18,597
Go get a dry shirt.

250
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,075
You can't walk out all wet, you'll

251
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:22,396
get pneumonia.
- Watch me.

252
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,525
- Look, can't we do this on Monday?

253
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:27,873
I want you to come to
Grandpa's party with me!

254
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,345
Ron!

- Oh, it'll get better.

274
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,473
I wrote it for your benefit.

275
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,469
- You're writing songs
for my husband's benefit?

276
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,191
- [Diane] Yeah it's for the
Hudson River Trust fundraiser.

277
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:24,024
- Oh yeah.
- Now remember,

278

00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:32,919
- Thank you Diane.

283
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,399
- What is the date of that again?

- Oh god, look at that smog.

288
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:45,157

you're not from there.

want to say hi to Todd.

298
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:21,969

299
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:23,397
Jeff down!

300
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:24,463
Hurry up!
- This'll just take a minute!

301
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:25,586
- We're already late!

302
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,794
I hate being late.

303
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,184

it's five o'clock on Friday afternoon,

305
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,434
the weekend has begun.

00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:32,288
Jeff wait!

307
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:33,980
- Come on!
(Diane squealing)

308
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,563
- So has the partner's meeting.

309
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,927
- Todd!

310
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:41,879
(giggling)

311
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,046
- Hey hey hey!

312
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,328
- Tah-dah!
- Ah the invitations

313
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:46,161
for the benefit!

314
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,598
- Yeah what do you think,
I sprang for color?

315
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:48,825
It really pops, huh?

316
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:50,500
- Perfect, what do we owe you?

317
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,891
- Like I said it's my donation.

318
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:52,993
- Did you listen to my tape?

319
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,657
- Yeah, you're song is cute.

320
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,643
- Cute!
- Is that Ron on guitar?

321
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,258
The guy is amazing.

322
00:12:58,258 --> 00:12:59,897
He's gonna play the benefit too, right?

323
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,808
- Call him and ask him.

324
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:02,914
- Uh oh.

325
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:03,876
Trouble in paradise?

326
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:06,152
- Oh please, she's got
a new guy in the car.

327
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,998
- What's he play?

328
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:08,902
(giggling)

329
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:10,142
- You've got to come to my grandfather's

330
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:11,225
birthday party tomorrow!

331
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,913
- I can't, I have house guests.

332
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:14,473
- So bring them.

333
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:17,081
- Listen, guys, I have news.

334
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,731
The Sierra Club has offered
me a really big job.

335
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:20,912
It's too good to pass up.

336
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:21,805
- [Diane] That's great!

337
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:25,982
- Oh no, no no no you
can't walk out on us now!

338
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:27,877
No the river's just getting clean again!

339
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:29,782
This is one of the most
glorious spots on the planet,

340
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:32,178
you can't just let 'em come
and muck it up all over again!

341
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,003
Gee Todd you know the river!

342
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,905
You know the players,
you know the wildlife!

343
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,008
- The fish need you!
(telephone ringing)

344
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:40,139
- They need someone, it
doesn't have to be me!

345
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,234
(telephone ringing)

346
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:44,817
(serene music)

347
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:47,933
- Oh no.

348
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,183
There they are.

349
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,482
(lethargic music)

350
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:05,699
- Time to eat Goliath!
(car horn honking)

351
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:12,658
- Oh, great house!

352
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,303
- Come on I'll show you
where I lost my virginity.

353
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:16,553
(shouting)

354
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,640
- Martha?

355
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,473
Martha!

356
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:25,602
- Grandpa it's Laura!

357
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:27,681
It's Laura!
- Oh oh oh!

358
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,155
- Happy birthday!
- Yeah, yeah thank you.

359
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:31,874
- Sorry but it bothers
me when he does that.

360
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:33,892
- Just go with it.

361
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:35,143
Hey Grandpa how you doing?

362
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:35,976
It's Jeff!
- Oh good, good!

363
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,811
- Good to see 'ya!
- Jeff, yeah.

364
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:38,767
- Ooh!

365
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:39,727
Grandpa?
- What?

366
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:40,691
- Will you carry this in for me?

367
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,273
- Oh sure.
- Thank you.

368
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:46,606
- What's that thing made of, chain-mail?

369
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,555
Can't wait!

370
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,546
Hey!
- Jeff!

371
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,743
- Teddy my man!

372
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,384
- Hi!
- How was your dad's wedding?

373
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:54,846
- Sucked big time.

374
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:55,909
Even made me dance.

375
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,582
- Uh, that does suck.

376
00:14:57,582 --> 00:14:59,692
- Yeah, but I-I-I-I got
this great ecosystem

377
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:00,525
I want to show you!

378
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,628
- Oh yeah, where is it?

379
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:02,551
- Down by the river!

380
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:03,912
- Well I think we better take a look.

381
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:05,763
Hey Grandpa, can we take Winnie for a run?

382
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,165
- Oh yeah!

383
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,127
Go on Winnie!

384
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:09,070
- [Jeff] Come on girl!

385
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,324
Hey, slow down!

386
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:11,559
(dog barking)

387
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,882
- Welcome, welcome!

388
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:13,715
- [Laura] Hi Mom!

389
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:14,984
- How is my almost partner?

390
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:17,278
- Please, I'm not the
only one in the running.

391
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:18,381
- Aw you'll get it.

392
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,514
- Mom, don't start!

393
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:20,611
- Mom!

394
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:21,842
(giggling)
- Mmm!

395
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:22,675
My baby!

396
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,047
What's this one's name?

397
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:26,380
- Mom, meet Bud.

398
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:28,329
- How do you do Bud?

399
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,162
- Hi!
- Lesley!

400
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,544
- Hello stranger!

401
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:31,617
- [Laura] Oh it's good to see you.

402
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:34,596
- [Diane] I hope you like
him, he's a present for you.

403
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:35,801
- Oh what do I do with him?

404
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,306
- He's a plumber, Mom.

405
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:39,251
(Bud chuckling)
- Ah.

406
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:41,547
I'll put the cot in Theodore's room.

407
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:42,914
- Who is she kidding?

408
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:45,331
- Actually this one's a hunk.

409
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,085
- Don't touch it, 'cause otherwise

410
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:50,466
the mother won't come back.

411
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,020
- Okay.

412
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,267
Where do you suppose he
fell from, out of there?

413
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,100
- Yeah.

414
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:01,049
- God it's so beautiful here.

415
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,342
- [Lesley] They sell laptops
at Victoria's Secret?

416
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:16,971
- Oh uh, Teddy's not gonna
tell Jeff I'm opening

417
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,954
a branch office in his room is he?

418
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:20,484
- Teddy's good at keeping secrets.

419
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:21,857
- Good.

420
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,621
Teddy's a terrific kid Les.

421
00:16:23,621 --> 00:16:25,091
- Yeah, I'm worried about him.

422
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:25,924
He just came back from

423
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:27,007
visiting his father
- I'm indisposed,

424
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,145
- and he's been acting weird.
- you know what to do.

425
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:30,746
(voicemail beeping)
- Robin, did I make partner?

426
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:33,697
Where are you, um, I want
to know what happened

427
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:36,447
at the meeting, call me a.s.a.p..

428
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,840
- [Lesley] I take it the heat is on.

429
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,423
- Ugh, let's not talk about it.

430
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,394
If you're having problems with Teddy

431
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,350
why don't you just send
him to us one weekend?

432
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,404
- I got a better idea.

433
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:48,765
How about you come up and take care

434
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,033
of Teddy and Grandpa and I
go there for the weekend?

435
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,297
- It's a deal!
(chuckling)

436
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,712
You burnt?
- You know I run this

437
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:57,062
whole operation with Mom
as artist in residence.

438
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:58,816
(bell ringing)
Oh, that's the meat loaf.

439
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,528
(laughing)

440
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:01,915
- What a bunch of mixed up kids.

441
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,794
- [Teddy] Yeah.

442
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:04,631
- Hey!

443
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,661
- Hey what are you guys doing in my room?

444
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:06,852
- Oh, I'm leaving, I'm leaving!

445
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:08,190
(laughing)
Goodbye!

446
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,440
- [Laura] I'll be down in a minute Les.

447
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,773
- [Lesley] Okay.

448
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:13,918
- What's this?

449
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:14,751
- Um,

450
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:18,066
force of habit?

451
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:20,002
- What's this?

452
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,752
- Um, Jeff I'm sorry.

453
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,325
Clifton dumped a new client
on me at the last minute.

454
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,395
What was I supposed to do?

455
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,478
- You could have said no!

456
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,375
- I'm, did, did I do something wrong?

457
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,292
- No Teddy.

458
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,291
- Yum, I'm starving.

459
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,985
(chattering)

460
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:48,061
- May I have my phone?

461
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,871
I'm expecting a call from Robin.

462
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:51,685
- Or Clifton, or Ben.

463
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:52,685
- Thank you.

464
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,834
- Okay gang, Mom wants
to change the plates.

465
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:57,874
- (sighs) Why?
- We've already started.

466
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,023
- I know, don't put back.

467
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:02,118
- (laughs) Oh my god,
this is so unnecessary.

468
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:03,922
(clattering)
- Why is every minute

469
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:05,718
chaos in this house?

470
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,551
Thank you.

471
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:09,592
- Thank you honey.
- Go to bed!

472
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:10,936
- Humph, what?

473
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,273
I have to take the meat loaf out.

474
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:14,972
- It's all taken care of Drena.

475
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:16,688
- Goodnight Drena!
- Goodnight Drena!

476
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:18,081
- [Drena] Goodnight everybody!

477
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:20,104
- This is an event!

478
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:23,858
It may be our last family dinner here.

479
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:26,120
I've put the house on the market.

480
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,176
- What?

481
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,639
Without consulting us?

482
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,983
- How could you Mom, this is our home?

483
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,594
- I didn't think anybody would care!

484
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,260
Jeff's the only one who's ever here.

485
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,700
- Uh, what am I, chopped liver?

486
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,024
- I slept with the Grand Duke of Dart,

487
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:43,107
beef Wellington, beans, a prune tart.

488
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,809
- What about Grandpa?

489
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,165
- He goes with the house.

490
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:48,145
- Mom!

491
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:50,640
- His grumblings abdominal,

492
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,251
- He's coming with me.

493
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:54,762
- Were simply abominable,

494
00:18:54,762 --> 00:18:57,180
till finally he passed a big--

495
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,710
- Dad, please!

496
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,012
(flatulating loudly)
(laughing)

497
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:04,110
I thought everybody would
be happy, change is good!

498
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,482
Otherwise you get in ruts.

499
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,021
- I agree.

500
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,067
But you haven't told us Julia,

501
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,883
where are you planning to move?

502
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,950
- Soho.

503
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,892
- [All] Soho?

504
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:15,145
- You'll be surrounded by
artists, I think that's great!

505
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,031
- No it's not that simple Jeff!

506
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,518
Our lives will be uprooted!

507
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:19,672
- Yeah but Julia should have the freedom

508
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:22,327
to go where she wants, don't you think?

509
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,230
- I don't believe you!

510
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,897
You used to always take my side.

511
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:31,116
- Look, Grandpa.

512
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,722
I almost forgot.

513
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,285
Happy birthday.

514
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:36,524
- [Julia] I got him the same thing.

515
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:38,441
- Bubble wrap.
- Me too!

516
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:41,036
- He's becoming one of them.

517
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:44,199
(bubble wrap popping)

518
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,201
- [Lesley] Mm, this pie is great.

519
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,815
I really pigged out.

520
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:49,679
(chuckling)
Someone stop me.

521
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,407
I shouldn't be doing this.

522
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,414
- Lesley did you get a Miracle Bra?

523
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:55,164
- No, a miracle baby.

524
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,890
- A miracle baby what do you mean?

525
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,640
- I'm pregnant Laura!

526
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:02,115
- Oh my god!

527
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:04,697
(laughing)
Oh my, on purpose?

528
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:08,871
- Uh well, uh, Teddy knows
and Mom knows, that's it.

529
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,493
- So who's the father?

530
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,493
- Mm, it's a long story.

531
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,798
- I got time!

532
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,942
Lesley, get back in here!

533
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,320
(laughing)

534
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,500
- Okay, someone I know, very well,

535
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,275
and Teddy is really happy and so am I,

536
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,693
I've always wanted more kids.

537
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,687
- When's the wedding?

538
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:27,770
- Well, um...

539
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:31,068
- He's married?

540
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:33,170
- Let's just say the official story

541
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,192
is artificial insemination.

542
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,617
- Give me a break!

543
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:41,934
- Nobody wants to believe
it, that's their problem.

544
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:44,798
- I must have been adopted.

545
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,965
- I'll never forget, the night
my husband left for good.

546
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,898
Watching his tail lights disappear,

547
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:57,765
like a shooting star on a summer night.

548
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,924
I raised these kids with no support

549
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:03,525
of any kind from their father.

550
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:06,269
- Well that must have been tough ma'am.

551
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,884
- He died mum.

552
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:09,059
- But that was later.

553
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,828
Heart attack.

554
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:13,613
I ran this old house, single-handedly.

555
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,059
- Maybe a hundred years ago.

556
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,223
- [Julia] Squirrels in
the chimney one day,

557
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:18,875
broken pipes the next.

558
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,981
- Well you got a great house here ma'am,

559
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,940
you just, you need a handyman.
(dishwasher banging)

560
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,690
- No Ma, the dishwasher's broken.

561
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:30,034
- I uh, can take a look at it.

562
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:31,034
- Oh, great!

563
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,220
You're hired.

564
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:35,981
- Do you like ooze or is that too strong?

565
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:38,810
- Well why, well uh, abuse?

566
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,328
Abuse.
- Abuse, misuse?

567
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:42,803
Misuse!
- I like ooze, it's an image,

568
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:43,825
I think it's stronger.

569
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:44,839
- [Diane] Okay I'll go with ooze.

570
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,936
I think it's funny too.

571
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:48,864
- What are you guys doing?

572
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:51,084
- Oh we're just working on
the song for the benefit.

573
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,653
We're fine.

574
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:53,486
- Okay.

575
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:58,546
(thumping)

576
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,152
- Okay I'm gonna write some more verses.

577
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:09,330
- [Robin] I'm indisposed,
you know what to do.

578
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,529
- Robin, Laura, call me back!

579
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:15,696
Fax me, email me, anything,
please I'm dying here!

580
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:30,121
(crickets chirping)

581
00:22:33,196 --> 00:22:34,029
- Martha!

582
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:36,636
My little mouse!

583
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:38,318
(cheerful piano music)

584
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:41,859
- I found the song that
grandpa used to sing to us.

585
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:46,026
♫ Put your arms around
me honey, hold me tight

586
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:52,950
♫ Close me up inside your
arms, all through the night

587
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:59,781
♫ Here, near, the one that I adore

588
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:06,502
♫ It's clear what the night is for

589
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:13,168
♫ Let the world go by
and never slow its pace

590
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:16,706
♫ I've found all

591
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:18,658
- You gonna tuck me in too?
♫ I need inside

592
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:21,741
♫ Your sweet embrace

593
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:25,972
♫ Oh, oh I never knew

594
00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:32,056
♫ Anyone like you

595
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:39,544
(pleasant music)

596
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:52,612
- Laura?

597
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:55,954
Laura?

598
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:16,922
- [Diane] Oh yeah do it harder

599
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,339
Oh yeah, come on.

600
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:26,219
Oh, oh yeah!
(groaning)

601
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:31,468
- [Bud] Here we go!

602
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,439
(panting)

603
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,439
- Oh, oh god, I'm dying!

604
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:38,287
Oh, oh...

605
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,120
- Shit.

606
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:41,295
- [Bud] Like that?

607
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:43,268
Here we go.
- Oh!

608
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:46,018
(pleasant music)

609
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:53,995
(dramatic music)

610
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:59,489
(languid music)

611
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:02,666
(maudlin music)

612
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,999
- Darling, I'm going to die.

613
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:12,272
(coughing)
Let me die!

614
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:13,105
- Kath!

615
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:17,903
- Take me in your arms, hold me tight!

616
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:19,491
Don't let me go!

617
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:20,737
- Kath!

618
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:22,916
- [Kath] It's dark out there alone.

619
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,572
- Hey Jeff what are you doing up so late?

620
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:26,784
- Huh?
- Mind if I join you?

621
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,951
I can't sleep.

622
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,503
- Me neither.

623
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,190
- [Darling] Really not since we met.

624
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,869
- [Kath] Not since we met.

625
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,952
- In life, and in death, say it Kath!

626
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:44,659
- In life, and in death,
we'll never be parted.

627
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:50,389
- [Darling] You do believe that,

628
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:52,312
don't you Kathy?
(sniffing)

629
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:55,062
(dramatic music)

630
00:25:58,738 --> 00:26:01,140
(sighing)

631
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,773
- Life sucks, and then you die.

632
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:05,440
- That's depressing.

633
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,551
- I hate my job.

634
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:13,530
- So quit.
- Oh it's not that easy,

635
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:18,054
I, I have a mortgage and,
I want a simpler life.

636
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,299
I can't stop thinking about Todd's job.

637
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:22,570
- Aw, that'd be great for you.

638
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,283
You'd get to be on the river all the time.

639
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,563
Oh, shit.

640
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:27,958
- Right you see the problem.

641
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,208
I'd be up here.

642
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:32,829
It's not the life Laura signed on for.

643
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,247
(sniffing)
- Well what does she say?

644
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:37,664
- Oh god, I haven't told her.

645
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,283
Not that Laura even knows I'm alive.

646
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:52,970
Yeah, get this, I have to make
an appointment to have sex!

647
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,830
(giggling)
For Christ sake.

648
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,379
- No!
- Can you believe that?

649
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:56,306
- Well that could work.

650
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:57,706
- No it doesn't, she cancels.

651
00:26:57,706 --> 00:26:59,601
(laughing)
Oh god this is terrible,

652
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,712
I shouldn't be telling you any of this.

653
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:03,042
A dog.

654
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,303
But it's frustrating, you know I play

655
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:06,406
second fiddle to a cordless phone!

656
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:09,641
- Hey you know that would
make a really great song.

657
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:12,724
- Then, if I tell her, I'll lose her.

658
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,016
- That is so heavy.

659
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,157
♫ If I'm being myself means losing you

660
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,395
(faint singing)

661
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:34,185
♫ Even when you're home I still feel alone

662
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:38,623
♫ I'm playing second fiddle

663
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,040
♫ To your cordless phone

664
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:45,490
- God, that's it exactly.

665
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,851
Who wrote that, Willy?

666
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,196
Guy's a genius.

667
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,279
- No, we did!

668
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:53,851
Oh!

669
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:55,518
Thanks for the song!

670
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,450
(giggling)

671
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:01,576
Talk to Laura!

672
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:08,649
(serene music)

673
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:14,355
- God, get me through this day

674
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:18,522
and I'll give the poor
orphans a whole week's pay.

675
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,483
- Alvin, dig the pit where
Grandpa always had it.

676
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:32,648
(bell clanging)

677
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:12,758
(perky music)

678
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:57,304
- How 'bout a quickie
before breakfast Martha?

679
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:01,785
(laughing)

680
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:02,966
- [Diane] This water is freezing!

681
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:05,883
- [Lesley] You guys, are so chicken.

682
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:08,123
(laughing)

683
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:10,375
- Laura, um, I gotta go to work today,

684
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,395
can you make your
special cake for Grandpa?

685
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,091
- Laura doesn't have time to bake anymore.

686
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:15,470
Diane can make the cake.

687
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,032
- Oh sure I'll make the cake.

688
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:19,262
Laura and Jeff could use
some time together anyhow.

689
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:23,484
- Get a move on girls we've
got a lot to do for the party.

690
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:26,393
- Since when are you such an
expert on what Jeff and I need?

691
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:27,226
- What did I do?

692
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,184
All I said was that you and Jeff

693
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,063
could use some time together.

694
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:31,396
You're so tense!

695
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:04,191
- Hi.

696
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:07,822
- Hi.

697
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,853
Mmm.

698
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:19,199
You uh,

699
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,157
you smell like grass.

700
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,408
And leaves.

701
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:27,571
(chuckling)
Kind of a,

702
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,904
cinnamony overtones, it's kind of nice.

703
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,382
- Do you still love me?

704
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:35,861
(tense music)

705
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,437
- Of course I love you.

706
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:39,650
What do you mean still?

707
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,317
- More than anybody?

708
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,200
- Yes.

709
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:47,500
More than anybody.

710
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,250
(romantic music)

711
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:05,451

(telephone beeping)

714
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,680
- I can't.
- They'll call back.

715
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,239
- Laura Spencer.
- I give up.

716
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,606
- [Robin] Hi Laura, I have bad news.

717
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:21,211
You didn't make partner, I'm so sorry.

718
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:22,657
- Did anybody?

719
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:23,912
- [Robin] Who do you know, whose uncle is

720
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,751
Secretary of State and who can bring in

721
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:28,078
20 zillion bucks worth of business?

722
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:29,661
- Eric.
- Yes, Eric.

723
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:32,732
- What did they say,
was there a discussion?

724
00:32:32,732 --> 00:32:35,199
- [Robin] Yeah, everybody
knows how good you are.

725
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:39,508
They're such jerks, I can't
believe this happened.

726
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:40,813
- Thank you for calling Robin,

727
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:43,043
I'll see you at work on Monday.

728
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:45,793
(downbeat music)

729
00:32:52,485 --> 00:32:53,972
- Mom sent me for chairs.

730
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,580
Are these ready.
- Yeah.

731
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,490
Where's the plumber?

732
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,486
- Where's the wife?

733
00:32:57,486 --> 00:32:58,650
(sighing)
- Did you talk to her?

734
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,913
How did it go?
- How'd it go?

735
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,712
It went the way it always goes, you know.

736
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:04,075
Computer on the bed and the
phone call from the office,

737
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:07,373
and the usual marriage interruptus.

738
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:08,872
- I'm sorry.

739
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,211
- You want to come fishing with me?

740
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,411
- Jeff, don't go there.

741
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:13,244

Steven that was not meant for you.

757
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,396
- Hi Dad, yeah we have practice today.

758
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:11,813
No, we'll be playing the Bears next week.

759
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,486
No, not yet.

760
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,718

761
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:16,922
- No dear, anything the matter?

762
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:17,755
- No Mom.

763

- I'm gonna do it Dad I swear,

764
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,025
I just haven't had the chance.

765
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:27,273

- Hi.

768
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,682
- Hey thank you, that needed fixing.

769
00:34:37,682 --> 00:34:39,608
- So uh, when's this baby due?

770
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:42,819
- Sh, it's supposed to be a secret!

771
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:43,837
- Well, not for long right?

772
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,440
- No (giggles).

773
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,107
Hey honey, you okay?

774
00:34:48,941 --> 00:34:51,052
Was that your dad on the phone?

775
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:53,151
Teddy?
- Leave me alone Mom.

776
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:54,738
- I remember that age.

777
00:34:54,738 --> 00:34:58,008
- Uh, yeah his dad is
bugging him about something.

778
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:00,214
- I haven't met your husband, have I?

779
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:03,682
- Don't hold your breath, he
and the bride live in Chicago.

780
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:05,294
- Oh.
- Yeah.

781

782
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:17,165
- Jeff I'm sorry about this morning.

783
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:24,265
That was the call that I
was expecting from Robin.

784
00:35:24,265 --> 00:35:25,205
They gave it to Eric.

785
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:27,101
- They gave what to Eric?

786
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:30,486
- They gave the partnership to Eric.

787
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:31,319
- Oh no.

788
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:33,740
Not, and Eric!

789
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,652

791
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:41,664

793
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:48,931
Honey I am so sorry.

794
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:52,538
- I work my ass off for them
and they pass me up for Eric.

795
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:53,371
I'm a good lawyer.

796
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,441
- Yeah.
- Is the only game

797
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:56,070
in town about getting clients?

798
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,731
- That's how it is with
those big New York law firms.

799
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:02,552
Maybe if you went to another firm?

800
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:03,602
- If I go somewhere else I just have

801
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:05,211
to start all over again.

802
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:07,149
I don't know, maybe it
is time for a change.

803
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:11,232
- Yeah, maybe you should
think of a smaller firm.

804
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:15,651
Or a firm outside New York.

805
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,646
- Oh I don't know, I'm so confused.

806
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,282
- Hey.

807
00:36:19,282 --> 00:36:20,115
- Hold me.

808
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:21,901
Mmm.

809
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:36,038
- Why'd you drive so fast?

810
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:38,135
- I'm in a hurry.

811
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:39,021
- God I look like a wreck!

812
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:41,981
Can't you wait two minutes
while I fix my face?

813
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:43,908
- Take your time.

814
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:45,771
- [Woman] You forgot the pie!

815
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:46,688

00:36:51,732 --> 00:36:52,565

817
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:55,009
- In the kitchen!

818
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:04,730
- Julia.

819
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:09,946
- What in god's name are you doing here?

820
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:12,281
- That's it, no hi Will
and a welcome home,

821
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:15,075
I've missed you, no thank
god you've come back, no--

822
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:17,061
- I thought you left for
Santa Fe three days ago?

823
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:18,728
- I changed my mind.

824
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:22,032
Oh, what's for supper?

825
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,108

more like, uh, like turtle.

829
00:37:34,494 --> 00:37:37,244
Uh, needs basil or, or spikenard.

830
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:39,574
Got any spikenard?

831
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:40,553
- What's that?

832
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:43,265
It's an Old Testament aphrodisiac.

833
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:44,182
- Show off.

834
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:47,152

00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:14,967
Mmm, listen.

891
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,165
When I was little I used to
think the cicadas were saying

892
00:40:19,165 --> 00:40:22,582
"Get away, get away, get away, get away."

893
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:30,518
- I figured out how we can get away.

894
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:32,499
- How?

895
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:39,052
- Todd's job at Hudson
River Trust is open.

896
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:40,552
I'm gonna take it.

897
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:43,184
- What?

898
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:48,675
(chuckles) Where's this coming from?

899
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:51,052
- You said get away.

900
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:53,122
- No this is where I
plotted my getaway from

901
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,872
Hudson Falls, not to.

902
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:58,033
- Why I thought you'd want to ease up now.

903
00:40:58,033 --> 00:40:58,886
- Ease up,

904
00:40:58,886 --> 00:40:59,737
are you crazy?
- I thought that's what

905
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:00,733
you were saying!
- I have no intention of

906
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:02,711
easing up, I have to work
even harder this year

907
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:03,815
to make partner next year!

908
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:04,774
- What?
- I've got to nail

909
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:07,049
the Dahlberg case!

910
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,202
I don't believe you!

911
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:10,714
- Laura...
- I tell you that I don't

912
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:11,801
make partner and your solution is

913
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:13,083
to whisk us off to the burbs.

914
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,349
What am I supposed to do out here?

915
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:16,292
Open a fruit and vegetable stand?

916
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,116
- Okay, all right, you
can stay at the firm

917
00:41:18,116 --> 00:41:20,368
and you can come up here on weekends.

918
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:22,121
- Great, great, I'll live in the city

919
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:22,954
and you can live in the country

920
00:41:22,954 --> 00:41:24,839
and we'll have a long-distance marriage.

921
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,111
- Well Laura, we already do.

922
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:28,818
- [Laura] God you make me so angry,

923
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:30,117
acting on impulse like this.

924
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,399
- [Jeff] Laura, wait a second!

925
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,232
- [Laura] You know what Jeff?

926
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:33,312
- Ow!
- You're just like

927
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,517
the rest of my family!

928
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:38,115
Making it up as you go along.

929
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:40,257
- Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa wait!

930
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:41,728
Laura!
- I thought I could

931
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:44,171
count on you!
- Laura!

932
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,004
Fuck!

933
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:58,755
- It's tangled!
- Here turn it this way.

934
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:00,203
- No you're making it worse!

935
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:03,818
Will, this is my daughter
lawyer, uh, daughter Laura.

936
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:05,988
Will here is helping sort of.

937
00:42:05,988 --> 00:42:07,675
- Hi there.
- Don't let me interrupt.

938
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:08,508
Hi.

939
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:10,353
- Diane's gone off, you'll
have to make the cake.

940
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:11,186
- [Laura] I can't do it Mom,

941
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:13,936
I've got a big meeting on Monday.

942
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:23,954
(mumble), ugh, god, give me a break!

943
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:31,211
- [Julia] Laura!

944
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:46,194
Laura!

945
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,170
- I can't take this.

946
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,842
Voluntary simplicity.

947
00:43:19,282 --> 00:43:20,115
Great.

948
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,385
(birds singing)

949
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:33,135
(waves crashing)

950
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:43,449
(languorous music)

951
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:17,573
(geese honking)

952
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:04,688
- Oh, Grandpa.

953
00:45:16,863 --> 00:45:18,446
Not that creme, no.

954
00:45:19,913 --> 00:45:22,246
We are gong to, bake a cake.

955
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,537
Chocolate cake...

956
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:32,986
(water splashing)

957
00:45:47,169 --> 00:45:48,900
- Look at you Dad, we can't have you

958
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,311
looking like this for the party.

959
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:51,394
- Why?
- Jeff!

960
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:55,143
This is no time for a
dip for heaven's sake!

961
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:56,498
- Uh...
- We have guests arriving

962
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:58,021
at five!

963
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,037
Be a dear and wash Grandpa.

964
00:46:01,037 --> 00:46:02,764
- Okay.
- What what,

965
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:04,732
where are we going?
- We're going to take a bath.

966
00:46:04,732 --> 00:46:08,899
(vacuum cleaner whirring)
(furtive music)

967
00:46:12,847 --> 00:46:15,097
(clicking)

968
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,650
(thumping)

969
00:46:42,894 --> 00:46:45,054
- Mm, that cake smells good.

970
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:46,971
Where's that blue vase?

971
00:46:49,734 --> 00:46:53,049
- Mom I just found this in
the back of the cook book.

972
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:54,489
They're from Dad, they're 20 years old,

973
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:56,406
you never opened these.

974
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:02,428
I thought that you said that
he never tried to contact us?

975
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:03,640
You know about these?

976
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,368
- I don't have time
for this today my dear.

977
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:07,372
- Mom, stop what you're doing and

978
00:47:07,372 --> 00:47:10,289
take the time for a minute, please!

979
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,127
- Those are private!

980
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:15,787
- How do you know there isn't
anything in there for us?

981
00:47:15,787 --> 00:47:18,723
No, how are the kids, a
birthday greeting, anything?

982
00:47:18,723 --> 00:47:22,380
- That never occurred to me,
it was a very difficult time.

983
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,138
Finding him with the
babysitter, not a pretty sight.

984
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:26,871
- Maybe he tried to explain himself.

985
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:30,409
- I'm sure he did, he was a charmer.

986
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:32,742
But I'd heard it all before.

987
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:36,493
I was terribly hurt by him.

988
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:40,660
I really loved him, I must
have, cried for a month, longer!

989
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:44,463
But as it turned out I
didn't really need him,

990
00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:45,843
I did it all myself.

991
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:46,962
- Maybe you didn't need him
- Come on Grandma!

992
00:47:46,962 --> 00:47:48,379
but maybe we did?

993
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:51,226
- It's like Steve and Teddy.

994
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:52,376
- [Teddy] Grandma I got to go!

995
00:47:52,376 --> 00:47:53,782
- Things may not be perfect with them,

996
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:57,721
but at least they're connected,
at least Teddy has a father.

997
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:59,816
- I'm really late for practice Grandma!

998
00:47:59,816 --> 00:48:02,816
- In a minute.
- I'll take you Teddy.

999
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:12,072
And the cake comes out at 3:20.

1000
00:48:27,134 --> 00:48:30,021
- Quack quack, quack, quack.

1001
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:31,888
- (mumbles), when was
the last time you had

1002
00:48:31,888 --> 00:48:33,847
a bath old man?

1003
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:37,680
- Oh, in 1492, Columbus
sailed the ocean blue.

1004
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:40,771
- Huh, wise guy huh?

1005
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:42,261
What do you wear for the big day?

1006
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:44,056
- Oh, you're looking at it.

1007
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:47,806
My birthday suit (chuckles).

1008
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:50,769
Wha, wha-where's Martha?

1009
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,764
- Grandpa Martha's gone.

1010
00:48:57,725 --> 00:48:59,558
Laura may be gone too.

1011
00:49:00,626 --> 00:49:05,050
- What the hell you
talking about, Laura gone?

1012
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,415
Laura can't!

1013
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:08,515
- She had to--
- No, no!

1014
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:10,845
- She can't, Laura, Laura!
- What'd I do (mumbles).

1015
00:49:10,845 --> 00:49:13,762
Everybody in this family runs away!

1016
00:49:15,863 --> 00:49:17,604
- Where's Laura, where's Laura?

1017
00:49:17,604 --> 00:49:18,731
- Grandpa!
- Laura!

1018
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:21,648
(dog barking)
- Hey, hey hey hey, it's okay!

1019
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:22,738
It's okay!

1020
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:23,571
- Laura!
- It's okay,

1021
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:24,699
She's not here!
- Laura, Laura!

1022
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,318
- She's not dead!
- Laura!

1023
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,485
(dog barking)
- You seen her last night...

1024
00:49:33,685 --> 00:49:36,852
- Do you have any nail polish remover?

1025
00:49:43,636 --> 00:49:46,337
- Have I been a terrible mother?

1026
00:49:46,337 --> 00:49:48,254
- The worst I ever had.

1027
00:49:49,796 --> 00:49:53,678
- Did, do you miss
having, having a father?

1028
00:49:53,678 --> 00:49:55,399
- I don't know.

1029
00:49:55,399 --> 00:49:57,768
I was only two when Daddy left.

1030
00:49:57,768 --> 00:49:59,601
And Grandpa was there.

1031
00:50:02,114 --> 00:50:03,697
What I miss is Ron.

1032
00:50:05,016 --> 00:50:09,438
He's the sexiest man alive,
it's like I'm addicted to him!

1033
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:12,048
- Take up smoking, it's healthier.

1034
00:50:12,048 --> 00:50:13,228
- Don't you ever get lonely?

1035
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:14,061
- Never.

1036
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,582
- So Teddy how's life treating you?

1037
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:19,169
- Terrible.

1038
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:21,207
My dad want's me to come live with him

1039
00:50:21,207 --> 00:50:23,651
in Chicago, with his new family.

1040
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:24,797
- What does your mom say?

1041
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:26,834
- She doesn't know.

1042
00:50:26,834 --> 00:50:29,380
- Yikes.
- I promised Dad I'd tell her,

1043
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,643
I just can't get up the nerve.

1044
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,530
There is gonna be a big war.

1045
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,351
- You want me to talk to her about it?

1046
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:38,029
- Well that'd be great, would you?

1047
00:50:38,029 --> 00:50:40,706
- Yeah, I'll talk to here
as soon as we get there.

1048
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:41,539
- Julia,

1049
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:47,356
when am I gonna get that
tour of your studio?

1050
00:50:47,356 --> 00:50:50,722
- Well, you're here now,
why not look around?

1051
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:52,902
- Your work is so witty.

1052
00:50:52,902 --> 00:50:54,823
I love it, kind of like a cross

1053
00:50:54,823 --> 00:50:58,430
between Pitaro and Nicky (mumbles).

1054
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,373
Do you know what I really like?

1055
00:51:01,373 --> 00:51:04,532
The playfulness, the voluptuousness.

1056
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:06,733
- Are you talking about my work?

1057
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:08,618
- You are some woman,

1058
00:51:08,618 --> 00:51:10,117
Julia.
- Look Will,

1059
00:51:10,117 --> 00:51:13,447
I really think that it--
- I don't agree.

1060
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:14,280
- Mmm.

1061
00:51:17,943 --> 00:51:19,732
This is crazy.

1062
00:51:19,732 --> 00:51:23,254
- Listen, I'm just as
surprised as you are.

1063
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:25,682
I guess there are times in life when you

1064
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,099
just have to let love happen.

1065
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,033
- I did.

1066
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:36,604
I bared my soul to you,
I, told you my whole life

1067
00:51:36,604 --> 00:51:38,271
story at that party.

1068
00:51:39,382 --> 00:51:42,181
You know all my secrets,
but I thought you were

1069
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:44,609
leaving the next day, why did you stay?

1070
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:45,526
- For this.

1071
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:48,840
- Look at you.

1072
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,323
- (chuckles) Who died?

1073
00:51:52,323 --> 00:51:54,798
- We're having a party.

1074
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:58,131
(train whistle blowing)

1075
00:51:59,487 --> 00:52:02,404
- [Grandpa] That would be the 3:46.

1076
00:52:05,538 --> 00:52:07,657
- You've had a good live,
haven't you Grandpa?

1077
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:08,490
- So far.

1078
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:12,150
- Well, if I make it to 85,

1079
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,317
I hope I have as much to look back on.

1080
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,903
- There was a young man, from Nantucket.

1081
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,987
Who made money, by god, by the bucket.

1082
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,850
Poor sod hated his work.

1083
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:33,913
- Yeah, so what'd he do?

1084
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:35,486
- I forgot.

1085
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:40,125
Hold on, poor sod hated his
work, felt like a real jerk,

1086
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:43,292
till finally one day he said chuck it!

1087
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:46,218
- Chuck it!

1088
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:48,104
- Chuck it!

1089
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:52,665
(pleasant music)

1090
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,406
(beeping)
(fax machine rumbling)

1091
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:14,117
(players chattering)
(whistle blowing)

1092
00:53:14,117 --> 00:53:16,751
- Yeah I'm sorry for
the scheduling mix-up.

1093
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:20,949
But don't worry, the Tiger's
will get their chance.

1094
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,062
Hi, my beautiful sister.

1095
00:53:22,062 --> 00:53:23,530
Hey.
- See you later Chris, hi.

1096
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:24,965
- Hey thanks for picking Teddy up.

1097
00:53:24,965 --> 00:53:26,131
- Oh no problem.

1098
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:27,401
(whistle blowing)
Listen, Teddy told me

1099
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:28,923
on the way up
- He's so excited that

1100
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:31,453
you guys are here, he just
loves having you guys.

1101
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:32,933
Why don't you come more often?

1102
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:34,560
- Oh, Jeff just broke the news to me

1103
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,803
that he want's to move up here.

1104
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:38,251
- No way, that'd be so great!

1105
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:39,913
(whistle blowing)
- Uh, I think he's having

1106
00:53:39,913 --> 00:53:43,144
a mid-life crises.
- Go Teddy, ooh!

1107
00:53:43,144 --> 00:53:44,085
(whistles blowing)
- Anyway why can't

1108
00:53:44,085 --> 00:53:45,572
you commute?
- I already work

1109
00:53:45,572 --> 00:53:48,599
an 80-hour week.
- 80-hour week?

1110
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,190
How'd he get you to take that
trip to the Canadian woods?

1111
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,385
- He feels like he needs
those things for his sanity,

1112
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:55,364
but I don't need them.

1113
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:56,785
- I don't know.

1114
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:59,611
When you came back from that
trip you were a changed woman.

1115
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,444
- Really?

1116
00:54:01,373 --> 00:54:03,181
In what way?

1117
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:04,625
(thumping)
- Hey!

1118
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:05,958
Ouch, that hurt!

1119
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:08,846
(whistles blowing)
- Oh look at him!

1120
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,366
Teddy, he's in another
fight, I can't believe this!

1121
00:54:11,366 --> 00:54:14,040
(whistles blowing)

1122
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,873
- Break it up!

1123
00:54:14,873 --> 00:54:15,706
No fighting!

1124
00:54:15,706 --> 00:54:16,967
Ted, penalty box for two minutes!

1125
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:18,757
- [Teddy] He started it!

1126
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:20,871
(whistle blowing)
- Okay everybody back into

1127
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:22,347
positions, all right
- Hey!

1128
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:23,912
- [Coach] let's start a new face-off!

1129
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:25,690
- Look at you!

1130
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:26,611
What's the matter with
you, you're acting like

1131
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:28,015
a little wild animal out there?

1132
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,651
(whistle blowing)

1133
00:54:29,651 --> 00:54:30,484
- Did you see that?

1134
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:33,454
That was so unfair, he hit me first!

1135
00:54:33,454 --> 00:54:35,544
(telephone beeping)

1136
00:54:35,544 --> 00:54:38,307
(telephone ringing)

1137
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:39,879
- Hello?
- Hi Clifton it's Laura.

1138
00:54:39,879 --> 00:54:40,712
- [Clifton] Oh hi Laura.

1139
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:42,931
- I wanted to know when the
Dahlberg meeting was on Monday?

1140
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,027
- [Clifton] Oh, Laura
listen I'm glad you called.

1141
00:54:45,027 --> 00:54:46,182
Dhalberg had to go to Europe,

1142
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,151
so we rescheduled for next week.

1143
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,151
- Great, good, then I don't
have to work this weekend.

1144
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:52,306
- [Clifton] No, you know it might not be

1145
00:54:52,306 --> 00:54:54,357
a bad idea to get a headstart.

1146
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,229
(whistle blowing)

1147
00:54:56,229 --> 00:54:59,279
- Clifton I'm gonna take the weekend off.

1148
00:54:59,279 --> 00:55:01,301
- [Clifton] That's fine
Laura, have a good weekend.

1149
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,863
See 'ya Monday.

1150
00:55:02,863 --> 00:55:06,013
(dial tone buzzing)

1151
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:06,972
- Cliff's an asshole!

1152
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:08,906
- Hey, hey, don't you say that,

1153
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:09,943
you would never say things like

1154
00:55:09,943 --> 00:55:11,244
that in front of your father!

1155
00:55:11,244 --> 00:55:12,732
I feel like shipping you off to Chicago

1156
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:16,202
to get him to straighten you out!

1157
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:18,440
- [Teddy] Just great.

1158
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,416
(mumbling)

1159
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:21,605
- I'm so mad at him.

1160
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:22,637
- Honey you don't understand.

1161
00:55:22,637 --> 00:55:24,900
Steve's been pressuring him to come live

1162
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,216
with him in Chicago.

1163
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:27,476
- What?

1164
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:28,766
- Teddy told me in the car and I was

1165
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:30,476
supposed to tell you and I forgot.

1166
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:32,309
- You forgot to tell me that?

1167
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:34,903
Jesus Lora, nice work.

1168
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:35,820
Hey, Teddy!

1169
00:55:38,926 --> 00:55:41,343
(clattering)

1170
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:46,062
Come here, I'm sorry, Laura just told me.

1171
00:55:46,062 --> 00:55:47,970
I never would have said that.

1172
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,765
- You didn't tell her?

1173
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:50,848
- I meant to.

1174
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:53,480
- Honey is that what you
were trying to tell me,

1175
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,093
that you want to go live with your dad,

1176
00:55:55,093 --> 00:55:56,895
and you were afraid to say it to me?

1177
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,677
- No I want to stay here with you,

1178
00:55:58,677 --> 00:56:00,055
I just don't know how to tell Dad

1179
00:56:00,055 --> 00:56:02,056
without telling him about the baby.

1180
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:04,567
- Oh Teddy, I can handle your dad,

1181
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:06,311
don't worry about that.

1182
00:56:06,311 --> 00:56:08,617
And, when Grandma moves, we'll get our own

1183
00:56:08,617 --> 00:56:11,115
little place together, and it can be us,

1184
00:56:11,115 --> 00:56:14,619
and the baby will be
here, and, okay my sweety?

1185
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:16,202
I love you so much!

1186
00:56:18,924 --> 00:56:20,557
(thumping)
(groaning)

1187
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:22,057
- Nice work Laura.

1188
00:56:36,356 --> 00:56:38,356
- Clear water home page.

1189
00:56:40,786 --> 00:56:44,286
Um, let's look at PCPs on the Mississippi.

1190
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:48,121
- It's a rubber-stamp meeting.

1191
00:56:48,121 --> 00:56:48,994
- Uh hmm.
- The board will be

1192
00:56:48,994 --> 00:56:50,757
rooting for you.

1193
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:52,828
Everyone in the non-profit world knows

1194
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,773
the trick is fund raising,
so you're background

1195
00:56:54,773 --> 00:56:57,981
in advertising, your awards are crucial.

1196
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:58,921
- Right.
- You can catch up

1197
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:00,549
on the science later.

1198
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:01,382
- Good.

1199
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:06,815
- Are you actually
going through with this?

1200
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,982
- Jeff I'll see you guys at the party.

1201
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:15,489
- I thought this was
still under discussion.

1202
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:17,906
- Well you ran off, remember?

1203
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:22,603
- Yeah well, I'm here now.

1204
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:28,036
Jeff, I realize that I've
been so focused on my work...

1205
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,964
I want to redirect.

1206
00:57:34,523 --> 00:57:37,105
The issue here is priorities.

1207
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:40,772
I know that I need to
make more time for us.

1208
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:43,393
What if I take weekends off

1209
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,979
and we rent a house out in the Hamptons?

1210
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:47,562
- No, it's more than just that.

1211
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:51,099
(sighing)

1212
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:54,853
Look I don't know when it happened, but,

1213
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:57,603
what makes me happy, has changed.

1214
00:57:58,623 --> 00:58:02,623
And taking this job is a
step in that direction.

1215
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:06,982
- What do they pay?

1216
00:58:06,982 --> 00:58:09,400
- Maybe about a third of what I make now.

1217
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,424
- We can't afford that Jeff.

1218
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:13,577
How are we ever gonna
save up to have kids?

1219
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:15,401
- Well we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

1220
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:17,788
- You sound like my mother.

1221
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:20,115
Dropping out was not
part of the deal Jeff.

1222
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:22,912
- I am not dropping out,
I am changing careers.

1223
00:58:22,912 --> 00:58:24,170
- No you're floundering!

1224
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,736
- Laura I have never felt saner!

1225
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,088
- I (mumbles), then I'm baffled!

1226
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,600
What is it?

1227
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,954
- I'm beginning to think
being a work junkie

1228
00:58:31,954 --> 00:58:33,792
may just be an escape.

1229
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:35,637
- From what?
- I have no idea,

1230
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,912
that's what I've got to find out!

1231
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:39,600
- Are you accusing me of being shallow

1232
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,055
because I love my work?

1233
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:42,724
- No I'm not accusing you of anything.

1234
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:45,800
- My last case, I won,
50 workers compensation

1235
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,838
from being crippled by faulty

1236
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:47,843
jackhammers!
- God dammit Laura

1237
00:58:47,843 --> 00:58:49,482
that is so unfair!

1238
00:58:49,482 --> 00:58:51,143
I did three spots for the ad council

1239
00:58:51,143 --> 00:58:54,527
and dammit Laura, that's not the point!

1240
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:56,444
This is not about work!

1241
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,893
It's about my whole life!

1242
00:59:00,893 --> 00:59:02,149
You want to be in the thick of things,

1243
00:59:02,149 --> 00:59:04,070
I'd be happy living in a shack somewhere.

1244
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,381
- A shack?
- Yes.

1245
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:07,800
And something else, I'm sick
of waiting to have kids.

1246
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,973
And I'm sick of pretending

1247
00:59:08,973 --> 00:59:10,906
to be in a marriage when we're not!

1248
00:59:10,906 --> 00:59:13,187
We're no fun anymore.

1249
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:16,020
We don't play, we don't make love.

1250
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,264
You don't need me.

1251
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:25,122
You won't even miss me when I'm gone.

1252
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:36,322
(snoring)
(comically furtive music)

1253
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:42,809
(suspenseful music)

1254
00:59:44,142 --> 00:59:46,559
(whimpering)

1255
00:59:59,717 --> 01:00:02,550
(desultory music)

1256
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:17,923
(Will laughing)

1257
01:00:20,262 --> 01:00:23,262
- Get dressed, I have people coming!

1258
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:39,795
(patient music)

1259
01:01:11,604 --> 01:01:13,854
(rattling)

1260
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,708
(knocking)

1261
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:17,541
- Laura?

1262
01:01:20,558 --> 01:01:22,475
I just need my clothes.

1263
01:01:25,651 --> 01:01:28,734
(thumping)
- Go away!

1264
01:01:39,389 --> 01:01:42,306
(doorbell ringing)

1265
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:50,665
- Oh, for me!

1266
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,582
Thank you thanks a lot!

1267
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:01,561
- [Will] What a matinee,

1268
01:02:01,561 --> 01:02:05,572
I can't wait for the evening performance.

1269
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:06,405
- Oh,

1270
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:09,498
Lord!

1271
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:16,551
What have I got myself into (chuckles)?

1272
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:18,280
- Flowers, are they for me?

1273
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,507
- No no no, no, they're for the party.

1274
01:02:21,507 --> 01:02:24,307
- Well let me see the card,
they might be from Ron.

1275
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,813
Are they for you?

1276
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:28,596
Do you have a secret admirer Mom?

1277
01:02:28,596 --> 01:02:30,135
Who is it?

1278
01:02:30,135 --> 01:02:31,587
It's that hot guy from Santa Fe

1279
01:02:31,587 --> 01:02:33,139
isn't it?
- Mind your own business!

1280
01:02:33,139 --> 01:02:34,720
- [Diane] Are you blushing?

1281
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,979
You're actually blushing Mom!

1282
01:02:36,979 --> 01:02:40,146
This is a first, let me see the card!

1283
01:02:40,146 --> 01:02:42,185
- So what did you decide, you
gonna go live with your dad?

1284
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:44,460
- I'm staying here!
- Good move!

1285
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,322
- How do you know, you
didn't even know my dad!

1286
01:02:46,322 --> 01:02:47,410
- Yeah well I know you're mom.

1287
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:48,442
- Oh!
- Hey!

1288
01:02:48,442 --> 01:02:50,222
- [Diane] Hey, back it up.

1289
01:02:50,222 --> 01:02:51,412
- [Jeff] Okay this way.

1290
01:02:51,412 --> 01:02:52,527
- [Teddy] This is heavy.

1291
01:02:52,527 --> 01:02:53,605
- [Diane] You need some help?

1292
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:54,855
- No we got it.

1293
01:02:56,232 --> 01:02:58,294
(sighing)

1294
01:02:58,294 --> 01:03:00,211
- I look like a lawyer.

1295
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:22,187
- Hey Jeff no offense
but are you gonna change?

1296
01:03:22,187 --> 01:03:23,776
- Laura locked me out of the room.

1297
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:25,271
- Why?
- Well I talked to her

1298
01:03:25,271 --> 01:03:27,894
like you said, she went ballistic.

1299
01:03:27,894 --> 01:03:29,474
Thank you.

1300
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,427
So I took Todd's job.

1301
01:03:31,427 --> 01:03:32,433
- I thought you guys were married,

1302
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,742
don't you make any decisions together?

1303
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:38,379
- Why don't you get yourselves a drink?

1304
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:39,709
Jeff?
- Hmm?

1305
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:41,109
- Get dressed, people are here.

1306
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,284
- Laura locked him out.

1307
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:43,863
- Diane!
- Why?

1308
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,946
- He doesn't communicate.

1309
01:03:48,231 --> 01:03:51,292
- Ah the love birds, did
you ever seen such devotion?

1310
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:54,589
- They're adorable!
(chuckling)

1311
01:03:54,589 --> 01:03:55,422
Julia!

1312
01:03:57,165 --> 01:04:01,705
Oh I get it, no public
displays of affection.

1313
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:04,288
- Excuse me, well, there's Dad.

1314
01:04:07,971 --> 01:04:09,230
Dad?

1315
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,795
- What's going on with the two of you?

1316
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:14,462
- Let's get a drink.

1317
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,519
(cheerfully perky music)

1318
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:29,111
- Julia!
- Yago darling thank you

1319
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:30,656
for coming!
- Ah!

1320
01:04:30,656 --> 01:04:32,103
A roast pig?

1321
01:04:32,103 --> 01:04:33,492
You barbarian!

1322
01:04:33,492 --> 01:04:36,086
When you going to sacrifice the virgins?

1323
01:04:36,086 --> 01:04:37,316
- First we have to find some.

1324
01:04:37,316 --> 01:04:38,520
- Oh this is Dudley McGruder,

1325
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,228
your patron from Microsoft.

1326
01:04:40,228 --> 01:04:42,581
- What a great pleasure, I love your work!

1327
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:44,010
- You have a good eye!

1328
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:44,999
(chuckling)

1329
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:46,654
- May I take a look around
your sculpture garden?

1330
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,583
- Oh yes come along I'll give you a tour.

1331
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,005
- No, I'll be fine--
- Listen most people

1332
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:52,349
don't know shit about
art, you have to tell them

1333
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:54,371
what they're looking at,
think it's something to buy,

1334
01:04:54,371 --> 01:04:55,600
like toilet paper.

1335
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,310
- [Dudley] I think I can be trusted.

1336
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,694
- Oh yes a thousand pardons,
I'm sure you could teach me.

1337
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:03,067
- Let me point you in the right direction.

1338
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:04,975
Julia's a brilliant sculptor.

1339
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:07,063
- Yes she is.
- And uh you know,

1340
01:05:07,063 --> 01:05:10,178
I know a lot of would-be
artists, I live in Santa Fe.

1341
01:05:10,178 --> 01:05:12,520
- Oh, you have my sentiments.
- Oh, Julien!

1342
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,476
Hi!

1343
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:14,879
Hey were you guys always this cute?

1344
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:16,567
(chuckling)

1345
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:17,584
Whoa.

1346
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:20,501
(brash Jazz music)

1347
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,417
- So, you're hot girl.

1348
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,275
- So are those two the father?

1349
01:05:28,275 --> 01:05:30,442
- Not even close Sherlock.

1350
01:05:33,312 --> 01:05:36,340
- Look at their body language,
I think they were fucking!

1351
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,751
- Oh, nah, you know Diane.

1352
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:40,735
She treats every man like a lover,

1353
01:05:40,735 --> 01:05:43,421
that's why they all want her.

1354
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:47,588
- Can that be learned, or do
you have to be born with it?

1355
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:55,276
- Definitely?
- Hello.

1356
01:05:55,276 --> 01:05:57,163
- I'll call you back.

1357
01:05:57,163 --> 01:05:59,973
- I'm Laura.
- Dudley, McGruder.

1358
01:05:59,973 --> 01:06:01,777
- So tell me about yourself Dudley,

1359
01:06:01,777 --> 01:06:02,982
are you from around here?

1360
01:06:02,982 --> 01:06:05,516
- Oh no, no I'm uh, only
up here on business.

1361
01:06:05,516 --> 01:06:06,903
- A working weekend!

1362
01:06:06,903 --> 01:06:09,181
- I work every weekend.

1363
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:11,950
- (laughs) So do I.

1364
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:14,124
I get hassled about it by everybody.

1365
01:06:14,124 --> 01:06:17,973
- Maybe you're, hanging
out with the wrong crowd?

1366
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:19,187
- Precisely, so tell me about

1367
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:20,356
your crowd?
- Jeff!

1368
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:23,291
We are so thrilled to have
a man with your experience

1369
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,379
coming to work with us
at Hudson River Trust.

1370
01:06:25,379 --> 01:06:27,581
Your ad with the penguin,
oh it was brilliant!

1371
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:28,539
- Great.
- No wonder it might

1372
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:29,470
win a Cleo.

1373
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,690
I mean, a producer of TV commercials.

1374
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,762
Now that you're taking the job

1375
01:06:32,762 --> 01:06:34,188
I assume you'll be moving up here.

1376
01:06:34,188 --> 01:06:36,787
- Well the uh...
- Dudley, I need a drink.

1377
01:06:36,787 --> 01:06:38,951
- Well let's get you one.
- Wonderful rustic pattern

1378
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:40,868
that goes with the job.

1379
01:06:41,754 --> 01:06:45,347
- All right now wait a minute,
come on you son-of-a-gun!

1380
01:06:45,347 --> 01:06:46,198
Can't ha, there

1381
01:06:46,198 --> 01:06:47,156
we go.
- My mommma can open it.

1382
01:06:47,156 --> 01:06:49,337
- Here we go, come on, that's right.

1383
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:52,246
(paper ripping)
There you are.

1384
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:54,079
Aw,
- See what it is.

1385
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,633
(Teddy mumbles)
- can't wait, I can't wait,

1386
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:58,124
- Oh, oh (mumbles)!
- I can't, oh, holy cow!

1387
01:06:58,124 --> 01:06:59,629
- Jeff!
- Excuse me.

1388
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:00,706
- This is my cousin Helen.

1389
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:02,301
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1390
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:03,398
Hi.
- Hi.

1391
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,620
- He's moving to Washngton.

1392
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,156
- Todd, it's not official yet.

1393
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,664
- Hi pumpkin!
- What kept you?

1394
01:07:08,664 --> 01:07:10,674
- Mmm, so hard to park.
(chuckling)

1395
01:07:10,674 --> 01:07:14,256
- They've been apart
for all of five minutes.

1396
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:15,637
- Jeff!
- Eric!

1397
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:16,470
- [Eric] What are you doing here?

1398
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,809
- Well the guest of honor's
Laura's grandfather, so...

1399
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:19,903
- Oh I didn't know that!

1400
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,499
- Yeah.
- I practice law with Laura,

1401
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:23,208
you know, or I did!

1402
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,779
- Did?

1403
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:27,278
Is Laura quitting?
- No, I am.

1404
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:29,114
When Clifton called last
night to say I made partner,

1405
01:07:29,114 --> 01:07:30,110
I realized I didn't want it.

1406
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,829
- My handsome precious, it's your call.

1407
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:33,435
You've always wanted to go into politics.

1408
01:07:33,435 --> 01:07:35,148
- So I called Uncle Lewis
and he was kind enough

1409
01:07:35,148 --> 01:07:36,626
to offer me the post of Undersecretary

1410
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:39,361
to the Ambassador to, what is
the name of that country dear?

1411
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:41,192
- Oh it keeps changing depending
on who wins the revolution.

1412
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:42,660
(chuckling)

1413
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,148
- Have you told Laura your news?

1414
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:46,470
- My darlings, Laura, Presley,

1415
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,919
I have the most wonderful
news for your Mother!

1416
01:07:48,919 --> 01:07:50,726
An adorable couple wants to buy the house,

1417
01:07:50,726 --> 01:07:51,739
or at last the property.

1418
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:53,235
I think they're gonna tear down the house.

1419
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,249
- [Presley] How can you
tear down this house?

1420
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:55,082
- [Lesley] Ridiculous!

1421
01:07:55,082 --> 01:07:55,915
- [Realtor] Ridiculous?

1422
01:07:55,915 --> 01:07:57,097
You serve any hard liquor here?

1423
01:07:57,097 --> 01:07:59,085
- I got trapped into
law school by my parents

1424
01:07:59,085 --> 01:08:01,761
and hated it, and who cares
about writs and torts,

1425
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:03,647
and pari-passu--

1426
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:04,953
- [Woman] And party of the first part.

1427
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:08,435
- And all that Latin
lingo crap (chuckles).

1428
01:08:08,435 --> 01:08:11,460
- Eric, what is he doing here?

1429
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,164
- I think you should tell Laura your news.

1430
01:08:14,164 --> 01:08:17,810
I think she would be so happy, for you.

1431
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:19,022
- Excuse me...
- It's going too far

1432
01:08:19,022 --> 01:08:20,391
Charlotte, (mumbles).

1433
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:21,224
- Julia!

1434
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:23,838
Julia wait!

1435
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:25,588
My god you look sexy!

1436
01:08:27,094 --> 01:08:28,775
- Not here, for heaven's sake!

1437
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,907
- You were amazing this afternoon!

1438
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,824
- Will, please not now!

1439
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:42,893
- Mom, that was so rude!

1440
01:08:44,548 --> 01:08:47,607
- The last thing I need,
today, is an ardent suitor.

1441
01:08:47,607 --> 01:08:48,912
I have 40 people in the house,

1442
01:08:48,912 --> 01:08:50,765
my biggest client is here,

1443
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:52,388
I haven't had five
minutes to schmooze him!

1444
01:08:52,388 --> 01:08:53,649
- Who do you think you are?

1445
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:54,659
Do you bite Will's head off after

1446
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:56,341
you've just had sex with him?

1447
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,142
I saw you in the studio Mom, Christ,

1448
01:08:58,142 --> 01:09:00,672
you are some kind of role model!

1449
01:09:00,672 --> 01:09:04,528
You are so militantly self-sufficient!

1450
01:09:04,528 --> 01:09:06,847
- What's this coming from?

1451
01:09:06,847 --> 01:09:11,014
- I'm just having the worst
day of my life, I'm sorry.

1452
01:09:11,878 --> 01:09:15,367
Jeff and I got into a huge fight today.

1453
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:18,165
- Darling I'm sorry, Laura.

1454
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:20,552
- He's decided that he wants
to take over Todd's job

1455
01:09:20,552 --> 01:09:23,442
at Hudson River Trust and move up here.

1456
01:09:23,442 --> 01:09:25,775
- Oh.
- Without me.

1457
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:28,074
I'm so afraid of Jeff changing.

1458
01:09:28,074 --> 01:09:29,524
- Jeff is changing.
- I know.

1459
01:09:29,524 --> 01:09:31,024
- You're changing.

1460
01:09:33,046 --> 01:09:35,266
People are un-unpredictable.

1461
01:09:35,266 --> 01:09:37,403
It's what makes life exciting, hmm?

1462
01:09:37,403 --> 01:09:38,631
- [Lesley] Julia!

1463
01:09:38,631 --> 01:09:41,048
Julia, we need you over here!

1464
01:09:44,707 --> 01:09:48,207
- [Diane] Ron (chuckles).

1465
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,781
- Too many people, too much work.

1466
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:07,109
- Drena, I love you.

1467
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:08,956
- Hey!
- You okay?

1468
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:10,069
- Yeah why?

1469
01:10:10,069 --> 01:10:12,155
- Oh I mean about Ron and Diane.

1470
01:10:12,155 --> 01:10:14,705
I thought that you guys had
something going this weekend.

1471
01:10:14,705 --> 01:10:17,493
- Oh, no no no, we're just buddies.

1472
01:10:17,493 --> 01:10:18,562
- Oh.
- You know this place

1473
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:20,320
will make a great bed and breakfast.

1474
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,436
- You know I've always thought that.

1475
01:10:22,436 --> 01:10:24,060
But, I have to make a place for Grandpa,

1476
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,180
I don't really see him living in Soho.

1477
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,864
- Grandpa, well we give him his own wing.

1478
01:10:27,864 --> 01:10:30,428
I mean, you can give him his own wing.

1479
01:10:30,428 --> 01:10:31,600
(chuckling)

1480
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,984
I could draw up some
plans for you if you want.

1481
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:35,343
- You could.

1482
01:10:35,343 --> 01:10:38,487
- And if you do that, you're
gonna need a good plumber.

1483
01:10:38,487 --> 01:10:39,320
- I know.

1484
01:10:41,861 --> 01:10:43,944
- Oh have you seen Laura?

1485
01:10:45,476 --> 01:10:47,976
- She's around here somewhere.

1486
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:02,729
- [Jeff] Laura.

1487
01:11:06,143 --> 01:11:09,143
(guests chattering)

1488
01:11:16,928 --> 01:11:18,662
- I think Bud the plumber just made this

1489
01:11:18,662 --> 01:11:20,495
really big move on me.

1490
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:22,927
(giggling)

1491
01:11:22,927 --> 01:11:24,066
- Does he know you're pregnant?

1492
01:11:24,066 --> 01:11:24,983
- Yes, yes!

1493
01:11:26,609 --> 01:11:29,192
- Guess, I'd worry about Steve.

1494
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,727
If he wants to make a fuss about custody

1495
01:11:31,727 --> 01:11:33,528
he's got a great case.

1496
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:37,300
Unmarried mother, un-named
father, pubescent boy.

1497
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,936
- Steve won't be a problem.

1498
01:11:39,936 --> 01:11:42,569
- (chuckles) Les, look--

1499
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:45,263
- In law school you study
hypotheticals, right?

1500
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:47,209
- Uh hmm.
- Ex husband gets remarried,

1501
01:11:47,209 --> 01:11:49,970
moves let's say, oh to the Midwest.

1502
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,457
Gets together with the ex-wife,

1503
01:11:51,457 --> 01:11:52,705
they go through the storage bins

1504
01:11:52,705 --> 01:11:54,932
to look through all their old stuff,

1505
01:11:54,932 --> 01:11:57,632
one thing leads to another, and,

1506
01:11:57,632 --> 01:12:00,526
let's just say I was
Steve's bachelor party.

1507
01:12:00,526 --> 01:12:03,642
- Oh my god (laughs)!

1508
01:12:03,642 --> 01:12:04,475
Les!

1509
01:12:05,879 --> 01:12:09,398
I had no idea storage bins were so sexy.

1510
01:12:09,398 --> 01:12:10,952
What does Steve say?

1511
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,405
- Oh, as far as Steve's
concerned it never happened.

1512
01:12:13,405 --> 01:12:17,518
I'm on my own, the new
wife wouldn't understand.

1513
01:12:17,518 --> 01:12:19,580
- Artificial insemination
the perfect cover up.

1514
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,225
- It is a proven gene pool.

1515
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:22,475
- That's right.

1516
01:12:23,496 --> 01:12:26,538
Hey, you look respectable now!

1517
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:27,538
- Thank you.

1518
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:33,707
All I need is a yellow tie, right Laura?

1519
01:12:33,707 --> 01:12:35,874
- No, you're not the type.

1520
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,497
- Ouch.

1521
01:12:38,497 --> 01:12:41,664
Just been dissed by a strawberry tart.

1522
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:47,939
- I think you two need another
trip to the Canadian woods.

1523
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:50,618
(chuckling)

1524
01:12:50,618 --> 01:12:53,263
- There a, was a young fellow named Nap,

1525
01:12:53,263 --> 01:12:55,219
who had a terrible case of the clap--

1526
01:12:55,219 --> 01:12:58,905
- Mayor Sweet, Mrs. Sweet,
how sweet of you to come.

1527
01:12:58,905 --> 01:13:00,145
Now that you're here it's time for the

1528
01:13:00,145 --> 01:13:02,212
celebration part--
- Look this way Mr. McBurney,

1529
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:03,738
we just want to get a
few impressions of you

1530
01:13:03,738 --> 01:13:04,870
on this wonderful occasion.

1531
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,379
- Yeah yeah, I'm the mayor, do I know you?

1532
01:13:07,379 --> 01:13:10,221
- Is it true what they
say about men in kilts?

1533
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:11,256
- Well.

1534
01:13:11,256 --> 01:13:14,083
(camera clacking)

1535
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:16,492
- Can you believe this
guy was once the mayor?

1536
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:17,905
I'm surprised he didn't get further.

1537
01:13:17,905 --> 01:13:20,283
- A-Attention, everybody!

1538
01:13:20,283 --> 01:13:22,998
(bagpipes blaring)

1539
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,401
Not now!

1540
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,732
Y-You are a surprise for later!

1541
01:13:27,732 --> 01:13:28,565
- Oh.

1542
01:13:33,606 --> 01:13:38,030
- I think the mayor
wants to say a few words!

1543
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:40,681
- Ladies and gentlemen--

1544
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,000
- It's a real honor to be
here today to help celebrate

1545
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,776
the 85th birthday of one of
our most prominent citizens

1546
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:50,859
and former mayor, so,
here's to another 85 years!

1547
01:13:52,898 --> 01:13:56,243
- Thank you!
(applauding)

1548
01:13:56,243 --> 01:13:57,720
- Ladies and gentlemen--

1549
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,553
- Dad!

1550
01:14:02,175 --> 01:14:05,957
To my father, and your former mayor,

1551
01:14:05,957 --> 01:14:09,374
and everybody's friend Angus J. McBurney!

1552
01:14:10,596 --> 01:14:12,679
Bud, Bud, lend me a hand.

1553
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,199
- [Guests] Ah!

1554
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:18,775
- Winnie!
- It's the dog!

1555
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:20,117
(squealing)
(chuckling)

1556
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:21,367
- It's perfect!

1557
01:14:22,703 --> 01:14:26,144
- Oh I love you, I love you dear!

1558
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:28,621
(exotic suspenseful music)

1559
01:14:28,621 --> 01:14:30,142
(screaming)

1560
01:14:30,142 --> 01:14:34,309
(yelling)
(comical music)

1561
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:46,504
- (mumbles) Teddy, Teddy!

1562
01:14:46,504 --> 01:14:47,337
- [Teddy] Goliath, where have

1563
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:48,295
you been?
- Big trouble.

1564
01:14:48,295 --> 01:14:51,434
All right, whao, hey
let's hear it for the man!

1565
01:14:51,434 --> 01:14:52,641
(applauding)

1566
01:14:52,641 --> 01:14:56,912
- [Teddy] Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1567
01:14:56,912 --> 01:14:58,495
- Jeff is so funny.

1568
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,919
- Yeah.

1569
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:03,574
(chuckling)
- Grandpa is way too old.

1570
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:05,296
- [Diane] I bet you Laura
has a gadget for this!

1571
01:15:05,296 --> 01:15:06,356
- [Lesley] I bet she does.

1572
01:15:06,356 --> 01:15:07,862
- I want to carry it over,

1573
01:15:07,862 --> 01:15:11,370
I look really good in candlelight.

1574
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:12,749
- Whatever (laughs)!
- Whatever.

1575
01:15:12,749 --> 01:15:15,459
(laughing)
- What?

1576
01:15:15,459 --> 01:15:18,411
Okay grandpa make a
wish and blow them out!

1577
01:15:18,411 --> 01:15:19,244
- Ah!

1578
01:15:20,466 --> 01:15:23,312
(lips sputtering)

1579
01:15:23,312 --> 01:15:25,621
(laughing)
(clapping)

1580
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:28,357
- [All] For he's the jolly good fellow,

1581
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,450
for he's the jolly good fellow,

1582
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:33,033
for he's the jolly good fellow,

1583
01:15:34,717 --> 01:15:36,550
which nobody can deny!

1584
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,297
(applauding)

1585
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:43,483
- I love this family.

1586
01:15:43,483 --> 01:15:44,847
- Me too.

1587
01:15:44,847 --> 01:15:46,585
I think when I proposed to Laura,

1588
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:50,265
I was asking them all to
marry me, even the old guy.

1589
01:15:50,265 --> 01:15:52,682
- Water balloons, great idea!

1590
01:15:54,762 --> 01:15:56,490
- Hey!
- Loose something?

1591
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,700
- Dudley!

1592
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,047
- The car's here, so I'll
be leaving in a few minutes.

1593
01:16:01,047 --> 01:16:03,250
Oh, traffic's going to be
terrible this time of day.

1594
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,989
- Uh hmm.
- All those, Saturday night

1595
01:16:04,989 --> 01:16:05,953
bridge and tunnel people coming

1596
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:08,620
into Manhattan for a little fun.

1597
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,434
So what do you do for fun Laura?

1598
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:16,601
- Ah, oh boy, I get dragged
places against my will.

1599
01:16:17,961 --> 01:16:21,686
Sky Rink, rock concerts in Central Park,

1600
01:16:21,686 --> 01:16:22,966
roller blading at the pier.

1601
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:24,064
(chuckling)

1602
01:16:24,064 --> 01:16:25,228
Actually that's kind of fun.

1603
01:16:25,228 --> 01:16:27,347
- Yeah?
- Have you ever done it?

1604
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:30,232
- Uh no, no, can't say that I have.

1605
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:32,691
- What do you do for fun?

1606
01:16:32,691 --> 01:16:36,325
- Well actually, my
brokerage house is having

1607
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:39,291
an investment planning
dinner on Tuesday night.

1608
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:42,874
And I thought that
maybe you might join me.

1609
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:47,387
There'll be plenty of time to network.

1610
01:16:47,387 --> 01:16:49,054
- To network.
- Yeah.

1611
01:16:50,331 --> 01:16:53,664
- Um, actually Dudley I have to decline.

1612
01:16:54,603 --> 01:16:56,588
Thank you though.

1613
01:16:56,588 --> 01:16:59,474
Sounds like fun (chuckles).

1614
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:01,487
- That's a silk tie!

1615
01:17:01,487 --> 01:17:03,654
- I'm sorry.
- That stains!

1616
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:06,450
- I'm sorry.

1617
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:09,083
(bagpipes droning)

1618
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,000
- No, no, in a minute, in a minute.

1619
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:16,266
- Laura, I have big news for you!

1620
01:17:16,266 --> 01:17:18,892
- Yes I heard, congratulations.

1621
01:17:18,892 --> 01:17:22,550
- You heard I'm quitting the firm?

1622
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,383
- What?

1623
01:17:24,368 --> 01:17:27,485
(guests chattering)
(cans clattering)

1624
01:17:27,485 --> 01:17:29,048
- That's awfully fast, but it's up to you,

1625
01:17:29,048 --> 01:17:30,187
that's fine with me precious,

1626
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,208
(Laura chuckling)
it's your call!

1627
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,958
- Well no I called...

1628
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:36,353
- Jeff!

1629
01:17:36,353 --> 01:17:37,521
Audra loved you,

1630
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:39,431
if you've got her vote
you've got the board,

1631
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:40,900
you're a shoe-in.

1632
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,650
Here let me help you.

1633
01:17:44,474 --> 01:17:46,800
- Laura!
- I don't believe him!

1634
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,320
I wanted to make partner
since day one of the firm,

1635
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,403
and my last obstacle just evaporated.

1636
01:17:53,626 --> 01:17:56,387
- So you got it?
- I think I will.

1637
01:17:56,387 --> 01:17:58,059
- Oh Laura!
(laughing)

1638
01:17:58,059 --> 01:17:59,726
That's really great.

1639
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:02,226
- Life happens!

1640
01:18:02,226 --> 01:18:05,508
You know you can plan,
and plan and plan, and,

1641
01:18:05,508 --> 01:18:06,944
life just happens.

1642
01:18:06,944 --> 01:18:08,684
- There's another song.

1643
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,288
(chuckles) I don't
believe it Ron was right,

1644
01:18:10,288 --> 01:18:12,317
my family's my material!

1645
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:14,769
I'm sitting on a gold mine here!

1646
01:18:14,769 --> 01:18:16,124
Ron says the song I wrote last night

1647
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:17,691
is one of my best songs,
and it's all about

1648
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:21,051
you and Jeff and how much he misses you.

1649
01:18:21,051 --> 01:18:23,218
- Mm, he misses me?
- Yeah!

1650
01:18:25,212 --> 01:18:29,379
- Come on, everybody, it's
time for Dad's favorite jig!

1651
01:18:31,136 --> 01:18:34,054
(bagpipes blaring)

1652
01:18:34,054 --> 01:18:37,471
(festive Scottish music)

1653
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:53,065
- Yahoo!

1654
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:08,118
(ominous music)

1655
01:19:09,731 --> 01:19:10,564
Martha?

1656
01:19:12,193 --> 01:19:13,652
Martha!

1657
01:19:13,652 --> 01:19:15,423
Martha are you there?

1658
01:19:15,423 --> 01:19:16,943
- I'm here.

1659
01:19:16,943 --> 01:19:17,943
It's Martha.

1660
01:19:21,763 --> 01:19:24,430
(festive music)

1661
01:19:35,328 --> 01:19:38,911
(cheerfully festive music)

1662
01:19:44,995 --> 01:19:47,745
(Laura laughing)

1663
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:50,315
(coals hissing)

1664
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:52,867
♫ A gesture beats the sound of

1665
01:19:52,867 --> 01:19:57,496
♫ Please your heart again (mumbles)

1666
01:19:57,496 --> 01:20:01,663
♫ I'm playing second fiddle
to your cordless phone

1667
01:20:07,211 --> 01:20:11,378
♫ I'm playing second fiddle
to your cordless phone

1668
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:16,940
♫ Even when you're home I still feel alone

1669
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:19,456
♫ And those contracts
and those spreadsheets

1670
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,116
♫ Are cluttering our bedsheets

1671
01:20:22,116 --> 01:20:25,699
♫ I can barely hold my own

1672
01:20:26,929 --> 01:20:31,096
♫ I'm playing second fiddle
to your cordless phone

1673
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:39,004
♫ I'm playing

1674
01:20:39,004 --> 01:20:41,306
♫ Second fiddle

1675
01:20:41,306 --> 01:20:44,650
♫ To your cordless phone

1676
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:47,400
(poignant music)

1677
01:20:58,417 --> 01:20:59,667
- [Jeff] Laura?

1678
01:21:01,105 --> 01:21:02,605
- I hate bagpipes.

1679
01:21:05,602 --> 01:21:07,265
- Me too.

1680
01:21:07,265 --> 01:21:09,932
- That's okay, Grandpa loved it.

1681
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:12,623
- You look great.

1682
01:21:13,847 --> 01:21:15,194
- Thank you.

1683
01:21:15,194 --> 01:21:16,861
- I bet you're cold.

1684
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,182
I saw you talking to Eric.

1685
01:21:24,182 --> 01:21:25,636
He told me his news.

1686
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:28,287
(chuckling)
- Lucked out, didn't I?

1687
01:21:28,287 --> 01:21:30,706
I have to call Robin.

1688
01:21:30,706 --> 01:21:34,296
- Hey Robin!
(chuckling)

1689
01:21:34,296 --> 01:21:36,535
Now who says I can't communicate?

1690
01:21:36,535 --> 01:21:39,616
- Jeff I don't blame you
for being fed up with me.

1691
01:21:39,616 --> 01:21:40,903
I haven't been there for long--

1692
01:21:40,903 --> 01:21:42,900
- No no no, no no no,
it's not all your fault!

1693
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,009
I'm uncommunicative.

1694
01:21:45,009 --> 01:21:48,509
- (chuckles) You're uncommunicative
and I'm self absorbed.

1695
01:21:48,509 --> 01:21:49,676
Perfect match.

1696
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:53,416
What are we gonna do?

1697
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:55,990
(distant train whistle blowing)

1698
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:57,775
- [Both] I could commute?

1699
01:21:57,775 --> 01:22:00,025
(laughing)

1700
01:22:01,382 --> 01:22:03,222
- [Both] Okay you commute.

1701
01:22:03,222 --> 01:22:04,055
- Oh...

1702
01:22:06,303 --> 01:22:09,303
(telephone beeping)

1703
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:12,949
- Go ahead, take the call.

1704
01:22:13,982 --> 01:22:14,815
It's okay.

1705
01:22:14,815 --> 01:22:16,898
I don't want to stop you.

1706
01:22:20,138 --> 01:22:21,481
(water splashing)

1707
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:25,166

1709
01:22:27,095 --> 01:22:29,345
(laughing)

1710
01:22:36,512 --> 01:22:40,429
♫ Put our arms around me honey

1711
01:22:43,138 --> 01:22:45,805
♫ Hold me tight

1712
01:22:48,515 --> 01:22:51,289
♫ Close me up

1713
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:54,206
♫ Inside your arms

1714
01:22:55,743 --> 01:22:59,076
♫ All through the night

1715
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:03,722
♫ Here near

1716
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,260
♫ The one that I adore

1717
01:23:13,472 --> 01:23:15,889
♫ It's clear

1718
01:23:19,108 --> 01:23:22,441
♫ What the night is for

1719
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:27,977
♫ Let the world go by

1720
01:23:28,848 --> 01:23:32,348
♫ And never slow its pace

1721
01:23:36,153 --> 01:23:39,236
♫ I found all I need

1722
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,807
♫ Inside your sweet embrace

1723
01:23:47,066 --> 01:23:49,149
♫ Oh, oh

1724
01:23:50,888 --> 01:23:53,471
♫ I never knew

1725
01:23:56,309 --> 01:23:58,392
♫ Anyone

1726
01:24:01,753 --> 01:24:04,253
♫ Oh like you

1727
01:24:17,879 --> 01:24:20,420
♫ Put your arms around
me honey, hold me tight

1728
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:21,378
♫ Hold me tight

1729
01:24:21,378 --> 01:24:24,944
♫ Huddle up and cuddle
up with all your might

1730
01:24:24,944 --> 01:24:28,566
♫ Oh, oh, won't you roll them eyes

1731
01:24:28,566 --> 01:24:32,148
♫ Eyes that I just idolize

1732
01:24:32,148 --> 01:24:35,645
♫ When they look at me,
my heart begins to float

1733
01:24:35,645 --> 01:24:39,338
♫ Then it starts
a-rockin' like a motorboat

1734
01:24:39,338 --> 01:24:43,302
♫ Oooh-oooh, I never knew any

1735
01:24:43,302 --> 01:24:46,320
♫ Boy like you

1736
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,487
(bawdy ragtime music)

1737
01:25:15,232 --> 01:25:18,740
♫ Put your arms around
me, honey, hold me tight

1738
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:22,337
♫ Huddle up and cuddle
up with all your might

1739
01:25:22,337 --> 01:25:25,106
♫ Oh, oh, oh oh, won't you roll them eyes

1740
01:25:25,106 --> 01:25:26,064
♫ Roll them eyes

1741
01:25:26,064 --> 01:25:27,672
♫ Eyes that i just idolize

1742
01:25:27,672 --> 01:25:29,305
♫ I just idolize

1743
01:25:29,305 --> 01:25:33,138
♫ When they look at me,
my heart begins to float

1744
01:25:33,138 --> 01:25:36,822
♫ Then it stars a-rockin' like a motorboat

♫ Oooh-oooh, I never knew any

1746

♫ Boy like

1747
01:25:43,978 --> 01:25:46,811
♫ You-ooo-ooo-ooo

1748
01:25:50,153 --> 01:25:54,320
♫ Oh I never knew anyone like you

1749
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,818
- [Narrator] When an ambitious attorney,

1750
01:26:12,818 --> 01:26:15,110
- Clifton called a
senior partners meeting.

1751
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:17,056
By tonight, you could be partner.

1752
01:26:17,056 --> 01:26:19,441
- [Narrator] and a
disillusioned TV producer,

1753
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:22,109

01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,454
- [Narrator] Come to a
crossroads in their marriage,
