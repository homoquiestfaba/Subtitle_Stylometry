1
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,524
(intense music)

2
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,154
(music drones)

3
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,644
(car engine roaring)

4
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,378
(car engine roars)

5
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,779
- [Driver] Where you heading?

6
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,080
- Ellington.

7
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,117
- Hop in. I'm going that
way, I'll give you a ride.

8
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,485
- Thanks.

9
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,407
- So what's your name?

10
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,342
- Ryan.

11
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,110
- Ryan, how are you
doing? The name's Jason.

12
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,846
So what brings you to Ellington?

13
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,416
- (indistinct)

14
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,917
- Come again?

15
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,653
- Oh you know, starting all
over. Forgetting the past.

16
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,690
- You sound like me.

17
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,426
- [Ryan] So how long have you been there?

18
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,627
- Three years.

19
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,962
- Really?

20
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,463
- Yeah?

21
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,032
- [Jason] So what is it that
you're really looking for?

22
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,302
- [Ryan] Well, just the basic stuff.

23
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,340
You know, a place to stay,

24
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,643
a job that pays more than minimum wage.

25
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,078
And a girlfriend.

26
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,714
- Now you really sound like me.

27
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,882
- So did you?

28
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,883
- Did I?

29
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,120
- Did you find what you were looking for?

30
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,457
- Well, got my own place.

31
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,860
I share it with my
sister and my girlfriend.

32
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,496
Got a pretty good job.

33
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,399
Have a terrific girlfriend.

34
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,234
So, yeah I have to say

35
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,970
I did find everything I was looking for.

36
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,207
- So honestly, Jason,

37
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,443
what are the chances of me
finding a motel room tonight?

38
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,445
- Slim to none.

39
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,481
They're having a big convention downtown.

40
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,916
Everything's going to be
packed for a few days.

41
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:45,917
- Great.

42
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,253
- You don't know anybody in LA

43
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,022
you can stay with for a couple of days?

44
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,324
- Not so.

45
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,695
- Well, I could let you crash
at my place if you don't mind

46
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,197
for a couple days.

47
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,200
- [Ryan] I really don't
want to be a bother.

48
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,168
- Listen,

49
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,872
I was in your shoes once
before three years ago.

50
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,640
I can't just let you stay on the streets.

51
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,742
I know what it's like.

52
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,012
- I really appreciate it.

53
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,149
- You probably won't
thank me after a few days.

54
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,651
You know what it's like
living with two girls?

55
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,054
Hope you don't need to use the bathroom.

56
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,356
(laughing)

57
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,959
(eerie music)

58
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,526
- Well, that's a pretty
wild time in your life.

59
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,296
- Yeah I gotta admit it's pretty crazy.

60
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,498
But your life doesn't seem
that difficult either.

61
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,333
- Yeah.

62
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,202
I got a pretty wild imagination.

63
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,439
- Jason, you ever just think about

64
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,441
strange things?

65
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,044
- Just out of nowhere?

66
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,913
- Yeah.

67
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,251
Like when we were kids,
we had this neighbor,

68
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,921
we used to cut across his
backyard on our way to school.

69
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,591
I mean, this guy was a real dickhead.

70
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,826
He used to come out of his
house every day and yell at us,

71
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,530
screaming at the top of his
lungs, chasing us off his yard.

72
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:42,401
But we didn't care. We used
to do it every morning.

73
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,402
So finally,

74
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:48,106
you know, we got tired of
this old man yelling at us.

75
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,442
We said we'd get him back.

76
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,978
We got this paper bag.

77
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,213
Not like some lunch bag,

78
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,582
I'm talking like a wig
Safeway shopping bag.

79
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:58,918
And we shit in it.

80
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,921
All of us took turns shitting
in it until it was full.

81
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,291
I mean God damn. This thing stunk so bad.

82
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,161
We got it, we tied up really tight,

83
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,530
and we went up to his front door,

84
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,132
set it right there on the porch.

85
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,768
We soaked it in lighter fluid.

86
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,740
And we rang the doorbell. We
rang it, rang it, mad times.

87
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,610
We lit on fire, and took off running.

88
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,479
You know,

89
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,979
not far enough away where we
can't see what's happening.

90
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,815
Just far enough

91
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,917
where he wouldn't see us
when he came out the door.

92
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,121
And he came out the door and
saw the fire on his doorstep.

93
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,057
So he tried to stomp fire out.

94
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,826
He went, "Oh shit,"

95
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:45,263
when he realized he was knee-deep in shit,

96
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,066
trying to put the fire out.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,402
It was so funny.

98
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,138
I know he suspected it was us

99
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,640
because from that point on,

100
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,844
he never messed with us ever again.

101
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,814
- And?

102
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,816
- And, you know, it was funny cause

103
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,718
you know, he came out and-

104
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,553
- Yeah.

105
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,155
Oo, pretty bad.

106
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,524
- And you've done something worse.

107
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,995
- Well, actually Jason, I have.

108
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,798
I had a pretty mean neighbor too.

109
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,000
A real cocksucker.

110
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,035
But even worse than him was his dog.

111
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,537
Oh my God.

112
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,839
That dog was so bad.

113
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,107
It was the meanest,

114
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,110
scariest son of a bitch you ever did see.

115
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,578
It was huge.

116
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,146
I don't even know what kind of dog it was.

117
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,348
The thing was,

118
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,350
I think it was part breed,

119
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,253
like big-as-hell and scary-as-shit.

120
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,956
Well, one day I just got tired of him

121
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,558
always chasing me.

122
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,860
So I saw him sleeping there,

123
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,396
I had it all planned out.

124
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
So I crept up real slowly on the dog,

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,635
Took me 20 minutes.

126
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,836
Well, I got there,

127
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,139
I had this water-
- Water balloon?

128
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,508
- Yeah. And it gets better.

129
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,744
It's full of gas.

130
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,247
So I huck it at this dog and
it hits him right in the face.

131
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,217
Dog wakes up automatically. Oh my God.

132
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,251
She doesn't see me.

133
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,354
It was strange. It never ran,

134
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,522
like trying to get me.

135
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,723
It just

136
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:23,128
shook its head back and forth
and repeated this really

137
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,830
God-awful sound.

138
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,700
It started having seizures.

139
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,603
I started to feel bad. Like
maybe I did something wrong,

140
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,206
but I kept my cool and I
threw the match anyway.

141
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,042
- Fuck.

142
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,509
- Yeah. And the dog caught on fire.

143
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,678
Just like I imagined it would.

144
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,314
But what I did not imagine,
is that he is running,

145
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,684
catching everything on
fire. Caught a bush on fire.

146
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,686
I got so scared. I just ran.

147
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,187
I ran, and I ran.

148
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:53,425
Pretty soon I started hearing
like whistles and sirens.

149
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,529
Well like 10 fire trucks showed
up with a bunch of police.

150
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,865
The whole damn town was
there for just one dog.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
So,

152
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,203
I thought I'd won and everything,

153
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,207
but I had to go back.

154
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,777
I went back just to see.

155
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,912
When I went there,

156
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,916
I saw the charred remains of the dog.

157
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,186
- You're a sick bastard.

158
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,021
- Sick?

159
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,855
Why do you say that?

160
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,090
I mean, I just want to
put a hurt on that dog.

161
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,959
I mean, I didn't mean for
the bush to catch on fire.

162
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,996
I mean the dog deserved it.

163
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,199
It bit a kid a week
before that. A little kid.

164
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,868
Kid had to get stitches, about 20 of them.

165
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,903
Left a big scar.

166
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,972
Don't act like you've
never done anything violent

167
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,973
in your life.

168
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,143
- Yeah.

169
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,410
- Yeah, see?

170
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,612
So tell me what was the most violent thing

171
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,148
you've ever done in your life?

172
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,219
- Well, you haven't met my little sister.

173
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,220
I'm sure you will.

174
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,422
But, I love her. I love her to death.

175
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,458
She's like the greatest
thing in the world.

176
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,062
And there was this guy,
he was a real loser.

177
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,532
He kept trying to get
her to go out with him.

178
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,868
She didn't want anything to do with him,

179
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,538
but he wouldn't give up.
He kept asking, and asking.

180
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,407
And I don't know, maybe
she felt sorry for him.

181
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,308
I don't know.

182
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,411
But she agreed to go
out with him one night.

183
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,347
Well, he tried to rape her.

184
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,916
And when I found out, I was so pissed.

185
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,920
I hunted him down and I
beat the shit out of him.

186
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,189
I just kept hitting him, and hitting him.

187
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,190
You know,

188
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,325
he quit fighting, he quit moving,

189
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,760
and I just kept hitting
him right in the face.

190
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,463
I just kept hitting him, and
hitting him, and hitting him.

191
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,964
God, he was a mess when I was done.

192
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,066
- Did you kill him?

193
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,535
- I wanted to,

194
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,107
but I don't know what happened, you know?

195
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,310
He moved out of town and
I never saw him again.

196
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,646
I don't regret doing it.

197
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,883
I do anything to protect my little sister.

198
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,719
(ominous music)

199
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,719
- Would you kill for her?

200
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,921
- I suppose.

201
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,157
If I had to do it to protect her.

202
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,094
- Do you know what it's
like to kill someone?

203
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,429
- No, and I suppose you do?

204
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,898
- Well, yeah.

205
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,101
- Bullshit.

206
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,704
- No, I'm serious.

207
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,872
I've killed someone.

208
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,508
- Yeah, like in a war or something?

209
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,509
- Oh, no.

210
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,377
Just this guy.

211
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,347
I wanted to and

212
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,382
well, he was there.

213
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,419
I took the rope and I just did it.

214
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,722
- Wait a minute.

215
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,257
Wait a minute.

216
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,227
We both had a little too much to drink

217
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,765
and we've told some pretty tall tales.

218
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,633
I think it's time to go to bed.

219
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,169
'Cause you got to be
shitting me on this one.

220
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,404
- No, no, no, no, no, I can prove it.

221
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,407
- How can you prove something like that?

222
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,447
What have you got there?

223
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,916
- You got a VCR?

224
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,323
- [Ryan] I think you're
going to enjoy this.

225
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,200
- Ryan, what are you doing?

226
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,437
Ryan, what's wrong?

227
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,673
You can talk to me, I'm your friend.

228
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,075
- Ryan-

229
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,477
Oh Ry-

230
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,147
(choking on TV)

231
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,993
- [Ryan] Pretty good, isn't it?

232
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,454
- [Jason] Yeah, that was pretty good.

233
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,655
That kid's a good actor.

234
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,757
- You think I faked that?

235
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,758
- Yeah.

236
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,694
You mean,

237
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,962
you're trying to tell you
actually killed that kid?

238
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,197
- Yeah. The guy was a real bastard.

239
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,699
What he did was a hell of a lot worse

240
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,100
than what they guy you told me about

241
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,236
tried to do to your sister.

242
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,938
- What could he have possibly done to-?

243
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,206
Nevermind, that was fake anyways.

244
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,207
I don't even believe it.

245
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,609
- I'm telling you.

246
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,811
I really killed the guy.

247
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:40,812
- Kylie.

248
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,747
- Hey, what's going on?

249
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,749
- I'm sorry. Did we wake you?

250
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,551
This is Ryan.

251
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,086
That's my sister, Kylie.

252
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,988
Kylie, he's going to stay
here for a couple of nights.

253
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,257
He's kind of stuck for a
place to stay, so I told him

254
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,359
he crash here if he wanted to.

255
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,327
- Nice to meet you, Ryan.

256
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,830
I'll see you guys in the morning.

257
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,035
- Man is that your sister?

258
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,038
Hot damn, she is fine.

259
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,072
- Yeah, she-

260
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,241
Hey, don't be getting any ideas,

261
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,110
she's got a boyfriend.

262
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,111
- Oh, yeah?

263
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,782
- Well I'm going to hit the rock.

264
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,617
You can go ahead

265
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,817
and crash right there on
the couch if you want,

266
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,219
and I'll see you in the morning.

267
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
- Hey Jason.

268
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,389
Thanks again, I really appreciate this.

269
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,292
- Hey, no problem, man.

270
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,110
(bright, droning music)

271
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,449
(birds chirping)

272
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,392
(shower running)

273
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,482
(creepy music)

274
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,689
- Julie?

275
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,273
(water stops)

276
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,724
- [Jason] Hey, morning, do
you want a cup of coffee?

277
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,859
Hope that couch wasn't too
uncomfortable for you last night.

278
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,462
- Oh no, it was fine, thanks.

279
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,502
- There you go.

280
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,669
You can go ahead and have a seat out there

281
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,139
in the dining room.

282
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,017
- Morning Jason.

283
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,984
- Oh morning, Sweetie.

284
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,618
Hey hon, this is Ryan.

285
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,020
He didn't have a place to stay last night,

286
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,321
so I told him he could crash at our place

287
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,090
for a couple of days
until some motels open up.

288
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:53,926
- Hi.

289
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,059
- Hello.

290
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,127
- Well I'd love to stay and chat,

291
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,062
but I'm running late for work as it is.

292
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,931
- All right. Well, I'll
see when you get home then.

293
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,766
- Okay, love you.

294
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,766
- Love you too.

295
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,136
Hey Kylie, sorry I woke you up last night.

296
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,171
- Oh that's okay, I fell
right back to sleep.

297
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,606
- [Ryan] Hello again.

298
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,508
- Hi. Ryan, right?

299
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,609
- Yeah.

300
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,311
(knocking)

301
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,312
Come in.

302
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:20,819
- What's up Jason?

303
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:21,653
- [Jason] Oh, not much.

304
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,120
Hey Ryan, this is Rick.

305
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,488
Rick, Ryan.

306
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,556
- How's it going?

307
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,191
- Pretty good.

308
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,126
- Are you ready?

309
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,126
- Sure.

310
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,696
Bye.

311
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,530
- Take it easy, guys.

312
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,364
- [Jason] See you later.

313
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,631
- [Ryan] Nice meeting you.

314
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,099
- Listen, I need to get going to work too,

315
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,634
otherwise I'll be late.

316
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,635
- Okay.

317
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,504
- I'm going to give you the
key to my car out there.

318
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,475
She don't run too good, but beats walking.

319
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,410
Go ahead. Run around town,

320
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,612
try to find yourself hotel,

321
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,013
some place to stay tonight, all right?

322
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,114
- Hey thanks, I will.

323
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,916
- No problem. Just lock it
up before you leave, okay?

324
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,784
- Okay.

325
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,454
(ominous music)

326
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,143
- How about a cold one?

327
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,611
- I'm down for that.

328
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,114
- Going down pretty smooth tonight.

329
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,418
Told you you wouldn't have any any luck

330
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,321
trying to find a hotel tonight.
Not with that convention.

331
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,322
- You were right.

332
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,592
There was nothing.

333
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,394
Hey Jason, I just want to say thanks.

334
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,095
I mean, a lot of people

335
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,530
wouldn't even help a guy out like me.

336
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,699
Not even knowing me or anything.

337
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,702
- Hey, that's just the kind of guy I am.

338
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,471
- Jason?

339
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,574
You trust me, right?

340
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,610
- Yeah. I trust you.

341
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,679
I mean, you're a pretty cool guy.

342
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,816
Little crazy, but so am
I. But yeah, I trust you.

343
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,851
- Then why'd you call me a liar?

344
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,952
(ominous music)

345
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,922
- A liar? I never called you a liar.

346
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,191
- You said I faked it on the videotape.

347
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,327
- That's different. I mean,

348
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,363
it's not like you
actually killed that kid.

349
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,431
- Yes, I did.

350
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,969
- Let's not get into this again.

351
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,037
- No, I really did.

352
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,605
I can prove it to you.

353
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,442
- How are you going to prove at this time?

354
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,444
- Watch.

355
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,816
- Look, man...

356
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,516
- Holy shit, that's Matt.

357
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,452
That's the kid that works
over at the gas station.

358
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,953
What the hell are you going to him?

359
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,189
- [Ryan] Watch.

360
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:38,957
- What are you doing, man?

361
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,157
Get away from me, man.

362
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:40,992
Come on.

363
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:41,927
I'll give you the money, dude.

364
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,527
I'll open the safe, whatever you want.

365
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,097
Let me go. Let me go.

366
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,368
- You're not going to kill him, are you?

367
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,836
What are you doing?

368
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,270
- Just watch.

369
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,606
(coughing)

370
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,441
- I'll give you what you want,

371
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,908
just please don't kill me man.

372
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:58,909
Come on.

373
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,115
(choking)

374
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,444
- What the hell do you do that for? Why?

375
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,279
- To prove to you that I'm not a liar.

376
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,249
- What if somebody saw
you? Somebody saw my car?

377
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,651
- No one will find him.

378
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:41,652
And nobody saw me.

379
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,555
I put him someplace

380
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,690
special, you might say.

381
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,859
No one will ever find him.

382
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,228
- But don't you think
I'm going to turn you in?

383
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,397
- Seems to me it could have been you.

384
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,398
- [Jason] What?

385
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,801
- Didn't you notice that
I was wearing your shirt?

386
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,636
I was driving your car.

387
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,238
I don't know that guy from Jack.

388
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,607
But he was one of your friends, wasn't he?

389
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,042
- You think I'm not going
to tell somebody about this?

390
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,711
You just fucking killed somebody.

391
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,982
- If the police ever found out about this,

392
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,752
or found this video tape,

393
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,656
seems to be on the evidence
would be pointing towards you.

394
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,624
I gotta admit,

395
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,660
I left a little something out.

396
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,762
A little piece of evidence.

397
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,730
Something that might belong to you.

398
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,633
- What are you talking about?

399
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,101
- You're not going to tell
the police about this,

400
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,370
or anyone else for that matter.

401
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,805
Unless you want the same
thing to happen to you

402
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,108
or someone you care about.

403
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,177
- You're crazy.

404
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:41,745
- You think?

405
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,584
- So

406
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,053
I think the best thing would be

407
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,224
just keep your mouth shut about
his whole ordeal, don't you?

408
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,194
I thought you'd see it my way.

409
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,200
Besides, this could be fun.

410
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,668
I mean, you and me have a lot in common.

411
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,539
I could get used to staying here.

412
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,876
And I could get used to

413
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,110
Kylie.

414
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,182
Yeah, I could get used to this.

415
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,686
(droning music)

416
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,399
- Kylie.

417
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Kylie.

418
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,103
It's me, Kylie.

419
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,038
Kylie.

420
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,707
Kylie.

421
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,678
Come here, Kylie.

422
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,080
I won't hurt you.

423
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,549
It's me, Kylie.

424
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,517
Kylie.

425
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,752
Kylie.

426
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,757
Come here Kylie.

427
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,373
I will always have you, Kylie.

428
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:23,874
Always.

429
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,478
Always have you.

430
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,748
Always have you.

431
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,785
(gasping)

432
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,333
(balls clacking)

433
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,668
- Jason, what's up with Ryan?

434
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,936
I thought he was only going
to be here for a few days.

435
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,371
He's been here for two weeks now.

436
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,806
- He's looking for work.

437
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,708
- Looking for work?

438
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,742
Why isn't he looking for a place to stay?

439
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,577
- How is he supposed to pay for a place

440
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,145
when he doesn't even have any money?

441
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,813
- Why is that your problem?

442
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,448
- I just can't do that to somebody.

443
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,283
- Why not?

444
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,517
I mean, you don't owe him anything.

445
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,152
For God's sake, you
don't even know the man.

446
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,220
- Look, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

447
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,756
- Jason, there's something
not right about him.

448
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:13,692
(knocking)

449
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,060
I'll get it. It'll be Rick.

450
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,369
(balls clacking)

451
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,706
- Hi.

452
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,806
- Hey, what's going on?

453
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,575
- Oh not much, just downstairs
and we're playing pool.

454
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,510
- Everything okay?

455
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,446
- Well, he is still here.

456
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,448
- Want me to tell him to
get the hell out of here?

457
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,950
- No, that will just cause a
fight between him and Jason.

458
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,320
Besides, he will fight
to stay for some reason.

459
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,589
- Hey, you two.

460
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,827
Why don't you come back down?

461
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,163
- I'm just going to talk
to Rick for a minute, okay?

462
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,164
- Okay.

463
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,170
- See what I mean?

464
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,237
It's like it's his house

465
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,772
and we're the guests here or something.

466
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,906
Why don't you come stay
with me for a couple of days

467
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,808
and get out of here?

468
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,311
- I don't know, I just...

469
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,385
- [Jason] Hey Rick.

470
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,987
Yeah, he thinks he's some kind of

471
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,957
billiards pro or something.

472
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,792
- Hey guys,

473
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,193
I'm gonna stay at Rick's
for a couple of days, okay?

474
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,361
- [Ryan] Aw, come on now, Kylie.

475
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,464
You know how much you'll
be missed around here.

476
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,565
Want a drink?

477
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,033
- No thanks, I don't drink.

478
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,201
- [Ryan] Aw, come on, one won't kill you.

479
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,203
- She doesn't drink.

480
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,272
- [Ryan] Julie, how about you?

481
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,775
- [Julie] Sure, I'll have one.

482
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,643
- [Ryan] Jason, can I
hook you up with a drink?

483
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,045
- [Jason] Oh no thanks, bro.

484
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,413
- [Ryan] What about you, Rick?

485
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,948
- No, I don't drink either.

486
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,751
- [Ryan] Aw what a bunch of pansies.

487
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,187
- Hey Julie, guess who I saw today.

488
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,055
- [Julie] Who?

489
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:51,890
- [Kylie] Cara.

490
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,724
- [Julie] Who?

491
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,558
- [Kylie] Cara,

492
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:54,526
you know, runs the
restaurant down on fourth?

493
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,093
- [Julie] Oh yeah, how's she doing?

494
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:56,928
- Oh, she's doing good.

495
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,762
She happened to mention

496
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,330
that her head counter person just quit.

497
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,899
- Very subtle, Kylie.

498
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,801
- Excuse me?

499
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,402
- Why didn't you just
come right out and say it?

500
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,304
You want me to go down there

501
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,838
and apply for the job, don't you?

502
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,940
- Well, Ryan, you always say
there's nothing out there.

503
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,608
Here's an opportunity.

504
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,111
- Working for a restaurant
for minimum wage.

505
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,913
Yeah. I would just love that.

506
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:16,914
I don't think so.

507
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,649
- It's a job.

508
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,284
- Not what I want to do.

509
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,819
- [Jason] Kylie. Mom called the other day.

510
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,954
She said she's coming for a
visit in a couple of weeks.

511
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,989
- Well, I hope there's room for her.

512
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,492
- Hey, anybody want to play doubles?

513
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,493
- No, we're going to get going.

514
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,928
Do you want to get something to eat?

515
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,563
- Sure.

516
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,997
- Hey, I'm going to
stay with Rick tonight,

517
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,399
so don't wait up for me, okay?

518
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,234
- Okay.

519
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,234
- Hey Kylie.

520
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,436
Don't stay away too long.

521
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,873
Things won't be the same
around here without you.

522
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,978
(ominous music)

523
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,857
- Julie?

524
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,261
- What?

525
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:04,629
- Are you mad at me or something?

526
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,598
- Jason, how can you be so stupid

527
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,299
as to not see what's going on?

528
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
- What?

529
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,136
- How can you be so blind?

530
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,872
- What are you talking about?

531
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,573
- When is he going to leave?

532
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,575
- Oh, you mean Ryan?

533
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,476
- What was going through your head

534
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,111
when you brought him here, anyway?

535
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,080
- I was just trying to help the guy out.

536
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,414
- And what are you doing now?

537
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,983
Still helping him out?

538
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,451
When are you going to
be the man of the house

539
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,452
and kick him out?

540
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,954
Can't you see what's going on?

541
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:34,057
How he's affecting us? And Kylie.

542
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,360
She can't do anything
without him being up her ass.

543
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,494
He wants to do this for her,

544
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,897
he wants to do that for her.

545
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,399
Can't you see what's going on?

546
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,002
- I think you're just overreacting.

547
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,871
- No, I'm not.

548
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,410
It's like he's taking control
of your life, our lives.

549
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,113
You used to watch out for Kylie and me.

550
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,349
And now it's like, you've
picked him over us.

551
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:00,852
- That's ridiculous.

552
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,522
- No, it's not.

553
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,126
You've changed. He's
taken charge of your life.

554
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,894
Of our lives.

555
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,029
- Will you shut up?

556
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,131
I'm not picking him over anybody.

557
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,934
I'm just trying to help the guy out.

558
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,041
- Jason, will you just listen to yourself?

559
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,210
You'd never raised your
voice to me before.

560
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,579
Just think about it, Jason.

561
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,982
Something's going on
here and it's not right.

562
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,483
You've changed.

563
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:36,754
And whether or not you want
to admit it, he's changed you.

564
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,183
- Hey, what's up man?

565
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:08,352
- Hey, not much. Went
out looking for a job.

566
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,353
- Any luck?

567
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,789
- Man, there ain't nothing in this town.

568
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,259
- Tell me about it. Took
me forever to find a job.

569
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,428
- So what's up with Kylie?

570
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,596
- What do you mean?

571
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,499
- I mean, every time I go
to do something with her,

572
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,135
she seems so mad at me.

573
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,471
- Oh, you know girls.

574
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,139
- Yeah.

575
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,375
Jason,

576
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,445
I really like your sister.

577
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,646
I mean, I really like her.

578
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,149
I mean, I know she has
a boyfriend and all,

579
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,586
but I just like being around her.

580
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,355
I want to take her out
on a date some time.

581
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,759
Just me and her to dinner
and a movie or something.

582
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,927
Just a little something that's fun.

583
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,596
Have a good night out on the town.

584
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,097
- Man, you know she's got a boyfriend.

585
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,333
She really loves Rick.

586
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:57,869
They've been going out for a long time,

587
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,902
I don't think she's going to do it...

588
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,240
- Look, I want you to tell
her to take me up on my offer.

589
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,610
Nothing's going to happen to her.

590
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,378
No one will come near her.

591
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,379
I'll protect her.

592
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,420
Look,

593
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,721
just a little something.

594
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,190
Just me and her, a night on the town.

595
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,191
Nothing big.

596
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,995
She might have fun. You never know.

597
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,798
I mean, she might even get
second thoughts about Rick.

598
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,934
I mean, you know, how
much of a jerk he is.

599
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,236
Joke.

600
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,837
Come on.

601
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,906
But it's true enough.

602
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,843
I joke again.

603
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,349
- All right. I'll talk to her.

604
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,052
But I can't guarantee anything.

605
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,889
But I'll talk to her for you.

606
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,860
But you gotta do something for me.

607
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:57,861
- Name it.

608
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,434
- Well, you're gonna-

609
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,602
- You want me to leave.

610
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,437
- No.

611
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,604
- Yes.

612
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,809
Look, I know the girls knew
anyway, it's your place, man.

613
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,911
You're just so kind for
trying to help me out.

614
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,446
You said I could stay for a couple of days

615
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,448
and here it's been a couple of weeks.

616
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,350
Look,

617
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,451
you hook me up with your sister,

618
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,387
the next day, I'm going. Promise.

619
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,224
- All right, then. I'll call her.

620
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,592
I'll talk to her.

621
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,593
- Thanks.

622
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,435
Hey Jason.

623
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,302
- Yeah?

624
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,669
- You still trust me don't you?

625
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,670
- Sure.

626
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,073
- Look, I swear,

627
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,108
give me a night on the
town with your sister,

628
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,610
the next day, I'm history.

629
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,679
- All right. It's a deal.

630
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,987
(eerie music)

631
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:04,161
(phone ringing)

632
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,297
- TradingView Video. Can I help you?

633
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,632
Jason.

634
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:09,667
How you doing?

635
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,135
Well, great.

636
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,773
Yeah, hold on. She just walked in.

637
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,110
It's Jason.

638
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,578
- Jason, what's up?

639
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,413
- Kylie, you gotta do me a favor.

640
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,714
All right? I talked to Ryan.

641
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,683
He said he's going to leave,

642
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,385
but he wants to take you on a date first.

643
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,853
Otherwise he won't.

644
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,854
- What?

645
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,955
No way.

646
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:32,989
- [Jason On Phone] Listen, he said

647
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,925
he just wants to go out to a movie

648
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:36,693
or out to dinner or
something. Just as friends.

649
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,528
- No.

650
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,096
Why should I have to go out
with him if I don't want to?

651
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,298
- Come on, you gotta,

652
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,999
you gotta do this for me. All right?

653
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,668
Do you want him to leave or not?

654
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,735
- Yeah, I want him to leave,

655
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,471
but what's him leaving have to do with me?

656
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,539
- There's gonna be all
kinds of people there.

657
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,074
What's the big deal?

658
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,343
- That's not the point. The
point is I don't want to,

659
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,645
and you can't make me.

660
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,114
- Kylie, what's going on?

661
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,616
- There's this guy staying with us

662
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,685
and it was only supposed
to be for a few days,

663
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,486
but now he won't leave.

664
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,189
And he keeps looking at me. He scares me.

665
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,891
- What guy? Who is he?

666
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,460
- Just some hitchhiker my
dumb brother picked up.

667
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,561
- What?

668
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,463
Listen to me.

669
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,731
You don't have to do anything
that you don't want to do.

670
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,734
If you don't want to go
out with this guy, don't.

671
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,135
Besides what about Rick?

672
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,338
Doesn't he have anything
to say about that?

673
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,306
- Oh my God. There he is.

674
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,610
- Look, go to the back
room. I'll talk to him.

675
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,279
Can I help you?

676
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,946
- Oh, I'm just a friend of Kylie's.

677
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,781
- She's-

678
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:31,915
Kylie's really busy right now.

679
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,917
- Won't keep her but a minute.

680
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,720
- I really don't think she
wants to talk to you right now.

681
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,622
- And I really don't think
it's any of your business.

682
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,626
- Well I'm making it my business.
I think you better leave.

683
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,925
- You're going to be all right?

684
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,860
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

685
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:17,695
- Come on, I'll walk you to your car.

686
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:18,695
- Okay.

687
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:32,042
- Listen, if you guys need
anything, you know my number.

688
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,510
- You're so sweet.

689
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,844
- What can I say?

690
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:35,713
- No, but really Steve.

691
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:38,615
I really appreciate what you
did for me in there tonight.

692
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,150
- Promise to call if you need anything?

693
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,985
- I promise.

694
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,352
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

695
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,353
- Yeah, see you.

696
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,497
(creepy music)

697
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,051
(choking)

698
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:32,503
- You should mind your own
business, shouldn't you, asshole?

699
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,428
There you go.

700
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,829
You would have been a good boy.

701
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,835
You wouldn't have had to
worry about protecting her.

702
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,255
- Rick?

703
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,524
What are you doing here?

704
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,192
Where is everyone?

705
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,095
- First of all, I don't
need a reason to be here

706
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,063
except that my girlfriend lives here.

707
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,599
And second of all, I don't
know where everybody is.

708
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,501
Kylie hasn't come home yet.

709
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,336
And if she doesn't come home soon,

710
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,304
I'm going to go looking for her.

711
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,839
But while you're here,
why don't you take a seat?

712
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
We need to talk.

713
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
- So talk.

714
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,083
- I want to know what
the hell is going on.

715
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,151
- With what?

716
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,620
- With you. You know
Kylie and I are dating

717
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,489
and are probably going to get married.

718
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,757
But you keep,

719
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,060
you keep going after her.
So what's wrong with you?

720
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,630
She doesn't like you. And
matter of fact, she hates you.

721
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,600
So why don't you just stay away from her?

722
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,968
We love each other very much.

723
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,571
So why don't you just stay away?

724
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,673
Take the hint.

725
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,477
- She never told me that.

726
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,812
You know, I think she
wants to date other guys,

727
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,882
but you won't let her.
All she knows is you,

728
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,150
you won't let her see
that there's a lot more

729
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,686
that the world has to
offer besides just you.

730
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,256
A little red neck, little town, boy.

731
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,160
- Look, Ryan,

732
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,661
you seem like a nice guy and
I don't think there should be

733
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,662
more problems.

734
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,734
Am I right?

735
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,872
I think it'd be best if you
just packed your bags and well,

736
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:49,707
and just left.

737
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,443
(dramatic music)

738
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,700
- What's wrong with you?

739
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,469
- What do you mean?

740
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,070
- You're psycho.

741
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,605
- Psycho.

742
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,208
I guess you should stop me then.

743
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,380
That was okay.

744
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,949
Let's see if you can take mine.

745
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,859
- Man, what's your problem? Just back off.

746
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,694
- Back off?

747
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:44,695
- Yeah.

748
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:46,029
- Hm,

749
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,731
You're right. Definitely back off.

750
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,573
(grunting)

751
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,031
(creepy music)

752
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,323
- Hello?

753
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,030
Anybody home?

754
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,219
- [Julie] Kylie?

755
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,331
(music intensifies)

756
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,302
(muffled screaming)

757
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,277
- Julie? Kylie?

758
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:09,613
Anybody home?

759
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,784
Where the hell is everyone?

760
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,524
(bag unzips)

761
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,767
(choking)

762
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,461
(muffled screaming)

763
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,430
- See what I did to your friends, huh?

764
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,931
You want some of that?

765
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:36,932
Oh, yeah.

766
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,137
(screaming)

767
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,738
- No!

768
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:43,573
No!

769
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:44,907
- Shut up!

770
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:45,908
- No!

771
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,736
- That sick motherfucker.

772
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,505
(indistinct shouting)

773
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,341
- How many people did he kill?

774
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,709
(grunting)

775
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,245
- Please just let me go.

776
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,148
- Yeah, I can't do that. You know why.

777
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,718
- I'll do anything.

778
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,821
- Look, I really don't see
what the problem here is.

779
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,356
I mean, we all die sometime.

780
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,193
- Please I'll do anything. Anything.

781
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,495
I won't tell anyone.

782
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,868
- You know, maybe I
should just let you go.

783
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,084
(screaming)

784
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,301
- Holy shit.

785
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:44,126
- What are you doing with me Ryan?!

786
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:47,129
Oh God, what are you doing?!

787
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,464
No!

788
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,465
No!

789
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,536
(screaming)

790
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,512
- What are you doing?!

791
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,849
(screaming)

792
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:15,090
(indistinct crying)

793
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:17,927
- [Ryan On TV] You taste
as good as you smell.

794
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,795
(screaming)

795
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:20,796
- No!

796
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:21,731
Get back!

797
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,067
(screaming)

798
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,485
- What are you doing?

799
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,321
- Oh my God!

800
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,288
Julie!

801
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:50,293
Julie!

802
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:05,007
(music intensifies)

803
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,409
(choking)

804
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,646
(grunting)

805
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,759
- Son of a bitch!

806
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,996
(grunting)

807
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,835
- I will fucking kill you.

808
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:35,105
(grunting)

809
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,107
(gunshot)

810
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,844
(Jason groaning)

811
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:50,487
- I guess I can't find here

812
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:53,255
everything I was looking for, huh?

813
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,425
(gunshot)

814
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,801
- Well, now we can be together.

815
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,102
I mean everything that
was in our way before

816
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,103
is now not.

817
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,739
I won't hear anybody say anything now,

818
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,740
right?

819
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,981
I think we have their approval.

820
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,320
- Why are you doing this?

821
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,321
- Why?

822
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,923
So we can be together.

823
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,425
Just like it was meant to be.

824
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,526
Because I love you.

825
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,660
- You're crazy.

826
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,262
- Crazy?

827
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,264
Crazy for you.

828
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,267
Crazy cause I love you.

829
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,802
- [Kylie] I don't love you!

830
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:40,737
I hate you!

831
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:41,705
You make me sick!

832
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,639
- Hey, don't say such silly things!

833
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,140
- Help me!

834
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:46,141
- Shut up.

835
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,010
Shut the fuck up, you stupid bitch.

836
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,611
Can't you see that I love you?

837
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,214
No, you can't see it. You want Rick.

838
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,249
Just like Mary wanted Peter.

839
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,052
Just like Cara wanted Chris.

840
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,722
You want Rick over me, huh?

841
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,623
Well, it's a good thing.

842
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:02,891
Tell you what,

843
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,460
I'll take you to him now.

844
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,495
Aw, don't cry.

845
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,465
Close your eyes and say good night.

846
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,735
Because it's the last thing
you'll ever say in this world.

847
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:13,670
(sobbing)

848
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:15,170
(screaming)

849
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,340
(gunshot)

850
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:26,249
(ground crunching)

851
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:44,867
- Need a lift?

852
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,169
- Uh yeah, sure.

853
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,573
(music intensifies)

854
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,520
- [Driver] Where you headed?

855
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,655
- [Ryan] Oregon.

856
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,358
- So what are you headed to Oregon for?

857
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,860
- A new beginning.

858
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,311
(music drones)
