1
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:10,172
(relaxed ensemble music)

2
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:11,441
(relaxed ensemble music)

3
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:52,345
(anxious ensemble tones)

4
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,303
- Welcome to Windgate State Penitentiary.

5
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,393
Well, how does it feel to be behind bars?

6
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:11,930
(media members laughing)

7
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,330
If you members of the
media follow all the rules,

8
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,530
we'll even let you go
at the end of the day.

9
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,630
As the Director of the
Department of Corrections,

10
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,380
I've been making some changes here.

11
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:30,093
- You want some?

12
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:32,510
(chattering)

13
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,260
- [Prisoner] You guys can't do this to me.

14
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,630
Come on.

15
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,530
- Now I don't believe in
wasting taxpayer's dollars

16
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,220
on fancy frills I can tell
you but my plan for self-

17
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,330
contained housing units is
turning Windgate into the most

18
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,426
efficient and secure penal
institution in the country.

19
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,676
(groaning)

20
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,417
(grunting)

21
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,667
- [Assailant] Get used to it.

22
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:09,891
(classic rock tones)

23
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,018
(grunt)

24
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,110
- [Prisoner] Jimmy, Jimmy.

25
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:41,289
- [Assailant] Adios, man.

26
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,250
- When I am elected
State's Attorney General,

27
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,900
Windgate will no longer be the exception,

28
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,093
it will be the rule.

29
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,843
- Take him out.

30
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,935
(groan)

31
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:01,836
(thuds)

32
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:07,580
(steady tempo classic rock tones)

33
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,013
Fuck you!

34
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,860
- Every square inch is
under 24 hour surveillance.

35
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,010
Machines replace men.

36
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,263
One guard does the job of a dozen.

37
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,463
(steady tempo classic rock tones)

38
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:01,130
(grunts, thuds)

39
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,058
(screaming)

40
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,280
These monitors allow us to see what's

41
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,440
going on throughout
all of our cell blocks.

42
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,123
So at all times, we're
in complete control.

43
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,793
- [Connie] Shouldn't you
be checking that out?

44
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,465
- See to that.
- Yeah.

45
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,298
- Quietly.
- All right.

46
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:45,480
- Well now, let's go to cell block A.

47
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,770
There are some wonderful new

48
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,820
recreational facilities
I'd like you to see.

49
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,966
- Mr. Goddard, that looked very serious.

50
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,883
- I'd like your impression
of this color scheme.

51
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:58,408
(anxious violin music)

52
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:09,614
(soft classic rock tones)

53
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,463
A fitting end to a piece
of filth like Luther.

54
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,390
But not in an election year.

55
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,570
Word gets around there's
been a killing in my

56
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,563
model cell block, the
press will tear me apart.

57
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,723
We've got to keep it quiet.

58
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,860
What is it I can do for you, Taylor?

59
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,233
- I want your job.

60
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,943
- All right.

61
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,270
All right, you can have Corrections when I

62
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,700
am elected Attorney General
but in the meantime,

63
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
you've gotta keep a lid on this place.

64
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,940
Now what are we gonna do with him?

65
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,470
- Let me explain what happened.

66
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,163
- You know, you've had it
too soft around here Boland.

67
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,583
But no more.

68
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,263
I'm gonna send you up to cell block C.

69
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,683
You know what that means?

70
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,783
You're gonna wish you'd never been born.

71
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,803
Do I make myself clear?

72
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
Ah.

73
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,463
A man of few words.

74
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,443
Good.

75
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,203
- We ain't got to worry about
a goddamn thing no more.

76
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,503
Sporty Black heard he cut
Luther from asshole to elbow.

77
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,340
- Now it's my turn to do some cutting.

78
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,180
- [Prison Guard] Blue.

79
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,023
Out.

80
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,560
- Man, what's going on?
- Out!

81
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:34,252
- Man, what the hell are you doing?

82
00:08:57,401 --> 00:09:02,401
- [Blue] Hey, so what is this?

83
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:12,769
- Bingo.

84
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,387
(classic rock tones)

85
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,200
Luther's dead, the gravy train is over.

86
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,050
I don't get mine, well
you don't get yours.

87
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,883
- It's only temporary.
- No.

88
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:38,600
No, your drug store's
out of business for good.

89
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,977
The chink just cut off
your line of supply.

90
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:30,420
- Don't you know what time it is?

91
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,100
- Time for you to get your lazy ass

92
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,163
out of bed and clean off this top bunk.

93
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,403
- You should learn some
manners, Lieutenant.

94
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,520
- [Prison Guard] Ready on the
lockdown for breakfast call.

95
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:27,479
(distant chattering, laughing)

96
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:29,993
- The bunk's clear.

97
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,973
- [Prisoner] That's the
vato that killed Luther.

98
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:17,994
(anxious violin, classic rock tones)

99
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:35,510
- Hey.
(laughing)

100
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,927
Come on fellas, give it back.

101
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,687
Fuck you guys.

102
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,343
Thanks.

103
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,863
- I wasn't hungry anyway.

104
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,440
- You know Sam, you've been filing all

105
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,420
that paperwork with the Prison Board,

106
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,710
gettin' the Warden
called in on the carpet.

107
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,160
Thought you was real
slick, now didn't you?

108
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,200
Now he done put that
boy right in your house.

109
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,100
You better watch you ass, man

110
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,950
'cause he knows Blue's comin' at him.

111
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:52,270
Tell you the truth
though, that boy deserves

112
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,095
what he gets, slicing up Luther like that.

113
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,130
Now don't get me wrong,

114
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,197
Luther and me wasn't tight or nothing.

115
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:59,200
- I loathed the man.

116
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,633
- But he was a brother.
- Not my brother.

117
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,230
- What the fuck are
you talkin' about, man?

118
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,959
You let crackers get
away with shit like that,

119
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,803
they'll be killing niggas all day long.

120
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,560
- I never met a nigga, Clint.

121
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,475
I don't know what a nigga looks like.

122
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:17,160
- Well the boy's no cracker anyway.

123
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,637
I mean he's Korean or something.

124
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:22,630
What's he doing hanging with the Diddler?

125
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,103
You think maybe he's perfecto?
(laughs)

126
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:39,905
- You know most of the guys

127
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:41,700
around here, they're real psychopaths.

128
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,640
When I see guys like that, I
thank God for prisons because

129
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,580
there's no way these guys
should be allowed on the street.

130
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,417
- I just gave you some food.

131
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:55,417
You got any other problems,
take it up with the Chaplain.

132
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,990
- My name's Wheelhead

133
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,823
and

134
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,200
I just wanted you to know
that me and the brothers,

135
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,200
we know about you and what
you've done down on A block and

136
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,030
even though you're supposed
to be some sort of half-breed

137
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,030
or something, we appreciate
it and you can hang with us.

138
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,420
- Take your hand off me.

139
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,373
- Man, I am just trying to be neighborly.

140
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,690
- [Jimmy] No thanks.

141
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,880
- This boy has got some spark here.

142
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,806
(prisoners chuckle)

143
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:42,028
(thud)

144
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:47,141
Oh Jesus.

145
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:54,180
(thud)
- Oh!

146
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,720
- You're a real hard rock.

147
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,770
- Yeah he is so get lost, we're eating.

148
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,750
- Fuck you, pan-freak!

149
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,583
Any mouth out of you and I'll

150
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,630
scrape it off your mother fuckin' zipper.

151
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,764
I'm gonna tell you something, kid.

152
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:18,400
You see me and the
brothers, we're all you have

153
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,253
and this place, this place here
ain't no place to be alone.

154
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,447
So you think about it.

155
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:47,244
(anxious slow rock tones)

156
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,410
- Why are you tampering
with my personal property?

157
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,433
- I was bored.

158
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,223
- Next time ask.

159
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,270
- What's with all the books?

160
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,733
- Knowledge is power.

161
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,183
- This is my power.

162
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,182
(low chuckle)

163
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:14,707
(mid tempo ensemble music)

164
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,353
- [Prisoner] Here he comes, the chink.

165
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:26,640
- You in the wrong part of town, boy.

166
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,280
- Sorry, it won't happen again.

167
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,143
- Damn right.

168
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:34,444
Hold it.

169
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,487
I'm talkin' to you, Chinaman.

170
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:43,247
You took out Luther, he was my partner.

171
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,629
He made sure things went pretty
sweet for me around here.

172
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,620
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

173
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,453
- Too bad.

174
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,790
(thud, grunt)

175
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,393
- Hey, what's going on,
what's going on here?

176
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,132
- Nothing.

177
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:00,330
- I'm just orienting the brother here to

178
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,450
this fine Corrections Facility
you allow us to occupy.

179
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,060
- Well orient the brother somewhere else.

180
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,091
Let's get out of here, Boland.

181
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:08,924
- Boland.

182
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,833
Watch your back.

183
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,453
Let's go.

184
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,780
- [Prison Guard] Recreation time is over,

185
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,277
ready for lockdown.

186
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:29,925
(relaxed guitar music)

187
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,363
- [Jimmy] Stark.

188
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:40,857
- What?

189
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,737
- Can I borrow a book?

190
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,676
- Up yours.
- Hey, calm down now.

191
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,893
- [Samuel] What's the matter, Boland?

192
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,240
- [Jimmy] Already read it.

193
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:16,033
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

194
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,933
- You like it?
- Yeah.

195
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,273
- Learn anything?

196
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,350
- That black people
think white people smell

197
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,450
like dogs when they get out of the shower.

198
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,086
- Let me see what else I can find here.

199
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:41,419
- [Prison Guard] Lights
out, lights out, 11 o'clock.

200
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,174
- I can't see her picture.
- Lights out, boy.

201
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,263
- You got any preferences?

202
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,283
- Chow hall.
- Mostly niggers in there.

203
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,330
- So what?

204
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,980
- You wouldn't last a day in there, pal.

205
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,780
I know where you should go, come on.

206
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,573
- [Prisoner] Hey, check it out man.

207
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:27,220
- Well Mr. Boland, welcome
to the laundry room.

208
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,126
- [Prisoner] Hey boy.

209
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:33,039
- [Prisoner] Wrong neck of the woods.

210
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,289
- Hey, check this dude out.

211
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:40,680
Come on down.

212
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,670
- Hey homeboy, what's
happening man, how you doing?

213
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,610
Hey, don't be fuckin' around
with my figure again huh?

214
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,470
Come on, I want to introduce you around.

215
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,973
This right there, that's Chicago man.

216
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,700
Doing double life.

217
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,030
He came home one day, he found
his old lady balling a spic.

218
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,863
Killed 'em both.

219
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,270
He's funny.

220
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,850
This guy over here, now
that's Weird Willy man.

221
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,140
He don't like faggots and
this, this is Stinkbomb man.

222
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:07,547
He ain't shittin', showerin'

223
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:09,280
or shavin' 'til he sees better days.

224
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,780
Then you got Leadbottom and that is Buck.

225
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,600
- What's my job?
- Hey man, relax.

226
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,190
Enjoy the scenery, come on.

227
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,620
Unlike the rest of this joint,

228
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,030
everything in here is white.
- Nice and clean.

229
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,210
- Just the way we like it.

230
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,170
- Except for you man, you
know but you did kill that

231
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,670
nigger and that counts for
something and you know how to

232
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,923
throw your hands and shit,
so we're gonna let you slide.

233
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,820
- Just tell me what my job is.

234
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,913
- What's the matter, too
good for us scooter trash?

235
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,610
- That's okay bro, let
him work like a pig.

236
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,933
You know laundry's in
his blood anyhow, man.

237
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:49,723
(prisoners laugh)

238
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:52,393
There's some clean sheets
over there, Mr. Boland.

239
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:54,314
Fold 'em.

240
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:01,697
- [Prisoner] Come on, man.

241
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:03,720
- Hey you all saw it, right?

242
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,630
I offered the man our hospitality

243
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,380
and he's over there folding sheets.

244
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,463
- Yeah.
- That's right.

245
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:18,083
- If you don't wanna hang with us,

246
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,150
why the hell did you kill Luther?

247
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,030
Oh well I get it, must've been one of

248
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,983
those lover's quarrel type things.

249
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:28,993
What the fuck are you gonna do, huh?

250
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:38,168
- Get him man, get him.
(thuds)

251
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,082
(grunts)

252
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,434
- Finish him, come on.

253
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:46,684
Finish Boland, fuck him up.

254
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:51,504
Come on, fuck him up, fuck him up.

255
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:57,046
(mid tempo classic rock music)

256
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:13,820
- Oh man.

257
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,384
- Woo hoo hoo.
- Oh man.

258
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,217
- Fucked him up.
- I thought he was tough, man.

259
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,938
- [Prisoner] I don't
like the way he walks.

260
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:37,355
- He's a punk.
- That's right.

261
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,678
- He's through.

262
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:44,095
(classical violin music)

263
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,660
- [Prison Guard]
Attention on the compound,

264
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,580
visitors hour will be from 10 a.m. to 12.

265
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,833
All inmates must have
a pass to be admitted.

266
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,400
Attention on the compound,
attention on the compound.

267
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,043
Inmate Bolas report to the infirmary.

268
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,640
(creepy chiming music)

269
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:28,368
- Got a visitor?

270
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,108
You seen Shrimp?

271
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,087
Come on, let's get some
exercise, you'll feel better.

272
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,292
(hard rock music)

273
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,930
(grunting)

274
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:25,920
- Jimmy, watch out!

275
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,743
(metal weights clanking)

276
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:36,743
- Come on man.
(thuds)

277
00:26:39,717 --> 00:26:41,134
Come on, come on.

278
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,751
- All right, come on.

279
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:50,186
(classic rock music)

280
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:02,941
- [Prisoner] There we go
man, you all messed up.

281
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:05,462
- Yeah.

282
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:10,775
- Do it man, do it.
- That's a smart man.

283
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:15,028
- Show him man.
- Show him what you got.

284
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:17,820
All together man, all together.

285
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,070
Come on, I'm betting on us.

286
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,931
(mid tempo electronic, rock music)

287
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:30,507
- Get him, get him.

288
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,745
(thuds)

289
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,784
(grunts)

290
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:51,750
- [Prisoner] Get him, Charlie.

291
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,583
Get him.

292
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,740
Come on get up, get up, get up.

293
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,601
- All right Jimmy, all right.

294
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,054
- [Prisoner] See, you didn't listen to me.

295
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:10,137
- [Prisoner] Come on get up, come on.

296
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,459
- [Prisoner Watch your back, Jimmy.

297
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:14,459
(groan)

298
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:23,156
(scream)

299
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:27,568
- [Prisoner] All right, all right.

300
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,693
(gasping)

301
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:35,804
Guards, guards coming.

302
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,177
- Cuff him.

303
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:56,058
Isolation.

304
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,920
- Hey, that was self-defense.

305
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,443
- You mind your own business, pervert.

306
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:22,242
(relaxed piano, trumpet music)

307
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,093
- [Prison Guard] Pretty
nasty cut you got there, son.

308
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,133
See you in 30 days.

309
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,160
- See that's where you fucked
up with the bitch, man.

310
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,240
Instead of treating her right
and giving her all that shit,

311
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,280
you should've had her dancing in the bar

312
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,380
and making some money for a mother fucker.

313
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,760
- Kinda crowded in there.

314
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:02,093
- I'll catch you later Stinkbomb, here.

315
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,513
You got some word?

316
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,793
- These petitions take time.

317
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:21,400
- Ah shit, what the fuck's
taking them so long?

318
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,303
Just beat it, man.

319
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:28,820
- I want to talk about Jimmy.
- That's family business.

320
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,143
- I want it over, now.

321
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,080
- Boland took out three of my best,

322
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,923
you know I can't absorb
an insult like that.

323
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:38,873
That wouldn't be a proper
figurehead type thing to do, man.

324
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,740
- You want that appeal or not?

325
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,603
- Shit.

326
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
He wasted one of yours man, you know?

327
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,610
I figured I was doing
you and the crew a favor.

328
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,880
- Let me tell you something Wheelhead,

329
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,090
Luther wasn't my anything,
the crew is not my crew.

330
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,270
Jimmy is in my house.

331
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,520
I got one foot out the door,
I want no complications.

332
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,983
Do you understand me?

333
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,513
- Mm hmm.
- Yeah.

334
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:20,657
(relaxed electronic, trumpet music)

335
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,040
- You are an idiot.

336
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,210
- Sir, regulations say the
offender must be isolated.

337
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,540
- Regulations?

338
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,240
Who in the hell do you
think you're talking to?

339
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,900
I want Boland back with Stark.

340
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,140
Every time Bolan scratches his ass,

341
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,400
I want him poking Stark
in the eye, you got that?

342
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,313
- Yes sir.

343
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,693
- Good.

344
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:56,688
- [Prisoner] Prison guard coming.

345
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:02,373
- Today's your lucky day, Boland.

346
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,573
Get dressed.

347
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,825
- [Prisoner] I'm tired of
this, I can't take it no more.

348
00:32:12,825 --> 00:32:14,300
- Your boys got whooped.

349
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,880
All those fat ass Goliaths lying

350
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,480
around like a bunch of junk cars

351
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,670
and Boland with hardly a scratch.

352
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,830
- I know, I know man,
don't bug me about it okay?

353
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,940
- Watch you want, caveman?

354
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,240
- The kid's yours.

355
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,810
- I knew that the moment
he came on the block.

356
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,390
- And I would appreciate it if you'd

357
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,573
stomp his mother fuckin' ass for me.

358
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:33,093
- I wouldn't have it any other way.

359
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,124
- Why are they sending him here?

360
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:42,980
- That boy is nothing but trouble.

361
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,010
- [Samuel] Ain't no telling
once we in the middle of it.

362
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,413
- [Clint] What are you gonna do?

363
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,450
- Hey, hey Jimmy.

364
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,643
- Hey, how you doing?

365
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:53,750
Tony DiAngelo, Tony D to my friends.

366
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,490
- Jimmy, this is everybody,
this is Joe, this is Kelly,

367
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,140
Clint Dunsmore, Henry Jones.

368
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,973
Grab a chair.

369
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,773
Taylor gave you to us,

370
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:03,606
so we're gonna put you straight to work.

371
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,500
- Yeah, we be workin' up
something in here boy.

372
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,237
We gonna start you off to work

373
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,520
with a fresh bowl of Italian ziti.

374
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,953
- Ain't that nice, huh?

375
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,880
What kind of cheese you want?

376
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,820
We got Parmesan, ricotta.

377
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,323
- Hey, do you like wine boy?

378
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,923
- What, that jailhouse bunk?

379
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:22,273
- No no no, we gonna raise here son.

380
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:24,393
- [Henry] It's the real deal.

381
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,080
- Ernest and Julio ain't got shit on us.

382
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,610
- I gotta tell you boy, I
so like the way you scrap.

383
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,270
- Yeah, you draw a mean shake.

384
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,630
You sure you ain't got
Italian blood mixed in you?

385
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,463
- It's possible.

386
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,810
- Muhammad Ali.
- It's possible.

387
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,810
- Hey Jimmy, listen.

388
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:42,953
We're gonna have to keep an eye on you.

389
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:45,130
I can't afford any trouble
in my house, not now.

390
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,253
- [Prison Guard]
Attention on the compound,

391
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,557
inmate Boland, report to the infirmary.

392
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:53,570
- Are you sick?

393
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,680
- No, they just gotta check out that

394
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,423
souvenir I got from the
welcoming committee.

395
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,190
- You watch your ass boy
or we'll watch it for you.

396
00:34:04,655 --> 00:34:06,738
(laughs)

397
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,949
- [Blue] I told you it won't be a problem.

398
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,249
- What you mean no
problem, all them old guys?

399
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:18,900
- Man you crazy, those old
birds won't be working.

400
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,940
They'll be dreaming up their piece of

401
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,280
the American pie and
watching that game show.

402
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,180
- Hey man, I like that game show.

403
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,660
All them big-tittied
hos getting all sporty

404
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,293
around them college freshman and whatnot.

405
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:36,297
- But now your boy, come
12 noon, will be working.

406
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,110
Mooning over those marigolds
and pampering those poppies

407
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,930
and he'll be all ours.

408
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:45,971
- Asshole to elbow.

409
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:50,723
- You know it.
- Mm hmm.

410
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:53,353
- I appealed on the Williams roll.

411
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,463
I figured with statutory
gained time and working time,

412
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,503
hell, I'll be outta here in 12 days.

413
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:07,313
- [Prison Guard] Lights
out, lights out, 11 o'clock.

414
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,643
- Jimmy.

415
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,310
Tell me about Luther,
I'd really like to know.

416
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,850
- Oh,

417
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,683
Luther.

418
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,370
There's nothing much to tell.

419
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,516
A friend of mine,

420
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:33,768
a black guy

421
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,970
asked me to look out for a cousin of his.

422
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,353
Christ, he was just a kid.

423
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:47,254
As soon as he moved into A block,

424
00:35:47,254 --> 00:35:48,954
Luther and his gang moved in fast.

425
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,473
They raped and killed him.

426
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,243
(somber piano, trumpet music)

427
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,083
- So how'd you come to be
sent here in the first place?

428
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:19,840
- There was this bar I used
to go to sometimes after work.

429
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,483
One day a fight broke out,

430
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,282
a real war.

431
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:28,258
All I wanted to do was get outta there.

432
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,054
The next thing I know, a guy's dead and

433
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:34,554
they're pinning the rap on me,

434
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,803
manslaughter.

435
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,263
10 years.

436
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,873
- Why'd they pick you?

437
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:47,294
- Didn't like the color of my skin.

438
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,440
Hey, I'm an American born and bred

439
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,714
and just because I'm half-Japanese,

440
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,864
the cops are always
lookin' at me sideways.

441
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:02,823
(low chuckle)

442
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:08,538
- Lord knows I know a
little something about that.

443
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:16,821
(somber piano, trumpet music)

444
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,450
Now you say

445
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,330
Warden Taylor knowingly withheld

446
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,540
information that could've helped you?

447
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,060
- [Jimmy] Mm hmm.

448
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,660
- Well if that's true, we have a case.

449
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,817
- [Steve] Which brings
Laura's cash total to $5,000.

450
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,187
But that's not all--
- Ooh, baby.

451
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:03,511
- [Steve] What else has
Laura won today, Wesley?

452
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:04,791
- [Wesley] Well Steve, she's got

453
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,446
a seven day all-paid expenses trip--

454
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,641
- Hey man Tony, get your ass out here,

455
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:08,474
you're gonna miss this.

456
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:10,450
- You want your spaghetti hot, don't you?

457
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,190
- Just get your Guinea ass out here, man.

458
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,708
- Yes, bwana.

459
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,008
Wow, look at that broad,
she's a big one, huh?

460
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,050
- Hey man, I love big women, man.

461
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,043
A nice big juicy onion,
a woman I could climb.

462
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,280
I don't know what it is
about you white boys, man.

463
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,830
Y'all all like them women
with them little behinds.

464
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,873
- Hey Jimmy, how you doing?

465
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,237
Pull up a chair.

466
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:33,250
- But that's not all.
- No it isn't, Steve.

467
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,708
- Unlike some people, I got work to do.

468
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:42,708
- Hey, we got work to do too.
(laughs)

469
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,600
(cough)

470
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,980
- Got any tits on that cart?
- Nope.

471
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,630
- What, the Chaplain picking
out these films or what?

472
00:38:58,257 --> 00:38:59,960
- Cut that mother fuckin' chink,

473
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,427
that's the way Blue want it.

474
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:10,512
(anxious flute, guitar music)

475
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,040
What you want, boy?

476
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,193
- I'm looking for Stark.
- He ain't here.

477
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,647
Get outta here, now.

478
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,074
- You and Mike went.
- Pass the ball.

479
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:55,268
- Man, can't you find
some goddamn chicken?

480
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,630
I'm tired of this shit.

481
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,320
Mother fucker, how much are sausages?

482
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,140
- [Tony] What do you think I'm doing here?

483
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,007
- I'm tired of this shit.
- Trying to cook for you.

484
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:04,297
Fuck you, shit.

485
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:06,033
- [Clint] I'll stick a
pineapple up your ass.

486
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:07,730
- [Tony] You know what,
you're gonna fuckin' eat it.

487
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:12,025
It's going in your mouth,
it's not going in mine.

488
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:15,442
(anxious ensemble tones)

489
00:40:21,884 --> 00:40:22,717
- Hey.

490
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,069
What's the matter, you're
making too much damn noise.

491
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,236
- Jimmy.
- Gonna kick your diamond ass.

492
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,303
(anxious rock tones)

493
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:48,070
- Just got off the boat, think
you own the fuckin' world.

494
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,850
Racist mother fucker.

495
00:40:52,554 --> 00:40:55,699
- Come on, mother fucker.
- You scared, boy?

496
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:59,616
(mid tempo classic rock music)

497
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:08,892
(thuds)

498
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,818
(groan)

499
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,640
- Hey Stark.

500
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,473
Jimmy.

501
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,133
- Yeah, yeah.

502
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:34,033
Come on.
(thud)

503
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,577
- [Prisoner] Come on get
up, what are you doing?

504
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:40,153
- You fucking rat bastard.

505
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,489
These guys were beating
the shit out of this guy.

506
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:51,788
I want you to know I had
nothin' to do with it, nothing.

507
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:53,159
(thuds)

508
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,734
- Come on Jimmy, get the fuckin' door.

509
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:57,504
- Open this goddamn fuckin' door.

510
00:41:57,504 --> 00:42:02,254
Come on Jimmy, open this damn
door, I ain't bullshitting.

511
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:09,012
Assholes.

512
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:13,237
- All of you

513
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,353
for one man?

514
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,180
They're showing you a
lot of respect Jimmy,

515
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,563
coming at you this deep.

516
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,323
What, somebody got a problem
with this man, huh Sporty?

517
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,890
How about you, French Fry?

518
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,533
You got a problem with this man, Stewart?

519
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,413
No, no, no, no, no.

520
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,393
There's only one man in here
who's got a problem, one man.

521
00:42:45,393 --> 00:42:48,833
- what you doing house nigga,
working for the Warden?

522
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,313
- Luther supplied you with drugs, Blue.

523
00:42:56,388 --> 00:42:58,483
The crew paid you for what you got free.

524
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:01,691
- For free?
- That's right.

525
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:04,187
- [Prisoner] What's up
Blue, what he talkin' about?

526
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,290
- So why don't you show the
crew just how it's done?

527
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,463
- No problem.
- No problem?

528
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,980
Let the brother supreme
show us all how it's done.

529
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,230
- [Prisoner] Do it, Blue.

530
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,917
- Sound good for you?

531
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,768
- Let's get busy.

532
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:33,217
(anxious ensemble music)

533
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:35,217
(thuds)

534
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,058
(grunts)

535
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:45,808
- Get up, get up man.

536
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:53,409
Kick his ass man, I'm tired of this guy.

537
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:54,826
Kick his ass man.

538
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,984
(scream)

539
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:13,055
Come on, Blue.

540
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:27,726
(thuds, grunts)

541
00:44:32,064 --> 00:44:34,668
- [Clint] Yo, those guards passing.

542
00:44:34,668 --> 00:44:36,001
- That's enough.

543
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:46,130
(thud, grunt)

544
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,363
I said that's enough.

545
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,103
Yeah go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

546
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,103
Come on.

547
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,657
Come on, Jimmy.

548
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,110
These men here seem to
think you hate them, Jimmy.

549
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,320
They think you hate all
blacks, is this true?

550
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,070
- I've got no problem with anyone.

551
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,890
- They've also been led
to believe that you killed

552
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,193
their dear friend Luther
maliciously and without a cause.

553
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,933
Is this true?

554
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,033
- It was malicious.

555
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,363
But I had cause.

556
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,640
- It seems

557
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,220
that your dear brother Luther

558
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,373
attacked a friend of Jimmy's.

559
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,163
Luther hit on a black
man, a brother, a child!

560
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,920
Raped him and killed him.

561
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,980
Jimmy did what he had to do,

562
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,633
it wasn't right, it wasn't smart,

563
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,853
it was human

564
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:19,935
and he'll have to live with that.

565
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:23,226
You see,

566
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,850
we were all born into a bad situation

567
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,993
and we graduated to something even worse.

568
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:33,093
They don't care whether
we live or die in here.

569
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,433
So if you wanna fight,

570
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:37,623
fight the damn system that got you here.

571
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,193
Not each other.

572
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:49,001
(relaxed violin, flute music)

573
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,033
You all right?

574
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,583
Shit.

575
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,463
Get the hell outta my garden,
get the hell out, let's go!

576
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,910
- Hey Diddler.

577
00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:33,612
Thanks.

578
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:47,259
(relaxed guitar tones)

579
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,640
- Well Jimmy, I wish I could
say it's over but it's not.

580
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,140
Blue's anger is endless.

581
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:58,560
Next time he comes at you,
he won't be in a crowd.

582
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,293
It'll be outta nowhere and fast.

583
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,230
You better be ready.

584
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,580
- What's he so angry about?

585
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,400
- He's serving a double life term.

586
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,570
- I didn't mean to get you involved.

587
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:14,013
- You didn't have anything to do with it.

588
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,673
We share a house, Jimmy.

589
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:21,193
It was unavoidable, Taylor saw to that.

590
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,703
- [Lucas] Any time, boy.

591
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,900
- You see a boy, Lucas,

592
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,493
you'd get down and suck his bald dick.

593
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,640
- You could've used some more

594
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,030
of that tough guy shit yesterday.

595
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,330
- Hey man, they jumped me.

596
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,643
- Who?
- Boland, Stark.

597
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:42,930
I don't want no trouble,

598
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,590
I just want to do my
time like everybody else.

599
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,653
But those two, they're
just begging for it.

600
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:51,529
- Well what's next,

601
00:48:53,023 --> 00:48:53,873
the trouble over?

602
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:55,993
- Just starting.

603
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,660
Crew's so pissed off, they
ready to slap off and ride.

604
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,423
You'll be dropping Boland and
Stark in body bags in no time.

605
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,160
- You've been very helpful, Blue.

606
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,733
This is your lucky day.

607
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,013
You do whatever it takes.

608
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,002
Go on.

609
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,371
- [Lucas] What do you think?

610
00:49:38,371 --> 00:49:39,390
- Well I think that somebody's

611
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,233
gonna get hurt real bad real soon.

612
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,610
- So how do we handle it, isolation?

613
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,443
- No.

614
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,997
I kind of like to see Stark
in the thick of things.

615
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,110
No confinement for anyone.

616
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,560
- Fellas into the yard,

617
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,080
we got some serious conspiring to do.

618
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,280
- I ain't doing nothing.

619
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,753
- All you trying to do
is catch a brother up.

620
00:50:23,753 --> 00:50:26,907
A brother will lose his
teeth listening to you.

621
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:30,410
- [Blue] You ought to show
the brother some respect.

622
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,180
- Fuck that, that old man is okay.

623
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,400
- And I ain't got no
problem with the chink.

624
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,609
- He took out Luther.
- So the fuck what?

625
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:40,059
The way you carrying on, you'd think

626
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:41,863
y'all two was swapping spit or something.

627
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,533
- Nobody talks to me that way.

628
00:50:52,646 --> 00:50:56,479
- Man what you gonna do,
kill all us brothers?

629
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:23,140
- Get your ziti cooking, Guinea
ass outta that damn chair.

630
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,220
You ain't done nothin' all day.

631
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,310
- Are you crazy?

632
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,453
You think it's easy organizing this shit?

633
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,920
(anxious violin tones)

634
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,870
- What do you want?

635
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,630
- Listen man, it ain't like that.

636
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,290
We just a bunch of jitterbugs
trying to do the right thing.

637
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,400
- What the brother trying
to say is we feel bad,

638
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,220
we'd like to help you fix your place up.

639
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,380
You old enough to be our father.

640
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,680
We shouldn't be doing
this to no old pops dude

641
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:55,951
and Boland, we ain't got
no problem with you, man.

642
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:56,868
- Nah, man.

643
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,570
- We could use the help.

644
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:28,840
- Old man hit a fuckin' homer off my head.

645
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,920
Now that's a terrible
morale-type thing, man.

646
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,970
- I know what you mean,

647
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,310
crew spent half the
week planting petunias.

648
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:38,610
- Fuck it, I ain't puttin'
up with this shit no more.

649
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,210
You know I got leadership qualities

650
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,260
and I'm looking like a fuckin' towelhead.

651
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,740
- Well, we're gonna end it right now.

652
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,473
- Who, you and me?
- That's what I said.

653
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,100
I got a thing with the Warden,
might come in handy one day.

654
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,410
We gotta share the power, baby.

655
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,013
- When you wanna do it, man?
- Soon.

656
00:53:05,045 --> 00:53:07,595
We've gotta start at the
bottom, the pervert first.

657
00:53:11,499 --> 00:53:13,997
We gotta have a system, right?
- Right, man.

658
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:26,361
- Hey man.
(inmates shouting)

659
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:34,129
Oh yeah, pervert.

660
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:36,379
(clapping)

661
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:49,088
- Hey, you wanna see this film or not?

662
00:54:01,145 --> 00:54:03,395
(laughing)

663
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,510
- [Prisoner] No, no man.

664
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:21,177
- [Prisoner] Hey Diddler, hey
man, get it goin' partner.

665
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,147
(speaking foreign language)

666
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:40,045
(up tempo flute, guitar music)

667
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,405
- Yeah.
- Come on, TNT.

668
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,014
Shut up.

669
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,093
- Perhaps

670
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,451
this will not be necessary.

671
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:04,868
- I've never made it with a chink before.

672
00:55:09,217 --> 00:55:10,384
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

673
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:20,131
(inmates cheering)

674
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:40,816
- [Actress] Okay baby.

675
00:55:42,686 --> 00:55:46,353
(speaking foreign language)

676
00:55:55,145 --> 00:55:58,562
(anxious ensemble music)

677
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:12,253
(stifled screaming)

678
00:56:53,062 --> 00:56:55,729
(thuds, grunts)

679
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:01,615
- Hey.
- Hey!

680
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:06,262
- Come on, man.
- What you doing, man?

681
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:10,152
(inmates shouting)

682
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:16,752
Let's go.

683
00:57:19,121 --> 00:57:20,954
Get your ass out here.

684
00:57:23,463 --> 00:57:24,296
Punk ass.

685
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,909
(somber violin music)

686
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:48,600
- All right ladies, entertainment is over.

687
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,853
Back to the cell house!

688
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:52,108
Move!

689
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:56,395
(anxious rock tones)

690
00:58:10,336 --> 00:58:11,836
- Back off, Jimmy.

691
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:16,815
We're going home, we're going home.

692
00:58:16,815 --> 00:58:21,815
Come on.

693
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,390
So what are you gonna do, Jimmy?

694
00:58:29,248 --> 00:58:30,448
You gonna kill 'em both?

695
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:36,593
You wanna risk a life term
because of these men, huh?

696
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,283
20 years, 20 years of total lockdown.

697
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,190
I'll tell you something else,

698
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,710
the first five gonna be in a
hellhole half the size of this.

699
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,070
Is that what you want,
what's the matter with you?

700
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,950
Have you lost your taste for freedom?

701
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,533
- He saved my life.

702
00:58:57,608 --> 00:58:58,441
- Yeah.

703
00:59:07,374 --> 00:59:08,920
You had to bring me up here?

704
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,060
- [Taylor] Yeah, because up
here you can smell freedom.

705
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,810
This is as close as
you're gonna get to it.

706
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,073
- Why you trying to jam my time, Taylor?

707
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,690
You wait 'til I'm almost ready to go home

708
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,920
and then you drop this situation on me.

709
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,910
- Situation?

710
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,910
- That's right, you know
what I'm talking about.

711
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,950
- Yes.

712
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,210
Well, I understand that
you and Mr. Boland are

713
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,150
almost like brothers now.

714
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,840
- Let me tell you something, Taylor.

715
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,630
I don't belong in C block
and nor does the kid.

716
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,750
He's only gonna wind up killed

717
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,690
and why aren't Blue and
Wheelhead in isolation?

718
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:43,580
And your damn guards,

719
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,960
all they do is drink coffee all day long.

720
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,323
They only come around
after the trouble is over.

721
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
- Oh, well thank God we have a man

722
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,363
to tell us how to do our job now.

723
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,723
I mean without you,

724
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:59,860
I just don't know how we
could possibly carry on.

725
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,763
You're dismissed, counselor.

726
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:13,290
- Stark really gets your goat, doesn't he?

727
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,313
- He's been breaking my balls for years.

728
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,523
Filing writs, drowning me in paper.

729
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,163
Making me treat these
animals like human beings.

730
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,200
Well now it's my turn.
- What are you fixing to do?

731
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,530
- One of these days soon,
somebody's gonna get sliced up

732
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:38,934
and when that happens,

733
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:41,163
I'm gonna be there to pin it on Stark.

734
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,810
- You know every day when I
used to come home from school,

735
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,700
my mom would fry me up some grilled

736
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,060
Swiss and tomato sandwiches,

737
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,893
every day.

738
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,160
Never nothing else.

739
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,800
I couldn't fuckin' stand 'em

740
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,400
and now since I've been
inside, I think about

741
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,083
those damn grilled Swisses
and my mom too, you know.

742
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,623
She worked really hard at making those.

743
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,833
- It's a real nice sentimental
story, give me the grill.

744
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,143
- Oh man.

745
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,370
I wish we had some tomatoes.

746
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,320
- Now if you want that greenhouse shit,

747
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:34,297
you better go kiss Stark's wrinkled ass.

748
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:37,943
- Fuck that old man.

749
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,560
- You wanna fuck me, Wheelhead?

750
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,127
- Talking's over, old man.
- Yeah.

751
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:53,577
Look what you did to my head.

752
01:01:55,928 --> 01:01:56,993
- You never looked better.

753
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,460
- I'm through with you, man.

754
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,270
You and me both know I
ain't never gonna get

755
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,660
no writ of Habeas what the fuck ever, man.

756
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,150
I am here for 20 years.

757
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,043
So you suck my dick.

758
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,380
- Look, there's a lot of men in here that

759
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,453
don't want to see Jimmy
get hurt, they respect him.

760
01:02:22,453 --> 01:02:24,067
They like to see a man
who can handle himself,

761
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,993
who sticks up for his friends.

762
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,373
So maybe it's time the two
of you just kinda let it go.

763
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,520
- This is the last stop for me, Stark.

764
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,893
The man waxed my life.

765
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:41,592
He doesn't like me as much
as he likes you, uncle.

766
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:51,080
If I don't get me any respect
right now, mother fuckers

767
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,530
will be playing me close
for the rest of my life.

768
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,493
So I'm gonna get me some
straightening and then I'll rest.

769
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,623
If I have to go through
you to do it, so be it.

770
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:13,090
- You know Blue, I feel sorry for you.

771
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,923
So involved with your own hate.

772
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,823
You'd rather die than let it go.

773
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:21,003
- Man,

774
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:25,400
I am tired of your sorry ass,

775
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,653
Mahatma Gandhi peaceful
resistance bullshit.

776
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,550
- You punks have been killing me with your

777
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,463
eyes and your mouths
for damn near 15 years.

778
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,883
But I'm still standing.

779
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,183
- That's it.

780
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,750
We do it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow's a holiday, man.

781
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,843
- I know, my Independence Day.

782
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:09,152
(relaxed country guitar music)

783
01:04:09,152 --> 01:04:11,853
- [Prison Guard]
Attention on the compound,

784
01:04:11,853 --> 01:04:15,700
Bill Goddard, Head of our
Department of Corrections

785
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,950
will be bringing a delegation
here for President's Day.

786
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:23,400
He wants you to show our
guests how much you appreciate

787
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,233
the celebration by being
on your best behavior.

788
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,321
Let's make this a holiday
- Hello.

789
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:32,738
- [Prison Guard] To remember.

790
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:45,720
- There's a lot of people out

791
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,420
there in their own little prisons.

792
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,551
So what's the count?

793
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:53,143
A few more days and you're outta here.

794
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,633
- Yeah.

795
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,423
Three more days and I wake up.

796
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,246
- You know Jimmy, I've been

797
01:05:06,246 --> 01:05:07,723
doing some thinking about your case.

798
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:12,589
I might be able to help you
when I get on the outside.

799
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,560
You know when I'm gone,

800
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,793
these inmates are gonna need a counselor.

801
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:26,953
I mean,

802
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:30,810
somebody's gonna have
to pick up the mantle.

803
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:31,643
What do you say?

804
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,100
- I don't think so.

805
01:05:44,495 --> 01:05:48,400
- [Prison Guard] Attention
on the compound, all inmates

806
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,783
report to your assigned
areas for President's Day.

807
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,783
Let's make this a holiday to remember.

808
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,557
(chattering)

809
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:05,890
- [Prisoner] But baby, I'm
only here for five more years.

810
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,250
- And for the last eight years as Director

811
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,960
of the Department of
Corrections, I've turned

812
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,400
hardened criminals into
productive members of society.

813
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,763
That's why I decided to run
for State's Attorney General.

814
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,970
Well now, ladies and
gentlemen of the press,

815
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,720
feel free to look around and I think

816
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,083
you'll find that my methods are working.

817
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:36,150
- Goddamn, a whole half chicken.

818
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:40,330
Napkins, red, white and blue
silverware and look at that,

819
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,683
corn on the mother fuckin' cob.

820
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:46,600
There must be something special going on.

821
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,680
Sweet potato pie, yeah.

822
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,260
- Yeah, I saw the Pope out in

823
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,253
the yard slicing up a jungle plum.

824
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,080
- Goddard's still running his mouth.

825
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,880
- Attention on the compound,
attention on the compound,

826
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,470
all inmates wishing to
participate in intramural sports,

827
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:07,623
see the Recreation Officer by tomorrow.

828
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:28,810
- You know we've learned from experience

829
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,740
that when an inmate's belly is full,

830
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:34,490
he's less prone to violent
and erratic behavior.

831
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:35,323
I know I am.

832
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,933
So we feed them well.

833
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,283
Well but not too well.

834
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:47,280
Try the potatoes.

835
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,060
- They should've filmed
this yesterday, huh?

836
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,250
- Oh yeah, mystery meat.
- Damn Stark,

837
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:01,070
pretty soon you'll be able to
eat like this every damn day.

838
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:01,903
- What are you talking about?

839
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:03,720
He's been eating good.

840
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,210
When you get out there,

841
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,940
there's nobody makes sauce like mine.

842
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,230
- Is that right, Tony A?

843
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,102
- What's the first thing you're gonna

844
01:08:11,102 --> 01:08:12,240
do Stark, when you hit the street?

845
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,740
- I know what I'm gonna do,

846
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,980
I'm gonna break loose the fuckin' jam

847
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,733
because my pussy's all tore up.

848
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:20,759
(laughs)

849
01:08:23,203 --> 01:08:25,490
- No, I think I'm gonna go to the beach.

850
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:29,168
- Hey man, they got some find
sandy trim down at the beach.

851
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:30,410
- No, no, no.

852
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,893
I think I'm gonna go at dusk.

853
01:08:33,635 --> 01:08:34,760
You know that time of the day when

854
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,660
there are very few people on the beach

855
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:40,340
and the only sounds you
can hear are the seagulls

856
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:43,773
and the waves splashing up on the sand?

857
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,630
The sky takes on those beautiful

858
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:50,763
colors of orange and red and purple

859
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:55,343
and your toes are all warmed by the sand.

860
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,533
Yeah, that's when I'll take my swim.

861
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,020
- And then you'll get some pussy.

862
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,124
(laughs)

863
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,590
- Attention on the compound,
attention on the compound,

864
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:21,760
inmate Stark, report to Horticulture.

865
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,100
- Hey, it's our seeds.

866
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,300
Hey, we're gonna have
grown tomatoes fellas.

867
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:28,732
- Not a moment's peace.

868
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,149
- Relax, I'll go.

869
01:09:42,107 --> 01:09:45,690
(anxious low violin tones)

870
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:57,790
(slow tempo rock tones)

871
01:10:38,191 --> 01:10:41,140
- Attention on the compound,
attention on the compound,

872
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,623
inmate Boland report to the infirmary.

873
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,433
- Hey, the nurse is calling Jimmy.

874
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,650
- Bandages coming off I guess.

875
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,030
I'm gonna go up and tell
'em he's on his way.

876
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,180
When he comes back,
tell him to come on up.

877
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:10,473
(anxious ensemble tones)

878
01:11:26,021 --> 01:11:28,456
- Where's Stark?
- He just left.

879
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:30,522
He went to the infirmary for you.

880
01:11:30,522 --> 01:11:34,483
Your bandages coming off?
- They came off yesterday.

881
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,410
- Hey, where you going?

882
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:41,490
Let's go get him.

883
01:12:04,482 --> 01:12:07,384
- Shit, it's the old man.

884
01:12:07,384 --> 01:12:10,217
- I really don't care who's first.

885
01:12:18,473 --> 01:12:21,556
(anxious rock tones)

886
01:12:23,313 --> 01:12:25,563
(grunting)

887
01:12:41,918 --> 01:12:42,751
Let's go.

888
01:12:50,122 --> 01:12:53,705
(somber piano, rock tones)

889
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,430
- [Jimmy] Get help.

890
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:59,593
- Go get help.
- Okay.

891
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,960
They got Stark.
- Wait, what happened?

892
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,270
- They stabbed him.
- We gotta do something.

893
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:07,810
Let's go, come on.
- It's just a skirmish.

894
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:09,210
Everything is under control.

895
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,022
Our guests are not to leave this room.

896
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:14,350
Be right back.

897
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:16,110
- One side.

898
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:16,943
Move it.

899
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,203
Show's over, gotta get help in here.

900
01:13:21,203 --> 01:13:24,710
- Boland, let him go.
- You did this.

901
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,650
- Cut off all the phone
lines to the outside.

902
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,070
- I know what happened.

903
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:29,903
I know

904
01:13:31,475 --> 01:13:34,250
and so do they.
- Come on, Jimmy.

905
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,940
Let the doctors do their job.

906
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,670
- Lieutenant, I told
you to clear this area.

907
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,123
- Goddammit move, now!

908
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:43,569
- You can't do nothin' now, Jimmy.

909
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:46,333
- Yeah, stay calm.

910
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:47,828
- Take care of him.

911
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:49,403
- [Prison Guard] All inmates report

912
01:13:49,403 --> 01:13:51,799
to your assigned areas immediately.

913
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:53,910
- Get off me, man.
- You better back out my face.

914
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:58,910
- Kick some ass.
(inmates shouting)

915
01:14:05,915 --> 01:14:06,823
- What's going on?

916
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:08,104
- I'll tell you what's going on.

917
01:14:08,104 --> 01:14:10,004
Somebody got himself fucked
up, that's what's going on.

918
01:14:10,004 --> 01:14:11,180
- Fucked up, what do you mean fucked up?

919
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,720
- Fucked up, fucked up, ain't nothin' new.

920
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,210
Every day around here it's something else.

921
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:16,043
- Let's go.

922
01:14:21,202 --> 01:14:22,702
- [Prisoner] Move.

923
01:14:24,098 --> 01:14:26,829
- [Prisoner] Hey man, somebody got Stark.

924
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:30,018
They took him out man, come on.

925
01:14:30,018 --> 01:14:31,758
Come on man, come on.

926
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:34,551
They got him down there, come on with me.

927
01:14:34,551 --> 01:14:37,718
- Listen Roger, we gotta help him out.

928
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,663
- Hey you guys, there's
a news van over there.

929
01:14:42,663 --> 01:14:46,004
We gotta get their attention, come on.

930
01:14:46,004 --> 01:14:48,254
(shouting)

931
01:14:51,299 --> 01:14:53,127
- You can't do nothin' about that, boy.

932
01:14:53,127 --> 01:14:56,377
- I don't care.
- He's right about that.

933
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:01,750
- I've got business.

934
01:15:03,143 --> 01:15:06,198
- Want me to fire your ass, Jimmy?

935
01:15:06,198 --> 01:15:11,198
(alarm blaring)
(inmates shouting)

936
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,413
- Get out there.

937
01:15:16,023 --> 01:15:18,356
Don't let this thing spread.

938
01:15:24,557 --> 01:15:25,390
Contain.

939
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:27,588
Contain.

940
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,447
(up tempo rock music)

941
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:59,490
- What is this, what's happening?

942
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:03,510
It was one old man, what's going on?

943
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:05,150
- Anything could set it off,

944
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:07,530
sometimes it stops just as fast.

945
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:10,383
- The media is here for Christ's sake.

946
01:16:10,383 --> 01:16:11,380
(knock)

947
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:14,230
- It's the press, they're
heading for cell block C.

948
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,860
- Well stop them.

949
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,640
Now listen to me, you get
control of this right now

950
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,590
or you'll be busted back to guard duty.

951
01:16:28,473 --> 01:16:33,473
(alarm blaring)
(inmates shouting)

952
01:16:33,651 --> 01:16:34,484
- Shit man, everybody in

953
01:16:34,484 --> 01:16:36,523
the whole fuckin' joint knows we did it.

954
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:39,214
- Man, why don't you just shut up?

955
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:43,530
We did nothing, they don't know anything.

956
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:46,004
All they're gonna do is lock us down.

957
01:16:46,004 --> 01:16:48,440
Now we just shut up and play dumb

958
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,003
and I know you can do that.

959
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:53,840
We're gonna be all right,
get the fuck in the cell.

960
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,707
- [Prison Guard] All inmates

961
01:16:55,707 --> 01:16:58,020
report back to your assigned areas.

962
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:02,280
We will be forced to
use extreme prejudice.

963
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,842
This is your final warning.

964
01:17:04,842 --> 01:17:06,289
- [Blue] Man, you're starting
to sound like a little bitch.

965
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,603
- We're fucked, man.
- That's right.

966
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,810
- [Wheelhead] Fucking gasoline, man.

967
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:22,545
(grunts, thuds)

968
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:33,940
- [Lieutenant] This is not a game inmates,

969
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:37,060
hit the fucking floor now
or we will open it up.

970
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,053
- This is for Luther.
- No.

971
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,833
It's for Stark.

972
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:10,931
(mid tempo rock music)

973
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:23,505
- Son of a bitch.

974
01:18:24,853 --> 01:18:26,511
Get up!

975
01:18:26,511 --> 01:18:27,673
Get up.

976
01:18:27,673 --> 01:18:30,673
(choking, gurgling)

977
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,606
(thuds, grunts)

978
01:18:57,243 --> 01:19:00,326
(mid tempo drumbeat)

979
01:19:03,386 --> 01:19:06,636
(anxious violin tones)

980
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:11,743
No more.

981
01:19:13,154 --> 01:19:13,987
Please.

982
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,613
- [Prison Guard] Drop it, Boland.

983
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,890
- [Jimmy] Go ahead, shoot.

984
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:43,960
Where do you think I'll fall?

985
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,793
Here?

986
01:19:46,455 --> 01:19:48,153
- We didn't do nothing, Boland.

987
01:19:48,153 --> 01:19:49,580
Now come on, don't.

988
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:53,140
- Go on Chinaman, you won't ever get out.

989
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,210
Do it.

990
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,973
- I don't wanna get out.

991
01:19:57,015 --> 01:19:59,074
- We didn't kill that old
nigger, we didn't do it honestly.

992
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:00,900
- Nigger?

993
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,817
- It's words man, come
on, it's just words man.

994
01:20:03,817 --> 01:20:07,387
- You got any more, you
better say 'em fast.

995
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:11,728
- [Clint] Boland, look out.

996
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:13,383
- Boland.

997
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:14,603
Come on, walk away.

998
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,470
- You ready to go?
- Do it.

999
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:19,490
- All right man, all right
we get it man, we did it.

1000
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:21,237
- Shut up!
- What'd you do?

1001
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:23,490
- Diddler and Stark man, we did it.

1002
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,510
We killed 'em both,
now come on please man.

1003
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:27,847
- Yeah mother fucker, we did it.

1004
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:31,602
We got the rat and the old man.

1005
01:20:31,602 --> 01:20:33,102
What you gonna do?

1006
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,247
- You heard that.

1007
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,810
- Fuck you Boland, fuck you.

1008
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,643
Fuck you.

1009
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,703
Fuck you, Boland.

1010
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:53,603
- Now do your job.

1011
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,220
- Get everybody locked down.

1012
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:05,500
Get the injured men to the
infirmary, clear this area.

1013
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,610
- Mr. Goddard, would you
care to make a statement?

1014
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,450
- Yes of course, well as you can see,

1015
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:13,340
we once again restored
order to this institution.

1016
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,603
- Don't you think it's
a little late for that?

1017
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:17,882
- What do you mean, Connie?

1018
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:22,120
- You can watch it on
the six o'clock news.

1019
01:21:26,234 --> 01:21:28,644
(somber piano, trumpet music)

1020
01:21:28,644 --> 01:21:31,811
- [Prison Guard] Ready on the lock-in.

1021
01:21:35,883 --> 01:21:38,883
(cell door buzzing)

1022
01:21:45,202 --> 01:21:46,119
11 o'clock,

1023
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:49,066
lights out, lights out.

1024
01:22:35,315 --> 01:22:39,148
(relaxed piano, guitar music)

1025
01:22:57,113 --> 01:22:58,723
- I won't lie to you, Stark.

1026
01:23:00,862 --> 01:23:03,112
It's a hell of a good
thing to have you gone.

1027
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,020
- It's a hell of a good thing to be going.

1028
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:20,370
- You planning on causing
us any more trouble?

1029
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:25,463
- Plenty.

1030
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,343
Well son,

1031
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:43,513
I can't say I'm gonna miss
this place but I will miss you.

1032
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:48,943
Gonna be doing some legal
work for you on the outside,

1033
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:51,520
get you outta here.

1034
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:58,221
You know I wish you'd reconsider
about taking over for me.

1035
01:23:58,221 --> 01:24:00,521
The guys on the inside
are gonna need someone.

1036
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,777
(relaxed ensemble music)

1037
01:24:17,407 --> 01:24:18,657
On the outside.

1038
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:21,258
- Outside.

1039
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:04,330
- [Prison Guard] Let's go, counselor.

1040
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,327
(relaxed ensemble music)

1041
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:09,511
(relaxed ensemble music)

1042
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:09,504
(relaxed ensemble music)
