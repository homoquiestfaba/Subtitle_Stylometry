1
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,734
Brenda. Brenda.
Brenda.

2
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,297
- Brenda.
- Yes?

3
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,309
- Mrs. Doyle?
- Yes?

4
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,404
- Can I help you?
- I am Art Dodge from Art's Gallery on Lincoln Road.

5
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,178
- I have Mr. Doyle's painting.
- Painting?

6
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,312
Yeah, the one
he bought last week.

7
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,879
My husband?
Benjamin Doyle?

8
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,825
<i>Please accept my condolences.
He was a wonderful man, a wonderful man.</i>

9
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,989
I never knew Benjamin
to be interested in art.

10
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:49,091
He was.
He really was.

11
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:15,084
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning.</i>

12
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,561
- Business letter?
- What business?

13
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,724
I'm writing my mother for money.
I've given up asking you.

14
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,734
- Any calls?
- No.

15
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:27,171
- Come on. None?
- Power and Light, Ma Bell, Sammy's Deli.

16
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,333
I don't want to know.
I'm dead.

17
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,071
- Well, that should simplify matters for somebody.
- Who?

18
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,979
Hillerman. He says he's gonna kill you
for up to six months' back rent.

19
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,353
- You remind me of my father.
- Is that a proposition?

20
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,363
Come on.

21
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,559
You both love to read
the obituaries.

22
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,006
Oops.

23
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,350
<i>- Hola, Conchita.
- Ah, Mrs...</i>

24
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,320
<i>- Uh, Miss Kerner, please come in.
- Thank you.</i>

25
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:26,154
- The service is private.
- I'd like to see Mr. Palletto.

26
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,386
<i>- El senor?
- El senor.</i>

27
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:32,192
<i>- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- What's the matter, Conchita?</i>

28
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:36,133
Excuse me, I am Art Dodge
from Art's Gallery on Lincoln Road...

29
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,932
and I have the painting
Mr. Palletto bought last week.

30
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,496
I said I'd
deliver it today.

31
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,737
- I think you better come in.
- Sure.

32
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,590
You want me to believe
my dad bought that?

33
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,533
Oh, it was your father?
I-I'm sorry. Eh, well, maybe...

34
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,867
Maybe this is not
the right moment, but yeah.

35
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,430
Last Monday
at my gallery.

36
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,308
That's strange.
Last Monday Dad was in a hospital.

37
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,878
- Did I say "last Monday"?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,614
Maybe... maybe it was
two Mondays ago.

39
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,624
All I know is it was
definitely a Monday.

40
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,820
What's definite is you're
a son of a bitch...

41
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,829
with no respect
for a dead man...

42
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,388
or his family's
suffering.

43
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,399
But you're lucky.

44
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,633
I'm going to help you understand
what suffering is.

45
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:57,242
Eh... I-I-I can come back
another time.

46
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,551
My father hated
modern art.

47
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,556
He thought the people
who made it were pansies...

48
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,554
and the people
who bought it were suckers.

49
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,722
But they love it.

50
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,998
When they get through
with you...

51
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,335
your face is gonna look
like a Picasso.

52
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,341
Wait, wait, wait.

53
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,505
Maybe this is all
a big misunderstanding.

54
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,515
What did you say
your father's name was?

55
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,516
Let me in.

56
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,998
- I'm sorry, Mama.
- Thank you. Thank you, dear.

57
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,010
Thanks for coming,
Betty.

58
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,014
Good-bye, Gene.

59
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,115
You have my
deepest sympathy.

60
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,781
No. You have mine.

61
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,484
Oh.

62
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,629
I hope time heals all your...

63
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,960
- You're pushing it, pal.
- Pain.

64
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,660
Maria, take care
of Mama.

65
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,103
<i>Betty. Betty.
We need to talk.</i>

66
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,403
<i>I have nothing to say to you, Gene. I
only came out of respect for your father.</i>

67
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,443
Well, Betty, look.
I'm in bad shape.

68
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,105
I'm at home crying my eyes out,
and you're out having a good time.

69
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,548
I'd be having a better time if you
didn't follow me everywhere I went.

70
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,917
You know the happiest day
of my father's life?

71
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,218
The day you and I
got married.

72
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,554
- You know the happiest day of my life?
- What?

73
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,026
The day we got divorced.

74
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,586
- Now get out of my way and leave me alone, you big bully.
- Ooh. Ow.

75
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,599
Betty, Betty.
I'm seeing Dr. Huffeyer.

76
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,967
Oh, great.
That's just great.

77
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,838
Out of all the shrinks in Miami,
you have to go see mine?

78
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,433
Well, I'm not gonna see him anymore because
I don't want to share anything with you...

79
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,878
- not even this planet!
- He's helping me change.

80
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,919
- I'm channeling all my anger
into some positive crap.

81
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,114
Listen to me, damn it!
I've changed! Ow!

82
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,387
I love you!

83
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,648
<i>You can come out now.</i>

84
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,712
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

85
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,555
That was exciting,
with those big lugs looking for you...

86
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:11,562
and Gene standing there
not knowing you were in the back seat.

87
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,326
I had a hunch something great
was gonna happen today.

88
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,891
<i>- It did. I'm still alive.
- Yeah.</i>

89
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:23,374
- Sorry.
- For now. Thanks to you.

90
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,535
I'm Betty.
Betty Kerner.

91
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,911
- Art Dodge.
- It's really nice to meet you, Art.

92
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:34,681
<i>Same here, Betty.</i>

93
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,920
I guess you are not
going downtown, right?

94
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,585
Uh-uh.

95
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,568
Let me see if you got this right.

96
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,578
<i>- Arriba.
- Arriba.</i>

97
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,580
<i>- Abajo.
- Abajo.</i>

98
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,242
<i>- Al centro.
- Al centro.</i>

99
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,649
<i>- Por dentro.
- Por dentro.</i>

100
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,290
Mmm.

101
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,457
I'm loaded.
Um, what about you?

102
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,589
No.

103
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,760
No, I cry too much.
Don't you ever cry?

104
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,932
Oh, yeah, sure I do. Whenever I
pay taxes, which isn't often anyway.

105
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,338
- You're crazy.
- So are you.

106
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,344
A match made in heaven.

107
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,983
A very long,
pretty blond eyelash.

108
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,488
- Take it with your finger.
- Yeah.

109
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,047
- Okay.
- Make a wish.

110
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,153
- Okay.
- Blow it away.

111
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,634
<i>Who is it?</i>

112
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,640
<i>It's Ellen, darling. Open up.</i>

113
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,973
Oh, gee, in a second.
Just...

114
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,274
<i>Oof!</i>

115
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,807
Oh. Ohh!

116
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,357
I was right.

117
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,727
A match made in heaven.

118
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,495
Hey, that's
Betty Kerner.

119
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,659
And who's that bimbo
with her?

120
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,669
Let's check it out.

121
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,671
Hmm.

122
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,197
They say that the
third time is the charm.

123
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,244
Third what?

124
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,746
- Marriage.
- Oh.

125
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,773
Who was the first?

126
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,682
Gene.

127
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,687
- Who was the second?
- Gene.

128
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,690
You married that guy
twice?

129
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,591
Now ask me who's
gonna be the third.

130
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,858
Miss Kerner. Hey, Miss Kerner,
who's your new friend?

131
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,900
- Eh...
- My fiancé.

132
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,639
Cool.

133
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,503
One, two, three!

134
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,595
<i>Aah!</i>

135
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,278
Boom, boom!
Can you guess what I am thinking?

136
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,288
Can you guess
what I'm thinking?

137
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,620
I'm sorry.

138
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,218
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.
I-I-I thought that...

139
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,490
You can go out
the same way you came in.

140
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,261
Sure. Uh...
I'm sorry.

141
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,735
<i>Wild guess,
but are these yours?</i>

142
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,268
Yes.

143
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,275
Sorry.

144
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,915
- I'm sorry.
- I know. Now try "good-bye."

145
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,508
Good-bye.

146
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,824
<i>Oh, Dios.</i>

147
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,861
<i>But I have to have it fitted tomorrow.</i>

148
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,056
<i>Ciao.</i>

149
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,191
<i>- How long have you known him?
- Seems like forever.</i>

150
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,827
<i>Oh, less than
24 hours then.</i>

151
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,771
Oh, yes, Hopper.
Of course you can be the flower dog.

152
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,901
<i>Right?</i>

153
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:36,141
<i>So do I get a new bridesmaid's getup, or should
I just put some more miles on the old one?</i>

154
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,151
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

155
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:44,747
<i>- You've met my sister Liz already.
- Yeah.</i>

156
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,291
<i>Lay down, now.</i>

157
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,886
Hello?

158
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,627
No, no, no, the invitations should read
"The Honorable Art Dodge," don't you think?

159
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,499
- The invitations?
- Yeah. Engraved.

160
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,800
And they should be
in the mail by Tuesday.

161
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,205
Okay. Ciao.
Fantastic. Bye.

162
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,711
- Betty, can I talk to you alone?
- Yeah, in one second.

163
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,144
In one second.

164
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,507
Father Larrabee.

165
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,814
He's on the golf course?

166
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,823
<i>- Wow, you hooked yourself the big one, didn't you?
- Do you have a cellular number?</i>

167
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,054
This must go way beyond
your wildest little gigolo dreams.

168
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,563
<i>Okay. Thanks.
Isn't he adorable?</i>

169
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,794
- Yeah.
- Betty, we need to talk.

170
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,927
- Wait.
- What about? Your allowance?

171
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,097
<i>- Father Larrabee, it's Betty.
- Look...</i>

172
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,768
<i>- I don't need to. I've seen enough.
- It's good? Great.</i>

173
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,370
No, no. He's a different one.

174
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,438
Yes, but he's wonderful,
and you'll love him.

175
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,110
<i>I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.</i>

176
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,587
So how does
the third sound?

177
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,420
It's my birthday.
I'll be 33.

178
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:58,225
<i>It's my third wedding,
and three is my lucky number.</i>

179
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,164
- Great. Great.
- Yes?

180
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,693
- Eh, I've got to go to work.
- It has a job. How refreshing.

181
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,039
<i>- Gotta go. Bye.
- Have a good day.</i>

182
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,202
Come on, buddy.
Come on, boy.

183
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,237
- I don't think she likes me.
- Oh, don't listen to her.

184
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:22,481
She's been involved with this guy who's a
married man. It's been a really bad deal.

185
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,762
<i>I see congratulations
are in order.</i>

186
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,668
I am not getting married.
It's like a big misunderstanding.

187
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,434
<i>- Okay?
- Oh, so, like, you've explained it to her...</i>

188
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,771
and everything's all
straightened out for ya?

189
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,108
<i>- Well, no, not exactly.
- Uh-huh.</i>

190
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,774
<i>Everything is totally
high or low with her.</i>

191
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,943
She'll be down on me soon enough,
and then it'll all be over.

192
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,817
Trust me. She's a girl
with big extremes.

193
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,255
So I see.
Manny's in there.

194
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,259
He's been in there
for an hour.

195
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,057
- Come on, Gloria.
- What do you want me to do?

196
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,928
I feel sorry for the guy.
We owe him for two paintings.

197
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,061
Is the I RS in there?
Maybe you feel sorry for everyone I owe.

198
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:16,301
Everyone? No.
I don't believe in self-pity.

199
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,208
Manny. Just the man
I wanted to see.

200
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,738
- Art.
- What's that?

201
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:29,515
Wow!
This is terrific.

202
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,148
- I can sell it in a week.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

203
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,419
- It's been hanging here for three months.
- Really?

204
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,189
I'm taking them all home.

205
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>- Art?
- Yeah?</i>

206
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,432
You still haven't paid me
for the last two.

207
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,834
Wha...
You should thank me.

208
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,931
Manny,
if Vincent van Gogh...

209
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,533
had been paid
for his paintings...

210
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,341
they would be worthless
today.

211
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:59,111
You shouldn't be thinking about money.
You're an artist.

212
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,881
You're a real one.
I can see that in your eyes.

213
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,720
Huh? Yeah, yeah!
Believe me. Yeah.

214
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,618
You know...
You know, Manny...

215
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,063
Manny, go home and paint.

216
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,624
Paint, Manny, paint.
Come on. Eh?

217
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,900
- Yeah, yeah. Maybe you're right.
- Yeah, I'm right.

218
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,907
- But what about you?
- What about me? What? What?

219
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:28,275
- You were good.
- Good is the same as bad.

220
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,713
It has to be brilliant.

221
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,751
Yeah. So why is it
hanging on your wall?

222
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,618
Well, it's just, uh...

223
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,717
reminding me not
to pick up a brush again.

224
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:46,855
Yeah. You like it?
Take it.

225
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:51,926
It's yours. Consider it an advance
on what I owe you.

226
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,937
Huh?

227
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,602
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

228
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,205
Real artists
don't need words.

229
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,084
Eh?

230
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,752
All right.

231
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,382
Good-bye.
See you, huh?

232
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,338
- What's Manny doing with your painting?
- I'm redecorating.

233
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,404
It was the nicest thing
in here.

234
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,653
Excuse me, miss.

235
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,256
You have a provocative
work of art here.

236
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,597
May I take it home
and live with it for a few days...

237
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,603
before I make
my final decision?

238
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,765
And which work of art
would that be?

239
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,470
You. You're the most
beautiful one here.

240
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,379
No, I will not go home
with you, Mr. Dodge.

241
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,715
I'm sorry. Have we met?
See, sometimes my memory fails me.

242
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:19,746
I-I have...
Korsakov's Syndrome, which means...

243
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:24,558
If it means always hitting on me,
I'd say you have a terminal case.

244
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,224
- Art, your dad's here.
- l...

245
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,663
Dad, what are you doing here?
I told you I'd pick you up.

246
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,899
I wanted to save you
the trouble.

247
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:40,502
<i>The last time you saved me the trouble, I
had to track you down at the police station.</i>

248
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,570
I was not lost.

249
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,241
I was arrested for demonstrating against
the death penalty.

250
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,014
Me and my comrades
from the Lincoln Brigade.

251
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,021
Did I ever show you
my scar?

252
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,115
- She has seen it.
- It's a lovely scar, Mr. Dodge.

253
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:58,492
I'm the only man alive
with two navels.

254
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,978
What's this?

255
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,709
We live in a big, red,
horrible building.

256
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,978
That was in Madrid,
remember?

257
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:25,284
We moved here four years ago
when Mom died.

258
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,155
Your mother was a fine woman.
Don't drag her into this.

259
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,558
Come on.
Well, this is our home now.

260
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,961
I know that.
You got the big room.

261
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,056
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

262
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:39,797
- You have the one with the best ventilation.
- That's true.

263
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,073
<i>Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.</i>

264
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:50,080
<i>Ooh, yes! Yes.
That is exactly what I want.</i>

265
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:54,983
Hold on. Okay, one cake with the three
in Roman numerals.

266
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,817
That way each one
can be a different flavor.

267
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,916
One could be vanilla, one could be
carrot, and one could be strawberry.

268
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:05,588
What? Ooh, mocha.
Mmm, that sounds good.

269
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,360
Should we lose the vanilla
or the strawberry?

270
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,994
- Betty, we need to talk and...
- He wants to talk about it.

271
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,004
<i>- I'll call you back. Good-bye.
- Excuse me.</i>

272
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,509
I am not losing the carrot.
God, you are so gorgeous.

273
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,445
You know that? You're gonna look
so good with me up at the altar.

274
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,382
- Eh, excuse us a second. Can you come here?
- Yeah.

275
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,756
Eh...

276
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,384
Listen, Betty, um...

277
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,191
I-I couldn't sleep
last night, uh...

278
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,165
Um... I don't know where to begin.

279
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,464
You are so... special.

280
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,471
Mmm.

281
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,633
Yeah. One in a million.
A real lifesaver.

282
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,904
- I-I owe you big time.
- No.

283
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,812
But, you know,
I was thinking...

284
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:00,647
"Betty is just too good
for me."

285
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,781
It's like a voice
that says...

286
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:09,259
"Art, you don't
deserve her."

287
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,455
- It... um...
- What are you saying?

288
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,623
A-All I am saying...

289
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,190
is... is just... wow.

290
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,704
Two weeks. Is that long enough?
I mean, marriage.

291
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:24,765
Huge in the decision
department, right? Huh?

292
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,388
- What the hell did you do to my sister?
- Nothing, nothing.

293
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,391
- l...
- Don't you hurt her.

294
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,054
All I said to her was
that we were moving a little too fast.

295
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,360
I thought guys like you
always moved too fast.

296
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,027
If you're gonna play the stud,
at least have the common decency...

297
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,070
to do it well
and make her happy.

298
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,650
Betty...

299
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,854
I'm sorry.

300
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:14,051
- I really didn't mean to upset you.
- Oh, darling, I'm strong.

301
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,992
I spoke to Dr. Huffeyer...

302
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,327
and he said that as long as
I externalize my feelings...

303
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,630
without inhibition...
even my anger...

304
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,796
then everything is fine.

305
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,362
So I'm fine.

306
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,376
And I don't want you
to feel that you can't be...

307
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,469
completely honest with me...

308
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,949
because marriage needs to be based
on openness and trust...

309
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,418
as well as basic
sexual compatibility.

310
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,157
Everything is fine.

311
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,626
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

312
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,061
Everything is fantastic.

313
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,631
- Good.
- Except for your sister.

314
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:04,073
Uh... I don't think
she's too crazy about me.

315
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,771
- Well, that's because you're not her type.
- Huh?

316
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,907
I mean, she teaches modern
art at the university, for God's sake.

317
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,687
<i>She goes for those
quasi-intellectual types...</i>

318
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,122
with the glasses
and the frown lines...

319
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,955
<i>and Siberian movies.</i>

320
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,458
<i>Don't. I don't want
to hear it anymore.</i>

321
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,037
<i>You're not gonna leave her.</i>

322
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,013
She knows it.
You know it.

323
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,449
And finally,
I know it.

324
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,617
<i>Bye.</i>

325
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,738
- What's this?
- Mrs. Doyle returned it.

326
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,315
What kind of country
is this...

327
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,580
where people don't even
respect the last wishes of the dead?

328
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,954
Shall I read you the mail or throw it
directly into the wastebasket?

329
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,000
You should only read
love letters.

330
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,661
But they are love letters.

331
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,670
Here's a love letter
from the bank...

332
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,230
and one from the
insurance company...

333
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:48,405
and, ooh,
very romantic.

334
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,277
A letter
from your optician...

335
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,546
accompanied, of course,
by the bill for your last contacts.

336
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,521
Bills, bills, bills.

337
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,184
Is that all people
ever think about?

338
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,387
What if I don't pay? What are
they gonna do, gouge my eyes out?

339
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,692
I wouldn't give them
any ideas.

340
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,240
Pay the man.

341
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,659
Is Mr. Dodge in?

342
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:46,932
Do me a favor and tell my brother Arthur
to stop playing hide-and-seek with me.

343
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,940
<i>Tell him I need to
speak to him tonight, you understand?</i>

344
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:56,010
- Uh, Mr. Dodge.
- You are looking for my brother too?

345
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,983
<i>If you see him before I do,
please tell him I am in town.</i>

346
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,797
Tell him I am in town.

347
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,805
Tell him...

348
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,475
Bart is in town.

349
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,570
Art Dodge, please.

350
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,102
Someone who sounds like Art
calling for Art.

351
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,617
- Hello?
- Hello. I'm calling Art Dodge.

352
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,621
His gallery said I could
reach him at this number.

353
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,385
Fifteen minutes?
I'll call back.

354
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,988
It's his brother, Bart.

355
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,123
All right. Fine.
Bye.

356
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,132
Fine, fine. Fine.

357
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,776
Gloria, it's me.
Listen, it's important.

358
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,580
Call me at Betty's
in exactly, uh...

359
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,586
twenty minutes.

360
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,693
Hi.

361
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,096
Hi.

362
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,626
- Oh, your brother called.
- What? What did you say?

363
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,264
She said your brother called.
What's the matter? Is he dead?

364
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,538
- Since when do you have a brother?
- Since I was 12 minutes old.

365
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,671
- You're twins?
- Yeah.

366
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,840
Huh. Absolutely identical.
Yeah.

367
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,941
That's a happy thought.

368
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,182
Well, we look the same, but,
uh, we've got nothing in common.

369
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:22,716
I mean, he paints, he
broods, he lives for his art.

370
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,728
He doesn't even like
to sell it.

371
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,390
Maybe he just likes
what he does.

372
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,956
Yeah, who knows?
It takes all kinds.

373
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:34,596
You know what? He burns some of
his paintings. He's... He's crazy.

374
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,971
That sounds like a colossal
waste of time to me.

375
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,374
Sounds like he might
even be a human being.

376
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,538
<i>- When was the last time you saw him?
- Years.</i>

377
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,980
<i>Last I heard, he was in Italy.</i>

378
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,450
Sorry.

379
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,453
<i>Hello?</i>

380
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,990
Yeah. Hold on.
It's for you.

381
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,583
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,186
Really?

383
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,429
- Hello?
- At the tone, the time will be...

384
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,993
exactly 8:30.
Beep.

385
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,938
Gloria, Gloria.
Have you got Bart there?

386
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,601
- I just don't know how to answer that one.
- Let me talk to him.

387
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,670
There must be an easier way
to get a girl into the sack.

388
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,045
Bart? Oh, God!

389
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,449
I can't believe
it's you, man!

390
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,545
I can't believe this is how I'm
using my degree in architecture.

391
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,022
How long are you here for?
What are your plans?

392
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,322
Met this guy a couple of days
ago, works for Sentinel Express.

393
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,227
Maybe we'll have a few drinks. I'll
check out his overnight delivery.

394
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,231
You know, I really
want to see you.

395
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,826
Your relationships with women are
getting more and more bizarre, Art.

396
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,701
- You want to get that looked at.
- When can we get together?

397
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,967
Maybe you should try the
personals. You know what I mean?

398
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,305
- I see, I see.
- Have you considered masturbation?

399
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,311
Well, I can't
promise anything.

400
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,813
<i>Oh, come on.
Promise me something.</i>

401
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,750
- Okay, we'll talk tomorrow.
- Sure, if you're still alive and out of a straitjacket.

402
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,811
- Seriously. Look after yourself,
will ya?

403
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,655
You now owe me four weeks' salary.

404
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,160
- Okay, okay. See you. All right?
- Okay.

405
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,389
Bye, bye, bye.

406
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,398
This guy is incredible.

407
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,400
Love to meet your family.

408
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,562
Personally, I'd rather meet
the Manson family.

409
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,368
"Furthermore,
Mr. President...

410
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,069
"the situation in Algiers
is a disaster.

411
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,342
<i>Dad, Bart's in Miami.</i>

412
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,441
"And the firing...

413
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:31,784
"of the surgeon general...

414
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,626
<i>"was a major...</i>

415
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,697
"mistake.

416
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,400
What a woman."

417
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:49,701
I said Bart is in town.

418
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,607
That's nice.

419
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,804
You... You know who
Bart is, don't you?

420
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,813
Of course I do.

421
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,044
I mean, your son,
my twin brother.

422
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,746
- I know who Bart is!
- Okay, okay, okay.

423
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:07,416
Just because, uh, someone might
call and want to talk to him.

424
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,925
Or you... you might meet
someone who mentions him to you.

425
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:13,088
I just don't want you to act like you've
never heard of him. You know what I mean?

426
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,133
Believe me, if I'm gonna forget
either son...

427
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,430
it'll be you.

428
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,436
Thank you.

429
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,813
I'm not going to help you!

430
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,784
The next time you're in a jam, I'd
prefer you were straight with me!

431
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,787
I knew it.
I mean, yes, yes.

432
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:42,121
Your brain works just fine when
something's in it for you, of course.

433
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:46,129
Listen, you son of a bitch,
and may your mother forgive me.

434
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,529
What is this bullshit
all about?

435
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,864
Well, I was just trying to get you
to help me without having to ask you.

436
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,666
- That's all.
- So ask me.

437
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:58,266
- I'm your father, right?
- Ah.

438
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,004
Is it money or women?

439
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,709
No, it's...
You don't have to help me.

440
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,344
No, no, you don't want to,
you don't have to do it.

441
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,945
- Money or women?
- Women.

442
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,118
<i>Is she... special?</i>

443
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,130
So what's the problem?

444
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,195
- I'm gonna get married.
- It's about time.

445
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,465
To her sister.

446
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:34,310
Oh.

447
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,508
Her sister.

448
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:42,211
This... This twin...

449
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,720
with the idiotic name.

450
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,280
H-He's going to
fix all that?

451
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,089
- Damned if I know. Huh.
- Hmm.

452
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,641
Listen, any second now a woman is
gonna walk in here asking for me.

453
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,578
Tell her I am not in, but she
can speak to my brother Bart.

454
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,582
<i>Bart. Get it?</i>

455
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,281
Yeah, I lie to the woman you're engaged
to, but it's not as bad as it sounds.

456
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,290
I get it. Mm-hmm.

457
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,738
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

458
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,748
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

459
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,546
I'm looking for
Mr. Art Dodge.

460
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,247
- He's not in at the moment.
- Oh.

461
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:56,885
<i>But if you like, you can
speak with his brother... Bart.</i>

462
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,158
Bart's here?
Oh, I'd love to meet him.

463
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,792
- You mean you don't know him?
- Well, he just arrived from Italy.

464
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,962
Ohh! Of course.

465
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,465
And who shall I say
is here?

466
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,668
Betty Kerner,
Art's fiancée.

467
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,876
- Bart?
- Yes?

468
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,751
Your... brother's
fiancée is here.

469
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,588
- A Miss Kerner.
- Please, uh, send her in.

470
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,693
Right this way.

471
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,636
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

472
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,536
So, you are Betty.

473
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,445
I'm surprised.

474
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,451
So am I.

475
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,987
You're not at all alike.

476
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:04,092
My brother is obviously attracting
more perceptive women these days.

477
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,494
Thank you.
What do you mean, "these days"?

478
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,125
Well, let's just say...

479
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,795
the girls he used to
bring around...

480
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,395
didn't have your class...

481
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,941
or subtlety.

482
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:21,466
My brother has
a certain charm.

483
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,072
But don't you find him
a little... boring...

484
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,277
a bit, um, limited?

485
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,650
Not yet.

486
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,655
Art says you're an artist.

487
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:37,888
You can't really say that about a person
until he's been dead at least, uh, ten years.

488
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,487
What a point of view.

489
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,498
That's so pedantic.

490
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,431
- Eh?
- I mean romantic.

491
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,663
Ah.

492
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,069
My sister
would love you.

493
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,074
Why don't you come by with
Art for dinner tonight?

494
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,838
And you can talk about art
and the meaning of life.

495
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,506
- l-l-l...
- I won't take no for an answer.

496
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,948
- 9:00.
- Okay. Okay.

497
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,452
I can't wait
for my brother.

498
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,821
Miss Fletcher,
if my brother shows up...

499
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,386
please tell him
I need to speak to him.

500
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,898
Betty, a pleasure.

501
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,900
Until tonight, then.

502
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,300
Yeah. Tonight.

503
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,695
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

504
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:13,156
<i>- Betty! You been here long?
- No.</i>

505
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,885
- I met your brother.
- Ohh.

506
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,554
- You're right. He's very complicated.
- Yeah.

507
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,620
But you know what?
He would make a great best man.

508
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:25,533
Fabulous idea!
He'll love that.

509
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,798
I-I am not sure.

510
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,805
- I'll check it out.
- Okay.

511
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:34,003
<i>Your brother wants you to call
him anyway. It sounded important.</i>

512
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:38,674
Darling, would you wait for
me in the car? I won't be long.

513
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,343
Okay. You'll be
at the wedding?

514
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,683
- Wouldn't miss it.
- Okay.

515
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,726
<i>You know, I don't mind lying about
the check being in the mail...</i>

516
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,931
or that some kid's
the new Jackson Pollock...

517
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:07,535
but I just don't think $7.50
an hour covers whatever this is.

518
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,172
Well, you choose.

519
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,012
It's that or back
to the suicide hot line.

520
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,182
- Art?
- What now?

521
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,023
My name is Gloria. Don't you
ever call me Miss Fletcher again.

522
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,100
What are you doing here? Why do
you follow me everyplace that I go?

523
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,398
I'm not following you. I'm looking out
for you. Someone's gotta protect you.

524
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,904
<i>- You can't take care of yourself.
- I don't want your protection.</i>

525
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,908
<i>- I want you to leave me alone.
- What are you doing with this guy?</i>

526
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,570
Yeah, Art, Art, it's...
it's great to see you again.

527
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,739
You know, Betty's been saying
such wonderful things about you.

528
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,010
Don't touch him!
Don't even get near him.

529
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,349
I'm just trying to congratulate him. Anyone
who makes you happy makes me happy.

530
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,015
You are not fooling me, Gene.
I know you.

531
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,957
No, you know the old Gene. I'm not
the same guy. I mean, give me a chance.

532
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,961
l... here. Here.
I brought you some flowers.

533
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,963
- Thank you.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

534
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,965
- I'm just a warmhearted guy.
- Wh... What are you...

535
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,967
- Hey! Hey!
- What... What are you doing?

536
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,970
What are you doing?
Giving him the kiss of death?

537
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,208
Kiss of death? What kiss of death?
What is that?

538
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,719
He kisses you,
you're history.

539
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:27,223
<i>- Didn't you ever see The Godfather?
- Which one?</i>

540
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,565
- Just a moment, sir.
- Sure.

541
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,808
<i>You must be Bart.</i>

542
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,481
And you must be Liz.

543
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,914
So Art told you about me?

544
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:02,015
Well, eh, he tells me
that you two...

545
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,287
got off
on the wrong foot.

546
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,853
That's a very artful way of putting it.

547
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,161
Yeah, I suppose it is.

548
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,795
- I know he comes off as a little, uh...
- Slick?

549
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,896
Uh, slick.
Really?

550
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,373
- I think he's cool.
- Cool, slick. Whatever.

551
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,843
It's... it fits him.
He's a very smooth operator.

552
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,075
He had to be to survive.

553
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:29,210
- Survive what?
- Well, we grew up without any money.

554
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:34,155
You know, I was an artist,
and the kids used to kick my ass all the time.

555
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,022
<i>- He protected me.
- Hello, Bart.</i>

556
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:40,552
- Hi.
- Hi. Art just called and he can't come.

557
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,998
He said there's some kind of problem
with your dad?

558
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:48,026
Yeah, the old man's got Korsakov's Syndrome.
You know, memory problems.

559
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,006
Well, it was very nice of Art
to let you come.

560
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,737
Very nice. He's got
a very nice side to him.

561
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,214
Dinner's out
on the veranda.

562
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,149
- This way.
- Oh.

563
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,085
- This is a very nice house, hmm?
- Thank you.

564
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,885
- Wow.
- Glad you came?

565
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,189
For me,
there is only Rimbaud.

566
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,025
Rimbaud. Why?

567
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:17,362
Well, it's obvious.
He's the original.

568
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,268
I mean, Seagal and Van Damme
are just cheap imitations.

569
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:26,201
I admire him because
he had the good sense...

570
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,471
to quit while he
was still ahead.

571
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,844
I disagree.
I think that two sequels was plenty.

572
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:37,153
Honey, Rimbaud, not Rambo.
Poet, French, dead.

573
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:41,453
I'm just trying to change the
subject before I fall asleep...

574
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,459
<i>face down in my plate.</i>

575
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,894
So are you saying that all artists
should quit when they're 18?

576
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:51,196
Well, no, but th-they should
have enough sense to stop...

577
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,202
when their best work
is behind them.

578
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,932
You're not gonna
smoke that, are you?

579
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,940
No, I'm gonna eat it.

580
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,291
Excuse me.

581
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,461
My ex-brother-in-law.
He's big on drama.

582
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,563
Unlike your sister.

583
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,769
Get off of my dock,
you maniac.

584
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:38,645
<i>Are you crazy? Somebody should
take you away and, and lock you up.</i>

585
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,979
Do you know what day
this is, darling?

586
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:46,250
- Yeah, it's the day they take out the trash.
- It's our anniversary.

587
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:50,020
No, it's not.
Our anniversary is June 8.

588
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,960
Our second anniversary.

589
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,964
You came all the way here
to tell me that?

590
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,365
I've been paying Dr. Huffeyer a lot
of money so that I could forget it.

591
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:11,677
<i>Remember the church in Cabo?</i>

592
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,945
<i>That funny little priest.</i>

593
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,987
The burro that ate my bouquet.

594
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,056
It's not gonna work.

595
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,961
No, but the music
is great.

596
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,601
Why, thank you.

597
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,006
Hi, there.

598
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,274
Go for it.

599
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:56,052
Fireworks and flowers are not gonna
do it, Gene, and neither are mariachi.

600
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,653
They were playing this song.

601
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,332
These are the guys.
I flew 'em in first class.

602
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:08,269
I even had to get Pablo out of prison,
so it would be perfect for you.

603
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,641
Dance with me?

604
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:18,772
Go away.

605
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,084
Please?

606
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,688
One last time.

607
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:29,954
On my honor, I-I'll
never bother you again.

608
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,163
Dance with me?

609
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,375
Have you ever been married?

610
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,384
- No.
- Never.

611
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,656
- Hopper.
- Oh.

612
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,387
So Hopper is, uh,
illegitimate.

613
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,895
Yeah.

614
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,822
Would that little monkey
of yours do this for you?

615
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:45,857
Ooh! If there's an ape
in my life, it's you.

616
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:51,038
- Get out of here!
- What did I do?

617
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:58,571
<i>Of all the manipulative,
scum-sucking... Good night.</i>

618
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,617
- Good night.
- I hate you, Eugene Palletto.

619
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,619
So, eh...

620
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,022
do we have to
stop dancing?

621
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,026
- No.
- Nah.

622
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,529
It's as if he wants me to be, like, this
perfect housewife, but we're not even married.

623
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,541
It's so ridiculous.

624
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:29,340
Then afterwards, you know, it's
really hard for me to be mad at him...

625
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,347
- for too long because I love him so...
- But that's the point.

626
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,942
The machine
creates the tension.

627
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,681
- Bart?
- Hi.

628
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,019
- Hi.
- What a surprise. What are you doing here?

629
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,685
- I work here.
- Uh, that's right, that's right.

630
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,456
- You have time for a coffee?
- Yeah.

631
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,464
- Good. Let's go.
- Okay.

632
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,467
Okay, guys, it was very nice
talking to you, huh?

633
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,469
<i>- Bye-bye.
- All right. Bye.</i>

634
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,471
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

635
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,736
Unfortunately, they don't emphasize
technique these days.

636
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:02,107
Perfect. You can smother an idea
with technique.

637
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,979
But these kids have things in their heads
they can't get down on paper.

638
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,540
What good is an idea
if it stays up here?

639
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:11,178
You might as well be
an artist who doesn't paint.

640
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,018
Now, that's my definition
of a coward.

641
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,496
Are you working now?

642
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,500
I can't seem to stop.

643
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,729
I'd love to see
some of your work.

644
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:30,136
But you just got here,
so there's probably nothing to show yet.

645
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,938
Actually, I shipped
a few pieces here and...

646
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,171
Really?

647
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:39,238
- If you got a little time...
- Now is good.

648
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,648
- Now?
- Yeah.

649
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,585
Um, okay, great, great.
Uh...

650
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:49,523
Just, uh, let me make a call,
and we're on our way.

651
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,527
Okay.

652
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,159
Manny, it's Art.
Listen.

653
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:02,035
You've got to come over to the gallery.
People are going nuts about you.

654
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,972
<i>Art's Gallery.</i>

655
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:09,102
Gloria, it's me. This is crucial.
You gotta do me a favor.

656
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,512
- Oh, joy.
- Look, Manny'll be there any minute.

657
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,517
- Is he gonna be a twin too?
- This is not a game.

658
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:19,544
- Keep him there for an hour.
- How do you propose I do that?

659
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:24,060
<i>Use your charm.</i>

660
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,383
<i>- I'm nervous. Uh...
- Don't be.</i>

661
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,621
<i>You're the first person
to see them in a long time.</i>

662
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,822
They are no big deal,
really.

663
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,695
<i>Bart, they're very good.
I like them.</i>

664
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,668
I like them a lot.

665
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,637
Good.

666
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:18,677
- Is that yours?
- Yeah.

667
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,546
- I love that.
- Yeah?

668
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,317
It's beautiful.
You know why?

669
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,288
No.

670
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,349
It's both simple
and heartfelt.

671
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,761
Keep it.

672
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,605
- What? Are you kidding?
- Take it. My gift.

673
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,043
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Of course you can.

674
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,138
I want you to have it.

675
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:57,416
Please.

676
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,887
Oh, I love this.

677
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,557
Good.

678
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,743
Well, I better go.

679
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:32,177
You were very talented.

680
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:36,207
<i>Todavia no se porque lo
dejaste. Este es muy bueno.</i>

681
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,776
- Hi.
- How was your swim?

682
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,389
Art's Gallery.

683
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,366
Gloria, any messages
for me?

684
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,666
Hillerman. He read about your, "merger
with the Kerner fortune..."

685
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,933
is, I believe,
how he put it...

686
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,874
- so he's raising the rent.
- Any other calls?

687
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,968
One, but it's not
for you.

688
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,980
If you see your brother Bart,
tell him I have a message for him.

689
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,175
Wait, wait, wait!

690
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:50,421
<i>Art's Gallery.</i>

691
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:54,486
Gloria, this is Bart.
Do I have any calls?

692
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:58,159
As it happens, a certain
Liz Kerner called.

693
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,327
She said
she'd call back.

694
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,133
Bart, I'm worried
about your brother.

695
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,902
You should be, Gloria.
We'll discuss it later.

696
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,502
I'm going to fix myself
a drink.

697
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,674
<i>- Anybody want anything?
- I'd love a vodka tonic.</i>

698
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,218
<i>- Liz, what about you?
- No, thanks.</i>

699
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,855
No, Hopper, it's not me. It's not me.

700
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,413
<i>No, cancel that order! Excuse me.</i>

701
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:48,245
Maria, could you use another phone?
Thank you.

702
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,082
What? What?
No, forget it!

703
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,679
<i>Don't accept those conditions.</i>

704
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,782
Hello?

705
00:59:56,859 --> 01:00:00,454
This is Bart Dodge.
May I speak to Liz, please?

706
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,961
- Hello?
- Liz? It's Bart.

707
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,129
- You called?
- Yeah.

708
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,730
We were having kind of
a lazy day here and...

709
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,743
You want to come by?
Your brother's here.

710
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,803
Can't make it
this afternoon.

711
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,976
Oh, how about dinner, then?
Just the two of us.

712
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,316
Sure. Good.
Much better.

713
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,583
9:00 okay?

714
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:31,491
- Can you make it a bit later?
- 9:30, then.

715
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,826
Let's compromise. 10:00.

716
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,764
Okay. You want to
talk to Art?

717
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,325
Sure. Put him on.

718
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,837
Okay, hold on a second.
Art!

719
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:56,017
- Phone for you. It's your brother.
- Oh.

720
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,076
- Can you hold that?
- Yeah.

721
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,089
Thanks. Thanks.

722
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,091
Um, Bart?

723
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:09,025
That's no problem.
Yeah. Yeah.

724
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:12,932
Sounds great. Yeah, well.
See you later.

725
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,436
Bye.

726
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,367
Yeah.
I forgot the ice.

727
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,384
- Here you are.
- Hmm. Thank you.

728
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,721
How's Bart?

729
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,758
Bart. Bart's fine.
He's fine.

730
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:39,852
<i>Very happy, actually.</i>

731
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:44,229
Eh, Betty, I got a problem
making dinner tonight, uh...

732
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,495
Miss this dinner,
my darling...

733
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:49,697
and your problems
are just beginning.

734
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,657
- Oh, la, la, monsieur.
- What?

735
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,719
If you permit me to say, you
are committing a hideous crime.

736
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:17,664
Doctors orders. It's the only
way she can take her medicine.

737
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:22,034
Monsieur, that is
a Chateau Fontegnac.

738
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,699
This is not a wine
to toy with.

739
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,504
<i>- Pardon.
- Look, buddy, it's my wine.</i>

740
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,511
I paid for it.

741
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,446
Now, if I want to piss in it,
that's my business.

742
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,951
<i>- Okay?
- As you wish, monsieur.</i>

743
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,286
<i>Espece de cochon.</i>

744
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,390
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

745
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,938
Thank you.

746
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,435
Cheers.

747
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,309
<i>Arriba. Abajo.</i>

748
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,974
<i>- Al centro.
- Por dentro.</i>

749
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:10,018
Whatever.

750
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:21,390
Mmm. Oof.

751
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:03,735
Ohh, Art,
I love you.

752
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,240
Hmm.

753
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:08,243
I know.

754
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,353
I'm sorry.

755
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,427
Huh.

756
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,005
I wanted to see if, um...

757
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,578
Aiieee! Ai, ai, ai!

758
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,693
It's always raining
when you need a cab.

759
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,738
Uh... do you think Art has
anything I could change into?

760
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,739
Upstairs?

761
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,900
Are you hungry?

762
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,245
Famished.

763
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:56,308
- Here?
- Yeah. Do you know it?

764
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,819
I had dinner here
not too long ago.

765
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,266
It's okay.

766
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,833
- People sure stare at you.
- No, they're looking at you.

767
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,071
<i>Nice to see you again,
monsieur.</i>

768
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,635
Eh, we'd like
a bottle of wine.

769
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:27,342
<i>Eh, Chateau Fontegnac.</i>

770
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:31,845
Alas, monsieur,
I am desolated.

771
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,617
<i>Some person...</i>

772
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,420
<i>has committed an atrocity...</i>

773
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,018
against
the very last bottle.

774
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:44,032
<i>I think if you take a careful look in
the cellar, you'll find another one.</i>

775
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,467
<i>Certainement, monsieur.</i>

776
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,096
If you promise not
to piss in it.

777
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:57,207
- He's French.
- They shouldn't let him out of the cellar.

778
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,213
Yeah.

779
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:03,217
So, um, your sister...

780
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,583
my brother.

781
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:09,715
Think we'll be dancing at
their 50th wedding anniversary?

782
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,056
I have no idea.

783
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:16,588
She might just marry him twice and then
move on to the next lucky contestant.

784
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:20,692
You know,
Art is a little worried.

785
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,672
He thinks they might
be rushing things and...

786
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:28,506
<i>It's too late now. The
Titanic has already sailed.</i>

787
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:32,673
Maybe you can talk to Betty
about it, be the voice of reason.

788
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,842
The only voice Betty listens
to is the call of the wild.

789
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,716
Yes.

790
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:06,174
Perfect.

791
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,840
Hmm.

792
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,657
<i>- Thank you.
- Je vous en prie.</i>

793
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,098
Psst!

794
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,302
Shall I distract the lady
now while you slip...

795
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,777
a little something
into her wine?

796
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,408
<i>What a character, huh?</i>

797
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,418
You really crack me up.

798
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,547
<i>Oh, dites donc.</i>

799
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,293
To you.

800
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:59,133
- I hope we can be friends.
- We'll have to be.

801
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,329
We'll be related, almost
like brother and sister.

802
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,304
Right.

803
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,739
You don't like the idea?

804
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,972
Yeah, yeah.
It's just that, uh...

805
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:14,277
this makes what I'm thinking
about taboo in most civilizations.

806
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,596
Would you like
to come in?

807
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,135
Maybe I should
go home.

808
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,502
Nobody's waiting up
for you, are they?

809
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:45,273
So to top it all off...

810
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,544
he shoots his underpants
over the shower door to me.

811
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,676
No, I don't believe it.

812
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:53,517
Poor guy.
What a way to start a day.

813
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,523
How about me?

814
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,321
Well, you were
taking a shower.

815
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,158
I mean, he was the one
humping the glass door.

816
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,664
He must have been
terribly humiliated.

817
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:06,064
Right. I was
just violated.

818
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:09,161
Not you.
You are too tough.

819
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,040
Tough?

820
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,702
Too tough?

821
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:19,200
No, no, no.

822
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,675
No, Betty.

823
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,474
No, Betty, no, no.

824
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,480
No, no.

825
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,415
No, no!

826
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:37,357
You were dreaming about my sister.

827
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:41,021
Yeah. Yeah.

828
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:44,429
When we were growing up, every
boyfriend I had had a crush on her.

829
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,196
Did that sound like
a good dream?

830
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,102
- Hmm?
- No, I guess not.

831
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:55,370
Ohh!
I was at the wedding.

832
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,904
It was a nightmare.
I was the...

833
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:04,214
The best man...

834
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:07,414
and I couldn't move.

835
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,391
And then...
there you were...

836
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,394
Beautiful and perfect.

837
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,659
Let's just forget
about Betty and Art.

838
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,997
Yeah.
Let's forget 'em.

839
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,594
Yeah.

840
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,034
Where are you going?

841
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:34,173
To splash some cold water
on my face.

842
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,255
Hmm.

843
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:21,663
Hmm. Ohh, God.

844
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,563
I have this
incredible headache.

845
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:30,127
- Me too.
- You do?

846
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,072
I think I need
an aspirin. Yeah.

847
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,713
- Oh.
- Good morning.

848
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,715
Good morning.

849
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:47,887
Aspirin. Aspirin.
Yeah.

850
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,510
<i>Bart?</i>

851
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,081
I'll be right out.

852
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:34,301
Oh, I feel like
my head's gonna pop...

853
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,532
<i>like I've been in a coma
or something.</i>

854
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,540
Will you rub my neck
for a minute?

855
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,508
<i>- Neck? Yeah, yeah.
- Please?</i>

856
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,511
Thanks.

857
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,079
Did I drink a lot
last night?

858
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,085
Well...

859
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:56,858
- Right.
- What's wrong?

860
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:01,555
Forgot the aspirin. We both
had too much last night.

861
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,791
<i>Ooh!</i>

862
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,145
Ohh!

863
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:26,384
<i>Hey, what took you
so long?</i>

864
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,185
- l-I-I-I hopped in the shower.
- I need one too.

865
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,193
- I'm late for work.
- Yeah, and...

866
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,173
<i>Art?</i>

867
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,253
<i>Art!</i>

868
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,521
Whew! Ohh.

869
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,966
- You're not dressed yet.
- No.

870
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,978
I think I'm going to
take a shower.

871
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,980
Another one?

872
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,380
Yeah, I forgot, uh,
my ankles.

873
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,994
Ooh! Aah! Ow!

874
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,940
<i>- You up?
- Didn't you hear me calling you?</i>

875
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:57,168
Soap in my ears.

876
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:00,112
Did I leave the water on?
Yeah.

877
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,343
<i>Ohh.</i>

878
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:34,378
Ohh!

879
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,688
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

880
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,724
I gotta go,
but you stay.

881
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:46,522
- I'll have Maria make you breakfast.
- Yeah. That's okay.

882
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:50,031
I'd better be off. I don't
want to run into Bart... Art!

883
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,992
- I'll call you later.
- Sure.

884
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,082
Bye.

885
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,281
Art?

886
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,217
- Art!
- What?

887
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,291
I'm leaving now.

888
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,293
I have a date.

889
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,421
You're on the 9:00 to Puerto Vallarta.

890
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,432
Um...

891
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,434
I-I'm just going to
fall back and...

892
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,132
regroup for a while
and...

893
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,233
make a plan.

894
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,301
Dumping one sister
at the altar...

895
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:13,313
and leaving the other
with a cheap one-night stand?

896
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:16,509
That's some fine plan.

897
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,519
You should
write that down.

898
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:22,614
You know...
1,000 ways to humiliate...

899
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:26,127
degrade, generally make
everyone miserable.

900
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:30,296
See ya.

901
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:45,008
<i>- All right.
- I'm gonna play these ones.</i>

902
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,516
- Give me...
- You want two fives still?

903
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,642
I'll take one.

904
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,984
<i>- What you got?
- I'll take one.</i>

905
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,559
<i>- I'll take two.
- You're taking two?</i>

906
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,561
<i>- Two I'm taking.
- All right.</i>

907
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,564
<i>- Give me one.
- I'll take one.</i>

908
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:07,534
- Hey, wait a minute. That's my card.
- What's the matter with you?

909
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,832
Hey, hey, hey.
I need your help.

910
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:13,500
- I saw you pull an ace out of your shoe.
- I didn't do it!

911
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:17,238
- I'm in a jam. You gotta help me.
- I can't. I'm in a hole.

912
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:21,146
This is serious. You gotta go
out, start the car and wait for me.

913
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:25,312
- Let me finish this hand.
- There is no time. Someone is after me.

914
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:28,515
- Cool! Way better than poker.
- Better than poker!

915
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,821
Where's my hat?

916
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,191
<i>I'm coming, I'm coming!</i>

917
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:37,493
- Come on, boys! I don't wanna be late!
- Okay! Go, go!

918
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,693
- The car is right here.
- Move, move!

919
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,827
- All right.
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

920
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:45,100
<i>- I'm bad at driving.
- Who's driving? Who's driving?</i>

921
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,868
Just get in.

922
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:50,537
<i>Okay, let's go, let's go.</i>

923
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,709
All right,
get back in there.

924
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:57,843
<i>You remember how, don't ya?
- Of course I do.</i>

925
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,911
Idiot son of mine. Who else
would own a stick shift?

926
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:04,789
It's like making love to a woman...
put it in slowly and then floor it.

927
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,454
<i>What do you know?
You haven't even got a license!</i>

928
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,692
<i>- It's only because I can't see.
- What are you doing? It's not even raining!</i>

929
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:13,165
I don't know.
Wait a minute. Something...

930
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,905
<i>I don't understand!</i>

931
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:20,567
<i>All right!</i>

932
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,476
Move! Move! Let's go!

933
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,451
Come on!

934
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,316
- There!
- Hey! Now you're talking!

935
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,556
Take it slowly!

936
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:47,131
- Go back to
the home, you old farts!

937
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,432
Go, go, go, go, go!

938
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,771
<i>Positively Homeric!</i>

939
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:01,111
<i>- I can't, I'm telling you!
- I'm telling you! I'm telling you!</i>

940
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:03,707
<i>: El embrague!: El
El embrague!</i>

941
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:06,151
<i>Eso, eso! Alli, arriba!</i>

942
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:11,154
Taxi!

943
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:28,999
- Hey! They're coming!
Let's go! Let's go!

944
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:31,011
No! Hey!

945
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,301
I can't concentrate
on these pedals!

946
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,305
I'll steer!
Just step on it!

947
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,334
Come on!

948
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:05,140
It's all right!
Look out!

949
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:12,548
Keep going! Keep going!
Keep going! Stomp on it!

950
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:23,757
There's a valley in Spain
called Jarama

951
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,529
It's a place that
we all know so well

952
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:31,561
It was there that we gave
of our manhood

953
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:35,006
Where so many of
our brave comrades fell

954
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,442
<i>Viva la República!</i>

955
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,777
<i>Go, go! We can make it!</i>

956
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:43,750
Aaah! Stop!
We're gonna die!

957
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:47,447
Relax! lt'll be fine! I've
seen it done a thousand times!

958
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,717
Not in real life!

959
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:03,068
Yes! Yes! We done it!

960
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:38,269
- All right, all right.
- Let him out.

961
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:41,274
- I think I can do it.
- One leg at a time.

962
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,776
- My behind is broken.
- I got it, I got it.

963
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:48,305
- I'll never dance again. I know it.
- Okay, you guys go ahead.

964
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,317
I'll get the car back
tomorrow, all right?

965
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,945
And hey, hey...
Thanks.

966
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:57,515
Son, don't let that asshole brother
of yours get you into any more trouble.

967
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:00,083
Next time you have a problem,
call me.

968
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,129
- These guys are useless.
- I will.

969
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:06,327
<i>- Avanti.
- We are proud of the Lincoln Battalion</i>

970
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:10,531
And the fight for Madrid
that we made

971
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:14,564
There we fought like true sons
of the people

972
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:18,544
As part of
the 15th Brigade

973
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:41,660
- Art.
- I know you hate me, but can I come in?

974
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,670
I'm not alone.

975
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:48,241
- Manny.
- Hi, Art.

976
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,938
I-I took your advice
about the charm.

977
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:55,710
- So maybe I got a little carried away.
- I'll say.

978
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:59,378
- Well, uh...
- Is, uh, something the matter?

979
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:03,390
Um, I was just looking for a quiet place
to spend the night, but, uh...

980
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:08,150
<i>- It wouldn't be here, would it?
- Wait a second.</i>

981
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,754
You and... Manny?

982
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:14,063
When I said his brush strokes
spoke volumes...

983
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:16,501
I had no idea.

984
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:19,665
- You know what else?
- No, please. Don't tell me.

985
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:23,210
Key to the studio.

986
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:26,213
<i>- You can spend the night there.
- Thanks, Manny.</i>

987
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,328
Who is it?

988
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,202
Hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait.

989
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,204
Wait, wait, wait...
Aah!

990
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:54,605
- Are you guys crazy or what, huh?
- I think we're "what."

991
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:15,195
Wait. Wait...

992
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,130
Aaah!

993
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,606
<i>- Uh... no.
- Not his face!</i>

994
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:34,681
We want the groom
to look pretty tomorrow.

995
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,444
<i>- He might not dance so good.
- Look...</i>

996
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:41,852
I am leaving. She's all yours.

997
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:46,622
Yeah, schmucks like you always
bail out at the last minute...

998
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:48,889
no matter who
takes the fall.

999
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:51,363
Luckily I'm here
to protect Betty.

1000
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:57,626
You started somethin',
and you're gonna finish it.

1001
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:00,640
You're gonna go there
and marry her tomorrow...

1002
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:04,337
and what's more,
you're gonna make her happy.

1003
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:08,508
Because, so help me,
if you ever make Betty cry...

1004
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,610
I'm gonna break one bone
for every tear.

1005
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:15,281
And you know
she cries a lot.

1006
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:26,122
I just gotta get rid of all
of this negative energy!

1007
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,168
<i>- Doctor's orders!
- Not his face, boss!</i>

1008
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:32,803
<i>- Who says?
- Uh, you did, boss.</i>

1009
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,899
- You did, boss.
- Y-you did.

1010
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,443
You always gotta listen
to the boss.

1011
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:10,210
Oh, my God.

1012
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,783
<i>Bart?</i>

1013
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:23,152
Oh, my...

1014
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:25,215
Are you all right?

1015
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,227
<i>- Ohh!
- I've been better.</i>

1016
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,355
Ohh.
Here, let me help you.

1017
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:33,093
Oh, I'm sorry.

1018
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:36,603
- It's all right.
- Is something broken?

1019
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:39,640
- A rib, maybe.
- Owwie.

1020
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:42,867
It's okay.
It's okay.

1021
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:44,878
We should call somebody.

1022
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:50,116
What?

1023
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,118
You're so...

1024
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:55,722
Iovely.

1025
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,793
- Please be quiet.
- No, no. I mean it.

1026
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:01,795
When you are like this...

1027
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:05,398
Frowning...

1028
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:08,668
It is fantastic.

1029
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:17,069
Um, I am very happy
you came.

1030
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:31,324
I think
you're getting better.

1031
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:35,328
Ooh.

1032
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,330
Tell me what happened.

1033
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:39,628
What happened?

1034
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,861
I love you, Liz.

1035
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,905
That's what happened.

1036
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:51,336
From the moment
I laid eyes on you...

1037
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:56,281
when I stepped
in the shower...

1038
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:58,284
and there you were...

1039
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:01,287
glaring at me
through the water.

1040
01:31:01,355 --> 01:31:03,653
- That was Art.
- Yeah.

1041
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:06,352
I am Art.

1042
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:10,090
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's not a joke. It's not a joke.

1043
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:18,204
- All right, what does Betty keep on her night table?
- Uh...

1044
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:22,299
Five bottles of pills
and...

1045
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:24,435
three boxes of Kleenex
and...

1046
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:27,680
a beautiful picture
of you.

1047
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:30,478
- I can't believe this.
- Sure you can.

1048
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:32,542
Sure you can.

1049
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:35,054
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, I can.

1050
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,751
I believe you can betray Bart like this,
betray my sister, betray me...

1051
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:42,557
No, the person I've betrayed the most...
is myself.

1052
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,564
Why?
Because you stopped?

1053
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,430
Because you could've
gotten away with it?

1054
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:50,437
- Yeah, you really blew it.
- I want you to be with me.

1055
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,531
Not with someone else.

1056
01:31:57,311 --> 01:32:00,041
You know...

1057
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:02,048
I've always loved you.

1058
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,090
- Don't.
- Please.

1059
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,794
- Don't do this.
- Please, please. Please.

1060
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:08,348
You know what
I'm thinking about?

1061
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,350
Your mother.

1062
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,353
I'm sure she'd give you
a good whipping.

1063
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,355
You sure as hell
deserve one.

1064
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,357
Yeah.

1065
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,292
I remember when
you and Bart were born.

1066
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,295
She cried
for a whole month.

1067
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:03,202
<i>You sure someone who lives in
this house wants to marry you?</i>

1068
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:06,034
<i>Not me, Dad.
Art. Art!</i>

1069
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:10,976
What amazes me is that Art doesn't want
to marry someone who lives in this house.

1070
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:12,979
What made you
change your mind?

1071
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:15,607
I don't know whether
to laugh or cry.

1072
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:17,617
- Congratulations.
- No, Manny.

1073
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:20,279
I am not the one
who's getting married.

1074
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,845
It's my brother Art.
You follow?

1075
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:26,392
- Yeah, sure.
- Bart.

1076
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,725
My name is Bart.
Bart.

1077
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:35,865
We could speak
to the preacher.

1078
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:38,871
I'm sure he'd marry us
on the spot.

1079
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:41,874
I'd love to, but you're just
too young and foolish for me.

1080
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:50,516
Bart.

1081
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:52,518
Hi.

1082
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:57,185
- Hi.
- Um...

1083
01:34:57,258 --> 01:34:59,192
- What?
- I have to tell you something.

1084
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,524
But I don't want you to get angry.
Promise me.

1085
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:06,658
- I could never be angry with you.
- Not with me, with your brother.

1086
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:11,398
- What?
- He told me that he loved me last night.

1087
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:14,373
- Well...
- You promised.

1088
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:17,104
We can't let him
marry Betty.

1089
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,780
Great.

1090
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:25,216
What you do now is tell Betty
what you just told me.

1091
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,454
Right.
You're right.

1092
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:30,319
Yeah.

1093
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:33,383
It's just that
it's so hurtful.

1094
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:35,952
A-And you...
I'm really sorry.

1095
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:37,964
I know, I know, I know.

1096
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:43,002
Liz.

1097
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:46,963
Do you feel anything
for Art?

1098
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:51,810
No.

1099
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:54,814
How did things
get so screwed up?

1100
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:26,979
I gotta get these
checked.

1101
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:32,951
I saw Art last night...

1102
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:37,650
<i>and he said some things
that made it clear...</i>

1103
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:42,059
that he's not ready for the kind
of commitment that you deserve.

1104
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:46,295
Well, I think he is.

1105
01:36:47,735 --> 01:36:51,831
He said he's had feelings for
me since the day he met me.

1106
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:56,002
No offense, Lizzie, but your record
with men is really not all that great.

1107
01:36:56,076 --> 01:37:00,172
<i>You've never known how to read them
and you still don't.</i>

1108
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:03,478
He said... he loved me.

1109
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:05,883
Well, I'm sure
that he does.

1110
01:37:05,953 --> 01:37:07,887
He kissed me.

1111
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,890
There.
I kissed you too.

1112
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,893
But that doesn't mean
that I'm in love with you.

1113
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,334
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1114
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:27,997
- Art?
- Yes, Manny, yes.

1115
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:33,069
I'm glad you could make it. One more
Dodge and we can have a used car lot.

1116
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:35,274
<i>You knew Ernest Hemingway
personally?</i>

1117
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:38,045
<i>- Hi.
- Yes. We played golf together.</i>

1118
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,609
<i>- Uh, see you later, huh?
- Hemingway never hit the front lines...</i>

1119
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,919
until the only people aiming at him
were the photographers.

1120
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:49,962
<i>I mean no.</i>

1121
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,965
So, my dear, just relax
and follow your instincts.

1122
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:56,969
Fly in the sky, free like a bird.

1123
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,306
What have you done?

1124
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,866
Don't you know that it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding?

1125
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:06,378
Um... I'm sorry.

1126
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:09,883
We're not gonna have
bad luck, are we?

1127
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:12,441
Hmm?

1128
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:16,011
'Cause I just want
everybody to be happy.

1129
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:27,399
So, you must be
the famous Art.

1130
01:38:27,468 --> 01:38:29,402
Dr. Huffeyer,
I presume.

1131
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:31,404
Huffeyer. A pleasure.
Yes. Right.

1132
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:34,407
Betty talks about you
all the time.

1133
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:37,410
I have to admit I'm even
just a little bit jealous.

1134
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:42,541
What you have achieved in a very short time
I haven't come close to in years of treatment.

1135
01:38:42,616 --> 01:38:45,551
What a beautiful ring.
Where did you find it?

1136
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:48,554
You're not going to believe this,
but it fell from heaven.

1137
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:52,490
Ah. Does it say "Love you, Huffy"
on the inside?

1138
01:38:52,559 --> 01:38:54,493
It's... It's...
It's my ring.

1139
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:56,495
- I need it.
- Sorry... Sorry, Doctor.

1140
01:38:56,563 --> 01:38:58,497
See you later, eh?

1141
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:02,768
Are you really going to
go through with this?

1142
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:04,770
Any reason I shouldn't?

1143
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:10,505
- Bart's looking for you everywhere.
- Is he?

1144
01:39:10,577 --> 01:39:13,512
- He wants to talk to you.
- He told you that?

1145
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:16,481
Yes. Now stay here.
It's incredibly important.

1146
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,417
- He told you that too?
- Yes.

1147
01:39:19,486 --> 01:39:23,650
I'm gonna go get him. You
just wait here. Don't move.

1148
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:28,060
Did you tell Betty
about last night?

1149
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,188
You... Ohh.

1150
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,847
Ohh!

1151
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,032
<i>Grow up!</i>

1152
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,105
- Hello?
- Maria.

1153
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:24,173
- Um, get me Dr. Huffeyer.
- I'll check the garden, miss. Hold on one second.

1154
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,881
Bart. Bart, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1155
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:34,018
Betty won't listen to me.
You have to convince Art to call it off.

1156
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:37,222
- Right.
- No, no, this way. This way.

1157
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:39,356
Bye.

1158
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:44,359
So what is the big deal?
What do you want me to do?

1159
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:48,101
- Hold up the ceremony?
- I won't let him make my sister unhappy.

1160
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:50,109
Is that
the only reason?

1161
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:54,210
Okay.

1162
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:56,715
I-I'm gonna look for him
right now.

1163
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:59,218
He's waiting for you.

1164
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:01,550
Here?

1165
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:06,058
Mmm. Mmm.

1166
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:11,364
Art?

1167
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,667
Art.

1168
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,770
Look, man.

1169
01:41:21,108 --> 01:41:25,101
You can't do this to Betty.
You've got to call it off.

1170
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,371
You amaze me.

1171
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:32,783
You just show up after four years,
and right away you launch into sermons?

1172
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:34,878
<i>- Geez, Bart!
- Art?</i>

1173
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:37,389
<i>- Sermon, my ass.
- Bart?</i>

1174
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:40,393
You are about to make the all-time
biggest possible mistake, and you know it.

1175
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:44,227
And look at me when I am talking to you! You
are going to make Betty totally miserable.

1176
01:41:44,298 --> 01:41:47,290
<i>Everything is
so damned simple for you.</i>

1177
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:51,326
Look, in two days,
you've got everything...

1178
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:53,771
everything
I've always wanted.

1179
01:41:53,841 --> 01:41:58,210
<i>Your problem is, you've never
known what you've wanted.</i>

1180
01:41:58,278 --> 01:41:59,643
Hello!

1181
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:08,548
Maybe I don't know
what I want...

1182
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:11,716
but at least I don't run away
every time there is a problem!

1183
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:24,295
Did he think
he could pull this off?

1184
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:28,774
Does your brother think I'm
brain-dead? Shut up! Don't answer that!

1185
01:42:28,842 --> 01:42:32,243
I could change my mind
and croak you right here!

1186
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:36,305
Gene. Listen good.
I mean, Bart is right.

1187
01:42:36,383 --> 01:42:40,547
<i>You are the one who is in love with
Betty, and you're telling me to marry her?</i>

1188
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:45,957
- It doesn't make any sense.
- When was the last time things made any sense?

1189
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:50,019
What you want, what I want,
isn't worth squat.

1190
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:53,965
The only thing that matters here
is what Betty wants...

1191
01:42:54,034 --> 01:42:57,197
And what she wants is you.

1192
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:00,707
And so help me God, she's going
to get you, probably not for long.

1193
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:04,403
See, guys like you, you come and go.
You're just a temp!

1194
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,114
But I'm forever...

1195
01:43:10,551 --> 01:43:14,612
because I...
I really love her.

1196
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,755
So now, pal...

1197
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:24,058
You and I got a date
with fate...

1198
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:26,895
- All right.
- At the altar.

1199
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:32,935
Are you ready, dear?

1200
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:36,965
<i>"Wedding March"]
- [Guests Murmuring]</i>

1201
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,308
<i>She looks gorgeous.</i>

1202
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:42,610
Cheer up, dear boy.
It's a wedding, not an execution.

1203
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:28,826
<i>Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here...</i>

1204
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:31,955
before our Lord God
and this company...

1205
01:44:32,032 --> 01:44:35,798
<i>to unite this man
and this woman...</i>

1206
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:38,702
<i>in the bonds
ofholy matrimony...</i>

1207
01:44:38,772 --> 01:44:41,764
to join this couple
together...

1208
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:44,606
until... death.

1209
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:48,079
<i>Seeing some of those present...</i>

1210
01:44:48,148 --> 01:44:51,447
Lord, you must
be thinking...

1211
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:56,319
"I've seen these faces
somewhere before."

1212
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:02,956
Let us remember...

1213
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:05,931
the solemnity
of this ceremony.

1214
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,958
<i>Listen to my questions...</i>

1215
01:45:10,037 --> 01:45:13,939
<i>and give thought
to all of your answers.</i>

1216
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:16,669
<i>If anyone knows any reason...</i>

1217
01:45:16,743 --> 01:45:20,577
<i>these two people should not
bejoined in marriage...</i>

1218
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:24,777
speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

1219
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:37,290
I do.

1220
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:43,864
No, dear. Remember?

1221
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:46,633
<i>- That comes later.
- No.</i>

1222
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,214
You pig!

1223
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:58,547
You worthless, selfish
son of a bitch!

1224
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:01,883
- You only think of yourself!
All the time!

1225
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:05,220
<i>You may be rich,
but you're a creep, and I love you!</i>

1226
01:46:06,326 --> 01:46:09,625
I do love you.

1227
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:55,502
No, Hopper. Not now.

1228
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:59,411
You son of a bitch.

1229
01:47:27,507 --> 01:47:30,442
What would Freud
have made of this?

1230
01:47:54,267 --> 01:47:56,827
I couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

1231
01:47:56,903 --> 01:48:00,270
<i>Uh, I've gotta
go back to Italy.</i>

1232
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:04,436
Responsibilities.

1233
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,807
I have kids.

1234
01:48:08,882 --> 01:48:11,407
<i>Three boys.</i>

1235
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,544
Three?

1236
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:15,952
Yeah.

1237
01:48:16,022 --> 01:48:18,513
Three little bambinos.

1238
01:48:19,459 --> 01:48:22,428
Luigi and Paolo
and, and...

1239
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:24,964
<i>- Gi...
- Giuseppe?</i>

1240
01:48:25,031 --> 01:48:27,932
<i>- Giulio.
- Giulio.</i>

1241
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:30,299
Is there a wife?

1242
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:34,238
<i>Hate the woman.
I haven't spoken to her for years.</i>

1243
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:37,572
The boys live with their grandma.

1244
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:42,846
But yesterday the old lady
fell down the stairs and...

1245
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,510
Dead?

1246
01:48:45,585 --> 01:48:49,214
Paralyzed...
from the neck down.

1247
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:55,951
Well...

1248
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:57,963
good-bye.

1249
01:48:59,165 --> 01:49:01,292
I'm sorry.

1250
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:03,563
Give my love to Art.

1251
01:49:06,406 --> 01:49:09,398
He's not good enough
for you.

1252
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:14,511
Neither am I.

1253
01:49:20,453 --> 01:49:23,718
Good-bye, Liz.

1254
01:49:25,692 --> 01:49:27,785
Good-bye...

1255
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:34,499
Art.

1256
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:46,578
All right, now!

1257
01:49:46,646 --> 01:49:49,479
Yea!

1258
01:50:17,577 --> 01:50:20,171
You really should...

1259
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,016
See you around.

1260
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:28,543
- Okay. See you, see you. How are you doing?
- Fine.

1261
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:31,386
<i>I love the show. Bye.</i>

1262
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:36,521
Well, uh...

1263
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:39,224
congratulations.

1264
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:42,427
The gallery's gonna do much better
with you running it.

1265
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:47,269
- Well, I think I have a better eye for talent.
- You're referring to me?

1266
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:51,367
But there's one client I think you
should handle personally.

1267
01:50:55,115 --> 01:50:58,448
There is only
one true work of art...

1268
01:50:58,518 --> 01:51:02,249
in this whole room...
you.

1269
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:17,632
See you later, kids.

1270
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:24,702
Hello.

1271
01:51:26,112 --> 01:51:28,046
Hello.

1272
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:34,410
I've been told this painting's
not for sale.

1273
01:51:34,487 --> 01:51:37,650
It already has an owner.

1274
01:51:37,724 --> 01:51:41,057
I don't think she,
she cares about it anymore.

1275
01:51:41,127 --> 01:51:43,459
I knew the artist.

1276
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:46,897
I doubt it.

1277
01:51:46,966 --> 01:51:50,129
You and him don't move
in the same circles.

1278
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:53,536
Maybe I'm talking
to the wrong person.

1279
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:02,273
I'm sorry.

1280
01:52:02,348 --> 01:52:04,748
Oh, God.

1281
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:08,447
The first time I set eyes on
you, everything else faded away.

1282
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:12,753
I mean, from that moment on,
for me there was only you.

1283
01:52:12,826 --> 01:52:15,090
Only me?

1284
01:52:15,161 --> 01:52:18,096
<i>You mean my sister first
and then me.</i>

1285
01:52:18,164 --> 01:52:21,759
- You had a pretty good deal there, admit it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1286
01:52:21,835 --> 01:52:24,963
Do you honestly think I was having fun?
I mean, think about it.

1287
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:28,064
- Why did you lie to me?
- Because you never gave me a chance.

1288
01:52:28,141 --> 01:52:32,635
Because I couldn't stand being rejected
and then seeing you fall in love with Bart.

1289
01:52:32,712 --> 01:52:35,977
<i>- You are Bart!
- No, Bart doesn't exist!</i>

1290
01:52:36,049 --> 01:52:38,381
All right.
You miss Bart?

1291
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:41,386
I'll stop being Art,
and I'll be Bart.

1292
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:44,150
You really are a brick short,
aren't you?

1293
01:52:44,224 --> 01:52:47,387
From the moment I met you.

1294
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:51,892
Art already told me that.
Or was that Bart?

1295
01:52:51,965 --> 01:52:55,059
Just tell me,
who do you want me to be?

1296
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:27,365
So was that
Art or Bart?

1297
01:53:28,935 --> 01:53:31,369
Just me.
