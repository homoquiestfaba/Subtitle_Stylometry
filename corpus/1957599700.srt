Oh, my God, but I told Felix you were coming.

45
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,433
What happened? I sent you the transcript.

46
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,466
Yes, and I read it.

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,800

00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,066
Well, I'm sorry if you misunderstood.

00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,233

61
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:17,100
serving a 10 year prison term for the abduction of her own infant son.

00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,633

Please?

78
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,633
So, can I call you Tom?

79
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,300
Sure.

80
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,366
Good. Then you can stop calling me Mrs. Crispini.

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,533
Anyway, I'm really a Finn.

82
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:14,433
Which is not the same thing as a Swede

83
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:17,700
because you may hear some people calling me "The Swede."

84
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,800
Not that I've ever been to Finland.

85
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,766
God, I can't believe I'm actually sitting next to you.

86

I mean, to me, seeing you on TV fighting like that,

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,466
well, I guess I should just say it.

88
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,733

91
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,200
Tell me, why are you interested in this case?

92
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,033
Oh, in a few words?

93
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:44,566
No, we'd have to sit down, it's very complicated.

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,133
Don't you ever light them?

95
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,266
Oh, I'm busting my nuts trying to quit,

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,100
so, I just kind of go through the motions.

97
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,533
Everything in the world is suggestion, you know.

98
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:57,233
Everything is just one step away from a dream.

99
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,433
It sure feels like it sometimes.

100
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,966
Yeah. Like, I had this doctor once, telling me that I had a cancer.

101
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,600
But I don't.

102
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,066
How do you know?

103
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,400
Because from the day I made up my mind, the pains just stopped.

104
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,833
No kidding!

105
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,900
Of course, I completely gave up alcohol and sex.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Why, you don't think that's possible?

107
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:24,866
Listen, the way you look, I'd have to doubt it.

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,533
But I know it's possible.

109
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,233
Can I ask you what you mean by that?

110
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,266
What I said.

111
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,733
But why sex?

112
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:36,766
Oh, I don't know. It's usual, I guess.

113
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,366
Sooner or later Mother Nature can slow you down.

114
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
Really? At your age?

115
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,766
Huh, so how do you feel without it?

116
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,700
I mean, I feel absolutely purified.

117
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,266
I've never felt this clean.

118
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,366
Well, that's good.

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,733
I sort of have mixed feelings about it myself.

120
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,800
Thank you.

121
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,400
It's so important you came.

122
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,933
His appeal comes up on Thursday.

123
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,066
We're claiming his lawyer was incompetent.

124
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,433
That's not very good grounds.

125
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,566
I know, Tom.

126
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,033
Let me show you what he looked like when they arrested him.

127
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,566
You're not going to believe this.

128
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,233
Did you know Felix before the murder?

129
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,866
Oh, no, I never knew him till the trial.

130
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
But Victor had been my doctor.

131
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,066
Victor? Oh, the man who was killed.

132
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,866
Dr. Victor Daniels. Didn't I mention that?

133
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,433
He was a very wonderful friend to me.

134
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,533
I see.

135
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,300
I was so upset, you know, I couldn't sleep.

136
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,966
I mean, to listen to that Haggerty going on day after day

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,366
and without any evidence!

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,700
I might as well tell you.

139
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,766
Charlie Haggerty is one reason I even returned your call.

140
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,300
You know that joker tried to get my license revoked?

141
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,433
Damn near put me out of business.

142
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:06,566
Really?

143
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,633
Oh, uh, here's a picture of Felix before the trial.

144
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:20,333
Hello, dear, it's Angela. Do you remember?

145
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,366
You came back.

146
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,733
Oh, Felix, I'll always come back.

147
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,366
I brought Mr. O'Toole.

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,566
This is Mr. O'Toole, Tom O'Toole.

149
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,933
Felix. This is Felix.

150
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,400
Sit down.

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,700
TOM: I'm trying to get a feel for this case, Felix.

152
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,066
Maybe I can come up with some angle for Mrs. Crispini to run down.

153
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,433
You don't look like you're eating, Felix.

154
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,800
It's all grease.

155
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,533
But you've got to eat.

156
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,366
You live in Boston.

157
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,700
How'd you come to be down in Highbury the night your uncle was killed?

158
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,366
I had a date. A date?

159
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,566
With your uncle?

160
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,866
Can I tell him?

161
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,166
He has a friend, Cindy, in Highbury.

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,100
They had a date and she didn't show.

163
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,400
FELIX: I was going to be down there anyway.

164
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:07,533
My mom was always on me to go see Uncle Victor.

165
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,600
She thought he could help get me into pharmacy school.

166
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,266
Pharmacy school?

167
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,633
Yeah, he was a doctor. He knew everybody on the boards.

168
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,233
What was the first notification you had of your uncle being murdered?

169
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,033
Um, I read it in the paper.

170
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,466
And what happened next?

171
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:26,133
These two Boston detectives come around,

172
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,233
and they go, "Can we look at your comb, sir?"

173
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,933
I give it to them. And the next day, I'm under arrest.

174
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:39,633
There's no mention of your friend Cindy in the transcript.

175
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:43,033
FELIX: That's because my lawyer couldn't be bothered to call her in.

176
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,933
I mean, they would have a break for lunch,

177
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,566
and he would go outside and read a book!

178

191

DEFENSE LAWYER: It comes down, Your Honor, to the perfectly obvious fact

201
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:17,133
that the defendant, Felix Daniels, did not have competent counsel.

202
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:21,066
He failed to bring up important evidence which I have presented here today.

203
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,300
For this, and other reasons, we appeal to the court for a new trial.

Mr. Haggerty.

205
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:33,200
Your Honor, defendant's counsel was very successful in numerous other cases.

He's a well-known attorney with a reputable law firm.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,133
Felix Daniels was convicted of a bloody and brutal murder.

208
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,133
There's not the slightest doubt about his guilt.

209
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,133
The evidence is damning and complete.

210
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,000
This appeal has absolutely no basis in fact.

00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:06,133
All right.

533
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,600
Now I'm not on a vendetta.

534
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,566
I was a Boston cop for a lot of years.

535
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,333
Till they threw him out, I heard.

536
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,600
I made up my mind at breakfast

537
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,033
that I'm not going to get mad all day.

538
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,133
Oh, give us a break, O'Toole.

539
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,966
Who gives a shit if you get mad?

540
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
You never know, Chief.

541
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:21,433
I mean, Charlie, you can't seriously be asking us

542
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:22,866
to listen to this crap!

543
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,366
I know the woman he's been talking to.

544
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,900
There's no question in my mind that Felix Daniels is innocent.

545
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,366
I want him out of jail.

546
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,733
BELLANCA: You finished?

547
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,400
Bellanca, you got the wrong man.

548
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,766
Now the smart thing would be to face it now.

549
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,533
The woman who has been feeding him this garbage

550
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:37,266
has been a hooker for years!

551
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,466
The Highbury Inn, Looie's 48 Club, Ritchy's Truck Stop.

552
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,366
You name it and she has hooked there!

553
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,500
And he is taking her word over ours!

554
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,200
Felix Daniels killed his uncle, Dr. Victor Daniels.

555
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,266
Period.

556
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,966
Okay. This department will not obstruct

557
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,866
any legitimate investigation into the Daniels case.

558
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,066
I want to look at the evidence.

559
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
If we've got it, you can see it.

560
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:12,566
O'Toole, you will never get Daniels out, A.

561
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,966
B, you are making the biggest mistake of your life.

562
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,433
See you around.

563
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,300
Try one? Not my game.

564
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,033
Judge, when you can find a minute

565
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:32,866
I've got the transcript of the Daniels case.

566
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,066
Pull!

567
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,733
That woman I saw you with,

568
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:41,400
is she the wife or something?

569
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,566
No, she's...

570
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,766
(LAUGHS)

571
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
Tell you the God's honest truth

572
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,433
I'm still not sure what her connection is.

573
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,466
But the case stinks, Judge, it really does.

574
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,433
Charlie Haggerty's turning into a public menace.

575
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:52,900
No, no. Pull!

576
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,200
He's just a second rate mind in a position of power.

577

The commonest story since the world began.

578
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,433
Are you sexually involved with that woman?

579
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,566
No need to elaborate. (CHUCKLES)

580
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,800
Pull.

581
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,633
I'll be right with you.

582
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,566
Hey, I know a wonderful pasta joint. Do you like ziti?

583
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,366
Couple of things we've got to discuss, Angela,

584
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,066
before we go out. Really have to.

585
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,233
God, you're a great looking man.

586
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:30,933
Have you ever read this?

587
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:32,733
It's Joan Crawford's biography by her daughter.

588
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:34,700
I'm not too big on trash.

589
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:36,966
Well, some trash is interesting.

590
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,933
But I think that's uncalled for.

591
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,666
I mean, it's her own daughter.

592
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:46,000
My father raped me but I'm not writing books about him.

593
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:49,866
He really raped you?

594
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,133
Oh, for years.

595
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:53,300
By the same token, though, with people like him

596
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,366
it wasn't, you know, all that unusual with a daughter.

597
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,966
But it sure did me in.

598
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:02,033
Listen, Angela, this is really important.

599
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:03,200
We've got to get into some details...

600
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:04,633
Oh, but it's not important that a woman was raped?

601
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,300
Now listen, Angela, it's out in the open that I'm on this case.

602
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,033
I have to know what your involvement is.

603
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:12,100
I told you. Victor Daniels was my doctor.

604
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:15,400
And Felix? You really never knew Felix before the trial?

605
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:16,900
I don't understand.

606
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:19,633
You mean, I can't be upset about an innocent man being put away?

607
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,966
Oh, sure you can, but listen,

608
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,933
I'm pulling out all the stops here.

609
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:25,533
The least you could do is level with me!

610
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:27,066
Oh, come on, will you?

611
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,433
Why don't you just come out with it!

612
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,733
What you really mean is where does a fucking whore come off

613
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:32,366
trying to pass herself off... Wait! I didn't call you that!

614

Oh, go on, say it. You're so full of shit!

Do you?

627
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:58,033
Well, if you can't get it up then just get going.

About crocheting.

No kidding! You do crocheting?

Maybe I'd take it up 'cause people would buy them.

00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,100

712
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:06,533
No, funny you ask that though.

713
00:45:06,566 --> 00:45:08,400
I've got a brother that's in the Church.

714
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:12,133
Yeah. I can always tell one.

715
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,900
Could you believe I was in once for nearly a year.

716
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:18,800
But I kept trying to get over the wall trying to find girls.

717
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,966
Jerry, I got... I'm talking to this man.

718
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:29,066
Major give me this.

719
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,966
People don't believe it, but he did.

720
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:34,966
You read that?

721
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,833
(TOM READING) "Grand Army of the Republic."

722
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:45,400
Major gave you that?

723
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:47,900
That's his battle knife from the Civil War.

724
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,300
You believe me?

725
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:55,833
Why not?

726
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:08,300
Well, I've got myself pretty straightened out, see.

727
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,733
But I'm still kind of loaded up a lot of the time.

728
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:12,400
I'm reading you, Jerry.

729
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:14,533
Yeah, I know.

730
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:16,400
I knew the first time you looked at me.

731
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:19,900
Well, it's kind of hard, you know.

732
00:46:20,566 --> 00:46:21,900
Well...

733
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,366
That shows you're not an animal,

734
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,233
don't it, Jerry?

735
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:31,233
I mean, there's lots that wouldn't even be bothered.

736
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:32,700
I can't hardly breathe sometimes.

737
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:34,900
You know, he isn't in this all alone.

738
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,633
Who asked you?

739
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,133
There are other people involved.

740
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,866
You got anything inside? What you got in there!

What did I say?

00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,633
Jerry!

747
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:11,300
Jerry, here's my number.

748
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,066
Call me, day or night.

749
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,033
I guess I don't have to tell you,

750
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,600
there's no power in the world

751
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:20,700
that can break a man's grip on his own throat.

752
00:47:20,733 --> 00:47:22,866

00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:42,000
Are you feeling better?

756
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,966
Looks like you slept.

757
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:47,966
Yeah, I felt safe.

758
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,566
Look, I'm sorry.

759
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:57,133
I should have leveled with you

760
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,233
but I wasn't sure you'd understand.

Are you under psychiatric care?

764
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,000
I used to be.

765
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,600
But I haven't had any of this stuff happen

766
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,100
for about three years.

767
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:23,733
It doesn't mean I don't tell you the truth, you know.

768
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:25,366
Yeah.

769
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,466
It's just the way you suddenly came at me just before.

770
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:30,333
Then in Jerry's place...

771
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,966
Jerry's place? Yeah.

772
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,966
What did I say over at Jerry's place?

773
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,566
That I mustn't go tracking anybody without your say-so.

774

775

This Jerry who everybody says killed Victor Daniels.

(WHISPERING) Jerry...

777
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:54,233
That's because I never want you to be alone with him.

778
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:56,600
He gets crazy, you know.

779
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,066
I've just been with Jerry.

780
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:02,733
Talking to him.

781
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:08,766
Do you want to talk or do you want to sleep?

782
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:17,233
I have the feeling you want to tell me something.

783
00:49:18,766 --> 00:49:19,900
Am I wrong?

784
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,833
Tom? Yes.

785
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,133
I used to be with Victor.

786
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:35,300
Victor Daniels?

787
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,233
I thought he was such a pillar.

788
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:42,266
He saved me.

789
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,633
He was a real friend.

790
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,333
I will always owe Victor.

791
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:49,766
Must have been some shock then, huh?

Butchered.

793
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:53,033
And the killer right there

794
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:54,766
and they go and put Felix away.

795
00:49:58,466 --> 00:50:01,033
I want to talk to you for days.

796
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:04,200
I just have to feel that we're friends.

797
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:07,466
Well I've got to say, I've never known anybody so hard to get a fix on.

Oh, Tom, I need you.

Incidentally,

801
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,200
I'm not supposed to be saying this yet

802
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:56,233
but your friend, Charlie Haggerty,

803
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:58,633
looks like the Party's choice for the State Senate.

804
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:01,300
The State Senate! Harry, you're kidding me.

805
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:04,000
Well, he's no more a meathead than all those other meatheads.

806
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,633
Only, this time he's not going down that easy.

807
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:10,600
He'll fight for his life on this case.

808
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,866
I reversed him once and I'll do it again.

809
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,433
Frankly, Tom, I wonder if you ought to forget the whole thing.

810
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,333
TOM: You're not serious.

811
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,900
Well, this woman is your whole case

812
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:23,033
and you still don't know why she's even involved.

813
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:25,033
I'm still trying to dig it out of her, but I will.

814
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:26,366
I know I will.

815
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,233
Now listen to me, Tommy,

816
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:30,600
if she won't come clean you've got to take a walk.

817
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:33,133
This is basic, kid. I know it.

818
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:35,066
I get the feeling you're walking on bubbles!

819
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,266

Yes, a romantic fellow like you

823
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:44,866
always has to idealize the woman he's screwing.

824
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,800
You better stay out of her bed.

And?

828
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:54,466
She's got a right to be upset.

829
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,900
All they proved in court was that Felix was in the doctor's house.

830
00:51:57,933 --> 00:51:59,800
Nobody proved he killed anybody.

831
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,366
Then I am right! Haggerty did it again.

832
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
But you've got to nail that woman's story.

833

891
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:44,766
So I was thinking, maybe if you sat down with us...

892
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,566
Just us three,

893
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,833
we could all get together and, you know, talk.

894
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,233
Sure, I'd be happy to.

895
00:56:56,266 --> 00:56:57,733
I'll get on it right away.

896
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,566
TOM: Why won't you talk to him?

897
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,833
All he wants is for you to hold his hand.

898
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,866
What are you afraid of?

899
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,233
I'll be right there with you.

900
00:57:22,866 --> 00:57:24,566
Do you like me a little?

901
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,333
(LAUGHS) A little?

902
00:57:26,366 --> 00:57:27,800
What, are you kidding me?

903
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:29,766
I want to hear it.

904
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:37,266
You're the most unexpected thing that ever happened to me.

905
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,766
I'm with you, honey.

906
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,166
Tell me the story.

907
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:45,966
Just start anywhere.

908
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:48,033
Tell me.

909
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:55,900
Jerry was a runner.

910
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:57,100
Yeah?

911
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,200
He ran drugs for Victor.

912
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,200
Dr. Daniels was in drugs?

913
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,033
He was the main man.

914
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:11,233
Boy, oh, boy, I'm really out of it.

915
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:13,200
That never even crossed my mind.

916
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,133
But why did Jerry kill Daniels?

917
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,766
Victor owed him money.

918
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,633
Jerry had this idea that Victor would help him build a church

919
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:28,866
and when he wouldn't do it, Jerry went berserk.

920
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,066
Well, why didn't the cops arrest him?

921
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,033
Because he knows all the connections.

922
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:35,766
Connections to?

923
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,300
Drugs, the police, Bellanca...

924
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,100
Why don't they just waste him?

925
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:42,233
Maybe they will.

926
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:44,066
You mean if he keeps talking to me?

927
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:48,266
Well, it all suddenly seems to make sense.

928
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,333
I can see why you always seem so terrified.

929
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,133
TOM: You are, aren't you?

930
00:58:58,566 --> 00:58:59,566
Is this Bimini?

931
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:05,200
Amy says now and then you and she would donkey the stuff up from there.

932
00:59:07,366 --> 00:59:09,466
I stopped two years ago.

933
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,533
But the cops must know about that, too.

934
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:13,966
So how do you come to be beating on them now with this case?

935
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,966
Because I know how innocent Felix is and I can't bear it.

936
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:20,433
We'll go and meet Jerry.

937
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:22,233
We'll talk, we'll get this over with.

938
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:23,533
I have to tell you something, Tom.

939
00:59:23,566 --> 00:59:24,633
Tell me in the car.

940
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:26,833
No, I'm trying to tell you something.

941
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,733
I used to be with Charlie Haggerty.

942
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,800
You were in the hammock with the prosecutor?

943
00:59:38,766 --> 00:59:40,633
He nearly left his wife for me.

944
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,333
No kidding.

945
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:47,166
It was the best two years of my life

946
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,033
until they made him rig the case against Felix.

947
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:51,766
Why did they make him do it?

948
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,633
A man as important as Dr. Daniels chopped up like that...

949
00:59:57,666 --> 00:59:59,633
They had to nail it on somebody.

950
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:01,233
Jerry was absolutely out.

951
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:02,900
Jerry could bomb the whole police department

952
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,933
plus both parties in this town in the bargain.

953
01:00:05,966 --> 01:00:08,400
This case goes to the top of the mountain, Tom.

954
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:09,633
The top.

955
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,700
We'd go out to Charlie's place on the beach,

956
01:00:15,466 --> 01:00:17,200
we'd sit staring at the fire.

957
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:19,466
It was killing him.

958
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,966
I'd plead with him.

959
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,800
"You could do anything, Charlie,

960
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,533
"you could end up President of the United States

961
01:00:26,566 --> 01:00:30,133
"but you can't do this to an innocent man," I'd say.

962
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:33,633
Listen, if we can get Jerry to unload in front of a lawyer,

963
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:35,500
you've not only sprung that innocent kid

964
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:38,566
but you've nailed the police department and Haggerty!

965
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,833
I think you owe this much to Felix.

966
01:00:39,866 --> 01:00:41,966
Don't you be telling me who I owe!

967
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,266
I've done more for Felix than you or anybody else.

968
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,466
Well, why won't you go with me to Jerry?

969
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,233
Just answer me, God damn you!

970
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:52,733
You know, I really find you terribly irritating.

971
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:54,800
Jesus, not that song and dance again!

972
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,966
What astounds me is how you come to think of yourself

973
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,166
as such a high-grade, cultured individual and such a great Catholic.

974
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,966
In other words, this whole story has been bullshit!

975
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,333
When what you really are is guttural!

976
01:01:03,366 --> 01:01:05,066
You're not even using the word right!

977
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,966
Your whole manner is guttural because your whole background is guttural!

978
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,100
Okay, Lady Bushwa, pull out the nails.

979
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,466
And you can just stop calling me names, you stupid bastard!

980
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,866
Respectable ladies don't call people "stupid bastards".

981
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,566
Which I would be delighted to do if you stupid bastards

982
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,333
could understand any other kind of language, you dumb shit!

983
01:01:21,366 --> 01:01:22,666
Touche!

984
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,566
And, lady, you just convinced me from this minute

985
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,100
you don't know a goddamn thing about this case.

986
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,266
You never laid a hand on Charlie Haggerty,

987
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,500
except in your misbegotten dreams!

988
01:02:34,133 --> 01:02:36,333
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Yes, this is Father Mancini.

989
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:41,366
I'm chaplain at the correctional facility and a friend of Angela Crispini.

990
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,900
I have rather disturbing news about Felix Daniels.

991
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:47,200
I am seeing him at noon tomorrow.

992
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:50,133
Could you perhaps join me? I'm sure you could be of some help.

993
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,566
Thank you.

996
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:58,433
You said you were going to call me, what happened?

997
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:13,600
It's good of you to do this, Mr. O'Toole.

998
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:14,800
Mmm-hmm.

999

(DOOR CLOSES)

1000
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:48,633
You've got to hold on, Felix.

1001
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:52,266
Not to get too discouraged.

1002
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,866
It's not going to go on forever, like you think.

1003
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:01,600
Just drink this.

1004
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:06,100
I want you to start eating, get your strength back.

1005
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,700
I want you to focus your thoughts.

1006
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,400
I'm going to be back in a week.

1007
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,566
I'm going to have news for you, Felix.

1008
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,433
Hold on.

1009
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:49,233
He wouldn't say a word.

1010
01:04:49,266 --> 01:04:52,700
No, but what matters is seeing you.

1011
01:04:52,733 --> 01:04:54,633
He needs to know there's somebody on his side

1012
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:55,966
and he trusts you.

1013
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,200
Right, Father.

1014
01:04:57,233 --> 01:04:58,833
You will be back, I hope.

1015
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:00,100
Yes. I told him I would be.

1016
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:04,233
Mr. O'Toole.

1017
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,766
We should talk further.

1018
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,900
How about this evening at St. Jude's?

1019
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:11,866
Sure, Father.

1020
01:05:15,766 --> 01:05:17,433
The body of Christ.

1021
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,033
The body of Christ.

1022
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,500
The body of Christ.

1023
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,233
The body of Christ.

1024

You know, Angela's spoken about you so often, I'm glad we've met.

1025
01:06:02,966 --> 01:06:04,966
She talked about you too, Father.

1026
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,100
I guess you know you're her favorite fella in the whole world right now.

1027
01:06:08,133 --> 01:06:09,300
Not quite.

1028
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,700
I think you are.

1029
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:15,366
She is terribly worried, you know,

1030
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,566
that you may give up on this case.

1031
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,700
I hope you're not. Are you?

1032
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,666
I don't know.

1033
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:40,933
Did she ask you to talk to me?

1034
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,000
Did she?

1035
01:06:46,066 --> 01:06:50,200
Mr. O'Toole, you are her lifeline now.

1036
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:52,233
You are all that connects her to reality.

All right. I'll tell him where you are.

01:07:55,066 --> 01:07:56,333
What happened?

1047
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:04,600
Do you want to talk about it?

1048
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,033

(QUIETLY) Haggerty.

1050
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:15,533
Charlie Haggerty beat you up?

1051
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:18,333
Why?

1052
01:08:20,466 --> 01:08:22,266
Come on, Angela, talk to me.

1053
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,366
He came to get his letters back.

1054
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:26,666
What letters?

1055
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:29,100
You have letters from him?

1056
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,166
You mean like love letters?

1057
01:08:32,466 --> 01:08:34,933
And about the case. One of them.

1058
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:37,766
Actually referring to it?

1059
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,933
Asking me not to let it get between us because of what he had to do.

1060
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:43,433
Did you give them to him?

1061
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,200
No.

1062
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:48,133
My God, Angela, if you've got something like that

1063
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,133
do you know, it wraps it all up, don't you?

1064
01:08:50,866 --> 01:08:52,433
But it would destroy him.

1065
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:53,566
Well?

1066
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:57,733
I can't bear to do that to him.

1067
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:00,933
Honey, he is the chief law enforcement officer in this county

1068
01:09:00,966 --> 01:09:03,066
and he knowingly rigs a murder case?

1069
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,700
He's got to be destroyed.

1070
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,600
But how can I do that to him?

1071
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,533
He was the love of my life.

1072
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,233
(SIGHING)

1073
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:21,733
A man who takes his fist to a woman

1074
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:24,166
ought to be strung up by his balls!

1075
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,100
He just lost his temper.

1076
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:28,300
He's done it before.

1077
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,833
He come with the cops?

1078
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:35,633
No, alone.

1079
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:37,366
But I'm afraid he might come back.

1080
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:40,733
You want out of this or do you want to go on being treated like shit?

1081
01:09:41,966 --> 01:09:43,633
Answer me! What do you want?

1082
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,000
Out.

1083
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:48,100
Then let me take you home right now.

1084
01:09:48,133 --> 01:09:50,933
You give me one of his letters and we finish the case

1085
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:53,166
and you can start living like a human being.

1086
01:09:55,866 --> 01:09:56,966
Okay.

1087
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,466
Boy, he sure did a job on this place.

1088
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,566
No! Give it to me! You tricked me!

1089
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,100
(SHOUTING)

1090
01:10:57,133 --> 01:10:58,933
It's my property! You're a goddamn thief!

1091
01:10:58,966 --> 01:11:00,300
I want my property! I'll go to the cops.

1092
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,733
I'll tell them you stole my property...

1093
01:11:01,766 --> 01:11:05,266
You called me in to dig up just enough to get Felix out, is that it?

1094
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,333
But without touching anybody else!

1095
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:11,000
And now you're asking me to protect the bastard that put him in there?

1096
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,733
You've been trying to go north, south and powder your nose all in the same time!

1097
01:11:16,766 --> 01:11:19,066
But that can't be done, baby, not with me!

1098
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:22,733
(CRYING) Please, Tom.

1099
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:35,066
Okay. You give me one sentence in a letter from Haggerty and I'm your man.

1100
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,300
Otherwise you been full of shit from day one and I'm out of your life.

1101
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:43,033
(SNIFFLING)

1102
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,033
(MOTORCYCLE STARTS)

1103
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,566
What?

1104
01:12:22,866 --> 01:12:25,566
(STUTTERING) Jerry's bad. You got to talk to him.

1105
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:27,700
I'll be right there.

1106
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,066
JERRY: We were going to call on Angela. Remember?

1107
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:20,500
Jerry...

1108
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,200
You came just in time.

1109
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,266
Ain't you two got work to do?

1110
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,666
(SHEEP BLEATING)

1111
01:14:31,966 --> 01:14:32,966
(LAUGHS)

1112
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,833
It's beautiful.

1113
01:14:40,466 --> 01:14:41,966
You got yourself a church.

1114
01:14:45,966 --> 01:14:48,166
People are going to want to come here.

1115
01:14:52,933 --> 01:14:54,433
But I am unclean.

1116
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:01,400
Truthfully, I've been wondering about that myself.

1117
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:08,600
You know they say coke is high and smack is higher

1118
01:15:10,566 --> 01:15:13,533
but there is no high on God's Earth like a true confession.

1119
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:18,000
I've been wanting to say this to you.

1120
01:15:20,566 --> 01:15:23,100
I ran your situation by an old friend of mine,

1121
01:15:25,033 --> 01:15:28,233
retired federal judge, smart as a whip.

1122
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:35,833
He says if you would see him and talk out an affidavit

1123
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:38,366
saying how you tried to confess

1124
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,133
but the cops, they threw you back out on the street,

1125
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:44,700
he's sure the feds would let you walk.

1126
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,866
For helping him clean out City Hall.

1127
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,600
Because the town has gotten evil, Jerry.

1128
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:52,000
You know that.

1129
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:53,800
Man, you got no idea.

1130
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:56,033
About what?

1131
01:15:56,066 --> 01:15:57,900
All the people Daniels used to pay.

1132
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,766
Like who?

1133
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,466
Haggerty, Bellanca, everybody.

1134
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,000
I mean every month. He used to brag about it.

1135
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,433
All right.

1136
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,800
Jerry, that's the past.

1137
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,900
Now listen to me, you've gotten through that,

1138
01:16:13,933 --> 01:16:15,500
do you understand me?

1139
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:17,400
Yes. You're through it!

1140
01:16:17,433 --> 01:16:19,300
I mean, you've got yourself a church here!

1141
01:16:20,733 --> 01:16:23,933
You've got something important to say to people.

1142
01:16:23,966 --> 01:16:26,233
You've got a whole life ahead of you, Jerry.

1143
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,700
You could cut yourself free.

1144
01:16:50,433 --> 01:16:52,400
I'll stick with you.

1145
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:54,233
I'll be right there.

1146
01:16:54,266 --> 01:16:55,666
(EXHALING)

1147
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,066
Angie know about this?

1148
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,300
Me coming here?

1149
01:17:05,766 --> 01:17:07,766
No. Why?

1150
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:16,200
All I wanted to do was to talk to Daniels about building my new church,

1151
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:17,900
but he wouldn't listen to me.

1152
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,133
And he owed me money.

1153
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:23,866
But he wouldn't even open the goddamn door and he had like five locks.

1154
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,566
Wait, wait, Jerry, wait a second. I'm not following you here.

1155
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,633
Well, he'd always open up for her.

1156
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:35,400
Angela was with you?

1157
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:38,166
I wasn't expecting to do anything, I swear.

1158
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,300
Right.

1159
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:44,633
So what did you do? Hide till he opened the door?

1160
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:46,600
Yeah! And what did she do?

1161
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,933
I don't know.

1162
01:17:48,966 --> 01:17:52,000
She didn't go inside with you, did she?

1163
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:54,166
I think so. I don't remember.

1164
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,166
I just lost my mind. He really pissed me off.

1165
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,433
But why did she go with you?

1166
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:03,733
I asked her.

1167
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:20,333
Right.

1168
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,300
Okay, let's go see the judge right now.

1169
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,566
Wait...

1170
01:18:31,133 --> 01:18:33,433
What's going to happen to Angela?

1171
01:18:33,466 --> 01:18:35,800
Jerry, this is going to get her clear, too.

1172
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:38,566
You're saving her.

1173
01:18:44,733 --> 01:18:46,000
All right.

1174
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,400
(HONKING)

1175
01:19:56,633 --> 01:19:57,666
(SQUEALING)

1176
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,766
Angela,

1177
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,633
Jerry told me what went down the night he did it to Daniels.

1178
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,200
You're an accessory to homicide.

1179
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,533
I'd love a B&B.

1180
01:20:51,433 --> 01:20:54,400
A B&B for the lady?

1181
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:57,966
This is what you were trying to cough up, wasn't it, from day one?

1182
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,266
I'd like to go dancing, do you want to?

1183
01:21:05,066 --> 01:21:06,966
Did you ever confess it to your priest?

1184
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,600
No, huh?

1185
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:20,300
Listen, I had a talk with Judge Murdoch.

1186
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,700
He'd be willing to see you.

1187
01:21:22,733 --> 01:21:26,100
Your eyewitness testimony places Jerry at the scene

1188
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:28,566
a few minutes before the murder.

1189
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,333
And that just about clears Felix.

1190
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,666
And what happens to me?

1191
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,233
You are in real trouble.

1192
01:21:37,366 --> 01:21:39,633
That's why you ought to talk to the judge.

1193
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,800
I'd love to go somewhere.

1194
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:50,500
Please, Angie, it's not going to go away.

1195
01:22:06,933 --> 01:22:10,000
The thing is, if I ever got up on a witness stand,

1196
01:22:10,033 --> 01:22:12,400
God knows what I'd start saying.

1197
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,833
Like what?

1198
01:22:14,866 --> 01:22:19,166
Well, like I might have made all that up about Charlie.

1199
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,066
I'm not absolutely sure.

1200
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,166
No kiddin'.

1201
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,600
I don't know. I mean, I'm almost sure of it and then every once in a while I...

1202
01:22:26,633 --> 01:22:29,333
But you remember going to the doctor's house with Jerry.

1203
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,366
I'm not... I'm not sure.

1204
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,166
No kiddin'.

1205
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,833
Maybe I dreamed it all.

1206
01:22:36,866 --> 01:22:39,966
Look, I told you I talked to Jerry.

1207
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,333
Jerry was brain damaged.

1208
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:43,733
That wasn't the first time he tried to kill himself, you know.

1209
01:22:43,766 --> 01:22:45,200
Because he murdered Daniels!

1210
01:22:45,233 --> 01:22:46,400
He nearly hacked his head off!

1211
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:48,800
He damn near cut his heart out of his chest!

1212
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,433
Nobody dreamed that!

1213
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,166
You saw it all, didn't you?

1214
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,933
You went inside with him, is that it?

1215
01:22:56,966 --> 01:23:00,666
You saw him try to cut his head off, is that what's driving you crazy?

1216
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,600
What'd you do, help hold him down?

1217
01:23:02,633 --> 01:23:05,966
Is that it? You held Daniels down for him, Angela?

1218
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,433
(LAUGHING) What are you laughing at?

1219
01:23:08,466 --> 01:23:10,366
Stop laughing at me!

1220
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,933
You realize what you're saying to me?

1221
01:23:12,966 --> 01:23:16,800
You hear your own words? I helped cut a man's head off?

1222
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,433
Do you hear your mouth?

1223
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,400
Maybe now you get the feeling, do you?

1224
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:28,566
That everything is possible and impossible at the same time, right?

1225
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,433
You feel it?

1226
01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:32,866
This is what I live with all the time!

1227
01:23:50,566 --> 01:23:52,866
We've got to talk to the judge.

1228
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:56,200
I know him, he'll find a way out for you.

1229
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,600
How do I look?

1230
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:32,800
Great. Beautiful.

1231
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,333
Tom,

1232
01:24:40,566 --> 01:24:42,033
could I do this on my own?

1233
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,700
All right.

1234
01:24:45,733 --> 01:24:47,266
Remember, he can only give you a half hour.

1235
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:49,233
(SOFTLY) Right.

1236
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:51,700
Hi, Tom. Judge.

1237
01:24:51,733 --> 01:24:54,000
Well, how are you doing, Mrs. Crispini?

1238
01:24:54,033 --> 01:24:56,000
Hello, sir. Come in. Come in.

1239
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,366
When should I come back for her?

1240
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,333
I'll hear her out, then Jack can take her home.

1241
01:25:02,366 --> 01:25:05,066
Judge, I don't have to tell you how grateful I am.

1242
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,566
Oh, sure, sure.

1243
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,800
What time is it?

1244
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,100
Oh, about half past 10.

1245
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:47,233
What!

1246
01:25:47,266 --> 01:25:49,366
Yeah, you slept in late.

1247
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,000
Load must be off your back.

1248
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:56,533
Tom, this is Jean in Judge Murdoch's office.

1249
01:25:56,566 --> 01:25:58,933
The judge would like you to call him at home.

1250
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,166
Judge, Tom.

1251
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,000
What's happening?

1252
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:07,100
Tom, listen, she's got a remarkable story and I've decided to get into it.

1253
01:26:07,133 --> 01:26:08,633
That is great!

1254
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:11,366
Did you know that this Haggerty actually battered her around?

1255
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,866
She told you all that?

1256
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,266
Now, look, I've sent her out of state for her own safety

1257
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,966
just in case somebody tries to get at her.

1258
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,400
Where is she?

1259
01:26:18,433 --> 01:26:20,166
Tom, this is a job for a lawyer.

1260
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,700
And I've got it under control.

1261
01:26:21,733 --> 01:26:24,300
Now just sit back and let me take it from here.

1262
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:25,766
Sure! Fantastic!

1263
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,033
I'll call you at the end of the week.

1264
01:26:27,066 --> 01:26:28,100
Right.

1265
01:26:28,133 --> 01:26:30,100
Something's happening. Connie!

1266
01:26:31,266 --> 01:26:33,166
She told the judge the real story.

1267
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,333
Well, that's good news.

1268
01:26:34,366 --> 01:26:35,833
I mean, the man was outraged!

1269
01:26:35,866 --> 01:26:37,433
He'll take those punks to the cleaners.

1270
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:39,033
That guy's Ted Williams on a good day.

1271
01:26:39,066 --> 01:26:40,333
He'll murder the bums.

1272
01:26:40,366 --> 01:26:42,633
I'm happy for you, Tom.

1273
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:44,966
Thanks for hanging in there with me, Connie.

1274
01:26:52,266 --> 01:26:53,333
Jean!

1275
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:58,166
The judge wants to see you on Friday, Tom.

1276
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,200
I got the message. Look, I really need to reach Mrs. Crispini

1277
01:27:01,233 --> 01:27:03,100
and I know you can tell me where she is.

1278
01:27:03,133 --> 01:27:05,433
You know better than to ask me that, Tom.

1279
01:27:05,466 --> 01:27:08,000
Jean, I've got to know what's going on!

1280
01:27:08,033 --> 01:27:10,333
Well, I really shouldn't tell you this

1281
01:27:10,366 --> 01:27:12,866
but you know the lady who presided at the Daniels hearing?

1282
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,533
Judge Yablonsky? What about her?

1283
01:27:14,566 --> 01:27:17,100
The judge is having lunch with her on Thursday.

1284
01:27:17,133 --> 01:27:18,300
He is!

1285
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:20,600
Jean, I love you!

1286
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,533
Come on!

1287
01:27:46,633 --> 01:27:47,966
Hi, Jean. Where is he?

1288
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,066
Inside.

1289
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,966
What's going on? Don't ask!

1290
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,900
Yeah, come on in.

1291
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,966
Well, I just got your boy out on bail.

1292
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,466
What!

1293
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,600
I've decided to take on the case myself.

1294
01:28:08,633 --> 01:28:10,366
My God, Judge.

1295
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,666
Yeah, there was no question, the state held back exculpatory evidence.

1296
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,433
It's a technicality but it'll get him a new trial.

1297
01:28:16,466 --> 01:28:19,033
And who's going to fight it now that this Jerry kook is dead.

1298
01:28:19,066 --> 01:28:20,933
You are unbelievable.

1299
01:28:20,966 --> 01:28:23,000
Then she told you the whole story, huh?

1300
01:28:23,033 --> 01:28:24,766
This trial is going to bring the whole thing crashing down

1301
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,900
on Haggerty, Bellanca, the whole damn police department, right?

1302
01:28:28,933 --> 01:28:31,733
I sprung Felix, Tom. That'll have to be the end of it.

1303
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:33,466
What do you mean, Judge?

1304
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,266
I've sprung Felix, and that will be the end of it!

1305
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,433
But didn't she tell you Haggerty took payoffs? So did Bellanca!

1306
01:28:38,466 --> 01:28:39,500
Tom, you heard me...

1307
01:28:39,533 --> 01:28:40,933
But you haven't got the whole picture, Judge!

1308
01:28:40,966 --> 01:28:42,566
She could blow the roof off this city!

1309
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,100
This woman has been through enough!

1310
01:28:45,133 --> 01:28:48,366
And I must tell you, I think you've been damn rough on her.

1311
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,466
Me?

1312
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:54,466
This is a sensitive human being. A deep human being.

1313
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,266
And I will not allow her to be tortured any further by this case!

1314
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:00,000
My God, Harry, you can't tell me that you are going to...

1315
01:29:00,033 --> 01:29:01,966
Felix is out, and that's it!

1316
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,366
She can't save the goddamn world.

1317
01:29:12,733 --> 01:29:14,166
Put it down over here, okay.

1318
01:29:19,266 --> 01:29:20,400
Tom!

1319
01:29:21,533 --> 01:29:23,533
You deserve credit for this.

1320
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,233
I'll make sure the press hears about it.

1321

Come, come in!

1324
01:30:02,733 --> 01:30:04,566
Tom, where have you been?

1325
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,566
Where have I been?

1326
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,766
We got Felix out, can you believe it!

1327
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,400
I got the Judge to send a car for him

1328
01:30:10,433 --> 01:30:12,166
so he'll be here for the party!

1329
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,800
Would you like some white wine?

1330
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:18,866
Can you imagine Charlie Haggerty's face when he sees him?

1331
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,800
Isn't this some place Harry's got here?

1332
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,733
He's such a marvelous human being and what a brain.

1333
01:30:24,766 --> 01:30:26,700
You were so right about him.

1334
01:30:26,733 --> 01:30:29,833
I mean, it's fantastic what he's done. This way, everybody wins.

1335
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,000
Almost, yeah.

1336
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:33,400
Why?

1337
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,233
Felix is out. What more do you want?

1338
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:37,233
"This case goes to the top of the mountain!"

1339
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:39,066
I thought I heard you say that once.

1340
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,066
Well, this is the top of the mountain.

1341
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,633
With what you know we could have bombed hell out of this town.

1342
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:47,566
We really could.

1343
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,766
Or was anything like that ever in your mind?

1344
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,000
Even for a minute?

1345
01:30:52,033 --> 01:30:54,933
In other words, Felix is out, the monkey's off your back

1346
01:30:54,966 --> 01:30:56,600
and everything else stays exactly the same.

1347
01:30:56,633 --> 01:30:59,333
It doesn't bother you for one split second does it?

1348
01:30:59,366 --> 01:31:00,566
What a horse's ass!

1349
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,833
No, Tom, don't say that.

1350
01:31:02,866 --> 01:31:04,533
So what's next?

1351
01:31:04,566 --> 01:31:06,900
You climb back in the hammock with Haggerty?

1352
01:31:06,933 --> 01:31:10,033
Or some other gorilla who has something you might happen to want?

1353
01:31:13,533 --> 01:31:15,566
Christ, now you've got me doing it!

1354
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,600
Tom, you know what they would have done to me.

1355
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:22,000
We saved a man.

1356
01:31:22,033 --> 01:31:23,800
It's the one good thing I've ever done.

1357
