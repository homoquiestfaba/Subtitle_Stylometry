00:51:51,493 --> 00:51:52,561
Ah!

1032
00:51:54,596 --> 00:51:56,565
Did your mama have her wings?

1033
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:57,699
Yes.

1034
00:51:57,733 --> 00:51:59,167
LES: Where does
she keep her wings?

1035
00:52:00,569 --> 00:52:03,705
She keeps them in her back,
folded.

1036
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:06,107
LES: Oh, she folds them up.

1037
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,975
I got wings. You see my wings?

1038
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:10,044
Check these out.

1039
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:11,245
Look at that.

1040
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,715
When you're gonna get your ones?

1041
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:16,385
Hmm. Soon.

1042
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:19,020
Oh yeah?

1043
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,390
How come you're here now?

1044
00:52:21,423 --> 00:52:27,396
Because there was people
at our house, so we ran.

1045
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:30,064
LES: Oh yeah? What were
they doin' at your house?

1046
00:52:30,097 --> 00:52:31,533
Yellin'.

1047
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:35,537
Yellin' at you? Yeah, scary?

1048
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:37,473
Hmm, yes.

1049
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:39,708
LES: Yeah.

1050
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,310
It's not so bad here, huh?

1051
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:46,782
So, where's your daddy at?

1052
00:52:46,815 --> 00:52:48,015
Hmm?

1053
00:52:55,424 --> 00:52:56,358
Okay.

1054
00:52:58,694 --> 00:52:59,994
Okay.

1055
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:07,636
[squeaking]

1056
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:10,104
NIKKI: Hey!

1057
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:11,473
- Les.
- LES: What happened?

1058
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:12,808
- What is this?
- LES: What's up?

1059
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:13,475
Can you please take her out?

1060
00:53:13,509 --> 00:53:14,543
She wanted to see her mama.

1061
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:16,678
- NIKKI: Hey, Baby, you okay?
- We got a half hour

1062
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:17,679
and then it's back-to-back
till you're done...

1063
00:53:17,713 --> 00:53:19,815
- I got sweat.
- So, we should do this shit now.

1064
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:21,215
NIKKI: I don't know
why the fuck she's in here?

1065
00:53:21,249 --> 00:53:22,518
LES: Why... she...
she missed her mama.

1066
00:53:22,551 --> 00:53:23,652
You don't wanna see your girl?

1067
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:24,353
NIKKI: I specifically told you
to keep her out of here.

1068
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:25,186
LES: She misses you, you know?

1069
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:26,421
NIKKI: You're okay, Baby,
it's okay.

1070
00:53:26,455 --> 00:53:29,358
LES: Listen, I was done with you
after that shit you pulled,

1071
00:53:29,391 --> 00:53:31,460
but you're too good
for business.

1072
00:53:31,493 --> 00:53:33,729
Your mama, she's my best girl.

1073
00:53:33,762 --> 00:53:34,630
Long as she keep her mouth shut.

1074
00:53:34,663 --> 00:53:36,598
Hey, just lay down, Baby,
just lay down.

1075
00:53:36,632 --> 00:53:37,466
Well, you ain't gonna say
"thanks"?

1076
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:39,768
There you go.
Just give me a second.

1077
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:42,270
LES: Come on,
that ain't the Nikki I know.

1078
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:45,507
You know, I... I... maybe
I was harsh before, you know?

1079
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:49,711
Maybe uh, I wasn't being fair,
so I don't wanna do this shit.

1080
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:51,513
We're gonna do it right,
we're gonna do a 70-30.

1081
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:52,514
Like I said in the beginning,

1082
00:53:52,548 --> 00:53:54,850
I ain't gonna fuck with you
like that, right?

1083
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:57,586
You know, you deserve it,
you've been workin' hard.

1084
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:59,120
- [lighter flicking]
- LES: You do it proper.

1085
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,189
You know what else?
You stay here tonight.

1086
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:04,560
Your girl, too.
You ain't gotta pay for her.

1087
00:54:04,593 --> 00:54:06,193
I mean, with me,
you got all the shit you need,

1088
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:07,429
you know that?

1089
00:54:07,462 --> 00:54:08,530
It could be like that.
I'm tryin' to...

1090
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:09,565
NIKKI: What are you...
what are you talking about?

1091
00:54:09,598 --> 00:54:10,264
- What do you want?
- LES: I'm... I want nothing.

1092
00:54:10,298 --> 00:54:11,033
I'm just saying that you know,

1093
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:13,402
I want you to stay here,
you know?

1094
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:14,736
You came here, 'cause you needed
a place to stay,

1095
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,405
so I want you to stay here.

1096
00:54:16,438 --> 00:54:18,272
I wanna take care of you,
it's what I do.

1097
00:54:18,307 --> 00:54:20,809
And your girl, too, you know?

1098
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:23,645
Your girl, too,
she stays here till you...

1099
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:25,279
Till you figure your shit out.

1100
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:30,385
All right, yo, tie up, come on.

1101
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:31,587
Oh, what the fuck?

1102
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,622
No, we... we got a place to stay.

1103
00:54:33,655 --> 00:54:35,324
- LES: Oh, why you lyin'?
- We got a place to stay.

1104
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:36,592
LES: No, you're fuckin' lying!

1105
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:37,893
Why you doin' that shit?
Come on.

1106
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:40,161
Don't do...
don't be like that to me.

1107
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,697
I'm a good guy right? Right?

1108
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,799
We've been havin' a good time.
Right, girlie?

1109
00:54:43,832 --> 00:54:45,534
Hey, don't touch her.

1110
00:54:47,168 --> 00:54:48,470
LES: I'ma take care of you.
- Just... right.

1111
00:54:48,503 --> 00:54:49,871
- Right? You know that.
- NIKKI: I know.

1112
00:54:49,905 --> 00:54:50,839
- NIKKI: I mean like...
- You know that. Yeah.

1113
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:53,842
NIKKI: I'm working for you.
That's it, okay?

1114
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,410
- LES: So what?
- Just... you don't...

1115
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:56,812
- I don't want?
- NIKKI: Ne... you don't need...

1116
00:54:56,845 --> 00:54:58,347
I don't what?

1117
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,147
NIKKI: You don't need
to bring her into this.

1118
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:02,684
LES: Yeah, if you want...
you want to talk about this,

1119
00:55:02,718 --> 00:55:05,387
we're talkin' about this
right now.

1120
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,223
Look, these guys,
they're gonna take care of her.

1121
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:13,662
They'll barely touch her,
none of that shit.

1122
00:55:13,695 --> 00:55:15,262
But this could be
thousands of dollars.

1123
00:55:15,296 --> 00:55:18,734
This could be crazy, though,
for you and me, all right?

1124
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:20,702
You know how rare shit is?

1125
00:55:20,736 --> 00:55:22,838
A kid like this
that's this fuckin' chill?

1126
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:24,873
You know how much money
they'll pay for that?

1127
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:26,875
You... you just put her in a room
with them for a little bit.

1128
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:28,343
- Stop.
- LES: Huh?

1129
00:55:28,377 --> 00:55:29,511
- NIKKI: No.
- LES: Just listen to me.

1130
00:55:29,544 --> 00:55:30,612

- Just listen to me.

1131
00:55:30,646 --> 00:55:32,547
- NIKKI: Shut up.
- No. Gee, no!

1132
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:34,683
LES: You're still workin' for me
for another three fuckin' hours!

1133
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,752
So, you shut the fuck up
and listen!

1134
00:55:36,785 --> 00:55:39,253
I'll call the fucking cops
right now! Huh?

1135
00:55:39,286 --> 00:55:41,423
I can rip this kid right out
of your junky ass hands.

1136
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:42,858
Tell 'em that you've been
keeping her in the tunnels

1137
00:55:42,891 --> 00:55:44,760
in the fucking dark
like she don't exist.

1138
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:46,395
And then what? You in prison

1139
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:48,229
and she's in the fuckin' system
the rest of her life?

1140
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,399
You want that shit?
Where you goin', huh?

1141
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:51,800
- Where are you goin'?
- Les, I'm gonna fuckin' scream.

1142
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,101
I think you need to sit down
and do some of this shit.

1143
00:55:53,135 --> 00:55:54,136
- You ain't thinkin' straight.
- NIKKI: I don't need your shit.

1144
00:55:54,168 --> 00:55:55,302
- LITTLE: Mama.
- NIKKI: I don't need your dope.

1145
00:55:55,337 --> 00:55:56,505
Yo.

1146
00:55:56,538 --> 00:55:57,204
I need you
to get the fuck out of my way.

1147
00:55:57,238 --> 00:55:58,272
You need to fuckin' lie down.

1148
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:04,479
Come on, lay down.

1149
00:56:04,513 --> 00:56:06,915
What are you doing?

1150
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,583
Nikki, come on.

1151
00:56:08,617 --> 00:56:10,419

I'm tryin' to help you out,
I'm tryin' to get you paid,

1155

I'm tryin'
to get you some fuckin' money,

1156
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:25,767
so you can
get the fuck out of here.

I have to do this first.
