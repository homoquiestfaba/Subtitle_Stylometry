00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,086
I give a damn.

532
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,424
They killed Eddie and the girl because we're right on their ass.

533
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,459
They could have been killed by anyone, Frank.

534
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:15,763
No. No, she had a name for me.

535
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:21,269
I'll tell you something else.

536
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:23,139
There's a federal agent involved.

537
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:26,642
How the hell do you know this?

538
00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:29,546
I know. I know.

539
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,781
Pieces of a puzzle, Joe. Pieces of a puzzle.

540
00:38:31,815 --> 00:38:33,617
They're all coming together.

541
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,287
All I need is two weeks. One week even.

542
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,290
Look, it's out of my hands. It's not my decision anymore.

543
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:41,360
You're getting blamed for Hojo's death.

544
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:47,800
You missed one.

545
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:48,835
I don't kill cops.

546
00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:06,355
(INAUDIBLE)

547
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,023
ORSINI: Before the formal hearing begins, Lieutenant Daly,

548
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,092
let me fill you in on the procedure.

549
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,797
You have been charged with violating your inactive status

550
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,299
resulting in the fatality of Officer Howard Jones.

551
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:47,503
The med-psych report notes

552
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:51,741
obsessive, stress-related behavior.

553
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:55,379
Now departmental regulations state...

554
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:57,248
Let me make it easy on you, Commander.

555
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:59,851
Frank, you'll have a chance to respond at the proper time.

556
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:00,986
I resign.

557
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,592
We might as well save ourselves a lot of bullshit here.

558
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:10,797
I quit.

559
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,135
It's really what you want, isn't it?

560
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,709
They're burying us in their shit out there.

561
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:30,487
And when you finally get rid of all the cops like me

562
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:35,226
who's gonna stop them?

563
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:37,995
You?

564
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,409
TRAVERS: The policeman has resigned.

565
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:51,411
And they've disbanded his unit,

566
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:52,546
so your position is safe.

567
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:54,581
Good. That's good.

568
00:40:54,615 --> 00:40:56,350
By the way, I've been ordered back to Washington.

569
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:59,287
So, I'll say goodbye.

570
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,455
Well, thank you.

571
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:02,958
We appreciate everything you've done for us.

572
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:04,260
Thanks again.

573
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,636
That was Travers on the phone.

574
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:14,504
He took care of that little problem we were having.

575
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,710
CALVERT: Now, where are we on the money?

576
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,482
There's been a little trouble with one of our sources of finance.

577
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:25,651
You see, there was a fire...

578
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:27,186
Norringer, I don't wanna know anything

579
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:30,290
about your sources or your problems.

580
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,492
You know that.

581
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:34,161
I trust you to work these things out.

582
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:37,465
Look, it just means a short delay before I can wire the money

583
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:40,035
into the overseas account. Well, how long?

584
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:41,169
A week. Ten days.

585
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:42,237
That's too late.

586
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:46,676
Our friends are in an emergency situation, for God's sake.

587
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:49,178
We need all the money within 48 hours.

588
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:55,919
The exchange must go ahead as planned.

589
00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:59,057
And all cash.

590
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:02,360
That's very dangerous.

591
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:04,697
That's the way it has to be.

592
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:08,768
Yo, boss.

593
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,839
So, what's it feel like being a civilian?

594
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:14,341
Boring.

595
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:15,709
(CHUCKLING) All right.

596
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,579
Everything's back to normal. Frank's drinking again.

597
00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:20,448
Come on. Let's all get loaded.

598
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:23,419
So, where did they stick you guys?

599
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,221
I'm back where I started.

600
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:28,425
The Crash Unit.

601
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:31,394
Gang Intelligence?

602
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:33,696
That's a contradiction in terms if I've ever heard one.

603
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,169
What about you, Wayne?

604
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:40,739
They shoved me back to Technical Development Wing.

605
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:42,774
An office pogue again, huh?

606
00:42:42,808 --> 00:42:44,910
Well, I bet Harriet's a lot happier about that.

607
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:47,079
Look, Frank, I just want you to know

608
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:48,981
I told 'em how I felt about

609
00:42:49,015 --> 00:42:50,383
the bullshit they put you through.

610
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,152
Oh, yeah? Like they give a shit, right?

611
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,755
Fuck 'em.

612
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:57,558
Take their money, do your time,

613
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:59,627
play with your kids, retire to Arizona.

614
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,662
No.

615
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:03,131
I quit this morning.

616
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:07,970
What about your pension?

617
00:43:09,805 --> 00:43:12,409
You got a family. You got a spotless record.

618
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:14,277
Well, I quit with a spotless record.

619
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:16,614
Looks good on a resume.

620
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:18,549
Frank, you know me. I always follow good orders,

621
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:19,984
good or bad, but this was bullshit.

622
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:21,786
Fuck their pension.

623
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:24,957
(CHUCKLING) All I got to do is tell Harriet.

624
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,626
Shit!

625
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:33,133
Well, I ain't quitting.

626
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,136
FRANK: Ricky, relax. Nobody's asking you to quit.

627
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,440
Hey, listen, I want Hojo's killer just like you guys want him, all right?

628
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:40,642
But what do I...

629
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:44,479
I can't do nothing about it cleaning swimming pools

630
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:45,882
or some bullshit like that.

631
00:43:47,517 --> 00:43:49,018
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

632
00:43:49,051 --> 00:43:52,122
Haven't you been able to figure this shit out yet?

633
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:55,392
What do you think? The department is gonna go after Hojo's killer?

634
00:43:56,693 --> 00:43:59,531
Wayne, don't give me this paranoid bullshit. What do you think?

635
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:01,933
This is not paranoia.

636
00:44:01,966 --> 00:44:05,504
They wanted us off the case, well, they got us off the case.

637
00:44:05,538 --> 00:44:09,275
What the hell do you think that FBI guy was doing at Frank's hearing?

638
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:11,077
Look, man, we're on our own on this one.

639
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:13,213
Frank,

640
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:17,718
I know you got a raw deal, got screwed.

641
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:22,524
But I...

642
00:44:22,558 --> 00:44:24,626
I can't quit the force, man.

643
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,663
You know what it means to me. I can't do it.

644
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:28,865
What am I supposed to do?

645
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,301
Go back to the barrio and hang out with the homeboys?

646
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:33,636
Homeboy, my ass.

647
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,006
Ricky, the only spic thing about you is your name.

648
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,909
If you could find your old man, I bet he'd turn out to be Irish.

649
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:41,479
You son of a bitch! Hey! Hey! Hey!

650
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,214
What the fuck is the matter with you? Get over there!

651
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:46,018
Knock it off, Wayne! You sit down and you shut the fuck up.

652
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,260
Ricky, you keep your badge. You earned it.

653
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:57,431
This is my problem anyway.

654
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,437
Frank, you ain't street legal no more.

655
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:05,341
You can't do this on your own.

656
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:06,942
No, Wayne's right about that, Ricky.

657
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:08,711
We can only do this on our own.

658
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:11,381
Okay. Here's what we do.

659
00:45:11,414 --> 00:45:13,550
I stay on the force and help you from the inside.

660
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:17,788
No, that's a bad idea, Ricky. It's bad for both of us.

661
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:20,791
We gotta break off all contact with the department.

662
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:23,128
Look, any kind of a leak would be fatal for us.

663
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:25,163
Besides, what happens to you if they ask you about us?

664
00:45:25,197 --> 00:45:26,798
You'd have to perjure yourself.

665
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:30,236
But, no, you need informants to keep you posted.

666
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,640
Look, don't worry about it. We'll find him.

667
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:35,776
Just don't go telling the cops on us.

668
00:45:37,544 --> 00:45:39,279
Wayne.

669
00:45:39,313 --> 00:45:41,316
You know, sometimes you can be a real asshole.

670
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:43,985
Sorry.

671
00:45:50,593 --> 00:45:53,330
Go on home. It's okay.

672
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:54,931
Frank, listen, I...

673
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:58,503
Look, it's okay. I understand. You're right.

674
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,405
I'll call you later. Okay?

675
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:02,674
Go on.

676
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:17,892
You shouldn't have called his old lady a spic.

677
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,695
I didn't call his old lady a spic.

678
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:22,931
I called his old man a mick.

679
00:46:22,964 --> 00:46:24,032
(CHUCKLES)

680
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:28,004
I can't believe he's keeping the job.

681
00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:30,039
Well, you see, that's exactly the point, Wayne.

682
00:46:30,073 --> 00:46:32,875
To you, it's a job. To him, it's his whole life.

683
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:39,416
Fuck it. I quit, too.

684
00:46:40,518 --> 00:46:42,554
How the hell did you get that door open?

685
00:46:42,587 --> 00:46:45,457
(CHUCKLING) Been stuck for 10 years, for Christ's sake.

686
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,492
Well...

687
00:46:48,894 --> 00:46:50,563
We better get drunk before we change our minds.

688
00:46:51,932 --> 00:46:53,033
Hot dogs are ready, guys.

689
00:46:53,066 --> 00:46:54,568
The burgers are gonna have to wait.

690
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:58,573
Who fixed the garage door? I did.

691
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:04,847
We're gonna need weapons.

692
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,215
We're going to need equipment.

693
00:47:06,248 --> 00:47:08,083
We're gonna need money.

694
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:13,423
(CHUCKLES)

695
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:15,793
What?

696
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,242
What's up? Nothing's up, man.

697
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:31,444
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO)

698
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,592
How is this shit, man?

699
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:46,428
Man, the shit's good. Come on, cold snap.

700
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,798
Got it all here.

701
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:50,666
And close that door behind you.

702
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:53,470
Holy shit!

703
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,339
Oh, shit!

704
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,314
Sanitation department!

705
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:07,686
Where's the garbage?

706
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:15,261
Keep that money down, God damn it.

707
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:16,630

00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:12,728
Want me to tell him you're here?

886
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,630
No, Myrna, we'll kick the door in.

887
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,436
And no Black Velvet, either.

888
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:21,939
He pees in the hall.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

890
00:59:26,611 --> 00:59:29,381
Ain't nobody getting in this door without a warrant.

FRANK: Tommy Grogan?

892
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:34,787
We got a warrant that says you're out of Black Velvet.

893
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,889
Hey, Frankie, boy. Come on in.

894
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:39,693
Come on in. How are you? How you doing, Wayne?

895
00:59:39,727 --> 00:59:42,630
Hey, Tom. How you doing, Ricky, boy?

896
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,632
FRANK: Yeah, we checked. We didn't have any tails.

897
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,735
Hey, good thing you brought this, man.

898
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:48,803
I was just about ready to knock over a 7-Eleven.

(ALL CHUCKLING)

900
00:59:49,938 --> 00:59:52,508
Let me close this door. There's a stink in here.

901

What the hell is all that shit about?

902
00:59:54,443 --> 00:59:57,280
Tommy, we got a tape we want you to look at.

903
00:59:57,314 --> 00:59:58,982
(CHUCKLING) I hope it's a porno.

904
01:00:00,117 --> 01:00:02,386
Hey, Frank, did I tell you about a guy

905
01:00:02,419 --> 01:00:04,455
who took a service revolver, put it to his head

906
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:06,257
and was gonna blow his brains out.

907
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:09,194
And his wife walks in and sees this and starts laughing.

908
01:00:09,228 --> 01:00:10,796
He says, "What the hell are you laughing at?

909
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:11,964
"You're next."

(ALL LAUGHING)

911
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:15,935
An Irish cop, right?

912
01:00:15,969 --> 01:00:17,637
Yeah, most likely.

913
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:19,139
Listen, Tommy, we need your help.

914
01:00:19,172 --> 01:00:21,175
We're trying to find Hojo's killers.

915
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:23,144
Hey, Frank, I'm sorry about that.

916
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:25,312
Yeah. I liked that big boy cop.

917
01:00:25,346 --> 01:00:26,982
I ought to come out of fucking retirement.

918
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:29,151
That's what I should do. All right, you're out of retirement.

919
01:00:29,184 --> 01:00:30,485
Do me a favor.

920
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:33,356

921
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:35,658
Hey, run that by me by me again there, huh?

922
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:39,329
Wait a minute. Let me get these Ben Franklins on.

923
01:00:39,363 --> 01:00:41,198
Don't worry about the stuff on the dais, okay?

924
01:00:41,231 --> 01:00:43,000
It's the two guys on the roof.

925

"The ship's at sea." Missed it.

926
01:00:45,537 --> 01:00:47,005
Run it back again. One more time.

927
01:00:47,038 --> 01:00:48,540
Run it back.

That's swell, thanks a lot. I'll be a son of a bitch.

Shit on a stoop. Who the fuck is that guy Norringer?

942

Did I blow it on a big one here?

943

No, no. Look, Tommy, we're still digging. You were a big help.

01:01:29,454 --> 01:01:31,089
We appreciate it.

945

Tommy, don't drink all that tonight.

Don't worry about it. Hey, put your safety belt on driving there, huh?

Ah, that's it there.

955
01:02:00,624 --> 01:02:02,425
FRANK: Get this. Norringer is a graduate

956
01:02:02,459 --> 01:02:04,462
of the United States Naval Academy.

957
01:02:04,495 --> 01:02:06,798
He's an ex-rear admiral, believe it or not.

958
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:08,766
The printout tells quite a story.

959
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,936
He was on the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence.

960
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:14,706
And he worked for the NSC as a specialist in the Mideast.

961
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,277
Resigned three years ago to enter the private sector.

962
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:20,079
Entered the private sector to make a fucking fortune.

963
01:02:20,113 --> 01:02:21,248
Yep.

964
01:02:22,516 --> 01:02:24,852

Shit.

966
01:02:33,262 --> 01:02:36,098
FRANK: Now part of this shipyard just happens to be leased

967
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:38,367
to R.J. Norringer and Associates.

968
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:42,439
What do we got so far?

969
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:44,943
Norringer's gotta be the man.

970
01:02:44,976 --> 01:02:47,345
Say he's using this shipyard to import drugs, right?

972
01:02:48,513 --> 01:02:49,681
the money goes out. Right.

Sometime in the next 24 hours

974
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:52,318
there may be a shipment or two.

975
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,320
Right. So...

976
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,088
So, what do we do next?

977
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,092
What's this?

978
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,295

986
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:49,884
First we gotta get inside this yard.

987
01:03:49,918 --> 01:03:51,220
Let me think about it for a minute.

988
01:03:51,253 --> 01:03:53,956
Wait a minute, Frank.

989
01:03:53,989 --> 01:03:57,260
Look, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, okay?

990
01:03:58,361 --> 01:03:59,930
But we're not on the force anymore.

991
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:04,702
Yeah. So?

992
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:06,570
So, we're volunteers just like you, Frank.

993
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:10,475
So, what does that mean? Nothing, I mean,

994
01:04:10,509 --> 01:04:12,311
we'd follow you anywhere. That's not the point...

995
01:04:12,344 --> 01:04:14,914
What he's trying to say is that together, right?

996
01:04:14,948 --> 01:04:16,582
The three of us should decide what we're going to do.

997
01:04:16,616 --> 01:04:18,418
Together. Right.

998
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:20,586
You mean like we should have like a committee.

999
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,589
No, a democracy.

1000
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:24,024
So, we take a vote. Yeah.

1001
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:25,392
Sure, of course. Why not? All right,

1002
01:04:25,426 --> 01:04:27,095
you guys propose something and then we'll vote on it.

1003
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,831
All right. So, go ahead. Propose something.

1004
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:32,233
Me? Yeah.

1005
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:33,569
Why not you? Go ahead.

1006
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:38,909
All right, I propose that you draw the plan of attack

1007
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,111
so that we can follow it.

1008
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:47,618
Yeah, I second it.

1009
01:04:47,652 --> 01:04:50,421
We'll make it unanimous. It's so ordered.

1010
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,959
Are we finished with this bullshit now?

1011
01:04:53,993 --> 01:04:55,794
Yeah. Good. Let's get out of here.

1012

1013
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:04,638
to get you up here for more Black Velvet?

1014

1022
01:05:25,162 --> 01:05:26,530

1232
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,650
Well, you won't be common, dear.

1233
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:30,454
WAYNE: Anita, please, for Christ's sake, would you lighten up?

1234
01:21:30,487 --> 01:21:33,858
I mean, this is the only chance any one of us will ever have to be rich.

1235
01:21:35,093 --> 01:21:37,629
Think about it. This is your pension.

1236
01:21:41,767 --> 01:21:43,302
I think we should do it.

1237
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:47,507
Yeah. I say we do it.

1238
01:21:51,512 --> 01:21:53,681
Look, it's been a long, tough day.

1239
01:21:53,714 --> 01:21:55,016
(SIGHS)

1240
01:21:55,716 --> 01:21:58,086
Why don't we sleep on it?

1241
01:22:12,736 --> 01:22:15,840
Baby, you awake? Mmm-hmm.

1242
01:22:19,044 --> 01:22:20,880
What are you thinking about?

1243
01:22:22,548 --> 01:22:24,550
I'm thinking about Anita.

1244
01:22:29,523 --> 01:22:31,158
Yeah, me, too.

1245
01:22:35,763 --> 01:22:37,498
The money.

1246
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:42,404
That money killed Tommy.

1247
01:22:44,241 --> 01:22:45,609
And Hojo.

1248
01:22:47,844 --> 01:22:49,546
We should all piss on that money.

01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:04,330
MAN ON TV: A well-armed patrol has attacked the small town of Las Citas,

1250
01:23:04,364 --> 01:23:05,732
near the Guatemalan border...

1251
01:23:05,765 --> 01:23:07,267
Sandanistan government forces have held out against the

1252
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,837
freedom fighters for several hours... MYRNA: Hello there.

1253
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:13,507
But fierce fighting still persists in the area and casualties are...

1254
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,776
I'm out.

1255
01:23:15,877 --> 01:23:18,913
Anything you can remember about this guy is important.

1256
01:23:18,947 --> 01:23:20,416
Garrity.

1257
01:23:21,717 --> 01:23:24,220
So, they killed Tommy.

1258
01:23:25,288 --> 01:23:27,924
Why would any bastard want to kill him?

1259
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:30,527
I don't know, Garrity. I was just asking Myrna here.

1260
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,031
What can you tell me about this guy that Tommy left with?

1261
01:23:33,064 --> 01:23:35,433
Some guy I never saw before.

1262
01:23:35,466 --> 01:23:38,103
Tommy was pretty drunk. Yeah.

1263
01:23:38,137 --> 01:23:40,272
Shitfaced he was.

1264
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:42,508
Captain Torres bought him a bottle.

1265
01:23:44,077 --> 01:23:45,478
Wait a minute. Torres was here?

1266
01:23:45,512 --> 01:23:48,948
Yeah. Just before he left with the guy.

1267
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,322
Frank?

Torres.

1270
01:24:15,447 --> 01:24:17,182
Did you kill Tommy?

1271
01:24:18,883 --> 01:24:21,020
You didn't kill Tommy, did you, Joe?

1272
01:24:23,122 --> 01:24:24,857
As good as, Frank.

1273
01:24:26,026 --> 01:24:27,894
I let someone else do it.

1274
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,368
(SIGHS)

1275
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,874
How much money did they pay you to kill Tommy Grogan?

1276
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:44,381
Enough, Frank. Oh, I took money, all right.

1277
01:24:46,182 --> 01:24:48,151
Why not?

1278
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:49,854
What difference does it make?

1279
01:24:49,887 --> 01:24:52,823
Who cares anymore? The war is over, Frank. We lost.

1280
01:24:52,857 --> 01:24:56,695
Oh, I see. We lie down and we just pretend we're dead, is that it?

1281
01:24:56,728 --> 01:24:59,865
We just bend over for these scumbags.

1282
01:24:59,898 --> 01:25:02,702
Is that it? Don't you get it?

1283
01:25:02,735 --> 01:25:05,138
Why don't you read the newspapers, Frank?

1284
01:25:05,171 --> 01:25:08,175
They're running the goddamn world now.

1285
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:10,544
Hell, they may even do some good.

1286
01:25:11,545 --> 01:25:14,048
What the fuck are you talking about?

1287
01:25:14,082 --> 01:25:16,684
You know that when Castro took over Cuba,

1288
01:25:17,685 --> 01:25:19,855
they killed my father and his two brothers.

1289
01:25:19,889 --> 01:25:21,624
One was a priest.

1290
01:25:22,258 --> 01:25:23,859
I watched it.

1291
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,963
You didn't know that, did you, Frank?

1292
01:25:27,597 --> 01:25:29,966
Know how I watched it?

1293
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,936
It was on television, man.

1294
01:25:33,104 --> 01:25:36,240
Those Communists have got to be stopped, no matter what.

1295
01:25:36,274 --> 01:25:37,575
Oh, no matter what? Yes!

1296
01:25:37,608 --> 01:25:39,945
No matter what, huh? No matter how.

1297
01:25:39,978 --> 01:25:42,614
Fuck the law, is that it, Joe?

1298
01:25:42,648 --> 01:25:44,851
Kill a pimp, kill a hooker, kill a cop.

1299
01:25:44,884 --> 01:25:46,786
For Christ's sake, what difference does it make?

1300
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,456
And if you can make a couple of bucks on the side, well, why not?

1301
01:25:49,489 --> 01:25:51,425
Who gives a shit anyway? Right?

1302
01:25:51,459 --> 01:25:53,594
It's all for a good cause.

1303
01:25:53,627 --> 01:25:55,229
Well, let me ask you something, Joe.

1304
01:25:55,262 --> 01:25:59,768
What makes you think you're any goddamn better than Castro? Huh?

1305
01:26:01,303 --> 01:26:03,406
Why don't you give the money back?

1306
01:26:04,173 --> 01:26:06,209
I promise you

1307
01:26:06,242 --> 01:26:07,778
that I'll call them off your family.

1308
01:26:07,811 --> 01:26:09,980
I can't do shit for you, but I'll do my best.

1309
01:26:10,013 --> 01:26:14,285
Norringer can have that money. He can have it tonight.

1310
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:16,287
Oh, he's not gonna come. Norringer comes.

1311
01:26:16,321 --> 01:26:17,956
He comes, or no deal. No money.

1312
01:26:17,989 --> 01:26:21,927
Now you look at me, Joe. You know me very well.

1313
01:26:21,961 --> 01:26:23,963
I got nothing to lose.

1314
01:26:23,996 --> 01:26:25,799
I will burn that goddamn money.

1315
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:27,000
Where?

1316
01:26:28,301 --> 01:26:30,470
Canyon Park. Midnight.

1317
01:26:30,504 --> 01:26:35,510
Yeah, we're building a playground for the kids. You remember the kids, Joe?

1318
01:26:35,543 --> 01:26:39,515
The kids you and your crack-peddling friends have helped to fuck up.

1319
01:26:39,548 --> 01:26:41,149
I'll try to get him there, Frank.

1320
01:26:41,183 --> 01:26:43,018
Midnight. Frank...

1321
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:47,190
I'm really sorry.

1322
01:26:47,223 --> 01:26:48,958

(SIGHS)

1324
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:03,309
Why the hell should we give that money back anyway, Frank?

1325
01:27:03,342 --> 01:27:06,279
We put our asses on the line every day for the department,

1326
01:27:06,312 --> 01:27:08,348
and the department pays us dick.

1327
01:27:08,382 --> 01:27:09,983
That's right, and in the end,

1328
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:12,486
the pension they hand us ain't worth shit.

1329
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:15,123
It'd keep my family on popcorn if I ever got clipped.

1330
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:19,527
Wait a minute, what am I talking about? I don't have a pension.

1331
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:21,730
God damn it, why do I keep sounding like a cop?

1332
01:27:21,764 --> 01:27:24,066
Because you are a cop.

1333
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:27,504
For years, I've been listening to you guys

1334
01:27:27,537 --> 01:27:29,406
talk about those assholes out there.

1335
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:32,710
Those lowlifes, those scumbags.

1336
01:27:32,743 --> 01:27:36,347
Well, if we take this money, this lousy drug money,

1337
01:27:37,683 --> 01:27:39,751
we're no better than they are.

1338
01:27:41,453 --> 01:27:42,788
Well?

1339
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:48,261
Are we gonna vote or anything?

1340
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:56,438
I guess not.

1341
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:02,044
Okay.

1342
01:28:02,078 --> 01:28:05,448
Well, if this is the right thing to do, how come I feel so shitty?

1343
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,723
JOE: They're off the force. They're no further threat to you.

01:28:12,756 --> 01:28:14,258
Look, why don't you let me handle it?

1345
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,961
Daly's my friend. I can deal with him, the son of a bitch.

1346
01:28:16,995 --> 01:28:19,130
I mean, he knows he fucked up when he took the money.

1347
01:28:19,163 --> 01:28:21,133
I want all the money back

1348
01:28:21,967 --> 01:28:23,769

(CHUCKLING) Come here. I want to show you this.

1371
01:29:48,768 --> 01:29:51,171
I thought instead of the walkie-talkies, we'd use this.

FRANK: Yeah? You know, this way, we'll be able to

1373
01:29:52,706 --> 01:29:55,442
keep our hands free for other purposes. Good thinking, Wayne.

No, but let's do it anyway.

01:31:59,721 --> 01:32:01,490
You bet your ass I'm ready, Frank.

01:32:13,938 --> 01:32:15,072

Come on, Frank, what's the point?

1390
01:33:32,129 --> 01:33:35,966
You people don't get shit from me until I see the man.

1391
01:33:37,902 --> 01:33:39,404
Look, Frank...

1392
01:33:44,343 --> 01:33:46,812
Okay, asshole, you'll meet the man.

1393
01:33:49,649 --> 01:33:51,018
Check him out.

1394
01:34:01,296 --> 01:34:02,631
