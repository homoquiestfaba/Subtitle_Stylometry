coming.

1411
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:04,309
We said, "let's, you know, get a
couple bottles of Tequila and

1412
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,435
have a hurricane party."

1413
01:24:05,485 --> 01:24:07,103
That's what we do in
Mississippi, you know.

1414
01:24:07,153 --> 01:24:08,320
I think that's what a lot of
people do.

1415
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:09,370
We were gonna have fun.

1416
01:24:09,675 --> 01:24:12,660
And then we were gonna go back
to work and do our thing.

1417
01:24:12,939 --> 01:24:13,939
It...

1418
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,820
It didn't happen that way.

1419
01:24:17,871 --> 01:24:20,019
I got a call from the
intergovernmental affairs office

1420
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:21,836
at the white house that said,

1421
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:28,660
"what's your opinion as to where you all
are from a vulnerability standpoint?"

1422
01:24:29,138 --> 01:24:31,686
And I said, "well, the best I
can tell you is that I believe

1423
01:24:31,736 --> 01:24:33,620
you can just write us off."

1424
01:24:33,671 --> 01:24:35,310
The house was shaking.

1425
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,686
The roof was tearing.

1426
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,061
And the house was taking on
water and no electricity.

1427
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,820
And I couldn't go anywhere,
because I was stuck.

1428
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:46,185
When I answered the
telephone and someone told me

1429
01:24:46,235 --> 01:24:49,936
they were on a roof, and they
were pregnant, and they had

1430
01:24:49,986 --> 01:24:52,936
children, and could I come get

1431
01:24:52,986 --> 01:24:54,300
them, could I help them?

1432
01:24:54,819 --> 01:24:58,686
It was just horrific. As a matter of fact,
after the storm, we had to go, you know,

1433
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:03,580
and offer assistance to the
dispatchers that took those 911 calls.

1434
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,268
Most hurricanes are 2, 2 1/2

1435
01:25:05,318 --> 01:25:06,686
hours, and they go on through.

1436
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:09,477
This one just stayed for nine to
ten hours.

1437
01:25:09,527 --> 01:25:11,610
And you couldn't tell when it
started, when it'd end, 'cause

1438
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,580
it was so long.

1439
01:25:12,631 --> 01:25:14,747
Honestly, I thought it was over.

1440
01:25:14,798 --> 01:25:15,900
I thought I was done.

1441
01:25:15,951 --> 01:25:19,460
I didn't know if my family was
alive, if I had a home anymore.

1442
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:21,860
And, you know, I got lucky.

1443
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,977
The house made it through.

1444
01:25:24,027 --> 01:25:26,536
The structure of the house made it through.
The house was destroyed.

1445
01:25:26,586 --> 01:25:28,220
The town was destroyed.

1446
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:29,602
We went from the 21st century

1447
01:25:29,652 --> 01:25:31,780
to the 18th century in nine
hours that day.

1448
01:25:31,831 --> 01:25:34,140
That's how much devastation we
had.

1449
01:25:34,322 --> 01:25:39,103
I had seen so many "after the
hurricane" walks that I thought

1450
01:25:39,153 --> 01:25:40,686
I knew what I would expect.

1451
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,811
Typically, the trees are
stripped of all the leaves, and

1452
01:25:43,861 --> 01:25:46,893
there's, you know, debris and
shingles and stuff, like, everywhere.

1453
01:25:46,944 --> 01:25:49,260
So I said, "you know, that'll be
what we'll see."

1454
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:52,460
And it was just beyond that.

1455
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:57,340
We have a duty to protect our
citizens, the people in our community.

1456
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:01,820
And when we do that, we put our
lives on the line.

1457
01:26:02,153 --> 01:26:05,380
But we try to make our families
safe before we do it.

1458
01:26:05,431 --> 01:26:08,340
All of the funeral homes were
destroyed.

1459
01:26:08,652 --> 01:26:11,880
And there was no water.
So we would pack bodies in body

1460
01:26:11,931 --> 01:26:16,019
bags and then put them in
refrigerator trucks till there

1461
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,700
would be a funeral.

1462
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:20,466
And I asked him about my family.

1463
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:21,966
And he said, "I don't know.

1464
01:26:22,017 --> 01:26:23,177
We haven't heard from them."

1465
01:26:23,228 --> 01:26:24,804
A lot of people died.

1466
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:27,300
A lot of people were hurt.

1467
01:26:27,499 --> 01:26:29,241
A lot of people lost everything.

1468
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:31,060
It was terrible.

1469
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,185
But it was also the kind of
thing that, as a community, we

1470
01:26:35,235 --> 01:26:37,380
said, "you know, we're gonna
survive this.

1471
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:39,540
If it doesn't kill us, we are
going to survive."

1472
01:26:40,073 --> 01:26:41,940
He told me to turn around.

1473
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,221
And I looked at him kind of funny,
like, "what are you talking about?"

1474
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:53,560
And he said, "turn around."
And when I did, my wife and

1475
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:57,780
daughter and her boyfriend were
walking across the street.

1476
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:03,540
And then I knew everything was
gonna be okay at that point.
