1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,044
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:07,771
<i>in a magical land...</i>

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,060
<i>An evil queen...</i>

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,828
I will not let them defeat me.

5
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:15,264
<i>Unleashed a powerful curse.</i>

6
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:21,208
The curse! It's here!

7
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:25,145
<i>And banished</i>
<i>every fairy tale character...</i>

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,349
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere horrible.

9
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:31,018
<i>To a place without magic.</i>

10
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:34,922
Welcome to Storybrooke.

11
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,071
They don't remember who they are.

12
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:38,195
<i>And for 28 years...</i>

13
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,463
Do you know this man?

14
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,665
<i>Their lives and memories</i>

15
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:43,267
<i>were stolen.</i>

16
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,535
No. Why? Who is he?

17
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:45,702
<i>Until...</i>

18
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:47,204
What's her name?

19
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:49,873
Her name is Emma.

20
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,408
<i>The one person who could save them...</i>

21
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:53,610
Are you Emma Swan? I'm her son.

22
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,612
<i>Came back into their lives.</i>

23
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:56,814
Do you believe <i>now?</i>

24
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,049
<i>And broke the spell.</i>

25
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:04,655
<i>Now...</i>

26
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,874
- Snow!
- Charming.

27
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:08,408
<i>Their memories have awakened...</i>

28
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,877
What do you want?

29
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,562
<i>And magic has returned.</i>

30
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:14,164
Magic? In Storybrooke?

31
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,082
You stay back!

32
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,717
- <i>And with it...</i>
- Aah!

33
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,286
- <i>Comes a price...</i>
- You're not gonna believe what I saw.

34
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:20,453
- <i>That everyone...</i>
- That boy...

35
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:23,173
- <i>Must pay.</i>
- is more than he appears.

36
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,427
No!

37
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,430
And that is how magic is made.

00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:38,638
<i>Until just recently,</i>

41
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:42,359
<i>Storybrooke, Maine, was</i>
<i>a quiet, out-of-the-way place.</i>

42
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,946
<i>To shed light on the notable</i>
<i>events in this tiny town,</i>

43
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,148
<i>we turn to "Once Upon A Time" creators</i>

44
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,483
<i>Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz.</i>

45
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,619
Well, Storybrooke is a town
that, in many ways,

46
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,322
is... is kind of lost in time.

47
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:59,259
The curse was enacted 28 years
ago in 1983.

48
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:01,261
The town itself is sort of timeless,

49
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:05,015
which you'll see with
the rotary phones and the cars.

50
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,551
This town was created
with all these characters

51
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:10,521
from all these fairy tales
who don't know who they are.

52
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:14,213
So you have Jiminy Cricket
is now Dr. Hopper.

53
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:16,381
And Granny runs the diner with Ruby,

54
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:18,383
who is, of course,
Little Red Riding Hood.

55
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:20,636
Oh!

56
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:23,317
Mayor Mills, I am so sorry.

57
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,636
<i>The town's mayor is Regina Mills,</i>

58
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,455
<i>the Evil Queen who enacted the curse</i>

59
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,191
<i>that brought them all to Storybrooke.</i>

60
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:33,294
<i>Regina's son Henry has not</i>
<i>always seen eye to eye</i>

61
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,528
<i>with his mother.</i>

62
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:35,546
Where have you been?

63
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,248
I found my <i>real</i> mom.

64
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,600
<i>And when Henry's</i>
<i>biological mother Emma Swan</i>

65
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,068
<i>entered their lives,</i>

66
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:44,205
<i>Regina tried everything</i>
<i>she could to eliminate her.</i>

67
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,412
I do hope you like apples.

68
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:48,247
What happened at the end of season one

69
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:50,283
was Henry accidentally ate

70
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,469
an apple turnover that had
a sleeping curse in it...

71
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,154
I love you, Henry.

72
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:58,204
And Emma, with true love's kiss,

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,591
awoke Henry and actually
broke the curse.

74
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:06,112
Oh! I love you, too.

75
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,401
<i>In that moment,</i>

76
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:13,203
<i>the residents of Storybrooke</i>
<i>regained their memories...</i>

77
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:16,809
<i>But as they celebrated</i>
<i>a joyful reunion...</i>

78
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,162
- Snow?
- Oh!

79
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:22,999
<i>A powerful force was about</i>
<i>to descend upon the town.</i>

80
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,835
Mr. Gold, otherwise known
as Rumplestiltskin,

81
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,836
brought magic to this land.

82
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,155
Magic... is coming.

83
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:31,357
He has now changed
the playing field.

84
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:32,459
What is that?

85
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:35,128
Both good and bad
can wield magic,

86
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,130
and what is that gonna mean
for them in their lives?

87
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:39,516
Yeah, we know that magic
always comes with a price,

88
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,268
and a lot of this season
is about paying it.

89
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,031
The Dark One summons thee.

90
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,150
<i>And the first measure of payback came</i>

91
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:50,870
<i>when Mr. Gold brought a wraith</i>
<i>to Storybrooke.</i>

92
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,969
This creature marks its victims,

93
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,288
and does not stop
until it achieves its goal,

94
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,873
which is sucking
the very essence of its victim

95
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,716
out of them. It's a fairy
tale Terminator, really.

96
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,245
Yeah. But our heroes came up
with what they thought

97
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:06,732
was a clever plan,
to take the Mad Hatter's hat,

98
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,467
which can create portals between worlds,

99
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,068
and throw the wraith into it.

100
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:12,571
Aah! No!

101
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:14,439
No!

102
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:15,457
Uhh!

103
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,594
<i>The plan worked,</i>

104
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:18,895
<i>sending the wraith to another world.</i>

105
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:23,032
<i>But it dragged mother</i>
<i>and daughter along with it.</i>

106
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,534
Mulan, what is this?

107
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,669
That is what brought the wraith here.

108
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:29,593
We have to get back to them.

109
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,466
The Enchanted Forest is not
as you remember it.

110
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:32,794
Leaving is unwise.

111
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:35,546
A lot of times, we'll flashback
to these characters

112
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,849
and the lives they had before the curse.

113
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,517
But this year, we introduced

114
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:41,986
the Enchanted Forest in present day.

115
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,871
Or as we like to say,

116
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,090
a post-apocalyptic Enchanted Forest.

117
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,179
<i>Mary Margaret had returned home,</i>

118
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,048
<i>but the land she knew as Snow White</i>

119
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,250
<i>had dramatically changed.</i>

120
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,235
When the curse was enacted
in season one,

121
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,104
there was a small pocket
of Fairytale land

122
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:58,205
that was protected.

123
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,606
This corner of land
is untouched.

124
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,842
No one knows why.
But something saved us.

125
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,444
And within that small pocket,

126
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:05,679
there were characters
who were still existing...

127
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:07,548
among them, Captain Hook...

128
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:08,949
Mulan and Aurora...

129
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:10,117
Lancelot.

130
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:11,285
Lancelot? Really?

131
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,619
He's an old friend.

132
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:16,023
Well... a fake Lancelot.

133
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:17,805
Clever girl.

134
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,773
Where's Lancelot?

135
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,374
I killed him a <i>long</i> time ago.

136
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,722
<i>Regina's mother Cora</i>

137
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,158
<i>was among those who remained</i>
<i>in the Enchanted Forest.</i>

138
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,125
Uhh!

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,427
- Where is she?
- Gone.

140
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,330
So Emma, who is within hours
of becoming a believer,

141
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,600
finds herself
in an actual enchanted forest.

142
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:37,623
Do exactly as I say,
and you might survive.

143
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:39,191
Thanks for the pep talk,
but I think we're okay.

144
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:41,393
Have you ever seen an ogre?

145
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,828
Pretty sure I've dated a few.

146
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:46,472
What <i>is</i> the plan?
You haven't told me anything.

147
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:47,673
What's going on?

148
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,137
Emma is a character
who can handle herself.

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,195
You wanna see
where you're from, Emma?

150
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:53,415
We're going home.

151
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,670
So Emma gets
a little headstrong at first...

152
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:58,848
And is firing guns up into the air.

153
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:01,350
But she doesn't know... well,
you know what noise attracts?

154
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,100
- Ogres?
-  - Ogres.

155
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,502
Run!

156
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:06,830
And fighting ogres is not easy

157
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:09,099
and it's more helpful
when you have your mom with you.

158
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,636
Back away from my daughter!

159
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,108
For the first season,

160
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:19,710
Mary Margaret was a schoolteacher

161
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,045
who didn't have a lot of confidence.

162
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,455
And now Emma realizes
her mom is Snow White,

163
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:28,758
who can take care of herself
and knows how to kill an ogre.

164
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,393
When was the last time
you shot an arrow?

165
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,878
28 years ago.

166
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:33,192
I guess it's like riding a bike.

167
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:36,349
Emma goes from not believing
that any of this exists

168
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:38,701
to climbing a beanstalk
to find the last giant,

169
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:42,038
so that she can find a compass
to return home.

170
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,251
And she does it rather deftly, I think.

171
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,619
Is that it?

172
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:52,954
That's our home.

173
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:56,557
She also got to see where
she was from for the first time.

174
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:59,126
I recognize this from Henry's book.

175
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:01,495
She's been on her own forever,

176
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,663
and didn't think she had

177
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:04,165
any place that she was really from,

178
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,534
and now she's discovering
it's this magical land,

179
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:09,804
and she's going to see the castle

180
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:11,973
where she was supposed
to be raised as a princess.

181
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,374
I lived here?

182
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:16,177
I was going to teach you
how to walk in here.

183
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:19,247
It's this amazing mix
of emotions for Emma,

184
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,881
of seeing what could've been for her.

185
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,402
We never got to be a family.

186
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:27,039
We have a family... in Storybrooke.

187
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:28,875
And right now, they need us
to get back there.

188
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,116
<i>Their search for a way back home</i>

189
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,318
<i>led to Rumplestiltskin's prison cell.</i>

190
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,756
<i>But Cora was also trying</i>
<i>to get to Storybrooke.</i>

191
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,126
<i>- And the magic compass...</i>
- Ahh.

192
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,794
<i>Was her ticket.</i>

193
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:47,832
We'd love to stay, but Storybrooke awaits.

194
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,034
Where we going?

195
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,335
Lake Nostros.

196
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,872
Its waters hold the power
to restore what was once lost.

197
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,627
We'll be able to cross worlds.

198
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:09,364
<i>The Enchanted Forest</i>
<i>is but one of many realms.</i>

199
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:12,667
The stories that we know in our
world exist in different realms.

200
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:15,370
Some exist in the realm
we call Fairytale Land,

201
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:18,239
and some exist in the realm
we call Wonderland.

202
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,374
You wanna go in <i>there?</i>

203
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:20,976
There's another realm without color,

204
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,510
where we saw Frankenstein.

205
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,979
Good evening, doctor.

206
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,188
Rumple Von Stiltskin.

207
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:29,225
- A foreigner.
- What tipped you off? My rosy complexion?

208
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,779
Things that can get you between worlds

209
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,303
can work in many different ways.

210
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,045
There is the hat, like the Mad Hatter's.

211
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:35,682
Please stand back.

212
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:37,433
You can go through
the looking-glass

213
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,734
to get to Wonderland.

214
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,203
Who are you?

215
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:42,304
Then there are magic beans

216
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,705
that can take you
anywhere you wanna go...

217
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,036
Welcome aboard.

218
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,270
But those are a rare commodity

219
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,706
and they were thought to be extinct.

220
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:51,608
This bean, can this make a portal?

221
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:54,462
It was destroyed like the rest of them.

222
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:55,864
So there are many different ways
to travel.

223
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,933
Sparkly dirt. Wonderful.

224
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,468
Just the remains of a magical wardrobe.

225
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,345
You'll be able to see your daughter,

226
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:07,113
and I can skin myself a crocodile.

227
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,579
<i>Cora was a miller's daughter,</i>

228
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:13,747
<i>and as a young woman,</i>

229
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:16,617
<i>she and her father</i>
<i>barely made ends meet.</i>

230
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,051
<i>It was a difficult life.</i>

231
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,353
Aah!

232
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:21,722
You stupid, foolish girl!

233
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:22,823
What happened here?

234
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:25,025
Uh, the peasant fell...

235
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,126
as they do.

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,995
You shall receive no money
for the flour,

237
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,496
and you will apologize to Eva.

238
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,531
Apologize? The wench tripped <i>me.</i>

239
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:32,733
Curb your tongue.

240
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:36,236
Cora has never gotten over
the scars of her youth.

241
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:39,907
This woman tells me that she can
spin straw into gold.

242
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,246
Magic is about emotion.

243
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,848
<i>Cora found a mentor in Rumplestiltskin,</i>

244
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:49,985
<i>who taught her the ways of dark magic.</i>

245
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,486
What do you want to do to them?

246
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:53,061
Cora's obsessed with power.

247
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,830
She's obsessed with status.

248
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:58,066
I want to make them <i>bow.</i>

249
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:00,385
She's obsessed with winning
at all costs.

250
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,820
Look.

251
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:03,722
I did it.

252
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:06,091
Rumplestiltskin was the only man
Cora ever loved.

253
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,577
They were almost like soul mates.

254
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,945
The king humiliated me.

255
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:11,580
I want to kill him,

256
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,248
show him his heart

257
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:15,817
as I <i>crush</i> it.

258
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:20,624
I wanted a heart,
and a heart I shall have.

259
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:21,691
Uhh!

260
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:23,793
<i>Hearts are a commodity in some circles.</i>

261
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:27,664
When you rip a person's
heart out, you can control them.

262
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,496
Rise.

263
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:34,181
It becomes enchanted,
like a super heart.

264
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,596
It's perfect.

265
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:37,598
And it is, uh, able to be crushed

266
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:38,916
or is able to be controlled.

267
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:40,184
That the two of you could've

268
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,819
gotten the remains of the wardrobe.

269
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,934
Or store it in a vault for rainy day.

270
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:46,837
These are all hearts.

271
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,355
My mother was a collector.

272
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,401
And we see this season
that it's not an easy skill.

273
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,020
Take its heart.

274
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:55,822
Regina struggled with it at first.

275
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,538
She can't do it to a poor unicorn.

276
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,625
Oh!

277
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:00,169
And I had such high hopes.

278
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,045
Uhh!

279
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,505
You're not hurting the beast.

280
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:06,068
You're controlling it.

281
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,641
<i>But when young Cora</i>
<i>attempted to use this power</i>

282
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,960
<i>to exact her revenge on the king,</i>

283
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:12,753
<i>she came to a realization.</i>

284
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,422
Couldn't you take the king's heart?

285
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,457
I chose not to.

286
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,054
Whose heart is in the box?

287
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:20,722
Mine.

288
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:22,824
You told me not to let anything stop me

289
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:25,227
until they're on their knees.

290
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:28,563
My heart was stopping me.

291
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:29,998
When she ripped
her own heart out

292
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,666
to break up with Rumplestiltskin,

293
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,268
he never got over that.

294
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:34,536
You never loved me.

295
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,490
The fact that she took
her own heart out

296
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:38,306
made her heartless,
and that was what enabled her

297
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:40,247
to do all the cruel acts she did.

298
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:43,373
But if you ask her, she's doing
it for the right reasons.

299
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,942
Her name is Regina,

300
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:48,895
for one day she will be queen.

301
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,853
- She does love her daughter.
-  - Yes.

302
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:52,937
And she does want what's best for her.

303
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:57,208
It's just, Cora's idea of what's
best for her is probably not

304
00:11:57,243 --> 00:12:00,845
what any right-minded person's
idea would be.

305
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,063
You ride like a man.

306
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,787
Theirs was
a dysfunctional relationship.

307
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:07,356
Who's going to want to marry you
when you behave like a...

308
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,624
Commoner?

309
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:11,544
Cora wanted Regina, from birth,
to be queen...

310
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:12,645
Yeah.

311
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,097
And Regina didn't always want that.

312
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,599
She wanted love.

313
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,666
Let's go.

314
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:19,302
<i>And when Regina tried to run away</i>

315
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,070
<i>with the stable boy Daniel...</i>

316
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:22,672
Uhh!

317
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:23,952
Mother!

318
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,187
Aah!

319
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:28,640
<i>Cora eliminated</i>
<i>her daughter's true love.</i>

320
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,412
Which, unfortunately for Cora,

321
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:35,032
resulted in her being sent
to Wonderland.

322
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:38,536
<i>Years later, while planning the curse,</i>

323
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,137
<i>Regina wanted to ensure</i>

324
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:43,491
<i>her mother would not follow her</i>
<i>to the land without magic...</i>

325
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:45,793
It's now enchanted.

326
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:49,212
It will enable you to rip out her heart.

327
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:53,266
<i>So she sent Captain Hook</i>
<i>to Wonderland to kill Cora.</i>

328
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,120
What?

329
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:59,422
I'm the Queen of <i>Hearts.</i>

330
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:00,623
Do you really think I'd be so careless

331
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:03,276
as to keep my heart
where everyone else does?

332
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,710
- This...
- Aah!

333
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:06,396
- Uhh!
- is how it's done.

334
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:09,933
<i>But Cora and Hook found common ground,</i>

335
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,367
<i>and the two joined forces.</i>

336
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:14,351
When the curse was
enacted, it was Cora

337
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:17,270
who creates a shield that covers
a corner of Fairytale Land

338
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:20,106
where she and Hook can wait.

339
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:23,182
The curse won't
last forever. It <i>will</i> end.

340
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,117
And when it does,

341
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,736
Regina will truly have lost everything,

342
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:28,816
and then she'll need me.

343
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,686
<i>That's</i> when we'll go to this new land.

344
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,854
Cora knows to reunite with her daughter,

345
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:34,422
she's gotta get to Storybrooke.

346
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:37,792
When Emma and Mary Margaret find
their way into Fairytale Land,

347
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:41,102
Cora discovers the remnants
of the wardrobe

348
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,304
that sent Emma to our world
to begin with.

349
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,305
And that becomes the key to her plan

350
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,008
to find a way back
to our world and to Regina.

351
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:53,296
You're not going anywhere!
The portal's taking us home.

352
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:55,261
The compass, get it.

353
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:58,924
<i>Snow and Emma had escaped</i>
<i>from Rumplestiltskin's cell</i>

354
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,426
<i>and were determined to use Cora's portal</i>

355
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:03,662
<i>to get back to Storybrooke.</i>

356
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:06,098
Emma, run!

357
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,368
<i>But Cora had other plans.</i>

358
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:10,902
- Good-bye, Snow.
- No!

359
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,404
Emma!

360
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:16,475
Oh, you foolish girl! Love is weakness.

361
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:19,544
Cora represents
the darkness of magic.

362
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:21,054
Emma represents the light.

363
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:23,556
No. It's strength.

364
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,063
Within Emma <i>is</i> magic...

365
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:31,131
What was that?

366
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,645
And the ability to wield magic,

367
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,768
and that's not something
just anyone can do.

368
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:36,512
That...

369
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:39,014
is a great subject for discussion...

370
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:41,150
when we get home!

371
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:43,686
<i>But there was danger</i>

372
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,721
<i>at the other end of the portal</i>
<i>in Storybrooke,</i>

373
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,857
<i>and Henry looked to Regina for help.</i>

374
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:49,625
You said you wanted to change,

375
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,026
to be better.

376
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:52,161
This is how.

377
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,396
She was able
to absorb that magic

378
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:56,632
and diffuse it.

379
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:59,602
Yeah. She saved Snow White's life.

380
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,785
Mom?

381
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,353
Oh! Henry!

382
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,521
Mom!

383
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:07,056
Oh!

384
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,590
Regina every now and then
has her moment,

385
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,025
and that was one of them

386
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,629
where she did something selfless
and she did something brave

387
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,197
because she loved Henry.

388
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,398
Thank you.

389
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,499
You're welcome.

390
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,102
Even though we love
watching her be bad,

391
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,403
it's moments like that

392
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:24,073
that make you want her to find
her own happy ending.

393
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:26,676
We failed.

394
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:28,712
Really, Cora,

395
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,246
why do you still doubt me?

396
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,315
Fortunately for Cora,

397
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,869
Hook stole the desiccated bean
from the giant.

398
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:37,804
And through that, they were cunning enough

399
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,824
to get their way to Storybrooke.

400
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,092
There it is.

401
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:45,295
Storybrooke.

402
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,181
This, gentlemen, is our mission.

403
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:58,479
We must investigate the line.

404
00:15:58,513 --> 00:15:59,646
<i>After the curse was broken,</i>

405
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:02,332
<i>not all was perfect in Storybrooke.</i>

406
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,951
All magic comes with a price,

407
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:06,220
and the price for bringing it
is anyone who leaves Storybrooke

408
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:08,972
will revert back to their curse memory.

409
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:10,367
You know, what if we found a turtle

410
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,002
and sorta nudged it over first?

411
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,420
Oh, for the love of...

412
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:16,006
Uhh!

413
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,375
Terrible news! Terrible news!

414
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,963
For instance, Sneezy becomes
Mr. Clark, the pharmacist.

415
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,349
If you cross the border, you
lose your memory all over again.

416
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:29,353
So now Gold is faced
with a dilemma.

417
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,055
He wants to find his son,

418
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,274
but the moment he leaves town,
he won't know who he is.

419
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,809
Yeah, he won't remember what he
was looking for to begin with.

420
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,244
Milah!

421
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:41,191
<i>Long ago, in the Enchanted Forest,</i>

422
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,675
<i>Rumplestiltskin was branded a coward.</i>

423
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:44,860
Milah!

424
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:47,012
<i>He deserted his countrymen</i>
<i>on the battlefield</i>

425
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,664
<i>to be with his newborn son.</i>

426
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:50,766
- Milah!
- Rumple.

427
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,134
What's his name?

428
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,368
Baelfire.

429
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,737
A strong name!

430
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,473
Something he'll need,

431
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,842
if he's to live with the shame
of being your son.

432
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:02,227
<i>Rumple's actions strained his marriage.</i>

433
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,029
Milah, it's time to go.

434
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,130
Who's this?

435
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,598
Eh, it's just my husband.

436
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,550
Oh. Well, he's a tad taller
than you described.

437
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,454
When we first meet Captain Hook,
he's Killian Jones,

438
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,957
and he's just doing what pirates do,

439
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:16,692
which is carousing at bars

440
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:18,544
and, you know, taking what he wants.

441
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:20,422
I... I remember you.

442
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,890
It's always nice to make an impression.

443
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,548
Unfortunately for Rumplestiltskin,

444
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,950
he wants Rumple's wife.

445
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,811
You see, we have a son,
and he needs his mother.

446
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:31,213
You see, I have a ship
full of men who need...

447
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:32,715
companionship.

448
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:34,149
And Rumple is a broken man,

449
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,819
having lost his wife,
and now he's a single father.

450
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,110
Women do not like to be married
to <i>cowards.</i>

451
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,845
Please don't speak
to my boy like that.

452
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,214
<i>Afraid of losing his son as well,</i>

453
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,249
<i>Rumplestiltskin summoned The Dark One...</i>

454
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,900
<i>A master of dark magic.</i>

455
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,469
- Die!
- <i>But by killing him,</i>

456
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:55,138
<i>Rumple transformed</i>
<i>into The Dark One himself.</i>

457
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:58,108
But unfortunately,
Rumple became a little crazy

458
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:00,143
with the power of being The Dark One,

459
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:02,812
and his son tried to return him
to the father that he loved

460
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,715
and he knew before
he became The Dark One.

461
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:08,818
A magic bean... the very last one
that is known to our kind.

462
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:11,580
You follow wherever it leads you.

463
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:14,316
<i>Bae made a deal with his father</i>
<i>to begin a new life</i>

464
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:15,584
<i>in a land without magic.</i>

465
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:16,719
We have to go through!

466
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:18,053
No, no! I don't think I can!

467
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,890
You coward! Don't break our deal!

468
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:22,024
I have to!

469
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:23,092
Papa!

470
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:24,560
No!

471
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:28,024
Rumple is faced with
a choice between power and love.

472
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:29,392
He let his son go

473
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:32,695
because he couldn't give up
the powers of The Dark One.

474
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,515
But he missed his son

475
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,601
so much that he brought magic
to Storybrooke.

476
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,035
I did it.

477
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:41,536
You can cross the town line?

478
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,871
Indeed I can.

479
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,072
He discovered a way

480
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,574
by finding an item that was
really important to him.

481
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:51,479
This shawl is all I have left
of my Baelfire.

482
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:53,782
By enchanting that,
he would be able to leave

483
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,216
and retain his memories.

484
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:58,148
But then a complication comes into play

485
00:18:58,182 --> 00:18:59,850
when Hook arrives.

486
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:01,285
Well, my dear Cora,

487
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:04,154
it's time for me to skin my crocodile.

488
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:10,417
When Rumplestiltskin
has become The Dark One

489
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:13,220
and is on his quest to find his son,

490
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:16,223
he happens upon Killian Jones.

491
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:18,925
You! Even gutter rats have more
manners than you just displayed.

492
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,027
Uh, I'm... I'm so sorry, sir.

493
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,730
Ah. I was wrong. Not a rat at all.

494
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,031
More like a crocodile.

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,702
And Rumple now knows as The Dark One,

496
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:30,337
he's got the ability
to exact the vengeance

497
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,472
in a way that, for pre-Dark One,

498
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,808
Rumplestiltskin couldn't do it.

499
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:40,211
Do you know what it's like to
have your wife stolen from you?

500
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:43,037
It feels like having your heart
ripped from your chest.

501
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,264
Uhh!

502
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,690
Stop!

503
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,981
The unexpected surprise
is coming across Milah,

504
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:51,851
not as a prisoner
but as a willing companion

505
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:53,152
to Killian Jones.

506
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:55,455
Oh, I feel a proposal coming on.

507
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:58,149
The magic bean in exchange
for our lives.

508
00:19:58,183 --> 00:20:01,119
And once again,
Rumple is faced with a choice

509
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:02,520
between power and love.

510
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,389
He can let his wife and Captain Hook go

511
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,656
and sail off in the world,

512
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:08,292
and have a bean that will
reunite him with his son,

513
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,927
or he can exact revenge.

514
00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:13,030
And in true Rumple fashion,
he can't help himself.

515
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:15,083
Milah!

516
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:17,034
And he does it Rumple-style,

517
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:18,403
which is ripping out your heart

518
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:20,905
and squeezing it in front
of until you fall over dead,

519
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:23,441
while your loved one watches.

520
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,459
And then cutting their hand off.

521
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:26,744
Aah!

522
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:29,899
Aah!

523
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:34,120
Killing me is gonna take
a lot more than that, dearie.

524
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,755
I will find a way.

525
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:38,807
Well, good luck living long enough.

526
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,245
And that is how Captain Hook is born.

527
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:48,584
And he will do whatever it takes
and he will align himself

528
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:51,520
with whomever will get him
to Rumplestiltskin

529
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:54,173
so he can exact revenge.

530
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,557
<i>At the Storybrooke town line,</i>

531
00:20:55,591 --> 00:21:00,012
<i>Mr. Gold was ready</i>
<i>to put his potion to the test.</i>

532
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:06,039
Belle.

533
00:21:07,445 --> 00:21:09,463
It... it worked!

534
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:11,581
Now you can find your son.

535
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,417
Uhh!

536
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:15,886
I wouldn't count on it.

537
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,921
Belle?

538
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,089
Belle?!

539
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:21,758
Belle!

540
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:23,193
Who... who... who's Belle?

541
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:26,396
<i>Hook's attack had</i>
<i>robbed Belle of her memory.</i>

542
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,065
<i>But before Gold could strike back,</i>

543
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,150
<i>Storybrooke had an unexpected visitor.</i>

544
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:47,441
What's going on?

545
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:48,698
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
- Ow!

546
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,500
Over here!

547
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:53,699
<i>Suddenly, Storybrooke was exposed.</i>

548
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,651
- Do you know this guy?
-  - Never seen him before.

549
00:21:55,702 --> 00:21:58,103
Looks like the world
just came to Storybrooke.

550
00:21:58,138 --> 00:22:01,757
When the curse was broken
and magic was brought,

551
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,492
Storybrooke was suddenly visible.

552
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:05,161
Anyone could drive in.

553
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:07,780
Why are my instincts telling me
that's a bad thing?

554
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:09,588
'Cause you've seen "E. T." or "Splash"

555
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:11,438
or any other movie where
they find something magical

556
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:12,740
and study it to death.

557
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,508
Think what'd they do to a werewolf.

558
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:17,111
So, Mr. Mendell,

559
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:20,547
I do need you to state what you saw.

560
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:21,848
I didn't see anything.

561
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh.

562
00:22:23,316 --> 00:22:26,118
I looked down, just for a second,

563
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:28,749
and when I looked back up,
he was right there.

564
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,934
And he was too close to avoid.

565
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:33,632
In season one, we saw Emma
was able to come to Storybrooke.

566
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:35,910
We saw August was able
to come to Storybrooke.

567
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:38,880
But these were people who were
a part of Fairytale Land.

568
00:22:38,914 --> 00:22:40,915
- And born in the Enchanted Forest.
- Right.

569
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,021
Pinocchio, in 28 years,

570
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,375
you must make sure the savior believes.

571
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,564
<i>Pinocchio was charged</i>
<i>with great responsibility</i>

572
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:57,717
<i>when he and baby Emma journeyed</i>
<i>to a new world.</i>

573
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,603
<i>But not long after, they found</i>
<i>a home in an orphanage.</i>

574
00:23:00,637 --> 00:23:01,755
Shh. Shh.

575
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,307
<i>Pinocchio left Emma</i>
<i>to fend for herself...</i>

576
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,493
I told my father I'd take care of Emma.

577
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,942
We can't take care of a baby.

578
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:10,910
I'm sorry, Emma.

579
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,244
<i>And Emma grew up living a life of crime.</i>

580
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:20,049
We got to see what Emma was like
before Storybrooke...

581
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,250
a woman on her own.

582
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:22,618
Impressive.

583
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:26,289
But really, you could've just
asked me for the keys.

584
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,423
And that's when she meets Neal.

585
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,659
This isn't your car either, is it?

586
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,894
She's actually met a kindred spirit

587
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:33,746
because he's also stealing the car.

588
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:36,165
20 minutes till housekeeping.

589
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,300
What they knew at a young age was

590
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:39,735
the simple things were
the important things.

591
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,304
It's not much of a home.

592
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,838
Maybe it's time we get a real place.

593
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,107
- Being with each other...
- Yeah.

594
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:46,893
Being in love and finding
a place to be together.

595
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,807
Like where, Neverland?

596
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,108
I'm serious. We could do this.

597
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,810
They just wanted to live their lives

598
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:54,062
and they wanted to find a family
and they wanted to be together.

599
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:56,948
Are you sure? Is this what
you really want?

600
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,250
What I really want is you.

601
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,735
Emma was always
a character searching for home.

602
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,655
Unfortunately, destiny got
in the way of that.

603
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,271
<i>Emma and Neal planned to use</i>
<i>cash from stolen watches</i>

604
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:08,906
<i>to begin their life together.</i>

605
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:10,491
There's $20,000 easy.

606
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,176
$20,000?!

607
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:16,614
<i>But Neal was faced</i>
<i>with greater forces at work.</i>

608
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:19,533
Tragically, Emma's role as savior

609
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,302
and her place in this greater story

610
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,821
came into play and broke them apart.

611
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,973
She has a destiny,

612
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,988
and you're gonna keep her from it.

613
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:29,423
<i>Pinocchio had returned.</i>

614
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,004
<i>He had changed his name</i>
<i>to August Booth...</i>

615
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,472
When you see what I have in here,

616
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,574
you're gonna believe every word I say.

617
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:38,427
<i>And he knew Neal's true identity.</i>

618
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:41,630
I was tasked with keeping her on track,

619
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:45,417
and you just got caught
in the crossfire.

620
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:48,170
<i>Neal left Emma</i>
<i>to face prosecution alone,</i>

621
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:50,406
<i>placing her on</i>
<i>a challenging path to destiny.</i>

622
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,457
Let's go.

623
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,253
Emma already had her guard up,

624
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:56,289
and this was a time
where she let it down,

625
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:59,559
and she would never let it down
again except for Henry.

626
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,711
Please? I told you about your parents.

627
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,096
Family's important to the show

628
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,832
because it is something
that everybody needs

629
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:09,334
and it is something
that everybody looks for.

630
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,219
Your dad was training to be a fireman.

631
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:13,810
Did you get married?

632
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,612
Oh, no, nothing like that.

633
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:20,214
I was pregnant with you,
and I tried to contact him.

634
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:23,901
I found out that he died

635
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,804
saving a family from
a burning apartment building.

636
00:25:29,882 --> 00:25:31,482
I need to find someone,

637
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,527
so we're leaving today.

638
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:35,846
Find someone? Who?

639
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:36,914
My son.

640
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,885
<i>With the help of an enchanted globe,</i>

641
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:42,638
<i>Mr. Gold found Bae's location.</i>

642
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,923
<i>And with Henry and Emma,</i>

643
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:46,909
<i>he crossed the town line.</i>

644
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:51,113
<i>But that was only the first leg</i>
<i>of the journey.</i>

645
00:25:51,147 --> 00:25:54,583
Seeing Mr. Gold going through
a security line

646
00:25:54,617 --> 00:25:57,002
and getting on a plane,
which in a lot of ways

647
00:25:57,053 --> 00:25:59,471
is one of this world's
most magical things...

648
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:01,123
it's something that can fly
in the air...

649
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:02,651
It's gonna be all right.

650
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:04,987
He was venturing into a world
he had never known.

651
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,573
That was, for us,
the inspiration for that story.

652
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:09,604
Let me guess...
he's not expecting you.

653
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:11,947
Well, who doesn't love a surprise?

654
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:15,617
Emma and Gold and Henry make
their way to New York City...

655
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:17,669
He's running.

656
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:20,989
And they track down Baelfire.

657
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:25,127
Get him to talk to me. I... I can't run.

658
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,970
And it is a shock to Emma

659
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:34,722
to discover that Baelfire,
Rumplestiltskin's son,

660
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,041
is actually Neal...

661
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:37,860
- Neal?
- Emma?

662
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:40,596
The love of her life
from ten years earlier.

663
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,883
Now we have a very messy family reunion.

664
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:45,531
Bae.

665
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,650
Get out of my apartment!

666
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:47,867
- Neal...
- Emma, I got this.

667
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,457
You two know each other how?

668
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,726
Mom, what's going on?

669
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,395
Whoa. Who's this?

670
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,179
- My son.
- What?

671
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,381
Is that Baelfire?

672
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,316
And now Neal discovering

673
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,602
that not only did he break Emma's heart,

674
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:04,087
but he left behind a son...

675
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,806
Is this my son?

676
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,942
Mom?

677
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,761
A son who's completely confused

678
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,347
because he's been lied to by his mother.

679
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,598
Yes.

680
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:20,441
Rumplestiltskin
is Henry's grandfather?

681
00:27:20,492 --> 00:27:21,875
Apparently.

682
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,146
So his... stepgrandmother is Regina?

683
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:27,498
Yeah, I think Charming summed it up

684
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:30,718
when he said Thanksgivings
would suck at that house.

685
00:27:30,912 --> 00:27:33,246
So you're really from... there?

686
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:34,414
Yeah, I am.

687
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,106
<i>As Henry got to know his father,</i>

688
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:40,994
<i>Gold pressed Emma to help</i>
<i>smooth things over with Neal.</i>

689
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:42,579
So, uh, you talk to him?

690
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:43,997
It's complicated.

691
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:45,632
Oh, I see.

692
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,634
Maybe he just needs some time.
I don't know.

693
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,335
Uhh! Aah!

694
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:51,221
<i>But there was a bigger problem.</i>

695
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:54,424
Uhh! Aah! Oh!

696
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,559
Time's up, crocodile.

697
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:57,760
Aah!

698
00:27:57,794 --> 00:27:59,395
Uhh!

699
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:02,599
Gold, are you all right?

700
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:13,732
<i>After the curse was finally</i>
<i>broken in Storybrooke...</i>

701
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,108
Johanna?

702
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:17,461
<i>Long-lost friends found</i>
<i>one another again.</i>

703
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,495
Snow.

704
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,347
Oh! Oh, ho ho!

705
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:23,199
Snow.

706
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,161
Mother.

707
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,468
<i>When Snow White was a young girl...</i>

708
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:30,088
<i>Her mother, Queen Eva, fell deathly ill.</i>

709
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,940
<i>Johanna was a royal servant...</i>

710
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:33,658
Is she going to die?

711
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:36,194
<i>And she cared for Snow</i>
<i>during this difficult time.</i>

712
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,482
I don't want to lose her.

713
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:43,338
Snow White was trying to save
her mother's life,

714
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:45,491
and Cora, pretending to be
the Blue Fairy,

715
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,126
offered her a candle.

716
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:49,590
This candle can
save your mother's life.

717
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:51,808
But all magic comes with a price.

718
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:53,844
And the price would be
another person's life.

719
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:57,814
You most hold this candle over
the heart of your sacrifice.

720
00:28:57,832 --> 00:29:00,050
<i>Snow was unwilling to sacrifice a life,</i>

721
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:03,020
<i>even to save her own mother,</i>

722
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:04,321
<i>and Eva died.</i>

723
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:09,193
<i>Cora's manipulation of young Snow</i>

724
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,028
<i>was just the beginning.</i>

725
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:13,030
Snow would've been a great ruler
someday,

726
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:14,131
but that'll never happen

727
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:15,899
because my daughter will be queen.

728
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:20,970
<i>Regina did become the queen...</i>

729
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,516
Uhh!

730
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,884
<i>And she spent much of her reign</i>

731
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,605
<i>at war with Snow White</i>
<i>and Prince Charming.</i>

732
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:29,206
Leaving the battle so soon?

733
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:31,358
The battle's over, Regina.

734
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:34,995
I offer to negotiate the terms
of your surrender.

735
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,413
My terms are quite simple...

736
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:37,531
your death.

737
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:38,682
Now!

738
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:45,144
You should have surrendered
when I gave you the chance.

739
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,432
The tragedy, I think,
between the two of them is,

740
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:50,752
Snow White as a young girl
always looked up to Regina.

741
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:53,238
She saved her life, and she's
always hoping she returns

742
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:56,941
to the person she met when she
was in love with the stable boy.

743
00:29:57,613 --> 00:30:01,179
<i>The queen faced execution,</i>
<i>but Snow showed mercy.</i>

744
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,715
This is a chance to start fresh, Regina,

745
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:07,018
to leave the evil behind in this cell.

746
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,769
Just like that?

747
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,221
Just like that.

748
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,267
There's so much
bitterness and anger,

749
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,143
almost like a blood feud between them

750
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:16,595
that we wonder, how will
they ever work it out?

751
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:20,616
You make change sound so easy.

752
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:23,102
Every time she starts to redeem herself,

753
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:24,861
something seems to get in the way.

754
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:27,771
<i>In Storybrooke,</i>
<i>Regina wanted nothing more</i>

755
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:30,307
<i>than to earn Henry's love...</i>

756
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:32,726
<i>But it would be more difficult</i>
<i>than it seemed.</i>

757
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:36,930
Mother.

758
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:38,782
Cora gets to Storybrooke
and realizes that

759
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:43,970
to get Regina to forgive her
for oh, so many transgressions,

760
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:46,306
she's got to have her daughter need her.

761
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,475
I want my daughter back.

762
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:50,226
Let me into your heart.

763
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:53,063
Regina really does want
her mother's love and approval.

764
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:56,492
But more importantly,
I think Regina wants Henry.

765
00:30:56,527 --> 00:30:58,928
Together, we can get him back again.

766
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:03,499
And she feels like,
redeeming myself and being good

767
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,617
is taking too long,

768
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:06,602
and my mom's offering me a shortcut.

769
00:31:06,637 --> 00:31:08,304
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

770
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:12,127
If we possess the dagger,
we control The Dark One.

771
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,837
I'll use that dagger
to force The Dark One

772
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:16,707
to kill anyone you like.

773
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:20,461
<i>Cora's plan would leave Regina</i>
<i>blameless in Henry's eyes,</i>

774
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,163
<i>but David and Mary Margaret</i>

775
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:23,948
<i>were not about to let that happen.</i>

776
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:25,379
We did it.

777
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:27,114
The Dark One finally can be controlled.

778
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:28,666
Indeed he can be.

779
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,301
But by whom?

780
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:34,422
What Cora's looking for is
to become The Dark One herself.

781
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:35,665
Johanna!

782
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,533
- Uhh!
- Aah!

783
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:40,553
Your choice.

784
00:31:40,604 --> 00:31:41,821
Aah! Uhh!

785
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,207
The dagger, dear.

786
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:45,892
Enough!

787
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:49,912
You have what you came for.

788
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,447
Not quite everything.

789
00:31:51,482 --> 00:31:53,149
Aah! Aah!

790
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:58,102
In that moment,
Mary Margaret kind of snapped...

791
00:31:58,136 --> 00:31:59,920
You see where good gets you?

792
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:02,740
And she started to say,

793
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:05,637
had I got rid of Regina years ago,

794
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:07,437
I would have seen my daughter grow up,

795
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:09,489
and none of this would've happened.

796
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:10,791
She needs to be killed.

797
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:12,744
This is our family.
We are going to protect it.

798
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,401
Of course we will,

799
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:16,086
but not by your hand
and not out of vengeance.

800
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:19,523
Why? Because you wouldn't be
able to live with yourself.

801
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:22,569
We gotta get him to an E.R. fast.

802
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:25,902
<i>In New York,</i>
<i>Mr. Gold's injury was serious.</i>

803
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:27,637
There's gotta be some way
we can save you.

804
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:28,688
There is. There is.

805
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:30,856
Storybrooke. There's magic there now.

806
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,727
<i>Captain Hook's ship</i>
<i>provided quick passage,</i>

807
00:32:34,762 --> 00:32:37,580
<i>and Gold made it back to Storybrooke.</i>

808
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:38,831
My cabinet.

809
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:41,301
<i>And while Cora had possession</i>
<i>of the dagger,</i>

810
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,836
<i>he had his own powerful weapon.</i>

811
00:32:43,871 --> 00:32:47,040
The candle can save me.
There's nothing else.

812
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:50,760
I wouldn't use this
to save my own mother.

813
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,535
What makes you think
I would use it for you?

814
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:56,788
For once, our interests are aligned.

815
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:58,540
Snow White started to wonder,

816
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,525
what did being good ever get me?

817
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,477
Maybe the path, uh, I've been on

818
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:04,296
is only causing more heartache.

819
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:08,710
And in a moment of weakness
and in a moment of anger...

820
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:10,579
Cora.

821
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,046
<i>- Cora.</i>
- She lit the candle

822
00:33:12,064 --> 00:33:14,315
and she gave that heart back to Regina.

823
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,819
She can't love you, you know.
She doesn't have her heart.

824
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:21,056
With it, maybe she can.

825
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:34,031
<i>For a brief moment, Cora felt the love</i>

826
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:36,934
<i>she had denied herself</i>
<i>for so many years.</i>

827
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:38,519
Mother.

828
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:43,584
<i>But the feeling wouldn't last.</i>

829
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,342
Mother?
Oh!

830
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:47,111
M... mother?

831
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:48,746
Oh.

832
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,065
This...

833
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:53,534
would've been enough.

834
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,377
Mother?

835
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:00,145
What am I gonna do?

836
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:06,205
You did this.

837
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,579
Hey. They said I'm good to go,

838
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:20,243
but, you know, I think I'm gonna
stay here for a little while.

839
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,214
Why?

840
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,397
Well, take a look at this and see.

841
00:34:24,432 --> 00:34:27,651
<i>The outsider in Storybrooke</i>
<i>had reason to stay.</i>

842
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:29,252
Greg actually witnessed magic

843
00:34:29,286 --> 00:34:30,570
and he is fascinated by this magic,

844
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:33,740
and he is staying around town
to document it.

845
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:37,627
Why he's there and what his
connection to Storybrooke is

846
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,878
is explained when we take a look back

847
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:41,081
at the, uh, the first day of the curse.

848
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,867
Now pull the loops as tight as you can.

849
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:46,703
Mm. Ah, look at that!

850
00:34:46,947 --> 00:34:49,282
When Regina first cast the curse,

851
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:53,336
Storybrooke landed in the middle
of the forest in Maine,

852
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:57,907
right by a campsite
of a father and a son.

853
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,153
This is impossible.

854
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:04,291
It's like someone dropped a town
right on top of us.

855
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:07,194
<i>Storybrooke's unexpected</i>
<i>visitors soon met the mayor.</i>

856
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:09,496
- You're in my seat.
- But I'm already sitting here.

857
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:13,619
<i>And for Regina, new faces</i>
<i>would be a welcome change.</i>

858
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,822
Revenge is somewhat hollow.

859
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,290
Regina at first loves it.

860
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:19,958
Beautiful day, isn't it?

861
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,643
Yes, it is.

862
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:24,219
She enjoys seeing
Snow White miserable,

863
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,671
and she enjoys seeing
Prince Charming in a coma.

864
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:28,456
But after a while, it grows old.

865
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,675
- Morning, Madam Mayor.
- Save it.

866
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:33,778
Everyone is telling her
exactly what she wants to hear.

867
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:35,274
And she gets bored.

868
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:37,760
And the first person
to say something different

869
00:35:37,794 --> 00:35:38,978
is this child.

870
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:40,379
What's this?

871
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:42,815
It's a gift for letting me sit
in your seat.

872
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,900
And that's what
she realizes she needs.

873
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:47,653
The way to fill the void in
her heart from casting the curse

874
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,238
is through a son.

875
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:50,656
The father doesn't wanna be there.

876
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,275
He just wants to take the boy
and go back home to New Jersey.

877
00:35:53,782 --> 00:35:56,317
And ultimately, Regina won't
allow that to happen.

878
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:59,966
Sheriff, our visitors
are driving out of Storybrooke.

879
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:02,496
Find them before
they cross the town line.

880
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:06,367
<i>But the boy's father knew</i>
<i>something was wrong.</i>

881
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:09,437
Run into the woods.
Get as far away as you can. Run!

882
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:13,591
- Dad!
- Run!

883
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,892
Why are you doing this?

884
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:16,694
You wanna stay here, don't you?

885
00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:18,479
Not like this.

886
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:21,026
What Regina realizes
is that if she forces this kid

887
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,205
to live with her, it won't be real,

888
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,900
and that was the whole purpose
of finding a son to begin with.

889
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,657
I'm sorry.

890
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:30,126
I just wanted us to be happy.

891
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,479
And then that boy grows up
to be Greg Mendell...

892
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:34,680
Who has been
searching for this town

893
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:36,132
for a very long time.

894
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,150
You could've told me who
you were and why you're here.

895
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:40,403
I... I think you know why I'm here.

896
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:41,477
I'm looking for my father.

897
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:43,673
Your father?

898
00:36:43,707 --> 00:36:45,591
He left shortly after you did.

899
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,188
I never saw him again.

900
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,511
<i>After finding Neal in New York...</i>

901
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,827
Thank God I caught you.

902
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,112
What are you doing here?
Oh!

903
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,613
<i>Emma received some surprising news.</i>

904
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:56,498
- I'm Tamara.
- Emma.

905
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:57,933
She's my fiancee.

906
00:36:59,736 --> 00:37:01,854
So how'd you guys meet?

907
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,355
For Emma, this is hard.

908
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,909
It's been ten years, and she's
moved on from Neal, but...

909
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:10,209
- Mm-hmm.
- Moving on and seeing someone else move on

910
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,527
are two different things.

911
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:14,413
And when she sees that Neal is
with someone else,

912
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:15,664
she is upset,

913
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:18,066
but in true Emma fashion,
won't admit it.

914
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:21,972
Does she know who you really are
and where you're really from?

915
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:24,573
Take my advice. Tell her the truth.

916
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:27,059
Neal comes clean with Tamara,

917
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,454
and says, "I'm from
the Enchanted Forest."

918
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:31,924
"My father's Rumplestiltskin,
and you're in Crazytown."

919
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,842
What the hell are you doing?

920
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,377
I'm trying to be honest with you.

921
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,063
What we learn is,

922
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:40,482
Tamara isn't everything
she's presented to Neal,

923
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:44,362
and that she is someone
who not only believes in magic,

924
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:47,632
knows about it,
has sought it out in the past.

925
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,690
<i>After steering Neal away from Emma,</i>

926
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:54,349
<i>August spent the next ten years</i>
<i>indulging himself</i>

927
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:56,560
<i>and neglecting his responsibilities.</i>

928
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:58,127
8:15...

929
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:00,412
when Emma came to Storybrooke
and that clock moved.

930
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,981
He felt it a world away in Phuket.

931
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,450
And he started to turn to wood,

932
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:07,820
because it was a reminder
that he failed at his mission

933
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:09,861
and that he has failed as a person.

934
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,989
The Blue Fairy told him to be
selfless, brave, and true,

935
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,657
and he was anything but that.

936
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:17,713
You're turning to wood...

937
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:19,398
Pinocchio.

938
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:23,185
August heard of a man
who went by "The Dragon,"

939
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:25,471
who supposedly could cure any ailment.

940
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,056
$10,000 American dollars,

941
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,825
and you shall <i>never</i> turn to wood again.

942
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:33,574
<i>It was then that August met Tamara,</i>

943
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,540
<i>who also sought The Dragon.</i>

944
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:36,892
So what brought you to him?

945
00:38:36,943 --> 00:38:38,343
Cancer.

946
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:40,411
A very rare form.

947
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:41,730
Oh.

948
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:43,634
Sorry. I'll be right back.
Will you watch this?

949
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,438
Yeah.

950
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:45,542
He was so desperate

951
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,311
that he was
willing to steal from somebody

952
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:50,747
who he thought at the time had cancer

953
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,649
to get what he wanted.

954
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:55,002
Stop! That's mine.

955
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,988
I'm so sorry.

956
00:38:58,022 --> 00:38:59,089
Hey!

957
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:00,674
Uhh!

958
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:06,880
Whatever it is you have...
You deserve your fate.

959
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,923
<i>In truth, Tamara had no need</i>
<i>for the potion,</i>

960
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:12,074
<i>but still, she was eager to possess it.</i>

961
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:13,826
She is not sick.

962
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,295
She is actually after
the magical abilities

963
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:18,764
this man has. Now that I have it,

964
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:21,996
I can't risk anyone else finding you.

965
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:36,800
And then we realize for reasons
that have yet to be explored,

966
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,253
Tamara is really, really
interested in the magic

967
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,372
that's going on in Storybrooke.

968
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,142
Anyone in here?

969
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:46,527
<i>With no cure for his condition...</i>

970
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:48,546
Just me.

971
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,165
<i>August retreated to Storybrooke</i>
<i>and went into hiding.</i>

972
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,250
August?

973
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,305
August feels like he wasted his life.

974
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,057
This is my own punishment.
I did this to myself.

975
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:01,242
August, I'm so sorry.

976
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:04,161
I know. But you don't have to hide.

977
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,864
There are people in Storybrooke
who care about you.

978
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:09,296
But maybe some things
you just don't come back from.

979
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,684
<i>The last person August expected</i>
<i>to see was Tamara.</i>

980
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:16,864
Long time.

981
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:18,818
<i>And when he learned of her plan,</i>

982
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:20,720
<i>he was given an opportunity for redemption.</i>

983
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,888
Emma, it's August.

984
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,150
- August.
- Listen to me.

985
00:40:24,184 --> 00:40:25,252
I have to warn you.

986
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,420
August?

987
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:28,922
I know what you did to The Dragon,

988
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:31,925
and you are not going to
harm anyone here.

989
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,176
I'm going to warn them.

990
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,295
No, you're not.

991
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,305
August makes the right choice,

992
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,988
and he finally is selfless,
brave, and truthful.

993
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,609
- August!
- He warns Emma and everybody at the risk

994
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:50,245
of his own life, and because of that,

995
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,130
he gets a second chance
at his life again.

996
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:55,300
- Father?
- Pinocchio.

997
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:58,353
I'm a real boy. I'm a real boy!

998
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:01,323
The Blue Fairy gives him
what he's earned,

999
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:02,524
which is another go.

1000
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:04,272
Do better this time, Pinocchio.

1001
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,656
These characters all seem
to be connected by love.

1002
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:10,075
The search for love, the loss of love,

1003
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,343
the restoration of love.

1004
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:14,446
Each character, you realize,
is looking for

1005
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:16,348
their own happy ending.

1006
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:17,566
<i>Magic...</i>

1007
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:20,396
<i>Both light...</i>

1008
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,554
<i>And dark...</i>

1009
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:26,128
<i>Is a powerful force.</i>

1010
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:29,793
<i>And it's finally arrived...</i>

1011
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,412
<i>In Storybrooke, Maine.</i>

1012
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:35,498
<i>But for those who
dare to harness its power...</i>

1013
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:37,801
Hey, why haven't you called
me back? Where are you?

1014
00:41:39,337 --> 00:41:40,887
<i>Be careful,</i>

1015
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:43,790
<i>for magic always comes...</i>

1016
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:46,009
- Right here.
<i>- With a price.</i>

1017
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:48,294
Sorry I'm late.
It's been a heck of a day.
