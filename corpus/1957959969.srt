1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,951
(mysterious music)

2
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,904
(solemn music)

3
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:50,647
(tense music)

4
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:44,161
(man grunts)

5
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,903
- Nice try, David.

6
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,307
Isn't it interesting how far
a man can run on desperation?

7
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,543
David David, David.

8
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,738
Where are the negatives?

9
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,239
(tense music)

10
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,583
Where are the negatives?

11
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,253
- Fuck you.

12
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,053
Fuck all of you!

13
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,033
- It's no matter.

14
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,093
We'll find them intact.

15
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,007
It's too bad they won't
find you in that condition.

16
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:51,074
(tense music)

17
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:04,655
(heartbeat thumping)

18
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:10,257
(tense music)

19
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:11,923
- No, no!

20
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,116
No!
(heartbeat thumping rapidly)

21
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,681
No!

22
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:17,432
(David shouting)

23
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:21,262
(mysterious music)

24
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:28,225
(birds chirping)

25
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,549
- Can I help you?

26
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,249
- I'm here about the
job, the secretary's job?

27
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,049
- You are in the right place.

28
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,399
I'm Paul Henson, the new editor

29
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,850
of "The Copperton Chronicle."

30
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,809
Well, can you type?

31
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,519
- 80 words a minute.

32
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,049
- Good, good.

33
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,300
Can you answer the phone?

34
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,069
Then you're hired.

35
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,923
How about helping me with these boxes?

36
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,406
- Daddy, aren't you gonna introduce us?

37
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:21,029
- I'm sorry, this is
my daughter, Christine,

38
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,219
she's helping me sort things
out here in the office.

39
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,589
Just got back from Florida, but soon

40
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,329
she'll be back in school.

41
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,699
And your name is?
- Evelyn.

42
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,723
Evelyn Spyker.

43
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,693
- Well, Evelyn, welcome aboard.

44
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,509
- Excuse me.

45
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,519
I'm looking for a Paul Henson.

46
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,353
- You got him.

47
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,059
What can I do for you?

48
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,379
- Hi, I'm Shannon Cornell.

49
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,449
I'm here about the reporting position.

50
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,739
- Yeah, I just didn't
expect anybody this quick.

51
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,869
I mean, this is such a small town and all.

52
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,889
- Well, I need a break.

53
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,449
I've been working as a staff reporter

54
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,829
for "The New York Times" for a while,

55
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,439
and I just feel I need to get away.

56
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,019
- Yeah, I know what you mean,
I just bought this paper

57
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,619
last month, after 15 years
at "The Chicago Tribune."

58
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,609
City can be a real pain
in the ass after a while.

59
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,649
This is my daughter, Christine.

60
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,943
- Hi.
- Hi.

61
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,359
- So you need a job,
and I need a reporter.

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,309
So, I guess you're hired.

63
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,519
I remember back in Chicago when I wa...

64
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,373
Excuse me.

65
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,887
Sheriff, Sheriff!

66
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,787
Hey.

67
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:37,063
Hey, Sheriff!

68
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:37,897
Sheriff!

69
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,013
Hey, Sheriff, got any news for us?

70
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,289
Come on, Sheriff, god dammit.

71
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,399
It's the right of the people to know

72
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,576
what's going on in the town
they live in, don't you think?

73
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:49,739
- And is it their right to
harass the process of the law?

74
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,869
- Hey, who's harassing who here, Sheriff?

75
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,489
- You news people are
all the same, aren't you?

76
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,909
Think you can just walk all
over people to get a scoop.

77
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,338
Damn blood suckers.

78
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:02,939
(people chattering on police radio)

79
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,133
Kid found a body out by the Bailey place.

80
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,463
Guy's been dead a couple hours.

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,660
I'm heading out there now.

82
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,080
Find your own damn ride.

83
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,249
- And how long you been standing there?

84
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,200
- Long enough to say, "let's go, boss."

85
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:29,051
(camera clicks)

86
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:33,473
(bird cawing)

87
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,199
- Jesus.

88
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,300
What coulda done this?

89
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,489
- Every so often, some damn smugglers

90
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,063
get a little too careless
with their bosses and slip up.

91
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,473
- You don't think this
is drug related, do you?

92
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,008
- It's drug related.

93
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,283
- Shannon.

94
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,079
You wanna take a look at this?

95
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,759
Hey, it's okay.

96
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,099
He's a John Doe.

97
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,939
If they don't even know who he is.

98
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,773
- It's nothing.

99
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,090
(siren trills)

100
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,591
(tense music)

101
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,041
- Hey.

102
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:32,731
God.

103
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,232
(tense music)

104
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,299
- Paul, I've done a
lot of drug follow-ups,

105
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,269
and this doesn't look like
anything on that order.

106
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,129
Take a look at the marks on the leg.

107
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,389
The entry point.

108
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,979
That's not even torture.

109
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,839
It's more like...

110
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,983
God, I don't know.

111
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,773
- Got a hunch, don't ya?

112
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,989
- It's a long shot.

113
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,340
But I need to check it out.

114
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,333
- Sheriff says it's an open and shut case.

115
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,449
All right.

116
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,283
Go for it.

117
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,040
- Oh, I didn't know you were here.

118
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,823
There you are.
- Thanks.

119
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:19,344
(door opens and closes)

120
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:30,923
(shop bell rings)
(solemn music)

121
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,529
- Hi.

122
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,019
- Finish creating the
office yet, Mr. Henson?

123
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,839
- Well, it's proven to be a
little harder than it looks.

124
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,360
You know, we had to chase
the rats away first.

125
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,519
- Oh my.

126
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,629
- I'm just kidding.

127
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm just kidding.

128
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:06,359
(shop bell rings)

129
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,889
- Reverend Donovan.

130
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,063
- Hello, Beatrice.

131
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,609
Hello.

132
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,073
You must be Mr. Henson,
our new newspaper editor.

133
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,249
I'm Reverend Donovan.

134
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,000
I've looked forward to meeting you.

135
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,999
Certainly will be nice to
have our own newspaper now,

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,679
won't it, Beatrice?

137
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,643
- Yes it will.

138
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,233
- And you must be Christine Henson.

139
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,629
It's a pleasure to meet you, young lady.

140
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,463
- Thanks.

141
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,269
- Well, now that we've met, I'll expect

142
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,609
to see both of you in church this Sunday.

143
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,779
- Well, we don't really go to church.

144
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,613
- Please.

145
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,510
I'll look forward to seeing you,

146
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:00,530
(shop bell rings)

147
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,059
(solemn music)

148
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,415
- Julia.

149
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:14,310
My dear Julia.

150
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,129
Only you would choose such
an appropriate place to meet,

151
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,103
here among the souls who
guard the gates of hell.

152
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,190
- Reverend, when you said
you needed to talk...

153
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,903
- I have a gift for you.

154
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,943
A token of my trust in your abilities.

155
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,033
Don't fail me.

156
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,693
- I'm sure this gift comes with a price.

157
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,733
- Copperton has several new arrivals.

158
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,153
Inquisitive and fresh.

159
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,219
They must be integrated.

160
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,803
- The shepherd must increase his flock.

161
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,593
- Don't challenge my authority, Julia.

162
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,413
- I wouldn't think of it.

163
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,279
Your control is firm, Reverend.

164
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,243
You should have no fear from me.

165
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,944
- I want their souls.

166
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,125
(church bell rings)

167
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:55,376
(reverent organ music)

168
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:15,811
- Friends.

169
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,020
I would like to take this opportunity

170
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,659
to welcome to our
community Mr. Paul Henson

171
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,163
and his daughter, Christine.

172
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,719
I'm sure Mr. Henson will find Copperton

173
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,347
to be quite hospitable.

174
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:36,598
(dramatic organ music)

175
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,483
Last week, I spoke of loyalty and trust.

176
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:52,010
Loyalty to your community
and loyalty to your church.

177
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,853
Now I speak today of discipline.

178
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,153
Discipline of all of us.

179
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,913
Not just the smaller
members of our society,

180
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,293
but each and every one of us.

181
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,843
Now, what do I mean by discipline?

182
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,839
By discipline, I mean the complete refusal

183
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,690
to tolerate anyone who tries to infect us

184
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,163
with the disease of their own ideas.

185
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,230
It says in the Bible, "be
vigilant, and watch for traitors."

186
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,559
And we as a community must not allow liars

187
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,503
and infiltrators into our midst.

188
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,743
They must be sought out.

189
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,063
They must be uncovered.

190
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,497
Lest we allow them to destroy
all the power we have gained.

191
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:11,613
We have the power to
control our own destiny.

192
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,763
And we must not let others
take that away from us.

193
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:25,574
We must not disappoint the master

194
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,303
when he returns to inherit his kingdom.

195
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,580
- [Congregation] Yes.

196
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,004
(people chattering)

197
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,936
- How nice to see you.

198
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,769
Doing well?

199
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,651
- You were just wonderful.

200
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:43,652
(people chattering)

201
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,429
- What did you think, Mr. Henson?

202
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,019
- Interesting.

203
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,269
- I'd like to talk to you
some more, Mr. Henson,

204
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,253
about our church and its members.

205
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,339
And what did you think, Christine?

206
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,263
- It was fantastic.

207
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,069
- You certainly take a
very defensive position

208
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,239
in the church, Reverend.

209
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,723
- We prefer to call it protective.

210
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,293
- Protective?

211
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:14,386
(typewriter clacking)

212
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:17,599
(ribbon tears) Shit.

213
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,233
- Mr. Henson, what's wrong?

214
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,799
- I just snapped another ribbon.

215
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,779
I'm gonna have to go to the
store and get another one.

216
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,599
And Evelyn, would you please
stop calling me Mr. Henson?

217
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,609
It's Paul, okay?

218
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,439
- Want me to get you one?

219
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,959
- No, I need the damn exercise.

220
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,039
Any word yet from Shannon?

221
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,943
- Sorry.

222
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:39,460
(Paul sighs)

223
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,680
(ominous music)

224
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,723
- Excuse me.

225
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,399
Excuse me, but why have all of
these pages been blacked out?

226
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,599
- Protection.

227
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,619
- Protection?

228
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,119
Protection from what?

229
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,043
- From you.

230
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:47,912
(ominous music)

231
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,843
- Mr. Thompson.

232
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:03,209
- What can I do for you, Mr. Henson?

233
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,689
- I need a 40 CC typewriter
ribbon, but they're pretty rare.

234
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,919
I hope you've got one.

235
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,752
- Let me check.

236
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,279
Hell, we've got shit left
over from World War II.

237
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,231
I saw that someplace
down here the other day.

238
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:16,139
I thought I'd never get rid of it.

239
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,797
But I knew somebody would
one, want something like that.

240
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,536
(tense music)

241
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:57,314
(ominous music)

242
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:01,070
Found 'em.

243
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,667
(church bell ringing)

244
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:14,849
- God, I'm sorry.

245
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,500
I don't know where I was looking.

246
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,019
- You're Paul Henson.

247
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,406
Editor of the...

248
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,199
- "Copperton Chronicle."
- yeah.

249
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,549
That's right.

250
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,349
Well, I'm Julia Francine.

251
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,669
I teach at the school.

252
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,949
Your daughter?
- Christine.

253
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,782
- Yeah.

254
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:31,229
Bright girl.

255
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,509
So how do you two like Copperton?

256
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,689
- It's different.

257
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,629
Not exactly what I
expected from a small town.

258
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,719
- Many things aren't what
we expect, Mr. Henson.

259
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,703
- Call me Paul, please.

260
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,119
- Call me Julia, Paul.

261
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,953
Anytime.

262
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:02,662
(thunder crashing)
(ominous music)

263
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,496
(shop bell rings)

264
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,629
- Evening, Larry.

265
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,033
- Reverend, I can explain everything.

266
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:18,418
(thunder crashing)

267
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,757
- Not locking up well, eh Larry?

268
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:35,112
- There you are.

269
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:37,259
I was wondering where you've been.

270
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,609
- Paul, listen to me.

271
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,409
I found something you
should take a look at.

272
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,363
This is not a drug related murder.

273
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,739
I couldn't understand it at first.

274
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,569
But then when I saw the marks,

275
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,429
my god, Paul, they're identical.

276
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,539
- Come on, Shannon.

277
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,639
Identical markings are not everything.

278
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,079
Just proves that maybe...

279
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,599
- It proves that my hunch
could be true, Paul.

280
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,639
Suppose it's possible that we may have

281
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,440
stumbled onto us onto-
- Onto what?

282
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
- Sheriff will put us both
in the jail for lunacy.

283
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,439
- Something's going on here.

284
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,119
1974, Springfield, Illinois, satanic cult

285
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,179
kills two teenage kids, markings and cuts

286
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,473
all over their bodies.

287
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,729
1982, bodies found in a
deserted parking lot near Miami.

288
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,009
Cult markings all over.

289
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,769
Blood removed by needles, found later

290
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,963
in the stomachs of people caught.

291
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,609
1986, Athens, Ohio, Paul.

292
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,239
Two teenagers killed by
possible satanic cult,

293
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,879
including a 16 year old girl.

294
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,713
- Daddy?

295
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,023
Daddy?

296
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
- Write up a story for tomorrow.

297
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,609
Include a drawing of the marks.

298
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,899
- Daddy?

299
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,743
What's wrong?

300
00:21:57,475 --> 00:22:00,725
(cheerful organ music)

301
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,319
(discordant organ music)

302
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,493
- Very nice, Mary.

303
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,403
Very nice.

304
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,529
How's school for you this year?

305
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,363
- Fine.

306
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,669
- And that boy you're dating.

307
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,349
What's his name?

308
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,029
- Rob, Robbie.

309
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,933
- Robert.

310
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,633
How is he?

311
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,403
- We're going to college this
fall, at the state university.

312
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,473
- How wonderful.

313
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,749
Copperton hates to lose one
of its fine young people.

314
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,281
You'll be missed.

315
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,782
(tense music)

316
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:59,143
So I guess this is goodbye, Mary.

317
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,490
- Well, I won't be leaving
for a few more weeks.

318
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,863
- Goodbye, Mary.
(siren wailing)

319
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:27,225
(chattering on police radio)

320
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:31,979
(birds cawing)

321
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:36,689
- You god damn son of a bitch!

322
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,009
What the hell you doing?

323
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,969
- Sheriff!
- What are you?

324
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,843
Get off of me.

325
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,169
Why?

326
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,299
- Why are you trying to
stir up trouble here?

327
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,929
Ever since you moved here,
all this shit's going down,

328
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,179
and now you trying to
scare people even more!

329
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,589
Why, god dammit, why?!

330
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,779
- Sheriff, you have got to believe me.

331
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,729
The evidence we have, it
all points to something

332
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,653
much bigger than a damn drug murder.

333
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,873
You gonna tell me this was
a drug murder too, Sheriff?

334
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,599
Look, somehow, some way,
this girl and the guy

335
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,629
killed last week, they
tie into a larger picture.

336
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,399
The wounds...

337
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,079
The wounds are the same.

338
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,279
Sheriff, what did Mary do?

339
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,689
Did she have a job?

340
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,029
An after school activity, what?

341
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,219
Sheriff, god dammit, open your eyes!

342
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,559
- Back the fuck off, Henson,
or I'll throw your ass in jail!

343
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,392
- On what charge?!

344
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:27,292
- I'll make one up!

345
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,876
(birds cawing)

346
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,368
(tense music)

347
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,939
- Mary never did nothing to nobody.

348
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,349
Hell, she used to babysit for the mayor

349
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,599
and some other people in town.

350
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,000
- Who do you think did this?

351
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,040
- Couldn't really tell you.

352
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:56,358
But I will tell you one thing.

353
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,269
She used to play the
organ for the Reverend.

354
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,103
- Donovan?

355
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,639
(Paul clears throat)

356
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,139
- May I help you?

357
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,729
- I'd like to see the mayor.

358
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,549
I'm Paul Henson, editor of
"The Copperton Chronicle?"

359
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,809
- Hmm.

360
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,869
Strange first edition, Mr. Henson.

361
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,459
If you ask me, it wasn't
any kinda satanic cult.

362
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,260
No, it was UFOs.

363
00:25:39,953 --> 00:25:41,579
- UFOs.

364
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,343
- Yeah, strange things
been happening around here.

365
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,582
- Mr. Mayor?

366
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,119
- Oh yes, you must be...

367
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,439
- Paul Henson, "Copperton Chronicle."

368
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,729
- How are you, Mr. Henson?

369
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,562
- Just fine.

370
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:53,939
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few
questions about Mary Rhodes.

371
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,289
- Oh, sad.

372
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,059
Very, very sad.

373
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,339
She was such a bright girl, too.

374
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,349
- I understand she babysat
for you and your wife.

375
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,269
- Of course, she never
could really stay away

376
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,889
from that Robby boy.

377
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,109
- Sir, did she ever show
any signs of being in a-

378
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,009
- Into drugs?

379
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,849
Drugs?!

380
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,249
America's war on drugs not strong enough

381
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,449
for our young people, I'm afraid.

382
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,409
Damn shame.

383
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,329
- Sir, I have a stack of evidence here,

384
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,162
if you could just take some-

385
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:17,999
- Yes, well I'd give those to the DA.

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,950
I have to rush off, but good
luck to you in your newspaper.

387
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:30,118
(bubble pops) (tense music)

388
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,243
- Drugs.

389
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,419
It's an opening shut case, drugs.

390
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,807
- That's it?

391
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:20,999
That's all the attention you're gonna give

392
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,449
to these two murders that
happened right in your backyard?

393
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:28,289
- Look, I can't really help you guys.

394
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,699
I think you're jumping to conclusions.

395
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,659
- Conclusions?!

396
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,059
For Christ's sakes, sir,
you have two people,

397
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,709
one of 'em a teenage girl, hacked up,

398
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,539
and you think it's all related to drugs?

399
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,679
You're crazy!

400
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,939
I mean, what the hell do I have to do

401
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,739
to get a decent criminal investigation

402
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,849
going on in this town?

403
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,609
I can't get any cooperation
from you, not from the sheriff,

404
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,569
not from anyone.

405
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,499
Maybe it's me.

406
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,504
Maybe mutilated bodies
are an everyday occurrence

407
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:49,709
here in Copperton.

408
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,059
Tell me, what!
(thunder rumbling)

409
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,799
- I wish I could help you guys.

410
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,299
But my resources are limited.

411
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,379
- I'll say limited.

412
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,779
You're not doing a damn thing.

413
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,623
- I'm sorry.

414
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,703
- Paul. (Rain pattering)

415
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,853
- You got lousy taste and
paperweights, counselor.

416
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:21,525
(thunder crashing)

417
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:26,526
(baby crying)
(ominous organ music)

418
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,939
- Another one for you, master.

419
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,523
Another child in your holy name.

420
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:46,986
(congregation applauding)

421
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,759
- Soon, ladies, you too will know

422
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,203
the benefits of motherhood.

423
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,019
The benefits of giving another
gift from our lord and master

424
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,853
to our sacred church.

425
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,583
How I do envy you.

426
00:29:14,547 --> 00:29:18,670
We must now seal up the
open wound in our town.

427
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:26,249
Purge the sick plague that has infested

428
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,070
our homes and even...

429
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,933
Even our church.

430
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,123
They must be stopped!

431
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,583
At all costs.

432
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:46,043
(tense music)

433
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:52,602
- Who else has access
to the maternity ward?

434
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,949
- Only me and another nurse.

435
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,363
Susan Richardson.

436
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,233
- Is she the one who was killed?

437
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,212
- Oh god, I'm so sorry.

438
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:05,380
So very sorry.

439
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,519
- [TV Reporter] Repeating
our final story tonight,

440
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,139
The Bellevue Hospital maternity ward

441
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,209
was broken into late last night

442
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,389
and all 12 of the
children have been taken.

443
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,463
Their whereabouts at this
hour are still unknown.

444
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:22,381
(thunder crashing)

445
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:27,131
(mysterious music)

446
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:36,089
- He's been in all
morning waiting for you.

447
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:36,922
- Who is he?

448
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:38,733
- Kane, Reverend Kane, old fart.

449
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:43,559
(Paul clears throat)

450
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,433
- Can I help you?

451
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,073
- Paul Henson?

452
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,769
I'm Reverend Kane.

453
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,299
I've read your articles.

454
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,649
- Articles?

455
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,438
- The ones about the cult.

456
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,473
Excuse me.

457
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,849
Possible cult.

458
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,349
That's why I'm here.

459
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,869
- This is Shannon Cornell,
the journalist on the story.

460
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,549
You know, I still don't understand why-

461
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,289
- Why I'm here.?

462
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,449
I spend my life traveling
to hundreds of towns

463
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,283
like Copperton.

464
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,649
Small, tiny spots on the map that no one

465
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,079
seems to ever pay any attention to,

466
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,419
except when something bizarre occurs,

467
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,253
something, no one can explain.

468
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,499
Some label it druggies, hippies, freaks,

469
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,689
but they all have something in common,

470
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,839
a basic common element of pure evil.

471
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,639
Malicious intent?

472
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,723
Oh yes, quite.

473
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,469
Only their intent goes
much deeper and darker

474
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,883
than others ever imagine.

475
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,123
A satanic cult?

476
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,813
Very interesting.

477
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,743
Someone here finally has
the courage to speak up.

478
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,989
These murders you've had here.

479
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,549
Did you know this isn't the first time

480
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,279
something like this has happened here?

481
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,399
10 years ago, man by the name of Dobson,

482
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,059
good old black Dobson,
butchered several infants

483
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,923
in a shack not too far from here.

484
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,333
The local police ruled it a
simple case of sick insanity,

485
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,110
but it went much deeper than that.

486
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:21,285
If you truly have this
type of situation here,

487
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,913
I'll be able to identify it.

488
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,340
- Take a look at these.

489
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,603
- Police ruled this a drug case.

490
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,019
Is this all the evidence you have?

491
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,253
- Concrete, yeah.

492
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,459
- We need to speak to Dobson.

493
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,775
- Where is he?

494
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:55,983
- Loganville prison.

495
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,407
I helped put him there.

496
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:00,991
(solemn music)

497
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,109
- Beats the hell outta me why anybody'd

498
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,179
wanna see this freak.

499
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,583
We shoulda given him the
chair, crazy bastard.

500
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:17,514
(tense music)

501
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,363
- Dobson.

502
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,859
- Who the hell are you?

503
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,149
- Kane.

504
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,829
Reverend Kane.

505
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,873
I've come to ask you a few questions.

506
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:50,523
- Kane, Reverend Kane?

507
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,894
Bastard.

508
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:55,145
You fuckin' son of a bitch!

509
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,989
- Be still!

510
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,163
Be still.

511
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,863
Where's the holy place?

512
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,119
Where is the holy place?

513
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,159
Is it the forest?

514
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,583
The woods near Copperton?

515
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:16,110
(Dobson laughing)

516
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:18,215
- No, no.

517
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:20,020
Only for the unworthy.

518
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:21,854
Only for the unworthy.

519
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,583
- Where is the holy place?

520
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,213
- Fuck you, holy man.

521
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,343
- Is it the church?

522
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,839
Or is it the lake?

523
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,953
The Briar lake.

524
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,320
Or is it...

525
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,280
The quarry?

526
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:48,114
- [Dobson] Go to hell!

527
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:53,447
- Who is in Copperton?

528
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:57,288
Come here.

529
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:00,949
Who is it? (Dobson spits)

530
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,533
(solemn music)

531
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,569
We'll find him out.

532
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,195
Dobson.

533
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:09,396
You can be sure of that.

534
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,183
Don't forget Dobson.

535
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,803
In the eyes of God, all is forgiven.

536
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,900
- I didn't tell them.

537
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,483
I didn't tell them anything.

538
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
I didn't tell them anything.

539
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,717
I didn't tell them.

540
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:46,051
I didn't tell them anything.

541
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:02,789
- Shannon's at the library doing research.

542
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,440
- Let's pray she finds something.

543
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,499
- Where do you think they'd have it?

544
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,409
- Wherever the sun's rays
are the brightest at dawn.

545
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,699
- Why?

546
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,300
- That's when they like to
perform their black mass.

547
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,809
It looks like a flat part at
the bottom near the water.

548
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,860
Let's try over there.

549
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,167
(tense music)

550
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,597
- They could cover everything up.

551
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,952
- Yes.

552
00:36:57,953 --> 00:36:59,283
Or they could move it.

553
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:10,352
(eerie music)

554
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:13,046
- My god.

555
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,462
- Oh dear god.

556
00:37:16,463 --> 00:37:18,273
You better get over here.

557
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:24,479
(dramatic music)

558
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:36,725
- Those bones.

559
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,169
- Babies.

560
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,283
Newborn babies.

561
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,030
Sacrificed to Satan for his gift of power

562
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,053
and the hope for his gift of strength.

563
00:37:51,163 --> 00:37:54,140
A child's blood is precious in their eyes.

564
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:55,836
- The hospital.

565
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,133
They were taken here.

566
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,853
This happens all the time, all over.

567
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,453
Usually it's an isolated case.

568
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,710
Police figure it's one
of the parents took it.

569
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,873
Never like this.

570
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,773
Never.

571
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,983
- Thompson.

572
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,893
Christ, killing their own.

573
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,610
- We have a problem here.

574
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,429
Who is the local preacher?

575
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,993
- Some psycho named Donovan.

576
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,530
- I wanna speak with him.

577
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,960
He may know something about this.

578
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,300
- Reverend, wonder if we might
talk to you for a minute?

579
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:30,719
Your cross is upside down, Reverend.

580
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,679
- What?

581
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,969
- Your cross.

582
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,769
- Oh, yes.

583
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,793
So it is.

584
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,999
- Reverend Donovan, this is Reverend Kane.

585
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,709
He's here looking into
the possible connection

586
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,689
with satanic cults and the murders

587
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,249
of those two people this week.

588
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,337
- Reverend Kane.

589
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:48,839
Is that the same Kane that
found those unfortunate children

590
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,390
down in Hillsborough last year?

591
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,920
And the man who put Dobson
away for the baby murders?

592
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,063
Ah, yes.

593
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,810
I've heard a lot about you indeed.

594
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,239
So now you've come to Copperton to hunt

595
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,613
for more witches and
warlocks, eh Reverend?

596
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,510
Well, I can tell you one thing.

597
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,659
You won't find them here.

598
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,689
- That's why we came to you,
to see if you knew anything,

599
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,369
seen anything.

600
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,749
The church says that-

601
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,399
- Whose church?

602
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,043
Your church, not mine.

603
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,059
My church obeys the rules I create,

604
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,029
not some long ago superstitious ideology

605
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,403
that speaks of right or
wrong, good and evil.

606
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,309
A church is the creation of its believers,

607
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,049
not the other way around.

608
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,200
It's going to rain now.

609
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,130
I have to finish the
work, if you'll excuse me.

610
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,726
(mysterious music)

611
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:52,739
"And they shall go forth and
look upon the dead bodies

612
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,873
of the men that have rebelled against me,

613
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,909
for their worm shall not die, their fire

614
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,789
shall not be quenched, and they shall be

615
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,467
an abhorrence to all flesh."

616
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,443
Isaiah 66-24.

617
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:19,604
(ominous organ music)

618
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:23,669
(school bell rings)

619
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,749
- Christine.

620
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,189
- Miss Francine.

621
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,839
God, you scared me.

622
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,329
- You're one of our brightest students.

623
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,759
Tell me, what do you think of the topics

624
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,110
we've covered in class
since you've moved here?

625
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:40,409
- Well, interesting,
but, well, a little...

626
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,283
- Peculiar?

627
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,619
- But it is an interesting
look at history.

628
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,169
I never heard of Alistair-
- Crowley.

629
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,239
- Yeah, or his works.

630
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,519
And your perspective on Adolf Hitler

631
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,799
and his position on complete authority.

632
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,269
Interesting.

633
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,849
- How does your father feel about our town

634
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,709
and what we believe in?

635
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,589
- He's looking into it.

636
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,309
- Tell me, Christine, wouldn't
you wanna be one of us?

637
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,499
Control your own destiny.

638
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,269
Dominate others.

639
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,609
See your dreams and fantasies come to life

640
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,473
before your very eyes?

641
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,350
- I've got to go.

642
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,839
- Think about the offer, Christine.

643
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,847
Happiness and fulfillment await.

644
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:29,765
(mysterious music)

645
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,749
- We found bones.

646
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,629
Bones that could be
linked to numerous murders

647
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,189
here and around the state.

648
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,396
Now, I think that deserves some attention.

649
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:43,199
- Oh, excuse me.

650
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,959
Damn allergies, I hate rain.

651
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,503
So what's the sheriff think
about your quarry hopping?

652
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,643
- He won't return my
phone calls, or see us.

653
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,383
- Hmm.

654
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,139
- Look, Mayor, I think this matter

655
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,789
needs to be taken more seriously.

656
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,129
I mean the sheriff is
practically ignoring me,

657
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,299
the district attorney is pretending

658
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,279
like the situation doesn't exist.

659
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,589
I mean, Jesus, we found bones.

660
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,239
Children's bones.

661
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,889
I can't get these people interested

662
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,229
when in fact I probably need the FBI.

663
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,259
Mayor, quite frankly, I need
your support on this one.

664
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,106
I need you behind me every
step of the way on this.

665
00:43:21,107 --> 00:43:23,857
(Mayor coughing)

666
00:43:26,278 --> 00:43:27,959
(Mayor blowing nose)

667
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,613
Children's bones.

668
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:40,070
But I realize that you
are a very, very busy man.

669
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,863
So thank you, Mr. Mayor.

670
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,190
We'll be leaving you now.

671
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:53,249
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

672
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:09,568
(thunder crashing)

673
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,229
So we have a conspiracy
involving the mayor, the DA,

674
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,839
several townspeople, possibly many more.

675
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,469
- Possibly the sheriff.

676
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,189
- Yeah, well that would
explain his actions, but why?

677
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,349
I mean, why a conspiracy?

678
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,183
Protect someone?

679
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,633
- Donovan.

680
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,999
This upside down cross on the arm tells me

681
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,309
this is a cult whose leader insists upon

682
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,893
discipline and service.

683
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,693
The mark of Satanism, and of Donovan.

684
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,469
- How does the first
victim tie into all this?

685
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,769
I didn't see any marks on
his body resembling a cross.

686
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,130
- Possibly an innocent victim, or...

687
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,629
Maybe he knew something about them,

688
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,179
something they had to kill him for.

689
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,619
- Like Thompson.

690
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,233
- I think Thompson let
you see too much that day.

691
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,213
And he paid for it.

692
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,693
Mary wanted to leave.

693
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,322
For college.

694
00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:17,309
- And they didn't want her to.

695
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,889
- Many people join these cults.

696
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,755
Few people come out.

697
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,339
(solemn music)

698
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,559
(mysterious music)

699
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,640
This upside down cross on the arm

700
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,209
tells me this is a cult whose leader

701
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,649
insists upon discipline and service.

702
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,157
The mark of Satanism, and of Donovan.

703
00:45:42,797 --> 00:45:45,213
- So the whole town's behind this nut.

704
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,893
- I'm going to talk with Donovan.

705
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,229
- Are you crazy?

706
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,369
This guy's sick.

707
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,959
He'll kill you.

708
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,329
- We can't let them scare us.

709
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,863
If we do, they've already won.

710
00:46:08,575 --> 00:46:11,158
(door banging)

711
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,023
- Hello, Charles.

712
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,030
- I didn't tell him anything.

713
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,403
- Donovan, I swear to you.

714
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:39,204
(tense music)

715
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,123
- No.

716
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,833
No, not like that.

717
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,116
- Put it in your arm.

718
00:46:48,117 --> 00:46:49,623
- No, please, Donovan.

719
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:55,027
- Put it in your arm, or
we'll put it in your eye.

720
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:08,373
(ominous music)

721
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:18,210
(man shouting)

722
00:47:22,024 --> 00:47:24,941
(insects chirping)

723
00:47:37,725 --> 00:47:40,225
(tense music)

724
00:48:47,353 --> 00:48:48,953
- I thought I heard you come in.

725
00:48:51,154 --> 00:48:52,704
I heard Mary Rhodes was killed.

726
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,392
What happened?

727
00:48:55,393 --> 00:48:56,968
(solemn music)

728
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,649
- I don't know, honey.

729
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,673
But I don't think it had
anything to do with drugs.

730
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,805
- She was an A student.

731
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:07,889
She was going to college.

732
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,073
Just doesn't make any sense.

733
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,333
- Nowadays, nothing really does.

734
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:19,920
- Thinking about Mom?

735
00:49:21,364 --> 00:49:22,697
- Yeah.
- Me too.

736
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,399
Mom used to say that when
a little kid gets scared

737
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,093
or lonely, God sends down one
of his angels to protect them.

738
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,800
Why are there so many
sick people in this world.

739
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,070
- I don't know, honey.

740
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,800
- Maybe Mom was wrong.

741
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:03,124
(rain gushing)

742
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:17,238
- Donovan.

743
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,203
I know all about you now.

744
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:39,968
(thunder crashing)

745
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,633
- Alistair Crowley.

746
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:45,483
A man well ahead of his time.

747
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,673
A great Satanist.

748
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,483
But a poor leader of souls.

749
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,323
- You're finished.

750
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,559
I'm breaking it up.

751
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,919
(Donovan laughing)

752
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,109
- You amuse me, Kane.

753
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:08,009
I never thought a man of a
forgotten god could be so funny.

754
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,489
- How dare you defile God in his house?

755
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,589
- Whose god?

756
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,739
My god is having the time of his life.

757
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,129
You are too blind to see
the power he gives us

758
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,963
for being his servants.

759
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,653
Power to rule over our own brethren.

760
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,432
Power to destroy the
meek and the treacherous.

761
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:31,529
(thunder crashing)

762
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,953
Does your god give you power, Kane?

763
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,503
No.

764
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,243
You follow a myth.

765
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,123
A legend.

766
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,143
We have the world at our command.

767
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:51,843
He will soon return.

768
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,313
And the world will know
he is truly our savior.

769
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,483
- You sick, pathetic creature.

770
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,699
Innocent people have-

771
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,699
- Innocent people have
died all over the world

772
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,293
at different times in history.

773
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,643
They've died for holy reasons
more so than any other.

774
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,759
It has always been the
case that the strong

775
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,703
dominate the weak, for
us it is no different.

776
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,859
What do a few measly souls
mean to a new nation,

777
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,143
to a new religion, to a new god?

778
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,299
To proclaim a new god in blood.

779
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,983
Holy, holy blood.

780
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,279
My people shall join me
in joy as we sacrifice

781
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,393
countless weak, useless lives
for the glory of the master.

782
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,230
And you and all your religion...

783
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,359
Can't stop us.

784
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,653
- No more, Donovan.

785
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,129
Your sick game is over.
(gun clicks)

786
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,663
- No, my foolish friend.

787
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:00,123
It's just begun.

788
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:02,609
- Ooh!

789
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,098
(solemn organ music)

790
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,135
(Donovan laughing)

791
00:53:08,136 --> 00:53:13,019
- Cheers. (Laughing)

792
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:30,074
(thunder crashing)

793
00:53:32,274 --> 00:53:35,024
(rain pattering)

794
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:40,407
(tense music)

795
00:53:40,408 --> 00:53:43,075
(Kane coughing)

796
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:50,992
(thunder rumbling)

797
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:16,941
(thunder crashing)

798
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:24,059
- Just a game, eh, old man?

799
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,533
Is this fun for you?

800
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,716
You'll be our latest sacrifice.

801
00:54:28,717 --> 00:54:29,549
(thunder crashing)

802
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,049
But don't worry.

803
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,550
You'll have plenty of company.

804
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,049
Tell your god about me.

805
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,189
Warn him.

806
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,336
- You'll rot in hell!

807
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:41,587
- How exciting.

808
00:54:44,899 --> 00:54:47,816
(thunder crashing)

809
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:52,688
We look for light...
(thunder crashing)

810
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,606
But find only darkness.

811
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,879
(thunder rumbling)

812
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,929
- Why was Kane so desperate
to see Donovan without us?

813
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,079
Do you think he's holding
something back from us?

814
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,729
- I don't know.

815
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,429
Stuff about the rest of the
town makes sense, though.

816
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,830
I mean, they follow him
around like little pets.

817
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:21,863
Are you okay?

818
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,199
- [Shannon] How about you?

819
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,609
- I'm fine.

820
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,910
God, do I need some sleep.

821
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,219
- [Shannon] Paul?

822
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,053
- Hmm?

823
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,573
- [Shannon] What happened to your wife?

824
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,130
- She was killed by a drunk driver

825
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,570
while picking up Christine from school.

826
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,593
Bastards never sleep.

827
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,980
We moved here to get away
from the horrors of the city.

828
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,661
Ran right back into it.

829
00:55:58,662 --> 00:56:01,245
(solemn music)

830
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,300
I hope that wasn't outta pity.

831
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:37,509
(phone ringing)

832
00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:41,606
- Hello.

833
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,440
Hello?

834
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,513
- Daddy?

835
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,979
Is anything wrong?

836
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,182
- No, honey.

837
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:50,039
It's just a wrong number.

838
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:50,890
Go back to sleep.

839
00:56:54,816 --> 00:56:57,816
(dial tone beeping)

840
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,587
(water running)

841
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,713
- Shannon.

842
00:57:20,025 --> 00:57:21,479
- [Shannon] Who the hell are you?

843
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,399
- Julia Francine.

844
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,943
We haven't met yet, but we
do have a common interest.

845
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,643
Paul Henson.

846
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,342
- What about him?
(eerie music)

847
00:57:31,343 --> 00:57:34,226
- The longer you continue to work for him,

848
00:57:34,227 --> 00:57:36,959
the more trouble you're gonna bring him

849
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,299
and that pretty little daughter of his.

850
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,350
- Look, how the hell did you get in here?

851
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:46,893
- Leave Copperton, Miss Cornell.

852
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,729
It'll do us all a lot of good.

853
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,259
- Look, if you don't get out of here,

854
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,969
I'm gonna call the police.

855
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,350
- Do it, bitch.

856
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:56,969
(tense music)

857
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,803
How easy it would be to break you.

858
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,947
Leave here now.

859
00:58:08,923 --> 00:58:11,506
(solemn music)

860
00:58:39,169 --> 00:58:41,669
(tense music)

861
00:58:43,082 --> 00:58:45,832
(cheerful music)

862
00:58:49,379 --> 00:58:52,296
(mysterious music)

863
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:05,442
(knocking on door)

864
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,419
- Miss Francine.

865
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,529
- Julia.

866
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:14,363
Remember?

867
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,979
May I come in?

868
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,259
- It's really, really late.

869
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,363
- Please, Paul, it's important.

870
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,290
- Now what can I do for you?

871
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,939
- Paul, listen to me.

872
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,889
I'm afraid for you and Christine.

873
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:42,539
- Why?

874
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,689
- Because things, events
have taken place here,

875
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:49,589
which, they could affect
you and your daughter.

876
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,729
I wouldn't want that to happen.

877
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,349
- Do you mean the cult?

878
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,650
What do you know about it?

879
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,269
- Enough to know you're in danger

880
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,219
if you stay on the outside.

881
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,329
- Outside?

882
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,162
Are you saying-

883
01:00:01,163 --> 01:00:04,349
- Paul, safety and security
for you and your daughter

884
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:08,498
is no problem if you just listen to us.

885
01:00:08,499 --> 01:00:11,923
(mysterious music)

886
01:00:11,924 --> 01:00:12,757
Paul.

887
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:15,633
- I'd like you to leave.

888
01:00:16,663 --> 01:00:17,496
Now.

889
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,749
- When you see the truth, you know where

890
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:28,900
you can reach me, Paul.

891
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:43,319
(gun clicks)

892
01:00:55,377 --> 01:00:58,294
(knocking on door)

893
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,799
- Sheriff, what?

894
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,629
- Don't fuck with me, Henson!

895
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,179
Where were you last
night around 11 o'clock?

896
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,619
- 11 o'clock last night.

897
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,919
I just got back from driving
Shannon Cornell home.

898
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,449
Is there something wrong, Sheriff?

899
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,919
- Damn right something's wrong.

900
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,469
I got me a goddamn dead man,
and all indicators tell me

901
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,969
you had something to do with it.

902
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,023
- Jesus, who's dead?

903
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,673
- Slit throat, right across here.

904
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,019
- Sheriff, I know the man that did this.

905
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,569
He's right here in your town,
you could arrest him now.

906
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:31,859
- Hold on.

907
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,299
What proof do you have?

908
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,209
I need proof before you
go off rattling names.

909
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,160
Could get us in a whole lot of trouble.

910
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,920
That's all he had.

911
01:01:49,837 --> 01:01:52,337
(tense music)

912
01:01:53,288 --> 01:01:55,229
What'd you find?

913
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,639
- Nothing, nothing, Sheriff.

914
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,009
It's just an old hat, I guess.

915
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,165
Thanks for your help.

916
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:02,666
(tense music)

917
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,850
What happened to him?

918
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,733
- Suicide.

919
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:20,907
(tires squeal)

920
01:02:22,802 --> 01:02:25,719
(knocking on door)

921
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,473
- Paul.

922
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,415
Kane.

923
01:02:36,597 --> 01:02:38,853
- [Paul] I don't know
who to trust anymore.

924
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:43,413
- Paul, I have a confession to make.

925
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,279
I'm here because I'm part of a team

926
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,429
looking into satanic cults
in this part of the country,

927
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,199
with "The Times."

928
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,693
My partner is the John
Doe they found last week.

929
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,979
He was killed because he had
proof of their blood rituals.

930
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,443
I know this sounds hard to believe.

931
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,263
I don't even know if I believe
it, but it's the truth.

932
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,850
- Your friend sent these to Kane.

933
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:11,843
- He knew.

934
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:16,049
The sheriff didn't find any
of those things, did he?

935
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,029
- He didn't check inside the hat.

936
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,539
I also found the name of Thomas Crane.

937
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,459
Apparently he's an
ex-member of Donovan's cult

938
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,799
who managed to escape last year.

939
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,149
I wanna meet with him.

940
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,650
Maybe you can identify the
people in these photos.

941
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:32,103
- It'll be dangerous.

942
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,093
I don't want you hurt, Paul.

943
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:33,179
- Hello, Paul.

944
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,583
- The hell do you want, murderer?

945
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,820
- Is that any way to talk to a reverend?

946
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,399
- You killed Kane, but not before

947
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,370
we got some very interesting negatives.

948
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:48,329
(tense music)

949
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,173
- Negatives?

950
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,263
He gave you negatives?

951
01:04:54,595 --> 01:04:55,799
- I've got 'em.

952
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,829
I've got the proof of
what you're doing here.

953
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:03,119
I've got the proof that
you are one sick bastard.

954
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,163
- Where are the negatives, Mr. Henson?

955
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:07,334
(gun clicks)

956
01:05:07,335 --> 01:05:09,877
- If you kill me, you'll never get 'em.

957
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:13,563
- Join us, Paul.

958
01:05:15,026 --> 01:05:17,352
You have no idea of the power we have

959
01:05:17,353 --> 01:05:19,623
because of our allegiance to the master.

960
01:05:22,076 --> 01:05:27,076
Anything you desire.

961
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,056
(tense music)

962
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,083
- Mr. Henson, these are simply incredible.

963
01:06:08,103 --> 01:06:09,903
God, these people are animals.

964
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,059
Who else have you showed these to?

965
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:15,893
- You're it.

966
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,929
Look, Mr. Davidson.

967
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:20,789
You're the state attorney general.

968
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,240
What can you do to stop them?

969
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,019
- Betty?

970
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,170
Get me Richardson in
the governor's office.

971
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,059
(tense music)

972
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,093
Tied up till four.

973
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,153
All right, listen carefully.

974
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,689
Arrange a meeting with
him for this afternoon.

975
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:50,009
Yes.

976
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,719
Priority six.

977
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,219
He'll know.

978
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,053
Thank you.

979
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,319
- What's priority six?

980
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,749
- Possible criminal and subversive acts.

981
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,549
The governor instigated it 14 years ago

982
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,959
after the student riots.

983
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,833
It applies here.

984
01:07:06,796 --> 01:07:08,763
All we can do now is wait.

985
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:11,579
- I have an appointment.

986
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,779
Can I come back?

987
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,612
- Call first.

988
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,929
If I have anything, I'll let you know.

989
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:17,489
Can I keep these?

990
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,802
- No.

991
01:07:18,803 --> 01:07:20,437
I think I better keep 'em.

992
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,510
- [Davidson] Very well.

993
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:44,068
(country music)

994
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,399
- Thomas Green?

995
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,233
- Paul Henson?

996
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:15,629
They're always, always watching.

997
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,679
- Donovan?

998
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,523
In the capital?

999
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:22,589
- How do you think he's managed so far?

1000
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,969
He's got so many officials under him,

1001
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,670
he could be governor of the state.

1002
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,653
Were you followed?

1003
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:31,223
- I'm not sure.

1004
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,083
Maybe.

1005
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:39,303
- Mr. Henson, do you believe in God?

1006
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,109
- Why?

1007
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:46,083
- Because if you go up against
Donovan, you'd better start.

1008
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:58,173
Yes!

1009
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,155
God, you can put him
away with these things!

1010
01:09:02,156 --> 01:09:03,839
(mysterious music)

1011
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,459
Who else have you shown them to?

1012
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,049
- Just you.

1013
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,583
Oh, and the attorney general.

1014
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,979
- Dear god, no.

1015
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,468
- It goes as high as him?

1016
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:13,995
(tense music)

1017
01:09:13,996 --> 01:09:16,828
(gun clicks)

1018
01:09:16,829 --> 01:09:19,746
(gunshots banging)

1019
01:09:34,168 --> 01:09:36,001
- [Man] The hell, man?

1020
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,379
(tires squealing)

1021
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:44,659
(gunshots banging)

1022
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,425
(tires squealing)

1023
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,978
(heavy metal music)

1024
01:11:20,289 --> 01:11:21,122
- God.

1025
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,299
- Help you, Mister?

1026
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,132
- Thank God.

1027
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:33,509
Look, I'm being shot at by
some nuts on the highway.

1028
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:34,609
I need to call ahead for some help.

1029
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:35,613
Do you have a phone?

1030
01:11:39,843 --> 01:11:42,760
(rodents squaking)

1031
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,299
- My babies.

1032
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,200
Ain't they pretty?

1033
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:51,791
(heavy metal music)

1034
01:11:54,317 --> 01:11:55,150
- Come on.

1035
01:11:57,908 --> 01:11:59,423
Come on.

1036
01:11:59,424 --> 01:12:02,257
(tires squealing)

1037
01:12:29,841 --> 01:12:32,939
(Paul grunts)

1038
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,690
(glass shatters)

1039
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:44,786
(solemn music)

1040
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:13,532
Christine?

1041
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:26,031
(tense music)

1042
01:13:29,293 --> 01:13:30,710
Fucking bastards.

1043
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:34,809
(ominous music)

1044
01:13:53,026 --> 01:13:55,448
(tires squealing)

1045
01:13:55,449 --> 01:13:58,116
(sign crashing)

1046
01:14:01,449 --> 01:14:04,169
(tense music)

1047
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:05,497
(gunshot bangs)

1048
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:06,748
Christine.

1049
01:14:06,749 --> 01:14:09,416
(gunshot bangs)

1050
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,949
What have you done with my
daughter, you son of a bitch?

1051
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,963
- She's waiting for her daddy.

1052
01:14:24,112 --> 01:14:26,779
(gunshot bangs)

1053
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,939
I'd offer you a glass of lemonade,

1054
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,164
but we're still squeezing out the juice.

1055
01:14:36,165 --> 01:14:37,559
(gunshot bangs)

1056
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,455
- You son of a bitch!

1057
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:40,873
(gun clicks)

1058
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:44,771
(Donovan chuckles)

1059
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,263
I know how high up this goes.

1060
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:51,280
I know how to stop you.

1061
01:14:52,893 --> 01:14:55,143
- I don't think you really do, Mr. Henson.

1062
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,363
- So Crane was right.

1063
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,160
- Only the governor is the last to know.

1064
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,009
We're working on that, though.

1065
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:07,709
- Where are the negatives, Mr. Henson?

1066
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,969
- Where's my daughter?

1067
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:10,979
- Really, Mr. Henson.

1068
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,599
There's nothing you can do.

1069
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,709
- Donovan.

1070
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:16,259
If you touch one hair.

1071
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,453
- It's truly useless to resist.

1072
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:22,081
(tense music)

1073
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:36,959
- Fuck you!

1074
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,017
Fuck all of you!

1075
01:16:00,044 --> 01:16:02,877
(tires squealing)

1076
01:16:06,614 --> 01:16:08,805
(tires squealing)
(horn honking)

1077
01:16:08,806 --> 01:16:11,389
(woman shouts)

1078
01:16:12,945 --> 01:16:14,351
(explosion booming)

1079
01:16:14,352 --> 01:16:15,185
Jesus!

1080
01:16:17,629 --> 01:16:20,296
(siren wailing)

1081
01:16:24,736 --> 01:16:26,501
- What in the name of...

1082
01:16:26,502 --> 01:16:29,519
- Where the hell is my
daughter, you sick bastard?!

1083
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,671
- What are you talking about?

1084
01:16:30,672 --> 01:16:32,839
I don't know where she is.

1085
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,669
What the hell's the matter with you?

1086
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,199
Sheriff.

1087
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,519
It's Donovan.

1088
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,049
He did this.
- What?

1089
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:43,739
- He's destroying this
town piece by piece.

1090
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,049
And killed most of his opponents.

1091
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:48,647
And taken my daughter.

1092
01:16:48,648 --> 01:16:51,231
(solemn music)

1093
01:17:09,813 --> 01:17:13,556
(knocking on door)

1094
01:17:13,557 --> 01:17:16,057
(tense music)

1095
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,999
(suspenseful music)
(gun clicks)

1096
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,832
- Paul, I thought it was-

1097
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,133
- They got Christine.

1098
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,119
- She could still be-
- Alive?

1099
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,023
I'm betting on it.

1100
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,593
Wire's been cut.

1101
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,539
- I have a friend at the capital.

1102
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,369
He can get us in to see
the attorney general.

1103
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:57,270
- He's one of 'em.

1104
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,730
It's gotta be the governor.

1105
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,373
- [Davidson] Only the
governor is the last to know.

1106
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:07,230
We're working on that, though.

1107
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:09,903
- We don't have much time.

1108
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,843
- Get me to a phone.

1109
01:18:14,126 --> 01:18:17,126
(church bell rings)

1110
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,413
- Reverend?

1111
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:32,129
- He came to set the captives free.

1112
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,169
- What are you doing to this town?

1113
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:36,543
- Sheriff, you and I are a lot alike.

1114
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,163
We both have our flocks to protect.

1115
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,299
- Donovan, we're gonna
get to the bottom of this.

1116
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,389
- Like primal wolves, thirsty
for the blood of our enemies,

1117
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:52,259
we thrive upon the
knowledge of power and fear.

1118
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,549
Fear keeps-

1119
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:55,019
- You have the right to remain silent.

1120
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,719
- The domination of the weak always gives

1121
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,949
power to the strong.

1122
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:01,859
- Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1123
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,692
in a court of law.

1124
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:06,119
- The holy blood of the
innocent, the wretched vow

1125
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,636
remains of the dead shall rise under him.

1126
01:19:08,637 --> 01:19:09,866
- You have the right to an attorney-

1127
01:19:09,867 --> 01:19:12,209
- And the new order shall emerge,

1128
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:14,669
and the feeble nonbelievers shall bleed,

1129
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:17,283
oh yes, bleed for their ignorant sins.

1130
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:22,919
(solemn organ music)

1131
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,389
- Okay, nobody move.

1132
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:26,643
- We will become the lion.

1133
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,347
(Sheriff shouting)

1134
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:32,598
The rest will become sheep.

1135
01:19:36,832 --> 01:19:38,163
- One hour.

1136
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:39,164
Yeah, right.

1137
01:19:41,498 --> 01:19:42,331
All set.

1138
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:52,143
- All right, let's get on the bus, slowly.

1139
01:19:57,559 --> 01:20:00,059
(tense music)

1140
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,669
- All aboard, folks.

1141
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,503
Follow me.

1142
01:20:16,259 --> 01:20:18,842
(door hissing)

1143
01:20:42,456 --> 01:20:44,956
(tense music)

1144
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,343
- Donovan.

1145
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,690
I didn't hear you come in.

1146
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:21,719
Are you reveling in your now
complete glory, Reverend?

1147
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:26,163
Satisfied knowing all your
enemies are dead and defeated?

1148
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:34,619
When you get your chance to
taste sweet virgin blood,

1149
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,043
a ritual reserved for only
the most sacred of hosts.

1150
01:21:41,114 --> 01:21:43,987
Donovan, Donovan, there truly is no end

1151
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,923
to your maniacal reach, is there?

1152
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:56,279
- You failed me, Julia.

1153
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,383
Failure has no forgiveness or sorrow.

1154
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,510
Only revenge.

1155
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:03,011
(bones crack)

1156
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,243
An errant disciple must be punished.

1157
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:12,506
Punished.

1158
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,699
- Dave, we've got enough
evidence to put Donovan

1159
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,379
and the attorney general away for murder,

1160
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,119
not to mention kidnap and embezzlement.

1161
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,519
- It's a goddamn miracle
you made it this far.

1162
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,649
Paul, we'll find your
daughter, that's a promise.

1163
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:47,483
- Ready, Paul?

1164
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:55,051
(alarm ringing)

1165
01:23:00,498 --> 01:23:02,897
- What in the living hell?

1166
01:23:02,898 --> 01:23:04,619
- Get him!
- No, listen to me!

1167
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,779
You've gotta hear this tape!

1168
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:09,323
- [Davidson] Only the
governor is the last to know.

1169
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:12,509
We're working on that, though.

1170
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:13,829
- Isn't that Richard?

1171
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:15,719
- [Paul] Where's my daughter?

1172
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,699
- [Davidson] Really, Mr. Henson.

1173
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,709
There's nothing you can do.

1174
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:22,053
It's truly useless to resist.

1175
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,423
- Who are you people?

1176
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,969
- We're from Copperton!

1177
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:29,909
The town's been taken over
by this fanatical reverend

1178
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,069
who's leading a group of satanists.

1179
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:34,049
Several people have been killed.

1180
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,849
My daughter's been kidnapped.

1181
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:38,969
- What's this have to do
with the attorney general?

1182
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:39,920
- He's one of them.

1183
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:43,559
- And the end of the world is in 23 hours,

1184
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,609
10 minutes, right?

1185
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:45,749
Let's get them the hell out of here.

1186
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:46,923
- Look at the pictures!

1187
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,147
- What pictures?
- These!

1188
01:23:52,468 --> 01:23:54,968
(tense music)

1189
01:24:03,108 --> 01:24:04,025
- Not here.

1190
01:24:05,777 --> 01:24:07,053
Not in my state.

1191
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:12,923
Let him go.

1192
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,539
If this is true, how high up?

1193
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,253
- We've got to stop them now, sir.

1194
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,600
If you're the last stop
before God knows what,

1195
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:26,819
we have got to stop them.

1196
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,120
- They have your daughter?

1197
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:36,179
Tom, organize the grand jury.

1198
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,069
Special code 112.

1199
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:40,070
And I'll be there in just a few minutes.

1200
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,493
Something I'm just
beginning to understand.

1201
01:24:45,897 --> 01:24:46,897
God help us.

1202
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,069
This evidence must have
been very difficult

1203
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:57,333
to obtain, Mr. Henson.

1204
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,169
- A lot of people died to get it here.

1205
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,119
- You have nothing to worry about.

1206
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,949
The evidence is now in
the hands of the state

1207
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,500
and soon we'll be examining it.

1208
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,740
It's almost over.

1209
01:25:11,365 --> 01:25:12,592
(tense music)

1210
01:25:12,593 --> 01:25:15,017
(gunshots banging)

1211
01:25:15,018 --> 01:25:17,851
(people shouting)

1212
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:43,846
(helicopter whirring)

1213
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,689
- Detective Stevens said that the evidence

1214
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:57,209
was ripped from the governor's
hand when he was killed.

1215
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:58,589
That rules out these two.

1216
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:59,939
- They know something.

1217
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:01,079
- So.

1218
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,419
- You're telling me these fanatics-

1219
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,469
- Satanists.

1220
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:07,229
- Satanists, killed the governor because

1221
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,299
the evidence you brought him earlier?

1222
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,319
- Yes, yes.

1223
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,789
Look, we don't have much time.

1224
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:13,289
- They-
- They what?

1225
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:14,849
- They already have what they want.

1226
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:16,739
The pictures are back in their hands.

1227
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:17,789
- So?

1228
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:19,139
- So they're gonna kill my daughter,

1229
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,729
you stupid son of a bitch!

1230
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:22,289
- Okay, okay.

1231
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:23,999
Let's start from the beginning.

1232
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,349
- No, gpd dammit!

1233
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:26,849
No more fucking questions!

1234
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:28,409
You people are sitting on your asses

1235
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,809
while these sick freaks are
about to kill my daughter

1236
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:32,249
in some pagan ritual.

1237
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,199
Now, I've told you
everything you need to know,

1238
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,659
so help us, god dammit.

1239
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,089
The entire town is run by this man,

1240
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:44,030
this sick, murdering,
self-made leader, who...

1241
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:45,743
Jesus

1242
01:26:46,832 --> 01:26:48,959
(solemn music)

1243
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,073
Who's got my baby.

1244
01:26:58,905 --> 01:27:02,579
- We're ready, Donovan.

1245
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:06,423
- The state police will detain
them for a long, long time.

1246
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,693
We have the negatives.

1247
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:14,763
Prepare the little bitch.

1248
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,659
Tonight we have the black mass.

1249
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,410
(Donovan laughs)

1250
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:29,459
- Okay, old man, make a sound or a move,

1251
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:32,369
and I'll splatter your brains
all over that front window.

1252
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:33,670
Where's the party tonight?

1253
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,193
Say good night.
- The quarry.

1254
01:27:41,455 --> 01:27:43,902
(Paul shouts)

1255
01:27:43,903 --> 01:27:45,997
(gunshot bangs)

1256
01:27:45,998 --> 01:27:48,498
(tense music)

1257
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,533
- Companions!

1258
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:19,319
We are gathered in this sacred spot

1259
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,843
to perform the most holy of rituals.

1260
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:24,693
Black mass.

1261
01:28:25,568 --> 01:28:28,235
(ominous music)

1262
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:44,403
A passage from the book
of Alistair Crowley

1263
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:51,290
speaks of how virgin blood is
the most blissful of nectars

1264
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,833
in the underworld.

1265
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,547
Tonight, we have a feast!

1266
01:29:03,496 --> 01:29:06,746
(Christine whimpering)

1267
01:29:23,587 --> 01:29:27,723
The cutting of young flesh,
the drinking of salty blood.

1268
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:29,538
The hunger.

1269
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:33,153
- [Shannon] Our father, who art in heaven.

1270
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,853
Hallowed be vthy name.

1271
01:29:38,034 --> 01:29:39,923
- Who dares!

1272
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:46,589
- Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

1273
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,963
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1274

(gunshot bangs)

1275
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,302
- Touch her and I'll blow
your ass off that rock, freak.

1276
01:29:56,303 --> 01:29:58,439
- You're a fool, Henson.

1277
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,519
There are too many of us.

1278
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,528
You don't stand a chance of living!

1279
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:04,029
(tense music)

1280
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,614
- Mistake.

1281
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:07,623
(gunshot bangs)

1282
01:30:07,624 --> 01:30:08,939
(gun clicks)

1283
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,649
- Got a couple more left.

1284
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,483
Who's next?

1285
01:30:15,401 --> 01:30:16,984
- [Man On Loudspeaker] You are surrounded.

1286
01:30:16,985 --> 01:30:19,859
Drop your weapons and step back.

1287
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,771
(tense music)

1288
01:30:21,772 --> 01:30:23,319
You are surrounded.

1289
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,876
Drop your weapons and step back.

01:30:25,877 --> 01:30:28,377
(tense music)

1291
01:30:36,277 --> 01:30:38,694
(man grunts)

1292
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,187

1293
01:31:07,689 --> 01:31:08,521
(gun clicks)

1294
01:31:08,522 --> 01:31:11,189

(Donovan grunts)

1296
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,875
(gun clicks)

1297
01:31:34,876 --> 01:31:35,708
- [Man On Loudspeaker] Drop your weapons

1298
01:31:35,709 --> 01:31:37,285
and put your hands in the air.

1299
01:31:37,286 --> 01:31:40,453
(helicopter whirring)

1300
01:31:45,669 --> 01:31:46,583
(Donovan laughs)

1301
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,290
- See you in hell.

1302
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:51,124
(water splashing)

1303
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:57,123
- Drop your gun!

1304
01:32:10,053 --> 01:32:13,803
(chattering on police radio)

1305
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,580
- Well, sir, this should just about do it.

1306
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,459
Wish I could have gotta pop at the guy.

1307
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,423
Sick bastard.

1308
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:49,619
Now don't you worry, sir.

1309
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,020
We'll take good care of her.

1310
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,434
And that's a promise.

1311
01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:56,018
(solemn music)

1312
01:33:02,793 --> 01:33:04,626
- Thank God it's over.

1313
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:07,463
- Thank you.

1314
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:12,453
- You can repay me by taking
us far, far away from here.

1315
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:20,231
- Bitch.

1316
01:33:20,232 --> 01:33:22,899

1317
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:27,892

(solemn music)

1319
01:33:32,781 --> 01:33:33,614

1320
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:44,337
(church bell ringing)

1321
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:01,360
(tense music)

(gun clicks)
(Christine whimpers)

1323
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:21,479
- Darkness was upon the face of the Earth.

1324
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,580
- Let her go, Donovan.

1325
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:27,003
- And God said to the fallen angel,

1326
01:34:27,937 --> 01:34:30,483
"upon your belly, you shall go,

1327
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:35,007
and dust you shall eat all
the days of your life."

1328
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:40,653
Here to join us for our
service, Mr. Henson?

1329
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:44,819
Oh, but please don't look
in the collection basket.

1330
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:47,092
You'll find your daughter's head inside.

1331
01:34:47,093 --> 01:34:48,288
- No!

1332
01:34:48,289 --> 01:34:50,789
(tense music)

1333
01:35:08,522 --> 01:35:11,189
(both grunting)

1334
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,983
- Your soul will soon
be immersed in flames,

1335
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:24,183
and your heart will burn an
agony at my lord's delight.

1336
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:29,343
Hell is calling, Mr. Henson.

1337
01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:32,699
(Paul grunts)

1338
01:35:37,138 --> 01:35:38,669
Henson.

1339
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:39,503
Henson!

1340
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,213
Help me, Henson.

1341
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:46,413
Your god is a god of
mercy, you must help me.

1342
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:49,383
My god does have mercy.

1343
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:51,520
But I don't.

1344
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:54,228
(ominous music)

1345
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:57,146
(blood squelching)

1346
01:36:06,598 --> 01:36:09,681
(solemn organ music)

1347
01:36:57,459 --> 01:36:59,959
(eerie music)

1348
01:37:06,015 --> 01:37:08,598
(gentle music)

1349
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:41,882
- [Whispering Voices] Hallelujah.

1350
01:38:41,883 --> 01:38:44,883
(suspenseful music)
