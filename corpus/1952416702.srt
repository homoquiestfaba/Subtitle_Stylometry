1
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,600
Turn!

2
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,410
Nodwick.

3
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,190
Stay here until we return!

4
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,160
Aye, my Lord

5
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,400
Mort Kemnon!

6
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,670
Uninvited guests...

7
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,820
Your reign of terror ends here!

8
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,530
By the light of Therin you shall fall!

9
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,810
What good is the light of your goddess?

10
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,960
She can not help you...

11
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,440
...here.

12
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,730
No...

13
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:08,810
We're...

14
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,330
...doomed.

15
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,710
Fastidian!

16
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,910
This does not end here!

17
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,810
Yes it does...for you.

18
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,780
Craaaaap!!

19
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,050
Was there a reason you didn't turn those ghouls?

20
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,690
Since that would've helped us...not die?

21
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,760
Guys...

22
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,170
Maybe you should have detected the trap, Cass. Green Mouse would be proud.

23
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,680
That was an AMBUSH, not a TRAP.

24
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,420
Even you should know the difference.

25
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,880
Oh by the way...way to defend the cleric there, Conan.

26
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,730
You lived..oh what...six seconds?

27
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,550
Real smart giving them clear path to the healer.

28
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,320
Look! Guys...

29
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,850
I didn't see you helping!

30
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,600
In fact, I saw you dying like a whiny little peasant!

31
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,430
Maybe I was dying...

32
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,490
...because our battle-dealer wasn't doing his job!

33
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,270
How am I supposed to kill everything in the room when I get flanked?

34
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,510
You are supposed to keep people of my ass

35
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,470
And you are supposed to keep healing me!

36
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,370
Which brings me to my lack of powers which I didn't have after I lost them!

37
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,550
Did I mention losing my powers?

38
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,190
GUYS!

39
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,890
And if he hadn't cut you off we totally would have had him

40
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,820
Yeah....I didn't even know it was possible cutting of a cleric of his god.

41
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,080
It's not....not in the core rules it isn't

42
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,490
It does fit the story!

43
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,510
It doesn't fit the rules!

44
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,300
Story trums rules!

45
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,020
Again with this argument...

46
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,660
Boss...we're down to our last copy of "Pizza Tattoo"

47
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,710
And of course I can't expect you

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,650
to know where we keep our products seeing as how you work for me

49
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,890
Argue on!!

50
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,180
What would you rather have?

51
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,610
A fantasy world with its own mysteries and pitfalls

52
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,930
...or...just another cookie cutter setting with no real surprises?

53
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,080
You should have told us that in your world the cleric could be cut off of his god!

54
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,170
Why should I told you that?

55
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,760
Gary... would you have played a cleric if you've known it's allowed to shut him down?

56
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,630
Hell no!

57
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,800
That's player knowledge, not character knowledge!

58
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,690
You know but your character wouldn't

59
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,010
That is so cheap! Cheap cheap cheap!

60
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,600
It is not cool to let a character advance that far and pull something that huge on him!

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,500
It was supposed to be a nasty surprise!

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,580
Something you weren't expecting

63
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,020
And because it was so unexpected the party died!

64
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,700
This is what happend when you mess with the rules!

65
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,170
What were you thinking?

66
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,220
Maybe....that it would force you to ROLE-PLAY!

67
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,250
What do you think we were doing??

68
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,090
Guys... come on!

69
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,990
Same time next week?

70
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,550
I'm good!

71
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,210
The new expansion for "Samurai Baseball" comes out next friday

72
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Looks very cool....you strike out you commit sapaku

73
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,490
No...we play this very game..

74
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,140
The same campaign?

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,780
We played it twice already?

76
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,220
You guys wanna do my campaign again?

77
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,530
No.

78
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,920
I have a reputation? There is no game on this shelves that can beat me!

79
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,480
So what kind of gamer would I be if I let some unpublished mod give the best of us?

80
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,360
Thanks, Cass. That's real...thoughful.

81
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,190
Hey, Mitch...

82
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,300
Hey...

83
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,370
Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick?

84
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,570
God...I don't know why that keeps happening?

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,910
Listen! We need two more players!

86
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,450
Dude.. I've got work in the morning!

87
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,450
No! Dick! For your campaign.

88
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,350
It's why we keep dying. We need a more well-rounded party.

89
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,060
Listen...it's only so much damaged three mad hombres can do, right?

90
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,410
Oh Cesar...didn't see that one coming did you?

91
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,940
Are you guys still gaming?

92
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,080
We're playing TimeValentin.

93
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,750
We need to go back through time and beat the crap out of historical figures

94
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,670
I totally butchered Abraham Lincoln.

95
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,400
Don't you have class in the morning?

96
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,350
Yeah. In like five hours? Why?

97
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,070
Take that Jesus!

98
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,090
Hey I gotta go...it's almost my turn
Take that Jesus!

99
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,070
Hey I gotta go...it's almost my turn

100
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,730
Who is the messiah now?

101
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,150
I'm never going to finish this freaking module!

102
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,170
Party died again?

103
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,510
They never try anything new and then they blame me when they die

104
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,220
Ungrateful munchkins!

105
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,130
I'm really kind of pissed off!

106
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,520
And that has nothing to do with your writers block?

107
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,490
I do not have writers block!

108
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,300
I know exactly how the story ends.

109
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,110
I just don't know how to get there.

110
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,130
Obviously neither do your players.

111
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,160
How am I supposed to finish a modules based on a adventure

112
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,040
...if we never finish the adventure?

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
Just run them through until they win...or your heads explodes.

114
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,920
We're gonna start all over again once we have a few new players

115
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,340
Mark.

116
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,750
Mark, why don't you join?

117
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,430
You used to game all the time in College!

118
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,100
I haven't gamed since the "incident"

119
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,080
Total party wipeout?

120
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,880
Like you couldn't even imagine.

121
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,620
Hey Cass.

122
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,710
Lodge.

123
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,990
Mark, I haven't seen you in a long time.

124
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,920
It's like I forgot you even exist.

125
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah...I get that a lot.

126
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,760
Ah... found one of the newbies!

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, do I know him?

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,500
Her.

129
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,980
Joanna keeps bugging me to get he involved..

130
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,610
..so I figured we make her a fighter. It's easy enough to play.

131
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,390
Joanna? Your ex Joanna?

132
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,310
She will be joining us?

133
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,240
Yes...finally!

134
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,360
What's wrong, Lodge?

135
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,750
Never played with a girl before?

136
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,730
See you scrubs tomorrow

137
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,580
Apparently we're leaving..

138
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,160
See you at Leo's...

139
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,990
..I'll try not to slow things down to much

140
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,470
Ohh... ehh... wait

141
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,920
Here. Player's Handbook. It's got all the rules. Everything you need to know.

142
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,840
Thanks, Kevin. I'll look it over

143
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,200
Who the hell is Kevin?

144
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,970
I am Kevin.

145
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,910
You have a first name?

146
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,280
Alright...what have you got?

147
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,350
Half-breed

148
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Kicking down the door..

149
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,920
Hey...alright that's everybody

150
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,030
Where is player number five?

151
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,380
There is no fifth player.

152
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,350
You said you're gonna get us another player, Lodge.

153
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,530
I asked 15 people..

154
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,730
..all regulars. Apparently we have a reputation!

155
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:33,230
What did I tell you? You make one eleven year old cry and they stop bugging you.

156
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,010
We still need another player!

157
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,660
I have taken care of it

158
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,230
Now...this is a mid-level campaign so we're starting at ninth level.

159
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,010
Here's Joanna's character.

160
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing?

161
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I made a character for you.

162
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,670
I wanna play my own character.

163
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,790
I know...that's why I made you one.

164
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,180
You think I can't make my own character?

165
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,970
Look...it's nothing personal.

166
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,870
You are going to be a fighter; there are some requirements you have to meet.

167
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,750
Like what?

168
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,670
A fighter has to be the strongest guy in the party.

169
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,910
Has to have a high armor class..

170
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,950
...and hitpoints out of the ass.

171
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,400
And that is what I made for you.

172
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,980
Let me see that!

173
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,220
Bikini mail?

174
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,480
Mmm...

175
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,240
What the hell is bikini mail?

176
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,010
Only the best armor you're allowed to wear.

177
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,410
There's a picture of it right here.

178
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,420
That looks like a ......

179
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,420
She fights with a broadsword?

180
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,210
"broad" sword

181
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,850
I get it. Kevin help me out here.

182
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,570
Kevin?

183
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,480
Wait..., your name is Kevin?

184
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,340
You have a first name?

185
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,700
Guys, if Joanna made a character she's gets to play it.

186
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,290
I agree with you on principle.. Kevin...

187
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,090
But she is new and I don't want her to die because she is inexperienced.

188
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,790
What makes you think that I'm gonna die?

189
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,280
History.

190
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,590
New guy always dies.

191
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,930
That is so true...

192
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,170
Hey you remember that one time those halfling pirates made him...

193
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,820
Shut up

194
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,040
Or the time that those gnome shopkeepers ambushed...

195
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,820
Shut up!

196
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,010
Or that asthmathic six year old princess...

197
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,010
SHUT UP!!

198
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,970
I flipped through that handbook....I got the jist of it...it doesn't seem that hard.

199
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,960
Okay....let's see your character then.

200
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,870
What's your strength bonus?

201
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,320
She doesn't have one.

202
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,180
Her highest stat is her intelligence

203
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,020
I've put other bonuses in dexterity and charisma.

204
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,350
Charisma?

205
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,580
WIIIIIIIIIII...

206
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,210
No strength bonus...

207
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,810
No constitution bonus...

208
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,940
How many hitpoints does she have?

209
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,230
Ah..let me see...45.

210
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,010
Ah...

211
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,920
45 hp.

212
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,050
A 9th level fighter with 45 hitpoints.

213
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,480
She's really gonna protect the party.

214
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,150
I put her other feats in speed and precision.

215
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,690
That's why intelligence is more important than strenght.

216
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,060
It would be if you were a wizard. But you're not.

217
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,010
You're a fighter....a fighter with a giant "kill me" sign on her back.

218
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,410
With her charisma she should be able to talk her way out of most fights.

219
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,610
What? Negotiation isn't your style?

220
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,090
Not exactly, no.

221
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,850
Our phylosophy is: "beat it until it stops moving"

222
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,990
...and then shoot it...

223
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,250
...and then step on its cadaver.

224
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,380
Calm down, Gary.

225
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,100
If you play this character you are going to die.

226
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,090
I spent 2 hours on this character and I'm gonna play her, okay?

227
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,820
Ok.

228
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,890
Ok.

229
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,000
And when you die you can play bikini babe.

230
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Fine.

231
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,060
Why did you two break up again?

232
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,760
Gary! Character?

233
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
I'm a wild mage. WILD!!

234
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,570
But you loser can call me sorceress.

235
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,020
Yes, that's right. I'm playing a chic!

236
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,630
Dude, you're hot?

237
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,100
17 Charisma

238
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,200
Wanna have sex?

239
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,120
Totally.

240
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,210
Awesome! I seduce him....her.

241
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,040
Yes! I can totally seduce any homophobe with that roll.

242
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,710
We haven't started yet!

243
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,510
You guys haven't met.

244
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,010
Alright

245
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,830
Bone me later.

246
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,190
I'll be waiting, man meat.

247
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,570
After we've started please..

248
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,370
Leo, I assume you are playing a fighter again?

249
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,990
Actually I'm going as bard.

250
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,780
Really? That is....bit of a jump for you. You only played fighters before.

251
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,050
How different can they be?

252
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,460
I'm playing a monk.

253
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,340
What's he gonna do? Copy manuscripts?

254
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,840
Think "Kung Fu Monk", grasshopper.

255
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,320
Oh, that doesn't seem to fit, does it?

256
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,740
No, it doesn't

257
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,700
I told you guys that there are no monks in my world.

258
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,770
And I told you that if we're playing by 3rd edition rules I can play any

259
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,430
basic character class.....and monk....

260
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,980
...is a basic character class.

261
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,570
I based my world on a fantasized western medieval period

262
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,530
There were no "kung fu monks" in western europe.

263
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,380
If Joanna can play a character that she wants,

264
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,730
I can play any character that I want.

265
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,180
I'm asking to play a basic character class

266
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,200
...and you're blocking me.

267
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,600
You're breaking the rules...again.

268
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,690
I play a monk or I don't play.

269
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,340
And they don't play.

270
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,970
- I play.  - No, you don't!

271
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,900
Yes, I do.

272
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,250
Fine. You can play a monk. But he's got to fit the world.

273
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,150
He has got to be a western monk...

274
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,110
...occidental.

275
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,550
- You think you can handle that?  - Of course.

276
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,070
Good
- You think you can handle that?  - Of course.

277
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,500
Good

278
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,450
Now is there anything else?

279
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,340
- No, that's it.   - Alright.

280
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,950
Oh, I'm also playing an elf.

281
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,930
What? No, you're not.

282
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,180
Yeah, yeah thats right.

283
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,540
I told you guys that this is an all human campaign.

284
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,960
There are no elves in my world.

285
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,520
And I told you that "elf" is a basic character race and...

286
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,550
..and since we're playing by the rules..

287
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,840
ADVENTURE STARTING! ADVENTURE.

288
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,990
We begin in the throne room where three of you have answered

289
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,110
the summons to the king.

290
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,970
His royal majesty "Erasmus, the randomly bias"

291
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,710
There is a great evil in our land

292
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,400
The vile necromancer, Mort Kemnon.

293
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,040
Daily his power grows stronger

294
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,780
and yet it appears that our goddess has forsaken us

295
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,240
...for she answers not our prayers.

296
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,040
Now can I seduce her?

297
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,700
In the middle of the throne room?

298
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,230
Why not? We started!

299
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,500
Mort Kemnon has discovered an evil artifact.

300
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,700
A cursed item known as the "Mask of Death".

301
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,970
Find him and kill him!

302
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,430
Bring me this mask...

303
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,090
so that its evil may not spread across our land.

304
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,640
Flofenrest...

305
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,200
...the staff!

306
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,760
I present to you this "Staff of Ressurection".

307
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,660
If one of your party should fall during the quest..

308
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,680
...it need not be their end.

309
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,840
Go forth noble heroes.

310
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,550
May Therin light your way.

311
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,870
Go forth noble heroes.

312
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,340
May Therin light your way.

313
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,100
The city is near to bursting with a flood of refugees.

314
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,070
You hear mutters of Mort Kemnon as they shuffle toward the safety of the castle.

315
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,760
Corn, sellery, oranges...

316
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,120
Fresh bread..

317
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,120
Onions.

318
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,000
Cabbages...the finest cabbages in the land.

319
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,760
I wanna talk to the farmer.

320
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,040
Why?

321
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,980
Well...if he is from out of town he might be able to tell us where the evil wizard is.

322
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,410
That's a great idea...

323
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,120
Thanks!

324
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,090
...for that it sucks.

325
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,650
There is no way that he knows where he is.

326
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,680
Why not?

327
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,540
He's a random NPC.

328
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,200
And as we all now my NPCs are "cardboard cut outs".

329
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,350
NPC?

330
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,430
Non player character.

331
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
Oh, right.

332
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,000
Which of course I'm supposed to know.

333
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,980
Don't worry, we don't need anything from him. We know where we're going.

334
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,260
No, you don't!

335
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,450
We've done the adventure twice before...

336
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,900
...we need to go to the mountains.

337
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,260
Your characters don't know where to go.

338
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,490
Are you saying that there's not an adventure hook in the...

339
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,310
Yes.

340
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,940
No, it's beside the point.

341
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,880
And the point? He's beside the mountains...off we go.

342
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,450
I still wanna talk to him. It's what my character would do.

343
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,230
How long have you been in town my friend?

344
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,840
Oh...scarcly a day, my lady.

345
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,480
There are goblins in the mountains you should know.

346
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,680
Boring!

347
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,900
Have you heard anything....strange in your travels?

348
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,490
Rumors about where Mort Kemnon might be?

349
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,520
I believe the adventure is that way!

350
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,400
Aye...those mountains look quest-worthy.

351
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,920
The sooner you tell me what you know...

352
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,180
...the sooner you can safely return to your land.

353
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,350
Well..it may be nothing but I heard that things were not right in...

354
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,600
¡Ahhhhhhhhh!

355
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,800
What the hell did you just cast?

356
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,100
Flaming hand of fiery doom!

357
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,000
On a farmer?

358
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,520
You cast a 4th level spell on a 0th level peasant?

359
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,020
Yeah!

360
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,920
Waffles!!

361
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,790
Totally!

362
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,960
That spell is for killing demons.

363
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,190
I'm lawful good. Am I morally obliged to kill him?

364
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,040
What the hell were you thinking?

365
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,870
I was just trying to get on with the story.

366
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,300
How are we supposed to trust you?

367
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,600
We've just met and the first thing you do..after boinking a stranger...

368
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
...in the presence of the king...is to murder a peasant because you were bored??

369
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,890
I'm chaotic neutral! I'm just playing my alignment.

370
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,500
......That was a decidedly evil act.

371
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,420
You know I think I am morally oblieged to kill him now.

372
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,610
One more of those and I'm shifting your alignment to chaotic evil.

373
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,990
Got it?

374
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,410
Got it!

375
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,590
How much experience do I get for the farmer?

376
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,510
Gary? Are you forgetting something?

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,740
Oh...you got some peasant on your face.

378
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,850
Like what?

379
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,070
Hail...Flynn the fine.

380
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,360
Hail, random creepy knife guy.

381
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,350
Dumbass...bardic knowledge?

382
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,580
Oh, right... you are totally...

383
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,270
The lord high inquisitor.

384
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,890
Lord high inquisitor.

385
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,130
Of the grand illuminated holy order of Therin

386
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,460
....what he said

387
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,550
Hail!

388
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,580
The hierophant begs an audience.

389
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,890
Listen...if this is about that farmer..

390
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,040
...I totally thought he was a demon.

391
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,240
Follow us!

392
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,070
No, no...seriously...

393
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,340
He was talking about..like there was a hellgate in one of those things.

394
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,250
Seriously...I know it was in here somewhere. He had the horns and the fangs...

395
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,840
and then he said he was going to pee fire on us.

396
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,990
I had no choice...I didn't think...it was like this...

397
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,040
And I'm pretty sure he was eating a baby...

398
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,020
It was pretty awful...

399
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,260
Wooow... ehhh... we should take these.

400
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,730
The inquisitor leads you into the heart of the cathedral

401
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,310
...where the grand hierophant of Therin himself awaits you.

402
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,630
I gotta thank you for meeting with us..

403
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,900
...before you continue your journey.

404
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,220
It is our honor, your grace.

405
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,960
What is that?

406
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,080
The heart of Therin.

407
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,920
Legend says the gem is composed of solid light.

408
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,490
Could I steal it?

409
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,060
Well...considering that it's one of the holyiest symbols of the church

410
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,190
..and that the cathedral is swarming with paladins that would most likely be suicide.

411
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,860
Go ahead!

412
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,860
What is that heavenly music?

413
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,370
The hymnth of Therin...it calls to our goddess.

414
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,340
I seduce the priestess!

415
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,020
She's taken a vow of celibacy.

416
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,530
Dude...20 ranks in seduction!

417
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,820
Hey baby...wanna tune my mandoline?

418
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,270
Please understand...the horny bard does not represent us.

419
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,420
There are those who say that Therin has abandoned us in this dark time.

420
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,590
Rest assured she watches us always.

421
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,900
Nevertheless, we shall send two of our own order to ensure your safety.

422
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:13,730
Brother Silence, a most stubborn monk...who's NOT an elf.

423
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,560
And Sir Osric the Chased, our most noble paladin.

424
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh great...a babysitter.

425
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,430
You have got to be kidding me.

426
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,630
Lodge, you are such a douche.

427
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,600
Sir Osric will assure that you never stray the paths of goodness and law.

428
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,960
You strike out for the mountains.

429
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,490
The road winds high through the foothills

430
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,170
and after a day you've reached the foot of the pass.

431
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,740
At the edge of a thick forest a sign catches your eye.

432
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,050
After a few hours you come to a clearing in the pass.

433
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,430
In the middle stands a twisted goblin totem.

434
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,900
Perhaps we could sneak around?

435
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,480
Not a chance...it's a trap.

436
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,580
Not nece...

437
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,640
Not necessarily.

438
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,750
It's always a trap.

439
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,100
Doubtless, the goblins are merely waiting for an excuse

440
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,910
What are you doing?

441
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,430
Where did you get that tomato?

442
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,040
Hello? I'm a bard.

443
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,400
I got your "gaga".

444
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,410
Is this wise?

445
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,940
Are you trying to kill us?

446
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,380
You know...I believe this is a totem to a goblin god.

447
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,780
Oh really? What kind of god?

448
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,000
A god of the moon, I believe.

449
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,210
A god of the moon you say?

450
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:02,720
Indeed, I do.

451
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,060
Well, how do you worship a god of the moon?

452
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,720
Ah, with my cute little tuschi.

453
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,340
They're so angry.

454
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,660
Oh, I wonder why. We only farted on god.

455
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,140
Perhaps we can negotiate?

456
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,160
Don't worry! I got it.

457
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,210
I totally pacify them with bardic music.

458
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,220
# Dear goblin friends# Dear goblin friends #

459
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,540
# Please hear my song #

460
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,500
Yeah....

461
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,190
...you're dead.

462
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,980
In 29 minutes and 42 seconds.

463
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,770
New personal best, Leo.

464
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,850
There's so many place I can stick that stuff on you...

465
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,450
Alright, everybody roll "inish".

466
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,150
Initiative.

467
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,330
Oh, right. To see who goes first.

468
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,960
I roll one of these thingis and add my dex bonus plus 4.

469
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,060
No, just your dex bonus.

470
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,900
No, I also get +4. That's what "improved initiative" does, right?

471
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,020
Who takes improved initiative?

472
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,470
Ok, order...

473
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,330
Joanna, Cass, Gary, Osric, then goblins.

474
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,740
What about me?

475
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,640
You're dead.

476
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:47,520
Ok... so I take one of these and add my attack bonus and....

477
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,500
You get another attack.

478
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,280
I do??

479
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,530
You took first strike. When you go first and drop an opponent you immediately get another attack.

480
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,960
Cool

481
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,080
Criticial!

482
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,420
I get another attack.

483
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,480
Expanded critical, critical momentum and precise strike.

484
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,600
You see, I add my INT and DEX bonuses to my crit range

485
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,720
...and I get an extra attack every time I land a critical hit.

486
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,500
What's your critical range?

487
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,030
Let's see...13 to 20, without bonuses.

488
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,870
Holy Craping Christ!

489
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,910
Critical!

490
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,910
Critical!

491
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,580
Five foot step.

492
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,430
Critical!

493
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,940
Cass, you're up.

494
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,950
Gary.

495
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,890
Lightning bolt.

496
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,050
That will go off in 2 rounds.

497
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,700
What? Why?

498
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,020
Wild magic, Sex bomb.

499
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,030
Flinn pulls Elazarus.

500
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,830
and... goblins.

501
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,000
The goblins surround Daphne.

502
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,000
Joanna?

503
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,660
Hold my action.

504
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,860
Cass...

505
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,280
Move to assist Daphne...

506
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,160
...twice

507
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,760
I'm here to protect you.

508
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,320
My hero.

509
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,040
Now?

510
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,520
No, Gary.

511
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,110
Osric uses the staff on Flinn.

512
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,800
# Sing it! Give it to me...all you can...

513
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,030
# 'cause you're all dead....that's right!

514
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,360
That's who takes improved initiative.

515
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,390
Yeah...but can you...(???)

516
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,080
Oh, and your spell goes off.

517
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,810
Crap!

518
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,690
So.....how much experience do I get for the bard?

519
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,830
After the battle in goblins pass...

520
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,020
...you resurrect Flinn yet again and press through the mountains.

521
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,420
Night has fallen by the time you reach the tiny village on the other side of the range.

522
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,250
Is the barmaid hot?

523
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,470
Yes....must you?

524
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,550
Yes, I must...

525
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,320
I wanna seduce her next.

526
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,660
Hey baby! My spells require some magic components.

527
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,060
Dude...you're a chick!

528
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,990
Oh...right

529
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,910
How embarrasing.

530
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,070
We should not draw attention to ourselves

531
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,610
Agreed. We should mute our presents. We don't know how might be watching.

532
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,480
Indeed! Only in hiding ones identity..

533
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,280
...can one truly be known.

534
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,040
I'm sorry. There is no rooms for you tonight.

535
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,460
Nonsense! Your inn is empty. There is plenty of room for us.

536
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,790
The room is not a problem, truthfully. The problem -

537
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,490
Truthfully....you are not welcome here!!

538
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,470
Mort Agrippa!

539
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,410
You are most certainly not welcome here!

540
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,920
Introduction would seem in order.

541
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,690
I am the governer of this town...

542
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,980
...and you are trespassing on these lands!

543
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,460
These lands belong to the king.

544
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,890
These lands belong to MY king!

545
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,570
Mort Kemnon.

546
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:35,340
Yes! And soon you will serve him as I do!

547
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,480
Beyond the veil of death!

548
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,560
Gary, you're held. Leo you're in.

549
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,570
Fear not! I have returned.

550
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,820
Dash it old man. Help us!

551
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,800
I am!

552
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,410
Turn!

553
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,230
Is that the one that kicked me in the face?

554
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,020
Yeah. Why?

555
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,280
Just asking.

556
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,370
I am Mort Agrippa.

557
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,060
You see...I control Zombie-Ninjas.

558
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,440
Are they "Zinjas"?\ Are they "Nombis"?

559
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,990
I don't know.

560
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,560
Mort Agrippa ain't going nowhere.

561
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,980
Oh... monks you have a problem with but... hey...ninjas are ok.

562
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,620
Tell us where Mort Kemnon is!

563
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,710
Do your worst! Kill me if you must! I will never tell.

564
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,120
Gosch... we'll have to torture him.

565
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,140
Oh... dark!

566
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,000
You'll have to think of something else...

567
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,300
Torture is dishonorable. Osric won't allow it.

568
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,190
God, I love paladins!

569
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,190
Can't you just step outside for a while?

570
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,550
Actually no. Paladins can't let evil things happen if they know about them.

571
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,060
It's his alignment.

572
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,790
Yeah, they're lawful stupid.

573
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,690
I'll distract him. I'll tell him that there's a ninja outside.

574
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,150
I seriously doubt he will fall for that.

575
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,840
Normally the dice decide that sort of thing.

576
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,860
Look Sir Osric, an evil-do'er outside.

577
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,380
What?

578
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,370
Show yourself, villain! Thou can not escape my justice!

579
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,280
Come forward so that I may smite thy with my mighty blade!

580
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,760
The truth shall descend upon thy wickedness as an angel of righteous fury!

581
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,600
Deceivers! This ends now!

582
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,220
He's over there!

583
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,040
Thou shall die a thousand deaths shadow spawn!

584
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,230
I shall lay down my justice upon thy lonesome brow
Thou shall die a thousand deaths shadow spawn!

585
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:58,100
I shall lay down my justice upon thy lonesome brow

586
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,880
What happened here?

587
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,300
Ehh... funny story...

588
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,210
...strangest thing! Eh...he...

589
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:31,850
...he tripped .. and on the way down beat himself to death.

590
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,300
Yes.

591
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,550
Did he say where Mort Kemnon was?

592
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,280
Not as such...no..

593
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,950
Did you find that evil-do'er?

594
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,610
He escaped.

595
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,220
My shame knows no bounds.

596
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,410
Yeah...you suck!

597
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,720
Flinn, what did the barmaid say?

598
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,470
Oh, yes...oh yes.

599
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh, gods....yes!

600
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,440
About Mort Kemnon, dumbass.

601
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,510
The barmaid says Mort Agrippa came from West Haven.

602
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,270
Following her advice you abandon the inn and take the road to the east.

603
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,500
You put some good miles between yourself and the town

604
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,210
.. before you camp for the night a few miles outside of West Haven.

605
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,100
Hi.

606
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,860
You know...you're unlike any other woman I've ever met.

607
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,880
Right back at you...

608
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,070
So fast...so strong. Like steel wrapped in silk.

609
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,650
A man could loose himself in those eyes...

610
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:59,770
A man could, yes. But apparently I must remind you that you are a woman.

611
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,810
Of course I am...

612
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,300
I don't supposed you're interested in a little girl on girl a---

613
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,220
You don't really wanna finish that thought, do you?

614
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,290
I'll take that as a "no".

615
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,010
Good girl.

616
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,670
Tell me minstrel....what do you know of this Mort Kemnon?

617
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,160
He is a servant of death. An enemy of the light.

618
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,110
And that is all I can tell you.

619
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,420
And...the mask of death?

620
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,950
The god of oblivion wore the mask when..

621
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,910
...the creator forged the world.

622
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,530
It is said that whoever wears the mask gains the power of the god he serves.

623
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,710
Then Mort Kemnon has all the powers of death?

624
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,270
How could Therin allow this?

625
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,360
Maybe beyond her control.

626
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:10,520
Before we left the Hierophant told us that Therin is missing.

627
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,970
Missing?

628
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,750
Trapped.

629
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,960
How could this be?

630
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,900
I have no idea.

631
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,110
Actually, I do!

632
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,820
Bardic knowledge!!

633
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,270
Thank you!

634
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,830
Long ago, young Jack Lightfinger stole beauty from the mermaids.

635
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,990
The lord of the sea was angry and sent his waves to drown jack.

636
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,800
But Jack was too clever. He led the seaking inland..

637
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,360
..stretching out the waves which sucked!

638
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,240
...OUT the seakings power as there was not enough water to drown Jack.

639
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,420
Then Jack trapped the god of the sea in a prison of ice

640
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:11,430
..and...
Then Jack trapped the god of the sea in a prison of ice

641
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,470
..and...

642
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,060
What's that word?

643
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,850
Ransom.

644
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,970
...and ransomed him back to the merfolk.

645
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,190
Boring!

646
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:25,130
Interesting, but what exactly does this have to do with Therin?

647
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:33,280
The only way to trap a deity is in a prison of that gods own element.

648
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:39,800
Indeed! The four elements...like man alone...are weak.

649
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,880
..but together they form the strong fifth element.

650
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,770
Boredom!

651
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,460
We should go to bed soon. Morning is coming.

652
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,910
We must get our rest if we're to find Mort Kemnon.

653
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,460
And what if I shall find you first?

654
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,160
Abandon this road or die on it!

655
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,970
Save your threats! You have no power here.

656
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,110
As if killing the bard impresses us.

657
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,240
You shall never obtain the mask of death.

658
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,650
We do not fear you.

659
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,890
Then you are greater fools than you appear.

660
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,940
You sound afraid.

661
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,630
You don't believe me? Then come...come and face Drazuul.

662
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,090
And I think we call it there for the night.

663
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,400
What? It's still early.

664
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,600
It's after two.

665
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,720
It's what? I had no idea it was so late.

666
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,600
See? See what happens? You get so into it you loose track of time.

667
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,960
Yeah...it's like surfing the internet for porn..litical commentary.

668
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,320
Nice dodge, Gary.

669
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,490
Thanks! Same time next week?

670
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,650
Ah, can't ... do it here.

671
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,820
We're having a .... turning.

672
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,970
We could do it at my place. I've got plenty of space.

673
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,220
Right on!

674
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,270
If this is about this farmer, I totally thought he was a demon.

675
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,650
That was awesome!

676
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,240
Onward....to waffles!!

677
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,890
WAFFLES!

678
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,880
They did good, so they get waffles.

679
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,440
Glad that I could be of assistance.

680
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,280
Have you kept writing since college?

681
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,150
Ahh... sort of.

682
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,420
What does "sort of" mean?

683
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,140
I don't write as often as I should.

684
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,080
Ah...

685
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,900
I've got the story, I just don't know how to write it.

686
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,000
Try paper....and pencil.

687
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,310
Paper...

688
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,090
Wow... I think...I..

689
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,150
Is it this story that we're playing?

690
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,240
Ehhh... yeah.

691
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,350
Really?

692
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,820
So I'm in your story.

693
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,060
Eh... yeah, yeah.

694
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,850
Never been somebody's story before....IN someone's story.

695
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,150
Well, you know....I guess in a way we're all in a story.

696
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,750
I guess that's true..

697
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,700
No, all I'm saying is that maybe it would be easier..

698
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,560
..if you didn't decide how thing are gonna end before you start.

699
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,540
Eh...

700
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:38,650
What?

701
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,510
What is wrong with that?

702
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,870
If I don't keep them focused on the story..

703
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:48,100
..they are just going to run around looting, killing and impregnating my entire world.

704
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,810
I've got to keep them under control.

705
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,170
That's why they don't trust you!

706
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,950
THEY don't trust ME?

707
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,250
No.

708
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,080
They're the one who try to kill people before they have a chance to speak.

709
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,940
They know you don't trust them to play your way

710
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,340
It's why you keep them on such a short leash, it's why you dropped a policeman in the middle...

711
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,980
Paladin...

712
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,060
Whatever.

713
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,590
...to keep tabs on them.

714
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,080
It's no wonder they screw with you.

715
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,490
You're a good enough storyteller to handle whatever they throw at you.

716
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,860
Just let the story evolve...naturally.

717
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,630
The ending might even surprise you.

718
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,200
Alright. I'll...ah...see what I can do.

719
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,770
Alright...you'll do that.

720
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,630
Good night, Kevin.

721
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,990
Good night.

722
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,410
Where the hell did I park?

723
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,190
Hey, Mitch.

724
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,690
Hey.

725
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:11,860
Did you let the cat in?

726
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,720
We have a cat?

727
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,250
Yeah...time for bed.

728
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,410
Mr. Wample? Are you paying attention?

729
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,160
Oh god, yes!

730
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,330
How many of these do you actually need?

731
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,660
Let me answer that with another question:

732
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,890
Shut up!!

733
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,290
Your boss is a dick!

734
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,270
- Ogre. 29 hitpoints. Dark and light vision

735
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,210
Low reflexes.

736
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,950
Troll.

737
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,160
63 hitpoints. Regenerates 5 hp per round.

738
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,210
Weak agains fire and acid.

739
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:38,830
Stone giant.

740
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,670
200 hp. Breathes underwater.

741
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,220
Immune to electricity.

742
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,610
That's storm giant!

743
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,750
Morning, Steve.

744
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,060
Morning, Brian.

745
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:57,880
Morning, Ed.

746
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,520
Morning, captain.

747
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,230
Get him!

748
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,470
What's the purpose of this game again?

749
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,840
Eh...to deliver 10 pizzas before the other ninja.

750
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,220
Ok, that I can deal with.

751
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,940
What's with the pirates?

752
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:05,000
Everything is better with pirates!

753
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:14,670
Hi guys.

754
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,580
Hey, Lodge.

755
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,550
Lodge, can I bring in a new character?

756
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,820
Another bard?

757
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,300
What's wrong with Flinn? Besides from....dying?

758
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,800
I permantly loose a level everytime I'm ressurected.

759
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,240
I'm like at 4th level. He's almost not worth playing.

760
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:40,780
Ok. Point. Yeah sure...if you die go ahead and bring in a new guy.

761
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,150
Thanks, Lodge.

762
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,310
Hello Mr. Kitty. You can't be here.

763
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,550
I believe we left off a few miles outside of Westhaven.

764
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,300
Hey, Mitch.

765
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,130
Everybody make a listen check.

766
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,510
If you succeed you awake to a strange wrestling sound.

767
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,680
A scruffy looking peasant is rumaging through your gear.

768
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,290
I waste him with my crossbow!

769
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,180
This man has stolen from us. He must be punished!

770
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,070
Mercy! Mercy, good sirs!

771
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,010
I'm a woman, you fool!

772
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,810
What do you have against peasants, murderous troll?

773
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,070
Just a general...(????).....

774
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,980
Mercy, good Masters! Please don't kill me.

775
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,350
I'll try and calm him.

776
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,620
# Shut up dear peasant..

777
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,540
# Rest your head..

778
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:48,610
# Or I will let the sorceress kill your ass dead

779
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,180
Amazingly, the peasant is no longer paniced.
# Or I will let the sorceress kill your ass dead

780
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,630
Amazingly, the peasant is no longer paniced.

781
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,790
Rise! You have nothing to fear.

782
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,810
Forgive me masters. I haven't had anything to eat in days.

783
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,710
Then join us for breakfast.

784
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,330
Bard, firewood!

785
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,480
What is your name, peasant?

786
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,990
Crap....I didn't give him one...ehhh....I'll guess we'll call him...

787
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,340
Willem, my lady.

788
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,020
I live in Westhaven....at least I did until...

789
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,360
Until what?

790
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,990
Mort Kemnon's priests....they....they killed all the others.

791
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,040
I'm the only one left.

792
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,730
Do you know where Mort Kemnon is?

793
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,560
No, my lord. Only the fiend knows that.

794
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,740
The fiend?

795
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,710
Drazuul.

796
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,040
He led the purges.

797
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,490
It's....I rather not speak of it.

798
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,330
Do you know where we can find him? This... Drazuul?

799
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,270
In Westhaven. The centre of town.

800
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,410
But I'm not going back there.

801
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,180
Well, then let us cloth and feed you..

802
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,290
..and send you safely on your way.

803
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,500
Time out!

804
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,810
We do no have enough provisions to feed a nameless NPC.

805
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,560
He's not nameless..

806
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,450
...his name is Willem.

807
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,250
We got what we want from him. Let's just leave him.

808
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,540
Osric is morally compelled to help him.

809
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,280
He can't knowingly allow him to continue suffering.

810
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:13,500
And I can't knowingly allow you to deplete our resources because you wanna feel noble.

811
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,240
I'm just playing his alignment.

812
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,750
It's what our characters would do.

813
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,250
If you have a problem find some way to solve it..

814
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,270
...in character.

815
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,240
Ok.

816
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,630
Let's roleplay for this..

817
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,080
Sir Osric, a word.

818
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,150
Of course, brother Silence.

819
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,470
Let's say I have two sons...

820
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,200
...one strong, the other weak..

821
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,870
..both wish for schooling...

822
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,150
...but I can only send one.

823
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,670
Whom do I choose?

824
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,420
The strong boy could go far with such schooling

825
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,720
Yet the boy who is weak in body may find that he is strong in mind.

826
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,100
I would consider...

827
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,840
That's it! That's really it!

828
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,410
I will smite thee, evildo'er!

829
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,160
How long until he moves?

830
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,990
Ten...maybe twenty seconds.

831
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:26,510
I cast Amnesia on Osric.

832
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,860
Osric has no memory of the last two minutes.

833
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,500
Nice dodge, Gary.

834
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,600
I've got firewood.

835
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:49,150
You find the tiny hamlet of Westhaven abandoned.

836
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,150
Your skins begins to crawl the farther you press.

837
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,910
Have Osric detect evil.

838
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:56,170
Overwhelming evil in the centre of town.

839
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,560
We'll investigate.

840
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,680
What the hell is that?

841
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,900
A death demon... one of death's personal servants and he is looking your way.

842
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,620
Come...

843
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,270
Come to Drazuul.

844
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,350
Why didn't I get a save?

845
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,450
It's a death demon.  It's fear aura is too strong.

846
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,330
You can't roll a successful save.

847
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:35,910
Incorrect.

848
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:37,720
What is your WILL-save modifier?

849
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,220
+9.

850
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,600
The DC to beat this demons fear aura is a 32.

851
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,900
You would have to roll a 23 on a 20-sided die in order to succeed.

852
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:50,370
Now I don't have a math degree but that's impossible, isn't it?

853
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,870
A natural 20 is an automatic success no matter the circumstance.

854
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:54,710
You only have a 5 percent chance of rolling that 20.

856
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:57,710
Do I at least get that roll? I mean it's in the rules.

Do I at least get that roll? I mean it's in the rules.

858
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:03,710
Or is it okay if we play by the rules? Is that alright with you?

859
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,320
A fumble!!

860
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:18,200
That means you're completely compelled and I get to control your character..

861
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,880
...until you snap out of it.

862
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,920
Since we're playing by the rules I know you don't mind.

863
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,260
Oh shut up, Kevin.

864
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,060
Kneel, slave!

865
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,420
Yes, my master.

866
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,870
I would never say that.

867
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,940
Please, let me play my character.

868
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:45,510
My body and will are yours to defile, my master.

869
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:03,210
My lady...you tempt me. The evil in your heart and your beauty is unsurpassed.

870
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:06,340
I'm not evil, I'm chaotic neutral.

871
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,800
You shall be my new bride and concubine.

872
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,250
I hate to be the one to tell you this...

873
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,800
...but I'm not...

874
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,660
Crap! I'm a woman.

875
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:21,250
My dear...what is a wedding without guests?

876
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,310
Kiss me, my darling.

877
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,160
After five minutes there is no sign of the others.

878
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,330
We go in after them.

879
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,920
Five bucks says you're dead again.

880
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,980
You're on, assjackal.

881
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:01,930
Master! More slaves for the lust pits.

882
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,030
You, hellboy! Turn!

883
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,220
Luster, run!

884
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,700
Compelled here, thank you.

885
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,390
My music will save you. Counter song!

886
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,530
Yeah, he's pissed!

887
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:48,770
New character.

888
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,710
Eh... sure.

889
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,610
Welcome to the party. We're all going to die.

890
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,360
That's a defeatist attitude.

891
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,750
Perhaps you can tell me how we're gonna slay a demon when..

892
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,450
..our wizard wasted his demon frying spell on a peasant?

893
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,960
You thought this was a great idea.

894
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,860
Why can't he just cast another?

895
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,360
Because it takes 8 hours of rest to regain spells and that's with no distractions.

896
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,510
I activate "Arcane Recollection".

897
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,320
Which does...???

898
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:29,060
At the cost of two spell slots I can regain any spell previously cast in ten rounds.

899
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,240
Assuming you can concentrate.

900
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,270
Well, then it falls to the rest of the party to protect me.

901
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,080
Osric lays hands on Silence.

902
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,800
Keep it down! I can't concentrate.

903
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,930
My music will help.

904
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,640
- How many of those do you've got?     - 50.

905
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,010
I can do this all night.

906
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,690
Never fear. Flinn is here.

907
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:24,850
Quiver in fear for I....noooo....Mommy!

908
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,330
Evil-do'ers, prepare to die!

909
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,010
Don't distract me...I'm almost done.

910
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,230
Avast ye...

911
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:45,180
I'm gonna die....

912
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,160
Why hasn't Drazuul moved?

913
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,250
Good question! Spot check.

914
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:51,740
The demon is trapped in the pentagram!
Good question! Spot check.

915
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,460
The demon is trapped in the pentagram!

916
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,020
Now we have him!

917
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,010
There are 37 more of me, asshole!

918
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,740
Darling....prepare to receive the flaming hand of fiery doom!

919
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:36,230
Marvelous! It's a party and everyone's invited! It's just we get the hell out of here.

920
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,290
What about the spell?

921
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:38,260
No good.

922
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:43,650
Drazuul moves before me and blasts me unless I have a barricade or something.

923
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,670
Hide behind the mountain of dead bards!

924
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,600
I have to stand up to cast. I'm going to be a sitting duck.

925
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,090
I've got your back!

926
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,480
What happened to "Hand of Doom"?

927
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,170
He was expecting that. I used a hold spell instead. That way we can question him.

928
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:28,990
Well played, Gary!

929
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:29,630
Where is your master?
Well played, Gary!

930
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,160
Where is your master?

931
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,490
Sir Osric...

932
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,270
Can you bless this water?
Sir Osric...

933
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,120
Can you bless this water?

934
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,100
This flask is now full of holy water.

935
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,880
Tell us what we wanna know or I'll give you a bath.

936
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:53,190
Your treat is empty! A paladin cannot stand by while torture takes place.

937
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:57,480
Eh...

938
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,800
My...what fine yet rustic architecture.

939
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,520
I think I will examine it more closely.

940
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,590
Where is your master?

941
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,500
The paladin can always bless more water.

942
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,960
Didn't we pass a lake on the way here?

943
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,410
The mines!

944
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,220
You'll find the entrance in the mines.

945
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,540
And how do we defeat him?

946
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,040
The book! His power is in the book.

947
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,930
But this is not the power you need to fear...your real enemy is...

948
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,340
Thank you! You've been most helpful.

949
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,580
Ah...one more thing.

950
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,950
A noble waffle for the paladin.

951
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,430
I feel dirty...

952
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,010
You follow an overgrown trail out of town.

953
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:00,100
The trail winds towards an omnious looking mine set into the foot of the mountains.

954
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,820
At the entrance to the mine there are stairs that plunge far underground

955
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,590
The initial hallway leads deep into the darkness.

956
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:13,750
The light from your torches seems to shy away from the dark.

957
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:20,330
Alright! Mark your spots.

958
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,660
Nodwick? You're still alive?

959
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,110
Nodwick? Who's Nodwick?

960
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,380
Henchman...from our last campaign.

961
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,710
Really? Cool!

962
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:02,530
How long has he been here?

963
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:02,640
In game time? Ah...about two months.
How long has he been here?

964
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,740
In game time? Ah...about two months.

965
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,050
You guys left him here all alone?

966
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,580
Well...being dead we had little choice.

967
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,920
There is no way he's still alive after 8 weeks.

968
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:17,240
You've left 3 months worth of provisions in that chest of holding along with everything else.

969
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:24,520
Everything else?

970
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,130
Our gear!!

971
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,420
Nodwick, don't you recognize us? It's me, Fastidian.

972
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,770
Why are you wearing a dress?

973
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:35,210
What?

974
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,840
Oh, yeah...right.

975
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,010
We've come to retreive our goods. It's us...your former masters.

976
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:50,830
Hang on a minute. You're not my former masters.

977
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,330
You're completely different characters being played by the same players.

978
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:58,360
Nodwick has no idea who your new characters are.

979
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:58,540
I have never seen you before in my life.
Nodwick has no idea who your new characters are.

980
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,440
I have never seen you before in my life.

981
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,270
Shove off!

982
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,650
Sorry to bother you, Sir.

983
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:08,300
It's us, Nodwick. Tuk, Rennard... all of us.

984
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,600
Weren't you a man just a second ago?

985
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,160
I have another spell...

986
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,700
No wait! I'll charm him...

987
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,190
Well....

988
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:39,900
Given that my former masters are more than likely dead..

989
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,230
..I suppose you can have what's in the chest.

990
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:44,810
But I get to carry it.

991
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,450
Done.

992
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:47,920
and done.

993
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,730
That's it? You're giving in that easily?

994
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,660
You have to admit, that mandoline is quite persuasive.

995
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,280
Gary, you got that list what else is in that trunk?

996
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,260
We can plunder anything from the list, right?

997
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,490
I suppose...

998
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,720
Spiked codpiece...

999
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,150
Depads of the loom...

1000
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:26,800
Unnatural axe...

1001
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:31,540
Lase--

1002
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,120
And now begins the killing!

1003
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:44,580
Nodwick, wait here until we return!

1004
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,060
I've heard of that before.

1005
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:55,620
Mort Kemnon.

1006
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,530
More uninvited guests!

1007
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,290
Your reign of terror ends here!

1008
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:05,320
By the light of Therin you shall fall.

1009
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,970
What good is the light of your godess?

1010
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,680
She cannot help you...here.

1011
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,050
No! We're....

1012
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,270
...doomed.

1013
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,380
Yes!

1014
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,010
Cobweb. Go!

1015
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,750
Face us, necromancer!

1016
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,320
Face my bodyguards!

1017
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:36,350
Mortals.

1018
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,140
Bodyguards?

1019
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,110
I don't remember any...

1020
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:40,840
Oh...

1021
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,610
You can't use a lightsabre!

1022
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,330
It's not even the right system!

1023
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,840
I see no lightsabre. That would be a copyright infringement.

1024
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:57,910
I see a psionic spiritblade.

1025
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:01,920
You do not have my permission to use that in my campaign.

1026
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,170
Fine!

1027
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:06,670
Then you do not have my permission to use my old character.

1028
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,150
You never asked me to make them an NPC...

1029
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:09,160
...and I'm pretty sure you didn't ask Ropie or Dopie either.
You never asked me to make them an NPC...

1030
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,990
...and I'm pretty sure you didn't ask Ropie or Dopie either.

1031
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:17,100
You can use the stuff in the trunk but that's it!

1032
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,050
Turn!

1033
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:27,170
Watch out for Bernnard! He'll backstab you.

1034
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,550
Daphne takes 39 damage.

1035
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,770
Oh god, I've only got 6 hitpoints.

1036
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,730
Splendid.

1037
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,880
Therin, save me!

1038
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:20,980
Let go of my mini.

1039
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,420
Oh, Grim Reaper! Get off the table.

1040
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:26,390
I beliebe I had an arm.

1041
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:29,080
Thank you.

1042
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,600
I think that's everything.

1043
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,250
I think you're missing a section of wall there.

1044
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,550
Really?

1045
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,580
No, no I think that's everything.

1046
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,240
Oh, my mistake.

1047
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,850
Stupid cat.

1048
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,950
Where's he gone?

1049
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,910
There's a hidden door here!

1050
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,740
Welcome to the temple of the true god.

1051
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,500
I promise you this will be our final confrontation.

1052
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:38,010
Sure you can do better.

1053
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,490
As you wish.

1054
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,630
What the fu...

1055
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:44,940
It's from the trunk.

1056
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:54,360
The book!

1057
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,700
Destroy the book.

1058
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,550
Flinn is alone with the book.

1059
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,860
I stab it.....wait....I backstab it!!

1060
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,400
You can't backstab it....you can't sneak attack an inanimate object!

1061
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,580
Why not? It's prone.

1062
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,370
It doesn't have a destroyable anatomy.

1063
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,270
It's got a spine, doesn't it?

1064
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,050
Bards suck...

1065
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:47,410
That was unprecedented, Leo.

1066
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:52,900
On the upside though you did give me a chance to finish casting my spell.

1067
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,180
Which one?

1068
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,010
Please.

1069
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,560
He's not dead yet.

1070
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,360
You....you think you have defeated me?

1071
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,580
Pretty much! You did just explode.

1072
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,560
Twice, actually.

1073
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:32,800
You have only made him more powerful.

1074
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:55,800
Can we please go to sleep now? I'm almost dead.

1075
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,640
You can sleep when we're done here.

1076
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,100
Seriously, I've got 1 hitpoint here.

1077
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,360
Do you remember what Mort Kemnon said right before we killed him?

1078
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,240
¿Bhgaaargrg?

1079
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:10,940
No... "You have only made him more powerful." Who did he mean?

1080
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:17,230
Death! Obviously his god...the source of his power.

1081
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,630
Why would Death become more powerful after we've killed his greatest servant?

1082
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,930
I don't think we have met the final enemy.

1083
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,940
Super! Can we go to bed now?

1084
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,120
In a minute, bard-boy. There's something we're missing.

1085
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,140
There's some connection we haven't made.

1086
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:38,700
You're creating phantoms were there are none. Our adventure has ended.

1087
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:41,170
How do you mean?

1088
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,780
We killed Mort Kemnon. We have the mask.

1089
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:48,120
It's experience points and waffle time.

1090
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:52,350
Our reputation is endured; we have beaten this challenge.

1091
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:58,000
If we have beaten this challenge.....why are we still playing?

1092
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,740
You raised our dinner from the dead.

1093
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:29,990
Apparently..

1094
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,010
It's awful.

1095
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:35,430
I'm morally obliged to destroy this monstrosity.

1096
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,990
.. What would the hierophant say?
I'm morally obliged to destroy this monstrosity.

1097
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:39,580
.. What would the hierophant say?

1098
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,160
He would congratulate you on your victory.

1099
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:50,360
Your grace?? We were not expecting you.

1100
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:50,430
We forgive you. The mask of death? You have obtained it?
Your grace?? We were not expecting you.

1101
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:54,860
We forgive you. The mask of death? You have obtained it?

1102
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,160
Yes, your grace.

1103
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,200
Then the land shall finally know peace.

1104
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:03,430
Quickly now. Hand it over so we may rush it to the cathedral.

1105
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,250
What you ask is impossible, your grace.

1106
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:08,280
We have sworn to return it to the king.

1107
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:12,330
Aye, and he shall have it. Rest assured, we come with his blessing.

1108
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:13,440
Now hand over the mask!

1109
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,250
Your grace, I cannot...

1110
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:18,580
This is not the time for personal glorys, Sir Osric.

1111
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,560
You will hand over the mask!

1112
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,760
Your grace has our answer.

1113
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,810
This is treason! You have been corrupted by the mask!

1114
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,310
I'm gonna die!

1115
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,120
Yeah, you will.

1116
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,200
See ya.

1117
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:37,290
How you shame Therin by alligning with darkness.

1118
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,270
He who stumbles around in darkness with a stick is blind...

1119
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:47,940
..but he who...sticks out in darkness...is...

1120
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,760
...fluorescent!

1121
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:54,090
Loose 50 experience!

1122
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,740
If you would worship death then do so at his side.

1123
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,430
The light of Therin is withdrawn from you.

1124
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,620
Turn!

1125
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,060
I've lost my powers.

1126
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,430
It's still good.

1127
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,650
 It is aparent, in the aftermath of the battle, that the hierophant..

1128
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,150
...is your enemy.

1129
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:03,550
Should have known that dude was evil.

1130
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,130
Should have killed him when we had the chance.

1131
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,800
See! That's why I kill so many NPCs. You never know!

1132
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,540
At least we can ressurect Flinn.

1133
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,280
Actually no. The staff is out of charges.

1134
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,950
We must retrieve the mask.

1135
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:23,340
The longer we wait, the more time the hierophant has to consolidate power.

1136
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,500
It will take us days to cross the mountains.

1137
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,360
We have not a moment to loose.

1138
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:31,370
You journey swiftly back into the king's lands.

1139
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,800
As you go you notice signs of decay that were not there when your adventure began.

1140
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:42,430
You arrive to find the cathedral guarded by paladins.

1141
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:46,000
They're gonna be looking for us.

1142
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:46,050
We'll need a distraction.
They're gonna be looking for us.

1143
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,140
We'll need a distraction.

1144
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:52,760
What?

1145
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,950
Hold peasant! What business brings you to Therin's temple?

1146
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,450
Please father! My husband is dead.

1147
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:17,110
Raise him with Therin's healing hand.

1148
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,960
Your...husband?

1149
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:21,440
Yeah, I'm so a woman.

1150
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,450
Be that as it may,...

1151
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:27,630
Death is a natural thing. We can't ressurect every man that falls.

1152
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:31,170
Not even if I make a donation to the church?

1153
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,440
Therin's blessing be upon you.

1154
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,760
Escort this lady to the infirmary.

1155
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:10,420
I...eh... Sorry, Bill.

1156
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:32,190
That music....I've heard it before.

1157
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:36,130
It's the hymnth of Therin. It calls forth the love of our goddess.

1158
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,160
Alive? Good! It's time.

1159
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,330
Keep that water handy.

1160
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,090
Ok.

1161
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:53,800
Hierophant! We beg an audience.

1162
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:56,080
Ah! Uninvited guests.

1163
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:57,610
Give us the mask.

1164
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,250
And why would we do this?

1165
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,860
It must be destroyed.

1166
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:04,880
My dear boy. Why would I wish the mask destroyed?

1167
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:08,710
It is evil. It must be destroyed for the glory of your goddess.

1168
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:13,410
Ah! It is for the glory of our goddess that we shall wear the mask.

1169
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:15,930
How can you not understand?

1170
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:21,020
Before the threat Mort Kemnon, the people turned their backs on Therin.

1171
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:24,100
They became complacent, unholy.

1172
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,580
By depriving them of their goddess I've rekindled their faith.

1173
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:33,990
Their fear of death trives them into the saving light of Therin!

1174
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,760
When the king finds out what you have done...

1175
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,570
The king? The king would not understand.

1176
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:47,760
Now I rule as king, as hierophant and as avatar of our goddess!

1177
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:56,430
I brought peace to this unworthy lands.

1178
01:23:56,430 --> 01:24:00,470
I ressurected the glory of the light!

1179
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:04,470
And only I am deserving of the power of Therin!

1180
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:09,760
Now...kneel before your new god!!

1181
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:34,540
You have betrayed your vows and your goddess.

1182
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:38,990
She will not stand for this blasphemy. And neither will I.

1183
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:40,780
Then join her in the world beyond.

1184
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,990
Now how did that go...??

1185
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,210
Ah, yes...

1186
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:02,390
# Brings me to Therin, goddess of the light...

1187
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:05,040
- # Her grace...  - Goddess?

1188
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:08,670
Daphne, the heart! Therin is trapped in the heart.

1189
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,630
I am your avatar!

1190
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:22,350
The light of Therin be upon you.

1191
01:25:56,570 --> 01:26:00,400
Rise, Daphne.

1192
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,920
You have freed me from my prison...

1193
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,630
...and have my thanks.

1194
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:08,200
Of all your fellows it was you..

1195
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,870
...who never strayed from the path of godness and law.

1196
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:19,160
And so, as reward, I shall grant you any one wish that you desire.

1197
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,320
No way!

1198
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:25,290
Limited or unlimited?

1199
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:28,630
She's a goddess, dude! It's unlimited!

1200
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:30,100
You could wish for anything.

1201
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,350
Go for levels! You could be like 20th level everything.

1202
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:39,030
No, no, no, gear! Gear! You could wish for everything that is in those books.

1203
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,970
No, no, no! Don't think small!

1204
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:47,400
Wish yourself immortal. Have her to make you a goddess as well.

1205
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:01,130
I wish that you bring Sir Osric back to life.

1206
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:05,200
As you wish...

1207
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,840
That was awesome!

1208
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:11,690
That's beautiful.

1209
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,370
That is so freaking stupid!

1210
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:21,440
I have seen stupid decisions before but that is the single most lame retarded one ever!

1211
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:26,380
You wasted an unlimited wish! On an NPC!

1212
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:32,100
How about wishing for more wishes, or advancing our levels,..

1213
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:32,500
..or giving us magical items.
How about wishing for more wishes, or advancing our levels,..

1214
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,520
..or giving us magical items.

1215
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:38,750
How about wishing yourself immortal first and then ressurecting him yourself?

1216
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,980
Good god! Could have had anything!

1217
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:43,080
It's what my character would have done.

1218
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:46,610
You could have been a god! I know mormones that would have killed for that!

1219
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,150
What was the paladin to us?

1220
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:50,730
He's not even a real character!

1221
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:52,160
We can always get more NPCs.
He's not even a real character!

1222
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,770
We can always get more NPCs.

1223
01:27:54,830 --> 01:28:01,810
You waste the greatest treasure in the game on nothing but a story decision.

1224
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:03,880
Should have never gotten you in.

1225
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,890
You ruined my game! That is it!
Should have never gotten you in.

1226
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:10,030
You ruined my game! That is it!

1227
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:14,350
Damn it, we're gamers! Haven't you learned anything?

1228
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:38,370
So....what happens next?

1229
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,380
Rise, Flinn!

1230
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:22,310
You have my thanks! You shall be my herald and spread music and peace to all my people.

1231
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:33,500
Leo, you gained a level of the Cantor prestige class.

1232
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,280
Rise, Lester.

1233
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,450
You have my thanks.

1234
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:48,620
I would have you enter my service but I cannot have an evil person...

1235
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:53,240
I'm not evil! I'm chaotic neutral. Right?

1236
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:54,590
No.

1237
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,590
- You are evil and a whore.     - Totally.

1238
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:09,390
Gary, you can't remeber any of your spells.

1239
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,360
What did you do to me?

1240
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:15,720
I've burned away your wickedness and made you whole again.

1241
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,690
Game terms, please.

1242
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:21,820
I replaced your levels of sorcerer with equal levels of cleric.

1243
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:26,230
So I have to be.....good?

1244
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:27,350
Yes.

1245
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,470
Thanks??

1246
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:35,470
Where's the monk?

1247
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:40,960
He is gone. He disagreed with the wisdom of my decision.

1248
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:50,920
Rise, Sir Osric. I deputize thy Lord High-Marshall of my paladins.

1249
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:04,820
Go forth, heroes and spread my light..

1250
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:08,070
...to the dark places of the world.

1251
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,620
So I guess that means that the campaign is over, doesn't it?

1252
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:18,480
This one is, yeah.

1253
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,210
I had a good time.

1254
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,620
Me too. That was different....but cool.

1255
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:34,120
Mostly cool. I like the way you game.

1256
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,790
Totally in agreement here.

1257
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:42,310
Well...eh...thanks. Thanks for coming out, guys.

1258
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,800
See ya.

1259
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,430
Thank you, Lodge.

1260
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,640
- Waffles?   - Recognized!

1261
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,950
- Awesome!   - Very cool!

1262
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,750
And of course, everybody gets promos.

1263
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:52,850
Thank you.

1264
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:57,200
I've got one for Cass, since he was in the campaign.

1265
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:03,650
The story doesn't end here, does it?

1266
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:07,100
Oh, no, no. Check it out! I have a cool new villain lined up.

1267
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,300
I've got it from a friend of mine. He's kind of a ninja swashbuckler.

1268
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,850
The shadow!

1269
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,980
The shadow?

1270
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:13,900
The shadow?

1271
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,270
The shadow?!

1272
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:30,030
Hi guys! What's up, Lodge?

1273
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:38,510
Eh... why don't you guys go on into the room there. I'll be right there.

1274
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,530
You've got something published. I know you worked really hard on it.

1275
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,340
Thanks.

1276
01:33:54,450 --> 01:34:02,650
I had a look at it and ...ah...it's actually pretty well balanced to tell the truth, so...

1277
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:11,700
Oh, I heard that you're starting a new campaign and...ah..

1278
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:16,140
..you know...I was thinking that...eh..

1279
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:21,620
If...you need another player.

1280
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,170
I could stop by from time to time.

1281
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,770
Why the change of heart?

1282
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:38,050
You know...if I win....okay...the story ends..

1283
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:42,150
..and I can't avoid to keep going.

1284
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,210
Would you like to join the group, Cass?

1285
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:54,570
Hey! I'm not doing anything else, yeah!

1286
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:57,350
Why don't you join the group, Cass?

1287
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:14,600
Ehm..... I ah...I'll be in the back. Just...ah...I'll be in the back room.

1288
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:24,380
I....ah...I....ah.....I'am a dick!

1289
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,820
Yes.

1290
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,640
Yeah...

1291
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:55,010
So, where does this new adventure start?

1292
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:59,130
Oh, it starts about where you guys left off.

1293
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:05,640
You have saved the kingdom and restored the peace.

1294
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,030
Or have you??

1295
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:10,780
I present to you Lord Osric of Whitetower.

1296
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:39,300
Sit! Arise! Speak!

1297
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:43,000
The mask of death! It's gone. Stolen by the shadow.

1298
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:48,670
It must be recovered. Who will risk their life on this quest?

1299
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:58,160
You guys just got here. Surely there's another hero in our kingdom..

1300
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,240
..that would prefer to go in their place to certain death?

1301
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,590
Alright...it seems unlikely.

1302
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:14,790
Good luck, then. Off you go!
