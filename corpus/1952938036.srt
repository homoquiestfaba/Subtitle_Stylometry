POPPER SR. ON RADIO:
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

2
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:04,269
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

3
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,939
Tippytoe, come in. Are you there?

4
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,108
This is Tippytoe. Over.

5
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:12,444
Did you receive the souvenir package?
Over.

6
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:16,323
Package received. Over.
Is it snowing there now, Dad?

7
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,825
I wouldn't know, kiddo,
because I'm in Marrakech.

8
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:20,035
Whoa!

9
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,245
This is the big one, buddy.
A dream come true.

10
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,122
We have been compromised. Over.

11
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:26,374
Kiss her for me!

12
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,420
This is Mama Bird. Over and out.

13
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:32,923
You, get to sleep.

14
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,841
Guess where I am now, pal. Romania!

(HISSING)

16
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:41,264
Papua New Guinea.
Makes the old Guinea look like nothing.

17
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:49,147
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

18
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:52,776
I can reach now.

19
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,820
Wow! How long have I been gone?

20
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,780
Two months and 17 days.

21
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,449
Well, don't worry, because Samoa
is what we've been looking for.

22
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,284
This one is going to be my legacy.

23
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,328
Yeahbsolutely.

24
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,220
(CRACKLING)

25
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:22,722
(GARBLED) Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe.
Over.

26
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:28,562
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

27
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:31,398
Tippytoe to Bald Eagle. Over.

28
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,984
Come in. Are you there?

29
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:37,779
Hey, kiddo. I'm right on the verge
of something big here.

30
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,907
But I'm not going to make it home
for your birthday.

31
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,992
I'm really sorry,

32
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:44,870
but opportunities like this
are hard to find, Son.

33
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,204
(STATIC)

34
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:54,254
Opportunities like this
are hard to find, Franklin.

35
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:57,924
I'm about to bag a rare species
on this little expedition.

36
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:01,052
Fifteen F.A. R. That's a million absolute.

37
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,470
And a landmark building.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,764
Don't thank me,
just start building a statue.

39
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,850
-Morning, Pippi.
-Mr. Popper.

40
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,435
Contract.

41
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,603
(SNIFFING)

42
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,479
I love the smell of toner in the morning.

43
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:12,689
That's the pertinent printout.

44
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,525
And the person we are purchasing
the property from is present.

45
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,152
Let's do it.

46
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,613
Mr. Popper for Mr. Gremmins.

47
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:21,448
And you are?

48
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,909
Pippi Peponopolis.
I'm Mr. Popper's personal assistant.

49
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:26,620
I process his paperwork
and I procure his periodicals.

50
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,079
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

51
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,206
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

52
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,498
You can go in.

53
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,502
Mr. Popper, sorry to waste your time,

54
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:37,756
but I've changed my mind.
I'm not going to sell.

55
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,216
POPPER: I understand.

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,593
Second thoughts
are as valid as first thoughts.

57
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,844
They just come later.

58
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:46,556
It's just that this building is my last holding
and if I sell, then. . .

59
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,226
Then you're free, and that's a scary thing.

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,687
Hey, I get it.

61
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:53,939
Doing any sailing this year?

62
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:55,565
(SCOFFS)

63
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,858
Who has the time?

64
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:59,861
Yeah. My father sailed
around the world solo.

65
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:01,154
-Yeah.
-Lucky man.

66
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,865
Yeah, pulled a Hemingway.
Just him and the sea.

67
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,993
You know,
that's always been a dream of mine.

68
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:10,205
Oh ! (CHUCKLES) He had some stories.

69
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,457
Like that storm off the Horn of Africa.

70
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,501
-The Horn of Africa?
-Oh, yeah.

71
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:18,964
The sea was calm, the sailing smooth.
When, out of nowhere. . .

72
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,090
(EXCLAIMS)

73
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,593
Twenty-foot swells,
like a hammer punch to the prow.

74
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:27,514
Dad was a heck of a sailor,
but he'd never seen waves like this.

75
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:30,850
(BLOWING) Gale force winds
straight from the Devil's nostrils

76
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:33,270
whipped his ship like a rubber ducky.

77
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,313
The salt spray in his face
felt like a thousand needles.

78
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:38,608
And suddenly, the wind ripped
the mainsail off the mast.

79
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,986
He was doomed.

80
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,487
What did he do?

81
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,155
-What did he do?
-Yes.

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,573
He spun the wheel.

83
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:48,535
Hoisted the jib,
threaded the needle backwards.

84
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,996
And when he came out the other side. . .
Oh, my God !

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,872
Oh, my God !

86
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,835
-What?
-lt can't be. But it is.

87
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,253
What is it?

88
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,379
A blue whale.

89
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:00,922
(IMITATING WHALE CRY)

90
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:07,637
Like a gentle giant,
the most majestic creature on Earth.

91
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:09,639
It's so beautiful.

92
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:10,765
Can you see it?

93
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,143
His skin glistening in the sun.

94
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,229
A rainbow

95
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,649
in the spray of his mighty blowhole.

96
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:22,902
Oh, well. You will get out there,

97
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,654
someday.

98
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:25,989
Mmm.

99
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:32,912
Wait.

100
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,584
-(MEN LAUGHING)
-FRANKLIN: Way to go, Popper.

101
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,336
POPPER: Hey, it's what I do.

102
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,757
Gentlemen, what is the future
of Franklin, Reader & Yates?

103
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,176
A long, slow decline,
getting older and weaker

104
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,510
till it has that funny smell

105
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,138
and starts driving around all day
with the left-turn signal on?

106
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:51,264
Franklin?

107
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:53,016
Or will it be reborn

108
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,270
with vim, vigor and Viagratality?

109
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,064
I say we meet the future head-on.

110
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,317
Sexy!

111
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,694
Come on, guys. It's time to commit.

112
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,906
It's time to go above and Beyoncé,
and put a ring on it.

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,618
Beyoncé is a singer, Franklin.
She's a singer.

114
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,370
Named Beyoncé!

115
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:14,788
Can he hear me?

116
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,581
FRANKLIN: We had a feeling
this was coming, Popper.

117
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,541
We saw the marble slab in your office.

118
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:20,251
Oops.

119
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,922
Popper, there's no one more qualified
than you to take a seat at this table.

120

-FRANKLIN: Don't sit just yet.
-Okay.

121
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:29,469
There is one more prize
we would like you to get for us.

122
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,930
Name it, fellas.

123
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:35,058
Plaza Hotel? Empire State Building?

124
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:37,727
The Pentagon?

125
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:39,437
Tavern on the Green.

126
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,065
Tavern on the Green?

127
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:43,858
What's the matter, Popper?

128
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:48,196
Nothing. It's just kind of a rundown place.

129
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,825
It's the only privately held real estate
in Central Park.

130
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:54,786
We can build anything we want on it.

131
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,332
You mean, like,
wipe it off the face of the Earth?

132
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,583
Start over?

133
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:01,835

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,254
-lt would be like it never existed.
-READER: Exactly

Selma Van Gundy.

She has gotten a thousand offers,
turned them all down.

-Yeah.

143
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:25,066
Last time it took a while.

144
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,986
-Keep it running.
-Sure thing, Mr. Popper.

145
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:30,905
Thomas! Greetings.

146
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,783
Greetings, Rick,
and welcome to our planet.

147
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:37,370
Lately, we've been using the word, "Hi"
or a simple, "Sup?"

148
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:39,914
How are you?

149
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:42,125
I'm better now. Thank you.

150
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,877
No, really, Thomas, how are you?

151
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,128
Really, I'm good.

152
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:50,049
Please look away.

153
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:51,551
Okay, I will.

154
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:57,182
Hey, Popper!
I've been working on my power shot.

155
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:59,851
Let's see what you've got, tough guy.
Come on.

156
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,812
(GROANING)

157
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,731
Ooh ! Oh ! (LAUGHS)

158
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,316
Nice save.

159
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,818
-Hey, Popper.
-Greetings.

160
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:10,737
Did you say hi to Rick?

161
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,947
Yeah. Yeah, he hugged me three times.

162
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,324
I felt like an endangered sequoia.

163
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,117
Come on, we have only gone out
a couple of times.

164
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:17,243
He's a keeper.

165
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:19,078
There is nothing wrong
with a man who recycles.

166
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:22,707
I recycle. I turn decrepit old buildings
into shiny new ones.

167
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,667
Did I mention
he's also incredibly handsome?

168
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:25,877
Really?

169
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,337
Good to see your taste hasn't changed.

170
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:29,797
And thoughtful. And considerate.

171
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,343
-Where is your sister?
-She's having issues.

172
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:34,761
You know, Cooper Keegan?

173
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:36,137
(SOFTLY) Cooper Keegan.

174
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:37,972
(WHISPERING) The love of her life!

to the Snowball Dance, but he never calls.

Madison kissed him in the third period.

00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:50,200
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1055
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:51,994
No, I'm fine.

1056
00:54:52,078 --> 00:54:54,329
Thom, it's me.

1057
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:59,876
My dad used to bring me here
whenever he was home.

1058
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:01,295
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1059
00:55:01,379 --> 00:55:02,921
That was our table.

1060
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:05,382
He used to give me these souvenirs
he'd bring

1061
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:07,926
from his incredible adventures on the road.

1062
00:55:09,345 --> 00:55:12,514
lt was about the only time
I ever got to see him.

1063
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:14,850
Thanks, Dad.

1064
00:55:15,935 --> 00:55:18,645
It's actually a good memory.

1065
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,856
Sometimes they're the worst.

1066
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:25,777
We were married for 15 years,

1067
00:55:25,862 --> 00:55:27,612
and you have never told me that.

1068
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:28,989
Hmm.

1069
00:55:29,741 --> 00:55:32,367
You are a complicated man, Mr. Popper.

I don't know.

00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,625
I think this old place has still got it.

1073
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:44,838
Where are we going?

1074
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:47,382
That's for me to know
and you to find adorable.

1075
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:48,550
Oh, really?

1076
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:49,718
Yes.

1079
00:55:57,101 --> 00:56:00,354
Well, we're out of the medals.
But we had a good time.

1080
00:56:00,438 --> 00:56:01,813
Nice trick.

1081
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:06,485
I can't believe we're doing this.

1082
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:08,904
I brought a girl here once, a long time ago.

1083
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,615
lt was closed,
so we broke in and stole skates.

1084
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:13,200
She sounds amazing.

1085
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:14,618
I thought so.

1086
00:56:14,744 --> 00:56:19,414
Then she got on the ice,
and she was kind of a clutz.

1087
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:21,375
I think she was just trying to impress you.

1088
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:22,793
You remember the boathouse?

1089
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:24,628
Oh, the boathouse.

00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:28,215

They need a full veterinary workup.

You have no idea
what you're doing with these birds.

It's time for me to take these birds
and put them in a proper home.

You aren't giving them what they need.

These aren't children, Mr. Popper.
They're animals.

1130

They need food. They need snow.

one of them needs to be eaten by a whale.

in the zoo or Antarctica.

I will take these penguins.

How does this pertain
to the Van Gundy problem?

1144

Van Gundy? Lots of that. Lots of that.

1145

Mr. Popper,
we're being pressed for progress.

1150
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:08,291
Perhaps I could pamper the penguins
for you.

1151
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:10,252
You need to procure your promotion.

1152
00:59:10,336 --> 00:59:13,880
No, Pippi.
What we need is squid, and plenty of them.

I've been kind of fighting a cold.

1226
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:16,414
Pneumonia.

1227
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,540
(COUGHS)

1228
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:18,708
Move!

1229
01:03:20,127 --> 01:03:21,377
What the. . .

1230
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:25,256
POPPER: If I'd have known you guys were
coming, I'd have cleaned this place up,

1231
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:27,842
fired up the old Zamboni. (CHUCKLES)

1232
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:32,055
The maid comes on Wednesdays.

1233
01:03:35,726 --> 01:03:37,101
He's gone insane.

1234
01:03:37,186 --> 01:03:38,186
FRANKLIN: I've seen this before.

1235
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,063
This is exactly what happened
with Howard Hughes.

1236
01:03:40,689 --> 01:03:41,773
Because you're old.

1237
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:42,857
YATES: Popper.

1238
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:44,359
The Tavern?

1239
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:46,110
Oh ! The Tavern.

1240
01:03:46,195 --> 01:03:48,404
The Tavern is an interesting project.

1241
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:50,907
I have lots of ideas about the Tavern.

1242
01:03:50,991 --> 01:03:53,868
For God's sakes, man !
Pull yourself together.

1243
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:55,954
Your house is full of penguins.

1244
01:03:56,413 --> 01:03:59,374
I know. I know.

1245
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:00,917
I know how it looks.

1246
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:02,460
But it's just one more egg.

1247
01:04:02,586 --> 01:04:05,046
And as soon as it hatches, I'm there.

1248
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,799
Franklin, how long have I worked for you?

1249
01:04:07,883 --> 01:04:09,717
You know how many soccer games
I've skipped?

1250
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,594
And dance recitals?

1251
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,096
What are we doing this for, anyway?

1252
01:04:17,643 --> 01:04:19,936
There are just some things
you can't afford to miss.

1253
01:04:21,522 --> 01:04:25,191
It's too late, we've lost him.
Popper, you're fired.

1254
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:27,652
Okay.

1255
01:04:30,614 --> 01:04:33,700
Best of luck
in your future endeavors, Popper.

1256
01:04:35,619 --> 01:04:36,661
Appreciate it.

1257
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,160
POPPER: (SHIVERING)
Hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch !

1258
01:05:17,661 --> 01:05:20,079
Hatch, hatch, hatch !
Hatch, hatch, hatch !

1259
01:05:20,164 --> 01:05:24,083
Okay, it's going to happen.
I feel it. It's happening.

1260
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:26,252
It's happening right now.
It's happening right now.

1261
01:05:26,337 --> 01:05:27,879
I'm going to give it the touch.

1262
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:30,298
Total belief. Total faith.

1263
01:05:30,382 --> 01:05:31,633
Come on.

1264
01:05:38,015 --> 01:05:39,182
(GROANS)

1265
01:05:39,433 --> 01:05:40,516
Wow.

1266
01:05:57,534 --> 01:05:58,576
Mmm.

1267
01:06:11,966 --> 01:06:14,384
I tried to warn you, Mr. Popper.

1268
01:06:14,593 --> 01:06:17,053
You're just not equipped for this.

1269
01:06:18,597 --> 01:06:22,058
Maybe you should let me
take care of them for a while.

1270
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:51,921
What if the Statue of Liberty

1271
01:06:53,257 --> 01:06:54,298
had a friend?

1272
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:56,009
POPPER: Okay, people!

1273
01:06:56,427 --> 01:06:58,177
No more loafing around.

1274
01:06:58,262 --> 01:06:59,345
What's the matter, folks?

1275
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,222
You've never seen a zombie before?

1276
01:07:01,306 --> 01:07:05,685
That's right, it's the Dawn of the Dead.
I'm eating brains and taking names.

1277
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:07,687
Marshall, get Zoning on the phone,

1278
01:07:07,771 --> 01:07:09,439
I want to know
how soon we can break ground.

1279
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:12,483
Remind them of our donation
to the Mayor's re-election fund.

1280
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:15,278
Boy, I never get tired
of looking at New York from here.

1281
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:16,571
I love what you've done with the place.

1282
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:18,614
Popper, what are you doing here?

1283
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:21,868
I'm on a mission of mercy, Franklin.
I decided to take you back.

1284
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:23,911
You're taking us back? We fired you.

1285
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:26,122
All is forgiven then, don't worry about it.

1286
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:27,707
Let me bring you up to speed.

1287
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:29,876
I've been playing hardball with Van Gundy.

1288
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,045
I told her kids
we were offering $100 million.

1289
01:07:32,337 --> 01:07:36,299
I suggested they make her life difficult
until she accepts,

1290
01:07:36,592 --> 01:07:38,217
so they've all moved back home.

1291
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:40,470
Mrs. Van Gundy has planned
a press conference for tomorrow.

1292
01:07:40,554 --> 01:07:42,055
She wants us all present.

1293
01:07:42,556 --> 01:07:43,639
If you'll excuse us,

1294
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:45,808
we have to unpack.

1295
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:49,103
Popper's back!

1296
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,230
POPPER: Oh, hey, guys!

1297
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:52,565
-Hey, Dad.
-Hi.

1298
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:54,108
Hey, how are you feeling?

1299
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:55,526
Yeah, Dad, are you okay?

1300
01:07:55,611 --> 01:07:57,070
Yeah, I'm fine.

1301
01:07:57,154 --> 01:07:59,322
Before you go in there,

1302
01:07:59,406 --> 01:08:02,825
I think I should tell you,
there has been a couple of changes.

1303
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:13,377
BILLY: Where are they?

1304
01:08:13,462 --> 01:08:16,089
They're okay, they're fine.
They're at the zoo.

1305
01:08:16,173 --> 01:08:18,091
And you know what?
It's really the best place for them.

1306
01:08:18,342 --> 01:08:19,717
They're probably in an icy pool right now.

1307
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:22,678
All the fish they can eat.
Full-time penguin masseuse.

1308
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:25,139
The whole thing's being narrated
by Morgan Freeman.

1309
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:27,225
You sent them away to some cage?

1310
01:08:27,935 --> 01:08:31,979
Billy, they're birds.
They don't feel things the way we do.

1311
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,731
-Thom, I don't think. . .
-Don't bother, Mom.

1312
01:08:33,816 --> 01:08:35,441
Come on, guys.

1313
01:08:35,526 --> 01:08:38,319
We had fun,
but it's time to get back to reality.

1314
01:08:38,403 --> 01:08:40,488
We got soccer.
We got the Snowball Dance.

1315
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:43,491
I'm not going
to the stupid Snowball Dance.

1316
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:46,369
Cooper Keegan asked somebody else.

1317
01:08:47,704 --> 01:08:49,914
Janie,

1318
01:08:49,998 --> 01:08:51,541
sometimes boys are gonna disappoint you.

1319
01:08:53,127 --> 01:08:55,044
I'm not disappointed in him.

1320
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:57,463
BILLY: Janie!

1321
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,927
What was I supposed to do?

1322
01:09:03,053 --> 01:09:04,554
How about feel something?

1323
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,721
Oh !

1324
01:09:06,056 --> 01:09:07,473
Please.

1325
01:09:07,558 --> 01:09:09,225
I feel great.

1326
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:12,645
I saw you with that egg. I saw you !

1327
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:14,105
That wasn't me.

1328
01:09:14,189 --> 01:09:16,566
That was a dream
where people live with penguins.

1329
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,526
And their kids love them.
And all the eggs hatch.

1330
01:09:18,902 --> 01:09:20,236
So wake up!

1331
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,864
Wow.

1332
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:27,910
I think I just did.

1333
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:33,916
And Rick wanted to extend the Ghana trip,
turn it into a vacation.

1334
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:36,502
Are you okay with that, Popper?

1335
01:09:38,797 --> 01:09:40,506
Yeahbsolutely.

Mr. Popper, we're pulling up presently.

1339
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:06,657
(SIGHS) Okay.

1340
01:10:11,413 --> 01:10:12,622

1343
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:44,070
I've never encountered
a creature quite so wise as this.

1344
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:46,989
You see, once it loves you,
it never leaves your side.

1345
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:52,036
I'm sorry, Son, that it took me so long
to Iearn that Iesson.

1346
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,914
But I hope there's still time for you.

1347
01:10:54,998 --> 01:10:57,541
Give your little ones a hug from Grandpa.

1348
01:10:57,626 --> 01:11:01,629
And hold them as close as you can
for as long as you can.

1349
01:11:01,797 --> 01:11:04,757
Bald Eagle, over and out.

1350
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:18,437
All right, everybody in. Let's go.

1351
01:11:18,522 --> 01:11:21,649
We don't want to go
to your stupid press conference.

1352
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:25,528
-We're not going to the press conference.
-Pardon?

1353
01:11:25,737 --> 01:11:28,698
-Driver, take us to the zoo.
-JANIE: What?

1354
01:11:28,782 --> 01:11:30,616
We're getting our penguins back.

1355
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:32,034
-Yes!
-Yes!

1356
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:40,668
Mr. Popper,

1357
01:11:40,752 --> 01:11:42,670
late as usual.

1358
01:11:44,298 --> 01:11:45,423

But, Dad. . .

1362
01:11:50,304 --> 01:11:51,887
Sweetie, you've got to put
your heart out there.

1363
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:55,016
And it might get broken,
but that's how you know you have one.

1364
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,142
Call him.

1365
01:11:56,727 --> 01:11:59,562
Dad, I don't even really like him anymore.

1366
01:12:01,064 --> 01:12:02,356
I just got the name down.

I don't really like her anymore.

01:12:10,991 --> 01:12:12,908

Amanda, hi. Look,

I know this is a total Hail Mary,
but please don't go to Ghana.

Thom, are you kidding me right now?

1379
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:42,313
If you go there with him,
then it becomes a relationship, and. . .

I'm not asking for you
to just jump right back in with me.

I just want one more date.

Just stay
and go on one more date with me.

Please.

1384
01:12:57,037 --> 01:12:59,246
Long pauses are good, right?
lt means she's thinking.

Where are you going to take me
this time, Popper?

you're planning to tear down?

No.

to visit some old friends.

Okay, guys, we're here to get you

1397
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:45,459
out.

1398
01:13:45,836 --> 01:13:47,503
JANIE: They're not here.

1399
01:13:47,587 --> 01:13:48,754
These aren't our guys.

1400
01:13:49,464 --> 01:13:51,048
No, they're not.

1401
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:56,011
-Where are my penguins?
-I'm going to call you back.

1402
01:13:56,888 --> 01:13:59,598
Mr. Popper, they're not your penguins.

1403
01:13:59,683 --> 01:14:02,435
Don't give us the runaround, slick.
Why aren't they out there?

1404
01:14:02,519 --> 01:14:04,979
Because we already have penguins.

1405
01:14:05,063 --> 01:14:06,730
What we don't have is an emu.

1406
01:14:06,857 --> 01:14:08,858
Or a Komodo dragon.

1407
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:10,609
Or a Bengal tiger.

1408
01:14:10,694 --> 01:14:13,195
-What are you talking about?
-Trading, Mr. Popper.

1409
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,490
Zoos do it all the time.
Same as sports teams.

1410
01:14:16,575 --> 01:14:18,951
How do you think the Yankees won
27 championships?

1411
01:14:19,035 --> 01:14:20,244
lt sure wasn't their farm system.

1412
01:14:20,328 --> 01:14:21,537
Where are you sending them?

1413
01:14:21,621 --> 01:14:25,916
Three to Washington, three to Tokyo.
And the two chicks are going to Dubai.

1414
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:28,210
But you can't split them up.
They're a family.

1415
01:14:28,295 --> 01:14:30,880
God's sake! They're just birds.

1416
01:14:31,214 --> 01:14:34,091
Just birds?
And what about the American eagle?

1417
01:14:34,176 --> 01:14:36,260
-ls that just a bird?
-Yes.

1418
01:14:37,179 --> 01:14:38,888
Okay, what about. . .

1419
01:14:39,306 --> 01:14:40,806
Big Bird is a Muppet.

1420
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:42,141
Look, can they just see them?

1421
01:14:42,225 --> 01:14:45,311
My family is torn up about it.
My kids are distraught. Right, Billy?

1422
01:14:46,688 --> 01:14:48,939
Please, sir, can we just say goodbye?

1423
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:50,983
-No.
-POPPER: Children,

1424
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,695
this is what a liar looks like.
Take a mental picture.

1425
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:57,865
Look, Popper, I couldn't even if I wanted to.

1426
01:14:58,074 --> 01:14:59,867
They're already gone.

1427
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:01,160
(HONKING)

1428
01:15:01,244 --> 01:15:02,661
-Loudy!
-Loudy!

1429
01:15:02,746 --> 01:15:04,246
You are a liar.

1430
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:05,748
Popper! Popper!

1431
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:07,333
-There you are!
-Guys!

1432
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:09,251
Get back in there. Ow!

1433
01:15:09,336 --> 01:15:10,961
Bitey! Good job.

1434
01:15:11,713 --> 01:15:14,006
Mr. Popper,
those penguins are going back in the tank.

1435
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,132
No, they're not.

1436
01:15:15,258 --> 01:15:18,135
What do we have here?
Anybody want some fish?

1437
01:15:18,428 --> 01:15:19,929
That's right. Come on in.

1438
01:15:20,013 --> 01:15:22,348
Come on, come on, come on. Hey!

1439
01:15:22,974 --> 01:15:24,308
-Not this time.
-(BANGING ON DOOR)

1440
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:31,941
Do you have some kind of a plan?

1441
01:15:32,025 --> 01:15:34,360
I'm sorry, have we met?

1442
01:15:34,444 --> 01:15:35,444
Come on.

1443
01:15:35,612 --> 01:15:37,446
-(BANGING ON DOOR)
-Let me out!

1444
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,617
-What took you so long?
-MAN: Sorry, sir.

1445
01:15:41,701 --> 01:15:44,245
Sir, what do the suspects look like?

1446
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:46,205
Hmm, uh, let me think.

1447
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:48,707
They're the ones with the eight penguins.

1448
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,334
Now seal all the exits!

1449
01:15:51,294 --> 01:15:52,294
AMANDA: You guys have the babies, right?

1450
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:53,546
JANIE: Yeah, Mom, we got them.

1451
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:56,549
Excuse us!
Avian infectious disease containment!

1452
01:15:56,633 --> 01:15:58,884
-AMANDA: Antarctic bird flu !
-Very bad !

1453
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:01,220
-Diarrhea! Vomiting !
-Vomiting ! Diarrhea!

1454
01:16:01,304 --> 01:16:02,513
You might want to hold your breath.

1455
01:16:02,597 --> 01:16:04,139
Thank you for your co-operation.

1456
01:16:04,641 --> 01:16:05,683
This way.

1457
01:16:08,019 --> 01:16:09,103
-Oh, no!
-Or that way.

1458
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:10,854
BILLY: Come on, guys.
Follow me. Follow me.

1459
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:12,856
Okay, try to act normal.

1460
01:16:38,216 --> 01:16:39,508
-(SQUAWKING)
-Go! Go!

1461
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:42,136
I'll get him on this side. This way!

1462
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:47,349
Get him ! Don't let him in the elevator.
He's heading to the roof.

1463
01:16:48,893 --> 01:16:51,895
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry, ma'am, you can't take this exit.

1464
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,606
No, not this way.

1465
01:17:00,905 --> 01:17:03,282
It's the north side exit,
you can't go this way.

1466
01:17:03,366 --> 01:17:05,451
Thank you. Sorry for the inconvenience.

1467

Hey, miss? Miss!

1469
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,624
All right.

1470
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,793
Nice and neat formation.

1471
01:17:14,878 --> 01:17:17,921
Okay, stay in formation.

1472
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:19,715
Remain calm.

1473
01:17:19,841 --> 01:17:22,134
-What happened?
-I was pricked by a porcupine.

1474
01:17:22,218 --> 01:17:24,136
-Where were you pricked?
-ln my posterior!

1475
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,304
I don't know where that is.

1476
01:17:25,388 --> 01:17:27,389
There's the limo. Just stay in formation.

1477
01:17:27,515 --> 01:17:28,891
JONES: I'm at the rear door, he's not there!

1478
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,310
-Hey!
-Break formation !

1479

-JONES: Popper!
-POPPER: Break formation !

1480

Halt!

1481
01:17:39,986 --> 01:17:42,696
Ha-ha! You lose, slave trader!

1482
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:45,574
I don't think so, Popper.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1483
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:47,326
No, I don't think I'm forgetting something.

1484
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:50,079
Thom, we forgot to do a head count.

1485
01:17:50,163 --> 01:17:51,705
Okay, one thing I forgot.

1486
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:52,998

1487

(YELLS)

1491
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:21,110
She's doing it.

1492
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:26,782

(EXCLAIMING)

1494
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:40,379
Whoa!

1495
01:18:40,463 --> 01:18:42,047
Can you believe that?

1496
01:18:42,382 --> 01:18:44,007
Hey! (LAUGHS)

1497
01:18:44,134 --> 01:18:46,552
Why are you hitting yourself? Huh?
Why are you hitting yourself?

1498
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:48,721
That's not attractive for a zoo official. Huh?

1499
01:18:48,805 --> 01:18:49,930
I'll tell you what.

1500
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:55,394
Now you're trapped like an animal.
It's ironic.

1501
01:18:56,354 --> 01:18:57,855
Hey! Don't. . .

1502
01:18:57,939 --> 01:18:59,022
Come back here!

1503
01:19:00,275 --> 01:19:01,358
Did you see that?

1504
01:19:01,443 --> 01:19:03,736
-Pretty good date so far.
-We're just getting started.

1505
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,362
Driver, Tavern on the Green.

1506
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:08,949
Hold on, boss. Hold on, I got it.

1507
01:19:11,202 --> 01:19:13,120
Hey, hey! Stop!

1508
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:20,586
MRS. VAN GUNDY: There have been
a lot of rumors floating around lately,

1509
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,254
and I'm here to clear them up.

1510
01:19:22,464 --> 01:19:26,049
I have always said
that I would only sell the Tavern

1511
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:29,344
if I found the right person.

1512
01:19:29,429 --> 01:19:32,306
And that's why I'm here to announce...

1513
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:35,559
(SLOWLY) Wait!

1514
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,937
Don't

1515
01:19:39,272 --> 01:19:41,231
do

1516
01:19:41,316 --> 01:19:44,067
it!

1517
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:47,821
Did you like that? The slow motion effect.

1518
01:19:47,906 --> 01:19:49,656
I just wanted to get your attention.

1519
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:52,242
Mrs. Van Gundy, you can't sell this place.

1520
01:19:52,368 --> 01:19:54,787
-I know.
-If you sell it to me, I'll just tear it down.

1521
01:19:54,871 --> 01:19:56,580
And then Freddy and Tito and Klaus,

1522
01:19:56,664 --> 01:19:58,999
and the guy that looks like Chef Boyardee
will be out on the street.

1523
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,794
-I know.
-This place is a part of New York history.

1524
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:05,589
It's a part of my history.
I came here with my father.

1525
01:20:05,673 --> 01:20:09,092
The other day I had the best
second first date a man could ever have.

1526
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:13,138
And I would rather cut my hands off
and stick knives in my eyes than. . .

1527
01:20:13,223 --> 01:20:16,016
Wait, I'd have to do the eyes first
and then the hands,

1528
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,976
and I'd have to have somebody
help me cut the right hand off

1529
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:21,104
-because the left hand would be gone.
-Mr. Popper, stop talking.

1530
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:22,981
-Okay.
-I'm not selling.

1531
01:20:23,066 --> 01:20:24,149
You're not?

1532
01:20:24,234 --> 01:20:25,234
Mmm-mmm.

1533
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:28,111
Glad we got dressed up.

1534
01:20:28,196 --> 01:20:29,947
There he is.

1535
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:33,659
Excuse me, folks.
Nat Jones, New York Zoo.

1536
01:20:33,743 --> 01:20:35,953
This man has been trafficking
in stolen penguins.

1537
01:20:36,037 --> 01:20:39,289
(SCOFFING) What are you even talking
about from left field?

1538
01:20:39,374 --> 01:20:41,542
Penguins?

1539
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:43,168
It's absurd.

1540
01:20:45,421 --> 01:20:47,297
No, no, no! Penguins, please!

1541
01:20:48,842 --> 01:20:51,510
Hi, Pip.
I thought you were going to stay in the car.

1542
01:20:51,594 --> 01:20:52,886
They pecked the power locks.

1543
01:20:54,264 --> 01:20:56,056
He has been keeping
these defenseless creatures

1544
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,850
locked away in his apartment.

1545
01:20:57,934 --> 01:21:00,936
When I tried to save them,
he broke into the zoo and kidnapped them.

1546
01:21:01,271 --> 01:21:03,105
I've seen these penguins before.

1547
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:05,190
Is it true, Mr. Popper?

1548
01:21:05,275 --> 01:21:06,692
Yes, I'm afraid so.

1549
01:21:06,776 --> 01:21:07,943
Why did you do it?

1550
01:21:08,027 --> 01:21:10,779
Knowing you,
it must be for some sort of personal gain.

1551
01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:13,699
Yes, the kind no amount of money can buy.

1552
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:14,992
For Pete's sake.

1553
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:18,537
Mr. Popper and his equally crazy family
believe that these penguins love him.

1554
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:19,705
They are wrong.

1555
01:21:19,789 --> 01:21:23,166
If they have to choose between love
and a nice juicy sardine,

1556
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:25,043
they will choose the fish every time.

1557
01:21:25,128 --> 01:21:26,920
-I don't think so.
-Let's find out.

1558
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:29,381
He's got a fish.

1559
01:21:30,842 --> 01:21:32,217
I got this.

1560
01:21:44,063 --> 01:21:45,606
Come on, guys.

1561
01:21:45,982 --> 01:21:47,357
Come on.

1562
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:51,904
JONES: Come on. Yeah.

1563
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:53,280
That's right.

1564
01:21:53,364 --> 01:21:54,656
Captain, come on.

1565
01:21:54,991 --> 01:21:56,241
Come to Popper.

1571

For what? Winning?
Is that what we do in this country?

1572
01:22:14,594 --> 01:22:15,886
Is that what America is all about?

that that little boy
hadn't gotten lost somewhere.
