1
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:25,451
1.567 makes it
8 degrees.

2
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:28,492
Man: Altair,
Alpha Centauri, Sirius.

3
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:29,643
Leo: Matt Shepherd?

4
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:32,931
It's just a party,
and he asked me.

5
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:34,083
He's really nice.

6
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,493
Yeah, to you, maybe.

7
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:37,292
You guys getting some
good work done over here?

8
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,205
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

9
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:40,488
Yeah, sounds like it.

10
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:41,370
What's the bright one?

11
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:43,524
Uh...

12
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:45,844
Mizar.
It's a double star.

13
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,811
Good.
The one next to it?

14
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:48,804
Uh...

15
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:50,088
Alcor.

16
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:51,846
Good, Biederman,
and the one next to that?

17
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:52,810
Uh...

18
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,210
I don't know.

19
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:57,773
It's Megrez.

20
00:01:57,854 --> 00:01:59,446
I don't think so.

21
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:00,762
Well, you just said
you didn't know.

22
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,843
Well,
it's not Megrez.

23
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,731
It's something else.

24
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,327
Look.

25
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:09,568
It's south
about 10 degrees.

26
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,764
It's probably
a satellite.

27
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:15,572
Let's take
another picture.

28
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,053
We'll send it
to Dr Wolf.

29
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:18,123
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:19,363
It's Megrez.

31
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:20,807
Not Megrez.

32
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:21,770
It is.

33
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,082
It's not.

34
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:29,131
It is.

35
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:32,570

36
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,287

37
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,927

38
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,169
Hmm.

39
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:01,524
Hmm.

40
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:03,570
Hmm.

41
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:07,334
Well, hello there,
little fella.

42
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,245
Do I know you?

43
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:13,692
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

44
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:18,567
And there.

45
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:39,684

46
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:57,809
Come on.

47
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,685
Damn it!

48
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,409
Biederman.

49
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:38,602
Come on, you miserable
piece of crap.

50
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,728
Randy Travis On Radio:
* Still on the bottom *

51
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:54,692
* And he can't
dig out of the hole *

52
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:57,971

53
00:05:58,054 --> 00:06:00,363
Come on, come on.

54
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:06,006
* You're winning now *

55
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:08,449
* Driving his future *

56
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,365
* Right into... *

57
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,853
Recording: You have reached

58
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:13,606
the Department
of Planetary Sciences.

59
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:15,924
* The further he goes... *

60
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:18,130
If you know the extension
of the person you're calling...

61
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,011
* Bottom, but he can't-- *

62
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,129
Ow, Jesus!

63
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,806
press that number now.

64
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:24,168
Damn it!

65
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:43,929
This is relating
to the recall

66
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,323
of American troops
from abroad.

67
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,803
Tragedy struck today
as a charter aircraft

68
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:51,567
carrying an army unit
returning from duty in Japan

69
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:52,769
crashed this morning...

70
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:54,048
Stuart Caley:
White House Press Office

71
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:56,364
says Secretary of
the Treasury Rittenhouse

72
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:59,366
is resigning because
his wife is sick.

73
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:02,207
So who passed
Rittenhouse the hemlock?

74
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:04,728
AFL/CIO wanted him offthe
Council of Economic Advisors

75
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,247
for not supporting
the pension bill,

76
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,290
and the president's going
to need labour next fall.

77
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:09,602
And State's still fuming

78
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:11,412
about the trade office
screw-up at the G-8.

79
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,372
Pentagon is unhappy with his
readiness reduction proposals.

80
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:15,603
Beth: Greenspan
dislikes him.

81
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:18,208
Christ, who didn't
this guy piss off?

82
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:19,966
No wonder
the wife's sick.

83
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:22,409
Jenny Lerner: She's not sick,
she's a drunk.

84
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:25,846
How do you know that?

85
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:28,402
Mike Woodward
over at Treasury.

86
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,610
Mrs Rittenhouse started
drinking a couple of years ago

87
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:36,446
when her husband
had a series of affairs.

88
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:39,048
Stepped it up last summer after
their son died of leukaemia.

89
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:42,331
You want to do something on
the price that wives pay?

90
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:45,724
Mike Woodward?
Wife, 3 kids?

91
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:47,167
He's been after me
for months.

92
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:48,289
So I threw him
a breakfast

93
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:50,171
and hit him up
about Rittenhouse.

94
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,165
Bob Campbell's leaving,
so midnight Saturday

95
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,210
anchor shift
is opening up.

96
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:55,807
Why would I want
to give up the White House

97
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:56,883
for a graveyard weekend--

98
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,692
No, no, no,
not for you, for me.

99
00:07:58,774 --> 00:07:59,763
No.

100
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,764
Beth.

101
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,492
We'll talk
about this later.

102
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:05,532
Very calm. The president will be
back from Camp David tomorrow.

103
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:06,649
Business news, Ira.

104
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:09,407
Just keep working
on Rittenhouse.

105
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:11,644
Maybe Mike's available
for dinner.

106
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:14,931
Do the usual research,
background information.

107
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:18,324
OK, that's it.

108
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,209
Beth, wait.

109
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:24,890
Listen, Beth, what if
it wasn't permanent?

110
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,487
Oh, God,
Jenny, please.

111
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,053
Honey, this
is how it works.

112
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,328
You've done 2 years
of research.

113
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:31,325
Now do 3 as
a segment producer.

114
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:33,052
5 on air doing
domestic features,

115
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:35,967
another 2 in some
cholera-ridden hell hole.

116
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:37,806
And then I'll quit

117
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,646
if they don't give you
a weekend anchor shot.

118
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:41,372
Hello, Caitlin.
There you are.

119
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,287
Are you protecting me
or just holding me back?

120
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:45,329
- Yes.
- OK.

121
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:46,642
Rittenhouse tape and text

122
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,884
on my desk by 4:00 tomorrow,

123
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:51,090
and we'll drop in
the reverses for the 5.

124
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:52,402
OK.

125
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:55,211
At this moment right now--

126
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:56,693
thank you--

127
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:58,685
The pretty little girls
are walking down the aisle.

128
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:00,253
They're spreading flowers.

129
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:01,483
The twins.
What are their names?

130
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,563
Emma and Susanna.

131
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:03,689
They're walking
down the aisles,

132
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:04,923
and they're dropping
rose petals,

133
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,163
and everyone's
smiling at them,

134
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,210
and now she's walking
down the aisle.

135
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,364
Yes, and she stands
beside him.

136
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:12,570
And the priest says,
"Dearly beloved--"

137
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:13,723
Judge.

138
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,930
The judge says,
"Blah, blah, blah.

139
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,493
Sickness and health,
blah, blah, blah.

140
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:22,204
Do you,Jason Lerner, take
Chlorine Whatchamacallit?"

141
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:24,125
Mom, Chloe.

142
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,442
What did I say?

143
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,411
You said "Chlorine."

144
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:28,688
Her name's Chloe.

145
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:29,684
Oh.

146
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:34,048
Well, it's still
a terrible name.

147
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:37,444
Jason says, "Lie, lie, lie,
till death do us part,

148
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,967
blah, blah, blah,"

149
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:40,612
and she says yes,
and he says yes,

150
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:43,606
and it's kissy, kissy, kissy,
and congratulations.

151
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,807
Jenny, you now have
a new stepmother

152
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:53,203
who is 2 years older
than you.

153
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:57,207
The check.

154
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,283
Well, anyway,

155
00:09:58,374 --> 00:09:59,773
as much as I'd like
to stay here

156
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:01,207
and get silly
with you, Mom,

157
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:03,091
I can't.
I gotta go.

158
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:05,085
I know, I know, I know.

159
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,253
I'm sorry about this.

160
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:10,325
We'll get over it.

161
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:12,052
I love you.

162
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,602
I love you, too.

163
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:18,970
Be good.

164
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:26,607
I was with the secretary

165
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,650
since he's been governor
of Connecticut.

166
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:30,326
I came to Washington
with him.

167
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:33,963
I moved here because I was
dedicated to his career.

168
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,931
I trusted the man...

169
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,811
and then he fucked me.

170
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,168
He what?

171
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:40,892
No, I didn't
have sex with him.

172
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,807
I should say / didn't
have sex with him,

173
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,088
but somebody sure did.

174
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,483
It was about to come out,
so he resigned.

175
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:50,532
But because I was hired from
outside the government pool,

176
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:52,730
I don't get conveyed
to the next secretary,

177
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:54,088
so now I'm out a job...

178
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:57,769
Because he couldn't
keep his hands off women.

179
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,766
Do you have proof?

180
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:03,924
He thinks he was
being so clever.

181
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,972
He had a private phone line
installed in his office.

182
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:08,487
Nobody else could answer it.

183
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:10,485
I picked it up once.

184
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:13,372
Said hello,
and it's nobody home.

185
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,206
It rings, he shuts the door.

186
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,888
Why not hang a sign?

187
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,373
Do you have a name?

188
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,206
This is what I get

189
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,773
for talking to the press.

190
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,731
I'm selling my soul
right now.

191
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,374
I can feel it.
I can feel it.

192
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,127
I name a name and get
someone into trouble.

193
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,169
So you do have a name.

194
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,926
Just a first name.

195
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:34,493
Oh, my God.
I'm going to say it.

196
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,246
Ellie.

197
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,928
Ellie. Nothing else?

198
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:42,528
I think the president
knows about it, too.

199
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,765
Overheard the secretary
talking to him about her.

200
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,287
Isn't Washington sick?

201
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:28,565
Hi.

202
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:30,610
How you doing?

203
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:31,604
Can I help you?

204
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:32,729
Well, actually,

205
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,532
we're looking
for your mom.

206
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:35,729
Is she around?

207
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,567
My mom's sick.
She's not here.

208
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:41,771
Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?

209
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,287
Yeah.

210
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:48,494
That's exciting. Looks
like a long trip, huh?

211
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,247
So, listen, do you know
where you're going?

212
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,165
Rittenhouse: She's going
back to the house.

213
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,893
Hey, you want to stop that?

214
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,169
Lily, please.

215
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,164
Lily, that's a pretty name.

216
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:01,690
Lily.

217
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,413
Do as I say.
Go on.

218
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:06,769
If we could just get
a minute of your time.

219
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,048
What do you want from me?

220
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,694
We'd like to talk
about your resignation.

221
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,129
My wife is sick.
She's in the hospital.

222
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:15,774
That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.

223
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:16,923
We could talk
about your wife,

224
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,606
or we could just
talk about Ellie.

225
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:33,006
Turn the camera off.

226
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:36,848
If you want to talk to me,
turn it off.

227
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,407
We know everything.

228
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,688
Nobody knows everything.

229
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:45,323
Well, we know about
the secret phone lines

230
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,644
and the whispered calls
to the president

231
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,645
and about a secretary
of the Treasury

232
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,123
who's kept his entire
department in the dark

233
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:53,613
about what
he's really doing--

234
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,254
about a cover story
about his resignation

235
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,449
that just fell through.

236
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:58,853
You want me to go on?

237
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:02,210
And you're
just gonna break it?

238
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:04,683
Well, that's what we do
for a living.

239
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,572
Well, congratulations.

240
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,565
You now have
the biggest story in history.

241
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,292
Good luck to you.

242
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:12,523
Personally...

243
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,570
I think it's a mistake
to run the story,

244
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,246
but hey, what the hell?

245
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,847
Why not?

246
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,893
What difference
does anything make any more?

247
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:29,372
Look.

248
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,570
I know you'rejust a reporter,

249
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:35,932
but you used to be
a person, right?

250
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:43,123
I wanted to be with my family.

251
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,491
Can you understand that?

252
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,447
OK, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse

253
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,521
resigns because of a mistress
named Ellie.

254
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,122
The biggest story
in history?

255
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:18,326
What an ego.

256
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,604
Now, if it was
the president--

257
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:22,042
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

258
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,802
The president
has a mistress named Ellie,

259
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,686
and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

260
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,327
and takes the fall and resigns,

261
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,481
and the president
buys him a yacht?

262
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,479

263
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,082
Son of a bitch.

264
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,360
Oh, shit.

265
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:43,883
Oh, shit.

266
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:47,405
Right! OK, OK!

267
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,717
Oh, God. Oh, God.

268
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,239
FBI. If you would,
please, ma'am.

269
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:12,444
What do I do
with my car?

270
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,405
We'll take care
of your car.

271
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:14,365
Just step back
to my car.

272
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:15,677
Get her car here.

273
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,844
Let's go.

274
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,682

275
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,362
Would you
come this way please?

276
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,039
Morton Entrekin, Ms Lerner.

277
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,843
I'm expected
back at MSNBC at 6:00.

278
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,443
I think
I should be there.

279
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:03,202
People knew about the Manhattan
Project, you know,

280
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,007
and they kept it a secret.

281
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,968
That was just the creation
of the atom bomb.

282
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,205
Hmm.

283
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:24,717

284
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,164
Ms Lerner, Tom Beck.

285
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:40,524
I understand you've come
into some information.

286
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,362
Ms Lerner was just expressing
her lack of enthusiasm

287
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:44,768
for matters
of national security

288
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:47,238
where journalistic
competitiveness is at stake.

289
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,002
Mr President,
I'm not interested

290
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,398
in using Ellie to
further my career.

291
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,366
What do you know
about E.L.E.?

292
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:59,637
I know you should have
picked a better cover story

293
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:00,605
than a sick wife.

294
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:01,565
See?

295
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,560
What did I tell you?

296
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,880
We'd always thought
the deadline for going public

297
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,721
was the publication
of the budget,

298
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,959
since we've spent
more money than we can hide.

299
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,880
The budget comes out
in 2 weeks.

300
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:18,759
I don't suppose I could convince
you to sit on this for 2 weeks.

301
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,603
No such thing as 2 weeks
in the news business.

302
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:23,917
And I can't appeal
to your sense

303
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,567
of what's in the nation's
best interest?

304
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:28,038
I always thought
the truth

305
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,040
was in the nation's
best interest.

306
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:35,205
Entrekin:
You want to hold her?

307
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,328
What if we go public
in 48 hours?

308
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,127
Now that's doable,
isn't it?

309
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,006
Entrekin: That would be very
difficult, Mr President.

310
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,161
Morton, if she knows,
how long can it be

311
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:49,400
before CNN or the Post
breaks the story?

312
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:51,480
This was never
gonna be a secret

313
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:52,922
as long as you wanted
it to be.

314
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,440
Give us 2 days, Ms Lerner.

315
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,121
You'll get second row,
centre,

316
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,801
at the White House
press conference.

317
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,039
Now, from what I know of your
career, that's a promotion.

318
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,084
I want exclusivity.

319
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:04,841
Now, listen, young lady.

320
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,682
This is a presidential favour.

321
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:09,327
I'm letting you go

322
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,478
because I don't want
another headache.

323
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,888
And I'm trusting you

324
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,644
because I know what this
can do for your career.

325
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,401
It might seem
that we have each other

326
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,127
over the same barrel,
Ms Lerner,

327
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,245
but it just seems that way.

328
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:26,558
I want--

329
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:27,968
Want?

330
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,686
May I...

331
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,522
May I have
the first question?

332
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,726
We'll see you Tuesday,
Ms Lerner.

333
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,486
Come on, come on.

334
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,598
E.L.E., E.L.E.

335
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,358
Paleontology?

336
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:26,723
Paleontology?

337
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,642
What's paleontology
have to do with anything?

338
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,923
Come on.

339
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,202
Beth: Hey.

340
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,358
Hey.

341
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:54,484
Look who's working late.

342
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,207
How's Rittenhouse going?

343
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,722
No sign of the wife yet.

344
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,003
Is she missing?

345
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,158
No. We're still
working on it.

346
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:01,159
We'll get there.

347
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:02,568
I know,
it's a dull story.

348
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,526
Next time we'll get you
something more exciting.

349
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,600
Great.

350
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:08,122
Are you OK?

351
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,358
Yeah.

352
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:10,564
Want to come
to dinner with us?

353
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,482
I can't.
I have plans.

354
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:14,684
OK. We'll see you tomorrow.

355
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,367
Jenny: Thank you.

356
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,445
Ah, here she is.

357
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,042
Jenny.

358
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:35,881
Hello.

359
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,008
Hi, Chloe.

360
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,204
Waiter: Would you like
some champagne, miss?

361
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,757
Martini...big.

362
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,646
I missed you.

363
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:50,801
I mean we missed you
yesterday.

364
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,722
I must say, I'm...

365
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,481
I'm disturbed that
you didn't come

366
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:56,445
to our wedding.

367
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,008
Jason, you
promised.

368
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,602
I know I promised,

369
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,008
but it was
a beautiful event,

370
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,238
and I missed her.

371
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,557
You should have been there.

372
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:05,560
The twins, they were
running around like mad

373
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:07,526
and throwing flowers.

374
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,327
It was wonderful,
especially Emma.

375
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:11,559
You know, the little one.
She loves you.

376
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:12,843
It was beautiful.

377
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:13,964
She missed you, too.

378
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,517
All right.

379
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,440
This is from us
for you.

380
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,884
Are you not
going to open it?

381
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,759
I knew she wouldn't...

382
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:48,080
You can exchange them
if you don't like them.

383
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,000
Jenny,
I know this is hard.

384
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:52,000
I just want you
to be happy.

385
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,124
Happy.

386
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,722
Well,

387
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,528
I would like to propose
a toast to happiness

388
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,565
and to--

389
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,363
Mmm.

390
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:07,882
Mmm.

391
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,007
Are we going to have
an evening or not?

392
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,080
Jenny, I know
that you hate me.

393
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:17,727
I know that you have
terrible things

394
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:19,128
that you want
to say to me.

395
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,484
You have
to get over it.

396
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,127
Life goes on.

397
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,404
Jenny: Life goes on? OK.

398
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,638

399
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:29,602
What's so funny?

400
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,327
Life...

401
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:36,447
We'll see.

402
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,566
What's so funny
about "life goes on"?

403
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:40,968
Life going on?

404
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,802
I don't think it's funny
that life goes on.

405
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,006
Dad, you need to get
back together with Mom.

406
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:51,799
She's all alone in the world,
and she needs you right now.

407
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,607
OK?

408
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:55,645
Jenny.

409
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,526
I just got married.

410
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:58,758
I know, and I'm sorry.

411
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:01,363
Chloe, this has nothing
to do with you.

412
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:02,677
Jason: Well, it has
to do something for me,

413
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:04,919
for Christ's sake.

414
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,124
This is insane.

415
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,564
I have to apologize
for my daughter.

416
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,924
It's not your fault.

417
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,408
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

418
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:14,445
I know you think
I'm a bad person.

419
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:15,484
I'm really not.

420
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:17,560
And I don't hate you.

421
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:20,447
I just--I gotta go.

422
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,207

423
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:50,209
'Cause for her, it doesn't--
Excuse me.

424
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,041
Jenny. Hey.

425
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:54,563
What are you doing here?

426
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:55,877
Uh, yeah.

427
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:57,322
Did Stuart send you here
without telling me?

428
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:58,888
No.

429
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:01,642
If Stuart thinks he can push
me out of the White House--

430
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:03,640
Ms Lerner.
Hi, Beth.

431
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:04,718
Right this way.

432
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,845
I've got you
right down here.

433
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:13,877
Excuse me, please.

434
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:16,844
OK.

435
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:18,885
He'll find you
for the first question.

436
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,288
Then you're on your own.

437
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:23,322
Hey, how are you?

438
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,282
Press Secretary:
Ladies and gentlemen.

439
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:27,882
Ladies and gentlemen,

440
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:30,039
please.

441
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,962
The president will begin
by addressing the nation.

442
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:35,722
Please hold your questions
until he's finished his remarks.

443
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,878
Ladies and gentlemen,

444
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,880
the President
of the United States.

445
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:43,728
Hello, everybody.

446
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,242
- Mr President.
- Hello.

447
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:47,479
Man: 10 seconds,
Mr President.

448
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:50,487
5, 4.

449
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,038
Good evening.

450
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:58,123
A few minutes ago
the United States ambassadors

451
00:25:58,209 --> 00:25:59,244
to every country
in the world

452
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:00,728
told the leaders
of those nations

453
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,208
what I am about
to tell you.

454
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:05,361
It's a bit complicated,
so it will take some time,

455
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,599
so I hope
you will bear with me,

456
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,805
hear what I have to say.

457
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:11,959
A little over a year ago,

458
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:16,281
2 American astronomers,
Marcus Wolfand Leo Biederman,

459
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:18,837
working on a mountain top
in Arizona...

460
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:20,044
Shh.

461
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:21,323
Nobody say
anything.

462
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,922
saw something
in the night sky

463
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,362
that caused them
great concern.

464
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,280
A comet.

465
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,839
But the comet was, well...

466
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:33,842
There was a remote possibility
that the comet was on a path

467
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,887
that could bring it into
direct contact with the Earth.

468
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,800

469
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,163
Now...

470
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:43,321
we get hit all the time
by rocks and meteors,

471
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,526
some of them the size of cars,
some no bigger than your hand.

472
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:49,567
But the comet we discovered
is the size of New York City.

473
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,800
From the north side
of Central Park to the Battery.

474
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:55,801
About 7 miles long.

475
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:57,368
Put another way,

476
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,043
this comet is larger
than Mount Everest.

477
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:04,520
It weighs 500 billion tons.

478
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,998
Now, chances are...

479
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,525
Astrophysicists, geologists
and climatologists.

480
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:11,883
Where the hell
is Science?

481
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:14,688
Check with Tokyo, Tel Aviv.
I want everybody.

482
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,407
The Hale-Bopp stand-ups.

483
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:18,400
Graphics!
I need graphics!

484
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:21,003
President Beck: Comets begin
far out in space.

485
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:22,317
They're what's left over

486
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:24,206
from the creation
of the solar system

487
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:27,247
after the planets were formed
billions of years ago.

488
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,240
These chunks
of space debris

489
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,968
are in an elongated orbit
around our sun,

490
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,004
but every now and then

491
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:34,761
one of them gets bumped

492
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:37,522
like a billiard ball
on a pool table

493
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,486
and is knocked
into a different orbit.

494
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:42,322
If this comet continues
on its path around the sun

495
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:44,320
and keeps
its present course,

496
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:47,560
sometime on August 16,
roughly a year from now,

497
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,844
there's a chance
that we might have impact.

498
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:54,445
So for the past 8 months,
the United States and Russia

499
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,602
have been building the largest
spaceship ever constructed.

500
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:01,283
It's being built in orbit
around the Earth.

501
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:03,724
And we call it the Messiah.

502
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,881
Right now a team of American
astronauts and one Russian

503
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,482
are at Cape Canaveral
in Florida.

504
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:11,959
In 2 months, they will leave
on the shuttle Atlantis

505
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,767
to board the Messiah.

506
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:17,762
This is the crew
that will stop the comet.

507
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:21,239
I'd like the world to meet
some extraordinary people.

508
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:23,559
First is Mission Commander
Oren Monash.

509
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:26,322
Commander, would you introduce
us to your team?

510
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,240
I'd be honoured, sir.

511
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:30,206
Pilot Andrea Baker.

512
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:31,642
Medical Officer

513
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,048
Gus Partenza.

514
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,723
From Russia,
nuclear specialist

515
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:37,925
Colonel Mikhail
Tulchinsky.

516
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,601
Navigator
Mark Simon

517
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:42,647
and Rendezvous Pilot
Spurgeon Tanner.

518
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:45,118
Hello,
Mr President.

519
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:48,884
Captain Tanner,
you flew 6 shuttle missions.

520
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:51,164
You were the last man to walk
on the moon, weren't you?

521
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:52,159
Yes, sir,

522
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:53,443
but Oren here
will be doing

523
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:54,723
most of the flying
on this one.

524
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:55,719
I'll just
be taking us down

525
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,879
to the comet's
surface.

526
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,482
Well, it's good to know
we're going to have

527
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:01,400
your kind of experience
up there, Captain.

528
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,399
Tanner:
thank you, sir.

529
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,478
Godspeed to you all.

530
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,604
We're counting on you.

531
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,805
thank you, sir.

532
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:09,005
Got Beijing, Rome,
Sao Paulo, Cairo, Berlin!

533
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:10,238
Does anyone know how big
the one was

534
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:11,887
that killed
all the dinosaurs?

535
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:14,119
Something majestic, mysterious,
with a fanfare for the intro

536
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:15,528
and a theme
for the longer promos.

537
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:17,281
You want it hitting
the goddam Earth?

538
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:18,643
Well, that's what he's saying.
Bring that up again.

539
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:20,321
It'll scare the shit
out of them.

540
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,286
Beck: We will not tolerate any
disruption ofour way of life.

541
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,406
Our society will
continue as normal.

542
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,686
Work will go on.
You will pay your bills.

543
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,760

544
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:34,444
There will be no hoarding.

545
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:36,724
There will be
no sudden profiteering.

546
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,040
I'm freezing all wages,
all prices.

547
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:43,883
What a bottle of water
cost you yesterday...

548
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:46,437
it will cost you tomorrow.

549
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:47,848
Now we'll take
a few questions.

550
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:49,282
Reporters: Mr President!

551
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:50,597
Ms Lerner.

552
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,042
Ahem.

553
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:55,485
Ahem. Uh,Jenny Lerner,
M--MSNBC.

554
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:56,843
Jenny Lerner?

555
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,282
Son of a bitch.

556
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:01,122
Um, Mr President,

557
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,243
why wasn't this announcement
made sooner?

558
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:06,122
Well, until we knew
we could build the rocket

559
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:08,273
and the comet
could be intercepted,

560
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:10,558
we saw no reason
to alarm the planet.

561
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,201
- Sir!
- Mr President!

562
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:14,843
Do you have another
question, Ms Lerner?

563
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah. Um...

564
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:20,193
Is--Is there a connection
between the comet

565
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:23,195
and the recall of American
troops from abroad?

566
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:24,955
Beck: Our fighting men
and women are coming home

567
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:26,522
because we felt it prudent,

568
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:28,116
in light of domestic
security concerns,

569
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,602
to have them available.

570
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:31,196
Although I certainly hope
we don't need to use them.

571
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:32,159
Next question.

572
00:30:32,243 --> 00:30:33,119
Reporters: Mr President!

573
00:30:33,203 --> 00:30:35,398
Actually, Mr President,

574
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:38,520
if--just one final
question, sir. Um...

575
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:43,040
MSNBC has learned that
Secretary Rittenhouse

576
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:44,556
did not leave
for the reasons

577
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,713
announced by
your administration.

578
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,680
In fact,
isn't it true, sir,

579
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,516
that not everyone
in your administration

580
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:54,993
is convinced that the
Messiah will save us?

581
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:05,796
Secretary Rittenhouse served
his country with full devotion.

582
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:09,478
He resigned
for personal reasons.

583
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:13,112
Now, I can promise you this,
Ms Lerner, all of you,

584
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:15,558
everyone in this room and
everyone listening to my voice,

585
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:19,033
that at some point
over the next 10 months,

586
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:23,913
all of us will entertain
our worst fears and concerns.

587
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:26,915
But I can also
promise you this.

588
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:28,755
Life will go on.

589
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:32,194
We will prevail.

590
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:33,272
Mr President!
Please!

591
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:35,081
Beck: Sally.

592
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:36,915
Sir, what is
the comet's name?

593
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:38,721
The 2 scientists
who found the comet

594
00:31:38,803 --> 00:31:40,282
were killed in a car crash

595
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:42,877
while racing from their
observatory to alert the world.

596
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:44,601
So we named it for them.

597
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:45,911
Wolf-Biederman.

598
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:48,392
Leo Biederman,
they said it again.

599
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:49,438
Shh!

600
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:50,751
Leo, is he talking
about you?

601
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:51,992
He is, isn't he?

602
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,641

603
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:54,758
Can you get that,
please?

604
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:55,832

605
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:57,356
Janie, get the door.

606
00:31:57,443 --> 00:32:00,515
Beck: Well, we have the
technology to build the ship.

607
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,878
They have the technology
to make it go.

608
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,272
There's someone at
the door for you, Leo.

609
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:08,161

610
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:09,961
Newscaster: You've been
watching live coverage

611
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:11,237
of President Tom Beck...

612
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:13,791
I can't believe this.
This is so weird.

613
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,441
Dr Wolf
from Astronomy Club?

614
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:16,558
Yeah, I guess so.

615
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,917
I think
it's really neat.

616
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,197
Nobody on our block

617
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:20,841
discovered the world
was gonna end before.

618
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:22,402
Dan: He's still
very much alive.

619
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,802
He's still alive, everyone.

620
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:25,760
He's right here,
and he's still alive.

621
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,435
OK?

622
00:32:27,523 --> 00:32:28,638
Child:
Hey, Leo, cool!

623
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:29,872
Leo: As far as we know,

624
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:31,794
what happened was
that Doctor Wolf

625
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,396
saw the comet
in my photograph,

626
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,997
so he shared
the discovery with me,

627
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,755
and then he was killed
in that crash

628
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:40,198
and everything got
mixed up in Washington,

629
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:42,274
so the president
thought I was dead, too.

630
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:43,682
- Leo!
- Leo!

631
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:44,912
Jasmine.

632
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:48,473
How does it feel
having your name on it?

633
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:50,872
I don't want anyone to think

634
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:53,272
that I'm trying to take
something away from Dr Wolf,

635
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:56,799
because I'm not,
but it's kind of cool.

636
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:58,077
- Leo!
- Leo!

638
00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:04,156
You know, you're gonna
have sex a lot more now

639
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,392
than anyone else
in our class.

640
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,041

641
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:08,681
Don't listen. Don't.

642
00:33:13,363 --> 00:33:15,035
Really?

643
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:18,593
thank you for your sexual
insight, Mr Thurman.

644
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:19,832
You can sit down now.

645
00:33:19,923 --> 00:33:22,232
Famous people always
get sex, Mr Perry.

646
00:33:22,323 --> 00:33:24,791
That's the main reason
it's good to be famous.

647
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:26,396

648
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,317
Fruit--a reactor,
bottle--a rocket, OK?

649
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:36,722
A nuclear reactor
in space?

650
00:33:36,803 --> 00:33:37,713
Yes.

651
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:38,952
Isn't that dangerous?

652
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:40,112
No, no, no. This is
all Russian design.

653
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:41,431
Russian science.

654
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:43,957
Uh, the same people
who designed Chernobyl.

655
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:45,032
Chernobyl?

656
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,636
Chernobyl almost worked.

[Song Playing ln Background]
* Fly me to the moon *

658
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:50,473
So what happens
after you plant the bomb?

659
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:51,837
Well, we have 7 hours.

660
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:53,117
We're gonna put the
bombs inside the comet.

661
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,238
I'm gonna follow
these two.

662
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,836
I don't trust
that combination.

663
00:33:55,923 --> 00:33:58,437
After 7 hours,
the 14-hour rotational cycle

664
00:33:58,523 --> 00:33:59,842
of the comet spins.

665
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:00,958
We're gonna get married.

666
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:03,079
God knows I want
to marry you,

667
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:04,642
but the day I get back,

668
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,076
the last thing I'm gonna do
is step inside of a church.

669
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,437
I don't do churches well.

670

00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,751
4 and 6 when I went
to the moon?

683
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:32,196
Yeah.

684
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:35,036
Now, you saw me go into space
7 times, didn't ya?

685
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:37,239
I came back every time,
didn't I?

686
00:34:37,323 --> 00:34:40,315
Yeah.

687
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:42,598
Your mother and I used to play
a game when she was still alive.

688

Now, the game was,

689
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:47,241
if there was a chance
I might not be coming back,

690
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:49,393
she wouldn't say it,
and I wouldn't say it.

691
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:50,598

00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,475
Can I take your

00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:06,518
OK.

702
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,002
thank you.

703
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,951
So, what do you
think of the crew?

704
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:14,362
Heroes all.

705
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:16,559
That's the finest group
I ever had the privilege

706
00:35:16,643 --> 00:35:17,553
of working with.

707
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:18,792
Yeah, yeah.

708
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,555
Off the record, huh?

709
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:23,396
Well, they've been trained
in ways I'll never understand.

710
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:24,757
They're smarter
and in better shape

711
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:26,356
than we ever were
in the old days.

712
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:27,876
They're sober, serious.

713
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:30,193
I guess I'd be a little happier
about this whole thing

714
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:33,958
if I thought that any of them
were as scared as I am.

715
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:35,795
Well, they're not
scared of dyin'.

716
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,351
They're just scared
of looking bad on TV.

717
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:42,114
Now, look, I wish
I'd been to the moon.

718
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:44,194
I got respect for everybody
who's gone to the moon,

719
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:45,716
but this mission
ain't going to the moon.

720
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:47,031
That's right.
Frank Gifford,

721
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,398
he was a great football
player in his time,

722
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,553
but if he played now,
he'd get his ass busted.

723
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:52,837
Simon: That's right.

724
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:54,754

725
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,121
All I'm saying is,
the moon did not have

726
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,240
a rotational cycle
of 14 hours.

727
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:08,314
I mean, we only have
7 hours ofdark

728
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:09,802
when the sun's not up
to land on this thing.

729
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:10,998
It was light
when he landed.

730
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,072
This is gonna be dark.

731
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:13,073
We're not gonna
be able to see.

732
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:14,596
You can't see now, Gus.

733
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:16,002
Tulchinsky: Don't worry,
don't worry, don't worry.

734
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:16,959

735
00:36:17,043 --> 00:36:18,317
We what?

736
00:36:18,403 --> 00:36:19,313
We can do it.

737
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:20,961

738
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,920
No, no, no. Sit down.

739
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:28,602
I woke up this morning,
and I realized...

740
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:30,401
none of you
want me here.

741
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:33,441
You don't even really know
who I am, which is OK.

742
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,002
I walked on the moon,

743
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,801
but I didn't belong to you.
I belonged to your daddies.

744
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:39,272
Now, if I ask you
to ask your daddies

745
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,478
what I meant to them,

746
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:42,076
to explain to you
what I'm doing here,

747
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:44,154
that's only gonna
make things worse.

748
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,041
So...what do we do?

749
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:57,079
You haven't trained
for this mission.

750
00:36:57,163 --> 00:36:59,438
We respect you.

751
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:01,002
I appreciate that.

752
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:04,155
But you're here...you're here
because the powers that be

753
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:06,962
think we need a familiar
face on this trip.

754
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:08,442
You're here
for public relations.

755
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:10,479
No, no. I'm here because
the powers that be

756
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,633
know that I'm the only
person on this mission

757
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:14,236
who's ever landed
on the moon.

758
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:16,359
And I have 500 landings
on aircraft carriers.

759
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,558
We've trained on--

760
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:18,871
On flight
simulators.

761
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:20,157
Right?

762
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:23,360
I mean, this is
not a video game, son.

763
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:25,479
It really isn't.

764
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:26,439

765
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:28,241
It really isn't. No.

766
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,233
NASA Announcer: We are go
for auto-sequence start.

767
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:38,076
Atlantis' 4 on-board computers
now have primary control

768
00:37:38,163 --> 00:37:40,279
of all the vehicle's
critical functions.

769
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:41,716
Hefter:
OK, all flight controllers,

770
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,237
we're at T-minus 30 seconds
and counting.

771
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:45,472
Let's take a close look.

772
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,916
APUs look good,

773
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,959
LOX and LH2
are pressurized.

774
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:50,476
Announcer: 1 0, 9...

775
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:51,552
Assistant Flight Director:
We're go for auto-sequence.

776
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:52,792
Hefter: Roger,Jerry.

777
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:54,236
Good luck
and Godspeed, Atlantis.

778
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:55,517
Monash: Thanks, Mitch.

779
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:58,401
Announcer: 3, 2, 1.

780
00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:14,713
Anchorman: Propelled by 500,000
pounds of liquid fuel,

781
00:38:14,803 --> 00:38:17,522
the shuttle crew heads toward
their initial destination.

782
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:19,195
When the crew
enters the Messiah,

783
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:21,751
they will find a payload
of 8 nuclear devices

784
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:24,357
that will eventually be
used to blow up the comet.

785
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:25,842
The Messiah itself
will be powered

786
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:28,232
by an experimental
nuclear propulsion system

787
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:29,517
that was originally created

788
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:30,956
for a very
different purpose.

789
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:35,155
That programme
was called Orion.

790
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:37,882
Now, with the help
of Russian engineers,

791
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:41,194
a technology designed to propel
weapons of mass destruction

792
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:42,796
will power the ship
that will intercept

793
00:38:42,883 --> 00:38:45,602
the greatest threat
our planet has ever faced.

794
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:56,595
Tulchinsky:
Orion burn...

795
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:58,674
in 10, 9,

796
00:38:58,763 --> 00:39:00,958
8, 7,

797
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,681
6, 5,

798
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:04,116
4, 3,

799
00:39:04,203 --> 00:39:06,842
2, 1 , 0.

800
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:19,514
OK, Beth,
White House reactions.

801
00:39:19,603 --> 00:39:21,400
Marianne,
the whole world watching.

802
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:22,552
We have enough
satellite space?

803
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:23,632
78 uplinks.

804
00:39:23,723 --> 00:39:24,997
Tim, Mission Control
in Houston.

805
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,357
Ira, the science guys
lined up?

806
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:27,956
If they got a Ph.D.,
we own them.

807
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:30,113
All right, this is the most
important story of our lives.

808
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:32,592
Let's not muck it up.

809
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:34,036
Stuart,
what about me?

810
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,442
- You're on the anchor desk.
- Whoa!

811
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:37,081
And you could have
been there a lot sooner.

812
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:38,152
What are you
talking about?

813
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,471
You know what
I'm talking about.

814
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:41,155
Don't ever hold back
a story from me again.

815
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:54,877
Hefter: Messiah, Houston.

816
00:39:54,963 --> 00:39:56,760
Transfer trajectory is go.

817
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:58,242
We'll cancel MCC-1 .

818
00:39:58,323 --> 00:40:01,121
You're go
to configure for coast.

819
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:03,922
Roger, Houston, we're
looking good here.

820
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:09,113
Jesus, that's big.

821
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:10,716
Holy shit.

822
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:12,282

823
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:15,521
Partenza: Wow.

824
00:40:15,603 --> 00:40:17,434
Sweet mother of God.

825
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:29,602
Assistant Flight Director:
All circuit breakers are open.

826
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:31,162
Master arm is off.

827
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:32,471
Monash: Roger.

828
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,042
And the detonator
system is safe.

829
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:53,276
Hefter: Messiah, Houston.

830
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:56,002
Stand by for an uplink
of the final mole coordinates.

831
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,152
Confirm when complete.

832
00:40:57,243 --> 00:40:58,471
Monash: Wilco, Houston.

833
00:40:58,563 --> 00:41:00,679
Hey, how's it comin'?

834
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:03,152
Baker: Loading
first nuke now.

835
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,714
Baker: 1,000 feet
to stand-off.

836
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:35,876
R-dot 3, 5-X, 2-Y.

837
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,515
500 feet,

838
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:43,322
R-dot point 3...3-X,

839
00:41:43,403 --> 00:41:45,598
1 point 5-Y.

840
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:47,719
Go for auto trajectory.

841
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:50,838
We're there.

842
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:52,481
Monash:
Residuals are nulled.

843
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:54,155
Baker:
Disengage Orion.

844
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,074
Orion disengaged.

845
00:41:56,163 --> 00:41:58,074
You're on bi-prop.

846
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:10,281
Announcer: This is
a special presentation

847
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,513
of MSNBC News

848
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,241
with Jenny Lerner.

849
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:20,956
Good evening.

850
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:22,715
Sometime in the next hour,

851
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:25,681
the Messiah mission will
enter its most critical phase:

852
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:27,560
the interception
of Wolf-Biederman

853
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:29,395
and the setting of
the nuclear devices

854
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:31,951
that will deflect it off
its collision course with Earth.

855
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:35,513
But first,
Captain Spurgeon Tanner

856
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:37,275
will have to guide
the spacecraft

857
00:42:37,363 --> 00:42:39,638
through the blizzard
of rocks, sand, and ice

858
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,715
that make up
the comet's tail, or coma.

859
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:45,761
The crew will have to complete
its work before the sun rises.

860
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:47,834
Sublimator
looks good, Mick.

861
00:42:47,923 --> 00:42:49,914
Tanner, Over lntercom:
Disengaging auto now.

862
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:51,959
I'm eyeballs out
from here on in.

863
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:54,398
How come that doesn't
make me feel any better?

864
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:55,882
Tanner: I heard that.

865
00:42:55,963 --> 00:42:57,362
Lights on.

866
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:58,876
Cameras on.

867
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:01,523
Tanner: On the Mississippi River
in Mark Twain's time,

868
00:43:01,603 --> 00:43:03,036
there were riverboat pilots

869
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,954
who only knew a few miles
of the river.

870
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:06,635
I mean, conditions
changed so much,

871
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:08,315
you couldn't
know the whole trip.

872
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:10,553
Floods, sandbars,
fallen logs--

873
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:12,679
It was all a riverboat pilot
could do

874
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:16,642
was to know his little
piece of the puzzle.

875
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:19,442
So for the next few hours,
this is my ship.

876
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:22,714
We start our approach.

877
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:35,596
Jenny:
...are images from cameras

878
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:38,277
mounted inside the cargo bay
of the Messiah.

879
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:41,594
Now, these images are delayed
by approximately 20 seconds,

880
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:43,719
due to the distance
they must travel.

881
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:46,397
OK, you can see that the image
is breaking up a bit.

882
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:48,951
Uh, Houston is prepared
for this.

883
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,432
They've informed us that
due to the uncertain make-up

884
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:53,081
of the comet's coma,

885
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:56,314
they're unsure whether or not
transmission will be possible.

886
00:43:56,403 --> 00:43:59,998
OK, now, now, it ap-appears
we're losing reception here.

887
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:03,353
OK, we've--we've
lost picture now.

888
00:44:03,443 --> 00:44:05,513
But we will stay on the air.

889
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:08,481
We'll stay with you
through all of this.

890
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:13,751
Baker, Over lntercom:
Prop 96%.

891
00:44:13,843 --> 00:44:15,196
Dap is in descent.

892
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:16,796
Tanner, Over lntercom:
Roger, descent.

893
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:22,837

894
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:24,276
Oh, my God.

895
00:44:24,363 --> 00:44:27,241
Baker: Look at these.
They're the size of houses.

896
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:28,312
Yeah, I know.

897
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:30,041
I see.

898
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:44,552
Jesus Christ.

899
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:45,917
Baker: Prop, 88%.

900
00:44:46,003 --> 00:44:46,992

901
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,472
Baker: Cabin press, 5.7.

902
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:51,042
Negative guidance errors.

903
00:44:52,363 --> 00:44:53,478
Whoa!

904
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:16,445
Tanner: Use your
primary thrusters.

905
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:18,253
Baker: Primary thrusters.

906
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:29,764
What's the descent rate?

907
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:32,415
3 feet per second. 2.

908
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:33,689
Fire tether pitons.

909
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:34,890
Pitons fired.

910
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:48,970
She's levelling out.

911
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:56,571

912
00:46:15,415 --> 00:46:17,451
Baker:
Depressurizing bay.

913
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:19,605
Tanner: Opening
payload doors.

914
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:22,050
Don't let that little bit
of gravity down there

915
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:23,887
go to your heads.

916
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:25,488
OK.

917
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:27,924
Start the clock.

918
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,650
Jenny: I fall is going
according to schedule,

919
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:22,010
the astronauts should
now be placing the moles

920
00:47:22,095 --> 00:47:23,528
on the comet surface.

921
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:26,607
The moles are, well,
they're what they sound like.

922
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,287
They are drilling machines

923
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:31,412
that burrow
to a depth of 100 metres,

924
00:47:31,495 --> 00:47:33,565
where they wait
to be detonated.

925
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:38,331
Each one carries
a 5,000 kiloton warhead.

926
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:54,368
How's our time?

927
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,764
It's getting tight.
1:36:30.

928
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:58,004
It's taking too long.

929
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,967
Yup.

930
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,491
What happens if
they do not get off

931
00:48:08,575 --> 00:48:10,486
the comet's surface
in time?

932
00:48:10,575 --> 00:48:12,566
The sun striking the comet
will cause the temperature

933
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:15,772
to rise 350 degrees
in just a few minutes

934
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:18,323
and activate
the high-speed gasjets.

935
00:48:18,415 --> 00:48:19,689
Well, if that happens,

936
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:23,051
it will be like trying
to work in a minefield.

937
00:48:23,135 --> 00:48:24,773
Tanner: Mark, what's
your mole 4 readout?

938
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:27,323
Simon: Mole 4
running true at 75 feet.

939
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:30,213

940
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,769
Son of a bitch.

941
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:33,731
Simon: What?

942
00:48:33,815 --> 00:48:34,884
It's stuck.

943
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:35,964
Try backing it up.

944
00:48:36,055 --> 00:48:37,090
Baker: What's your depth?

945
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,449
75 feet.

946
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:39,809
Is that enough?

947
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:41,248
No. That'll just break
pieces off the surface.

948
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,529
That's not
deep enough.

949
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:45,607
Yeah, Fish, I know
that's not deep enough.

950
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:46,844
I'm going in.

951
00:48:46,935 --> 00:48:48,209
Simon: Oren, no.

952
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:50,092
Monash: No, I'm gonna see
if I can free it up.

953
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,808
Stand by,
tether attached.

954
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:54,169
All right, I gotcha.

955
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:56,291
Baker: Oren,
suit pressure, 3.5.

956
00:49:07,815 --> 00:49:09,328
Simon:
Come on, come on.

957
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:14,252
How's my time?

958
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:15,848
Tanner: 23:57.

959
00:49:15,935 --> 00:49:17,732
Another 6 minutes, they won't
have time to get back to us.

960
00:49:19,695 --> 00:49:21,333
Blow the tethers.
Let's go get 'em.

961
00:49:21,415 --> 00:49:23,007
If we go after them,

962
00:49:23,095 --> 00:49:24,574
we may not have enough fuel
to get off the surface.

963
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:25,974
Blow the goddam tethers.

964
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:27,852
Mole 3 at depth.

965
00:49:27,935 --> 00:49:29,607
We're heading
your way, Oren.

966
00:49:29,695 --> 00:49:31,970
Tanner: Calculate exactly
how much prop we need

967
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,568
to get off this rock.

968
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:35,247
We'll shut it down
when we hit it.

969
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:36,450
Will do.

970
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,329
It opens up
into a cave down here.

971
00:49:47,415 --> 00:49:49,053
Mole got jammed
against the side.

972
00:49:50,575 --> 00:49:52,611
Partenza: OK, Fish,
team 2 at location 4.

973
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:53,764
Give me your hand.

974
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:56,689
What the hell happened?

975
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:58,128
I don't know.
I don't know.

976
00:49:58,215 --> 00:49:59,364
Everything
was going great,

977
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,764
and we got jammed
up at 75 feet.

978
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,491
OK, hold up.

979
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:15,169
Monash: All right,
try backing it up.

980
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:16,290
Roger that.

981
00:50:31,935 --> 00:50:33,414
- That's it.
- A little more.

982
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:34,689
Shut it down.

983
00:50:34,775 --> 00:50:36,367
No, they always put
extra in these tanks.

984
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:38,411
Fish, shut it down.

985
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:40,764
OK.

986
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:50,244
Come on, you bastard!
Come on! Time!

987
00:50:50,335 --> 00:50:51,893
1:02.

988
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:53,886
Figured we'd better pick
you kids up after school.

989
00:50:53,975 --> 00:50:57,251
Checkyour 6,
1 00 yards.

990
00:50:57,335 --> 00:50:59,803
Partenza: I think we'd
better hurry, boys.

991
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:10,205
All right, it's going!
It's going!

992
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:27,887
Mole's at 125 feet.

993
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:30,250
The sun's rising behind you.
It's coming up fast.

994
00:51:36,335 --> 00:51:37,848
Face shields down!

995
00:51:37,935 --> 00:51:41,086
Oh, Christ!

996
00:51:41,175 --> 00:51:42,654
Get the hell
out of there!

997
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:44,453

998
00:51:53,095 --> 00:51:54,130
Aah!

999
00:51:54,215 --> 00:51:55,967
Tanner: Oren, get
your visor down.

1000
00:51:56,055 --> 00:51:56,931
Get your visor down!

1001
00:51:57,015 --> 00:51:58,812

1002
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:03,446
Oh! My eyes!

1003
00:52:03,535 --> 00:52:05,093
Ohh!

1004
00:52:06,895 --> 00:52:08,772
Simon:
All right, we got him.

1005
00:52:08,855 --> 00:52:10,368
Monash: Oh, God!
My eyes!

1006
00:52:28,735 --> 00:52:31,374

1007
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:51,048
Baker: Oh, God,
we're losing one.

1008
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:53,968
He's got escape velocity.
1,000 feet and climbing.

1009
00:52:55,095 --> 00:52:57,211
Aah!

1010
00:52:57,295 --> 00:53:00,093
Mark, Mikhail, get
the hell out of there!

1011
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:21,244
Tanner: Firing
primary thrusters.

1012
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:22,370
Payload doors
still open.

1013
00:53:22,455 --> 00:53:23,490
Close 'em as we go.

1014
00:53:42,175 --> 00:53:45,406
Tanner, Over Speaker:
Houston, all moles are at depth.

1015
00:53:45,495 --> 00:53:46,814
Nukes hot and ready.

1016
00:53:48,175 --> 00:53:50,530
We lost Partenza
to explosive outgassing.

1017
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:53,487
And Monash is injured.

1018
00:53:58,455 --> 00:53:59,968
We have to go get Gus.

1019
00:54:00,055 --> 00:54:01,170
Tanner: There's
no time for that.

1020
00:54:01,255 --> 00:54:03,211
Repressurize
the cargo bay.

1021
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:04,614
He's going to die out there!

1022
00:54:04,695 --> 00:54:06,048
We can still find him.
He has a beacon.

1023
00:54:06,135 --> 00:54:07,409
I don't have time
to argue with you.

1024
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,326
Just sit down
and be quiet.

1025
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:10,484
Turn on
the fuckin' locator!

1026
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:11,690
We've used most
of our propellant

1027
00:54:11,775 --> 00:54:13,003
to get us out
of the coma.

1028
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:14,369
We can't just leave him.
We have to go back!

1029
00:54:14,455 --> 00:54:15,934
If we go back for Gus,
we all die.

1030
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:18,131
We can't just
leave him in space!

1031
00:54:18,215 --> 00:54:21,093
Sit down, Mick.
Sit down.

1032
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,324
It's OK.

1033
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:36,932
Jenny: The Messiah has safely
lifted off the comet.

1034
00:54:37,015 --> 00:54:40,087
But sadly,
Gus Partenza has been lost.

1035
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:43,645
Gus Partenza, a native of
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,

1036
00:54:43,735 --> 00:54:46,693
and graduate of
Carnegie-Mellon University,

1037
00:54:46,775 --> 00:54:48,288
joined the NASA
Space Programme

1038
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:50,650
shortly after completing
his medical training

1039
00:54:50,735 --> 00:54:53,249
at Duke University.

1040
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:56,372
Dr Partenza was selected
specifically for this mission,

1041
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:59,049
not only for his
medical expertise,

1042
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:00,773
but also for his dedication

1043
00:55:00,855 --> 00:55:03,244
to the advancement
of space technology.

1044
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:07,490
Yeah.

1045
00:55:16,935 --> 00:55:18,926
With the loss
of Dr Gus Partenza

1046
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,687
and with Oren Monash
injured,

1047
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,324
Captain Spurgeon Tanner
is now in charge of the mission.

1048
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,406
The Messiah
has successfully docked

1049
00:55:26,495 --> 00:55:28,087
with the Orion-powered
boosters

1050
00:55:28,175 --> 00:55:29,654
and is now prepared
to detonate

1051
00:55:29,735 --> 00:55:32,454
the bombs planted
on Wolf-Biederman.

1052
00:55:32,535 --> 00:55:34,093
The Messiah's
exterior-mounted camera

1053
00:55:34,175 --> 00:55:35,733
will show us the detonation,

1054
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:38,170
but not before being
temporarily blocked out

1055
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:39,813
by the nuclear blast.

1056
00:55:39,895 --> 00:55:43,251
Once again, let me remind you,
there is a 20-second delay,

1057
00:55:43,335 --> 00:55:45,485
so when the picture
comes back to us,

1058
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,566
the comet should already
have been knocked off

1059
00:55:47,655 --> 00:55:48,883
its present course.

1060
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:00,125
Tanner: Prepare to remove
safeties and fire.

1061
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:04,814
Tulchinsky:
Safeties removed.

1062
00:56:12,855 --> 00:56:13,765
Weapons armed.

1063
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:24,214

1064
00:56:24,295 --> 00:56:26,809
3, 2, 1 ...

1065
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:28,089
Now.

1066
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,684
Jenny:
So now we're just waiting

1067
00:56:34,775 --> 00:56:36,652
for the picture
to come back.

1068
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:49,286
Decompression in area 6.

1069
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,730

1070
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:00,766
Simon: Mick!

1071
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:02,334
I'll get the halon!

1072
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:04,694
