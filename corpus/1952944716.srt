KING OF THE AVENUE (2010)

2
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,749 
[gentle howling
of the wind]

3
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,100 
[soft beat music]

4
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:37,044

sings indistinct]

00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,827 
(male voice)
All I gotta say
is one name.

7
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:30,800 
Chi-chi Rodriguez.
Puerto Rican. Bam.

8
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:34,170 
Mother fucker. Puerto
Rican, professional golfer.

9
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:36,471 
And all respect due,
I don't think you'd never

10
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:39,308 
ever have a professional
black golfer.

11
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:40,675 
I don't know
about that.

12
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,944 
Oh, come on,
now, Scooter Pie.

13
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:45,748 
Next thing you know
he's gonna be talkin' about
a black president too.

14
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,948 
You better do
whatever the fuck you gotta do

15
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,219 
to make sure you count
boss man's money right too.

16
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:51,986 
Y'all need
to apologize.

17
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:52,886 
Fuck him.

18
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:54,121 
Man, kiss
my ass.

19
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:57,694 
Done deal, right?

20
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:59,527 
With all that
shit talking
you did,

21
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,262 
y'all just woke
boss man's
baby boy,

22
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:02,830 
Where your
daddy at, boy?

23
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,732 
He's taking
a shower.

24
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:07,536 
Let me ask
you something.

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,343 
Do those pajamas hide
the pee stain when
you wet the bed?

26
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:14,008 
Go on back into the bed
before your daddy
catch you

27
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:18,014 
while you're
awake, go,
go ahead.

28
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:20,615 
Why you go say
some dumb shit
like that?

29
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:31,026 
[distorted female voice]
Mommy just needs to take
her medicine.

30
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,979 
Hey, Daddy.

31
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:54,183 
What's the
flashlight for, Taz?

32
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:55,951 
I told you I ain't
raisin' no punk.

33
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,620 
I got the same
dream again.

34
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:04,526 
It's just
a dream,
little man.

35
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:09,334 
Your momma
Ioved you,
you know that.

36
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,135 
Get some sleep.

37
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,401 
Daddy?

38
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,073 
Do you kill people?

39
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,045 
What made
you ask that?

40
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,051 
I got into a fight
with Malcolm
at school.

41
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,683 
Did you get
your ass kicked?

42
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:30,518 
No, I beat
him pretty bad.

43
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,521 
[chuckles proudly]

44
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:35,258 
Yeah. So
what's the problem?

45
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:38,561 
He gave me his
Iunch money and
apologized, but

46
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,762 
some kids told me

47
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,698 
that my daddy
was gonna kill
his daddy.

48
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,766 
Two things:

49
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,467 
one, it doesn't
Iook like you're
gonna need

50
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:50,106 
lunch money tomorrow,

51
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,607 
and two

52
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,208 
I'm not ever
gonna lie to you.

53
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:57,948 
Now, I wouldn't kill
somebody's daddy

54
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,983 
for a fight
between two
little kids,

55
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:05,489 
but if somebody
took something
from me,

56
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,723 
or hurt somebody
that I loved,

57
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:12,062 
I mean, if somebody
hurt you real bad

58
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,464 
I wouldn't kill
their daddy.

59
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:19,603 
I'd kill their
whole family.

60
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,636 
I love you, Daddy.

61
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:23,504 
I love you too.

62
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,612 
There now.

63
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,816 
You get some sleep.

64
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,249 
Guess what?

65
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:38,487 
One day, this is
gonna be yours.

66
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:55,972 
Woo! I'm digging
this shit all day, son.

67
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:59,676 
Fucking-h right. This the
mother fucking future
right here, son.

68
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,745 
Hey, Dooney,
turn on the TV.
The Lakers on.

69
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,278 
Right, Boss.

70
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:15,394 
(male voice from TV)
In sports-

71
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:18,027 
Walk away
from the TV, Dooney.

72
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:24,265 
What?

73
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:26,936 
I said walk
away from
the TV.

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,476 
[cocks]

75
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,174 
Come on.

76
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,843 
Just walk away.

77
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:37,078 
[voice from TV]

78
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:40,484 
Uh-huh. Now
walk back toward.

79
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:41,783 
Oh, come on.

80
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:43,885 
Shut up, mother fucker.
Walk back to me.

81
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,054 
[voice from TV]

82
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,455 
You see
that shit?

83
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:48,790 
Hm.

84
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:49,723 
What?

85
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,227 
Shut the
fuck up.

86
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,129 
[whimpers]

87
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,095 
Open your shirt.

88
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:55,963 
Wha-?

89
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,097 
Shut the fuck up.

90
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:58,567 
[gasps]
What the
fuck, man.

91
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:01,137 
Open your shirt.
You better be
quiet about it.

92
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:04,741 
[grunting]

93
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:05,806 
[gasps]

94
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:16,286 
Now, you're
gonna tell them
everything's cool.

95
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:22,361 
Everything -everything
is cool, man.

96
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:25,662 
Tell them you gotta
go to the bathroom.

97
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:30,702 
-I'm going
to the bathroom
for a minute.

98
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:33,604 
Now take your fuckin'
pants down now.

99
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:34,836 
No, what
the fuck, man?

100
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:36,504 
Take your
mother fucking
pants down.

101
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:39,008 
[heavy breathing]

102
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:41,176 
Take your mother fucking
pants off.

103
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,176 
Huh?

104
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:43,278 
[thud]

105
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,679 
What the
fuck, man?

106
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:46,515 
Open your mouth.

107
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,451 
They were giving
me 25 years, man.

108
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,051 
Open your
mother fucking
mouth, huh?

109
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,752 
[loud]
You fuck over
your niggers, right?

110
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,121 
[muffled speech]

111
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:56,459 
Suck that shit
like a good bitch.

112
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:59,329 
Get your bitch ass up,
come on, keep the shit
in your mouth.

113
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:00,661 
Keep it in
the mouth, easy.

114
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:01,729 
Twenty five
years, man.

115
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:02,831 
Come on.

116
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:13,076 
Are you okay,
Uncle Dooney?

117
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,644 
I'm as far away
from okay
[sniff]

118
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,914 
as you can get,
little man.

119
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,448 
How come?

120
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:25,922 
I betrayed my friends.

121
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:29,092 
They were gonna
give me 25 years.
[sniff].

122
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,992 
They were gonna
take me away from
my family

123
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:32,960 
for a long time.

124
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,297 
That's a
Iot of time,
huh, Dad?

125
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:40,406 
Yeah, that's
a long time, son.

126
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:42,939 
I think you did
the right thing,
Uncle Dooney.

127
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:46,944 
Because I wouldn't
want to be away from
my dad that long.

128
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:51,746 
Turn around and
sit straight.

129
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:58,122 
[coughing]

130
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:26,148 
You seen that?

131
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,116 
Yeah.

132
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:32,890 
See, that's what
happens when you
betray your friends.

133
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,623 
You know better
than to talk about
this to anyone,

134
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:35,123 
you got it?

135
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:39,229 
Okay. I love
you, Daddy.

136
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,463 
Yeah, I
Iove you too.

137
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:56,813 
(Taz, off)
My father's life,
a drug dealer,

138
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:59,215 
A killer
and dead at 38,

139
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,484 
He left behind
a son that loved
him very much.

140
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,655 
And I did,
He was my world,

141
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,990 
Despite what he did
and who he was,

142
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:09,491 
I loved him as if
he was a doctor,
a fireman,

143
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:11,494 
a humanitarian,
but he wasn't,

144
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,830 
He was, for
the most part,
one of those people

145
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,566 
that society
could probably
do without,

146
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:19,303 
Nevertheless, he
was my father,

147
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,206 
my first example
of what a man
should be like

148
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,807 
I watched people
treat him like
a god

149
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,776 
so to me he
was a god,

150
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,277 
I feared him
as much as
I loved him,

151
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:29,744 
and I wanted to
be just like him.

152
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,948 
That's probably why I
became a drug dealer,

153
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,925 
I tried to make sure
my father's fate
wasn't mine,

154
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:42,792 
Like most people
in my Jine
of work,

155
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,028 
I thought I was
smarter than
the game,

156
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,895 
I didn't play it
like everyone else,

157
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:49,066 
Although I could afford
to live anywhere,

158
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,802 
I chose to live
somewhere upscale
but not too upscale

159
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,870 
where my finances
would be an issue,

160
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,172 
Nobody wanted to see
someone too flashy

161
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,007 
in a
conservative neighborhood,

162
00:10:58,072 --> 00:11:00,543 
So to the people
who lived around
me and my family,

163
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:02,345 
I was Joe Ordinary,

164
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,647 
I lived what I
considered the
sucker's life,

165
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:06,415 
nine to five
till you die.

166
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,118 
But most importantly,
I had a routine.

167
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,853 
Good morning, Taz.

168
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,822 
Good morning, Greta.

169
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,800 
Kiss my wife, Amanda,

170
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:27,537 
and our son
who I named after
my father, Norman,

171
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:30,708 
Remember we play
the Tigers today.

172
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:31,874 
At six o'clock.

173
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,108 
Have I
ever forgotten?

174
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:34,242 
Taz.. .

175
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,343 
Done, I'm there,

176
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:36,912 
Mwah. Bye, baby.

177
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:37,979 
Bye.

178
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:56,199 
I told everyone,
including Amanda,

179
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:59,469 
I was the East Coast
rep for a West Coast
consulting firm.

180
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:03,207 
That way no one could ask to
come by my job or see where
I worked.

181
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,142 
You know, Greta,
you water that same
spot every morning.

182
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:07,375 
Mm-hmm.

183
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:29,868 
Now this,
this was
my dope house,

184
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:33,304 
I just call it that because
I would never have drugs
of any kind here,

185
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,638 
I'm the boss.
I leave that to
the soldiers.

186
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:44,051 
I just all it that
because it's where
I do all my dirt.

187
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:46,049 
After Mom died,

188
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:49,588 
nobody wanted to let
a known black drug dealer
adopt a white orphan

189
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:51,388 
but hey, cash is king,

190
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:53,757 
And after years
of fighting
with courts,

191
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:54,823 
I was his,

192
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:02,032 
There you are again,
with that photo album.

193
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,767 
When I got older,
I realized that family

194
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,535 
is someone that
you end up with,

195
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,035 
You don't have
a choice in
the matter,

196
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:08,170 
I swear you look
at that thing

197
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,203 
a hundred
times a week,

198
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:15,713 
But what he did to
make me his son
was a choice

199
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,447 
and it made me
love him even more.

200
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:21,683 
Baby.

201
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,455 
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

202
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,520 
[scoffs]

203
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:26,889 
[cell phone vibrates]

204
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:28,558 
Hello?

205
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:31,428 
Alright, I'll see
I'll see you in
a little bit.

206
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:33,396 
Am I not on
the fucking phone?

207
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,822 
[soft rap
music, indistinct]

208
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:10,335 
[birds chirping]

209
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:12,268 
I'm taking
your car.

210
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:15,139 
No you're not.
I'm taking it.

211
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,573 
You take
the truck.

212
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,908 
I don't feel
like driving that
big old thing.

213
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:20,711 
You're the one
that wanted
the SUV

214
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,812 
with 20
TVs in it,
not me.

215
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,314 
That shit is ghetto.

216
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,316 
Oh, I know
you didn't
call me ghetto.

217
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:27,950 
I'm not saying
you're ghetto.

218
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:32,158 
I'm saying driving
around in a SUV with
20 TVs is ghetto.

219
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:34,325 
But, baby,
isn't that
what you say,

220
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,394 
the man makes the car,
not the other way
around? Right?

221
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,761 
You're always
saying that.

222
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,730 
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

223
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:41,997 
Yeah, you're learning.

224
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,566 
The answer
is still no.

225
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,800 
Why?

226
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,373 
As calm as
I was playing,

227
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:52,441 
what was about to
happen would be huge,

228
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:54,143 
[alarm chirps]

229
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,614 
So huge it was
sure to make me
king of the avenue,

230
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:59,417 
I was getting
ready to make a
deal with the Mexicans,

231
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,088 
I start by getting my product
at wholesale, that's
about half,

232
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,787 
only thing was,

233
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,856 
you better promise
to buy a minimum
every month,

234
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:09,661 
Come hell or high water,
you better buy
that minimum,

235
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:10,926 
But I wasn't worried,

236
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,195 
I was moving
so much shit,

237
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,930 
I was already
doubling minimum.

238
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,933 
I had just hooked
up with these bikers,

239
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,102 
See, they were
white supremacists

240
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,006 
and would buy from me
before my black and
Latin peers,

241
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,040 
I used to think
how my father
would feel

242
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:24,807 
about me working
with racists,

243
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:26,443 
[scoff]
But then, I figured

244
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:33,054 
he woulda told me
to take their
money first,

245
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:36,922 
Cal, My most trusted
friend and general
of my operation,

246
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:41,094 
The son of Scooter Pie.

247
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:43,160 
You'll be
king of the avenue
for sure after this.

248
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,531 
King? No. This
is just about
the money.

249
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,130 
Fuck that.

250
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,599 
Your daddy was
fucking king, man,

251
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,334 
it's your
fucking birthright.

252
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,236 
Yeah, look what
happened to him.

253
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,938 
I'm not going out
like that, man.

254
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,308 
I'm just getting
my cake and
I'm out.

255
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:58,607 
Then you could
be king.

256
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,209 
[chuckles]
Fuck it.

257
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:03,115 
I'll be king
after you? Shit.

258
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,016 
White folks don't
wanna see me living
next to them

259
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:06,583 
acting like I'm
a fucking consultant.

260
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:07,716 
No, we don't.

261
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:10,354 
You know
what I'm saying?

262
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:13,992 
I was playing it
cool to Cal,

263
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,893 
Being the king
was my birthright

264
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,593 
and I wanted it
more than anything,

265
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,362 
And I mean anything!

266
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:21,999 
I would do it or
gladly die trying.

267
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:26,071 
Pop! What
the fuck!

268
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:29,742 
You fucking
back-doored
my deal?

269
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,842 
You shouldn't disturb
what we got going
on here.

270
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,442 
We already
made the deal.

271
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:37,682 
My deal? Hector,
I thought we had
an understanding.

272
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,182 
You guys ain't
my family.

273
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,918 
I don't give a
fuck about you.

274
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,886 
What I care is about
me getting my money.

275
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,254 
I don't care
who I make
the deal with,

276
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,588 
Dooney Jr,

277
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:46,989 
son of the man
my father killed

278
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,525 
when turning informant.

279
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,193 
Current king
of the ave,

280
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,164 
What the fuck
were you thinking,
white boy?

281
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,834 
Not supposed to buy
from anybody but me.

282
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,166 
That's the rules.

283
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,070 
You know 'em,
mother fucker.

284
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,237 
The only reason
you ain't stinkin'

285
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,774 
in a fuckin'
dumpster right now

286
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:05,275 
is 'cause Scooter
Pie talked me
out of it.

287
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,578 
The only reason
I listen to him

288
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,080 
is because he's
my general.

289
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,250 
And his son
is your general.

290
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,587 
Otherwise -I woulda
come to your house

291
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:17,621 
and kill
you myself.

292
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,355 
I'll tell
you something,
white boy.

293
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,959 
King of
the ave

294
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:24,963 
was made for
men like me.

295
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:28,166 
And as much as it
kills me to say it,

296
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,033 
for men like
your father.

297
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,535 
Get this
through your head.

298
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,473 
You're never, ever

299
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:37,541 
gonna be king.

300
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:39,075 
(Hector)
I suggest we go
into my restaurant

301
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,113 
and have a
couple margaritas,

302
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:45,552 
King, baby.

303
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:46,615 
[door slams]

304
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:47,784 
Who the fuck
did you tell?

305
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,887 
I didn't
tell nobody.

306
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:50,953 
Fuck!

307
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,527 
What do you
want to do?

308
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,758 
Nothing. Let's
go home.

309
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,828 
But we need
to talk this
shit out.

310
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,997 
We seen Dooney Jr.
kill for much less
than this.

311
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:01,632 
Fuck that shit
he was saying.

312
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,232 
Only reason
he didn't
try something

313
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,169 
is he didn't want
to get Hector in
the crossfire.

314
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,235 
Just go home.

315
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:07,303 
Come on, man.

316
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,370 
Go!

317
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,848 
Mother fucker, Hector!
Fuck!

318
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,441 
Taz, you
missed the game.

319
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,944 
I know,
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,614 
Work just got crazy.
I got to go to the
west coast.

321
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:50,713 
When?

322
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,114 
Now, I
gotta go now.

323
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:55,755 
[scoff]
The kids are all
meeting for pizza.

324
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,723 
Alright.
Okay.

325
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,559 
You know, he didn't
even let them clear
the scoreboard

326
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:07,201 
until his daddy
saw how good
he did.

327
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:10,603 
Fifty five to five. That's a
good old-fashioned
butt-whipping.

328
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,405 
Sorry, little man.

329
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,807 
Daddy'll see you
next time, okay?

330
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,585 
[gym door slams]

331
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,990 
Stop. Here.

332
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,392 
Do me a favor

333
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,660 
and just go out
to dinner with
your friends

334
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:10,726 
or something, alright?

335
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,229 
Are you okay?

336
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,864 
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just need to take
some shit out.

337
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,299 
But what
about you?

338
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:17,235 
Jesus Christ,
you not fucking
listening to me?

339
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,568 
I said go!

340
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,174 
Why be a fucking
ass to me all
the time?

341
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,307 
Sorry.

342
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:26,078 
[sigh]

343
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,648 
[beeps]

344
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,851 
Cal. Yeah,
what's up?

345
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,654 
Yeah, meet me
at the spot tomorrow.

346
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:37,922 
Tell everyone to
stand alert. Alright.

347
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,123 
[beep]

348
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:41,359 
Fuck.

349
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:42,425 
[beeping]

350
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:07,320 
[distorted]
Mommy just needs
to take her medicine.

351
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:26,970 
Fuck!

352
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:35,212 
Damn.

353
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,916 
Tia.

354
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:43,453 
Tia!

355
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:16,355 
[distorted]
Cumegu. Amulachio.

356
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:47,350 
[crackling flames]

357
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:57,996 
Shh.

358
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:04,870 
Out of the frying pan.

359
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,102 
Who are you?

360
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:11,245 
Who do I
appear to be?

361
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,610 
Yeah.

362
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:14,311 
I'm him.

363
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,713 
What do you
want from me?

364
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,314 
A favor.

365
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,319 
And in return
for that favor,

366
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:23,823 
I will deliver
you right where
you want to be.

367
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:26,191 
King of the avenue.

368
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:28,226 
For my soul?

369
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,361 
We're overcrowded
with souls.

370
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:32,532 
We get
thousands a day.

371
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:35,200 
Not to mention
the billions we
already have.

372
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:40,709 
Your one meager soul
makes no difference
either way.

373
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:42,039 
But why?

374
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:46,814 
Why you?
You're one of
my best workers.

375
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:51,384 
You're just providing
a service. They have
to get it from somewhere.

376
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:53,318 
Might as well
be you, right?

377
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:56,990 
I don't want this
anymore. I'm done.

378
00:23:57,053 --> 00:24:02,764 
You know, Taz,
sometimes we do
too much to turn around.

379
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:06,867 
How do you know
when you've crossed
that line?

380
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,167 
How do we know
when it's too
Iate for us?

381
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:13,173 
Call me conservative,
but when I appear in
your living room,

382
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:15,741 
as a rule of thumb
you can probably assume

383
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:17,208 
you've crossed
that line.

384
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:18,442 
Dooney Junior's king.

385
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:19,777 
He's the one
doing your work.

386
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:21,245 
You need him.

387
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:26,054 
The world sees Dooney Jr.
as a common street thug.

388
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:28,085 
Only com for table
in the hood.

389
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:30,589 
He can't go
to the places
I need him to go.

390
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:33,693 
You can.

391
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:37,130 
You're an
all-American
white male.

392
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:40,533 
Blue-eyed to boot.
That's all I need

393
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:44,171 
to put you where
you need to be.

394
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,204 
So here's
the deal plan.

395
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,909 
You become king
and do my bidding

396
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:53,313 
and I will save
your family from
Dooney Junior.

397
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:57,150 
You've got no choice.

398
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:01,154 
Let's face it.
He hates you.

399
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:05,726 
For what
your father
did to his.

400
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:09,363 
And he's been
waiting for
a reason .

401
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:14,769 
Dooney Jr. is plotting
to kill your family
as we speak.

402
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:19,174 
And once he's had his way
with your precious Amanda,

403
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:21,673 
her summer
dress pulled up,

404
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:24,143 
bent over
your kitchen sink,

405
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,710 
back dooring her,

406
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,882 
he's gonna go to
work on your
little boy.

407
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:33,454 
Little Norman
as he makes you watch.

408
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:36,823 
Whatever you decide,
deal with me.

409
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:40,527 
I will meet you
tomorrow at midnight

410
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:44,365 
at your father's
final resting place.

411
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:46,832 
If you're not there,

412
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:49,669 
I'll take that
as a no and
Ieave you alone.

413
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:55,907 
(Tia)
Baby.

414
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,346 
What are you
doing on the floor?

415
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,382 
Something told
me to come home.

416
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:03,614 
Let's get you in bed.

417
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:14,993 
My father broke
by the rules, right?

418
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,229 
Well, what
happened? Huh?

419
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:18,997 
Taz's father
killed him, right?

420
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:21,567 
Two days
before my fuckin'
tenth birthday,

421
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:26,241 
how the fuck you think
I felt on my birthday?

422
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:28,774 
You know, I'm the wrong
motherfucker to ask
for forgiveness.

423
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,044 
You cannot live
by your father's life.

424
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:32,610 
You're not getting
what I'm saying, man.

425
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,312 
It's a done
fuckin' deal.

426
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:35,713 
What are you
talkin' about?

427
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:37,616 
I already sent
one of my boys
to nail him.

428
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,084 
You gotta have
permission from
the commission

429
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:40,551 
before you
kill a boss.

430
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:43,790 
They're gonna find out
where his girlfriend lives,

431
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:46,593 
where his son lives,

432
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:47,892 
they're gonna do 'em too.

433
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,528 
Why the boy's family?

434
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:51,630 
'Cause I'm not gonna
make the same mistake
his father did.

435
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:55,803 
See -Taz's son
will grow up
one day, man,

436
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:59,073 
and the only way
to keep the weed
from growin'

437
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,240 
is to take it
from the roots.

438
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:02,707 
And don't
worry, man.

439
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:04,776 
I told him
to make sure
not to touch Cal.

440
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:06,579 
Let me ask you
something, Scooter.

441
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:09,716 
What side
are you on?

442
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:18,364 
I'm on
your side,
boss man.

443
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:19,423 
[beep]

444
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,795 
I don't
wanna go.

445
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:26,732 
It's too dangerous.

446
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,233 
But I'd rather be
in danger with you

447
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:29,400 
than stay
without you.

448
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:55,661 
Where the fuck
are my keys?

449
00:27:55,727 --> 00:28:00,435 
[doorbell rings]

450
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:01,498 
[muffled shot]

451
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:03,937 
[piercing scream]

452
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,137 
It's all right.

453
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:09,173 
Shit.

454
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:15,646 
You all right?

455
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:16,715 
Fuck.

456
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:17,782 
You okay?

457
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:18,850 
Yeah.

458
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,720 
[indistinct].

459
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:22,420 
I'll get the car
and put it
in the garage.

460
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:23,521 
Are you okay?

461
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:25,190 
Yeah, I'm fine!
Go clean up.

462
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:28,527 
[birds chirping]

463
00:28:28,592 --> 00:28:30,028 
You know, Pops called.

464
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:33,266 
Said Daddy Junior
put out the hit.

465
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,833 
We need to
do something, man.

466
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,669 
I thought
I heard
a scream .

467
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:37,837 
Where do
you live?

468
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:39,672 
I live next door!

469
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:40,940 
Right next door?

470
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:43,209 
[gasps]

471
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:44,876 
You didn't
hear shit.

472
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:48,215 
[swallows hard]
Okay, man. Okay.

473
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:49,814 
I didn't
see anything.

474
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:51,818 
And I didn't
hear anything.

475
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:53,686 
Okay. All right.

476
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,183 
It appears as
if we have
a deal.

477
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:03,557 
So what now?

478
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:04,956 
You become
the king.

479
00:30:05,023 --> 00:30:07,193 
What, so, you
just wave your
hands around

480
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:09,227 
and do some magic
or something
or what?

481
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:11,865 
Do I look like a
Ieprechaun to you?

482
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,933 
Then what?

483
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:17,104 
Open it.

484
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:19,740 
What?
Fuck that!

485
00:30:19,804 --> 00:30:21,273 
Aren't you
the devil?

486
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:23,409 
Can't you just raise
him out of there
or something?

487
00:30:23,474 --> 00:30:29,117 
Contrary to popular belief,
I don't just wave
a magic wand.

488
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,052 
Different events
have to take place

489
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:34,888 
for you to
become this king.

490
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:36,990 
For those
events to happen,

491
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:39,393 
I must bring
forth a demon.

492
00:30:39,457 --> 00:30:42,094 
This demon
needs a host.

493
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,465 
And to show that
this is your will,

494
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:48,068 
kind of like
the signing of the
proverbial contract,

495
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:51,339 
the host must be
only the people
you love the most.

496
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,045 
The only
reason to do this
is to save my family.

497
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,851 
I'm an opportunist,
I really don't care
why you're doing it.

498
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:04,484 
As long as you're
doing my will.

499
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:06,084 
Thanks.

500
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:45,725 
Jesus!

501
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,795 
You've signed your contract.
I'll take it from here.

502
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:16,856 
[cell phone vibrates]

503
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:22,094 
Hello?

504
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:23,396 
(Amanda)
Taz.

505
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:24,496 
Amanda.

506
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:28,002 
Honey, you need
to come home.

507
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,569 
Why? What's wrong?

508
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:32,339 
Baby, I don't know
how to tell you this.

509
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:35,208 
Why? What happened?

510
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:38,948 
The people from
the cemetery called.

511
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:42,183 
Somebody dug up
your father's
grave and

512
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:45,486 
and stole
his remains.

513
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,553 
Did you hear
what I just said?

514
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:50,323 
[flat tone]
Yeah. Oh my God.
That's horrible.

515
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:51,490 
What did they say?

516
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:52,992 
Don't worry about
that right now.

517
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,128 
Can you please
just come home?
I'm really scared.

518
00:32:55,194 --> 00:33:00,504 
Okay. Uh

519
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:01,935 
I gotta call
you back.

520
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:13,412 
Give me
your hand.

521
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:15,615 
Why?

522
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,648 
Now.

523
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:25,859 
[scratching]

524
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:26,925 
[moan]

525
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,973 
[loud thud]

526
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,379 
[squeaky footsteps]

527
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:46,679 
You need anything?

528
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:48,080 
Why?

529
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:51,353 
Scooter Pie
gave me your stuff.

530
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,687 
I never got
rid of it.

531
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,087 
You want
something to eat?

532
00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:59,228 
I don't eat.

533
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:04,300 
So, what do
we do now, Pops?

534
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:06,467 
My name
is De'Sha.

535
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:08,869 
Oh.

536
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,136 
Okay.

537
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:12,406 
[chuckles]

538
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,875 
Let's get
one thing clear.

539
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,244 
I don't give
a fuck about you.

540
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:19,881 
I'm a demon
straight from hell.

541
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:22,449 
Sent to wreak havoc
and do whatever
is necessary

542
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:26,053 
to make you
king of the avenue.

543
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:28,255 
So don't think,
just because I'm
in this body

544
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,992 
that it somehow
ties us emotionally.

545
00:34:31,056 --> 00:34:36,032 
I'm here to
do his will.

546
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:39,234 
And if
I'm commanded

547
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:42,203 
I'll take you out
and leave you on
the field for dead.

548
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:45,072 
That's just
what I do.

549
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:49,513 
And that's
the story of
you and me.

550
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:52,580 
Now go
get dressed.

551
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:06,026 
Whoa, how'd
you know
about that?

552
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:08,930 
I know
everything you know.

553
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:10,429 
Pop the trunk.

554
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:11,965 
[cell vibrating]

555
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,835 
Yeah!

556
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,302 
Council meeting?

557
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:18,405 
I didn't know
anything about
a council meeting.

558
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:22,077 
Huh. That's
'cause it's
about you.

559
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:25,213 
(Dooney)
So now J'm the
motherfucking bad guy?

560
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:27,882 
Dooney, you know you
can't put a hit
on a boss

561
00:35:27,946 --> 00:35:29,783 
without all
us votin' on it.

562
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:31,083 
Those are
the rules.

563
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,853 
That mother fucker
broke the rules first.

564
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:34,053 
I agree
with Dooney.

565
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,922 
You would.

566
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:37,558 
What the fuck's
that supposed
to mean?

567
00:35:37,623 --> 00:35:41,564 
Nigger. It means Dooney
gives you your shit
for a discount.

568
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:43,764 
So you're gonna
agree with anything
he says.

569
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:44,830 
You his bitch.

570
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:46,467 
Stanley, shut
the fuck up.

571
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:48,702 
I'll sell my shit
to whoever the
fuck I want

572
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:50,403 
for whatever the
price I want to.

573
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,738 
Anybody got
a problem with that?

574
00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:54,073 
I don't blame Taz
for doing what
he did.

575
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:57,813 
Shit. You ain't
showing nobody
no love.

576
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:00,548 
A nigger gonna fuck around
and starve to death
dealing with you.

577
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:05,788 
Motherfuckers, I am
the mother fucking
king! Me!

578
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:07,854 
And the rules are:

579
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,190 
nobody can buy
shit from nobody
but me

580
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:11,791 
unless I
say otherwise.

581
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:15,230 
I chose these
mother fucking bandits
from wild wild west.

582
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:16,897 
Dooney, calm dow-!

583
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:19,734 
Calm down!

584
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:23,004 
We don't need
to start a war.

585
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:25,205 
I think what we
need to do

586
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:29,077 
is let Taz
answer some of
these accusations.

587
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:30,744 
Mother fucker, of course
you gonna say that!

588
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:33,046 
You mother fucking
white boys
stick together.

589
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:35,249 
White boy?
I'm Italian.

590
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:37,352 
[scoffs]
Same shit to me.

591
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,886 
A white boy that
eats good.

592
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:40,521 
I didn't come here
to get disrespected.

593
00:36:40,586 --> 00:36:43,224 
Mother fucker, I'm the one
that disrespected in
this bitch!

594
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,593 
Dooney, come on.
Dooney, just chill.

595
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:50,533 
I mean nobody's
disrespecting you, alright?

596
00:36:50,596 --> 00:36:56,341 
Right, Ed?

597
00:36:56,402 --> 00:36:58,139 
Stanley?

598
00:36:58,204 --> 00:37:00,541 
I'm just sayin'
what's on my mind.

599
00:37:00,606 --> 00:37:03,378 
Ain't that why we
had these meetings?

600
00:37:23,396 --> 00:37:26,033 
Let's just fucking
vote, alright?

601
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,636 
Who's not in favor
of the hit on Taz?

602
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,701 
Raise your hand.

603
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:35,443 
And who's
in favor
of the hit?

604
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:41,115 
See? Vote
came to an end.

605
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,653 
That's it.

606
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:46,186 
His ass is mine.

607
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:47,821 
[gunfire]

608
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:09,344 
Prepare for
a baptism.

609
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:10,444 
[gunshot]

610
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,550 
Now who said
your vote
didn't count?

611
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:24,561 
Three things. One,
this never happened.

612
00:38:24,624 --> 00:38:29,968 
Two, Taz is now
the new king of
the avenue.

613
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:33,235 
And three

614
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:36,371 
y'all gonna get
your shit for half
price from now on.

615
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:40,744 
See? That's what
the fuck I'm
talkin' about.

616
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:42,242 
Yeah.

617
00:38:42,308 --> 00:38:46,683 
It's not
like we don't
appreciate

618
00:38:46,745 --> 00:38:50,052 
all this.

619
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:51,218 
But you just
killed five!

620
00:38:51,284 --> 00:38:54,891 
Watch your
tone, mother fucker!

621
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:56,857 
You just killed

622
00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:59,795 
five bosses

623
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:03,866 
and the king.

624
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:10,475 
It's gonna be all-out war
out there on the streets.

625
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:12,774 
I'll handle
that shit.

626
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,412 
Y'all just go about
business as usual.

627
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:18,948 
And you remember, when
the mother fucker's
in the room,

628
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:20,380 
you just talk to
the mother fucker,

629
00:39:20,446 --> 00:39:22,249 
you don't
yell at him.
You got that?

630
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:23,583 
Yes.

631
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:26,021 
Say I'm a
bitch-ass nigger.

632
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:27,353 
I'm a
bitch-ass nigger.

633
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:39,068 
(Taz, off)
At the time, I wasn't aware
of what had just happened,

634
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:41,737 
especially because the
demon showed the
same emotion

635
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,840 
as if he had
just swatted
a fly.

636
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:48,176 
But that was
only the tip
of the iceberg,

637
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:49,811 
It would've been
an all-out war

638
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:51,846 
if the crews of
the dead bosses

639
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:53,313 
woke up the next
morning and found
out what happened

640
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:54,815 
to their Ieaders.

641
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:57,853 
Except for
the crews of
these bosses,

642
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,521 
waking up
was not
an option,

643
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:03,793 
That night, I drove
the demon around

644
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:09,601 
as he massacred 28 of
the most influential
people in the gang,

645
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:12,568 
Sometimes it's not
how many you kill,

646
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:14,937 
it's who you kill.

647
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:17,138 
It was actually
pretty easy
for him.

648
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:18,706 
No one even knew
there was a war,

649
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:21,209 
Everyone just had
their guards
down, so

650
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:23,979 
he just kind
of picked them off
like fish in a barrel.

651
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,923 
[sigh]

652
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:38,292 
[knocks at door]

653
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:47,902 
Ask them
what they want.

654
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,706 
What do
you want?

655
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:53,776 
A lot of people
died last night.

656
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,743 
A lot of people
die every night.

657
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:57,879 
Yeah, but you're
not one of them.

658
00:40:57,944 --> 00:40:59,346 
Fancy police work.

659
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:01,416 
You think
this is
a joke?

660
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:04,788 
I think the joke
is you guys are
here at my door

661
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:06,921 
saying that you're here
'cause I'm not dead.

662
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,925 
A lot of your
constituents were
murdered last night.

663
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,392 
Constituents?

664
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,762 
Yeah. You're a
drug dealer, right?

665
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:15,931 
Drug dealing is illegal
in the state of Florida.

666
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,531 
Where were you
Iast night?

667
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:18,433 
Where were you?

668
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:20,301 
What?

669
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:23,372 
What you're basically saying
is I'm a suspect because
I'm alive.

670
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,139 
That would make you
a suspect too.

671
00:41:25,204 --> 00:41:26,807 
Where were
you last night?

672
00:41:26,873 --> 00:41:29,478 
I know
where he was.

673
00:41:29,543 --> 00:41:31,380 
I came over
Iast night.

674
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:32,947 
Twice. Okay?

675
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:35,550 
I looked at this boy
straight in the eyes

676
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:38,087 
and I told him,
''Turn the music down.''

677
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,555 
He wouldn't turn
the music down. He
wouldn't listen to me.

678
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:43,626 
Hey, wh -where you
guys going?
Hey! Hey!

679
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:50,300 
I told them what
you wanted me
to say.

680
00:41:50,364 --> 00:41:54,137 
Please don't
hurt me. Please.

681
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,738 
Please.

682
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,975 
We have to meet
with the Mexicans.

683
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:03,246 
(Hector)
Twenty eight
bodies in one night,

684
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,649 
You had a busy night.
And it shows.

685
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:09,718 
Man. That gotta
be some kind
of record.

686
00:42:09,783 --> 00:42:11,085 
I'm not impressed.

687
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,987 
I don't know
what you're
talking about.

688
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:15,657 
So I take it you're here
for the same deal I
gave Dooney Jr.

689
00:42:15,722 --> 00:42:19,563 
Yeah. The deal
that was supposed
to be mine.

690
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:21,095 
I don't trust him.

691
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,030 
Hector, what's up
with your boy?

692
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:25,132 
Dooney was gonna
get him tickets
for a game.

693
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:27,067 
Well, tell him
I'll give him
season tickets

694
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:28,870 
if he just
shuts the
fuck up, alright?

695
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:30,772 
Taz -don't

696
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:33,676 
Hector. I'm here
to do business.

697
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,942 
The deal's yours.

698
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:38,948 
Good.
Good.

699
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:40,012 
We'll be
in touch.

700
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:48,857 
Look, you taco
eating mother fuckers

701
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:50,992 
Wouldn't that be
chicken eating mother fucker?

702
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:53,027 
[chuckles]

703
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:58,436 
Well, I guess we all
gonna be some chicken
taco eatin' mother fuckers.

704
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:01,070 
The old
deal is off.

705
00:43:01,134 --> 00:43:05,642 
The new deal
is 10% less.

706
00:43:05,706 --> 00:43:09,012 
Dooney Jr. and all
the crew's gone,

707
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:12,014 
we gonna be moving
40% more weight,

708
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,349 
making a lot
more money.

709
00:43:14,414 --> 00:43:19,323 
So pony up,
mother fuckers.

Hi, guys.
Your order, please.

711
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:23,891 
I guess

712
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,329 
we'll be having
chicken tacos.

713
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:28,363 
Okay.

It's me, boy.

720
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:51,353 
Come on, Pop,
use your key.

721
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,396 
Well I'll
be calling
your ass.

722
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:05,268 
It's about Taz.

723
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:08,304 
Baby. Go take
a shower.

724
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:30,994 
Police have few leads,
but the question in
everyone's mind is

725
00:44:31,058 --> 00:44:36,268 
vigilante justice
or the biggest turf
war in decades?

726
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:37,497 
Where's Taz?

727
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:39,067 
I talked to two
of the other bosses.

728
00:44:39,132 --> 00:44:41,169 
And they say that Taz
is the new king of
the avenue.

729
00:44:41,234 --> 00:44:43,973 
In one night?
Hold up, Pop.

730
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:46,977 
They're saying
Taz did all this?

731
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:49,813 
I, like this they ain't
speakin' all of it.

732
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:51,646 
but he's now
the fucking
top dog.

733
00:44:51,712 --> 00:44:53,515 
Who the
top crew?

734
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,585 
Holy shit! He
fucking did it!
We top crew?

735
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,687 
I gotta get dressed.
I gotta find Taz.

736
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:01,357 
Good. 'Cause
I'm going with
your ass.

737
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:02,857 
Let me go
throw some
clothes on.

00:45:20,808 --> 00:45:22,577 
What's up?
You the man,

741
00:45:22,642 --> 00:45:23,878 
How you
pull that off?

742
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:26,717 
I'll fill
you in later,
all right?

743
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:28,818 
Hey, Scooter.

745
00:45:30,217 --> 00:45:33,691 
So, uh, I
gotta leave for
a little while.

746
00:45:33,755 --> 00:45:35,224 
I need you to run ship
while I'm gone, okay?

747
00:45:35,288 --> 00:45:36,490 
Done deal.

748
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:39,328 
Son, I gotta talk
to Taz for a minute.

749
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:40,460 
About what?

750
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:41,863 
Well, get your
ass in the car.

751
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:45,368 
Hey, Cal,
give us a
minute, alright?

What's up?

755
00:45:52,305 --> 00:45:53,808 
Did you
do this?

756
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,179 
I did what I had
to do to protect
my family?

757
00:45:56,243 --> 00:45:58,246 
I know.

758
00:45:58,311 --> 00:46:01,417 
Now look.
I need a job.

My son, Cal,
he's all I got.

I do whatever
I gotta do

763
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:13,562 
to make sure
that he's safe.

764
00:46:13,628 --> 00:46:15,565 
I didn't want
this life for
him, man.

765
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,368 
But you know,
kids see everything.

766
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:21,671 
Even though we think
they're not paying attention,

767
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:24,173 
they are.

768

Shame on us
for that.

We tried to
make you tough.

770
00:46:27,307 --> 00:46:29,712 
I mean, we used to say
''We ain't raisin'
no punks''

771
00:46:29,777 --> 00:46:34,085 
and with that, we gave
our kids a front
row seat

772
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:36,953 
to our
world of death
and destruction.

773
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:39,389 
And all
I can ask
of you is

774
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:41,022

some bad shit
to be handled

do it, man.

to walk away, man.

I wanted him to do

and that I was
gonna be out of
sight for a month,

He didn't
understand why but

792

much of what I said,

He just did it.

00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:38,382

still upset about
your father.

father's remains.

know about that?

that told you.

Is everything okay?

Everything's fine.
Could we just

815
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:19,290 
not talk
about it right
now, please?

were the best 30
days of my life,

I thought I always
wanted to be,

And now that
I had it,

I'd have gladly
given it all away

823
00:49:07,935 --> 00:49:11,676 
just to relive
those 30 days,

gonna be gone, Dad?

want you to go.

What's the matter?

He was crying
'cause he didn't
want me to leave.

king more powerful.

856
00:51:53,535 --> 00:51:57,375 
You the shit, Taz,
and everyone
knows it.

857
00:51:57,439 --> 00:51:59,610 
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

858
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:03,013 
You ain't said two
words since you
got in the car.

859
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,685 
You wanna get
married, man?
Have some kids?

860
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,419 
Where the fuck
did that come from?

861
00:52:09,485 --> 00:52:11,120 
Man, don't waste
that shit on me.

862
00:52:11,186 --> 00:52:14,025 
I mean, that's cool
for you 'cause you
the boss man.

863
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,293 
But me?
I'm a rider.

864
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:18,963 
You and Pops,
the only family
I want.

865
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:20,530 
That's it.

866
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,399 
After that,
I don't give
a fuck.

867
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:25,803 
Change this
radio station.

868
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:28,004 
Let's put on some
white boy music.

869
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:31,074 
Why you always gotta
go playing that white
boy shit, man?

870
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:33,309 
Hip hop's
where it's
at, dawg.

871
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:34,845 
Hip-hop's dead.

872
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,780 
Stanley wants to
meet us here?

873
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:39,015 
Yeah, he asked
for a meeting
with the king.

874
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,450 
It's like
being the mayor.

875
00:52:40,516 --> 00:52:42,620 
You gotta shake
some hands, kiss
some babies.

876
00:52:42,684 --> 00:52:45,856 
(crowd)
Surprise!

877
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:50,363 
[cheering
and clapping]

878
00:52:50,426 --> 00:52:51,594 
What's this?

879
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,329 
Everyone's here
to show you respect.

880
00:52:53,396 --> 00:52:56,535 
Welcome you
as the new boss man.

881
00:52:56,598 --> 00:52:58,668 
I love
you, mother fucker.

882
00:52:58,733 --> 00:53:00,436 
We made it.

883
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:05,245 
Taz. I've been in
the game a long time.

884
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:07,612 
I'm gonna tell you

885
00:53:07,676 --> 00:53:10,381 
it ain't never
been this good.

886
00:53:10,446 --> 00:53:16,858 
Appreciate it.

887
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:19,088 
Thank you. We
appreciate it too.

888
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:24,097 
Of course.

889
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:29,436 
Congrats.

890
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,501 
Now let's go party
with these ladies.

891

# [indistinct] #

892
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:45,849 
Dude, for real.

893
00:53:45,914 --> 00:53:47,450 
You know
what I mean?

894
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,051 
[ice clinking]

895
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:50,753 
Watch out.

896
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:52,289 
What the fuck
you say to me?

897
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:53,824 
You heard what I said.
Get the fuck out
of my way.

898
00:53:53,888 --> 00:53:54,956 
Fuck you, nigger.

899
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,459 
What you wanna do?
Wanna die?

900
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,060 
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Relax.

901
00:53:58,126 --> 00:53:59,963 
Hey, man.
Who are you?
Who are you with?

902
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,931 
You don't know
who I am, man?

903
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:03,734 
They call me
Homicidal, boss man.

904
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:05,935 
And if he with you,
then I apologize.

905
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:08,206 
Well, he
is. Relax.

906
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:10,975 
Then I apologize, man,
for that reason.

907
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,076 
For that reason only,
believe that.

908
00:54:13,142 --> 00:54:15,613 
Keep smiling.

909
00:54:15,677 --> 00:54:16,712 
Bitch.

910
00:54:16,778 --> 00:54:17,980 
We gonna
talk later.

911
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,282 
We got
your bitch-ass.

912
00:54:19,348 --> 00:54:21,351 
What's wrong with you?
Let that shit go.

913
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:23,521 
Fuck that nigger.

914
00:54:23,586 --> 00:54:27,927 
You see gangsters?
Gangsters?

915
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:30,260 
They go to jail.

916
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:34,567 
Time of the street thug?
That shit's over. Done.

917
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:39,239 
You will never ever
see anyone from
my crew

918
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:42,908 
wearing saggy pants
and the oversized shirt.

919
00:54:42,971 --> 00:54:44,374 
The only thing
missing are
floppy shoes

920
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,648 
and the red noses,
fucking clowns,

921
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:52,517 
See, this is a
business. Alright?

922
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:56,588 
Like the military uses
camouflage to blend into
their surroundings?

923
00:54:56,652 --> 00:55:01,495 
Our camouflage are suits,
conducting ourselves
like gentlemen.

924
00:55:01,557 --> 00:55:04,964 
Keeping the violence to
an absolute minimum, Cal.

925
00:55:05,027 --> 00:55:06,496 
I'm watching
you, homey.

926
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:09,234 
Reach out.

927
00:55:09,298 --> 00:55:11,769 
Apply these principles
to your operation,

928
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:15,340 
I guarantee you the
era of prosperity

929
00:55:15,404 --> 00:55:17,474 
will be here
for years
to come.

930
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,310 
Hear ye,
hear ye, mother fuckers.

931
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,376 
Cheers.

932
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:21,444 
Drink up!

# [indistinct] #

934
00:55:59,348 --> 00:56:01,853 
Baby, pour my man
some more drink.

935
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,052 
Okay, baby.

936
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,822 
Thank you, sweetheart.

937
00:56:08,524 --> 00:56:10,829 
Everything that we've
been dreaming about

938
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:12,528 
I was
telling you
about that shit

939
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:15,732 
Hey, Cal! Hey!

940
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:17,267 
I let this
shit go once.

941
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,203 
What's up, nigger?
What's up, nigger?

942
00:56:19,268 --> 00:56:20,203 
What are you?

943
00:56:20,269 --> 00:56:21,704 
[thud]
[girl screams]

944
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:23,373 
What the
fuck I tell
you, mother fucker?

945
00:56:23,439 --> 00:56:25,877 
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

946
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:28,378 
Somebody come get
this mother fucker
outta my party.

947
00:56:28,444 --> 00:56:30,614 
What the fuck
are you doin'?

948
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,988 
What's wrong with you?

949
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,523 
Stupid ass mother fucker.

950
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:42,227 
# I'm not braggin'
I'm a fuckin' dragon #

951
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:44,294 
# They don't
Wanna fuck
With me #

952
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,734 
# I got my 9 mm
Bitch with me #

953
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:50,501 
# Now they 'bout
To feel a nigga's fury ##

954
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:52,236 
Shit. Mother fuckers.

955
00:57:15,592 --> 00:57:17,562 
[approaching footsteps]

956
00:57:17,627 --> 00:57:20,164 
[demon chuckles]

957
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:22,734 
What did
you do?

958
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,470 
Why the fuck would you
kill this nigger at
my party

959
00:57:25,534 --> 00:57:27,170 
and bring this
heat to me?

960
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,741 
I told you three
mother fuckin' times,
nigger. I didn't do it.

961
00:57:29,806 --> 00:57:32,410 
You know what, Cal?
You need to deal
with this shit.

962
00:57:32,475 --> 00:57:33,945 
Why the fuck
do I need to
deal with it?

963
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:35,779 
'Cause you broke
the bottle over
his head.

964
00:57:35,845 --> 00:57:37,180 
He was
a bitch!

965
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:40,686 
Well, take this
bitch to the swamps.

966
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,423 
Fuck! Go ahead,
handle it, Cal.

967
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:46,123 
We appreciate
your hospitality

968
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:47,591 
we'll get
this cleaned up.

969
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:49,694 
Thanks a lot,
boss man.

970
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:51,361 
I'll do it
to keep the peace.

971
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,632 
But this shit
is fucked up.

972
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:55,232 
I'll do it.

973
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:56,733 
Just help me
get him in the
back seat.

974
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,137 
(Taz, off)
After that
little glitch,

975
00:57:59,201 --> 00:58:01,338 
things went exactly
according to plan,

976
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:03,406 
making money
hand over fist.

977
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:05,510 
We had everything
we wanted: money,

978
00:58:05,575 --> 00:58:07,812 
houses, cars,

979
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:10,515 
and the women, oh,
the women would
do anything

980
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,049 
just to be
in our world.

981
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:14,786 
We were young, rich,
and unstoppable,

982
00:58:19,154 --> 00:58:21,324 
Since Cal was running
the business so well

983
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:23,795 
I started spending less
and less time in
the hood

984
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,697 
and more time
with my family.

985
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:28,601 
Got to the point where
I hardly even seen the
demon anymore,

986
00:58:28,665 --> 00:58:31,302 
Hey, look, my mom
collects these.

987
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:33,037 
Is that
cool, Mommy?

988
00:58:33,102 --> 00:58:34,204 
Yeah, look.

989
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,810 
Look, Daddy.

990
00:58:37,874 --> 00:58:39,711 
Grrr.

991
00:58:39,776 --> 00:58:41,278 
Norman, put
that back.

992
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:43,881 
I'm gonna
get yah. I'm
gonna get Daddy.

993
00:58:43,946 --> 00:58:46,918 
[harshly]
Stop it! Okay?
I ust take that off.

994
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,420 
You might rip
it -or something.

995
00:58:49,486 --> 00:58:52,658 
[sigh]

996
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:53,990 
Sorry.

997
00:58:54,056 --> 00:58:58,432 
[motorcycle revving]

998
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,332 
Can we go see
the motorcycles?

999
00:59:00,397 --> 00:59:02,233 
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm gonna
stay here.

1000
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:04,770 
Taz? Be nice.

1001
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:09,441 
Whoa. Cool!

1002
00:59:09,506 --> 00:59:11,776 
No, you can never
have one of
these, son.

1003
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:14,212 
Holy shit,
it's the king.

1004
00:59:14,277 --> 00:59:15,312 
(Norman)
Is this
your motorcycle?

1005
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:18,550 
That's right,
little fella.

1006
00:59:18,615 --> 00:59:20,819 
A pleasure having
the king's son on
my bike.

1007
00:59:20,884 --> 00:59:23,689 
Dad, what are
you a king of?

1008
00:59:23,753 --> 00:59:27,025 
The streets haven't been
the same since you taken
over, my brother.

1009
00:59:27,089 --> 00:59:28,559 
It's definitely
a pleasure.

1010
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:30,428 
Come on,
Iet's go.

1011
00:59:30,493 --> 00:59:32,062 
Is that
your lady, too?

1012
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:35,300 
You don't know me,
you made a mistake.
Okay?

1013
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:40,470 
Yeah, you
got that.

1014
00:59:40,537 --> 00:59:42,841 
You got that.
You the king.

1015
00:59:42,906 --> 00:59:44,442 
Come on,
Iet's go, son.

1016
00:59:46,443 --> 00:59:47,378 
What was
that about?

1017
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:48,312 
He thought
he knew me.

1018
00:59:48,378 --> 00:59:49,379 
Then why
did he?

1019
00:59:49,446 --> 00:59:50,614 
[brusquely]
That's all !

1020
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:57,623 
[cell phone vibrates]

1021
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:02,763 
What's up, Cal?

1022
01:00:02,826 --> 01:00:04,663 
Shit.

1023
01:00:04,728 --> 01:00:06,965 
(Cal)
We made the streets
flourish like this.

1024
01:00:07,029 --> 01:00:08,999 
We paid you every
fucking month!

And now you
want more money?

1026
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:12,570 
You might as well
put a gun to our head.

1027
01:00:12,636 --> 01:00:14,272 
I'd rather not.

1028
01:00:14,337 --> 01:00:15,772 
Well, if it's
on, it's on.

1029
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:16,941 
[chuckles]

1030
01:00:17,006 --> 01:00:18,007 
Cal

1031
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:20,445 
let me talk
to Hector.

1032
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,912 
[chuckling]

1033
01:00:28,952 --> 01:00:31,123 
Your boy needs to
Iearn some respect.

1034
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:35,028 
Maybe. But like me,
he said we had
a deal.

1035
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:39,365 
Taz, Taz, Taz.

1036
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:41,833 
You take care of
your people well.

1037
01:00:41,898 --> 01:00:45,305 
That makes them
respect you,
Iove you.

1038
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:48,874 
That is something
that is going to keep
you on top for a long time.

1039
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,942 
If I allow it.

1040
01:00:51,008 --> 01:00:53,011 
I made you.

1041
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:56,582 
I can
make Frank,
Eddie or Stanley.

1042
01:00:56,646 --> 01:01:00,020 
You might be
the king of
the avenue,

1043
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:03,189 
but I am king of
the fucking world.

1044
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:05,290 
[chuckles]

1045
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:17,968 
What happened?

1046
01:01:18,035 --> 01:01:19,036 
Done.

1047
01:01:19,102 --> 01:01:20,370 
Are you
good with this?

1048
01:01:20,437 --> 01:01:22,174 
No, but fuck it.
That's the way
it is.

1049
01:01:22,238 --> 01:01:23,908 
25% more, whatever.

1050
01:01:23,974 --> 01:01:26,044 
We're still getting
four times as much as
we were before, right?

1051
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:29,048 
Hey! Trust me. This
is how you keep
the peace.

1052
01:01:29,112 --> 01:01:30,180 
Fuck that!

1053
01:01:30,246 --> 01:01:32,316 
Done, Cal!
It's fuckin' done.

1054
01:01:36,453 --> 01:01:38,423 
Just let me worry
about that, alright?

1055
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:40,325 
Whatever you
say, Taz.

1056
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,172 
Come on, that's
not even a problem.

1057
01:01:53,236 --> 01:01:56,241 
Listen, you've
been keeping all
of our bellies full.

1058
01:01:56,306 --> 01:01:58,176 
It'll be my pleasure.

1059
01:01:58,241 --> 01:02:00,746 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know
the little restaurant.

1060
01:02:00,811 --> 01:02:02,280 
The one on
Common Street?

1061
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:05,684 
Through the kitchen.
Okay. Then I'll see
you there.

1062
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,586 
Perfect. Alright.

1063
01:02:19,162 --> 01:02:21,266 
Come back to bed
for a little while.

1064
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:26,040 
I can't,
I gotta go.

1065
01:02:26,103 --> 01:02:27,840 
I can't seem
to get enough
of you.

1066
01:02:27,905 --> 01:02:29,574 
It's not my fault.

1067
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:31,476 
Stop being
so adorable.

1068
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:33,444 
[snorts]
You know what?

1069
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,315 
You always find a way
to distract me from
my work.

1070
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:39,853 
That's good every
now and then.

1071
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:43,791 
Some might
think otherwise.
[kiss]

1072
01:02:43,854 --> 01:02:46,626 
Let's go have
a quickie.

1073
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:03,308 
Whoa, whoa, Stan,
what the fuck
are you doin'?

1074
01:03:03,373 --> 01:03:08,984 
You ain't gotta put
deli cuts in my face
or poison me.

1075
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:12,118 
Fuck all
that craziness.

1076
01:03:12,182 --> 01:03:16,290 
You put one
right between
my eyes.

1077
01:03:16,352 --> 01:03:18,590 
Calm down, man.
What the fuck's
the matter with you, man?

1078
01:03:18,656 --> 01:03:20,492 
Come to my house
waving a fuckin'
gun around

1079
01:03:20,558 --> 01:03:23,095 
talkin' about
killin', man?
What happened?

1080
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,667 
They sliced his
whole face up, man.

1081
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,569 
[shouts and screams]

1082
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:32,705 
Peeled his
skin right off.

1083
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,609 
[screams continue]

1084
01:03:35,673 --> 01:03:39,146 
And Frankie, poisoned.

1085
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:44,954 
He tried to tear his
own tongue out of
his fucking mouth.

1086
01:03:45,015 --> 01:03:48,154 
It's some straight
evil shit, Taz.

1087
01:03:48,218 --> 01:03:50,590 
Think our
sins finally
caught up with us.

1088
01:03:50,654 --> 01:03:52,256 
Man, pull yourself
together, alright?

1089
01:03:52,322 --> 01:03:53,992 
I don't want Tia
to hear this shit.

1090
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,380 
You upset?

1091
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:15,948 
You were gonna snitch,
weren't ya?

1092
01:04:16,013 --> 01:04:17,649 
Breathe.

1093
01:04:17,715 --> 01:04:19,618 
Stick your
tongue out.

1094
01:04:19,683 --> 01:04:21,686 
Stick your
tongue out!

1095
01:04:21,752 --> 01:04:23,254 
Stick your
tongue out! !

1096
01:04:27,524 --> 01:04:29,059 
Why did
you do that?

1097
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:32,065 
Why do you gotta
kill everybody?

1098
01:04:32,129 --> 01:04:36,838 
He was good, man.
No one was
a threat.

1099
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:39,071 
You killed Eddie
and Frankie,
didn't you?

1100
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:42,343 
Hector said you
weren't the only
game in town.

1101
01:04:42,406 --> 01:04:44,510 
I bet you are now.

1102
01:04:44,575 --> 01:04:46,210 
Get rid of
the body.

1103
01:04:51,315 --> 01:04:53,852 
Cal. Shit's
out of control, man.

1104
01:04:53,918 --> 01:04:55,588 
You're mother fucking
right it is!

1105
01:04:55,653 --> 01:04:57,223 
Hector killed
Eddie and Frank,

1106
01:04:57,288 --> 01:04:59,859 
nobody knows where
Stanley is and that
Ieaves you.

1107
01:04:59,924 --> 01:05:01,694 
And nothing's
gonna happen
to you.

1108
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:03,027 
No, no, no,
it wasn't them, man.

1109
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:04,830 
They're killing
our people, man.

1110
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:06,063 
The peace is over.

1111
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:07,299 
What?

1112
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:09,501 
Taz, you getting
too fucking soft.

1113
01:05:09,566 --> 01:05:11,870 
I've been
runnin' this shit.

1114
01:05:11,936 --> 01:05:16,712 
Cal, listen to
me very carefully.

1115
01:05:16,774 --> 01:05:19,111 
Not this time,
boss man.

1116
01:05:19,177 --> 01:05:24,887 
I'm not asking,
you mother fucker.
I'm telling you!

1117
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:26,117 
What?

1118
01:05:26,184 --> 01:05:29,356 
Hello?
Fuck!

1119
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:33,327 
What are
you doing?

1120
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,160 
When I was a kid,

1121
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:37,396 
I thought you were the
best thing that coulda
happened to me.

1122
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:39,832 
I told you
I'm not
your father.

1123
01:05:39,897 --> 01:05:44,172 
Fuck you!
You're gonna
listen to me!

1124
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:47,074 
I loved you so much.

1125
01:05:47,138 --> 01:05:50,042 
I was your little boy.

1126
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:52,445 
Everything I learned
about right and wrong,
you taught me.

1127
01:05:52,509 --> 01:05:54,512 
Mm-hm.

1128
01:05:54,578 --> 01:05:56,214 
Getting into this life,

1129
01:05:56,281 --> 01:06:00,088 
I knew
exactly what
I was doing.

1130
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:03,824 
Maybe if I'd had
a better start,

1131
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:05,557 
this coulda had
a better conclusion.

1132
01:06:05,622 --> 01:06:06,790 
[chuckles]

1133
01:06:06,857 --> 01:06:08,627 
Now I gotta
go stop Cal.

1134
01:06:08,692 --> 01:06:13,001 
You still don't
understand, do you?

1135
01:06:13,064 --> 01:06:14,833 
You made a deal
with the devil.

1136
01:06:14,898 --> 01:06:19,507 
The most evil
entity known
to God or man.

1137
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:21,840 
You can't just
turn that shit off.

1138
01:06:21,905 --> 01:06:26,247 
The floodgates
of hell are open

1139
01:06:26,311 --> 01:06:29,951 
So whet her I'm
with you or not

1140
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:34,757 
I still have
to do his will.

1141
01:06:34,818 --> 01:06:41,865 
Nothing -nothing will
jeopardize you becoming
king of the avenue.

1142
01:06:41,926 --> 01:06:45,232 
Cal's about to fuck up.

1143
01:06:45,296 --> 01:06:47,166 
And everyone
that fucks up,
you kill.

1144
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:48,334 
U h-huh.

1145
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:49,434 
Not Cal.
That's my heart.

1146
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,501 
Uh-huh.

1147
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:51,835 
Get the fuck
outta my way.

1148
01:06:51,903 --> 01:06:53,839 
No.

1149
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:57,044 
I got no problem
putting an end to
this nightmare right now.

1150
01:06:57,108 --> 01:07:00,547 
This should definitely
jeopardize me being
king of the ave? Huh?

1151
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:16,731 
I don't see Taz.

1152
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:18,430 
That's not a good sign.

1153
01:07:18,495 --> 01:07:19,931 
I will see
what he wants.

1154
01:07:39,784 --> 01:07:41,720 
Where's Hector?
Is he in the truck?

1155
01:07:41,786 --> 01:07:45,125 
Don't worry about that.
[indistinct].

1156
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:48,029 
Is he in
the fucking truck?

1157
01:07:48,093 --> 01:07:49,094 
No, he's not.

1158
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,295 
Yeah?

1159
01:07:50,361 --> 01:07:52,064 
Yeah.

1160
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,131 
I think he is.

1161
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:57,502 
[gunshot]

1162
01:07:59,304 --> 01:08:03,078 
Go! Go!

1163
01:08:03,141 --> 01:08:08,251 
[gunfire]

1164
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:11,285 
Parking lot on 3rd.
Kill everything you see.

1165
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:16,025 
[engine speeds up,
tires screech]

1166
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:19,493 
I fuckin' told ya!

1167
01:08:19,556 --> 01:08:20,959 
Let's get
the fuck
outta here.

1168
01:08:21,025 --> 01:08:22,360 
We gotta burn
him up first.

1169
01:08:22,427 --> 01:08:23,763 
What? Pops!
We gotta go!

1170
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:25,463 
You fucked around
and let him grab
your arm.

1171
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:26,999 
You got too
close to him.

1172
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:28,968 
Now you got
hair, particles,
and shit all over you.

1173
01:08:29,033 --> 01:08:30,903 
Those forensic dicks
are gonna find
that shit.

1174
01:08:30,969 --> 01:08:32,538 
What do I do?

1175
01:08:32,604 --> 01:08:35,241 
Here, take
the fucking gun
and go to the car.

1176
01:08:35,306 --> 01:08:36,474 
Shit.

1177
01:08:44,816 --> 01:08:47,688 
Pop's crazy.
He's back there
burning up the body.

1178
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:50,356 
Body? What'd
do you do?

1179
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:51,757 
I smoked the loud mouth.

1180
01:08:51,823 --> 01:08:53,392 
Oh, no.

1181
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:54,326 
He told me Hector
wasn't in the truck,
but I knew he was.

1182
01:08:54,392 --> 01:08:55,460 
You fucked up, man!

1183
01:08:55,527 --> 01:08:56,528 
Man, they killed!

1184
01:08:56,594 --> 01:08:59,098 
Cal! It
wasn't them.

1185
01:08:59,164 --> 01:09:00,901 
You killed
all those bosses

1186
01:09:00,965 --> 01:09:02,467 
and everything
just fell into place.

1187
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:04,704 
That was
brilliant, Taz.

1188
01:09:04,769 --> 01:09:07,240 
I just wanted to do
like you did.

1189
01:09:07,305 --> 01:09:09,008 
I gotta go.

1190
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:28,695 
# Swing low #

1191
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,166

# Comin' for to
Carry me home #

1193
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:40,240 
# Swing low #

1194
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:44,647 
# Sweet chariot #

1195
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:46,178 
# Comin' for
To carry me home ##

1196
01:09:46,244 --> 01:09:47,680 
Cal!

1197
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:03,197 
No!

1198
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:06,768 
No! !

1199
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:08,534 
Cal! !

1200
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,710 
[demon chuckles]

1201
01:10:50,775 --> 01:10:52,645 
Where you
going, mother fucker?

1202
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:54,947 
Fuck! You're
not real.

1203
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:58,820 
I'm real enough
to make you kill.

1204
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:00,319 
Mm-hm.

1205
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:04,427 
I made you
kill Eddie.

1206
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,493 
Frankie.

1207
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:10,432 
That Stanley,
who by the way,
is still in the trunk

1208
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:12,533 
[ahhh ahhhh]

1209
01:11:12,598 --> 01:11:14,835 
And then there's
your boy, Cal.

1210
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:19,275 
Oh, yeah.
Double bless 'em.

1211
01:11:19,338 --> 01:11:21,575 
He really
Ioved you,

1212
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,914 
And how about
poor little Tia?

1213
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:27,947 
Oh, you don't
remember that, huh?

1214
01:11:28,012 --> 01:11:32,121 
All that little girl
wanted to do
was love you.

1215
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:36,859 
I make you see
what I want you
to see.

1216
01:11:36,921 --> 01:11:39,693 
And I make you
do what I want
you to do.

1217
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:41,760 
[gunfire]

1218
01:11:41,826 --> 01:11:45,833 
And you have the audacity
to say I'm not real? Ha!

1219
01:11:45,897 --> 01:11:49,137 
I'm as real
as it gets.

1220
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:52,473 
Your whole damn life
is one big tragedy!

1221
01:11:52,538 --> 01:11:54,775 
Son, you dysfunctional.

1222
01:11:54,839 --> 01:11:59,081 
You had to create
a mother fucker like
me to protect you.

1223
01:11:59,144 --> 01:12:00,946 
Just like your
daddy said.

1224
01:12:01,013 --> 01:12:03,550 
I told you I ain't
raisin' no punk.

1225
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:08,391 
The punk is exactly
what you became.

1226
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:11,226 
Until I came along.

1227
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,127 
Until De'Sha
came along.

1228
01:12:13,192 --> 01:12:15,596 
Then nobody
fucked with Taz.

1229
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:17,664 
Yeah, you kept me
hidden all these years

1230
01:12:17,729 --> 01:12:19,599 
but then I had
to come out!

1231
01:12:19,665 --> 01:12:21,435 
Get out of
my fucking head!

1232
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,572 
I'm your daddy.
I'm just fuckin'
with ya.

1233
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:26,639 
And I'm always
gonna be fuckin'
with ya.

1234
01:12:26,705 --> 01:12:28,575 
Because I like
to fuck with people.

1235
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,316 
So I'm always
gonna fuck
with ya.

1236
01:12:33,379 --> 01:12:34,481 
[blows]

1237
01:12:41,553 --> 01:12:43,023 
[crash]

1238
01:12:43,088 --> 01:12:45,826 
[horn honks]

1239
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:57,839 
(lady)
Are you okay?

1240
01:13:03,342 --> 01:13:05,345 
Amanda!

1241
01:13:05,411 --> 01:13:06,981 
Amanda! !

1242
01:13:07,045 --> 01:13:08,647 
Amanda, baby, baby!

1243
01:13:08,714 --> 01:13:09,783 
Oh my God.

1244
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:11,283 
I killed everybody.
It was me.

1245
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,087 
I fucked up.

1246
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:17,657 
What are you
talking about?

1247
01:13:17,723 --> 01:13:18,724 
You gotta get out
of here, baby.

1248
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:19,926 
He's gonna
kill you too.

1249
01:13:19,992 --> 01:13:21,795 
Who? What are
you talking about?

1250
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,799 
My Dad.
He came back as
a demon or me.

1251
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:25,965 
I don't fuckin' know!

1252
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:28,736 
Taz. Your
daddy's dead.

1253
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:29,736 
You're just
upset because

1254
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:31,872 
No, that was me!

1255
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:33,572 
You're really
scaring me.

1256
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:35,744 
You're covered
in blood.

1257
01:13:35,808 --> 01:13:37,610 
Not my blood.

1258
01:13:37,676 --> 01:13:39,446 
It's Cal's.

1259
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:40,881 
He made me
kill Cal.

1260
01:13:40,946 --> 01:13:43,183 
Daddy?

1261
01:13:43,248 --> 01:13:45,118 
Don't let him
see me like this!

1262
01:13:45,184 --> 01:13:48,089 
Go up to
your room!

1263
01:13:48,153 --> 01:13:51,660 
Mommy and Daddy
are just talking.

1264
01:13:51,724 --> 01:13:53,928 
Whatever is going on,
I can help you.

1265
01:13:53,992 --> 01:13:56,262 
Baby, listen to me.
You gotta get Norman

1266
01:13:56,328 --> 01:13:57,731 
and get the fuck
out of here.

1267
01:13:57,797 --> 01:13:59,199 
Why, Taz??
I love you! !

1268
01:13:59,264 --> 01:14:03,238 
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me why?

1269
01:14:03,302 --> 01:14:06,574 
Baby.
[sigh]

1270
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:08,909 
I'm a drug dealer.

1271
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:11,679 
One of the biggest drug
dealers on the Florida coast.

1272
01:14:11,744 --> 01:14:15,250 
And -I kill people.

1273
01:14:15,314 --> 01:14:18,153 
A lot of people.

1274
01:14:18,217 --> 01:14:22,258 
And 30 miles from here,
I got another house with
a girlfriend named Tia.

1275
01:14:22,321 --> 01:14:23,791 
I killed her too.

1276
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:26,861 
And I was the one
who dug up my
dad's remains.

1277
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:30,131 
And that's the dead body
of one of my drug lords
in the trunk of my car.

1278
01:14:30,195 --> 01:14:34,069 
Baby, the demon in my head,
he makes me do things
so listen to me.

1279
01:14:34,132 --> 01:14:36,670 
Get Norman
and get the fuck
outta here! Now, okay?

1280
01:14:36,736 --> 01:14:38,271 
Go! Go!!

1281
01:14:38,337 --> 01:14:39,372 
Go.

1282
01:14:44,309 --> 01:14:47,549 
Uh-uh-uh.

1283
01:14:47,614 --> 01:14:51,187 
Now what the fuck
did you do that for?

1284
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,120 
You told
her everything.

1285
01:14:53,185 --> 01:14:56,124 
Now you have
to kill her

1286
01:14:56,188 --> 01:14:57,758 
and your son.

1287
01:14:57,824 --> 01:14:58,859 
No.

1288
01:14:58,924 --> 01:15:00,961 
Mm-hm. You
have to.

1289
01:15:01,026 --> 01:15:02,228 
She knows everything.

1290
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:03,630 
Fuck you!

1291
01:15:03,696 --> 01:15:06,668 
No! Fuck you!

1292
01:15:06,733 --> 01:15:08,970 
Wasn't my fault
that you told
her everything.

1293
01:15:09,034 --> 01:15:10,737 
Now I'm a-give
you a option.

1294
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:14,042 
You can go in there,
put one in the back
of their heads, painless,

1295
01:15:14,106 --> 01:15:17,345 
or you know
how I work.

1296
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:19,580 
No.

1297
01:15:19,646 --> 01:15:22,083 
# Swing low #

1298
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:24,485 
# Sweet chariot #

1299
01:15:24,551 --> 01:15:25,653 
You're not
gonna hurt them.

1300
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:30,926 
# Comin' fo' to
Carry me home #

1301
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:32,525 
Amanda, go!

1302
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:34,061 
Fuck! !

1303
01:15:34,126 --> 01:15:35,929 
Daddy?

1304
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:37,731 
No! !

1305
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:41,404 
# Comin' fo'
to carry
me home #

1306
01:15:53,613 --> 01:15:56,050 
Now my son
will grow up
without a father,

1307
01:15:56,114 --> 01:15:58,519 
without the
proper guidance,

1308
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:03,328 
He'll always wonder
''What if my dad
was here?''

1309
01:16:03,389 --> 01:16:05,760 
I'm sure one day
Amanda will find
someone eJse.

1310
01:16:05,825 --> 01:16:07,295 
She's a good woman,

1311
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,831 
so she'll probably
find a good man,

1312
01:16:09,896 --> 01:16:12,635 
And they'll raise
my son without me,

1313
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:17,442 
But I know
nobody will ever
Iove them like I did,

1314
01:16:17,503 --> 01:16:21,777 
And under different
circumstances, we
could've been so happy,

1315
01:16:21,841 --> 01:16:25,113 
But I guess we'll never
know the answer to that,

1316
01:16:25,177 --> 01:16:28,717 
'Cause I wasn't strong
enough to break
the cycle,

1317
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:29,749 
Are you?

1318
01:16:48,635 --> 01:16:51,340
