1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,038
Five continents.

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,007
12 countries.

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,508
19 cities.

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,976
50,000 miles.

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,044
Five characters.

6
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,312
One dead terrorist.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,380
We're all over the map.

Subtitle by JustCosmin

9
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,655
Hey, guys.

10
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,058
I just completed the longest
and biggest tour I've ever been

11
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,427
on, and I couldn't have done
it without my wife Audrey,

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,263
who's travelled everywhere, or
without my friend Jeff Rothpan,

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,566
who's never traveled further
than his own mailbox.

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,069
Was I little concerned about
doing shows in the Far East,

15
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,804
and Africa, and the Middle East?

16
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,840
No, I was a lot concerned.

17
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:46,779
But the adventures
all began in Iceland.

18
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,547
Walt, I'm just impressed
that all these folks

19
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,681
came out for our show tonight?

20
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,549
-Well, don't be?

21
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,216
-Why?

22
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:51,884
-Well, it's Iceland.

23
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:52,851
It's not you or us.

24
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,353
There's nothing else to do here.

25
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,723
[laughter]

26
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,464
-You know that Iceland has
one of the highest life

27
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,866
expectancies in
the entire world?

28
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:08,867
-I did not know that.

29
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,735
-Especially women.

30
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,769
-Yeah?

31
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:11,670
-Yeah, here a woman's
average lifespan

32
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,539
and is 90 to 100 years.

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,844
-Send my wife home immediately.

34
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:22,981
What is this?

35
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,715
Hell on earth?

36
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,754
-How do you like the food here?

37
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,590
-Oh, very funny.

38
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,059
I tried some of that--
what do you called that?

39
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,628
Hakharl hacaral hakaral.

40
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,834
You cannot speak Icelandic
without moving your lips,

41
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,734
I'm telling you.

42
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,439
Think of that.

43
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,408
There's no Icelandic
ventriloquist ever.

44
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,116
I will say, though, I think the
folks of Iceland are geniuses.

45
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,217
-How's that?

46
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,451
-They know how to
keep it from getting

47
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,120
overcrowded with foreigners.

48
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,187
-How's that?

49
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,458
-Simply by naming
the place Iceland.

50
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,928
It sounds like you'll
freeze your ass off.

51
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,632
Plus it's easier to say than
the dark long winter land

52
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,768
where the weather is [beep].

53
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,572
We're morons for naming our
country the United States.

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,307
Sounds way too welcoming.

55
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,577
We should've called our country
crazy assholes with guns.

56
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,045
[laughter]

57
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,581
[applause]

58
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,617
-Did you get a chance
to go to a volcano?

59
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,851
-Oh, yes I did.

60
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,685
-Did you take your wife?

61
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,486
-Yes, I did.

62
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,721
-What'd she think?

63
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,556
-She kept saying the
same thing over and over.

64
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,357
-What?

65
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,092
-Stop trying to push me in.

66
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,265
-Did you know that every
single city in Iceland

67
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,700
is named after the
sound a cat makes

68
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,002
when throwing up a hair ball?

69
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,372
[laughter]

70
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,109
I learned that.

71
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,143
-That's not true.

72
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:58,944
-Oh?

73
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,379
Reygoovableh.

74
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,749
[laughter]

75
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:04,483
There it is.

76
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,921
-Even though it's
named Iceland, did you

77
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,490
know the winters here
are actually fairly mild?

78
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,257
-No.

79
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,258
-Mm-hm.

80
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,460
-Oh.

81
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,962
Guess they should
have called it Chile.

82
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,199
[laughter]

83
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,136
-Have you seen the colors
of the Icelandic flag?

84
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,971
-Uh, no, I haven't seen it.

85
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,673
-There's red for
the volcanic fires.

86
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,107
-Oh, that's good.

87
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,576
-Blue for the mountains
in the distance.

88
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,376
-Yeah.

89
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,044
-And white--

90
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,911
-For the people.

91
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,782
[laughter]

92
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,932
-OK, did you know they have
the oldest tree in Norway

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,833
right here in Bergen.

94
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,567
-Fascinating.

95
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,974
If I want to see them old
wood, I'll take a Viagra.

96
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,743
[laughter]

97
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,711
Thank you.

98
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,080
Thank you.

99
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:08,981
Thank you.

100
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,921
-Did you know the first ever
ski jumper was from Norway?

101
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,256
-Let me guess,
married and miserable?

102
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,694
-So you've never
been snow skiing?

103
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,263
-Actually, yes, once.

104
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,364
Broke a leg.

105
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,732
-Oh, I bet that hurt.

106
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,532
-I don't know.

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,002
Wasn't my leg.

108
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,639
-Do you know where I can buy
some whiskey around here?

109
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,440
-Well, in Norway you
can only buy liquor

110
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,777
from special stores
called, uh, good god.

111
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,880
[laughter]

112
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:46,351
Vin-- how do you say it?

113
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,085
Yeah, that.

114
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:54,960
-There are none-- nur
none hur dun nur dun.

115
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,895
-So we've done a lot
of interesting things

116
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,163
while in Norway.

117
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,332
-This morning I milked a goat.

118
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,733
-Oh?

119
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,536
-Achmed got mad at me.

120
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,071
I think I was
touching his chick.

121
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,575
-So while we're here.

122
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,177
-Wait, I want to
ask you something.

123
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,011
Can we go to Ikea?

124
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,548
-This is Norway.

125
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,582
Ikea is in Sweden.

126
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,917
-Oh, too bad.

127
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,020
I wanted to give Ikea a
new advertising slogan.

128
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:22,888
-And what's that?

129
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:23,889
-I-keel-you.

130
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:28,760
[laughter]

131
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,868
-So Achmed, did you know the
biathlon is popular here?

132
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,637
-What is this biathlon?

133
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,205
It's where you ski
and shoot a gun.

134
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:40,972
-Oh!

135
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,174
Yes, of course.

136
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:46,712
But in Los Angeles, you
drive and shoot a gun.

137
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,780
-I also learned today that
the Vikings put their dead

138
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,082
on a boat and sent
them out to sea.

139
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:50,916
-Yes, of course.

140
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,285
The first Norwegian Cruise Line.

141
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,722
[laughter]

142
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,042
-So have you learned much about
Ireland since we got here?

143
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,080
-I'd say Americans and the
Irish pretty much think alike.

144
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,482
-How's that?

145
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,485
-Most of us think our government
should take flying [beep] leap.

146
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,420
[laughter]

147
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,190
[applause]

148
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,497
-Well, besides politics, did
you know that Bram Stoker who

149
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,565
created Dracula is from Dublin?

150
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,400
-Oh really?

151
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,536
No, Dracula.

152
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,004
Dracula?

153
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,273
You mean the guy who sleeps
all day, goes out every night,

154
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,341
and can't stop drinking?

155
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,077
[laughter]

156
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,347
[applause]

157
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,653
Wonder where Stoker
got that idea?

158
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,822
I once picked up an
Irish hitchhiker.

159
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,623
-You did?

160
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,290
-Yeah.

161
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:05,957
-Where was he going?

162
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:06,792
-Rehab.

163
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,126
[laughter]

164
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,462
[applause]

165
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,631
Seems like he was Irish.

166
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,899
[gibberish]

167
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:18,036
[laughter]

168
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,910
[gibberish]

169
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,111
-You're not saying anything.

170
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,546
-No, but they can understand me.

171
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,780
[laughter]

172
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,251
[applause]

173
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,053
-So what do you think
about Dublin so far?

174
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,957
-Oh, duh, dur, uh, this
is the land of beer.

175
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:39,958
-That's right.

176
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,461
-I know we're going
to Israel soon,

177
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,763
but while we've
been here in Dublin,

178
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,599
I've seen pubs
everywhere, so I'm

179
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,068
pretty sure this
is the Holy Land.

180
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,970
[laughter]

181
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,240
[applause]

182
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,914
And this is the biggest
alcoholics anonymous meeting

183
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,115
I've ever been to.

184
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,120
-I have a joke.

185
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,422
-All right.

186
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,924
-What do you call
women in Ireland?

187
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,892
-I don't know.

188
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,327
What do you call
women in Ireland?

189
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,262
-You call them women,
you chauvinist bastard.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,069
-We landed in Belfast the
other day, and I'm like what?

191
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:24,936
Belfast?

192
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,538
Am I here for a job interview.

193
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,274
[laughter]

194
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,244
[applause]

195
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,446
I love Dublin.

196
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,549
I would never do
anything evil to Dublin.

197
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,483
-Really?

198
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,485
-I'm afraid of the soccer fans.

199
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,989
[laughter]

200
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,324
But have you looked
at this audience?

201
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,292
-Yes.

202
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,628
-Closely.

203
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,729
When the lights are out?

204
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:51,897
-Yes.

205
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,733
-I am made entirely
out of bone and teeth,

206
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,768
and my color actually blends in.

207
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,670
[laughter]

208
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,507
[applause]

209
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,609
-All right, Achmed, look, as
everybody was coming tonight,

210
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,578
they were given an opportunity
or two to ask you a question.

211
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,913
-Yes.

212
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,649
-And everybody wrote them
down, and before the show

213
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,184
we grabbed a handful, and I
think you should answer them?

214
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,486
-Okie dokie.

215
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,688
-Dear Achmed, does Guinness
go right through you?

216
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,190
[laughter]

217
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,125
-You asshole!

218
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,096
Yes!

219
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,598
And so does potatoes--

220
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,034
[laughter]

221
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,068
Corned beef and
[bleep] sunlight.

222
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,150
-Isn't England where
Mary Poppins is from.

223
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,451
-It took place in London.

224
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,352
-Oh yeah, OK.

225
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,320
Yeah.

226
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,387
You know, I dated
her for a while.

227
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,327
-You dated Mary Poppins?

228
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,127
-Yes, I did.

229
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:56,695
-No.

230
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,395
-Yeah, I did.

231
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,229
We were very young.

232
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,298
-Oh really?

233
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,002
-I was the first guy to get
into her chim chim cher-ee.

234
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,305
[laughter]

235
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,611
Kinda ruined things when
in the moment of passion

236
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,813
she started screaming
some weird word.

237
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,484
It was like super
California refrigerator

238
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,086
x the delicious lotion.

239
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,055
Something like that.

240
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,626
-Uh, I love this country
because just about everything

241
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,628
is double entendre.

242
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,428
-Like what?

243
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:30,996
-Oh, come on.

244
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:31,630
Even the food.

245
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,464
Bangers and mash?

246
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,200
Come on!

247
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,002
-That's sausages and potatoes.

248
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,172
-It sounds more like
a male dance team.

249
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,709
Or two guys dating.

250
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,380
I don't want to be
mash, all right?

251
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,416
-Did you know that the very
first x-ray was take right here

252
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,852
in Birmingham, England in 1896?

253
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,020
-Ha!

254
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:59,824
You call it an x-ray,
I call it a selfie.

255
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,292
-So what did you do today?

256
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,630
-I saw where they keep all
those useless wax figures.

257
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,965
-Ah, Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.

258
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,766
-No, no, no.

259
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,533
Parliament.

260
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,901
[laughter]

261
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:14,305
[applause]

262
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,907
-With that in mind,
have you learned

263
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,575
anything since we've been here?

264
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,311
-Uh, I've learned that
the folks in Birmingham

265
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,881
like to be called Birmies.

266
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,316
-Right.

267
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,786
-So I took that
knowledge forward.

268
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,854
Unfortunately, the
folks in Scotland

269
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,356
do not like to be
called Scummies.

270
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,796
Oh, they got all pissed off.

271
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,297
I don't know what the
hell they were saying.

272
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,832
You ever try to talk
to an angry Scot?

273
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,400
Good god.

274
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,736
[angry gibberish]

275
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,410
The [bleep] are you saying?

276
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,348
, so what do you
think of Liverpool so far?

277
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,450
-Having a good time.

278
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,820
Yeah, lots of Beatles stuff.

279
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,456
-Well, this is the original
home of the Beatles.

280
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,359
-Yeah, do Paul and Ringo
ever get back here,

281
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,330
or are they still trying to
avoid running into Pete Best?

282
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,066
[laughter]

283
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,638
-For those who might be
watching and not be familiar,

284
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,607
Pete Best was the
original drummer

285
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,075
for The Beatles before--

286
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,111
-Before they dumped
his ass and got Ring.

287
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,012
-That's right.

288
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,147
-That had to suck.

289
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,183
You think he's over it by now?

290
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,351
-I don't know.

291
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,753
You know they named a
street after Pete Best.

292
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,422
-Oh, well, yes, great.

293
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,191
[laughter]

294
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,563
That's got to make up for the
millions of dollars and pounds,

295
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,333
don't you think?

296
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,667
What the hell's the
name of the street?

297
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:50,835
You got screwed boulevard?

298
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,974
-Did you know that it was in
Liverpool that scientists first

299
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,009
discovered that malaria
was spread by mosquitoes?

300
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,318
-That's just fascinating, Jeff.

301
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,987
Let's put that on
the welcome signs.

302
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,789
[laughter]

303
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:11,990
That'll bring in the tourists.

304
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:12,791
Come to Liverpool!

305
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,461
We have Beatles and mosquitoes!

306
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,731
And one of them carries
a deadly disease!

307
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,167
Find out which one!

308
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:22,901
Ringo?

309
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,015
-I know a little fact.

310
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,383
Did you know that
people in Scotland

311
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,652
by 40 bottles of
whiskey every second?

312
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,324
-This is my favorite
country ever.

313
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,567
Do they NASCAR in the uck?

314
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,801
-In the what?

315
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:57,669
-In the uck?

316
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,208
-The-- oh, UK.

317
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,644
-Oh, you can spell.

318
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,016
-But Glasgow is, uh-- you told
me it was confusing for you?

319
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:12,817
-Yeah, it is.

320
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,952
-Why?

321
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,221
-Yesterday at lunch
my waitress asked me

322
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,957
if I wanted some
tatties and neeps.

323
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,692
[laughter]

324
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,628
When I said yes, instead
of taking off her top,

325
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,863
she brought me food.

326
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,366
[laughter]

327
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,769
[applause]

328
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:37,175
It was the worst strip
club I'd ever been to.

329
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,310
-Tatties and neeps are
served with haggis.

330
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,246
-Well, he didn't
show me that either.

331
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,516
-We've been talking
about Scotland a bit.

332
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,918
-Oh yes?

333
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,888
-I read the other day that
Scotland is actually the-- I've

334
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,390
saved this fact for you--
the murder capital of Europe.

335
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,293
[gasp]

336
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,361
-I didn't do it!

337
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,064
I have nothing to
do with this shit!

338
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,333
Did you know that
bagpipes have existed

339
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,335
in Scotland since
the 14th century?

340
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,737
-Oh!

341
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,773
That is probably about the
time the murder rate went up.

342
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,011
[bagpipe noises]

343
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,221
Did you know that I think
my mother was part Scottish?

344
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,022
-Yeah?

345
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,290
Why do you say that?

346
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,692
-Sometimes she'd want to
put me in Scottish clothing?

347
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,526
-Really?

348
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,762
-Sure, she'd say I kilt you.

349
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,629
[laughter]

350
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,530
Kilt?

351
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:32,931
Kilt?

352
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:33,598
Get it?

353
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,399
Kilt?

354
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,002
I kilt you.

355
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,406
[applause]

356
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,417
-By the time I was done,
I was 104 degrees out,

357
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,385
and I was sweating like a pig.

358
00:15:54,453 --> 00:16:01,292
And-- what happened?

359
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,127
What?

360
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,130
Wait a minute-- oh
I can't say pig?

361
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:06,931
What?

362
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,732
I don't what to say.

363
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,666
I don't-- forget it.

364
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,201
Just-- I don't know anything.

365
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,971
What the [bleep] are
they talking about?

366
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:13,771
Don't say pig?

367
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,039
Is that it?

368
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,909
OK, I was sweating like a goat.

369
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,043
[laughter]

370
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:19,777
All right.

371
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:28,619
-Holy crap.

372
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,900
You're not gonna, erm--

373
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,135
-What are you trying to say?

374
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,071
-You're not-- [mumbling].

375
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:47,872
No Achmed.

376
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,240
No Achmed.

377
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,642
[laughter]

378
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,479
[applause]

379
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,955
Can you not [bleep]
see out there?

380
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,091
-I will talk to Achmed
about this later.

381
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,427
-No, no, no.

382
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,064
Can I, uh, get in the box and
get the [bleep] out first?

383
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,832
[laughter]

384
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,636
[applause]

385
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,373
It's not a good idea.

386
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,241
We're not in Israel.

387
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,008
-I know.

388
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,347
But have you been enjoying
the sights around town?

389
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,181
-Oh, yeah sure.

390
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,015
Amazing.

391
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,784
Gorgeous buildings.

392
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:33,618
-Gorgeous buildings.

393
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,419
-Yeah.

394
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,887
-Amazing structures.

395
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,688
Fantastic hotels.

396
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,259
Been looking forward to this a
lot, and here we are in a tent.

397
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,733
-Yeah, they know how to treat
the infidels, don't they?

398
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,068
[laughter]

399
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,869
[applause]

400
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,372
A frickin tent.

401
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,173
-It's a nice--

402
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,741
-Yeah, a nice tent.

403
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,410
Yay.

404
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,378
It's a frickin circus tent.

405
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,146
[laughter]

406
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,716
All we're missing is
the [bleep] music.

407
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,419
Here's Jeff and Walter.

408
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,055
[laughter]

409
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,560
This sucks.

410
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,694
-It's a fine facility.

411
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,528
-OK, all right.

412
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,430
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,399
I guess we're
actually safe though.

414
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,233
-How's that?

415
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,035
-What moron would bomb a tent?

416
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:29,907
What do you do?

417
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,676
What do you-- cause
$20 worth of damage?

418
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,881
-I don't know who owns
this, but if it's one guy,

419
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,049
he might be here tonight.

420
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,884
-Oh good, he's gonna
go home to his palace,

421
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,452
and here we are in [bleep] tent.

422
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,186
-All right!

423
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,260
-So Bubba J, do you know
where we are exactly?

424
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,094
-Oh, no.

425
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:50,895
Sure don't.

426
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,196
No I don't.

427
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:52,930
-Abu Dhabi.

428
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,201
-What?

429
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,305
-Abu Dhabi.

430
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,306
-You're drunk.

431
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,275
[laughter]

432
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:08,946
[applause]

433
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:09,814
Really?

434
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:10,581
-Yeah.

435
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,749
-Say that again.

436
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,483
-Abu Dhabi.

437
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,221
-I thought that's
what Fred Flintstone

438
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,823
says when he's excited.

439
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,726
[laughter]

440
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,563
-No, that's yabba dabba do.

441
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,733
-It's pretty close.

442
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,700
Abu Dhabi do!

443
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,936
[laughter]

444
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,803
-Wait, wait!

445
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,704
Come back!
Come back!

446
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,438
Come back!

447
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:37,909
Come back!

448
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,117
You're the one of the guys
I really want to love me.

449
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,823
Is it the red cape?

450
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,958
Something wrong with that?

451
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,226
Did I say ham?

452
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,795
[laughter]

453
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,032
Oh my god, your
name is offensive!

454
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:01,899
Dun-ham!

455
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,869

00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,772
[applause]

457
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,176
Is he coming back?

458
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,411
Did he have to go potty?

459
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,316
Do you pick it up
or pull it down?

460
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,219
[laughter]

461
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,589
[applause]

462
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,962
Or is there a little flap?

463
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:42,974
-Good evening, Abu Dhabi
infi-- I mean, folks.

464
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,744
[laughter]

465
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,280
Silence, I kill you!

468
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,157
What the hell?

469
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:04,161
What-- I threaten to kill
them, they all go yay.

470
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,998
-I think some of them
actually like you here.

471
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,466
-Really?

472
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,768
[applause]

473
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,906
You know, since being
here, I've been starting

474
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,043
to rethink the whole
suicide bomber thing.

475
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,411
-How's that?

476
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,481
-I blew myself to get a new
place and a few versions,

477
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,483
meanwhile eight guys
in the front row

478
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,687
here have five matches
each, a bunch of hot wives,

479
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,257
and their own skin.

480
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,294
I had no idea these
options were available.

481
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,233
JEFF DUNHAM: I love you guys.

482
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:42,967
Good night.

483
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,740
-Welcome to Israel!

484
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,180
[shouts]

485
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:00,584

486
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,592
-Where the hell are we?

487
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,062
[laughter]

488
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,465
[applause]

489
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,767
I forgot, yeah, we're here.

490
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:23,808
OK, well, uh, uh, um, shalom.

491
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,813
[applause]

492
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,651
I'm surprised at how many
them in here have facial hair.

493
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,785
JEFF DUNHAM: Well, that's true.

494
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,454
-Yeah, we went to
the market today,

495
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,256
and it took me 10 minutes to
pick my wife out of the crowd.

496
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,758
[laughter]

497
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,327
[applause]

498
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,396
-So Achmed, we've been
going all over the place.

499
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,163
-We have.

500
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,565
-You know where we are?

501
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,867
-Well, we have going so many
places I have lost track.

502
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:55,072
And, uh, we-- uh.

503
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,207
What's with all the Jews?

504
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,879
-We're in Israel.

505
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:02,713
-That's so funny.

506
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,481
Yeah, OK.

507
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,882
Israel.

508
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,283
Yeah, that's really funny.

509
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,184
We're in-- what?

510
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,656
-We're in Tel Aviv.

511
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,492
[whimper]

512
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,196
-As in Israeli Army?

513
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,998
[laughter]

514
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,367
Holy crap.

515
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,136
Well, I'm already dead.

516
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,605
What the hell?

517
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,308
[applause]

518
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,143
-Achmed, trust me.

519
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,010
You'll be fine.

520
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,078
We're guests.

521
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,548
-So they are friendly Jews?

522
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,416
-Absolutely.

523
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,617
-Do they bite?

524
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,318
[laughter]

525
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,753
Can I play with one?

526
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,755
[laughter]

527
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,791
I actually studied about
Israel before we got here.

528
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,625
-Really?

529
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,893
-Yes.

530
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,428
This is where the letter
[guttural noise] comes from.

531
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,830
[laughter]

532
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,600

533
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,438
A-C-phlegm.

00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,545
You guys know this stuff.

00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,448
[applause]

536
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,250
Why do these folks cheer for me?

537
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,618
Oh, I get it.

538
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,988
You like nothing better
than a dead terrorist.

539
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,358
[applause]

540
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,465
I heard folks say that
Jews run the banks.

541
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,266
Well, I say good.

542
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,168
The Palestinians only
have the West Bank,

543
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,472
and that hasn't gone so well.

544
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,875
[applause]

545
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,280
Dear Achmed, can you
whistle the Hava Nagila?

551
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,347
Thanks for coming out!

552
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,226
[applause]

553
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:33,030
-What do you think of
South Africa so far?

554
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:33,831
-Honestly?

555
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,632
-Yeah.

556
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,234
-Not what I thought it would be.

557
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,335
-How's that?

558
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,238
-Look out there.

559
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,673
We're in Africa, right?

560
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,912
Lot of white folks out there.

561
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,814
[laughter]

562
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,651
[applause]

563
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,588
-It is South Africa.

564
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,823
-OK.

565
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,761
Thus the continent of Africa.

566
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:09,233
Well this is not what I
remember from the Tarzan movies.

567
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,435
What is your first name?

568
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,303
David?

569
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,340
And guys named David and Warren.

570
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,375
I don't think those
are African names.

571
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,412
[laughter]

572
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,614
I was expecting like
[click click whistle].

573
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,883
[laughter]

574
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,018
-You know, Bubba J,
Joburg is a lively city.

575
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,787
-Oh yeah, unless you get shot.

576
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,791
-Did you know that
South Africa has

577
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,060
the largest brewery
in the world?

578
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,028
[gasp]

579
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,998
[applause]

580
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,766
-The largest brewery?

581
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,006
I'm going to write a letter.

582
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:55,079
My dearest wife, for reasons
you will of course understand,

583
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,914
I am never coming home.

584
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,217
[laughter]

585
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,087
[applause]

586
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,525
So after you become a
citizen of the South Africa,

587
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,429
how long does it take for
your skin to turn black?

588
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,799
[laughter]

589
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,873
These guys early
on too, I think.

590
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,675
[applause]

591
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,543
-All right, you guys
have just been great.

592
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,511
What a crowd.

593
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,679
Thank you so much.

594
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,914
All right, let's turn up
the lights real quick.

595
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,882
Can we do the house lights?

596
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,017
Let's do this real quick?

597
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,785
Let's see what this
is gonna look like?

598
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:35,753
Oh yeah, this'll be great.

599
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,720
Hold on, let me get Achmed.

600
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,655
Hold on a second.

601
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,023
Can you do it sideways?

602
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,291
Is that good?

603
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,626
This way.

604
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,827
-You dumbass idiot, Jeff.

605
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,254
-Have you seen the size of
the bugs in this country?

606
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,088
[laughter]

607
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,189
-Yeah, there's some big ones.

608
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,757
-There was a beetle
in our hotel room,

609
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,459
and my wife wanted
me to step on it?

610
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,260
-What did you do?

611
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,661
-Nothing.

612
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,763
The damn thing grabbed my wife's
poodle and flew out the window.

613
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:20,731
[laughter]

614
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,632
I love this country.

615
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,770
-So what are the
differences you've

616
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,673
found between Australia
and the United States?

617
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,976
-Well, I think down here
my marriage goes down

618
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,979
the toilet in the
other direction.

619
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,714
Just guessing.

620
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,853
-Dear Achmed, my dream
was to see you and Jeff.

621
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,155
I've been waiting
for seven long years,

622
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,357
so because I've been waiting
so long, could I please

623
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,159
have a picture with both of you.

624
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,561
Thanks, Joann.

625
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,361
Joann, where are you?

626
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,663
Right there?

627
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,131
-Hehe, no.

628
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,101
[laughter]

629
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,335
-Come on, that's fine.

630
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,069
Come up here.

631
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,508
-OK, where's your camera?

632
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,043
-Um, my friend has it.

633
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,978
-Well, that doesn't
[bleep] help.

634
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,913
[laughter]

635
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,049
-OK, well take a
picture of the screen.

636
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,051
[laughter]

637
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,419
-Smile.

638
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,221
Stop looking at me and
rubbing your tits on my back.

639
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,655
[laughter]

640
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,960
[applause]

641
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,161
Because it's not my back.

642
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,596
It's his hand.

643
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,732
[laughter]

644
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,533
-Thank you.

645
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,634
-Actually do it again.

646
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:31,535
-No!

647
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,503
[laughter]

648
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,404
-I got your back.

649
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,372
And her front.

650
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,340
-I got it.

651
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,542
All right Terribly sorry.

652
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,643
-Your wife is backstage.
[laughter]

653
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,144
-I know.

654
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,111
[laughter]

655
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,247
-He took a feel
with his knuckles.

656
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,181
-No, I didn't!

657
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,186
-Fun coming up here, isn't it?

658
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,087
[laughter]

659
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:50,888
-You can get closer.

660
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,189
Just stand right next to Achmed.

661
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:56,059
-And don't rub your hooters.

662
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,095
Do not rub your
hooters on my scapula.

663
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,998
[laughter]

664
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,905
[applause]

665
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:10,974
I took a peak.

666
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,843
-I know.

667
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:13,777
-I see for you.

668
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:14,511
-Stop it.

669
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,483
OK, ready?

670
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,617
We'll smile, whoever
is taking the picture.

671
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,037
So Walter, what do you
think of Singapore so far?

672
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,372
-Uh, it's pretty crowded here.

673
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,640
-Oh yeah, that's true.

674
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,375
It's actually the
second most densely

675
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,010
populated country in the world.

676
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:47,744
-Oh.

677
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,251
Well, don't flatter yourself.

678
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,853
All these folks aren't
here to see you.

679
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,287
There was just no
room for them outside.

680
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,725
-What do you like
about Singapore so far?

681
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,595
Well, they have some tough laws.

682
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,029
-Oh, you heard about that?

683
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,164
Oh, yeah.

684
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,266
Yeah.

685
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,101
-Did you know you can
get fined or caned

686
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,371
for not flushing a
toilet after using it?

687
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,740
[laughter]

688
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:20,110
-And who the hell
checks up on that?

689
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,845
[laughter]

690
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,480
What, do you got
the [bleep] police?

691
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,216
[laughter]

692
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:30,254
It's the SSP, the
Singapore [bleep] police.

693
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,222
[laughter]

694
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,058
[applause]

695
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,561
I am not kidding.

696
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,830
How the hell do they know?

697
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,831
[sniff sniff]

698
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,332
Ah, that guy.

699
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,569
[laughter]

700
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:48,739
Is it a random check?

701
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:52,075
Or do they patrol the potties?

702
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:55,012
[bleep] duty.

703
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,247
Fred, you investigating
that murder today?

704
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,183
No, I have a tip that we
have a serial non-flusher.

705
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,719
[laughter]

706
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,057
-I hear you say earlier that
in Singapore if you break

707
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,525
certain laws they
beat you with a stick.

708
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,230
Well, maybe while
they're here, Jose

709
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,898
could pick up a
little extra work.

710
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,834
[laughter]

711
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:21,438
-So this has been a
fun tour around the--

712
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,739
where everywhere--
everywhere we went.

713
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:23,840
I love Singapore.

714
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,943
It's my favorite European city.

715
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,279
[laughter]

716
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,414
-Did you know they
have save water

717
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,848
campaign here in Singapore?

718
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:32,983
-Oh, well I know.

719
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,752
So today I drink
18 beers instead.

720
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,220
[laughter]

721
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:37,988
You're welcome.

722
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,696
So what's different
here than where we live?

723
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:49,266
-Well, I think religiously
there a lot more Buddhists here.

724
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,668
-Buddhists?

725
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,602
They all wear boots?

726
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,109
So what do they do?

727
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,678
-Well, for one they
believe in reincarnation.

728
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,846
-Re-incarceration?

729
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,882
[laughter]

730
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,953
You get out and suddenly
you're right back in.

731
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,789
[laughter]

732
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,324
-No, reincarnation.

733
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:19,029
That you can have entire past
lives you don't even remember.

734
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,230
That happened to me yesterday.

735
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,666
[laughter]

736
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,080
-We had a great show in
Singapore, we're packing up,

737
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,317
and Marnel, my tour manager
comes in to deliver some news.

738
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,285
And he's sweating.

739
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,887
-Hey, what's up?

740
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:44,921
-Come in.

741
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,658
-I've got some
information on Malaysia.

742
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,893
They're reviewing
several options,

743
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,997
and option A is
not going to be--

744
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,767
-Option A meaning
I can't use Achmed.

745
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,370
-It hasn't been defined by
the cultural-- what is it?

746
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,705
Cultural sensitivity.

747
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:02,939
-Hold it.

748
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,175
You're saying that these
guys-- who are these guys?

749
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,277
-It's actually one of
their religious leaders

750
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,746
that they had to fly to
another city to meet with them.

751
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,216
-I'm telling you I am the
lamb going to slaughter.

752
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,985
So they'll start
booing, and they're

753
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,420
not going to be booing me.

754
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,356
They're going to be booing the
fact that this is happening.

755
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,824
-They're probably aware
a lot of this stuff.

756
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,059
They're probably
used to restrictions.

757
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,293
-No, they're not.

758
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,828
-They're probably used to
living with [inaudible].

759
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,431
-We are promoting the show
with Achmed on the poster.

760
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,939
-Well, the main concern of
the Malaysian government

761
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:40,744
is that an artist is suitable
for the Malaysian culture.

762
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,713
Achmed is a little bit sensitive
to the Malaysian public.

763
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:47,517
We need to be careful
about what we put on stage.

764
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,154
The final ruling is that
Achmed the dead terrorist

765
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,390
is not allowed on stage.

766
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,068
-After we booked this
show, we were contacted

767
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:13,710
by the Malaysian ministry of
arts, and history, and culture.

768
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,048
And they asked me very
nicely and sternly

769
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,218
to not bring a certain
character to the show tonight.

770
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,755
[booing]

771
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:30,260
They even said please do
not even mention his name,

772
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,330
but I know that people are
here because you've seen stuff

773
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,199
on YouTube and you're expecting
to see a certain someone.

774
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:40,637
[applause]

775
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:45,075
However, I want to respect the
request because I am a guest

776
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,844
here, but at the same
time you paid your money

777
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,014
to see what you thought
you were going to see.

778
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,584
That certain person is not here.

779
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,788
However, his brother--

780
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,626
[applause]

781
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,366
--is here.

782
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,001
He is from France.

783
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,870
[laughter]

784
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,910
Please help me welcome
Jacques, the French terrorist.

785
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,280
[applause]

786
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,262
-Bonjour American pig.

787
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,131
[laughter]

788
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,265
-So you are French?

789
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,300
-Oui, oui.

790
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,434
C'est Francais.

791
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,335
-Uh-huh.

792
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,403
And your name is Jacques?

793
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,237
-Oui.

794
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,073
Je m'appelle Jacques.

795
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,843
[laughter]

796
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,679
-And what is your last name?

797
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,513
[bleep]

798
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,783
[laughter]

799
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,655
-What are they laughing at?

800
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,657
My name is Jacques [bleep].

801
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,659
[laughter]

802
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,562
[applause]

803
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,533
I do not understand what
they are laughing at.

804
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,834
[laughter]

805
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,271
-I think [bleep] is
translated into, uh--

806
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,409
-I am Jacques [bleep].

807
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,278
[laughter]

808
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,879
-Well, despite your name,
you seem like a nice guy.

809
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,281
-You don't know Jacques [bleep].

810
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,154
Wait, that is not funny!

811
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,022
[laughter]

812
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,156
-They're laughing.

813
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,560
-I kill you!

814
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:47,464
[applause]

815
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:48,798
-So you're happy to be here?

816
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,599
-No.

817
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,400
-Why is that?

818
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,637
-Where are we exactly?

819
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,507
Do not spit on my face,
you ugly American.

820
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,309
Where are we exactly?

821
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,110
-Kuala Lumpur.

822
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:00,977
-Oh, oui.

823
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,647
Kuala Lumpur.

824
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,447
Malaysia.

825
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,449
The weather here is [bleep].

826
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,385
[laughter]

827
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,820
[applause]

828
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,790
Where I am from
the weather is up.

829
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,025
Morning is up.

830
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,227
Afternoon and evening is up.

831
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,962
-I don't think the weather
in France is always hot.

832
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,364
-Eh, eh, eh, eh.

833
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,632
Do not question, Jacques.

834
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,805
It's not always hot in France?

835
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:29,606
-No.

836
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,740
-[bleep] OK.

837
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,177
[laughter]

838
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:38,248
[applause]

839
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,750
Let's just say for
the sake of the joke,

840
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,585
Francais is always
hot, hot, hot,

841
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,522
hot, hot, like a desert up.

842
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,523
[laughter]

843
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,824
Yes, you didn't
know that before?

844
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,726
There are pyramids, sand.

845
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,861
[laughter]

846
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,830
-Let me get something straight.

847
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,965
You're the brother
of the other guy

848
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:56,866
who was supposed to be here.

849
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:04,174
-Do not say his name, or we
are both in giant trouble.

850
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,977
[laughter]

851
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,548
Those guys are here.

852
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,989
-Dear Achmed, what is your
favorite Malaysian food?

853
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:24,260
[audience gasps]

854
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,005
-It has been nice knowing you.

855
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:39,876
[applause]

856
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,816
Kumbaya--

857
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,053
[laughter]

858
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,723
-Dear terrorist--

859
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,658
-That's not what you
said the first time.

860
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,994
[laughter]

861
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,296
When the show is done, run.

862
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,166
[laughter]

863
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,436
[applause]

864
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
-Someone named Spring.

865
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,008
Dear terrorist,
if you were given

866
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,411
the chance again to
be human, would you?

867
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,613
[gasp]

868
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,616
-I am not human?

869
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,417
-Not anymore.

870
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,951
-No?

871
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,454
-Do you know what
that makes you?

872
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,588
-A politician?

873
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,458
[laughter]

874
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,761
[applause]

875
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:38,067
But the ministry is a
lovely group of people.

876
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,636
[laughter]

877
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,571
-You guys have
been just awesome.

878
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,039
Thanks KL.

879
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,040
We'll see you.

880
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:44,974
Good night!

881
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,622
So we've been all over
the globe and I wanted

882
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,292
to end this special in the place
that's most important to me.

883
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,259
How could we not?

884
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,627
It's not a fancy stage.

885
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,329
In fact, a lot of the audience
is sitting in the mud.

886
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,163
It's bee raining.

887
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,264
They're sitting in the grass.

888
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,733
But here we are in
the land of the free

889
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,268
and the home of the brave.

890
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:16,906
Here we are at Joint
Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.
