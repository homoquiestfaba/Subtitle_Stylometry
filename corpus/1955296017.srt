1
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,381
Might want
to read this one.

2
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,782
Please tell me
it's double-spaced.

3
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,917
No such luck.

4
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,752
Where'd you get it?

5
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,621
A woman named aline Bernstein,
the stage designer?

6
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,791
The author's her protege.

7
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,227
Every other publisher in town
has already turned it down.

8
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,196
Is it any good?

9
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:17,863
Good?

10
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,631
No.

11
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,333
But it's unique.

12
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,837
A quick look.

13
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,606
Thanks, Max.
I'm in your debt.

14
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,396
602 to new canaan,
last call!

15
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,406
Good evening, Pete.
All aboard, Mr. Perkins.

16
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,313
<i> A stone, a leaf,</i>

17
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,714
<i> an unfound door</i>

18
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,020
<i> of a stone, a leaf, a door.</i>

19
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,289
<i> And of all</i>
<i> the forgotten faces.</i>

20
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,426
<i> Which of us has</i>
<i> known his brother?</i>

21
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,063
<i> Which of us has looked</i>
<i> into his father's heart?</i>

22
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:01,867
<i> Which of us has not remained</i>
<i> forever prison-pent?</i>

23
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:05,337
<i> Which of us is not</i>
<i> forever a stranger</i>
<i> and alone?</i>

24
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,582
<i> Remembering, speechlessly</i>
<i> we seek the great</i>
<i> forgotten language,</i>

25
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,585
<i> the lost Lane-end</i>
<i> into heaven,</i>

26
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,656
<i> a stone, a leaf,</i>
<i> an unfound door.</i>

27
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,459
<i> Where? When?</i>

28
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,494
<i> O lost,</i>

29
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,830
<i> and by the wind grieved,</i>

30
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,400
<i> ghost, come back again.</i>

31
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,813
<i> A destiny that leads</i>
<i> the English to the Dutch</i>
<i> is strange enough</i>

32
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,949
<i> but one that leads</i>
<i> from epsom into Pennsylvania</i>

33
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,819
<i> and thence into the hills</i>
<i> that shut in altamont</i>

34
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,888
<i> over the proud</i>
<i> coral cry of the cock</i>

35
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,625
<i> and the soft stone</i>
<i> smile of an angel</i>

36
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,794
<i> is touched by</i>
<i> that dark miracle</i>
<i> of chance.</i>

37
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,097
Hello, daddy!

38
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,498
Hello, ducks.

39
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,800
More rehearsal.

40
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,635
He didn't even notice us.

41
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,105
<i> "Fear no more</i>
<i> the heat o' the sun.</i>

42
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:16,007
<i> "Nor the furious</i>
<i> winter's rages.</i>

43
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,111

44
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,748
<i> "Home art gone,</i>

45
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,716
<i> "Golden lads and girls..."</i>

46
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,590
Jimmy, I told you already.
I don't like the movies.

47
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,658
I read books.

48
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,394
You're not listening to me.

49
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,733
<i> Subtract</i>
<i> us into nakedness</i>
<i> and night again</i>

50
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,771

<i> see begin in crete</i>
<i> 4,000 years ago,</i>

51
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,707
<i> the love that ended</i>
<i> yesterday in Texas.</i>

52
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,543
Hello, daddy.
How do I look?

53
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,612
Just beautiful.
It's
the prom next week.

54
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,681
Already? You're so old
and not married yet.

55
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,958
<i> O death in life</i>
<i> that turns our men to stone!</i>

56
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,997
<i> O change that</i>
<i> levels down our gods!</i>

57
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,098
Hello, Mr. Perkins?

58
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,804
Your father doesn't approve
of my drama club.

59
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,973
Daddy, why don't you
want mama to be
an actress again?

60
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,110
Because limelight
is not becoming to a woman
of your mother's years.

61
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:29,781
Oh, you rat!
Oh, boo!

62
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,052
Oh, yes, you save
the whirlwind life
of glamour for yourself.

63
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,521
Book signings and
parties and the like,

64
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,157
while we languish here
in the wilderness.

65
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,625
Do we live
in the wilderness?
How thrilling!

66
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,227
We should get knives!

67
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,596
Yes, we should!
Guess who will be
the head pirate?

68
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,035
<i> Cecil, did you ever</i>
<i> pick up a girl before?</i>

69
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,170
<i>- Did you?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

70
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,506
<i> Oh, goodness.</i>

71
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,075
<i> You're the funniest person</i>
<i> I've ever seen.</i>

72
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,077
<i> Hold it.</i>
<i> What's the matter, Cecil?</i>

73
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,479
<i> I don't know.</i>

74
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,613
<i> What's that, Cecil?</i>

75
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,883
Don't wait up.
Ten.

76
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,551
Eleven.
Ten.

77
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,153
Swine.

78
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,892
<i> He had</i>
<i> listened attentively</i>
<i> to a sermon in chapel</i>

79
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:17,162
<i> by a sophomore</i>
<i> with false whiskers.</i>

80
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,898
<i> He had prepared studiously</i>
<i> for an examination</i>

81
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,100
<i> on the contents</i>
<i> of the college catalog.</i>

82
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,168
Ten.

83
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,678
That's
a very long paragraph.

84
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,280
It started
four pages ago.

85
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,781
Poor Maxwell.

86
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,253
You're too
young to be in love.

87
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,954
How old
do you have to be?

88
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,257
Forty.

89
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,227
<i> Or, I should say,</i>

90
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:53,832
<i> he was like a man</i>
<i> who stands upon a hill</i>
<i> above the town he has left,</i>

91
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:58,003
<i> yet does not say</i>
<i> "the town is near"</i>

92
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:02,040
<i> but turns his eyes</i>
<i> upon the distant</i>
<i> soaring ranges.</i>

93
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,209
<i> The end.</i>

94
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,573
Mighty books.

95
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,743
Mighty books.

96
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,680
May I help you?
God damn.

97
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,615
Look at all these books.

98
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,585
Do you ever stop to consider
the pure man-sweat

99
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,887
that went into
each and every line?

100
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,691
Little testaments of faith,
screamed out in
the dark night,

101
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:56,127
in the cold, dark night
when the wind's
blowing alpine,

102
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,131
in the vain hope
that someone will read
and hear and understand.

103
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,800
You must be Thomas wolfe.

104
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,101
Are all these your authors?

105
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,003
Not tolstoy.

106
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,610
Mr. Perkins.

107
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,947
Please, sit down.

108
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,750
I wasn't even gonna come.

109
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,853
Prefer to get my
rejections in the mail.

110
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,724
There's something
surgically antiseptic
about those familiar words,

111
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,726
"we regret to inform you..."

112
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,128
But I wanted to meet you.

113
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,398
The man who first read
Mr. f. Scott Fitzgerald
and said,

114
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,334
"yes! The world needs poets.

115
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,638
"My god!
Someone publish
this bastard,

116
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,206
"'cause the world
needs poets.

117
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,408
"Or why even live?"

118
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,176
So I'm looking
at that man now.

119
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:47,979
Well, congratulations.

120
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,150
On finding one genius.
Two, if you count Hemingway.

121
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,085
As for this one,

122
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,821
he'll persevere.

123
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,425
You can't kill the deep roots
by cutting off
a few top branches.

124
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,827
And the roots go deep,
Mr. Perkins.

125
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,930
And they are unassailable.

126
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,803
Mr. wolfe,
we intend to
publish your book.

127
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,076
If that's acceptable
to you.

128
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,746
Now, I'd like to do
some work with you.

129
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:25,016
In its current state,
<i> o lost</i> is simply too long
for one volume.

130
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,452
I think you could afford
to shape it a bit,

131
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,354
cut off a few of
the "top branches".

132
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,355
Mr. Perkins.

133
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,859
I know you're not
fooling with me.
You don't look the type.

134
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,328
But my god,
this is too much for me.

135
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,298
You don't know.
You don't know.
You don't know.

136
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,234
Every son-of-a-bitch
publisher in New York
hates my book.

137
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,302
Mr. wolfe,
if you could sit down.

138
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,470
Tom.
Tom.

139
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,271
Tom, please.

140
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,741
Tom.

141
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,843
I take it your book
is autobiographical
in nature.

142
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,445
No other way to write,
is there?

143
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,381
Eugene gant is me!

144
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,750
And my mama is Eliza,
and my papa is w.O. Gant.

145
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,351
We'll get into all that.

146
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,188
I know it's too long.
I know it's too long.

147
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,157
My lord, you don't
know how I struggled
to cut the gorgon down.

148
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,193
You don't know how
i fought with her.

149
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,729
But I'll cut
anything you say.

150
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,030
You just give me
the word.

151
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,466
Tom,

152
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,237
the book belongs to you.

153
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,438
All I want to do
is to bring your
work to the public

154
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,207
in its best possible form.

155
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,844
My job, my only job,

156
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,412
is to put good books
into the hands of readers.

157
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,484
Thank you, Mr. Perkins.

158
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:36,421
Now, scribner's has agreed
to give you our standard
advance against royalties.

159
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,028
If this is satisfactory,
we can proceed at whatever
pace is comfortable for you.

160
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,434
$500?

161
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,906
No one ever
thought my writing
was worth a dime.

162
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,080
Oh, lord!

163
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,183
Do you mind if
we start tomorrow?

164
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,452
Of course.

165
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,823
I promise to work hard.

166
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,142
Yeah!

167
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,214
Oh, lord!

168
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,325
I can barely...

169
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,127
Oh, mighty. Oh, indeedy.

170
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,406
"Mr. wolfe,
we intend to
publish your book."

171
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,074
No!

172
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,214
Tom!

173
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,091
Oh, my angel, thank you.
Thank you.

174
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,227
Thank you,
my lover, my love.

175
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,438
I'm so...

176
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,274
I'm so happy
for you. Oh!

177
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,016
How much you figure
we have to cut?

178
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:49,020
I'm guessing
around 300 pages.

179
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,421
It's not the page count
that's important,

180
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,656
it's telling the story.

181
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,360
There it is.
Four years of my life.

182
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,401
My heart bleeds
to see any of it go.

183
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,437
But I guess it's die dog
or eat the hatchet.

184
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,508
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

185
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,561
The last few weeks
working on the book

186
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,398
have been the most
thunderingly thrilling

187
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
of my entire woebegone life.

188
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,235
Glad I could amuse you.

189
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,040
You spend your lifetime
in the pages of books,

190
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,142
as we do,

191
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,511
and those characters emerge
that speak to you deep,

192
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,378
to the marrow.

193
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,281
They are your mirrors.

194
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,482
In my time,

195
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,719
I aspired to Sydney carton.

196
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,554
Or Pierre

197
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,957
from the tolstoy.

198
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,993
But I know
that's not who I am,
much as I would have it so.

199
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,663
We are not those characters
we want to be.

200
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,565
We're those characters
we are.

201
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,335
I'm caliban.

202
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,441
That island creature,

203
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,246
monstrous and deformed.
Caliban.

204
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,550
So ugly.

205
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,151
So alien.

206
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,191
Hurt and shunned
into poetry.

207
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:40,098
What is Manhattan
but an isle full of noises?

208
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,403
"Sounds, and sweet airs
that give delight
and hurt not?"

209
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,273
"Sometimes a thousand
twangling instruments

210
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,009
"will hum about mine ears,

211
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,312
"and sometimes voices

212
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,050
"that, if I then had
waked after long sleep

213
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,685
"will make me sleep again."

214
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,132
I have a thought
about the book, <i> o lost.</i>

215
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:15,366
I think we should
discuss the title.

216
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,173
I don't know that
it truly captures
the meat of your book.

217
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,643
Here, imagine
you're a reader.

218
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:29,347
You're wandering
through a bookstore
and lots of books

219
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,817
and you see a book titled
<i> trimalchio in west egg</i>

220
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,655
and you see one
titled <i> the great gatsby.</i>

221
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,424
Which are you
going to pick up?

222
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,391
<i> Gatsby.</i>

223
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,363
That's why Scott changed
his original title.

224
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,364
He knew it needed
a bit more meat.

225
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,237
It's your book,
just give it a think.

226
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,608
Here we are.

227
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,709
My god, Max!

228
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,179
It's a mansion.

229
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,850
<i> It is so nice</i>
<i> to finally meet you,</i>
<i> Mr. wolfe.</i>

230
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,585
Max has told us so much.

231
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,088
Tom! It's tom.
Please.

232
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,856
And nice to meet you.
Every man Jack of you.

233
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,160
Or "girl Jack,"
i should say.

234
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,464
Max has been circumspect
about all these
beautiful daughters.

235
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:23,167
A bounteous sea
of loveliness.

236
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,570
Max tells us
you're working
on a new book.

237
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,538
I'm nothing if not
a big old octopus.

238
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:27,538
An octopus.

239
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,344
One arm still
wrapped around <i> o lost,</i>

240
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,280
while another one
sneaks over here
through the briny deep

241
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,316
to write the new book.

242
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,518
I guess you could say
I'm... I'm tentacular.

243
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,254
What's the new one about?

244
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,656
It's about America.

245
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,862
All of it.
I'm trying to
capture everything.

246
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,397
Every city and village

247
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,734
and stone and leaf
and man and child.

248
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:00,438
And every farm and flower,
every river.

249
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,207
It's about
the one acetylene torch,

250
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,211
white, bright truth
that burns in the heart
of every man in this country.

251
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,914
And that is the search
for a true father.

252
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,152
I don't mean
biological father.

253
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,553
I'm not talking
about sperm.

254
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,791
I mean, I search for the need
of a father of our spirit.

255
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,227
It's about every single thing
that makes this country great.

256
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,529
It's mammoth!

257
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,167
Max says

258
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,469
the only ideas
worth writing about
are the big ideas.

259
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,871
Big ideas,
fewer words.

260
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,706
You see,
I'm lost without him.

261
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,942
Aren't we all?
You know I'm a writer, too?

262
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,211
That so?

263
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,213
Max didn't tell you?
Mmm.

264
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:45,483
I've been working on a play
for quite some time now.

265
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,219
It's about pauline,
Napoleon's sister.

266
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,688
Historical pageant,
is it?

267
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,691
Well, it's attempting
to be more modern.

268
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,662
I wrote a play once.
It was not a happy experience,
i can tell you that.

269
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,865
I found it
an anemic form,

270
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,668
lacking the multi-colored
cloak of prose.

271
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,771
So I dumped the form
and returned to my novels.

272
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,573
Do you have a title
for your new book?

273
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,242
Your daddy and i
have considered a bunch.

274
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:15,446
Right now we're thinking about
<i> of time and the river.</i>

275
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:19,350
"The river" 'cause
that word just reminds
me of my father.

276
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,956
The river running
away from his door
and right back again.

277
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,824
That sounds like
quite a long book.

278
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,532
Don't say that, aline.

279
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,467
I'll see you tomorrow.

280
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,670
Keep yourself ready for me.

281
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,441
Goodnight. Goodnight.

282
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,477
This should
do you nicely.

283
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,314
I'll see you
in the morning.

284
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,317
Max.

285
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,922
Thank you
for tonight.

286
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,593
I hope I didn't
offend anyone.

287
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,695
I so want your family
to like me.

288
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,763
Don't worry.
Of course not.

289
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,465
I'm not a circus animal.

290
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,702
See, I know I seem
like a freak.

291
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,504
Too loud,

292
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,774
too grandiose,
not quite real.

293
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,478
That's who I am.

294
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,780
That's how I got
out of asheville,
by making noise.

295
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,415
I thrashed my way out.

296
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,053
But I feel things
like a real person.

297
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:30,988
So...

298
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,696
...from caliban's heart,
i say this.

299
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:42,667
In all my life,
well, till I met you,
i never had a friend.

300
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,540
If we nail down
Ben's death today,

301
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,875
then, hell,
we're within hollering
distance of the end.

302
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,111
Aline!

303
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,481
Max.

304
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:34,518
Let me introduce you.
This is Mrs. Bernstein.

305
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,886
How do you do?

306
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,122
Mr. Perkins.

307
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,758
Tom has told me
so much about you.

308
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,894
She's the first person
who told me my writing
was worth anything.

309
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,597
Hell, she's the whole
reason for our book.

310
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,466
I thank you for that.

311
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,700
We were expected
last night.

312
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,968
Oh, I told you...

313
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,603
It was embarrassing
for me.

314
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:53,838
You know I hate
those theatrical affairs.

315
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,072
And you know
i didn't want
to go alone.

316
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,907
If you'll excuse me.

317
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,110
All those actors
make me feel awkward.
You know that!

318
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,778
I told you i
wasn't gonna come.

319
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,914
We will
continue this alone.

320
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,417
I'll come by
around 2:00.

321
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,085
2:00. Perfect. Thanks.

322
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,854
Come on.

323
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,123
Good day,
Mr. Perkins.

324
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,691
You are so mad at me.

325
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:14,959
No, I'm not.
I'm not mad at you.

326
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,403
There it is.
Hmm.

327
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,942
This is our last chance
before we go to the printer.

328
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,945
So I'll ask you again.

329
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,847
Have you thought
about another title?

330
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,116
You'll hate it.

331
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,084
Try me.

332
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,956
Now, I'm
a scribner's bestseller,

333
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,226
I figured I deserve
a little of the high life.

334
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:23,928
Say it again, Max.

335
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,763
Fifteen thousand
copies this month.
Oh.

336
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,201
Aline,
you hear that?
Mmm-hmm.

337
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:32,903
Not even the economy
of the entire country

338
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:36,006
crumbling around our ankles
is hurting my book.

339
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,943
Have you read
tom's book,
Mrs. Bernstein?

340
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:42,079
Yes, Mrs. Perkins,
it's dedicated to me.

341
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:45,182
I wouldn't have
been able to do it
without my sweet jewess.

342
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,585
She bought the paper
and the pencils.

343
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,487
- And paid for the typist.
- That's enough.

344
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,754
That's enough.
She put a roof
over my head

345
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,556
and food in my
prodigious belly.

346
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:53,924
Hell, y'all know how
much I love to eat.

347
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,926
You must be very
proud of the book,

348
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,095
to see all your
faith rewarded.

349
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,130
Our faith.

350
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,900
It's our faith now,
isn't it, Mr. Perkins?

351
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,034
Tom couldn't have
done it without you.

352
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,704
That's not true.

353
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,973
You needn't play
at humble pie with me.

354
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,775
Tom speaks of
your contribution
with such passion.

355
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,946
He really can't seem
to stop talking about you.

356
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,649
"Max says this.
Max says that."

357
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,718
Easy, girl.
Easy, girl.
"Max, Max, Max."

358
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,587
No, we should
give Mr. Perkins
all of the credit.

359
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,690
I mean, after all, he is
the genius who made all
of your dreams come true.

360
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,159
He's the one who shaped
that massive collection
of words into a...

361
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:33,163
Into a marketable
bestseller,

362
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,133
putting it into
the eager hands
of readers everywhere.

363
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,236
I mean, that is
quite a triumph
for Mr. Perkins, hmm?

364
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:46,076
The work is tom's.
He deserves to enjoy it.

365
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,311
Really?
Is that what
tom deserves?

366
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:48,913
Leave Max alone.

367
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,582
I'm not speaking to you,
I'm speaking to your elder.

368
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:54,218
You should learn
to trust your elders.
They know what's best.

369
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,554
They should also
behave in a manner
appropriate to their years.

370
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,558
You're Thomas wolfe?

371
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm reading your book.
It's a masterpiece.

372
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,161
Is it, now?

373
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,297
Very much.

374
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,099
Look, um, I have
some friends who are
dying to meet you.

375
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,735
You don't mind
if I steal him
for a tick or two?

376
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,737
Of course you don't.
Oh, not at all.

377
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,306
After you.
Okay. I'm Willow.

378
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,273
Nice to meet you.
What a pleasure.

379
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,979
Good evening.

380
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,948
This is Thomas wolfe.
No, it's my pleasure.

381
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,115
Good evening.
Nice to meet you.

382
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,644
You don't know what they're
like, the state asylums.

383
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,646
Grotesque.

384
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,084
I don't have the words.
There...

385
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:03,120
There are no words
in my lexicon.

386
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,756
One word, no flourishes.
Grotesque.

387
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,894
The screaming is
constant and so...

388
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,897
Desolate.

389
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,001
They don't have
enough toilets.

390
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,072
I can't let Zelda
stay in such a place.

391
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:22,072
I know.

392
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,711
But private asylums
are expensive

393
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,350
and I know <i> gatsby</i>
didn't make any money.

394
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,689
But I'm up
against it, Max.

395
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,858
Scribner's can't give you
any more advances.

396
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,164
<i> The post</i> won't even take
any more of my stories.

397
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,670
I guess I could go back
to Hollywood and give
that another try.

398
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,772
I hope you don't do that.

399
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:55,873
Why?
You're a novelist.

400
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:58,976
Not anymore.

401
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,114
I should have died
when I was 24.

402
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,885
Right after
<i> this side of paradise.</i>

403
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,289
Did you get that
book I sent you?

404
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,958
Which?

405
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,461
General Grant's memoirs.

406
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,396
Do you know how he
came to write them?

407
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,400
This is interesting.

408
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,105
He was dying
of throat cancer

409
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:33,377
and he wanted to leave
something behind
for his family,

410
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,979
so he started writing
his autobiography.

411
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,384
He worked every day
for hours and hours.

412
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,455
He was in great pain,
anguish,

413
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,990
but he just
kept on writing.

414
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,729
And in the end, he produced
the most astounding book.

415
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,299
So very beautiful.

416
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,905
Just a little velvet
to see you through.

417
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,784
I'll write you
a great book.

418
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,019
I know.

419
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,898
Mrs. Perkins.

420
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,367
Mrs. Bernstein.

421
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,138
Hello.

422
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,473
You're designing
this production?

423
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,008
Yes.

424
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,544
Me and all the lost boys.

425
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,447
We know a few of them,
don't we?

426
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:25,155
You didn't know him
when he was young.
He was fresh out of Harvard

427
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,926
and he was all ready
to carve up the world.

428
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,128
He was unlike anyone
I'd ever met.

429
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,962
I understand.

430
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,099
I don't think
that you do.

431
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:39,269
You see, my husband
is a very kind man, but
he's a man without color.

432
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,308
He's a man
of wall street
and numbers.

433
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,311
I don't
understand numbers.

434
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,346
You have children,
Mrs. Bernstein?

435
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,314
Yes.

436
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,083
A daughter and a son.

437
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,986
They're grown.

438
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,024
I did a foolish thing
when I fell in love
with tom,

439
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,359
but I can't help
how I feel.

440
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,062
My heart was touched.

441
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,432
At the very time
in my life

442
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,267
when everything beautiful
was falling away

443
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,270
and no one needed me,
i met tom.

444
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,173
And tom made me
feel beautiful again.

445
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,613
But I know now
I've lost him
to your husband.

446
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,551
Mrs. Bernstein.

447
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:36,260
My husband always
wanted a son

448
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,529
more than anything
in the world.

449
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,966
We reached a point
when we realized that
wasn't going to happen.

450
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,034
And then he met tom.

451
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,305
I can't let him go.

452
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,240
Aline, go home
to your family.

453
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,979
They need you.
Tom doesn't.

454
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,383
Family,
husband,
dignity.

455
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,320
I gave that
all up for him.

456
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,363
Tom.

457
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,332
Come in.

458
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,069
Tom?

459
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,271
I have it.

460
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,439
You have it?

461
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,474
The new book.

462
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,211
With you?

463
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,247
Yes.

464
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,684
Well, let's have it.

465
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,387
Bring it in, guys.

466
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,024
Put it down there.

467
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,231
This is
<i> of time and the river?</i>

468
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,239
Here you go.
Thank you, sir.

469
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,657
Well done.

470
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,497
Now, go home
and get some sleep.

471
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,099
I need you...
Let me read it.

472
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,569
Read it kindly.
Please?

473
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:08,078
If we work every day
in the evening,
when we won't be disturbed,

474
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,547
we can do it.

475
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,251
How long?
Nine months.

476
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,720
If you work hard and
if you resist the temptation
to add much more.

477
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,689
I have to be able
to add more.

478
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,493
Tom, the book
is 5,000 pages long.

479
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:24,795
Point taken.

480
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,501
Now, to begin,
on page one.

481
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,438
Oh, lord. Page one?

482
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,474
Now, look here,
you've given 80
pages to Eugene

483
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,243
on the platform
before the train arrives.

484
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:44,281
That is, perhaps,
gilding the Lily a bit
as to suspense?

485
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,315
I mean, I'll only wait
so long for a train.

486
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,720
Those three sections
to me...
Here you are, Mr. Perkins.

487
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:58,328
When he meets the girl,
you've written this.

488
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,831
"As Eugene's eyes
became accustomed
to the haze

489
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:04,267
"of the cigarettes
and cigars swirling
miasma-like,

490
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,370
"he saw a woman,
in serge

491
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,207
"and gloves that crept
like living tendrils

492
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,609
"up her normally
ivory arms,

493
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,645
"but now sun-kissed
as a blush

494
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:19,149
"as the incarnadine discovery
inside a conch shell

495
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:21,718
"seen for the first time
by a bewildered zoologist

496
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,489
"as he is undone
by its rosy,
promising pinkness.

497
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,592
"Those were her arms.

498
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,429
"But it was her eyes
that stopped his breath

499
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,598
"and made his heart
leap up.

500
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,300
"Blue they were.

501
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,836
"Even through
the swirling vapors
of pompous chesterfields

502
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,671
"and arrogant
lucky strikes,

503
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:45,675
"he saw her eyes
were a blue beyond blue,
like the ocean.

504
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,745
"Blue beyond blue.

505
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,383
"A blue he could
swim into forever

506
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,386
"and never miss
a fire-engine red
or a cornstalk yellow.

507
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,623
"Across the chasm
of that room,

508
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,193
"that blue, those eyes

509
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:06,463
"devoured him
and looked past him
and never saw him

510
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:09,499
"and never would,
of that he was sure.

511
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,670
"From that moment,

512
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:18,475
"Eugene understood what
the poets had been writing
about these many years.

513
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:21,845
"All the lost, wandering,
lonely souls who were
now his brothers.

514
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,882
"He knew a love that
would never be his.

515
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,219
"So quickly did
he fall for her

516
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,721
"that no one in the room
even heard the sound.

517
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,724
"The whoosh as he fell,

518
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,760
"the clatter of
his broken heart.

519
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:41,231
"It was a sure silence

520
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,866
"but his life was shattered."

521
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,303
End of chapter.

522
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,745
You don't like it?

523
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,747
You know I do.

524
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,584
That's not the point.

525
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,791
So he sees a girl
and he falls in love
for the first time, yes?

526
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,960
Does his mind go
to deep-sea marine life?

527
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,529
At that moment, yes.

528
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,431
I don't believe it.

529
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,300
I think you fell in love
with the images,
not the girl.

530
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,737
So we cut the zoology
and the cigar brands.

531
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,938
I'll do it.
And the ruminations
on pink?

532
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,307
No. No!

533
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,576
The adjectives are true.
He's a man who
thinks that way.

534
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,246
Pink is never
just pink.

535
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:33,316
It's a thousand other things,
all profoundly
important to him.

536
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,954
All variations
on his psychological state.

537
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:41,858
Every image and the sound
of every word matters.

538
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,926
No, it doesn't.
Nonsense.
They're vital!

539
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,861
You're losing the plot.
Vital!

540
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:46,930
He's falling in love.

541
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,965
What was it like
the first time
you fell in love, tom?

542
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,868
Was it cornstalk yellow
and pompous chesterfields?

543
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,903
It was a lightning bolt.

544
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,872
And that's what
it should be.
A lightning bolt.

545
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,541
Save all the thunder.

546
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,278
I got you.

547
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,046
I got you.

548
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,715
Cut that.

549
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,750
Cut that.

550
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,953
All right.
We cut the textile.

551
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,021
"He saw a woman..."

552
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:14,491
Cut. Cut. Cut.

553
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:17,560
"But it was her eyes
that stopped his
breath in his throat,

554
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,662
"that made his heart
leap up."

555
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:19,963
No, cut the wordsworth.

556
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,532
"It stopped his breath."

557
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,501
"Blue they were..."
Cut the marine life.

558
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,502
"A blue beyond blue,
like the ocean."
Cliche.

559
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,971
"A blue beyond blue
like..."

560
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,440
Like nothing but blue.

561
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,575
"A blue he could
swim into forever
and never miss..."

562
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,777
Mmm, cut this.

563
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,879
Then pick up with...

564
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,515
Had there ever
been such blue? Had there
ever been such eyes?

565
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:39,749
Don't need the rhetorical.

566
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,384
Why?

567
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,052
It's not a lightning bolt,
it's a digression.

568
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,555
"A blue beyond..." No!

569
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,591
Her eyes were blue.

570
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,694
Better.

571
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:51,995
And cut.

572
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,964
He was worthless,
she was everything.

573
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,735
She was a girl
across a room.
That's enough.

574
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:02,672
And so, cut "the lost,
wandering souls..."

575
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,075
Cut.

576
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,711
"So quickly did
he fall for her

577
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,447
"that no one in the room
even heard the sound,

578
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,682
"the whoosh as he fell,
the clatter..."

579
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,818
The whoosh, the clatter.
Is that the point?

580
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,586
Well, what did you hear
when you fell in love?

581
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,988
What did you hear?
Clattering?

582
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,859
The point is it was all
happening inside him.

583
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,995
His life changed,
no one else in the room
noticed anything.

584
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,364
Then make that
the point.

585
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,965
I hate to see
the words go!

586
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,470
Maybe the larger
question is this.

587
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,939
In a book crowded
with great rolling
mountains of prose,

588
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,774
how is this moment
profoundly different?

589
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,911
Because it's simple.
Unadorned.

590
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,713
Like lightning.

591
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,650
Standing out
in the black sky
by its starkness.

592
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:48,585
Exactly.

593
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,056
God damn!

594
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,097
<i> All aboard!</i>

595
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:05,568
<i>Track 12, southwest trunk line</i>
<i> now departing from track 12.</i>

596
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,672
"Eugene saw a woman.

597
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,442
"Her eyes were blue.

598
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,846
"So quickly did
he fall for her

599
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:19,682
"that no one in the room
even heard the sound."

600
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,787
Period.
End of chapter four.

601
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,857
Only 98 more to go!

602
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,859
I love you,
Max Perkins!

603
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,644
...with Francis
and Eugene in Paris.

604
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,979
Exactly!
As if you're skipping
across the Atlantic.

605
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:53,850
"Matching
Eugene's disorientation."

606
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,618
He didn't know
that she would never
see him,

607
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,753
that her love
would never be his.

608
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:57,987
How could he know that?

609
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:58,855
Hold on, he did.
How?

610
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,702
"The subtle
grapy bloom of dusk."

611
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,840
Tom, we discussed
a transition line.
One line to bridge the cut.

612
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:19,909
You've given me
50 new pages
on the doctor.

613
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,011
You've given me his whole
life story and his father's
whole life story.

614
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,948
I like the doctor.
Well, so do I.

615
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,150
I adore the doctor.
But by god, 50 pages?

616
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,629
Some books are
supposed to be long,
you know?

617
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:42,866
Thank Christ
tolstoy never met you.

618
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,101
We'd have that great novel
<i> war and nothing.</i>

619
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,115
<i> To be a novelist,</i>
<i> you have to select.</i>

620
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,250
<i> You have to</i>
<i> shape and sculpt.</i>

621
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:02,585
Why?

622
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:04,988
Because we've been working
for two years and the book's
only 100 pages shorter.

623
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,691
Five goddamn seconds
of peace is all I ask!

624
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,126
Can't you give me
five goddamn seconds?

625
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,295
God damn!

626
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:15,598
It's the tip of the iceberg,
tom. You're giving me
the full iceberg.

627
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,636
So you're saying
this is trash,
this is trash...

628
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,274
You knew this
was gonna happen.

629
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:28,578
Why are you playing
all dewy-eyed ingenue?

630
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,548
Because I did not imagine,
even taking you at
your absolute worst,

631
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,917
you could be so selfish.

632
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,685
I can't turn my
back on the work.

633
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,186
Aline!

634
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,821
It's what I do.
It's my job.

635
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:40,990
And this is my job.

636
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,660
When will you ever learn
how much an opening
night means to me?

637
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:43,660
Is this all right?

638
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,229
Yes, you look lovely.

639
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:50,567
Could you please put
the scarf on your downstage
shoulder when you enter?

640
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,001
Thank you.

641
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:55,238
It's an important
night for me.
I need you here.

642
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,308
I have to work tonight.

643
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,145
You've been working
every single night
for the past two years.

644
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:03,746
Do you have any
idea what it's like

645
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,281
coming home to
an empty apartment
every night?

646
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:07,717
Look, I'm not saying
your work's not important.

647
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:08,785
Of course you are!

648
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,021
I ask for one night.

649
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:17,093
One night of your precious
time to be at my side
and support me.

650
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,629
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

651
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,332
We are at a moment
of radical crisis
with my book!

652
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,067
Stop it. Stop it!

653
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:24,067
I've never known you
not to be at a point

654
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:28,638
of radical crisis about
something. You really ought
to be on the stage.

655
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,106
Max says
if we push through...

656
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:34,110
There we go.
"Max says! Max suggests!
Max instructs!"

657
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,012
He can have you
every other day of the week

658
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:38,381
but I need you tonight.

659
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:41,784
So, please,
would you get off
my set, go home

660
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,120
and put on your blue suit
and I will pick
you up at 7:00.

661
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,622
I won't be there.

662
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,930
Make your choice, tom.

663
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,001
Right now.

664
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,172
There's no call
for this, honey.

665
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,276
Right now.

666
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,889
Look what you
have done to me.

667
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:46,315
He's under
a lot of pressure.

668
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:49,919
If we don't keep
going now, I don't know
what'll happen to him.

669
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:50,953
You want
the big hamper?

670
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:51,921
And the thermoses.

671
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,292
Thanks.

672
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,995
You have to think
what it's like for him.

673
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:02,098
His first book comes out,
everyone calls him a genius.

674
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,901
Expectations on
the second book
are mighty big.

675
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,136
He's scared.
That's why he
won't stop writing.

676
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,005
Why don't you explain that
to your daughters?

677
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,239
Louise.
They want
their father back.

678
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,742
It's my job,
it's what I do.

679
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:14,444
Every minute
of every day?

680
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:17,246
And if it takes years,
it takes years.

681
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:18,815
You're never
going to get
this time back.

682
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:21,084
It's one damn vacation,
for Christ's sake!

683
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,891
Louise, a writer like tom,
i get one in a lifetime.

684
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,730
You get your daughters
for the same lifetime.

685
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,434
I'm sorry.

686
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,474
Wave to the girls.

687
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,411
All right, ladies!

688
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,279
Are you ready for
our great adventure?

689
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,083
Close your door, darling.

690
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,037
You gotta
stop worrying about
Louise so much,

691
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,405
they'll be back
before you know it.

692
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:17,540
Tom,
where are we going?

693
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,244
Ah, you'll see.

694
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,045
We're supposed
to be working.

695
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,150
This is work.

696
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:31,053
I decided you can
never appreciate
the music of my book,

697
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:33,956
the tonality
and Cadence,

698
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,994
without experiencing
the dark rhythms

699
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,862
that inspire me.

700
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,863
Bourbon!
In a big ol' tumbler.
You?

701
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,932
Martini, please.
Very dry.

702
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:17,233
He'll have a bourbon.

703
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:18,367
You got it.

704
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,107
You hear it, Max?

705
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:27,143
I don't care much
for music.

706
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:34,383
There's a savage indictment
of your grim, puritan soul.

707
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,021
Come on!

708
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,256
There must be
one song you like.

709
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,394
<i> Flow gently, sweet afton.</i>

710
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,567
I'm partial to
<i> flow gently, sweet afton.</i>

711
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,018
You got it, sir.

712
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,457
Two bourbons,
gentlemen.

713
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:21,898
The whole thing about jazz
is that these fellas
are artists.

714
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,571
They interpret the song,

715
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:32,408
letting the music
pour on out,
riff upon riff,

716
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,910
just like I do
with words.

717
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,381
To hell with
standard forms.

718
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:41,918
To hell with
flaubert and Henry James.

719
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,953
Be original. Hmm?

720
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,555
Blaze new trails.

721
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:49,158
That's the whole
ugly gorilla.

722
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,927
Ugly gorilla.
Of course.

723
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:58,434
There.

724
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,340
That's Henry James
for you.

725
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,377
It's comfortable
and familiar, isn't it?

726
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,062
Uh-oh.

727
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,698
What's that?

728
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:35,037
Sounds like an ugly gorilla
coming our way, don't it?

729
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,411
That's tom wolfe!

730
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,092
Feel it, Max!

731
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,437
I see your feet moving.

732
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,272
I see your knees moving.

733
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,447
Come on, Max!
Feel it!

734
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:23,486
Nice.

735
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,808
You see those two
fine ladies over there?

736
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,146
Subtle.
Max, be subtle.

737
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:50,780
At the bar?
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,619
Let's go over there,
say hello.

739
00:50:56,621 --> 00:51:00,122
Come on!
Let's have some fun.
I can't. I can't.

740
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:02,491
They're working girls, Max.
It doesn't count.

741
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,395
Yes, tom, it does.

742
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,332
Well, you don't mind
if I...
No.

743
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,716
Hell, I never know
when to stop, do I?

744
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,322
- Three bourbons!
- You got it.

745
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,691
One, two, three.

746
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,328
And you, too.

747
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,565
I saw you looking at me.

748
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,604
Don't worry,
i ain't gonna
leave you out.

749
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,746
I'm gonna want
the both of you.
All right?

750
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:58,814
Let's have a drink.

751
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,675
<i> I'll tell you</i>
<i> one thing, my friend.</i>

752
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:29,245
You wouldn't do
this to Hemingway.

753
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:33,716
You wouldn't do this
to Fitzgerald, not to your
two goddamn sacred cows!

754
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:35,818
Every word they write
is golden genius!

755
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,686
Stop it!

756
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,688
I bring you stuff
wrenched right
from my guts

757
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,390
and you tell me
it doesn't fit.

758
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:42,758
That's enough.
Go home.

759
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:44,793
What?

760
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,862
Go home.
Go to sleep.

761
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:49,532
No. No, no.

762
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,934
I'm sorry.

763
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:56,205
Please, don't make me go home.
Let me come home with you.

764
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,207
We... we can still
make the 9:02.

765
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,276
No, I'm exhausted
and you're drunk.

766
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:01,810
We'll pick up
tomorrow.
No.

767
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:02,645
You heard him, tom.

768
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,248
Come home.

769
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,452
I'll pay
for the taxi.

770
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:12,788
What the hell
are you doing here?

771
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,325
I can make you dinner.
I'll pay for that, too.

772
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:20,196
Get out of here.
I'm working.

773
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:23,365
Mr. Perkins has informed
you you're not working
anymore tonight

774
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,934
so come on, come with me.

775
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:26,602
Mrs. Bernstein...

776
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:28,704
- Don't touch me!
- For heaven's sake.

777
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,839
You stay there.
Jesus, aline!

778
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,709
- Come.
- Aline.

779
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:36,879
You don't want
to see me?

780
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:39,848
Fine!

781
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,483
Fine!

782
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,588
You will never
have to see me again.

783
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,555
Aline.

784
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,258
Hmm?
What are you doing?

785
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:51,894
What the hell
are you doing?

786
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,331
- Aline!
- No!

787
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,832
- Stop it.
- No!

788
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,434
- Spit 'em!
- No!

789
00:53:58,436 --> 00:53:59,969
Spit 'em!

790
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:02,905
No.
You spit 'em out.
Spit 'em out.

791
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,873
Spit 'em out!
You spit it out.

792
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,413
Stop now, aline.
My love.

793
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,350
My love, my angel.
Stop now.

794
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:17,886
All right.
All right. All right.

795
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,755
Show me your
strength, darling.

796
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,257
Look at me. Look at me!

797
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,759
Show me your strength.

798
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,395
Hmm? Come on.
Come on.

799
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:30,933
All right. Come on.
Come on. That's it.

800
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,935
All right. All right.

801
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:34,370
Mr. Perkins...

802
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,610
I know things such as this
don't happen here

803
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,946
on the fifth floor.
I apologize.

804
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,349
That's not necessary.
If you'll excuse me.

805
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:48,651
Wait up, wait up.
I'll be right there.

806
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:49,918
No, tom, really!

807
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,621
Just give me
a second.

808
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,524
I'll see you at home.
All right.

809
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:56,592
All right.

810
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,075
You were right,
about the cut.

811
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,977
Sorry about being
such a bear.

812
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,450
Don't you think
you should go
with Mrs. Bernstein?

813
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:24,486
Hell, she was just
being theatrical.

814
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,657
All right,
so we forget
about the cut.

815
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,060
Let's go on
to Eugene
in London.

816
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,498
"He thought of the huge
smoky web of London
with the same joy,

817
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,101
"of the suave
potent ale he could get
in one place there,

818
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,470
"of its squares and
ancient courts..."

819
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,813
Daddy!

820
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:51,880
Daddy!

821
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,089
Hurry up.

822
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:01,557
Hi, daddy.
Hello, duck.

823
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,859
Ooh!

824
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,494
Daddy, I caught
a rainbow trout.
Nine inches!

825
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:07,396
You go help
your sisters.

826
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,737
You would not
believe the amount...

827
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,707
Maxwell, please.

828
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:03,685
Tom.

829
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,022
Tom!

830
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:10,959
It's done.

831
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,496
Done?

832
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:15,664
Stop writing.

833
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,502
Gather all your papers
and bring them in tomorrow.

834
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:21,703
Can you do that?

835
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,106
Can you do that?

836
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:24,973
Yes.

837
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:31,914
We finish editing this month.
We go to press in April.

838
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,684
We publish in October.

839
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:40,088
Look at me and say yes.

840
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,062
Yes.

841
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,208
Hmm. Shoot.
Mmm-hmm.

842
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,916
I think I'll go rambling.

843
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:42,885
Maybe Europe.

844
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:48,056
Don't want to be around
when the reviews come out.

845
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:52,995
What?

846
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,534
There's one paragraph
i have to add to the book.

847
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,269
By god!
I have to add it.

848
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:00,269
If you start
adding paragraphs,
we're sunk.

849
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:04,206
One paragraph will lead
to two and then we'll be
here for another year.

850
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,675
Shall I read it
to you?

851
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,176
It goes
at the very front.

852
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:18,921
"This book is dedicated
to Maxwell evarts Perkins.

853
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,660
"A brave and honest man

854
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,565
"who stuck to
the writer of this book

855
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:33,335
"through times of
bitter hopelessness.

856
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,606
"The author hopes

857
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:41,243
"this book will
prove worthy of him."

858
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,984
I wish you wouldn't.
Oh.

859
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,354
Why?
Editors should be
anonymous.

860
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,924
More than that,

861
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,861
there's always the fear

862
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,163
that I deformed your book.

863
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,234
Who's to say
it wasn't the way
it was meant to be

864
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,970
when you first
brought it in?

865
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,006
<i> War and peace.</i>

866
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,175
Not just <i> war.</i>

867
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:15,644
Max.

868
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,879
That's what we editors
lose sleep over,
you know?

869
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,617
Are we really making
books better?

870
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,891
Or just making
them different?

871
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,178
Morning, Mr. Perkins.

872
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:30,419
Miss wyckoff,
where would we find
Mr. wolfe at the moment?

873
01:01:30,421 --> 01:01:31,153
<i> He's in Paris, sir.</i>

874
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,831
<i> "Magnificent reviews.</i>
<i> Full of praise.</i>

875
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,834
<i> "Congratulations,</i>
<i> you've done it again.</i>
<i> Max."</i>

876
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:54,943
<i> "I can face</i>
<i> blunt fact better than</i>
<i> damnable incertitude.</i>

877
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:58,814
<i> "Give me the damn</i>
<i> straight plain truth</i>
<i> right now, damn you!</i>

878
01:01:58,816 --> 01:01:59,815
<i> "Tom."</i>

879
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,154
<i> "Talked of everywhere</i>
<i> as a truly important book.</i>

880
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:08,457
<i> "All comparisons</i>
<i> with greatest writers.</i>

881
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:09,991
<i> "Even James Joyce."</i>

882
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,132
<i> "Hell, Joyce wishes</i>
<i> he was so good."</i>

883
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,770
<i> "Had to rush out</i>
<i> five editions of the book.</i>

884
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:24,139
<i> "Thirty thousand copies.</i>

885
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:27,008
<i> "Never seen</i>
<i> a book so talked about.</i>

886
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,211
<i> "They're calling</i>
<i> you a genius again,</i>
<i> god help you.</i>

887
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,380
<i> "Come home soon. Max."</i>

888
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,029
Mrs. Bernstein.

889
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,166
Mr. Perkins.

890
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,471
What can I do for you?

891
01:02:56,473 --> 01:03:00,475
It's rather what
can I do for you,
Mr. Perkins.

892
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,312
I couldn't help noticing
tom dedicated his
new book to you.

893
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:07,415
He dedicated his
first book to me,
you will recall.

894
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,451
It was a lovely sentiment

895
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:13,188
but what he was
actually saying was,
"thank you and goodbye."

896
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,124
I had served my purpose.

897
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,328
And now,
you have served yours.

898
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,030
"Thank you and goodbye,
Mr. Perkins."

899
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:24,065
With respect,
Mrs. Bernstein,

900
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:26,835
you haven't
the slightest notion
of my relationship with tom.

901
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:26,835
And in view of that...
He makes you do things

902
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:29,504
you never thought you'd do.
He liberates you.

903
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,044
And just when
you have come
to depend upon that,

904
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:37,379
he will leave you.

905
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,283
And you will never
feel so alive again.

906
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:46,254
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bernstein.
I know this has
been hard on you.

907
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,258
Whatever pain
he's caused you,

908
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,093
I can only hope
he didn't mean it.

909
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:53,495
Can you give me his
address in Europe?

910
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:54,963
He asked me not to.

911
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:56,464
Can you tell me
when he's coming home?

912
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:57,899
I don't think so.

913
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,401
So,

914
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,604
I don't exist anymore.

915
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,912
I've been edited.

916
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,193
I haven't quite decided
who I'm going to shoot yet.

917
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,328
Tom,

918
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:27,562
myself

919
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:31,867
or you.

920
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,003
Have you
a suggestion?

921
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:42,010
Suicide seems
a bit extreme.

922
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,511
And killing tom
won't help much.

923
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:45,413
So I suppose
that leaves me.

924
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,016
I suppose it does.

925
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,327
You're overwriting
the scene, Mrs. Bernstein.

926
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,449
We shall see,
Mr. Perkins.

927
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,931
I am very sorry
for what's going
to happen to you.

928
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,198
Truly, I am.

929
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,235
Enjoy the time with tom
while you have it

930
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:41,970
because after him...

931
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,942
...there is a great hush.

932
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,325
Hey,
good to see you.

933
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,498
Max!

934
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,233
Tom!

935
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,441
Oh!

936
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:21,476
Wonderful
to see you, tom.

937
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,312
But we need to talk.
I have a taxi waiting.

938
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,381
Heck, no!
Taxi can take
my luggage.

939
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:29,718
No taxis or trains
or buses or automation.

940
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,486
I have to ambulate.

941
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:34,155
I have to feel
my country again.

942
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,657
You go ahead.
Thank you, sir.

943
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,026
You don't know how
much I missed you.

944
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:40,662
Oh, I missed you too, tom,
but this is important.

945
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,164
Aline came to the office
and she has a gun.

946
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,766
An actual gun.

947
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:46,701
Hell with her.

948
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:48,403
I've been away
so long,

949
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:51,706
we have to celebrate
my return to the greatest
of nations

950
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,475
with all things American.

951
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:57,112
I have to eat some wieners
and, and walk the city

952
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:58,680
and drink us
some serious liquor.

953
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,052
I mean,
can one man do it?

954
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:06,121
Write his whole
life story fairly?

955
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:08,323
Honestly? Like proust,

956
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:09,491
without all the upholstery.

957
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:11,693
Well, sure.

958
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:14,295
Now, <i> of time and the river</i>
stopped when I met aline.

959
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,530
I'll have to write
about that next.

960
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,799
She won't like it.
She'll love it!

961
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,768
It'll make her immortal.

962
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,242
Oh, Max,
look at this.

963
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:29,144
What's happening
to our country, Max?

964
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,284
It's so frivolous.
What?

965
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:38,820
What I do.
Writing books.

966
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:41,189
These folks
will never read.

967
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:44,192
Telling my life story
like it's important
to them.

968
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:45,493
These people
are starving.

969
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:52,801
Hey, come with me.

970
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:56,304
Come on.

971
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:08,083
You have got
to be kidding me.

972
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,217
It'll be worth it,
i promise.

973
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,286
Have I ever lied to you?

974
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,229
This would fall under
the general category

975
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,530
of breaking
and entering.

976
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:24,165
Let's have
an adventure.

977
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:35,510
Damn!

978
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,446
I don't believe it.

979
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,715
I don't believe it.

980
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,298
Why on earth
are we here?

981
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,236
This is where I first lived
when I came to New York.

982
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:04,305
This is where I wrote
<i> look homeward, angel.</i>

983
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,682
I would come here
every twilight

984
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:18,653
and look at the city

985
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,924
and dream of what
my life might be,

986
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:24,559
till the stars came out.

987
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,296
The stars in the sky.

988
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,633
The lights
in the buildings.

989
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,404
All those lights.

990
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,380
All the power of life.

991
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,185
You're not
frivolous, tom.

992
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:56,424
I think back in
the caveman days,

993
01:09:56,426 --> 01:10:00,495
our ancestors would
huddle around
the fire at night

994
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:07,302
and wolves would be
howling in the dark,
just beyond the light.

995
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:08,970
And one person
would start talking.

996
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,974
And he would
tell a story,

997
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,978
so we wouldn't be so
scared in the dark.

998
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,733
I guess I'll have
to look at the proofs
when I get back.

999
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:13,268
Is that all right?

1000
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,805
How long?

1001
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,409
Well, if I don't get shot,
a couple of months.

1002
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:24,012
I'm telling you,
Spain is where
the action's going to be.

1003
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:26,981
You've already done
a bullfighting book.

1004
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,450
Nah, it's not
bullfighting this time.

1005
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,486
World's gone
beyond that, I'm afraid.

1006
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,454
It's war that's coming.

1007
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,790
And you need
to be there?

1008
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,026
Well, I need
to be somewhere.

1009
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:40,595
I need to feel the old
<i> lucha por la vida,</i>
you know?

1010
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:44,732
The struggle for life.
What else is there?

1011
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,434
Hoist her up, boys.
We want to take
a photograph.

1012
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:47,468
All right,
you heard him.

1013
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:53,741
So,

1014
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,646
how's the muse
from greater
asheville doing?

1015
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,416
He's writing
a new book,
god help me.

1016
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:03,384
Did you read
<i> of time and the river?</i>

1017
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:06,354
Crap.

1018
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:08,956
The boy has
serious delusions
of importance.

1019
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:10,892
And he's been mouthing off
to the press too much.

1020
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:14,329
Tell him to shut the hell up
and stick to his pencil.

1021
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,764
Well, you know tom,
he's exuberant.

1022
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,766
Bullshit.
He's starting to believe
what they say about him.

1023
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:20,902
Same thing that happened
to Fitzgerald.

1024
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:22,937
Gets to hear
he's the great man
of letters so many times,

1025
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:24,972
he starts to believe it.

1026
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:27,008
Then he's got
to live up to it and
then he stops writing.

1027
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,811
Tom has to write,
it's in his blood.

1028
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:32,547
Well, they said
the same thing about
Scott five years ago.

1029
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:35,383
Most elegant writer
i ever knew.

1030
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:35,383
Now the poor
son of a bitch

1031
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:38,820
can't string
five words together
to save his own life.

1032
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,925
You know tom
will leave you soon.

1033
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,393
I don't think so.

1034
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,097
You don't think
those bastards
at Harper's and MacMillan

1035
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:51,499
aren't pouring poison
in his ear already?

1036
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,769
Tom won't listen.

1037
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,604
You saw the dedication
in <i> time and the river.</i>

1038
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:57,739
Yeah, I did.

1039
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,410
A bit like something
on a tombstone.

1040
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:05,146
Come on,
let's take a photo
with your catch.

1041
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:06,647
I'll get him mounted
and send him to you.

1042
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:20,661
Our daughter's going
gangbusters at vassar,
she, uh...

1043
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:23,097
She seems to have
developed an affection
for drama.

1044
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:24,799
She might even
be an actress.

1045
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,735
She wants to talk
to you about it, Louise.

1046
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,604
Oh, I would love to.

1047
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,641
That must be tom.
I'll get it.

1048
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,679
It's tom, honey.
He's come to see you.

1049
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,452
Come on, Maxwell!
Let me in, now.

1050
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,156
- Tom, easy.
- Where is Scott?

1051
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:49,590
You might have waited
to start drinking.

1052
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,758
I... I have
to see Scott.

1053
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,560
Tom.

1054
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:54,929
Scott. Scott!
Tom! Look at me.

1055
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,931
Zelda's just out
of the hospital
and she's not well,

1056
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,199
so for god's sake,
don't start in.

1057
01:13:58,201 --> 01:14:00,568
Listen to you.
I'm not some
rude mechanical.

1058
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,939
Scott!
You old bastard.
Tom!

1059
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,608
I tried to tell that
to Max. I mean...

1060
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,977
Tell me, Scott.
Does...

1061
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,814
Does he...
Does he make you
take a lot out?

1062
01:14:12,816 --> 01:14:13,714
He doesn't make me
do anything.

1063
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:19,687
Well, does he
"advise" you
to take a lot out?

1064
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:22,690
We're different
writers, tom.

1065
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,126
How's that?

1066
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:27,795
I don't write
such long books.

1067
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,700
Don't or can't?
Tom!

1068
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:34,202
Just say it,
Scotty.

1069
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:36,838
There's no shame
in writing short,

1070
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,141
though I think
you've taken it
a bit too far.

1071
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:42,844
I mean, come on.

1072
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:44,612
Are you gonna write
another novel? Hmm?

1073
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,084
Max, I hear you finally
went fishing with Ernest.

1074
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:52,153
Yes, in the wilds
of darkest key west.

1075
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,688
Don't ignore me.
That's enough.

1076
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:57,692
Don't pretend
I'm not here.
Jesus Christ!

1077
01:14:57,694 --> 01:15:01,929
I know goddamn well
you ain't written
a word in years.

1078
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:04,599
Don't blame me
for that.

1079
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:07,168
Come on, get up!
What? What? Why?

1080
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,503
- You're leaving.
- Where are we going?

1081
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:11,205
- Get out.
- Why?

1082
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,607
It's all right,
my sweetheart,
it's all right.

1083
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:14,108
Stay calm.
It's all right.

1084
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,780
You should tell him
to put her away somewhere

1085
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:19,780
and get back to work.

1086
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,852
He... he's probably
past it now.

1087
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,554
Couldn't make
a whole book,

1088
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:29,156
but he's still
got some talent
around the edges.

1089
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,594
Faded grandeur,
i suppose you'd call it.

1090
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:35,062
Or he'd call it.
But that...

1091
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:36,597
Would you shut up?

1092
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,601
It amazes me, still,

1093
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:42,937
after all these years,
how cruel you can be.

1094
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:45,039
I... I'm only
being honest.

1095
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:48,576
Did you ever
once try to imagine
how it is for Scott?

1096
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:50,578
Why...
Why would I?

1097
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,179
How many words
did you write today?

1098
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,617
What?
How many words
did you write today?

1099
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,689
Maybe 5,000.

1100
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:03,157
Scott wrote
maybe 100.

1101
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,860
If today was a good day.
If today was a great day.

1102
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:07,728
And he needs to write
as much as you do.

1103
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,230
He fights
over every word.

1104
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:10,932
Then, he should
fight more.

1105
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:13,334
His wife
is going mad!

1106
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:16,103
Nobody cares about
what he writes or even
remembers him anymore.

1107
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:17,972
Can you imagine
what that's like?

1108
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:20,308
Don't blame me
for his weakness.

1109
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,943
It hurts me to
see you so cruel.

1110
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,713
So I've disappointed you,
yet again.

1111
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:28,115
Yes, very much.

1112
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:30,585
Well, I'm sorry
I'm not decent enough

1113
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:33,254
for your fine dinner parties
and your fine friends.

1114
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:36,257
But before
you drag me out
to the woodshed,

1115
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:38,359
I think you ought to look
at who's giving the lesson.

1116
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:40,628
Am I supposed to
grow up like you?

1117
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,597
No, tom, but you're
supposed to grow up.

1118
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,632
How dare you?

1119
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,704
You, of all people.
You, of all goddamn people!

1120
01:16:49,706 --> 01:16:51,772
You're nothing
but a coward!

1121
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,908
Stuck in that
sterile little office.

1122
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,744
Every beautiful thing
in you stunted.

1123
01:16:56,746 --> 01:17:01,115
You don't have
the first idea
what it is to be alive!

1124
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,917
You don't know
what it is to wake up

1125
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:06,120
and grab hold
of life every day
and fight with it.

1126
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,689
You're just so
goddamn scared to live.

1127
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:10,291
There are other
ways to live!

1128
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:14,161
There's loving your children
and seeing them grow up right.

1129
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:18,099
There's providing
for your family.

1130
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:21,002
There's doing work
that's important and
giving to other people.

1131
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:23,070
That's enough.
No, I've taken
your abuse

1132
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:25,873
'cause I told
myself you were worth it.
That the work was worth it.

1133
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,875
But god help anyone
who loves you, tom.

1134
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:29,710
Because for all
your talk

1135
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:31,679
and all your millions
of beautiful words,

1136
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:35,383
you haven't the slightest
idea of what it means
to be alive.

1137
01:17:35,385 --> 01:17:37,718
To look into
another person's eyes
and ache for him.

1138
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,990
I hope someday
you will.

1139
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:46,327
And then maybe
all your words will be
worth five of Scott's.

1140
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,449
<i> Max thinks</i>
<i> he created me.</i>
<i> You know that?</i>

1141
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,818
<i> Like</i> pygmalion.

1142
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:14,855
<i> He thinks... he thinks</i>
<i> he found this ugly lump</i>
<i> of Carolina Clay</i>

1143
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,091
<i> and molded it into me.</i>

1144
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,728
They say
i don't even write
my own books.

1145
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:22,296
They say I can't
write my own books.

1146
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:24,999
It's all because of Max
and his brilliant editing.

1147
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:26,400
I hear it
everywhere I go.

1148
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,369
Wouldn't I be lost
without Max?

1149
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:31,872
What would I do without
the great Maxwell Perkins?

1150
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:35,843
So he finally
stood up to you.

1151
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:38,946
Good for him.

1152
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:44,485
You wouldn't believe how much
the folks at Harper's offered
me for my new book.

1153
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:47,021
There it is.

1154
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,425
I told them no.

1155
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:52,393
You told them maybe.

1156
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:55,062
You tell everyone maybe.

1157
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,201
And now you're going
to tell them yes.

1158
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:10,111
Hey, I'm thinking
of taking a trip.

1159
01:19:10,113 --> 01:19:13,314
A vacation, like.
Buying an old car
and just driving off.

1160
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:14,915
Maybe see California.

1161
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,252
All those
sun-kissed locales.

1162
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:23,891
Why don't you come?

1163
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,861
I mean it.

1164
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:29,830
Let's hit the road
and have some fun again.

1165
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:31,398
You and me.

1166
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,967
Like it used to be.

1167
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:44,912
No one else in
the world even exists.

1168
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:50,217
Mmm... we're in our
own private cathedral.

1169
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,526
Doesn't that sound like
a momentous journey?

1170
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,930
You need
to spend time alone.

1171
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,303
I'm a writer.

1172
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,239
All I do
is spend time alone.

1173
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:16,510
No, you spend time
with your characters.
You've never been alone.

1174
01:20:16,512 --> 01:20:19,446
First you had your family,
then you had me,
then you had Max.

1175
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:21,482
You need
to spend time alone.

1176
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,886
You need to look
at how you move
through your life.

1177
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,223
You hurt me.

1178
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:34,228
You're going to hurt Max.
You shouldn't hurt
anyone else.

1179
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:41,035
Human beings
aren't fiction.

1180
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:43,437
You have no idea
what I had to go through

1181
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,339
to get to where
i am now.

1182
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:48,976
So I can look at you

1183
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,445
and feel

1184
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,114
nothing.

1185
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,996
You know the way out.

1186
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:42,096
The last time
i saw my father,

1187
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:47,468
I was standing
at a train window,

1188
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,103
when I went north
to college.

1189
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,308
He just got
smaller and smaller

1190
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,611
as we pulled away,

1191
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,350
until I couldn't
see him anymore.

1192
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:14,128
That train
carried me to my life.

1193
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,599
Beyond the hills
and over the rivers.

1194
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:23,470
And always,
the rivers run.

1195
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,581
Sometimes they flow
away from my father

1196
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:37,685
and sometimes they
flow back to his door.

1197
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:46,660
I have to prove
i can do it
by myself.

1198
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,265
Then prove it.

1199
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,093
Scott.

1200
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:56,430
I know it was
a while ago
but I'm sorry.

1201
01:23:56,432 --> 01:23:58,132
I was a damn brute.

1202
01:23:58,134 --> 01:24:00,467
I wouldn't blame you
if you slammed
the door in my face.

1203
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:04,705
You don't know how sorry
i am for talking to you
and Zelda like that.

1204
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:07,708
Please, say
you forgive me.

1205
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,443
Believe it or not,
I've been drunk
myself once or twice.

1206
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:13,680
Thank you.

1207
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:22,222
I'm still a bit
of a washout
as a screenwriter.

1208
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:24,658
I just can't make
the grade as a hack.

1209
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,828
Even that
requires a certain
practiced excellence.

1210
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:32,433
I'm mighty glad
to see you, Scott.

1211
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:34,068
I've been rambling around
for months now.

1212
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:38,072
Haven't had anybody
to talk to about work.

1213
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,175
Ah. Work.

1214
01:24:41,177 --> 01:24:42,810
I mean,
who better to talk to?

1215
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:46,113
The man who created
something immortal.

1216
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:49,183
More and more,
i trouble myself with that.

1217
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,586
"The legacy."

1218
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:56,790
Will anyone care about
Thomas wolfe in
100 years? Ten years?

1219
01:24:56,792 --> 01:25:00,694
When I was young,
i asked myself that
question every day.

1220
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,763
Now, I ask myself,
"can I write one
good sentence?"

1221
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:09,236
How can you say that?
Don't you want
to be remembered?

1222
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:11,171
<i> This side of paradise</i>
was just put out of print,

1223
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:13,207
for the first time
in 18 years.

1224
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:16,643
<i> Gatsby</i> will go next.
That'll never happen.

1225
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,245
You know how much
i made in royalties
on <i> gatsby</i> last year?

1226
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:21,448
Two dollars and 13 cents.

1227
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:23,851
But I don't mind.
I'm working now.

1228
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,392
My next-door neighbor
is a radio actress.

1229
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:35,662
She periodically rehearses
her screams and laughter.

1230
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,832
That's a little
disquieting.

1231
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:41,768
Oh, the laughing's worse.
Trust me.

1232
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:44,204
You spoken to Max lately?
Oh, don't talk about Max.

1233
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,141
Why not, tom?

1234
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:51,545
I know he's your friend,
but you have no idea.

1235
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,281
He crippled me.

1236
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:55,916
He deformed my work.

1237
01:25:55,918 --> 01:25:58,218
He as much admitted it.

1238
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,721
And then he tried
to take all the credit
for my success.

1239
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,723
He did no such thing.
Do you know how
much you hurt him?

1240
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:04,725
We hurt each other.

1241
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:06,193
Don't be glib
with me, tom.

1242
01:26:06,195 --> 01:26:08,362
You don't know
what he did to me.

1243
01:26:08,364 --> 01:26:10,697
What he did to you?
Uh-huh.

1244
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:12,733
What did he do?
He made all your
dreams come true.

1245
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:15,169
He gave you a career.
A life!

1246
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:18,272
There.
The scribner party line.
I expected more from you.

1247
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:21,708
That decent man
believed in you
when nobody else would.

1248
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:24,478
He poured all his hopes
and dreams into you.

1249
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,348
All the things he would
never do, all the books
he would never write.

1250
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,751
And now you repay him
with ugly accusations
and brutality.

1251
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:31,885
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

1252
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,324
That man has a genius
for friendship

1253
01:26:37,326 --> 01:26:40,360
and you've squandered it.

1254
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:43,530
There will come a day
when you're not
the success you are now.

1255
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,934
It's a long road
then, believe me.

1256
01:26:46,936 --> 01:26:49,503
Why hurt the one man
who will walk on
that road with you?

1257
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,321
Daddy?

1258
01:27:07,323 --> 01:27:08,855
Hello, puppet.

1259
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:11,291
Why doesn't tom
come around anymore?

1260
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:16,630
Oh, Nancy.

1261
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,767
Tom needs some
time for himself.

1262
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:22,903
Is he coming back?

1263
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,773
I don't think so.

1264
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:30,577
See, tom's the kind of
fellow who needs to make
his own way through life.

1265
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,246
Is he mad at us?
No, honey.

1266
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:35,382
No, sometimes
people just go away.

1267
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,387
They have to grow up,
leave home.

1268
01:27:40,389 --> 01:27:41,922
It'll happen
to you, too.

1269
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:43,657
Poor daddy.
I miss him, too.

1270
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,798
Tell you what,
get me his book.

1271
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:06,847
"A destiny that leads
the English to the Dutch
is strange enough

1272
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:12,452
"but one that leads from
epsom into Pennsylvania

1273
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,955
"and thence into the hills
that shut in altamont

1274
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:18,458
"over the proud coral cry
of the cock

1275
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,395
"and the soft stone smile
of an angel

1276
01:28:21,397 --> 01:28:25,832
<i> "is touched by that</i>
<i> dark miracle of chance</i>

1277
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:29,369
<i> "which makes new magic</i>

1278
01:28:29,371 --> 01:28:31,772
<i> "Each moment is the fruit</i>

1279
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,843
<i> "The minute-winning days,</i>

1280
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:39,079
<i> "and every moment</i>

1281
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,551

<i> "Why here?</i>

1287
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:58,765
<i> "O lost!"</i>

1288
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:32,766
<i> Mr. Perkins,</i>
<i> you have a call.</i>

1289
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:34,901
From tom's mother.

1290
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,606
Mrs. wolfe?

1291
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:44,111
Who even heard
of such a thing?

1292
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:47,013
Tuberculosis
of the brain.

1293
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:50,050
Doesn't even
seem real.

1294
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:56,022
To be brought low by such
a strange and sudden thing?

1295
01:29:56,024 --> 01:29:57,891
They're doing
everything they can.

1296
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:01,895
Who would credit it?

1297
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,663
Who would credit it, now?

1298
01:30:03,665 --> 01:30:05,432
What's that?

1299
01:30:05,434 --> 01:30:07,667
That he should
end up here,
of all places.

1300
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,440
When tom collapsed
out west,

1301
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:15,142
they brought him back here
for the surgery.

1302
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:18,078
Best place for it, they said.
Right here in Baltimore.

1303
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,151
His father died in
this very hospital,

1304
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,120
just along the hall.

1305
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,158
It's like tom's whole life
is leading him,

1306
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:32,959
like a river,
back to his father.

1307
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,033
<i> The surgeon said</i>
<i> his brain was filled</i>
<i> with tumors.</i>

1308
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:42,536
A myriad of tumors.

1309
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:45,972
That's the word he used,

1310
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,008
"myriad."

1311
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:52,012
I think tom
would like that.

1312
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,949
There's nothing
they can do, you see.

1313
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,051
The doctor said
it was a matter of weeks.

1314
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:02,589
Might regain consciousness,
most likely not.

1315
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:07,594
No, you stay
with Nancy.

1316
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:10,130
You should,
you know, prepare her.

1317
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:15,902
She always
loved tom the most.

1318
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,642
The plural of
"myriad" is "myriads",
by the way.

1319
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:53,840
Mr. wolfe?

1320
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:57,010
Pencil.

1321
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,546
Oh, no, Mr. wolfe,
I'm sorry,
you just lie still.

1322
01:31:59,548 --> 01:32:00,247
I'll get the doctor.

1323
01:32:00,249 --> 01:32:02,649
Pencil.

1324
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:36,202
Afternoon,
Mr. Perkins.

1325
01:34:36,204 --> 01:34:37,671
Afternoon, James.

1326
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:44,871
<i> Dear Max,</i>

1327
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:48,508
<i> I've got a hunch.</i>

1328
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:50,844
<i> And I wanted to write</i>
<i> these words to you.</i>

1329
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:56,182
<i> I've made a long voyage</i>
<i> and been to a strange country</i>

1330
01:35:56,184 --> 01:36:00,286
<i> and I've seen</i>
<i> the dark man very close.</i>

1331
01:36:00,288 --> 01:36:02,288
<i> And I don't think</i>
<i> I was too much</i>
<i> afraid of him.</i>

1332
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,426
<i> But I want most</i>
<i> desperately to live.</i>

1333
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:10,964
<i> I want to see you again.</i>

1334
01:36:10,966 --> 01:36:14,167
<i> For there is such</i>
<i> impossible anguish</i>
<i> and regret</i>

1335
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:16,870
<i> for all I can</i>
<i> never say to you,</i>

1336
01:36:16,872 --> 01:36:18,538
<i> for all the work</i>
<i> I have to do.</i>

1337
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,042
<i> I feel as if a great window</i>
<i> has been opened on life.</i>

1338
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,880
<i> And if I come</i>
<i> through this,</i>

1339
01:36:26,882 --> 01:36:29,115
<i> I hope to god</i>
<i> I am a better man</i>

1340
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,784
<i> and can live up to you.</i>

1341
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,354
<i> But most of all,</i>

1342
01:36:34,356 --> 01:36:37,524
<i> I wanted to tell you,</i>
<i> no matter what happens,</i>

1343
01:36:37,526 --> 01:36:40,126
<i> I shall always feel about you</i>

1344
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,028
<i> the way I did</i>
<i> that November day</i>

1345
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,563
<i> when you met me</i>
<i> at the boat</i>

1346
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:48,201
<i> and we went on top</i>
<i> of the building</i>

1347
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:52,205
<i> and all the strangeness</i>
<i> and the glory and the power</i>
<i> of life were below.</i>

1348
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:55,341
<i> Yours always,</i>

1349
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:57,410
<i> tom.</i>
