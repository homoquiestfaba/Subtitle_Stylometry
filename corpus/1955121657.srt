<b>WHO'S DRIVING DOUG</b>

2
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:20,739
Can you turn
that down a little?

3
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:37,256
"Why were you
afraid, Lily?" said Jim.

4
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:38,657
"I was afraid that
you would reject me

5
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:42,194
"like all the others
do," said Lily.

6
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,230
Then Lily and Jim hug each other

7
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,900
and never let go.

8
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,435
The end.

9
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,209
Good.

10
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,477
That was good.

11
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,778
Comments.

12
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,615
I really felt the bond
between Lily and Jim.

13
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,217
It was very real.

14
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:06,918
Thank you.

15
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:07,954
Good.

16
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:09,187
Anyone else?

17
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,324
Basically, the whole story's
about society's expectations

18
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,360
on love and how we
deal with it and...

19
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,294
Basically, that's it.

20
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,264
That's what I was going for.

21
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:21,366
Yeah, good, good.

22
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,269
What about you, Doug?

23
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,542
God, that fucking sucked.

24
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:31,743
The story couldn't
have been any more

25
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:35,614
contrived and just phony.

26
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:40,318
And what do you know about
love, you pretentious moron?

27
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:44,991
Do all your experiences
come from watching sitcoms?

28
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,794
God, it just makes me
wanna, like, ralph!

29
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,401
Doug!
Doug! Doug! Doug!

30
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,271
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!

31
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,241
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
Doug.

32
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,309
Doug?

33
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:07,614
Everything was said.

34
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:10,949
Good.

35
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,885
Now, on that note,

36
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,923
I have a special treat
for you folks today:

37
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,958
The final assignment.

38
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,360
We'll pass it around now.

39
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:24,429
Read it, and I'll answer
questions next class.

40
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:49,055
I just have
a lot of papers to grade.

41
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,457
I just want to see you more.

42
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,427
When will I see you, then?

43
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,495
Maybe this weekend.

44
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,430
Okay.

45
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,698
Okay. I'll call you, but...

46
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,764
I have to go, okay?

47
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:00,699
Okay.

48
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,641
Hey! Stephanie!

49
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,877
Hey, Steph.

50
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,346
Hi, Doug.

51
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,014
Hey, how's your...

52
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,357
What's up?

53
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,490
Thank you.

54
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,625
My fiction seminar
was cancelled.

55
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,428
That's too bad.

56
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:30,995
Hey, I gotta get to class.

57
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,130
I'll roll with you.

58
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:33,699
Okay. Cool.

59
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:41,740
So I just
want to let you know

60
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,643
that Wednesday is
gonna be my last day.

61
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:46,545
Wait, you're quitting?

62
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:48,113
Yeah, sorry about that.

63
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,849
My boyfriend's band got
this gig in San Fran,

64
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,385
and I'm driving up there
with him on Thursday.

65
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:54,753
So, yeah.

66
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:53,712
Doug? Doug.

67
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,014
There you are.

68
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,418
Hi. It's so, God, dark in here.

69
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:02,454
Did Gretchen even
clean your room yet?

70
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:05,490
I don't know.

71
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,625
Don't get me started on her.

72
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:09,429
She is not the brightest
bulb in the box.

73
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,598
How are you, Mom?

74
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,532
Well, I've been
running around all day.

75
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:15,567
I mean, the florist called.

76
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,836
He was running late.

77
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,704
And then Gretchen broke
another one of my plates

78
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,072
and blames it on the dog.

79
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,474
Right?

80
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,543
I love you, too, Mom.

81
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,744
I'm sorry, honey.

82
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,111
I'm just a little frazzled.

83
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:29,481
What's going on with your hair?

84
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,951
It's very dusty in here, okay?

85
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,084
And what's the matter?

86
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,719
You seem... pooped?

87
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,223
Janice quit.

88
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,858
Great.

89
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,025
This is not what
I need right now.

90
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,127
I have to get that.

91
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,530
The painter's
supposed to be coming,

92
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:45,630
and, you know, we're...

93
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,731
Gretchen!

94
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:49,201
Can you please answer the phone?

95
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:02,081
Hey, what's up?

96
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,052
How are you doing?

97
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,893
Okay.

98
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,829
I miss you.

99
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:57,635
Thank you.

100
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:59,103
Slow it down, Turbo.

101
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:00,972
Jackass.

102
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,316
Says here you want to be
a video game programmer?

103
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,284
Yeah.

104
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,191
That's... different.

105
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,066
My brother-in-law went
to the same high school.

106
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,600
All right.

107
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,735
Go, Humpbacks!

108
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,645
So, what have you been
doing in the meantime?

109
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:43,149
I've been pursuing
my associate's degree.

110
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,185
For five years.

111
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:50,722
Listen, I'm gonna be
honest with you...

112
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:52,924
Scott.

113
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,659
Scott.

114
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,630
Your academic record is,

115
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,198
well, it's less than stellar.

116
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,100
What?

117
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,668
What about my SAT scores?

118
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:03,701
Yes.

119
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,204
They're quite good.

120
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,206
But that was high school.

121
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,209
Alright, I admit it, I've
had a rough couple of years.

122
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,879
But I'm ready to
buckle down, you know?

123
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,682
"Seize the moment."

124
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,652
You guys got, like,
financial aid, right?

125
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:23,722
Like... pretty lucrative
for your students?

126
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,158
I really don't think

127
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,192
that this would be the
right school for you,

128
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:31,362
but I can offer
you some brochures

129
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:35,400
to some less
discriminating universities

130
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:39,437
that would be perfectly
suited for someone like you.

131
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,875
You know what?

132
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:45,644
Fuck this.

133
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,768
Hey.

134
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,271
Hey, you're looking for
a new driver, right?

135
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:13,471
Yeah.

136
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,807
You're Doug?

137
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:17,742
I'm Scott.

138
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,310
Scott Lane.

139
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,014
Hi.

140
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:25,783
So how many times a week?

141
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,720
Four times a week.

142
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:31,056
And what, like, nine to...

143
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,792
Who's this?

144
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,427
I'm Scott.

145
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,730
I can start as
early as tomorrow.

146
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:42,901
Well, if your driving
record checks out.

147
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,969
Great. I'll call you.

148
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,772
Sorry.

149
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,977
I don't like him.

150
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,931
Mom!

151
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,805
Sorry I was late, man.

152
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:21,774
Being on time's not...

153
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,043
It's not really my thing.

154
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,148
So, what's your major?

155
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:29,982
Theatre.

156
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:30,883
Cool.

157
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,317
Sounds like fun.

158
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,020
Be the next Judy Garland?

159
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,393
You know, I was in a play once

160
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:45,297
in high school, and they
made us dance the Charleston.

161
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,966
It's like the
stupidest dance ever.

162
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,269
You ever had to
dance the Charleston?

163
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,306
You want the radio on?

164
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:56,841
No.

165
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:07,853
What are you staring at?

166
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,322
I'm thinking.

167
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,924
Watch the road, please.

168
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,159
Damn.

169
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,866
Where are you from?

170
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:22,934
Vegas.

171
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,535
Really?

172
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,904
My dad was gonna take me,

173
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,973
but he didn't get the chance.

174
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,875
Is it cool?

175
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,911
Yeah.

176
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,115
It is.

177
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:52,530
Alright.

178
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:55,099
This is where you get off.

179
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:00,471
You need to unlock me.

180
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,110
Press the right button

181
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:08,247
that's inside the
steering wheel.

182
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:12,116
Left.

183
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:13,852
Right.

184
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:18,990
What'd I just do?

185
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,894
You reset my radio stations.

186
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,328
Are you kidding?

187
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,932
I can't tell if
you're kidding or not.

188
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,101
Well, do you need any
help getting inside?

189
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:30,936
I'm fine.

190
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,905
I got it from here.

191
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,944
Have a good day at
school, sugarplum!

192
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,903
Hey.

193
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,547
Be right there.

194
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,619
I have to be there.

195
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:24,255
I don't care.

196
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,957
I'm coming.

197
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,135
"I fucking trusted you,
and this is how you repay me?

198
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:41,005
"By fucking my
girl?" said Martin.

199
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:44,342
"I'll show you trust,"
replied Michael angrily.

200
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,044
Then Michael picked up a
hammer and beat Martin's skull

201
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:50,115
until it was a bloody
mess on the floor.

202
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,616
Then Jane entered
room topless,

203
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,218
with a towel around her waist.

204
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,519
She looked at the
mangled corpse,

205
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:57,221
then at Michael and said,

206
00:15:57,254 --> 00:16:00,091
"Thank you for
killing that bastard.

207
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,592
"You're a man.

208
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,161
"Let's fuck."

209
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:11,102
I've gotta go to
French class meet-up tonight.

210
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:12,770
If you're not
doing anything after,

211
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:17,009
you wanna practice
some French kissing?

212
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,978
What?

213
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,078
Nevermind.

214
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:24,281
We still on for a study
sesh Saturday night?

215
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,050
Sure.

216
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,185
Doug. Listen, man.

217
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,687
We got a problem.

218
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:32,323
Stephanie, this is Scott.

219
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,524
-Hi.
-Hi.

220
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:34,192
I'm Stephanie.

221
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,460
Look, man.

222
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,230
Something's come up, and
I've gotta go to Vegas.

223
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,697
Is everything okay?

224
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,434
Yeah, it's like
a personal family thing

225
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,202
I gotta take care of.

226
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,737
Yeah, don't worry about it.

227
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,673
I'll find someone to take over.

228
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:52,644
I don't really have a car.

229
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,813
So, remember how
you were saying that

230
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,250
you wanna go to Vegas?

231
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,585
I could drive you there.

232
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:01,653
Show you around.

233
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,422
It'll be such a good time.

234
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,423
I don't know.

235
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,057
Come on, Doug.

236
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,725
You're always
talking about Vegas.

237
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,395
I just met you.

238
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,597
Doug, I know
you don't know me,

239
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:16,535
and I know this is,
like, a huge favor,

240
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:20,571
but please, this would
really help me out.

241
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,406
And I'll go with you.

242
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,241
There's plenty
of room in the van.

243
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:25,744
It'll be a party.

244
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:28,480
I'll have to think about it.

245
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,215
You gotta think about it.

246
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:34,185
He's gotta think about it.

247
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,420
Okay. Think about it.

248
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:37,489
Bye, Stephanie.

249
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,823
Thanks for walking with me.

250
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:40,459
See ya.

251
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,358
Alright, captain.

252
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:43,695
Come on, let's get you home.

253
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:52,237
I don't trust this
Scott character.

254
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,843
I just... I wanna
see Vegas before I die.

255
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,845
Dad would let me go.

256
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,346
Don't be so dramatic.

257
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:03,414
And no, your father would
not allow you to run off

258
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,151
to Las Vegas with
a total stranger!

259
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:09,254
Honey, if you want to
go, we'll set a trip up.

260
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:10,154
Okay?

261
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:11,590
We'll see the Hoover Dam.

262
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,426
I don't want to
go to Vegas with my mom.

263
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,228
I'm not a child.

264
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,431
And you said yourself
I need to get out more.

265
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:21,465
What? This is different.

266
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:23,300
This is not going to the mall.

267
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,270
This is Las Vegas.

268
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,508
I mean, what are you
gonna do there, anyway?

269
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,310
I mean, this place is not
made for someone like you.

270
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,147
Trust me.

271
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:41,219
It's just... It's
not, it's not g...

272
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:45,156
It's, it's settled.

273
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,193
We'll be having
chicken again tonight.

274
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:51,864
I hope that's okay with you.

275
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,903
So the schedule

276
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,570
this year, that's why
so many say yes #9,

277
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,673
yes worthy of being
a top 10 team,

278
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,641
but without a signature
non-conference game

279
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,644
and playing that schedule,
what can we make?

280
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:07,344
Yeah?

281
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:08,480
Yo, Scott.

282
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,214
Hey, Doug.

283
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,182
What's up?

284
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:14,685
Hey, do you still
need a ride to Vegas?

285
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,888
Yeah, yeah, I do.

286
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,423
Great. I'm down.

287
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,226
Thanks, man.

288
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,295
Dude, we're gonna
have so much fun.

289
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,663
Like, Stephanie's
gonna be thrilled.

290
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:27,665
I'll see you tomorrow.

291
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,274
Many species of tortoises
are sexually dimorphic,

292
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,276
that the differences
between males and females

293
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:39,644
vary from species to species.

294
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:40,811
Doug?

295
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,881
Do you want to eat
with me tonight?

296
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:45,217
I have plans.

297
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,286
In some species,
males have a longer,

298
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,755
more protruding neck length.

299
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,241
You fucking bastard.

300
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:13,811
You said you wouldn't leave me.

301
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:17,749
You said you would
never leave me.

302
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,321
I should flush you
down the toilet.

303
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,291
That's what I should do.

304
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,727
I should flush you
right down the toilet.

305
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:36,368
Gretchen!

306
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,238
Can you please
come clean this up?

307
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,813
I can't believe
your mom's letting you do this.

308
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:50,714
Yeah.

309
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:51,982
Me neither.

310
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:55,454
So, if you
don't mind me asking...

311
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:59,625
You want to
ask about my disability.

312
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,028
I really don't talk about it.

313
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,696
Are you a virgin?

314
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:08,900
I have osteodystrophy.

315
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:11,670
Actually, I have a rare,

316
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:14,873
non-progressive form of it.

317
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:18,042
So you're saying
you're a virgin.

318
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,711
Non-progressive, so...

319
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:21,945
It doesn't get worse.

320
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,347
Mhmm.

321
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,282
Sounds like you
got lucky, to me.

322
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:28,319
Well, I actually
don't know what it is.

323
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,322
I'm one of the few
people that has it.

324
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,958
It's extremely rare.

325
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,492
Were you born with it?

326
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:37,062
Yup.

327
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:41,333
You know, if you want, you
can ask something about me.

328
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:44,035
Why would I want to
ask something about you?

329
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,202
You're normal.

330
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:49,307
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever said about me.

331
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:56,847
Hey, it's Stephanie.

332
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,950
Just in the van.
So...

333
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,652
What's going on
with your family?

334
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,087
Man, it's not really
a family thing.

335
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,657
It's more of a friend
who's like family.

336
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,526
I don't know, it's complicated.

337
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:10,528
What's up with your family?

338
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,396
What's your dad do?

339
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,399
My dad is dead.

340
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:16,901
Call me back
when you get this, I guess.

341
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,103
I love you.

342
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:19,604
Bye.

343
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,942
What are you guys talking about?

344
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,378
Manly things.

345
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,448
Beards and chainsaws
and penises and such.

346
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,549
Okay, nevermind.

347
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:48,659
Doug.

348
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,462
Doug.

349
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,730
Hey.

350
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,965
Wake up.

351
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,201
I miss the pool.

352
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,170
You can swim?

353
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:00,872
I could float.

354
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,776
I can even walk around
the shallow end a little.

355
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:09,746
Just less gravity
under the water.

356
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,182
You did this as a kid?

357
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:15,118
I used to spend hours
and hours in the pool,

358
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:18,623
until my hands got all
wrinkly.

359
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:23,161
I just felt so free.

360
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:30,901
Hey, you know, the hotel
we're going to will have a pool.

361
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,936
We can... We can go for a swim.

362
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,905
I'll help you out.

363
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,942
I haven't been able to do that

364
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:42,179
for a very long time.

365
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,853
Hey, are you guys hungry?

366
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:50,954
Yeah, I think I could eat.

367
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:52,090
What about you?

368
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,225
Yeah.

369
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:11,142
There you go, hun.

370
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:20,651
Hi, guys.

371
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:22,653
What can I get ya?

372
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:25,523
I'll get the
number three, please.

373
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:28,527
I'll have the
Big Texas burger.

374
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,863
And what can I get for him?

375
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:36,199
I don't know, Ethel.

376
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,002
Why don't you ask him?

377
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,575
Can I get a number
one with extra bacon?

378
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:48,980
Okay, a number one, no bacon.

379
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:54,651
Can I get extra bacon?

380
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:55,653
Right.

381
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:58,622
Number one, no bacon.

382
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:05,830
He wants extra bacon.

383
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,098
And a round of waters, please.

384
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:09,701
Thank you.

385
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,811
Must get annoying?

386
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:24,649
It happens all the time.

387
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:38,997
Well, this burger
tastes like shit.

388
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,170
You alright?

389
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:53,310
Sorry.

390
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,083
Can you... Can you
cut it up for me?

391
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:00,785
Yeah, sure thing, man.

392
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:10,827
Thank you.

393
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,764
No worries.

394
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:19,704
You're a natural.

395
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:25,709
Cut a thing or two in my life.

396
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:30,915
When's the last time
you washed your hands?

397
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:32,817
Relax.

398
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:35,019
I haven't masturbated
since this morning.

399
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:39,923
And on that note, I'm
gonna go make a phone call.

400
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:50,100
I have to stay proactive
on not getting sick.

401
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:53,171
I can't cough up mucus so well.

402
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:56,707
My lungs can fill up.

403
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,276
Mucus and lung fluid.

404
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:01,479
Thanks for sharing.

405
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:03,147
heard from you.

406
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:05,415
Call me back when you get this.

407
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,384
Or text me or something.

408
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,987
Jesus, this knife is terrible.

409
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,389
Hey, Ethel?

410
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,427
Can we get a new
knife over here?

411
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,831
Particularly one
that... cuts things?

412
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,865
Thank you!

413
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:24,401
Can you not make a
big deal out of it?

414
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:26,269
I'm just trying to
help you out, man.

415
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:28,773
I don't need your help.

416
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,710
I just want to be treated
like everyone else.

417
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,478
No, you don't.

418
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,047
You love being treated special.

419
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,914
So what, when someone
holds a door open for you,

420
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:39,984
they're treating you like a kid?

421
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,818
And when they don't,
they're an asshole?

422
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,254
Is that how it works?

423
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:44,989
And at the same time, you
claim you want to be treated

424
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:49,760
like everyone else, but
what you fail to realize

425
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:52,930
is that the longer you focus
on trying to be normal,

426
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:54,264
the longer it's gonna
take you to realize

427
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,734
that nobody's normal, Doug.

428
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,204
How's that?

429
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,377
Thank you.

430
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:08,945
Stop thanking me all the time.

431
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,914
You're sucking all
the fun out of it.

432
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,159
What'd I miss?

433
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:24,828
Can't divulge that
information, ma'am.

434
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:27,031
It's a government secret thing.

435
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,399
We told you, we'd
have to kill ya.

436
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,836
And Doug doesn't wanna have to do that.
Look at him.

437
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,871
Actually, I believe there's
an implied priv clause

438
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:36,307
regarding Las Vegas.

439
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,375
You know what they say.

440
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,045
I'm sorry, what do they say?

441
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:44,182
"What happens in
Vegas, stays in Vegas."

442
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,285
Who the hell says that?

443
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:48,952
It's a saying.

444
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:51,154
From who?

445
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:52,857
People. People say that.

446
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,326
I've lived in Vegas for years,
and I've never heard that.

447
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,395
Seriously?

448
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:00,298
Fuck you.

449
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:02,967
So, who you out there calling?

450
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,502
My boyfriend.

451
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:06,938
He wasn't answering, though.

452
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,807
Boyfriend?

453
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:11,442
Sounds serious.

454
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:14,110
Yeah, it's getting
pretty serious.

455
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:16,280
He's a professor.

456
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,115
And the plot thickens.

457
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:21,418
So, why pray tell, are you
making study dates with Doug

458
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:23,386
if you're already
doing the professor?

459
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,490
Doesn't that, like,
guarantee a passing grade?

460
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:28,425
It's not like that.

461
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,494
He's a great guy.

462
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:34,298
I heard he sleeps with
a lot of his students.

463
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,869
He doesn't do that anymore.

464
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:43,067
So, what do you call a
quadriplegic on a barbecue grill?

465
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,038
Frank.

466
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,072
Alright, alright.

467
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:52,343
What do you call a
quadriplegic under your car?

468
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,480
Jack.

469
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:57,981
Come on, man.

470
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:59,584
Those are funny.

471
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,052
I laughed.

472
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:04,288
You didn't even smile.

473
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,323
You never smile.

474
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,494
Maybe I don't want to.

475
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,497
Bullshit.

476
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:16,733
I can't smile.

477
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:21,239
These muscles in
my face don't work.

478
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:24,075
Or something.

479
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:30,048
I guess it's just
an added bonus.

480
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,284
That's not true.

481
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:35,618
I've seen you smile.

482
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:37,989
You use your eyes.

483
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,625
You just don't do it that often.

484
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:46,163
Maybe I don't have
anything to smile about.

485
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:55,172
My God.

486
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:56,240
What is happening?

487
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:59,376
What are you doing?

488
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,147
Just having a little fun.

489
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,416
Slow down, stranger.

490
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,218
Not a chance.

491
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,622
Say it with me, Doug.

492
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:13,691
Woo!

493
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,127
Woo!

494
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,028
Woo!

495
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:22,132
You guys are fucking insane!

496
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,111
That was not cool.

497
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,048
What's happening?

498
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:38,715
You okay?

499
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:40,084
You need some water?

500
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:42,086
Scott, pull over!

501
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:07,545
What do I do?

502
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:08,478
I don't know.

503
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,580
I've never seen him this bad.

504
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,081
Hit his back or
something, I don't know.

505
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:14,418
Doug!

506
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,253
Doug!

507
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,223
I'm okay.

508
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:21,125
Just give me a minute.

509
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:23,193
My God.

510
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:25,163
I was gonna call 911.

511
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:26,797
Damn it, Doug.

512
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,766
You scared the shit
out of me, man.

513
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,271
I'm fine.

514
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:36,740
Let's keep going.

515
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:49,119
That was terrifying.

516
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,125
You okay?

517
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:55,125
I'm fine.

518
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,260
Just freaked me out a little.

519
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,130
Come on. Let's go.

520
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,484
Look at you.
Look at you.

521
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:55,920
You're beautiful.

522
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,292
Hey, come here.

523
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,226
Come here.

524
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,495
Take a picture.

525
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:05,828
Come on, I got it set up.

526
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:06,730
Shit, I got it on video.

527
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:08,298
Hold on.

528
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:08,766
Alright.

529
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:10,367
Say "cheese."

530
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:14,338
Are we there yet?

531
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,275
See that sign over there?

532
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,744
Yeah.

533
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:24,914
A friend and I stayed out
all night once by that sign,

534
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:27,317
just waiting for a ride.

535
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,753
Why didn't you
stay at a hotel?

536
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,356
Didn't have any money.

537
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,226
That must've sucked.

538
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:41,331
Actually, it was one of
the best nights of my life.

539
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,418
It's calm here.

540
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,920
I've never
seen anything like this.

541
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,788
There's so many people.

542
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,259
This is amazing.

543
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,429
Check it out.

544
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:48,565
We're here.

545
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,873
It's cool?

546
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,914
This is crazy.

547
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:06,383
I wanna gamble.

548
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,286
Slow your roll, buddy.

549
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,588
Let's check out the hotel first.

550
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:18,428
That place looks nice.

551
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:22,699
No, we can't stay there.

552
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,936
I know a place that's
a little better suited

553
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,972
for our price range.

554
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,561
Where'd you hear
that Julian sleeps

555
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:54,431
with a lot of students?

556
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,370
I thought you knew.

557
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,543
Jesus, what do you got
in here, a dead body?

558
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,378
Just books.

559
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,780
Doug and I are supposed
to study this weekend.

560
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:13,983
So, should we meet back
here in a few hours?

561
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:16,787
You ditching us already?

562
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,988
I've just been
stewing in your juices

563
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:18,889
for the last six hours.

564
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:21,425
I could use a shower.

565
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,762
Scott, why don't you show
me those cardshark skills?

566
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:27,463
Pace yourself, captain.

567
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:28,798
Let's check out our room first.

568
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:30,933
There's plenty of time
to spend your money.

569
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:32,869
Great. Well, see
you in a few hours.

570
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,440
Yes, Mom.

571
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:38,742
Yes.

572
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:44,047
I'm fine, Mom.

573
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:47,550
Unacceptable, Doug!

574
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:50,620
We agreed you would not be
going to that awful place!

575
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:51,855
We didn't agree.

576
00:39:51,887 --> 00:39:53,556
Where are you?
I am going to get you.

577
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,025
No, Mom.

578
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:56,726
I just got here.

579
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,030
Well, are you at
least eating enough?

580
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:02,432
Yes, Mom.

581
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:04,101
The hotel clean?

582
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:05,501
It's fine.

583
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:07,538
Do you need anything?

584
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,873
No.

585
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:15,012
You know, the dog
got under the fence

586
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,114
and into the
neighbor's yard today.

587
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,182
Great.

588
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,050
When are you coming home?

589
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,186
I just got here.

590
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:25,822
I'll be home in
a couple of days.

591
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,591
I gotta go, Mom.

592
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:29,459
Wait. Okay, well...

593
00:40:30,025 --> 00:40:31,494
Call us later.

594
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:33,096
I love you.

595
00:40:33,128 --> 00:40:34,597
I love
you, too, Douglas.

596
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:43,574
What's that stain on the bed?

597
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:45,041
Don't worry.

598
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:46,509
That doesn't look like blood.

599
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:47,945
It looks like semen.

600
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,179
Good luck with that.

601
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:51,449
It's your bed.

602
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:59,650
Are you okay?

603
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:09,693
Yeah.

604
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:12,228
I'm great.

605
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:14,164
We've got some time to kill.

606
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,233
You wanna go see your friend?

607
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:21,003
No.

608
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,705
I can take of that later.

609
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:23,639
I need a drink.

610
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,675
Let's roll.

611
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:29,547
You ever play blackjack?

612
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:31,615
On my phone.

613
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:38,755
That's good enough for me.
Let's do it.

614
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:40,324
Okay.

615
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:41,625
Here, do you see this?

616
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:42,659
It's ridiculous.

617
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:43,894
Hey, cutie.

618
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:45,295
Hey.
What's the minimum?

619
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:46,762
$10.

620
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:47,830
$10.

621
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:53,070
You good with that?

622
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:53,737
Yeah.

623
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:54,804
Alright.

624
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:12,990
I think you should...

625
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,791
Yeah.

626
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:16,760
Please. Yeah.

627
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:18,262
Just go ahead.

628
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,170
-Stay.
-Definitely stay.

629
00:43:27,202 --> 00:43:28,838
20, 20.

630
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:33,744
That's fucking sick.

631
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,913
Bust, again.

632
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:41,618
Yes!

633
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,688
This guy's getting
all the good cards.

634
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:45,856
With a face like that,

635
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,791
you should go over
to the poker table.

636
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:49,927
He's mad 'cause he's losing.

637
00:43:53,262 --> 00:43:54,398
Place your bets.

638
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:59,168
No more bets.

639
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:02,306
33, black.

640
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:05,174
Alright, what else?

641
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:08,711
The rest, and then
stuck on two to one.

642
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:09,945
The whole thing?

643
00:44:09,978 --> 00:44:10,946
Yeah.

644
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,715
You sure?

645
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:12,849
Yeah!

646
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:14,217
Place your bets.

647
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,119
Here we go, here
we go, here we go.

648
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:17,420
Wait, nevermind.

649
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,423
My God.

650
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,666
Yes!

651
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,402
-You sure?
-Yeah!

652
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:35,005
Okay. Alright.

653
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:37,273
No more bets.

654
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,344
No more bets, please.

655
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,050
-Green, zero!
-Yeah! Yes!

656
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:51,054
Here we go, here
we go, here we go.

657
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:53,355
11, yes!

658
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:54,791
Did you see that?

659
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:56,026
Look at that.

660
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,163
Come on, come on.

661
00:45:00,195 --> 00:45:01,398
Excuse me, sir.

662
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:02,965
Yeah.

663
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,469
Is he 21?

664
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:06,836
Of course.

665
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:11,173
Could you please
show me some ID?

666
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:12,241
Yeah.

667
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:14,010
It's in your
pocket, right, Doug?

668
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:15,878
Yeah, back pocket.

669
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:17,279
He's pretty heavy.

670
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:19,115
If you maybe get his feet,
help me flip him over,

671
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:20,784
we get it out.

672
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,787
No, that
won't be necessary.

673
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,756
I'm terribly sorry.

674
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,991
He looks young for his age.

675
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:30,960
You have a nice day.

676
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:35,298
You know, you could've
just shown him my ID.

677
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:39,202
Yeah, but that wouldn't
have been as much fun.

678
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:42,005
Refills! Hell yeah!

679
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:44,407
Sorry, it's his first time.

680
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:48,110
Wait, wait, wait.
That's for you.

681
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:49,946
Can I get a straw?

682
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,784
I think she wants the D, Doug.

683
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,552
She's into you.

684
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:56,787
Sure.

685
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,894
Right.

686
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,829
Onward.

687
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:09,032
Where to next?

688
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:11,235
Wherever you want to go, man.

689
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,004
Should we go
pick up Stephanie?

690
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:15,938
Yeah, let's head back.

691
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:22,813
You know what?

692
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,882
I had a lot of fun with you.

693
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:27,250
Thank you.

694
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:28,083
Good.

695
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,452
I did, too.

696
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:30,320
Especially 'cause
you're gonna give me

697
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:31,253
a cut of your winnings.

698
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,291
That's what you think.

699
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,226
Come on. 30%.

700
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:37,293
25%.

701
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,564
10%?

702
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,365
Good luck with that.

703
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:48,371
Dick.

704
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,144
Import prices took
their sharpest plunge

705
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:56,880
in over eight years in March.

706
00:46:56,913 --> 00:47:00,449
As costs of both imported
petroleum and non-petroleum...

707
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:04,387
It's okay to be fat

708
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,300
How do I look?

709
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,069
You look so good, I
could dip you in butter

710
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,172
and sop you up with a biscuit.

711
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,146
So, what do you
guys wanna go do?

712
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:31,914
Whatever.

713
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:33,916
What do you think, Doug?

714
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:35,918
I don't care.

715
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,922
I know a good
bar we could go to.

716
00:47:38,954 --> 00:47:40,623
I'm ready.

717
00:47:42,057 --> 00:47:44,527
Not looking like
that, you're not.

718
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:47,897
This is all I got.

719
00:48:00,976 --> 00:48:04,346
Are glasses really necessary?

720
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,515
No, you look good.

721
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:08,117
Like, Rollercop.

722
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:11,488
I look stupid.

723
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,089
I think you look great.

724
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:14,490
Let's go.

725
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,030
Come on, maverick!

726
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:02,105
Let's go dance!

727
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:06,009
What am I gonna do?

728
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,110
Come dance!

729
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:08,378
Come dance.

730
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,280
Try and have fun, Doug.

731
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:35,338
Come on!

732
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:36,974
Let's see
your moves, Doug.

733
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:46,750
Thanks
a lot, you guys.

734
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:49,518
Thanks for coming
'round to this place.

735
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:01,657
What's up, man?

736
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,394
Where's Stephanie?

737
00:51:06,128 --> 00:51:07,431
Inside.

738
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:22,878
Come on, man.

739
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:24,114
What's wrong?

740
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,116
I just have a headache.

741
00:51:29,851 --> 00:51:32,121
I got something that'll
make you feel better.

742
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:39,228
No.

743
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,196
No, no, no.

744
00:51:40,228 --> 00:51:42,531
I... No, no thank you.

745
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,668
You ever tried it?

746
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:46,635
No.

747
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,605
I don't do drugs.

748
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:51,773
Come on, you take
like 15 pills a day.

749
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:52,974
It's just weed.

750
00:51:53,007 --> 00:51:55,444
It's not like a cigarette with
a bunch of bullshit in it.

751
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:57,847
It's a plant.
It's like cilantro.

752
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,749
But it gets you high.

753
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:05,355
There's no way you're gonna
convince me to smoke pot.

754
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:19,635
When I was a kid,

755
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:24,574
I used to think
drinking and driving

756
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:28,177
meant drinking
anything and driving.

757
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:35,217
So when I saw my dad
drinking coffee and driving,

758
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:39,355
I was like, "My God,
what are you doing?"

759
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,326
Eagle Scout Doug
saves the day.

760
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:45,594
Eagle Scout. Right.

761
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,311
When I was in elementary school,

762
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:06,316
there was this huge
hill by the playground.

763
00:53:09,684 --> 00:53:12,721
It probably wasn't that steep,

764
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:16,659
but when you're a
little kid, you know?

765
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:21,431
So I had one of my friends
push me to the top of the hill.

766
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:27,269
And I would just

767
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:34,277
let go of the brakes and fly.

768
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:52,928
You know, I probably
could've killed myself,

769
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:57,933
but it was just so much fun.

770
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:08,911
What time is it?

771
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:10,547
Who cares?

772
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:16,918
Thank you.

773
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:19,990
For this stuff.

774
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,626
Anytime, man.

775
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:26,895
You wanna trade?

776
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:36,972
This is for concentration.

777
00:54:38,907 --> 00:54:42,645
But it gives you a
pretty good buzz, too.

778
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,487
You're kidding me, right?

779
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,429
I feel fucking amazing.

780
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:00,429
Doug, I need to
use your phone.

781
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,065
Mine's dead.

782
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,436
Thanks.

783
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,673
Hello?

784
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:12,607
Hi.

785
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:13,608
I didn't think you'd be awake.

786
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:15,077
Hi.

787
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,813
Now's not really a good time.

788
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,481
It's two in the morning.

789
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:19,382
What's going on?

790
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:21,917
Nothing.

791
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:22,885
I have to go, okay?

792
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,454
I'll talk to you later.

793
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,889
Who's on the phone?

794
00:55:43,438 --> 00:55:44,507
Hey, Scott.

795
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:46,643
Shit, took you long enough.

796
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:51,447
Busy night, stud?

797
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:54,483
Doug, Elation.

798
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:56,485
Elation, Doug.

799
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:04,460
So this is him?

800
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,431
Hey, baby.

801
00:56:08,463 --> 00:56:11,101
I got you some
entertainment, buddy.

802
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:14,836
Don't worry, man.

803
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:17,572
Elation's all class.

804
00:56:19,574 --> 00:56:21,410
Doug, are you okay with this?

805
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:22,577
He's fine.

806
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,513
Let's give him some alone time.

807
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,083
Have fun, stud-muffin.

808
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:41,730
Hey.

809
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:45,668
Hi.

810
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:50,572
Do you wanna come over
here a little closer,

811
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:52,809
so I can see you?

812
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,777
This is not okay, Scott.

813
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:56,945
He could get hurt
or catch something.

814
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:58,146
Relax.

815
00:56:58,179 --> 00:56:59,481
Elation's a pro.

816
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:01,851
Doug needs someone
to take care of him.

817
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:03,853
That clearly is not you.

818
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:06,688
Maybe you could stop
treating him like a child.

819
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:09,057
You're so irresponsible.

820
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,926
I'm irresponsible?

821
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,896
You're the one fucking
your 50-year-old professor.

822
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:19,969
Yeah.

823
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:21,438
That's right.

824
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,572
Hey.

825
00:57:23,972 --> 00:57:25,708
Hey, hey, hey.

826
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:05,114
So, what do you like?

827
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:12,621
I...

828
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:16,259
I like movies.

829
00:58:20,728 --> 00:58:23,665
That's not what
I meant, darling.

830
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:45,954
Come here.

831
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,653
No don't.

832
00:59:18,686 --> 00:59:21,190
Let's just...

833
00:59:21,222 --> 00:59:23,559
Why don't I help?

834
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:25,728
Sure.

835
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:54,923
Is that okay?

836
00:59:54,956 --> 00:59:56,625
Yeah.

837
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:03,298
Kinky, baby.

838
01:00:17,746 --> 01:00:19,414
Well, at least your dick works.

839
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,033
This is my...

840
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:41,871
My first time.

841
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:02,859
That not okay?

842
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:09,298
No one has ever
touched me like that.

843
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,279
I think there should be a
first time for everything.

844
01:01:59,947 --> 01:02:01,183
Don't you?

845
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:09,858
Now, I'm gonna make
your first time

846
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:12,761
very, very special.

847
01:02:37,018 --> 01:02:38,953
Experience classic value

848
01:02:38,987 --> 01:02:40,956
with rooms starting at $23.

849
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:42,925
Book your stay now, partner.

850
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,527
The Riv's right on the Strip.

851
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,427
Rooms and suites are going fast.

852
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,898
Call 855-468-6748,

853
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:51,567
or go to riveriahotel.com.

854
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:54,804
Mention code RSPC, and...

855
01:03:17,525 --> 01:03:20,495
These eggs are good.

856
01:03:20,528 --> 01:03:21,931
Aren't they, Doug?

857
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,234
I said, "Aren't they, Doug?"

858
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:28,070
Doug.

859
01:03:30,304 --> 01:03:33,375
Scramble my fucking eggs,
you wild stallion!

860
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:36,512
Hey, Doug.

861
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:43,286
I need a new plate.

862
01:03:54,061 --> 01:03:56,231
I should probably
go help him out.

863
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:00,302
Hey.

864
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:01,603
Let me get that for you.

865
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,072
I can manage.

866
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,507
I said I fucking got it!

867
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,045
Aren't you supposed to see
your friend today or something?

868
01:04:10,077 --> 01:04:11,447
Isn't that why we're here?

869
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,615
I don't know.

870
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,983
I gotta... call
and figure it out.

871
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,851
Call who?

872
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:18,053
My friend.

873
01:04:18,085 --> 01:04:19,888
I'm onto you.

874
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:22,056
Yeah?

875
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,559
I know what you're hiding.

876
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:26,128
Why haven't I seen this friend?

877
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:28,931
Does he even have a name?

878
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:30,164
Whatever.

879
01:04:30,197 --> 01:04:31,500
I don't care.

880
01:04:31,532 --> 01:04:33,268
It's cool, man.

881
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:37,072
What the hell are
you talking about?

882
01:04:37,972 --> 01:04:40,074
It's your dealer, isn't it?

883
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:41,543
Yeah, Doug.

884
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:44,914
I drove five hours across
state lines to buy a dime bag.

885
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,583
Get some food in your system.

886
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:50,118
I'm not hungry.

887
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,369
No, I'm having a wonderful time.

888
01:05:08,402 --> 01:05:09,304
Really?

889
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,006
Because you sound kind of sad.

890
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,075
I'm fine.

891
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:15,443
When are you coming home?

892
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:17,478
Probably tomorrow.

893
01:05:19,146 --> 01:05:20,682
I miss you, honey.

894
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:23,084
I miss you, too, Mom.

895
01:05:23,117 --> 01:05:24,219
I gotta go.

896
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:26,288
I'll talk to you later.

897
01:05:34,295 --> 01:05:36,531
I did not give him
permission to go.

898
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,634
What are you gonna do?

899
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:41,269
You certainly can't stop him.

900
01:05:48,443 --> 01:05:52,081
So, what do you
want to do now?

901
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:55,518
Where's Stephanie?

902
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:58,521
I don't know.

903
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:01,155
You wanna go play blackjack?

904
01:06:01,188 --> 01:06:02,057
Nope.

905
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:06,594
You wanna go get a drink?

906
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:08,730
No.

907
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:16,739
What's your problem, man?

908
01:06:16,771 --> 01:06:18,639
What's my problem?

909
01:06:18,672 --> 01:06:20,675
You're my fucking problem!

910
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,377
You selfish asshole!

911
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,280
Are you really that thick?

912
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,415
Doug?

913
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:28,150
Doug.

914
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,354
I wanna go play some games.

915
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:34,522
Can you open the
door for me, please?

916
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:39,527
You want me to come with you?

917
01:06:40,762 --> 01:06:41,998
No.

918
01:09:19,753 --> 01:09:21,623
Are you sure?

919
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:26,295
What, you've never seen
a drunk cripple gamble

920
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,531
his Medicare away?

921
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:38,573
Sure thing.

922
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:43,878
Sorry, buddy.

923
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:49,217
Easy come, easy go.

924
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:02,830
Doug?

925
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:07,301
Where have you been all day?

926
01:10:07,335 --> 01:10:10,305
Make your bets.

927
01:10:10,337 --> 01:10:13,541
I've been here
and there and...

928
01:10:13,574 --> 01:10:15,577
mostly here.

929
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:19,882
And I want you to
meet my friend...

930
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:22,518
Where's Scott?

931
01:10:24,586 --> 01:10:26,222
I don't know.

932
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,262
Come on.

933
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:35,297
Let's go.

934
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:39,900
Save my spot.

935
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:41,637
Sure thing.

936
01:10:56,484 --> 01:10:58,487
I'll be in my room.

937
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:04,793
Scott!

938
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,662
Scott!

939
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:09,398
What the hell?

940
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,431
Hey.

941
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,534
Roll down the window!

942
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:17,372
What?

943
01:11:17,404 --> 01:11:18,340
What are you doing?

944
01:11:18,372 --> 01:11:20,442
Taking my medicine.

945
01:11:22,577 --> 01:11:23,612
You want some?

946
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:25,447
No.

947
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:26,881
What's wrong with you?

948
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:29,418
Nothing.

949
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:31,920
Stephanie wanted
me to talk to you.

950
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:33,388
Stay the fuck out of it, okay?

951
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:36,057
You want me to stay
out of your life?

952
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:39,094
Look who's talking, asshole.

953
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:40,162
What?

954
01:11:40,194 --> 01:11:42,463
You go and you take
away the one thing from me

955
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:44,666
that I really wanted.

956
01:11:44,698 --> 01:11:46,601
Are you kidding me?

957
01:11:47,402 --> 01:11:49,003
I don't need this
right now, man.

958
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:50,972
I got bigger problems
to deal with.

959
01:11:51,005 --> 01:11:52,373
I got problems, too.

960
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:54,409
Yeah, you're in a wheelchair.

961
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:55,609
We get it.

962
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:57,412
You're the only one in the
world whose life isn't perfect.

963
01:11:57,444 --> 01:11:58,779
Fuck you!

964
01:11:58,813 --> 01:12:01,350
You come into my
life out of nowhere.

965
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:04,618
You convince me to
come to this place

966
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:07,556
for a friend of yours,
who as far as I can tell,

967
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:10,024
doesn't exist.

968
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,997
And now, you're moving
in on my personal life.

969
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:19,067
I care about Stephanie.

970
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,535
I don't need this.

971
01:12:20,568 --> 01:12:21,636
I don't need you.

972
01:12:21,668 --> 01:12:22,804
I don't even know you.

973
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:25,407
Then get the
fuck away from me.

974
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,143
Get the fuck away
from me, goddammit!

975
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,519
Where's he going?

976
01:12:37,551 --> 01:12:38,786
What happened?

977
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:40,521
We got into a fight.

978
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:41,456
What?

979
01:12:41,488 --> 01:12:42,490
What did you guys fight about?

980
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,593
You!

981
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:45,527
Me? What?

982
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,462
Why would you fight about me?

983
01:12:47,494 --> 01:12:50,097
You honestly don't know?

984
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:52,567
First, you sleep
with my professor,

985
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,470
then you sleep with my driver.

986
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:58,573
Is there anyone you're not
sleeping with other than me?

987
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,143
Doug.

988
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:04,445
Doug?

989
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:05,581
Hey, Doug.

990
01:13:06,581 --> 01:13:07,582
Should I call someone?

991
01:13:13,654 --> 01:13:15,489
I... I need an ambulance.

992
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,505
Everything's gonna be okay.

993
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:32,440
The sirens.

994
01:13:33,173 --> 01:13:34,810
What's that?

995
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:39,480
Can you turn on the sirens?

996
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,591
What are his vitals?

997
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:53,194
BP 140/100.

998
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,630
Respiration, 32.

999
01:13:55,662 --> 01:13:56,831
Pulse, 118.

1000
01:13:56,864 --> 01:13:58,666
Doors! Doors!

1001
01:14:00,734 --> 01:14:02,636
Get him in, get
him in, get him in.

1002
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,907
I need you to wait outside.

1003
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:07,842
O2 sat,
92 and dropping.

1004
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:12,681
Ready?

1005
01:14:12,713 --> 01:14:15,451
One, two, three.

1006
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,019
Hi.

1007
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:26,688
He's out pretty cold right now.

1008
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,693
What's wrong with him?

1009
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:35,329
Pneumonia.

1010
01:15:35,363 --> 01:15:39,668
But it's very common in
these neuromuscular cases.

1011
01:16:44,265 --> 01:16:45,901
Excuse me.

1012
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:05,787
Hey.

1013
01:17:07,154 --> 01:17:09,157
What are you doing here?

1014
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:11,692
I'm here with Doug.

1015
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,730
Is that your friend?

1016
01:17:20,835 --> 01:17:22,703
Yeah.

1017
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:24,640
Yeah, that's Kevin.

1018
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:29,711
Is, is Kevin your...

1019
01:17:29,743 --> 01:17:32,213
Are you...

1020
01:17:38,886 --> 01:17:39,755
I'm sorry.

1021
01:17:40,787 --> 01:17:42,156
Scott, I get it.

1022
01:17:42,189 --> 01:17:43,724
It's okay.

1023
01:17:49,764 --> 01:17:51,166
What's wrong with Doug?

1024
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:53,867
Is everything okay?

1025
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,371
The doctor said
that he has pneumonia,

1026
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:59,241
and that it's common
with his condition.

1027
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:03,144
I am such a shitty friend.

1028
01:18:03,176 --> 01:18:05,846
I don't think there's
anything you could've done.

1029
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,283
This happens to him a lot.

1030
01:18:10,917 --> 01:18:13,253
He told me about the fight,

1031
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:15,724
and that it was my fault.

1032
01:18:16,123 --> 01:18:17,259
No.

1033
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,162
It was my fault.

1034
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:26,134
How's Kevin?

1035
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:37,846
I should've been
here earlier, but

1036
01:18:37,878 --> 01:18:40,215
his family's here.

1037
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:42,217
I'm sorry.

1038
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,520
Yeah.

1039
01:18:45,552 --> 01:18:47,322
What's going on?

1040
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:56,197
His...

1041
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:58,132
His lungs.

1042
01:19:00,568 --> 01:19:01,837
Hey.

1043
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,118
Hey, Doug.

1044
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,052
Hey.

1045
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,523
How are you feeling?

1046
01:19:22,556 --> 01:19:23,925
Couldn't be better.

1047
01:19:25,259 --> 01:19:27,796
More battle scars.

1048
01:19:27,828 --> 01:19:30,498
Some trip?

1049
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:33,902
You must've had some fun, right?

1050
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,870
Scott showed you how
to play blackjack,

1051
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:37,838
you got lucky with a lady.

1052
01:19:37,872 --> 01:19:41,276
He was determined
to get me to have fun.

1053
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:45,947
No one else even looks at me.

1054
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:48,182
I see you.

1055
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:53,287
I'm sorry about
the way I acted.

1056
01:19:54,588 --> 01:19:57,859
I thought about what you
said, and you were right

1057
01:19:57,891 --> 01:20:00,194
when it comes to
my relationships.

1058
01:20:00,895 --> 01:20:02,964
Where is Scott?

1059
01:20:02,997 --> 01:20:04,065
He's here.

1060
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:06,167
I found him last
night at the ICU,

1061
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:07,969
visiting his friend Kevin.

1062
01:20:08,002 --> 01:20:09,838
When I left, he'd
fallen asleep in a chair

1063
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,506
outside his hospital room.

1064
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:16,009
Doug, did you know
that Scott was...

1065
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:18,145
What?

1066
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:21,382
I think Kevin is more
than just a friend.

1067
01:20:29,023 --> 01:20:30,324
Doug!

1068
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:33,094
My God, honey.
Are you okay?

1069
01:20:33,127 --> 01:20:34,896
I'm fine.

1070
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:36,530
I'm so glad you're alright.

1071
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:37,865
Stephanie called me.

1072
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:40,301
Mom, I'm okay.

1073
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,336
It's just pneumonia.

1074
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:43,637
God.

1075
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:44,972
I knew this would happen.

1076
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:45,940
I knew it.

1077
01:20:45,972 --> 01:20:47,408
I never should've let you come.

1078
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,210
What kind of mother am I?

1079
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:52,013
And you, young lady, I
expected more from you.

1080
01:20:52,613 --> 01:20:54,949
I'll leave the
two of you alone.

1081
01:20:54,981 --> 01:20:56,885
I thank you for calling.

1082
01:20:57,585 --> 01:20:58,418
I'm fine.

1083
01:20:58,452 --> 01:20:59,287
You don't look fine.

1084
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:00,921
You look so pale.

1085
01:21:00,954 --> 01:21:02,556
Are they feeding you?

1086
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:03,958
-Please, I'm fine.
-You shouldn't be

1087
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,759
in your chair, you
should be resting

1088
01:21:04,792 --> 01:21:07,395
so the infection
doesn't get worse.

1089
01:21:07,427 --> 01:21:09,529
I'm fine.

1090
01:21:10,331 --> 01:21:13,001
Look, this is empty!

1091
01:21:14,935 --> 01:21:15,636
Nurse!

1092
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:16,503
Mom, don't.

1093
01:21:16,537 --> 01:21:17,505
God.

1094
01:21:17,537 --> 01:21:19,506
Excuse me!

1095
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:21,275
Can I help you with something?

1096
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,043
Yes.

1097
01:21:23,077 --> 01:21:25,280
Fill this.

1098
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:32,921
What are you doing out of bed?

1099
01:21:33,954 --> 01:21:34,655
Come on.

1100
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,124
Mom!

1101
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:40,362
Stop treating me like I'm
a goddamn cripple child.

1102
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:44,399
Dad's dead, not me.

1103
01:21:45,265 --> 01:21:47,534
I'm just worried about you.

1104
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:51,506
I'm worried about you,

1105
01:21:53,006 --> 01:21:55,943
but I don't treat you

1106
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:59,046
like a goddamn crazy person.

1107
01:22:04,018 --> 01:22:05,921
Go home, Mom.

1108
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:18,500
He was here.

1109
01:22:22,168 --> 01:22:24,072
How's Kevin?

1110
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:26,541
I'm so sorry.

1111
01:22:26,573 --> 01:22:28,742
Where's Scott?

1112
01:22:28,775 --> 01:22:31,244
The friend that was with him.

1113
01:22:31,278 --> 01:22:33,347
He left earlier.

1114
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:36,518
Thanks.

1115
01:22:42,422 --> 01:22:43,557
Come on.

1116
01:23:04,345 --> 01:23:05,179
Look at you.

1117
01:23:05,212 --> 01:23:06,147
Look at you.

1118
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,215
You're beautiful.

1119
01:23:09,182 --> 01:23:10,118
Hey, come here.

1120
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:10,751
Come here.

1121
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:11,652
Take a picture.

1122
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:13,188
Come on, I got it set up.

1123
01:23:15,122 --> 01:23:16,391
Alright, you ready?

1124
01:23:16,423 --> 01:23:17,658
Smile.

1125
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:18,458
Smile.

1126
01:23:18,492 --> 01:23:19,494
There you go, smiling.

1127
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,261
Alright, say "cheese."

1128
01:23:21,295 --> 01:23:23,064
Say "cheese."

1129
01:23:23,096 --> 01:23:24,733
Cheese.

1130
01:23:25,498 --> 01:23:26,434
Shit, I got it on video.

1131
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:28,103
Hold on, hold on.

1132
01:23:35,676 --> 01:23:36,511
There he is!

1133
01:23:36,543 --> 01:23:38,278
By the sign!

1134
01:23:38,311 --> 01:23:40,247
Pull the van over.

1135
01:23:56,529 --> 01:23:58,065
Hey, wait.

1136
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:00,068
I should talk to him.

1137
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,036
He's my friend.

1138
01:24:03,136 --> 01:24:05,139
Okay, I'll wait here.

1139
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,087
Scott.

1140
01:24:20,587 --> 01:24:22,423
What are you doing here?

1141
01:24:23,823 --> 01:24:25,326
What?

1142
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:27,429
What are you doing here?

1143
01:24:28,328 --> 01:24:29,730
Going.

1144
01:24:30,163 --> 01:24:31,865
Going?

1145
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:34,235
Going where?

1146
01:24:34,268 --> 01:24:36,136
The hell do you want, Doug?

1147
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,840
I wanna talk to you.

1148
01:24:42,176 --> 01:24:43,144
I don't.

1149
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:49,150
I'm sorry about what I said.

1150
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,188
That's nice to hear.

1151
01:25:02,195 --> 01:25:04,466
He wouldn't let me see him.

1152
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:07,301
He wouldn't let me see him,

1153
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,836
'cause he didn't want to
die with his family thinking

1154
01:25:08,868 --> 01:25:10,838
he was a faggot.

1155
01:25:11,838 --> 01:25:14,141
Guess he got his wish.

1156
01:25:16,609 --> 01:25:19,646
Do you have any idea
how that feels, Doug?

1157
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:24,217
No.

1158
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:25,386
Scott.

1159
01:25:27,954 --> 01:25:30,291
You don't even know me!

1160
01:25:30,323 --> 01:25:32,692
I don't even know me!

1161
01:25:32,725 --> 01:25:34,728
I'm not a good person, Doug.

1162
01:25:34,761 --> 01:25:36,229
I used you!

1163
01:25:36,262 --> 01:25:38,466
That's what kind of person I am.

1164
01:25:38,498 --> 01:25:41,202
That's why I don't
have any real friends!

1165
01:25:42,302 --> 01:25:44,538
Stay away from
people like me, Doug!

1166
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:49,844
My God!

1167
01:25:49,877 --> 01:25:52,446
Stephanie!

1168
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:53,681
Scott!

1169
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:54,649
God.

1170
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:59,320
No, no, no, no.

1171
01:26:07,528 --> 01:26:09,530
My God.

1172
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:12,632
My God.

1173
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:14,534
My God.

1174
01:26:14,568 --> 01:26:15,936
No, no...

1175
01:27:00,881 --> 01:27:02,350
Hey, Mom.

1176
01:27:02,382 --> 01:27:04,484
Yeah, honey, what's up?

1177
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,324
We really need to
get rid of that thing.

1178
01:27:10,623 --> 01:27:11,524
No, no, no.

1179
01:27:11,557 --> 01:27:12,859
I'm, too busy now, honey.

1180
01:27:12,893 --> 01:27:14,261
I have too much going on.

1181
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,264
I mean, even today, you know.

1182
01:27:16,296 --> 01:27:18,665
I have yoga, and then I
have lunch with Gwyneth

1183
01:27:18,698 --> 01:27:20,400
in Santa Monica.

1184
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:21,902
Do you know how hard it
is to park over there?

1185
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:23,504
Then I have to go to
the wallpaper store...

1186
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:25,972
Mom, it's time to move on.

1187
01:27:26,006 --> 01:27:29,310
I am not going to
throw your father away.

1188
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:31,679
We're doing fine without him.

1189
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:34,548
It's been almost a year.

1190
01:27:34,581 --> 01:27:36,284
We need to do this.

1191
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,319
That isn't Dad.

1192
01:27:39,353 --> 01:27:41,788
It's just ash.

1193
01:27:43,423 --> 01:27:47,362
We could take him to the beach.

1194
01:27:48,061 --> 01:27:49,963
We met at the beach.

1195
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:53,534
When I saw him coming
out of the ocean,

1196
01:27:53,567 --> 01:27:56,337
I knew right away.

1197
01:27:57,371 --> 01:27:59,440
Dad loved you.

1198
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:06,948
He used to take
you to the pool.

1199
01:28:08,782 --> 01:28:11,386
Yeah, I remember.

1200
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:15,657
He was so handsome
in his little shorts.

1201
01:28:49,789 --> 01:28:51,591
Bye, Dad.

1202
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:55,429
The tortoise
spends most of its life

1203
01:28:55,462 --> 01:28:59,600
slowly and quietly
wandering the desert.

1204
01:29:00,466 --> 01:29:02,036
Some go their entire lives

1205
01:29:02,069 --> 01:29:06,874
without even seeing
another one of their kind.

1206
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,543
In a lot of ways,

1207
01:29:10,644 --> 01:29:12,347
I can relate to this.

1208
01:29:15,047 --> 01:29:18,853
We both spend a
lot of time alone.

1209
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:24,425
We both would be in trouble
if flipped on our backs.

1210
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:29,630
We both have shells.

1211
01:29:31,998 --> 01:29:34,836
The difference is

1212
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:40,541
I've chosen to be
trapped inside my shell.

1213
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:45,645
For so long,

1214
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,681
I thought it was my illness

1215
01:29:48,715 --> 01:29:52,019
that was closing me
off to this world.

1216
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:57,858
I started to see myself

1217
01:29:57,890 --> 01:30:01,628
as others saw me:

1218
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:08,101
disabled and powerless.

1219
01:30:14,807 --> 01:30:18,578
My best friend

1220
01:30:18,612 --> 01:30:21,782
once told me

1221
01:30:21,814 --> 01:30:26,586
that I liked being
treated special,

1222
01:30:28,855 --> 01:30:31,692
and he was right.

1223
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:38,466
By showing me myself,

1224
01:30:41,601 --> 01:30:45,572
he drove me to be better.

1225
01:30:48,207 --> 01:30:52,646
He also taught me to
open up to this world.

1226
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:01,756
So, to this world I say,

1227
01:31:02,588 --> 01:31:04,492
"Fuck this.

1228
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:08,930
"Fuck my lame body.

1229
01:31:09,695 --> 01:31:13,835
"I refuse to be bound by it.

1230
01:31:15,668 --> 01:31:19,474
"Fuck close-minded people.

1231
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,578
"I refuse to be defined by them.

1232
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:32,552
"And I refuse to wander

1233
01:31:35,021 --> 01:31:38,292
"quiet and desperate

1234
01:31:38,324 --> 01:31:40,595
"in the desert."

1235
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:49,636
Thank you.
