00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:47,825
<i>Today marks an important
milestone at Invespia.</i>

3
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,963
<i>Two years ago, we set out to
architect a cryptocurrency exchange</i>

4
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:55,967
<i>that would elevate the trajectory
of global finances forever.</i>

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,803
<i>Well, thanks to all of you,
I am humbled to announce</i>

6
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:02,139
<i>that we have exceeded
our annual investment goals.</i>

7
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:08,712
<i>I deeply appreciate the trust, friendship
and support of every Invespia partner.</i>

8
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,949
<i>Now, I know it's become
a bit cliché in the tech world,</i>

9
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:15,086
<i>but this is not hyperbole
when I say that we are</i>

10
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:19,323
<i>in the process of changing
the world as we know it.</i>

11
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:20,724
[chuckles]

12
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,261
Yeah, dude.

13
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:24,996
You're the fucking cliché.

14
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,799
[exhales]

15
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,407
[tense music playing]

16
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:50,620
Target on the move.
Local on standby.

17
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,126
I'm sure you're wondering
what a handsome Brit like me

18
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,726
is doing all the way out here.

19
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,897
Well, mate, this is a great
place to meet women.

20
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,299
[laughs]

21
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,833
I tell, ya.

22
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,668
And it's excellent, as long as
you know how to drive,

23
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:07,238
the GPS does all the work
for you, right.

24
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,873
Which is a good plan,

25
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,309
as long as you're not driving
out in the middle of nowhere

26
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,077
where the GPS don't work.

27
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,014
I guess what I'm saying is I
hope you know where you're going.

28
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:19,817
Hello?

29
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:22,253
Where you going?

30
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,854
Oh, yeah.

31
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,566
It looks like
it's the next left

32
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,135
<i>about three miles up.</i>

33
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,138
[driver] <i>You're traveling light.</i>

34
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:43,707
[Paul] <i>Yeah, just here for
a business meeting.</i>

35
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,142
Actually, would you
mind waiting for me?

36
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:47,812
I'm, uh, gonna try to catch
the 3:00 outta here.

37
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:51,548
Oh, sure. Do you want me
to grab you a coffee, as well?

38
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,451
Milk, sugar?

39
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,885
No, I'm not waiting.

40
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,187
This ain't a limo.

41
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,422
Okay.

42
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:00,992
<i>I mean, how am I supposed to get
another car if there's no GPS?</i>

43
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,060
[driver] <i>I don't know, mate.
That sounds like something</i>

44
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:04,895
<i>you should've pre-planned,
don't you think?</i>

45
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,030
[Paul] <i>Right.</i>

46
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:11,634
We lost contact.

47
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,031
Hi, Robert. This is a beautiful
day today, isn't it?

48
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,632
It sure is.

49
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:20,504
Good morning, sir.
And how are you today?

50
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:23,074
Another day in paradise.

51
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,709
So we received
an interesting call.

52
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,112
[Robert] Interesting?

53
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:30,247
From your son.

54
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:33,650
I wasn't going to speak with
him, but he's coming for a visit.

55
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:35,119
Everything okay?

56
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:38,355
His flight has already landed.
I can't wait to meet him.

57
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,360
Kate to base.
Do you copy?

58
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,338
[grunts]
[chuckles]

59
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:58,876
[cell phone ringing]

60
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,112
- Go for Ulysses.
- [man] Come on, man.

61
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,313
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:03,746
Copy that.

63
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,650
They're telegraphing a bat cave.

64
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:15,692
Ready for this?

65
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,667
Listen up, everybody.

66
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:30,174
The mission is simple;
get in and get out quietly.

67
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,610
Neutralize anybody
that stands in your way.

68
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,080
Acquire the assets
alive for the boss.

69
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:38,415
- Am I clear?
- [all] Yes, sir.

70
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,353
[scoffs]

71
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:43,787
Let's load up.

72
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,036
[door opens]

73
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,045
Good God.

74
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,153
What's that?

75
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,688
This, mate, is where
you told me to take you.

76
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:27,331
What's this all about?

77
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,001
- Hey, how...
- [guard] Please turn off

78
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,137
your vehicle's
engine, sir.

79
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,507
This is private property.
No unauthorized vehicles are allowed

80
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,707
- on our premises.
- Alright.

81
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,077
They're expecting me.
My name's Paul Michaels.

82
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,079
May I please see your
security access credentials?

83
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:45,216
Credentials? I'm here to see my
father, Robert Michaels.

84
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,418
Sorry, Mr. Michaels,
all visitors are required to have

85
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,953
security clearance
credentials.

86
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:52,022
At a retirement community?
I mean, that-that's ridiculous.

87
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,426
[driver] Oh, hello.

88
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,860
Hey, Matthews.

89
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,930
Is this guy for real?

90
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,666
Keep your eyes on them.

91
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,001
Roger that.

92
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,072
Mate, are you sure
you want me to leave you here?

93
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:09,739
[sighs] TBD.

94
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,044
It's alright,
Mr. Michaels is authorized.

95
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,913
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,082
[driver] That a friend of yours?

97
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:19,516
[Paul] Not yet.

98
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,784
Get out.

99
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:22,553
The Terminator's coming back.

100
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,521
Mr. Michaels,
you're free to enter.

101
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,056
Just you.

102
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,324
Yeah.

103
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:29,927
Mate, where I'm from, getting
rescued by a beautiful woman,

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,028
that's a good piece of luck.

105
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,297
Definitely a step up from you,
my friend.

106
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,965
[driver chuckles]

107
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,475
We got last
known location.

108
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:49,480
Let's move.

109
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:53,784
[mutters]

110
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:56,220
[speaks Spanish]

111
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:13,470
Kate Taylor.
I'm the director here.

112
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:14,905
Nice to meet you,
Miss Taylor.

113
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:17,708
Miss Taylor sounds rather like
a junior high teacher.

114
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:18,976
Call me Kate.

115
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:21,912
[chuckles] What's with
the Fort Knox routine, Kate?

116
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,881
Just a formality,
Mr. Michaels.

117
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,416
Well, if you're Kate
then I'm Paul.

118
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,885
Fair enough.

119
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,820
I've heard a lot
about you, Paul.

120
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:32,189
Oh, yeah?
What'd you hear?

121
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:34,091
Your dad
is very proud of you.

122
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,061
Is he? Are we talking
about the same guy?

123
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,430
I'll escort him
from here.

124
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,232
[keypad beeping]

125
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:49,973
So, what is this place?

126
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,709
I mean, I thought this was
a retirement community,

127
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:52,777
what's up with the guards?

128
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,745
They take their jobs
here quite seriously,

129
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:55,846
as well they should.

130
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,048
Forge Mountain is an
invitation-only,

131
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,517
one-of-a-kind
destination retreat

132
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,453
for executives
in need of a reset.

133
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:04,254
Invitation-only retreat?

134
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,522
Marketing lingo.

135
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:08,492
Basically, we have a network
of corporate partners

136
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,562
and offer a variety of on-site
programs for their executives.

137
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,798
I thought you said my father
had been living here for years.

138
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,132
Also true.

139
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:17,769
We have a very few
who are long-term residents.

140
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:20,437
Never would've imagined my dad
living in a place like this.

141
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,973
Wasn't much of an outdoorsman
when I was a kid.

142
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:26,577
Well, I'm sure you two
have quite a lot to catch up on.

143
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,911
Hm.

144
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,054
I'm still getting nothing.

145
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:41,760
That's fine.

146
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,160
They can't have gotten far.

147
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,396
We'll catch up
and intercept them.

148
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:56,140
Ah, did they warn you of the
communication challenges here?

149
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:58,877
No.

150
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:03,080
The original architects in the
'50s labeled it an energy vortex.

151
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,349
And what's that mean exactly?

152
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:08,018
An area conducive
to spiritual healing.

153
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,686
Sounds very scientific.

154
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,388
[chuckles]
The scientific explanation

155
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,793
is that there's a large
concentration of a rare iron ore

156
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:16,393
that scrambles the
electromagnetic waves,

157
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:19,363
making satellite communication
next to impossible.

158
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:21,866
It's called "native dead space"
in the satellite tech world.

159
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,434
- Ah...
- I was hell-bent

160
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,002
on a career at NASA
when I was a kid.

161
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,538
I was obsessed with
the place beyond the sky.

162
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:29,072
- You know?
- Oh.

163
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,875
So, did you do it?

164
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,709
Well, my mother
was a music teacher

165
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:34,378
and my dad sold medical devices.

166
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,113
Not exactly
astronaut pedigree.

167
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,816
- Yeah.
- But I play a mean recorder.

168
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,149
[Kate laughs]

169
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,387
[tires screech]

170
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,556
- [horn honks]
- What's going on?

171
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,027
Howdy, thanks for stopping.

172
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,662
Not like I had
a lot of choice, was it?

173
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,331
Listen, we're part of a
special forces team for the DEA,

174
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,666
and we're gonna need your help.

175
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,967
My help?

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,303
Yes. Can you give me the address
of your last drop off?

177
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:02,306
[chuckles] Look, mate,
I can't give you the addresses...

178
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,376
It's very urgent. See, the man
that you just dropped off...

179
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,480
well, he's transporting a very
deadly, new synthetic drug.

180
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,783
Look, mate, I don't
want to get involved, honestly.

181
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:12,884
I'm late for where I'm going.

182
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,518
Hey, can we move this shit
out of the road?

183
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:15,986
I wanna go!

184
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,655
- Are you guys serious?
- Do I not look serious?

185
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:23,828
Yeah, look, you do, but...

186
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:24,929
Look, mate,
you gotta talk to the company

187
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:26,063
if you want
that sort of information.

188
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:27,464
I could lose my job over...

189
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,599
[choking]

190
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:31,568
You're gonna lose a lot more
than your job, friend.

191
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:37,574
Look...
there wasn't an address.

192
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:40,511
The guy had directions
on a piece of paper.

193
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:42,012
That's it!

194
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,915
I can't remember
anything else.

195
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:45,015
Think.

196
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:47,217
[choking]

197
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:48,151
Fuck.

198
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,922
Okay. Okay, alright.

199
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:55,058
It's about ten miles down
on County Line 12.

200
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:57,027
There's a dirt road on the left,
there's no sign,

201
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,029
it's just a dirt road.

202
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,465
There's a gate...
opens to the gate.

203
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:04,101
There's guards
at the gate at the end.

204
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:07,437
- Are they armed?
- Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,077
[panting]

206
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,180
Thank you for your help.

207
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:24,721
Hey, you expect a
strongly-worded email to the DEA!

208
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,423
I know my rights!

209
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:31,896
Hey, you tell your partner to...

210
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,130
[man] Nothing personal.

211
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,800
- Hey... Wait, wait...
- [gunshot]

212
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,290
Please, don't take this wrong,
but I'm curious to know

213
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:01,960
how you found
your father was here.

214
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:04,428
Our residents have a saying
that anonymity

215
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:07,932
is Forge Mountain's
most attractive amenity.

216
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:09,466
Sorry to pry.

217
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,269
Don't be sorry.
I'm sure it's not a secret,

218
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:13,704
we haven't spoken
in a long time.

219
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,609
An attorney that manages
my mother's family estate

220
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:19,911
put me in touch.

221
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,612
I'm sure he's
excited to see you.

222
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,213
[Paul chuckles]

223
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:26,350
- Really?
- Yes.

224
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:28,385
You're not
a great liar, Kate.

225
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:31,956
Alright, in all honesty,
he was completely shocked.

226
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,458
But I'm sure he's happy
to see you.

227
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,528
Ah, here we have
all the amenities:

228
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:42,432
pool, target range,
river with loads of fish.

229
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,936
And in the summer months
there are so many grandkids

230
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,638
and nieces and nephews,
it becomes a perfect playground.

231
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,640
You're very passionate
about the place.

232
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:51,575
I am.

233
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:56,279
[sighs] We have our dining
hall, Michelin starred chef.

234
00:14:56,313 --> 00:15:00,217
And loads of outdoor activities:
yoga and tai chi

235
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,319
and the book reading club.

236
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,588
Well, everyone seems
very happy.

237
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,125
You must be
doing something right.

238
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,394
- [groans]
- And loads of bugs. [chuckles]

239
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,633
[tense music playing]

240
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:16,094
Strange, boss, I've got no
overhead of that entire forest.

241
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,661
It's like some black hole.

242
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:23,768
Got eyes on the dirt road the
driver says ends at the gate.

243
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:26,636
Weird. I got no map of that.

244
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,509
Now look at the clearing
in the trees.

245
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,712
[woman] Perimeter fencing.

246
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,049
That's a lot of land.

247
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:40,317
What is that place?

248
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,720
Got a few ideas.
Only one way to find out.

249
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:44,822
Move out.

250
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:57,969
It appears the target has moved
into some sort of compound.

251
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,538
[indistinct]

252
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:04,208
Zero visibility and likely
no outside communication.

253
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:05,609
Over.

254
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:07,444
[man on radio] <i>Infiltrate
and secure the targets.</i>

255
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:09,213
<i>Use any means necessary.</i>

256
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,949
<i>Targets must be taken alive.
I'm on my way.</i>

257
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:14,351
Copy that, sir.

258
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:31,635
[Kate] These are the long-term
resident cottages.

259
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:34,337
A bit more roomy
and much more secluded.

260
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,007
And here we are.

261
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:45,715
[door opens]

262
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,755
Good to see you, Paul.

263
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:52,023
[door closes]

264
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,759
Hey, Dad.

265
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,432
Oh... okay, then.
I'll let you two catch up.

266
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:03,835
[Robert] Thanks, Kate.

267
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:07,805
Come inside. Relax.

268
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,906
Come on.

269
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:12,977
[tense music playing]

270
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,388
[Robert] Take a seat.

271
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,729
You look well, Dad.

272
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,731
I stay busy.

273
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,667
Well, that's good,
you'll live longer.

274
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,937
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, that's what they say.

275
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:44,075
So I saw
the Prairie View house sold.

276
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:45,442
Yeah.

277
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,012
I loved that house.

278
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,681
We had some good times there.

279
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:58,421
Did, uh... did Uncle Bill or
Aunt Katie get in touch with you?

280
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,426
Not since your, uh,
your mom died.

281
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,528
Dad, you vanished.

282
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,265
I tried to contact you
for years.

283
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:09,200
It was a difficult time.

284
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:12,535
Yeah, well, that's no reason to
shut everyone out and disappear.

285
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,772
Look, I know emotions ran high
after the funeral,

286
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,539
but that was three years ago.

287
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:19,743
We need to try
to put things back together.

288
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:25,883
I think we should have a...
a serious talk.

289
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,223
Yeah, there is, uh, something
I'd like to talk to you about.

290
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,625
But I'm-I'm gonna hit the bathroom
first, if you don't mind.

291
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,033
[tense music playing]

292
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,795
Got a security cam,
over.

293
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,398
What are we
walking into here, boss?

294
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,599
Doesn't matter,
the job is clear.

295
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:25,475
[tense music playing]

296
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:55,239
[sighs]

297
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,946
[exhales]

298
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,747
[water running]

299
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,519
[door closes]

300
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:19,997
You can do this, Paul.

301
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,233
You deserve this.

302
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,537
Okay.

303
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:32,009
You heard
of cryptocurrency, Dad?

304
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:33,844
Digital assets.

305
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:35,446
You've heard of Bitcoin,
right?

306
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,814
Yeah, sure.

307
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,749
Well, I wanna show you
how our marketplace

308
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:41,786
streams transactions
in real time.

309
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,888
Just like a stock exchange.

310
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,225
Real time, huh?

311
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,727
Okay.

312
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:52,396
Glad you're excited.

313
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,232
- What?
- There's no WIFI here.

314
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,733
[chuckles]

315
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,137
This is my company.

316
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:01,372
Invespia.

317
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,141
Ah. How'd you get online?

318
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,676
My entire existence
resides in the ether.

319
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:09,246
I can get online
from the bottom of the ocean.

320
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,017
You know, I lived and breathed this
company for the past five years.

321
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,286
We're gonna revolutionize the
world's relationship to money.

322
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:19,090
We have a ten-year road map that
will not only solidify Invespia

323
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:20,958
as an industry leader
in cryptocurrency,

324
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:24,128
but as a major player in the
global financial marketplace.

325
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,766
I'm really happy for you,
son.

326
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,674
What do you got there,
kitty cat?

327
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,811
Magnetic plastic putty.

328
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,880
Scrambles the camera signal,

329
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:45,483
doesn't send
a hardware failure alert.

330
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:47,485
[Ulysses on radio]
<i>On my signal, Alpha.</i>

331
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,153
Don't miss.

332
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,930
Miss Garner,
I've got a camera down.

333
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:10,241
[Garner] Yeah, looks like
another wiring short.

334
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:13,710
Damn ambrosia beetles
chew up the cables.

335
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:16,147
Just take it offline for now.

336
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:18,916
Okay.

337
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:26,991
You know what, send a north boundary
patrol down to check it out.

338
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,194
Roger that, ma'am.

339
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,266
Alpha team, go.

340
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:07,264
Jones, do you copy?

341
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:10,334
Jones, come in for base camp.
Do you copy?

342
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:12,702
[exhales]

343
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:16,073
We've, uh...
We've hit a bump in the road.

344
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:20,878
A key investor's pulled out
at the worst possible time...

345
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:25,616
pushing the exchange
to the verge of destabilization.

346
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:26,884
Sounds rough.

347
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:28,886
What are your options?

348
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,588
We need a quick
injection of cash.

349
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:35,092
A stop gap, until I can finalize
a pending strategic merger.

350
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:37,995
How much?

351
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,331
Five million.

352
00:24:41,332 --> 00:24:42,732
Five million?

353
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:46,170
Does it look like
I have five million?

354
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:52,276
What's this?

355
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,878
Closing documents
for a short-term loan.

356
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:58,649
What collateral?

357
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:00,784
Guess the land
in my mom's family trust.

358
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:02,286
Is this a joke?

359
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:14,365
We've got a local.
Hold your positions.

360
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,901
Turn to channel three.

361
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:25,843
- [static buzzes]
- Sandra, what's, uh...

362
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:27,711
- [static]
- [dialogue choppy]

363
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:30,648
Jones, you're breaking up.
Do you copy?

364
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:33,017
[static ringing]

365
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,153
Sandrita, do you copy?

366
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,127
He's got a sidearm.

367
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,529
Hold. Hold.

368
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:48,499
I have every right to borrow
against my inheritance.

369
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:49,667
It's not yours yet.

370
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,468
That's why I'm asking
for your help.

371
00:25:53,904 --> 00:25:55,973
You only came here for money.

372
00:25:58,242 --> 00:25:59,443
I shoulda known.

373
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,711
You disappeared.

374
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:02,781
I-I haven't heard from you
in three years.

375
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:03,847
Nobody has.

376
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:05,716
Bullshit.

377
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:07,217
You know nothing.

378
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:21,632
Well, so far so good.
What's the plan?

379
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,033
We'll take him
when he doubles back.

380
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,368
That camera
will be back up soon.

381
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:27,338
Better he sees a hole in
the fence than nine commandos.

382
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:28,439
Copy that.

383
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:36,246
Your mother
never wanted that money.

384
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,350
She turned her back
on the family, not me.

385
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,553
- Why?
- It's complicated.

386
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:43,921
[scoffs]

387
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:46,123
Yeah, well,
life's complicated, Dad.

388
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:49,126
Especially if you don't
run away from it and hide.

389
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:55,733
Look, this is my last chance.

390
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,968
Everything I've built
is about to implode.

391
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,270
Good people will lose
their life savings.

392
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:02,841
I know it's been
a difficult couple of years.

393
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:06,343
But for the first time
in my life I need your help.

394
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,512
You don't understand.

395
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:11,415
[scoffs]

396
00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:15,185
No, I understand everything.

397
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,921
You've been absent my whole
life, work always came first.

398
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:20,557
I had to teach myself
how to be a man.

399
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:22,626
Even when Mom got sick.

400
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:26,798
You left me
to take care of her, too.

401
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,966
Is that why you got
the old photo album out,

402
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,601
to remember who I am?

403
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:33,370
This was a huge mistake.

404
00:27:40,644 --> 00:27:42,179
[door closes]

405
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:49,186
[Jones] Sandra, come in.

406
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:52,356
It's almost time,
my shift is over.

407
00:27:53,957 --> 00:27:55,559
We should
take this guy out.

408
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,562
Hold your position.

409
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,499
There's a hole
in that fucking fence.

410
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,001
Do we have a problem?

411
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:06,703
No problem, boss.
Standing by.

412
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:08,005
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

413
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:09,339
I've been on sites
like this,

414
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:11,141
the government
sets these traps.

415
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:14,144
If they hit the alarm,
we're all fucking cooked.

416
00:28:14,178 --> 00:28:16,079
I say we
get that motherfucker now.

417
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:35,065
Fuck this shit,
you're on your own.

418
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:37,201
What the hell do you
think you're doing, soldier?

419
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,536
- <i>Stand down.</i>
- It's that bullshit.

420
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,574
[Jones] Sandra.

421
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,844
Base.

422
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:47,478
Base, we have a problem.

423
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,546
The fence has been...

424
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,682
[static buzzing]

425
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:54,084
Fence?

426
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:56,386
<i>What's wrong
with the fence, Jones?</i>

427
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:05,529
Jones, the camera's back up.
Do you copy?

428
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,966
Jones, behind you!

429
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,600
[groans]

430
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,536
Holy shit.

431
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:17,007
Dang it.

432
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,342
Miss Garner!

433
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:22,179
- What happened?
- Jones was ambushed!

434
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:24,147
- They killed him?
- [Garner] Who?

435
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:26,316
What...

436
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:35,692
Who the hell is that?

437
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:37,461
[gunshot]

438
00:29:40,597 --> 00:29:42,466
Holy shit.

439
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:50,707
Issue a code black.

440
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:52,709
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay.

441
00:29:52,743 --> 00:29:54,378
We have to lockdown immediately.

442
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:01,652
If anyone on this team
compromises the mission,

443
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:04,555
<i>you will be removed
without hesitation.</i>

444
00:30:04,588 --> 00:30:07,457
No second chances.

445
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:12,129
We need to split up, sweep these
cabins, and secure the targets alive.

446
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:13,932
By any means necessary.

447
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:15,867
Let's move out.

448
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,701
[mutters]
You heard him, move out.

449
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:29,013
[Paul] What was I thinking?

450
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:30,147
This was a fucking mistake,

451
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,983
I knew I shouldn't have
come here.

452
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,517
[mutters]

453
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:34,544
[door opens]

454
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,882
You been keeping tabs on me?

455
00:31:38,582 --> 00:31:40,118
Of course.

456
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,451
You're my son.

457
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,121
So you knew about Invespia,

458
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,188
but you let me
make my pitch anyway?

459
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:47,457
Yeah, it was cute.

460
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,659
[chuckles]

461
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:50,795
- Cute?
- Yeah.

462
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:55,833
[sighs]

463
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:57,701
Have a nice life.

464
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:58,803
I'll do it.

465
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,939
I'll sign it.

466
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:06,110
Thanks, Dad.

467
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,879
But first we gotta talk.

468
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:09,914
[alarm blaring]

469
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,087
What the fuck is that?

470
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,355
It's an emergency alert.

471
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,691
- What kind of emergency?
- Just relax.

472
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:23,393
- It's a drill.
- What is this place, Dad?

473
00:32:23,427 --> 00:32:24,461
Really?

474
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:27,664
It's complicated.

475
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:29,533
Complicated?

476
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:31,301
Complicated.

477
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:37,909
[man] Come on, come on.
Push it, push it.

478
00:32:37,942 --> 00:32:39,844
That's it, that's it. Come on.

479
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,352
Hey, can I offer you
guys a water?

480
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,122
- [door closes]
- [man] Drive.

481
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:52,656
Okay.

482
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,227
[gunshots]

483
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,864
Were those gunshots?

484
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,299
- Yes.
- What the fuck, Dad?

485
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:04,936
Hang tight, I'll look.

486
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:06,536
Is that a silencer?

487
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:09,573
I'll be right back.

488
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:11,008
[door closes]

489
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:20,283
[panting]

490
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,659
Where is he?

491
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:33,865
Fuck you.
I'm not telling you shit.

492
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:35,398
[soft chuckle]

493
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:41,239
[gun cocks]

494
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:45,675
Where?

495
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,011
Fuck you.

496
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,353
- [silenced gunshot]
- [groans]

497
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:58,790
[people yelling in distance]

498
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,726
- Thanks.
- Paul's inside.

499
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,828
Roger.

500
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:05,595
Get to the fortress.

501
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:07,765
[gunshots]

502
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,233
- Where's my dad?
- Come on, we're leaving.

503
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,534
No, what's going on, Kate?

504
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,203
We have to get to the fortress.
Code black.

505
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:14,071
Code black?
What's the fortress?

506
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:15,173
It's our emergency shelter.

507
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,240
- Okay, well...
- Get your bag.

508
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:17,674
What's the emergency?

509
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:20,477
You know,
I should go help my dad,

510
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,313
he probably doesn't even know
how to use that thing.

511
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:26,650
- [silenced gunshots]
- [people yelling]

512
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:31,823
- Was that my dad?
- Come on, we're going out the back.

513
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:35,692
- McNeill.
- Yeah, boss?

514
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,394
Main unit's requesting backup
at residential.

515
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:39,329
I'm heading over to assist.
Nobody in or out.

516
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,597
Copy that.

517
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:51,641
Where's Michaels?

518
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:03,720
- I'm impressed.
- So am I.

519
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,705
Hey!

520
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:23,573
Why are all these people
looking for my dad?

521
00:35:23,607 --> 00:35:25,109
[Kate]
You'll have to ask him, Paul.

522
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:26,543
There's a river through here.

523
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,083
[tense music playing]

524
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:33,717
[gun beeping]

525
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,832
This is Hut One.

526
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:50,500
We've got a suspicious vehicle
approaching the area.

527
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,837
Requesting permission
to fire at any aggression.

528
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,805
[man on radio] <i>Permission
granted. Fire at will.</i>

529
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:55,873
Roger that.

530
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:11,889
Come on, buddy, make a move.

531
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:25,870
[Kate panting]

532
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:27,504
- Hey!
- What?

533
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:28,605
[bird squawking]

534
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:30,007
I swear, I just heard something.

535
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:42,119
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

536
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:43,586
[Kate yelps]

537
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,557
[indistinct]
It's okay. It's okay.

538
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,360
- [grunts]
- [Paul groans]

539
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:51,561
The charge will neutralize
in a minute.

540
00:36:51,594 --> 00:36:53,064
[Paul] What's...
[indistinct]

541
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:54,497
[Kate]
It's like a taser.

542
00:36:55,598 --> 00:36:57,101
Hang on, I'll be right back.

543
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,235
[Paul] Kate!

544
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:15,886
[groans]

545
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,207
[groans]

546
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:53,791
[grunts]

547
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:56,293
[cracking]

548
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:05,036
[grunting]

549
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:16,781
What is this place?

550
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,693
[gunshot]

551
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,572
Garner said
they'd send transport.

552
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,641
- There must've been an issue.
- [man] Freeze!

553
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,347
Hey! Just take it easy, okay.

554
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,083
Don't fucking move!

555
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:57,922
Boy, you are playing
the wrong way.

556
00:38:57,955 --> 00:38:59,156
Dad?

557
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:02,960
Down on your fucking knees!

558
00:39:02,993 --> 00:39:03,961
Really?

559
00:39:03,994 --> 00:39:05,896
You ready to watch
your boy die, Michaels?

560
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,665
I'm gonna kill these
two motherfuckers right now.

561
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:11,235
Listen, I wouldn't do that.

562
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:14,839
[gunshot]

563
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:25,416
Holy shit, sir!

564
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,484
Excellent shot.

565
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:28,718
Damn, I wish I had
my GoPro rolling.

566
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,354
[Robert]
Thanks for coming in hot.

567
00:39:30,387 --> 00:39:32,622
[man] My pleasure, sir.

568
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,059
- [gasps]
- [chuckles] Cute couple.

569
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:37,128
We... we're not.

570
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:38,362
Mm-hm.

571
00:39:38,395 --> 00:39:40,663
We gotta get our asses moving,
let's go. Come on!

572
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:42,166
[clapping]

573
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:45,635
You okay, Paul?

574
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:47,571
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

575
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:49,073
Yeah, I can see that.

576
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:51,375
Get to the fortress.

577
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:52,843
You coming?

578
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:54,411
Nah, I'm having fun.

579
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:56,113
- My man. [chuckles]
- Seriously?

580
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:58,748
Come on. He knows this land
better than anyone.

581
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:00,750
Except maybe
your girlfriend here.

582
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:03,354
Hang on, folks.

583
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,028
You ready?

584
00:40:11,061 --> 00:40:13,130
You better buckle
your asses up, lovelies,

585
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:17,101
next stop, the fortress!

586
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:19,003
Whoo!

587
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:20,204
Sorry.

588
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:21,338
No worries.

589
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:25,576
[hip hop music playing]

590
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:27,878
Oh, yeah!
About goddamn time

591
00:40:27,912 --> 00:40:30,147
we had some excitement
around here.

592
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:31,081
Shit!

593
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:35,886
I love this track.
I love it! Whoo!

594
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:49,466
Whoo!

595
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,701
Last stop, lovelies.

596
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,703
Thanks for the lift.
You coming with?

597
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:55,239
Nah, I think I'm gonna
go for a little spin.

598
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:56,974
Try to rustle myself up
some more trouble.

599
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:58,542
Be careful, I don't know
who these guys are,

600
00:40:58,576 --> 00:40:59,577
but they're well-trained.

601
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,778
This ain't my first rodeo,
ma'am.

602
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,613
You just take care
of your boyfriend here.

603
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:04,014
Oh, we're not...

604
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:06,917
Ah, right, sure. You're not.
I heard that one.

605
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:13,958
- [Kate] Help me.
- [man] Whoo. Be good.

606
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:15,025
After you.

607
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:37,948
Kate Taylor,
clearance level ten.

608
00:41:43,354 --> 00:41:44,455
[beeps]

609
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,424
Thank you.

610
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:11,415
Welcome to the fortress.

611
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:14,318
The entire space has a
reinforced steel beam framework

612
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:16,253
and 18-inch concrete walls.

613
00:42:16,287 --> 00:42:18,289
It was originally designed
to house up to 100 people

614
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:20,190
for an indeterminate
period of time.

615
00:42:20,224 --> 00:42:22,459
So this is
no retirement retreat.

616
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:23,594
Not exactly.

617
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:25,929
Technically,
I misled you.

618
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:29,800
In the interest of transparency,
I'm in fact not British.

619
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,468
I'm American.

620
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:32,670
Research shows that people

621
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:34,605
find a British accent
more trustworthy.

622
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,006
- Also...
- [chuckles]

623
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,575
...this was originally built as
a secret military compound.

624
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:41,478
Military? Well, that-that
explains all the security,

625
00:42:41,512 --> 00:42:42,680
but why would my father...

626
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:44,048
Nowadays,
it's a place for operatives

627
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:45,349
who've been
compromised in the field.

628
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:47,217
It gives them a chance
to live a semi-normal life

629
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:50,521
when the outside world
becomes no longer safe.

630
00:42:50,554 --> 00:42:51,855
No longer safe?

631
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:53,857
Speaking of safety,
this is the infirmary.

632
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:55,326
Let's get you checked out.

633
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:16,213
Hey, boss, we got two more
bodies over here.

634
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:35,733
Everything looks good.
Are you feeling okay?

635
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:37,735
Yeah.

636
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:40,805
We have a small arms security
attachment here at the facility.

637
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:43,974
And we have an emergency
protocol at Fort Baker,

638
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:46,043
about two hours away
via chopper.

639
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:49,980
So this is all closed-circuit
internal communication?

640
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:51,749
How do you get word
to Fort Baker?

641
00:43:51,783 --> 00:43:54,284
We use an intranet
networking system.

642
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:56,687
Paul, I'd like to introduce you
to our head of operations,

643
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,790
Brigadier General
Barbra T. Dobbs.

644
00:43:58,823 --> 00:43:59,957
Retired, of course.

645
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,024
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

646
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:03,160
Sorry about the disruption
to you visit.

647
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:04,895
But I've known your dad
for a long time.

648
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:06,096
How do you know my dad?

649
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,098
[Sandra]
Uh, General Dobbs,

650
00:44:08,132 --> 00:44:09,600
they're approaching
the hot zone.

651
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:11,535
Garner, team in position.

652
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:12,636
Roger that, General.

653
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:14,271
Let's end this nonsense.

654
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:31,121
Weapons down, weapons down!

655
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:34,826
[coughs]

656
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:35,959
Hold fast, men.

657
00:44:35,993 --> 00:44:37,796
Final warning.

658
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:39,062
Weapons down.

659
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:51,308
Okay.

660
00:44:55,712 --> 00:44:56,980
[Garner] Wait a minute...

661
00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:00,350
Something's not right.

662
00:45:03,654 --> 00:45:05,088
Shit!

663
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:08,025
Fall back, it's an ambush!

664
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:12,162
- Say again.
- <i>It's an ambush!</i>

665
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:14,331
Fall back, fall back,
reach cover! [groans]

666
00:45:14,364 --> 00:45:16,266
[gunfire]

667
00:45:28,745 --> 00:45:30,481
Let's move, people.

668
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,421
[Ulysses] Nice timing, boss.

669
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:39,089
Let's get this done.

670
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,072
[Kate] Who are they?

671
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,174
I have no clue.

672
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:07,651
- It's Fredrick Balzary.
- Dad.

673
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:08,987
That's not possible.

674
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,521
It's him.

675
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:11,956
What does he want?

676
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,323
Me.

677
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:22,466
We've deployed an elite
ex-Delta Force master sergeant

678
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:24,368
to do recon at the section
of the forest

679
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:27,070
we believe to be the origin
of the sniper fire.

680
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:30,307
He will be our ace-in-the-hole to
help us understand what's out there.

681
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:32,609
I'll leave you guys to it.

682
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,245
And what about the ground crew?

683
00:46:37,614 --> 00:46:40,183
We detected seven
on thermal imaging,

684
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:42,553
and we'll see what Sergeant
Blain finds in the forest.

685
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:44,254
Our internet messaging
system is offline.

686
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:45,455
They must be jamming it.

687
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:47,257
We're unable to reach
Fort Baker for support.

688
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:49,660
They wouldn't get here
in time anyway.

689
00:46:49,693 --> 00:46:52,964
We pulled back the main security
force to the auxiliary building

690
00:46:52,997 --> 00:46:54,164
just to our north.

691
00:46:54,197 --> 00:46:55,967
How many left?

692
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,304
Five security guards
and Sergeant Blain.

693
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:02,205
It's like they're sitting ducks
out there.

694
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,975
Let's not underestimate
Sergeant Blain.

695
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:07,444
He's here because he assassinated
a dictator in broad daylight.

696
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:10,113
[Garner] Well, maybe if you
told us who this Balzary is,

697
00:47:10,147 --> 00:47:12,549
we could put
a goddamn plan together.

698
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,819
That's need to know.

699
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:17,554
What I can tell you is
that he's a notorious criminal

700
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:19,389
that we've been
tracking for years.

701
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:22,092
So, what does
he want with Robert?

702
00:47:52,023 --> 00:47:54,424
[tense music playing]

703
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:28,993
No more bullshit, Dad.

704
00:48:29,027 --> 00:48:30,627
Tell me what's going on.

705
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,431
[laughs]

706
00:48:37,135 --> 00:48:39,703
Yeah, I was CIA.

707
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:42,506
For 30 years.

708
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:46,044
Doing what?

709
00:48:46,077 --> 00:48:50,714
I watched financial markets...
in Europe.

710
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:52,784
At least that was my focus.

711
00:48:52,817 --> 00:48:55,019
Uh... are you kidding?

712
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:58,255
My whole life
is global finance.

713
00:48:58,288 --> 00:48:59,924
And that's all you did?

714
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:02,693
Watch the markets?

715
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:05,595
Neutralized it.

716
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:08,498
So today isn't the first time
you've killed people?

717
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:17,108
And all this time I thought you
sold MRI machines to hospitals.

718
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:19,376
I'm sorry I lied.

719
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:24,148
You didn't trust me.

720
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:26,150
Paul, it's the job.

721
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:27,819
I wanted to tell you.

722
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:31,155
Did Mom know?

723
00:49:31,189 --> 00:49:32,622
Of course.

724
00:49:35,993 --> 00:49:38,628
So this place is some kind
of government hideout?

725
00:49:39,663 --> 00:49:42,166
More of a place
for old operatives.

726
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,433
Like me.

727
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:50,975
I wish you woulda just told me.

728
00:49:52,043 --> 00:49:53,677
Instead of disappearing.

729
00:49:54,644 --> 00:49:55,679
Me too.

730
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:02,686
I'm gonna give you a code.

731
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:07,424
I need you to remember it.
Exactly.

732
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,795
It may save your life.

733
00:50:13,396 --> 00:50:15,867
[tense music playing]

734
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:26,210
Echo Two in position.

735
00:50:26,244 --> 00:50:28,445
Locked and loaded, sir.

736
00:50:30,882 --> 00:50:32,349
Clear to fire.

737
00:50:32,984 --> 00:50:34,018
[man] Copy that.

738
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:04,347
Come on, baby.

739
00:51:04,381 --> 00:51:06,449
Alright, there you are.

740
00:51:09,954 --> 00:51:11,388
Come on.

741
00:51:13,891 --> 00:51:16,493
I said fire the fucking weapon,
soldier.

742
00:51:30,473 --> 00:51:32,877
Another bad guy
down for the count, folks.

743
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,980
<i>Looks like I'm ahead,
four-three.</i>

744
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,614
<i>And counting.</i>

745
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:44,588
Blain's taken out
another sniper on the hillside.

746
00:51:44,621 --> 00:51:46,858
Ah, that's great news.
I'm worried about the ground team.

747
00:51:46,891 --> 00:51:47,925
Agree, General.

748
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:50,594
The facility was designed to
temporarily safeguard

749
00:51:50,627 --> 00:51:54,298
against enemy attacks
and natural disasters, but...

750
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:56,399
Balzary's made contact,
General.

751
00:51:58,102 --> 00:51:59,469
Patch him in.

752
00:52:02,472 --> 00:52:06,911
<i>Mr. Balzary, I didn't peg you
for an outdoorsman.</i>

753
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:13,150
It's true, the Riviera
is more suited to my tastes.

754
00:52:13,184 --> 00:52:15,619
And why are you in possession
of one of my radios?

755
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:19,090
Well, I can assure you
that its previous owner

756
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:21,359
has no further use for it,

757
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:25,462
<i>as I stare here
at his dead, rotting corpse.</i>

758
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:29,566
All I can really say is,
it's gross.

759
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:33,070
<i>Enough with the pleasantries.</i>

760
00:52:33,104 --> 00:52:36,107
I have a serious grievance
with you and your government.

761
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,742
It's your government, too,
or did you just forget about

762
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:40,211
<i>your American
birth certificate?</i>

763
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,280
I renounced that alliance
long ago.

764
00:52:42,313 --> 00:52:45,715
<i>I am now a citizen
of the world.</i>

765
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:48,085
You know, I can send you
to our complaints department,

766
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,854
but I'm warning you, Frederick,

767
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:52,056
<i>there's a very long
waiting list.</i>

768
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:56,693
Forgive me, friend, for lightly chuckling
at your attempt at wit, General.

769
00:52:56,726 --> 00:52:58,561
But I'm not
in the laughing mood.

770
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,031
<i>You've stolen</i>

771
00:53:00,064 --> 00:53:01,631
<i>a tremendous amount
of money from my business.</i>

772
00:53:01,665 --> 00:53:03,334
Money that did not belong to me,

773
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:05,169
money that my clients
are holding me

774
00:53:05,202 --> 00:53:06,871
personally responsible for.

775
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:09,206
Alright, that's old news.

776
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,474
Tell that to my wife,

777
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:17,747
being held captive in some Siberian
hell hole while you make snide jokes.

778
00:53:20,151 --> 00:53:25,756
Did you know, General,
that each and every day,

779
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:30,928
that same Russian mob
sends me a new video of my wife.

780
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:32,063
Yes.

781
00:53:32,096 --> 00:53:37,234
And if you were to see just one,
just one single video...

782
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:41,638
I promise you would
not be laughing.

783
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:44,641
Deals with the devil
are tricky that way.

784
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:48,712
<i>Funny, you are
quite the comedian.</i>

785
00:53:51,115 --> 00:53:52,615
Speaking of the devil...

786
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:57,955
can I speak with
my once friend and confidant,

787
00:53:57,989 --> 00:53:59,556
my own personal Judas?

788
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:01,524
Put Robert on.

789
00:54:01,558 --> 00:54:02,793
[Dobbs] <i>Robert's not here.</i>

790
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:04,494
<i>Alright, and the money is gone.</i>

791
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:10,667
Correction, it was gone...

792
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:13,137
<i>until I found it.</i>

793
00:54:19,609 --> 00:54:22,380
Ahh, silence, I love that sound.

794
00:54:22,413 --> 00:54:24,547
That's right, I found it.

795
00:54:24,581 --> 00:54:28,085
All of it, in fact,
still locked away

796
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:30,287
<i>in that little electronic
treasure chest</i>

797
00:54:30,321 --> 00:54:32,356
<i>at the bottom
of the cyber ocean</i>

798
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,993
just waiting.
Just waiting to be opened.

799
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:42,800
<i>You see, that's the nice thing about
money, don't you think, General?</i>

800
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:48,072
It's patient.
Very patient, I love that.

801
00:54:48,105 --> 00:54:51,608
<i>Now, I just need Robert to make like
the little pirate he is and open it.</i>

802
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:54,145
Yeah, that's impossible.

803
00:54:54,178 --> 00:54:57,048
Enough chit-chat, General.

804
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:59,483
You either figure it out
or I'm on my way.

805
00:54:59,517 --> 00:55:01,551
That is not gonna happen.

806
00:55:03,087 --> 00:55:03,988
Oh, it is.

807
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:06,723
I promise you it is.
It is inevitable.

808
00:55:06,757 --> 00:55:10,027
<i>I will be
knocking on your door.</i>

809
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:13,197
The only question
I have for you, General,

810
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,901
<i>as it falls upon your shoulders
if you don't figure this out...</i>

811
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:22,273
how many people must die first?

812
00:55:37,822 --> 00:55:41,025
Dad... what was that all about?

813
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:49,699
I spent six years...
trying to get that bastard.

814
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:53,603
I infiltrated his inner circle.

815
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,811
That's where I was
when your mother was dying.

816
00:56:04,548 --> 00:56:08,452
I told myself
I was doing the right thing.

817
00:56:08,486 --> 00:56:10,687
But it was all for nothing.

818
00:56:11,555 --> 00:56:13,891
No, it wasn't.

819
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,961
[Dobbs] Kate's right.

820
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:20,364
When Robert made his move,

821
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:21,765
it was brilliant.

822
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:27,704
He wiped out
Balzary's working capital.

823
00:56:27,737 --> 00:56:30,407
Six-hundred million
gone with the click of a button.

824
00:56:30,441 --> 00:56:35,312
It disrupted arms deals, drug running,
human trafficking, you name it.

825
00:56:35,346 --> 00:56:39,749
And he gave law enforcement
a moment to catch their breath.

826
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:42,086
It was the pinnacle
of an outstanding career.

827
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:47,224
If he found that money,
my career would be shit.

828
00:56:47,258 --> 00:56:49,260
He wouldn't be here
if he already had it.

829
00:56:49,293 --> 00:56:52,163
He found the shipwreck account,
a virtual treasure chest,

830
00:56:52,196 --> 00:56:56,699
without a key, and he believes that
Robert is the only one that can open it.

831
00:56:59,303 --> 00:57:02,439
It can't be a coincidence they
got here at the same time as me.

832
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:05,708
They must've followed me here.

833
00:57:07,778 --> 00:57:08,812
This is my fault.

834
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:11,115
- It's not your fault, Paul.
- It is.

835
00:57:11,148 --> 00:57:14,919
He would've gotten me.
Sooner or later.

836
00:57:15,718 --> 00:57:17,788
Look, I hate to say it, but...

837
00:57:19,156 --> 00:57:21,792
they gonna probably
use you as leverage.

838
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:23,294
I'm not gonna let that happen.

839
00:57:37,441 --> 00:57:39,243
[tense music playing]

840
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:44,882
[grunting]

841
00:57:54,258 --> 00:57:55,859
[groaning]

842
00:58:01,865 --> 00:58:03,434
[man] Get ready, he's coming.

843
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:09,406
- [gunshots]
- [yelling]

844
00:58:11,008 --> 00:58:12,176
[yells]

845
00:58:31,895 --> 00:58:33,764
[man] It's this way, over here.

846
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,401
Grenade!

847
00:58:38,102 --> 00:58:40,137
[explosion]

848
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,207
Security team neutralized.
All clear.

849
00:58:50,547 --> 00:58:51,915
What's the list for?

850
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,751
Just making sure we know
who to look for

851
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:54,818
when this is all over.

852
00:58:54,852 --> 00:58:57,054
Good call.

853
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:59,923
Though I don't think we're gonna
find too many alive out there.

854
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:03,460
I have to try.

855
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:06,797
[sighs]

856
00:59:08,098 --> 00:59:10,434
You know that path
that leads along the river?

857
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:16,040
If you go into the forest
about 200 meters,

858
00:59:16,073 --> 00:59:18,542
you're gonna come up on
a hidden ammo silo.

859
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,048
Why are you telling me this?

860
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:26,550
Just a hunch.

861
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:33,524
Alright, they need us out there.
Come on, let's go.

862
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:38,962
- [monitor beeping]
- [typing]

863
00:59:49,606 --> 00:59:54,144
Balzary's team has broken
through our final stronghold.

864
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:58,282
That was the last
of our armed guards.

865
00:59:58,315 --> 01:00:01,318
Won't be long until those
mercenaries are knocking on our door.

866
01:00:02,821 --> 01:00:04,221
But we're secure,
right?

867
01:00:04,254 --> 01:00:09,126
[scoffs] The fortress
was build 70 years ago.

868
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:12,096
Explosive devices
have evolved since then.

869
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:15,899
We should prepare
to defend ourselves.

870
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:19,169
[beeping]

871
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:21,840
Why's it gotta be
so damn complicated?

872
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:25,042
Uh, try the button far left.

873
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:26,377
[Paul chuckles softly]

874
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:33,117
Well, I don't know
how I missed that.

875
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,119
Been that kinda day, I guess.

876
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:41,892
How you holding up?

877
01:00:43,193 --> 01:00:44,061
From what?

878
01:00:44,094 --> 01:00:46,196
From almost getting killed
or finding out

879
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,599
my entire childhood
was based on a lie?

880
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:55,939
We haven't spoke
in a long time, you know.

881
01:00:57,809 --> 01:00:59,676
Even after my mom died...

882
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:02,913
neither of us
really put in the effort.

883
01:01:04,948 --> 01:01:07,451
At least now I understand
it wasn't my fault.

884
01:01:09,888 --> 01:01:13,223
People like Robert and I,
we choose this life.

885
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:15,526
And before we realize
the cost to our loved ones,

886
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:19,096
we're in so deep that we can do
nothing but continue to see it through.

887
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:26,670
But I've never met a man more
proud of his family than your dad.

888
01:01:28,372 --> 01:01:30,374
You wanna know
the last time he called me?

889
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:32,342
Three years ago.

890
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:34,445
Tell me about
my mother's funeral.

891
01:01:34,478 --> 01:01:36,713
[footsteps approaching]

892
01:01:36,747 --> 01:01:39,983
Excuse me, General Dobbs,
they need you in the command center.

893
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:42,119
Tell them I'll be right there.

894
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:50,260
Your dad had to sever all ties
with you in order to keep you safe.

895
01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:54,631
With all this going on,
surely you can see why.

896
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,471
But he missed you
every single day.

897
01:02:21,425 --> 01:02:22,559
Miss Garner...

898
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,262
they're here.

899
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:33,437
[tense music playing]

900
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:45,015
Okay. Let's get into position.

901
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:51,355
[beeps]

902
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:04,301
Three, two, one,
fire in the hole!

903
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:21,218
Hello.

904
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,354
Anybody home?

905
01:03:28,258 --> 01:03:31,328
Don't shoot. I'm not armed.

906
01:03:37,134 --> 01:03:38,602
Stay sharp, men.

907
01:03:40,872 --> 01:03:45,509
- Where are your friends, Mr. Michaels?
- The escape hatch.

908
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,647
Escape hatch?

909
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:51,783
Up there.

910
01:03:58,022 --> 01:03:59,523
Put the weapons down.

911
01:03:59,556 --> 01:04:00,858
Slowly.

912
01:04:00,892 --> 01:04:02,559
Gotcha.

913
01:04:05,362 --> 01:04:07,865
[Garner]
Weapons down, soldiers!

914
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,043
Hey, whoa! Don't do it!

915
01:04:19,077 --> 01:04:20,945
- [grunting]
- [Garner] Let him go!

916
01:04:20,979 --> 01:04:22,546
[Dobbs] Sorry, Garner.

917
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:24,181
[groans]

918
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:33,590
[chuckles] Gotcha.

919
01:04:39,262 --> 01:04:42,132
Goddamnit. I hope it's worth it.

920
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:44,769
Save the morality speech.

921
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:52,576
Oh, so much racket.

922
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:55,512
Oh... [chuckles]

923
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:58,415
Robert.

924
01:04:58,448 --> 01:05:01,385
Hello, Robert.
So good to see you.

925
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,424
Is this your son?

926
01:05:08,725 --> 01:05:10,427
Looks just like you.

927
01:05:12,429 --> 01:05:14,197
A little bit more, uh...

928
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:15,532
You know, on top, but...

929
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:20,337
Now, Vlad, is this how
we treat our guests?

930
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:22,639
Let him go.

931
01:05:25,009 --> 01:05:26,309
[grunts]

932
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:34,184
[groans]

933
01:05:40,758 --> 01:05:43,061
What happened to his face?

934
01:05:43,094 --> 01:05:45,262
[Kate] He tried to help you.

935
01:05:45,295 --> 01:05:49,033
I'm sorry about
the nasty look, Robert.

936
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:51,903
But, listen, don't worry,
I made a deal with these gentlemen

937
01:05:51,936 --> 01:05:54,105
that everybody
walks out of here.

938
01:05:54,138 --> 01:05:59,376
Garner's not walking anywhere,
thanks to you.

939
01:06:03,313 --> 01:06:05,282
Stay the hell away from him.

940
01:06:10,822 --> 01:06:12,222
Hm.

941
01:06:12,255 --> 01:06:14,324
Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm.

942
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:17,360
Stay the fuck away!

943
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:19,964
Rise and shine, Paul.

944
01:06:20,998 --> 01:06:23,533
Been one hell of a day, huh?

945
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:26,737
I mean, you must feel like
a fish out of water.

946
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:32,342
Not a trendy sushi joint
or a soy milk latte around.

947
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,311
Stop! Just stop!

948
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,980
It has nothing to do with him.

949
01:06:36,013 --> 01:06:39,150
Oh, but it does, Robert.

950
01:06:39,183 --> 01:06:45,489
The moment you betrayed me,
the moment you stole 600 million,

951
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:50,962
you put Paul here right...
smack dab in the middle.

952
01:06:55,032 --> 01:06:56,333
What?

953
01:06:56,366 --> 01:06:58,702
I keep getting knocked off.

954
01:06:58,735 --> 01:06:59,603
Something's wrong.

955
01:06:59,636 --> 01:07:01,906
[Paul]
The connection's unstable,

956
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:04,441
triggers a security kick.

957
01:07:04,474 --> 01:07:07,178
The system thinks
you're a shitty hacker.

958
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:09,412
And I have a feeling
that's exactly what you are.

959
01:07:11,015 --> 01:07:13,750
[laughing]

960
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:19,456
You are a chip off
the old block, huh?

961
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:24,427
Mm...
so, how do we fix it?

962
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:28,199
You don't try to use a satellite
uplink in native dead space.

963
01:07:28,232 --> 01:07:31,635
Even with that much power linked
to its own orbiting designator.

964
01:07:31,668 --> 01:07:33,570
You'll never get
a strong enough connection.

965
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:37,707
Hm. What's the solution?

966
01:07:39,177 --> 01:07:41,179
A wave rider.

967
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:43,680
A what?
This guy's full of shit.

968
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:46,050
Hm...

969
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:48,920
Ulysses.

970
01:07:49,821 --> 01:07:50,855
Please.

971
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:53,157
[grunts]

972
01:07:53,191 --> 01:07:54,424
[Paul] Leave her alone!

973
01:07:54,457 --> 01:07:56,093
- [Balzary] You have ten seconds...
- Please!

974
01:07:56,127 --> 01:07:57,327
...to start making sense

975
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,063
- You don't have to do that.
- Nine, eight...

976
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:01,498
Just cut me loose
and let me use my own machine.

977
01:08:02,133 --> 01:08:03,801
Please.

978
01:08:04,836 --> 01:08:07,004
- Two...
- It's right here in my bag.

979
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,073
[Balzary] Ah...

980
01:08:09,774 --> 01:08:11,242
I had him.

981
01:08:11,275 --> 01:08:14,578
Vlad, Ulysses,
please watch these two.

982
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:16,981
Sophia... you're up.

983
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:20,318
Let's escort this gentlemen
into the other room.

984
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,352
Show us, Paul.

985
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:27,258
[grunts]

986
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:29,593
You two assholes
stay right where you are.

987
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:40,437
[Balzary] Please,
feel free to take a seat.

988
01:08:46,944 --> 01:08:47,979
Now...

989
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:53,784
please, explain this to me.

990
01:08:53,818 --> 01:08:57,154
Well, like I said,
it's called a wave rider.

991
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:58,823
A prototype I designed.

992
01:08:58,856 --> 01:09:02,592
Instead of going up
to connect to a satellite,

993
01:09:02,626 --> 01:09:07,430
it spreads out to create
its own individualized signal

994
01:09:07,464 --> 01:09:10,634
- from a circuit of regional cell towers.
- No way.

995
01:09:11,369 --> 01:09:12,736
Not out here.

996
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:22,980
This is an offline
closed storage digital wallet.

997
01:09:23,014 --> 01:09:25,850
This isn't a standard
cash account, it's crypto.

998
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:29,653
My dad created this wallet?

999
01:09:31,322 --> 01:09:32,722
Wow.

1000
01:09:34,325 --> 01:09:39,663
From what I know, we just need
the code from your dear old dad.

1001
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:41,531
And we're good to go.

1002
01:09:41,564 --> 01:09:43,466
Well, it's not that easy.

1003
01:09:45,169 --> 01:09:47,104
Hm...

1004
01:09:48,873 --> 01:09:50,908
Careful now.

1005
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:52,777
Just tread lightly.

1006
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:53,911
You see this?

1007
01:09:56,013 --> 01:09:57,915
Damascus steel.

1008
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:00,952
It's really...
it's quite beautiful, don't you think?

1009
01:10:00,985 --> 01:10:02,552
I do.

1010
01:10:02,585 --> 01:10:07,825
You know if I were to, uh,
slit your throat

1011
01:10:07,858 --> 01:10:11,262
you would actually see the blood
spill from your jugular

1012
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:13,496
before you even felt anything.

1013
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:14,932
Okay, oh...

1014
01:10:14,966 --> 01:10:17,168
Can I just say something,
please?

1015
01:10:18,436 --> 01:10:20,171
Don't allow me to interrupt.

1016
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:26,509
You actually need a passkey
to access digital assets.

1017
01:10:26,543 --> 01:10:29,679
But exchanging crypto
for standard fiat cash,

1018
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:32,482
it's not as easy
as a wire transfer.

1019
01:10:32,515 --> 01:10:35,685
It needs to be hosted on
a cryptocurrency exchange.

1020
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:37,855
And the assets sold to buyers.

1021
01:10:37,888 --> 01:10:39,957
But that takes an in-depth
registration process

1022
01:10:39,991 --> 01:10:42,893
and oversight by the exchange's
central authority.

1023
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:47,597
[stutters] It can take months
to find buyers.

1024
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:50,267
Let alone an exchange
that is willing and able

1025
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:51,936
to handle this type of volume.

1026
01:10:54,138 --> 01:11:00,643
Well, I guess it's fortunate that I
just happen to be a chief investor

1027
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:03,114
in a cutting edge
crypto exchange.

1028
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:07,385
Oh, really? Which one?

1029
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:09,954
It's called Invespia.

1030
01:11:11,856 --> 01:11:14,624
- That's my company.
- Hm.

1031
01:11:14,657 --> 01:11:16,827
What the hell you talking about?

1032
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:20,931
WinCo Corporations.
Bluepoint Global.

1033
01:11:21,598 --> 01:11:25,169
Kilney Partners LLC.

1034
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:26,703
Any of these sound familiar?

1035
01:11:26,736 --> 01:11:29,407
Just a couple
of my money market funds

1036
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,276
that happen to dabble in crypto.

1037
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:33,511
That's impossible.

1038
01:11:33,543 --> 01:11:35,645
I've met with
all of those fund managers.

1039
01:11:36,881 --> 01:11:38,983
Well, yes.

1040
01:11:39,016 --> 01:11:42,086
These are legitimate
investment funds.

1041
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:44,789
They just happen to be
under my control.

1042
01:11:44,822 --> 01:11:45,856
Hm.

1043
01:11:47,091 --> 01:11:49,626
But don't worry,
I know what you're thinking.

1044
01:11:52,129 --> 01:11:56,733
I intend to continue
my support of Invespia.

1045
01:11:56,767 --> 01:12:00,438
You see, you are
extremely good at what you do.

1046
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:02,339
Albeit I don't
understand much of it.

1047
01:12:02,373 --> 01:12:04,108
Mm...

1048
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:05,543
But what I do know...

1049
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:11,082
is everything is set up.

1050
01:12:11,115 --> 01:12:16,420
You activate the 600 million
in digital assets

1051
01:12:16,454 --> 01:12:18,255
on the Invespia exchange.

1052
01:12:18,289 --> 01:12:23,160
I already have buyers waiting
to complete the transactions,

1053
01:12:23,194 --> 01:12:26,596
and then you authorize
the cash transfer

1054
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:30,034
from Invespia
to an offshore account.

1055
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:31,102
[scoffs]

1056
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:35,072
So you waited...

1057
01:12:35,106 --> 01:12:39,076
you waited to pull support
from Invespia at the right time,

1058
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:43,247
knowing that I would have no choice
but to contact my father for a loan.

1059
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,747
Paul...

1060
01:12:45,216 --> 01:12:46,517
Pauly...

1061
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:50,054
Think about the future.

1062
01:12:50,087 --> 01:12:51,288
Hm?

1063
01:12:51,322 --> 01:12:53,723
Think about the transaction fees

1064
01:12:53,757 --> 01:12:58,929
Invespia will instantly collect
in a matter... of seconds.

1065
01:12:59,696 --> 01:13:02,900
Your company... your company

1066
01:13:02,933 --> 01:13:05,836
will immediately be
cash positive

1067
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:08,738
and ready for
the next evolution.

1068
01:13:08,772 --> 01:13:10,341
I can see it now.

1069
01:13:10,374 --> 01:13:14,078
You and I will be partners,
and the best part...

1070
01:13:18,048 --> 01:13:22,920
you will walk out of here
in one piece.

1071
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:30,327
Now, enough wasting time.

1072
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:34,431
I need you to convince your
father to give you the passkey.

1073
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:35,766
Hm.

1074
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:39,837
You already did.

1075
01:13:40,604 --> 01:13:42,072
I'm gonna give you a code.

1076
01:13:42,106 --> 01:13:44,909
I need you to remember it.
Exactly.

1077
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:47,244
It may save your life.

1078
01:13:51,649 --> 01:13:53,617
Did he now?

1079
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:54,785
Then what are we doing?

1080
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:56,420
What are we waiting for?

1081
01:14:09,066 --> 01:14:11,302
[typing]

1082
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:24,448
[grunts]

1083
01:14:31,622 --> 01:14:33,057
Okay.

1084
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:36,227
The buyer transactions
have all been finalized.

1085
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,494
Hm.

1086
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:40,097
Now authorize the cash transfer

1087
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:43,400
to the offshore account
and we're done.

1088
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:47,571
I can't. Not for 15 minutes.

1089
01:14:47,605 --> 01:14:49,840
[tsking]

1090
01:14:49,873 --> 01:14:51,942
Don't start a new game

1091
01:14:51,976 --> 01:14:54,778
when you're already winning
the first one, Paul.

1092
01:14:54,812 --> 01:14:58,082
Invespia's bound to a 15-minute
buyer ride over session

1093
01:14:58,115 --> 01:15:01,118
for all asset purchases
before funds can be reallocated.

1094
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,488
Bullshit.

1095
01:15:05,456 --> 01:15:08,759
Find a workaround or I will.

1096
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:11,328
It's embedded in the software.

1097
01:15:11,362 --> 01:15:12,997
Mandatory for compliance.

1098
01:15:18,669 --> 01:15:20,104
In the meantime...

1099
01:15:21,372 --> 01:15:23,407
Kate and my father and I...

1100
01:15:25,142 --> 01:15:26,377
will be leaving.

1101
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:28,879
Uh... how's that?

1102
01:15:30,014 --> 01:15:31,815
We're walking out of here.

1103
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:37,821
When we're safe and sound
I'll authorize the transfer.

1104
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:44,194
Otherwise, the money will be locked
away, again, but without a key.

1105
01:15:44,228 --> 01:15:46,230
[Balzary laughing]

1106
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:09,153
I'll kill him if you don't
authorize the transaction.

1107
01:16:09,186 --> 01:16:10,988
You're gonna
kill us all anyway.

1108
01:16:11,756 --> 01:16:13,657
Not if you cooperate.

1109
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:16,260
- I am a man of my word.
- So am I.

1110
01:16:18,896 --> 01:16:20,331
I know your goons
can track me down

1111
01:16:20,364 --> 01:16:23,100
anytime they want
if I don't follow through.

1112
01:16:23,133 --> 01:16:25,969
I'm committed to make Invespia's
success by any means necessary.

1113
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:28,706
This guarantees the company
has a bright future.

1114
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:29,907
It's a win-win.

1115
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,575
Why would
I throw that a way?

1116
01:16:31,608 --> 01:16:33,010
Hm.

1117
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:36,013
You remind me of me, Paul.

1118
01:16:37,481 --> 01:16:42,419
But Robert Carter Michaels,
he stays with me.

1119
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,521
He pays his debit.

1120
01:16:45,622 --> 01:16:47,558
Non-negotiable.

1121
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:52,262
Ulysses, please escort Paul
and our young lady-friend here

1122
01:16:52,296 --> 01:16:53,897
to the perimeter
of the facility.

1123
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:56,967
Once there, he'll give you
an authorization code.

1124
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,035
Radio it to me.

1125
01:16:58,068 --> 01:16:59,603
And then I'll give you
the go-ahead

1126
01:16:59,636 --> 01:17:00,904
of when to let them go.

1127
01:17:02,573 --> 01:17:04,975
You see?
I am a man of my word.

1128
01:17:08,278 --> 01:17:10,280
I'm not leaving
without my father.

1129
01:17:11,482 --> 01:17:12,950
Paul, just go.

1130
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,057
Go!

1131
01:17:23,927 --> 01:17:25,797
I love you, Dad.

1132
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:27,498
I love you too, son.

1133
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:31,301
Now, go.

1134
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,044
Cute moment.

1135
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:43,614
Zip-tie their hands.

1136
01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:45,182
[tense music playing]

1137
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,941
Slow down.

1138
01:18:13,744 --> 01:18:15,245
[breathes deeply]

1139
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:18,482
Finally,
we're alone at last.

1140
01:18:18,515 --> 01:18:20,017
[exclaims]

1141
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,353
[exhales]

1142
01:18:25,556 --> 01:18:26,623
Comfortable?

1143
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:36,667
Well, it doesn't match your
complexion as nice as mine but...

1144
01:18:39,603 --> 01:18:40,772
it'll do.

1145
01:18:40,805 --> 01:18:43,407
[Robert groaning]

1146
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,415
[laughing]

1147
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,392
I'll fucking teach you.

1148
01:19:02,426 --> 01:19:03,594
That's right.

1149
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:09,500
No one... robs...
from me.

1150
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:20,644
He's gonna kill us
when he gets what he wants.

1151
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:22,379
Get ready to make a move.

1152
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:35,626
Whoo! [laughs]

1153
01:19:37,795 --> 01:19:39,329
Fuck!

1154
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:42,399
Shit!

1155
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,470
Fucking fingers are swelling up.

1156
01:19:49,807 --> 01:19:52,276
You see what you did to me?

1157
01:19:52,309 --> 01:19:54,378
What your fucking face
did to me.

1158
01:19:56,848 --> 01:19:58,282
You keep it up,

1159
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:04,087
I'm gonna make sure
that your death is excruciating.

1160
01:20:05,122 --> 01:20:07,324
You piece of shit.

1161
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:19,169
[grunts]

1162
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:23,106
Frederick, go put that on ice.

1163
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,909
I got this.

1164
01:20:24,943 --> 01:20:26,743
Don't mind if I do.

1165
01:20:27,544 --> 01:20:29,446
You want some ice?

1166
01:20:35,954 --> 01:20:37,187
[chuckles]

1167
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,599
Robert...

1168
01:20:48,632 --> 01:20:50,534
Why would you do this?

1169
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:55,505
You are
the only honest person...

1170
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:57,809
that I knew.

1171
01:21:01,345 --> 01:21:03,413
They left me
down here, Robert.

1172
01:21:04,648 --> 01:21:06,149
[indistinct]

1173
01:21:07,718 --> 01:21:11,823
It's nothing personal.
I can't take it down here anymore.

1174
01:21:11,856 --> 01:21:13,858
I have to see sunshine.

1175
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:20,397
You're undoing everything
that I sacrificed for.

1176
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:25,770
Even my wife's final days.

1177
01:21:27,772 --> 01:21:28,806
For this.

1178
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,413
I'm sorry, I can't...
I can't stay here.

1179
01:21:40,918 --> 01:21:42,185
Interpol is tracking him.

1180
01:21:42,219 --> 01:21:43,387
The minute
he lands in Europe

1181
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:45,489
they're gonna
pick him up, okay.

1182
01:21:45,522 --> 01:21:46,690
Yes.

1183
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:48,860
Of course.

1184
01:21:50,962 --> 01:21:52,964
I'm sorry.

1185
01:21:52,997 --> 01:21:54,364
Be strong.

1186
01:21:56,134 --> 01:21:57,601
Be strong.

1187
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:01,505
Okay.

1188
01:22:12,884 --> 01:22:14,018
[grunts]

1189
01:22:14,052 --> 01:22:15,318
Help!

1190
01:22:16,087 --> 01:22:18,156
Oh, for fuck's sake, get up.

1191
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:20,223
- Help!
- I said get up.

1192
01:22:21,059 --> 01:22:22,726
- [grunts]
- [groans]

1193
01:22:23,828 --> 01:22:25,662
[tense music playing]

1194
01:22:40,277 --> 01:22:42,814
[grunting]

1195
01:23:22,285 --> 01:23:23,988
[yelling]

1196
01:23:40,204 --> 01:23:42,305
[groans]

1197
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:49,180
Now, what were you
and Robert chatting about?

1198
01:23:49,213 --> 01:23:52,349
Just, uh,
reminiscing about old times.

1199
01:23:52,382 --> 01:23:54,417
Mm, reminiscing, huh?

1200
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:58,455
Well, as they say, life can
only be understood backwards,

1201
01:23:58,488 --> 01:24:02,827
but it must be lived forward.

1202
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:05,797
Speaking of which,
the explosives are ready.

1203
01:24:08,632 --> 01:24:12,335
Ulysses, what's the status?

1204
01:24:12,369 --> 01:24:15,973
Does no one answer
these fucking walkies but me?

1205
01:24:16,007 --> 01:24:17,574
Ulysses, do you copy?

1206
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:19,409
Frederick, a word please.

1207
01:24:20,912 --> 01:24:21,979
Go find them.

1208
01:24:22,013 --> 01:24:23,815
No one leaves this mountain.

1209
01:24:23,848 --> 01:24:25,850
Copy that.

1210
01:24:25,883 --> 01:24:27,751
Why are you releasing
your rottweilers?

1211
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:30,687
I mean, we had a deal,
Kate and Paul walk.

1212
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:34,658
Well, I guess we both made a few
independent decisions now, haven't we?

1213
01:24:34,691 --> 01:24:37,427
- What are you talking about?
- You truly underestimated

1214
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,429
my relationships in Europe,
now didn't you?

1215
01:24:39,462 --> 01:24:43,868
And you forgot one very
important thing.

1216
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:45,002
What's that?

1217
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:48,206
Nobody trusts Americans.

1218
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,775
- [gasps]
- [grunts]

1219
01:24:51,843 --> 01:24:52,910
Oh, yeah.

1220
01:24:52,944 --> 01:24:54,846
- [inhales]
- [whimpers]

1221
01:24:58,115 --> 01:24:59,984
It's kinda sexy, isn't it?

1222
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:04,754
In like a "holy shit,
I'm dying," kinda way.

1223
01:25:10,828 --> 01:25:12,129
Shit.

1224
01:25:17,601 --> 01:25:19,669
Drag her body out of here.

1225
01:25:20,938 --> 01:25:22,073
You have a towel?

1226
01:25:25,243 --> 01:25:28,212
She really was
getting under my skin.

1227
01:25:28,246 --> 01:25:30,781
Alright, close to time.

1228
01:25:30,815 --> 01:25:33,184
Keep an eye on the charges,
keep an eye on the computer.

1229
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:34,852
Roger that, boss.

1230
01:25:38,089 --> 01:25:39,689
I shoulda killed you.

1231
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:44,394
Yeah, shoulda, woulda,
coulda, didn't.

1232
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:48,065
Well, if it's any comfort,

1233
01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:51,135
you'll be joining your boy,
Paul, in the afterlife.

1234
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:54,138
Sooner rather than later.

1235
01:25:54,171 --> 01:25:56,841
Whole family together.

1236
01:25:56,874 --> 01:25:59,877
Sounds like
a happy ending to me. Yes?

1237
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:03,680
Any last words?

1238
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,451
Actually, yes.

1239
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:17,128
