00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,115
L-Is this-

511
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,679
I want to speak to a Mr. Victor.

512
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,918
I'm calling from Largo.

513
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,187
We could sign on to a charter.

514
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,923
That's what you and Dad
were gonna do.

515
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,192
I'll crew, you cook.

516
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,930
- Why? It's pretty here.
- Mom, it's next to a bar.

517
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,570
<i>- True.
- Come on.</i>

518
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,179
The Mediterranean, huh?

519
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,476
The Turkish coast?

520
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,778
- It's great fishing there.
- [Laughs]

521
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,081
Okay. Freedom.

522
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,852
[Laughs]

523
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,622
It's obvious she love you.

524
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,996
What is that, some kind of Latin concept?
Kill the one you love?

525
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,537
Well, I could do the same to keep you.

526
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,573
- You don't say.
- Uh-huh.

527
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,336
Then my cousins would come...

528
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:57,004
put you on a spit
and roast you like a pig.

529
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,880
Do me a favor.
Don't love me.

530
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,817
[Giggles]

531
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,682
You, uh-

532
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,282
You okay for cash
while I'm gone?

533
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,530
Alex, I thought
I was coming with you.

534
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,863
You are, when I get back.

535
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,437
This is just a couple of days.

536
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,564
Dull, boring days.

537
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,375
Hey!
Thanks, boss.

538
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,751
Hi.

539
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:48,289
<i>[Gabriela]
Voy! Voy! Ya vengo!</i>

540
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,962
What are you doing here?

541
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,402
Came to see the cats.

542
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:02,606
- Well, I am moving soon anyway.
- Moving? Where?

543
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,173
Uh-

544
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,784
With who?

545
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,119
Someone I care about.

546
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,624
Good.

547
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,298
Are you happy?

548
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,335
Yeah.

549
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,905
You don't look so happy.

550
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:39,512
Well, I guess you are going to
have to take my word for it.

551
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:42,752
Yeah, I guess so.

552
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,754
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

553
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:48,154
<i>Bueno.</i>

554
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,256
You can reach me there for a while.

555
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,495
Take care of yourself.

556
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,870
Yeah. You too.
