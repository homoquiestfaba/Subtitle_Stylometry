Amsterdam, Warsaw, and from Paris.

The French are hiding it, the
Germans are finding and taking it.

can, to the city of Aachen.

344
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,973
We'll leave in the morning.

345
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,510
Why don't you take Sam
from Newark with you,

346
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,976
and I'll head up to my old
stomping ground, Bruges?

347
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,604
There's a <i>Madonna</i> there I
used to see when I was young.

348
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,691
Looks like we're gonna
be together, buddy.

349
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,444
These are German,
but they might fit.

350
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,159
That one will do just fine.

351
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,244
Watch this.

352
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,914
Any news of Granger?

353
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:30,504
Well, word is they liberated Paris,
so we should know something soon.

354
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,672
Turn that knob right there.

00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,762
- Well, I'll be blowed.
- See, I'm not just a pretty face.

357
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,180
How's it going, Edison?

358
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,974
Would you take that radio
over there to the boys?

359
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,859
- Let's see if this damn thing works.
- You bet.

360
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,446
Frank, I wanted to say thanks.

361
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,493
For what?

362
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,321
For another chance.

363
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,245
Donnie, we've all screwed
up on some level.

364
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,376
Yours was just...

365
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,878
Just at a high level.

366
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,922
You're here because you're
the best man for the job.

367
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,754
Not charity?

368
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,552
Well, a little.

00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,578

This mission was never
designed to succeed.

381
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,415
It's, uh...

382
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,633
If they were honest,
they would tell us that.

00:28:55,984 --> 00:29:00,009
<i>They'd tell us that with this many
people dying, who cares about art?</i>

385
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,892
They're wrong, because that's
exactly what we're fighting for,

386
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:08,101
for our culture and
for our way of life.

387
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,272
You can wipe out a
generation of people,

388
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,735
you can burn their homes to the ground,
and somehow they'll still come back.

389
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:22,157
But if you destroy their
achievements and their history,

390
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,205
then it's like they never existed.

391
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,701
Just ash floating.

394
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,177
I'll see you in the morning.

395
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,306
Now I'm depressed.

396
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,276
I want to make a toast.

397
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,812
Uh-oh.

398
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,823

And I'm proud to be
a Monuments Man.

401
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:16,124
When this all broke out, I wanted to
be a flier pilot... A fighter pilot.

402
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,968
But I got bad eyes,
my hearing is not good.

403
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,548
Right here is the only
way I get into this war.

404
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,514
Now, I'm not some
New York socialite,

405
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,601
I haven't won any awards
like all of you, but...

406
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,858
But I'm guessing you feel the same.

407
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,944
This is our time.

408
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,406
My country thanks you,
and I thank you.

409
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,158
Screw the Germans.

410
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,361
Present company expected.

411
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,496
To the Monuments Men.

412
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,209
- To the Monuments.
- To the Monuments Men.

415
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,840
- Boy and girl?
- Two girls.

00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,380
- Two girls, hmm.
- Heh-heh, I know.

417
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,760
I know.

418
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,550
I have a boy.

419
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,179
A 17-year-old boy. He's, uh...

420
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,191
He's with the Resistance
up in the north.

421
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,646
In the north?

422
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,484
- Yeah.
- Rough up there.

423
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,398
Yeah, it's rough.

424
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,329
Hard times.

425
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,538
Yeah, hard times.

Am I late?

431
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,555
- By about four years.
- Ha-ha-ha.

432
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,974
- How are you, James?
- Hello, René.

433
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,313
How much of the art did you save?

434
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,228
The national collection is safe.

435
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,399
But the private collections,
they are all gone.

436
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,317
All the private collectors?

437
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,579
All the private Jewish collectors,
by decree, are illegitimate.

438
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,865
Goering used this place to shop.

439
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,325
And take them where?

440
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,086
Germany. To their homes.

441
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,497
Well, René,

442
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,339
the U.S. Army would like
to help you get them back.

00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,090
I'm happy to hear you say that.

446
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,116
Claire Simone?

447
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:43,497
(IN FRENCH)
Hoping was I to speak about art...

448
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,091
the stolen art.

449
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,252
(IN FRENCH) Yeah?

450
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:58,225
I'd like to forcefully introduce
myself. I am James Granger...

451
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:03,525
and I'm the curator of
Medieval art at the Met...

452
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,730
(IN ENGLISH) New York.

453
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,486
I know who you are.

454
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:11,242
(IN FRENCH)
Then you know I'd like to help.

455
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,867
I know nothing.

456
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,412
(IN ENGLISH) And will you
stop speaking in French?

457
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,948
Or whatever language
you are speaking.

458
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,286
(IN ENGLISH) Well, if it weren't
for us, you'd be speaking German.

459
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:28,001
No. If it wasn't for
you, I might be dead.

460
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,794
But I would still
be speaking French.

461
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,924
- Okay.
- So,

462
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,558
- how can I help you steal our stolen art?
- That's not why I'm here.

463
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,350
- I'm here to help you get it back.
- Yes, to fill your museum.

464
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,521
I'm told you were at the Jeu de
Paume during the occupation.

465
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,775
- I was.
- I'm interested in what you saw there.

466
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:57,537
Goering came more than 20 times,
you know, took whatever he wanted.

467
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,039
Where did they take them?

468
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,746
- Who knows?
- I think you do know.

469
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,955
Ah.

470
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,791
You've been speaking with Rene.

471
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,997
Were you there the whole time?

472
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,588
Of course. I'm a collaborator.
Haven't you heard?

473
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,720
I helped the Germans steal our art.

474
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,596
And that's why you're here?

475
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,762
What do you think?

476
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,347
I think you worked
with the Resistance.

477
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,979
And I think I can convince
them to let you out.

478
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,810
Why?

479
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,226
Do you know where
the art was taken?

480
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,612
Who's asking?
The curator of the Met?

481
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,444
(♪♪)

482
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,322
We put all of the panels in a
truck, sent it to Brussels

483
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,742
with two priests. But the Germans
found them and took them.

484
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,626
May I speak to the priests?

485
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,913
They were shot.

486
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:56,051
If we're gonna find it, we'll have to jump
ahead of the Third Army into Germany.

STOKES: Number one priority, Preston.
You understand?

488
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,971
The Nazis can't keep it.

<i>It says the Altarpiece</i>

493
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,488
is one of the most
desired pieces of art.

494
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,648
How'd you read all that?

495
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,868
- It's in English.
- Yeah, I know that.

496
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,655
I just wasn't actually
aware you could read.

497
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,921
MAN: Psst!

498
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,506
Easy.

499
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,594
So, Sam, when did
you leave Germany?

500
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,186
1938. Yeah, I was 13.

501
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,067
- Did your family go with you?
- Yeah, my parents.

502
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,274
My grandfather stayed behind.

503
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,565
- What city?
- Karlsruhe.

504
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,530
Yeah, you know, there's
a famous museum there.

505
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,070
Had one of Rembrandt's
self-portraits.

506
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,036
See? You were born to
be a Monuments Man.

507
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,452
- I've never seen that painting.
- No, me neither.

508
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,454
We weren't allowed.

509
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,500
My grandfather would tell me it
was because we were too short.

510
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,386
And then war broke out,

511
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,886
and all of Europe was
too short for Hitler.

512
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,137
(♪♪)

513
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,643
Have you heard from
your grandfather?

514
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,850
No, not for four years.

515
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,565

Yes, sir, two men. A Frenchman
named Jean-Claude Clermont

1381
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,855
(MAN SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

1382
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,939
(♪♪)

1383
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:13,105
<i>STOKES:
And a Brit named Donald Jeffries,</i>

1384
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:16,367
who lost his life saving the
Bruges Madonna and Child.

1385
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:19,324
TRUMAN: Lieutenant Stokes,
I have one question.

1386
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:22,239
- You said the <i>Madonna.</i>
- Yes, sir, the Bruges Madonna.

1387
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:25,285
- TRUMAN: Michelangelo made it, right?
- Yes, sir.

1388
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:29,045
- And you lost a man trying to save it.
- Donald Jeffries.

1389
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:32,299
You think it was worth
it, for a piece of art?

1390
01:49:33,275 --> 01:49:37,346
Do you think Jeffries would say it
was worth it, if he could speak?

1391
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:40,261
If he could speak...

1392
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:45,513
I think he would.

1393
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:49,016
TRUMAN: All right then, how
about you, lieutenant?

1394
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:52,562
<i>You were in charge, and this
gets to the heart of the matter.</i>

1395
01:49:52,628 --> 01:49:55,072
<i>Do you think 30 years from now,</i>

1396
01:49:55,130 --> 01:50:00,828
<i>anyone's going to remember that
these men died for a piece of art?</i>

1397
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:04,406
(♪♪)

1398
01:50:13,398 --> 01:50:14,920
Yeah.

1399
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,933
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1400
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:31,104
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
