1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:03,749
<i>Tonight, we'll go behind the walls.</i>

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,221
I'm going into the walls tonight.

3
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:07,123
<i>Dig beneath the lies.</i>

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,699
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,669
The evidence says you did.

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,830
<i>And the treachery.</i>

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,700
You tell me now.

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,919
Not gonna happen, John.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,610
<i>All to uncover the facts and secrets</i>

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,920
<i>behind TV's most exciting new show.</i>

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,414
I'm getting you out of here.

12
00:00:23,437 --> 00:00:26,007
<i>From a man who will go to any length</i>

13
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,080
5 years at Fox River State Penitentiary.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,300
<i>To save a brother about to die
for a crime he may not have committed.</i>

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,780
<i>To the brutality and violence of one
of the world's most notorious prisons.</i>

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,160
<i>From a mysterious trail
of cover-ups and muggers</i>

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,099
Move on the younger brother before
anything bites any of us in the ass.

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,780
<i>To a sinister plot that reaches
to the highest levels</i>

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,262
<i>and darkest corners
of the US government.</i>

20
00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:59,170
The man killed
the Vice-President's brother.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,080
<i>All tonight, as we present</i>

22
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,020
May 11th, that's the day, pal.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,230
That's the day they...
you know... execute me.

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,021
I know.

25
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,967
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

26
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,800
The evidence says you did.

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,570
I don't care what the evidence says.
I didn't kill him.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,560
Swear to me.

29
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,220
I swear to you, Michael.

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,140
<i>I play a man whose older brother
is on death row</i>

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,780
<i>framed for a crime that he may
or may not have committed.</i>

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
What is it about this case

33
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,030
that the Secret Services
are so interested in?

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,610
The man killed
the Vice-President's brother.

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,560
<i>I've exhausted all legal options
trying to clear his name.</i>

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,510
<i>So I decide to take matters
into my own hands.</i>

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>The character that I'm playing
is a structural engineer</i>

38
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,750
and I've got this brilliant
detailed plan

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,230
<i>that covers everything
from certain individuals' backgrounds</i>

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,540
<i>in the prison itself,</i>

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,450
<i>the warden of the prison,
the mob boss inside</i>

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,760
<i>the guy who is running
the black market.</i>

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,091
Open it.

44
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:22,140
I hold up a bank...

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,870
Put down your weapon!

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,891
<i>...in order to get thrown
into the same prison</i>

47
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:31,230
<i>where he's being held
so I can help him escape.</i>

48
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,922
I've known you my entire life.

49
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,950
You don't have a violent bone
in your body.

50
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,611
<i>I play Veronica Donovan.
I'm an attorney.</i>

51
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:39,632
And Michael calls on me
to represent him

52
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:42,160
basically because he wants
to get thrown in jail.

53
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,580
I'm not a criminal attorney.
I'm like a real estate attorney.

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,560
It's a kind I've no idea what I'm doing
and I'm completely in over my head.

55
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,550
Rarely in a case of armed robbery
do we hear a plea of no contest.

56
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,820
Are you sure of this Mr. Scofield?

57
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm sure Your Honor.

58
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,061
Your Honor,
we'd like to recess if we could,

59
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:59,040
my client's a bit confused
at the moment.

60
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,820
- I'm not your Honor.
- He is your Honor.

61
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,920
I guarantee him being thrown in jail.

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,548
You discharged a deadly weapon

63
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,670
during the commission of the crime
suggests malice to me.

64
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,258
The closest level 1 facility
would be Fox River State Penitenciary.

65
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,310
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

66
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,310
Michael?

67
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,810
Why?

68
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,230
I'm getting you out of here.

69
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,970
It's impossible.

70
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,400
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

71
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,540
It's a thriller but it's also
a family... drama.

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,780
The show explores
the extremities of love

73
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,250
and what some people are willing to do
in order to save a loved one's life.

74
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,630
My brother and I have a very complicated
relationship where he... has...

75
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,215
taken care of me from an early age

76
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:54,650
when both of our parents
were no longer on the scene.

77
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,850
- It's not gonna be the same.
- Oh we're gonna figure it out.

78
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,230
And no matter what,

79
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,060
It's still gonna be me and you.

80
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,980
Okay, but...

81
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,830
What if something happens to you?

82
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,370
You just... have a little faith.

83
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,117
Made a lot of sacrifices so that

84
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:12,730
I would not have to suffer
the way that he did,

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,190
His life took a couple of wrong turns.

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,570
Lincoln was the kind of guy
that chose the wrong side of life,

87
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,670
but made sure that Michael
didn't follow in his footsteps.

88
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,870
I went off to college and grand school,

89
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:27,720
enjoyed the degree of success
that he never knew,

90
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,770
so when he goes to prison,

91
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,020
I really feel as I owe him,

92
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,430
for having made all these sacrifices,

93
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,090
and now I can use all of

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,870
the expertise I've gotten

95
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:41,230
as a structural engineer
in order to save him.

96
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,400
You know, I've made my peace
with what is coming

97
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,389
and you show up and
give me the one thing

98
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,170
a man in my situation shouldn't have:

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,930
Hope.

100
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,850
Just have a little faith.

101
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,910
I've got the most meticulous plan
you can imagine.

102
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,740
<i>I've done extensive researches as far as
across the layout of the prison</i>

103
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,280
what screws they use,
what bolts they use.

104
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,332
Getting outside these walls
is just the beginning.

105
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,580
We gonna need money.

106
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,970
I'll have it.

107
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,100
And people in the outside.

108
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,370
People that can help you disappear.

109
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,950
I've already got them.

110
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,620
They just don't know it yet.

111
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,870
Michael has gone about

112
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,430
making contact with all his inmates

113
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,100
in the prison, because every inmate

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,690
is serving a function

115
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,540
for the break, once they do breakout

116
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,450
so he needs everyone of these guys
to make this thing happen.

117
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,420
The very cool twist,

118
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,860
is that I have the blueprints
to this prison

119
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,700
hidden in a tattoo that covers
my entire upper body and arms.

120
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,010
- You've seen the blueprints?
- Better than that.

121
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,390
I've got them on me.

122
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,360
Am I supposed to be
seeing something here?

123
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,950
When I first saw the tattoo,
my question was: "Well...

124
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,469
where are the blueprints?", because
they're not visible to the naked eye.

125
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,430
Look closer.

126
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,430
They are woven into the artwork itself.

127
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,060
They said there was gonna be
a prison map, hidden

128
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,200
within a tattoo.

129
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,310
The Art Department e-mailed me a map,

130
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,530
and I took the map,

131
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,640
threw it over onto a light table,

132
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,400
threw a piece of vellum on top of that,

133
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,210
then just incorporated some cracks

134
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,290
and contour lines and stuff like that.

135
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,110
I knew they were in these visual effects

136
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,270
but I wanted it to be there

137
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,320
as much as possible.

138
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,480
Now the front

139
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,540
contains all the underground
passageways.

140
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,020
The back is the

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
overview shot like it's from
helicopter point of view

142
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,360
of the actual prison.

143
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,330
It's not just drawings but there are

144
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,634
words written backwards and upside down,

145
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:58,387
various symbols that mean
certain things and references to

146
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:01,210
people, to street names

147
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,910
to chemical formulas, and a lot of it

148
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,288
only I can see when I hold up a mirror

149
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,130
so I can read the writing
in the correct way.

150
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,540
As the episodes come about,
they called me up

151
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,730
and told me: "Okay,"

152
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,980
"we need this specific design,
we need it to say this..."

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,510
They're constantly being

154
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,568
procreative on thinking up
different ways

155
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:21,900
to incorporate the tattooer.

156
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,450
I've only had the entire tattoo on once,
so far.

157
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,960
Kind of like 30 decals
that they put together like...

158
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,970
pieces of puzzle.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,230
It's 2 or 3 pieces for each arm,

160
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,780
and a back and a front in one piece,

161
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,950
and there's some top of the shoulders

162
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,730
and... there is the rib cage
that has a several pieces.

163
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,800
That's impressive.

164
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,420
I have no idea what most of that stuff
actually signifies.

165
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,990
But the writers have

166
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,810
this entire series planned out
through the second season,

167
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,770
so each episode is a surprise.

168
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,920
<i>When we return, you'll come face to face
with the villains of Prison Break.</i>

169
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,810
Three!

170
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,790
How's the foot?

171
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,230
<i>And the men who will play a key role
in the escape.</i>

172
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,250
See these hands?
They're digging machines.

173
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:10,890
Are you going to China,
I'll get you there!

174
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,130
<i>Plus, we'll uncover the conspiracy</i>

175
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,960
<i>that put an innocent man behind bars.</i>

176
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,720
Anyone that's a threat
to what we're doing is expendable.

177
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,480
<i>All when Prison Break Behind the Walls
returns.</i>

178
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,257
<i>No one's ever broken out Fox River.</i>

179
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:32,240
<i>Underscene steps
have already been mapped out.</i>

180
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,080
- Every contengency.
- Every contengency!

181
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,110
You may have the blueprints
of this place

182
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,459
but there's one thing those plans
can't show you: people.

183
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,570
As soon as you look at these cats
the wrong way, they'll cut you off.

184
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,070
All every good story needs a...
a villain.

185
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,910
Or in our case, many villains.

186
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,390
And we have villains that you hate,

187
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,240
and villains that you love to hate.

188
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,870
Wrong piece of real estate, Fish.

189
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,220
It belongs to T-Bag.

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,140
Who?

191
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,320
You best pick a respect, Fish.

192
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,070
Man kidnapped half dozen
boys and girls down in Belmer.

193
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,400
Raped them, killed them.

194
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,330
Wasn't always in that order either.

195
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,690
Does T-Bag has a real name?

196
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,120
That is my real name.

197
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,830
No, no, no, please.

198
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,670
Sit.

199
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,180
So you're the new one I've been hearing
all of River Views about?

200
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,420
Scofield.

201
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,829
What I loved about T-Bag

202
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,440
was that on paper, he was saying things
that are very menacing and dangerous.

203
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,020
And, obviously,
he's a leader of the pack.

204
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,540
- Ragheads got you scared, do they?
- Sorry?

205
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,689
Assume that's why you're over here.

206
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,330
Few days on the inside,

207
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,910
any God-fearing white man realizes

208
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,119
the correctional system's
got a serious lean

209
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,570
towards the African-American persuasion.

210
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,600
I hadn't noticed.

211
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,600
But, I wanted to...

212
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,620
try to make it charming... and sweet.

213
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,160
"You have to do
what I want you to do", but...

214
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,390
it was also a very protective
kind of thing.

215
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,030
We'll protect you. I'll protect you.

216
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,670
All you gotta do is...

217
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,900
take this pocket right here,

218
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,200
and your life'll be
all peaches and cream.

219
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,100
Looks to me you already got
a girlfriend.

220
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,000
I got a whole another pocket
over here.

221
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,900
Well, I'll pass.

222
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,700
Then you best move then.

223
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,590
Now.

224
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,410
T- Bag is a huge conflict for Michael.

225
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,520
The great thing about T-Bag

226
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,210
is that he is always in his face
saying: Hey!

227
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,050
First I want you...

228
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay, you don't want me?

229
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,940
I'm gonna make your life miserable,

230
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,450
and by making your life miserable,

231
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,630
I'm gonna mess up your plans,
whatever they are.

232
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,590
Got an issue with our little friend
over there?

233
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,740
Don't gotta come to you,
you don't give the green light.

234
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,650
Everythin' in here runs through me,
you know that?

235
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,760
My name is John Abruzzi,

236
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,460
and I'm a mobster, I'm a hitman.

237
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,900
I'm not a Don.

238
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,120
But for my family,
I took the dive to go to prison.

239
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,000
Say you were able
to get outside those walls...

240
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,730
Would you have the people in place
to make sure you disappeared forever?

241
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,330
Why do you care?

242
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,290
Just curious.

243
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,150
What I say to Abruzzi is:

244
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,150
"I've discovered the man who"

245
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,030
"pointed the finger at you
and put you behind bars."

246
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,959
This individual who is off
on witness protection somewhere,

247
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,780
I found out where he is.

248
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,489
Word is there's someone in here

249
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,520
who knows where Fibonacci is,
and you're not doing anything about it.

250
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,349
I'm working on it.

251
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,060
Well, you're not working on it
fast enough.

252
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,330
Apparently, Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

253
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,000
Next month, a congressional hearing.

254
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,330
Now, if he testifies in that hearing,

255
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,440
a lot of people are going down.

256
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,530
Including me.

257
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
And I've known you a long time,

258
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,860
our wives are friends,
our kids go to the same catholic school.

259
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,770
Now, it would be a shame,

260
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,490
if anything would happen to your kids.

261
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,730
One of my

262
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,970
mobster friends

263
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,960
has my two kids
and he's gonna hurt the kids if I don't

264
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,240
follow his new rules.

265
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,600
Abruzzi decides to break me

266
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,990
and simply get the information out of me
by force.

267
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,640
Now I'm gonna count to 3.

268
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,590
- One...
- I give you that information,

269
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,570
I'm a dead man.

270
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,010
You know it, and I know it.

271
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,980
Two.

272
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,007
I'll tell you the name
from outside those walls,

273
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,030
not a second before.

274
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,500
You tell me now!

275
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,280
Not gonna happen, John.

276
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,150
Three!

277
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,950
I call it "Sicilian pedicure."

278
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,720
We do that in Sicily all the time.

279
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,950
- I'm gonna kill that scum!
- You won't!

280
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,310
You kill him, you kill our express
to get out of here.

281
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,460
Look what he did to you.

282
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,271
You're not gonna last
a second in this place

283
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:49,530
unless I do something about it.

284
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,210
You ever hear of Top-Flight Charters?

285
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,590
Yeah.

286
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,030
They're run by a shell corporation
Abruzzi owns.

287
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,413
We get him on board,
there's gonna be a midnight flight

288
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,460
waiting for us the night
we get outside those walls.

289
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,120
It's important to remember
that he's not

290
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,100
a super hero.
He doesn't have martial art skills and

291
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,860
when he goes behind bars
to save his brother,

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,990
...he's very much in jeopardy.

293
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,410
24/7.

294
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,720
How's the foot?

295
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,620
Officer Bellick.

296
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,160
He's in charge of the prisoners,

297
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,350
the guards,

298
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,620
he knows everything.

299
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,920
So he kind of...

300
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,270
in a strange way, kind of underhandedly

301
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,820
runs the show.

302
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,553
You're talking out of the side
of your neck.

303
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,030
Just trying to fly low
over the radar, boss.

304
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,590
There isn't any flying under my radar.

305
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,500
Bellick's first impression with Michael,

306
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,210
is that he is... cocky upstart.

307
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,170
And Bellick enjoys

308
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,330
people like that 'cause
he loves to mess with them.

309
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,720
Under the table, cohoño!

310
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,650
What the hell is this?

311
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,080
It's insurance, white boy!

312
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,770
Now dump it!

313
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,250
So... Tooling up for the race riot,
aren't we?

314
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,700
I try to find out

315
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,620
what Michael's up to.
He's up to something.

316
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,020
This guy shouldn't be in here.

317
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,900
So I think that's

318
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,230
a quandary for Bellick
that he enjoys, you know,

319
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,330
trying to put that puzzle together.

320
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,500
I'm telling you the guards are
the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

321
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,680
The only difference between us and them,

322
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,820
it's the badge.

323
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,490
There are a number of characters

324
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,070
that he encounters in prison

325
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,210
who he probably would not choose
to engage with

326
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,130
on the outside

327
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,350
because he would look at them
as convicts,

328
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,470
people who'd committed

329
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,760
...crimes,

330
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,380
but what he comes to understand is that

331
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,520
they are good people.

332
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,600
They may have made certain mistakes,

333
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,730
but they do still have value and worth,

334
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,240
not only to Michael's plan as a whole

335
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,750
but to his development as...
a man, as a person.

336
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,280
Sucre?

337
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,440
You can't be serious.

338
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,660
The guy's a thief Michael,
he can't be trusted.

339
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,130
Gonna have to trust him,
because he's my cellmate.

340
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:59,399
We don't hire him, there won't be
any digging in that cell.

341
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,010
And if there's no digging
in that cell...

342
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,440
then there's no escape.

343
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,500
Fernando Sucre is an amazing character.

344
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,410
One of the things I love about him,

345
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,690
he's not just a thug.

346
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,260
I'm not saying he's a good guy, but

347
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,650
he's got a good side,
he... he loves his girl,

348
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,220
What's another word for love?

349
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,450
What's the context?

350
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,010
Oh you know...

351
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,504
The "l love you so much,
I'm never knocking over

352
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,070
a liquor store again" context.

353
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,470
Except, you know, classy.

354
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,240
He's got a girlfriend on the outside,
Marie-Cruz, with whom he's in love,

355
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,600
Marie-Cruz has

356
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,580
another suitor who's actually
Sucre's cousin,

357
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,410
so there's another man on the scene.

358
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,660
What are you doing here?
Where's Marie-Cruz?

359
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,920
She's not gonna come around here
any more.

360
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,070
Is she hurt?

361
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,600
Oh no no, she's fine, she's fine.
She's just...

362
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,140
She's with me now.

363
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,670
Sucre feels threatened,

364
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,240
and wants to get in on the plan,
simply to

365
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,030
get out so he can stop the wedding.

366
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,830
I want back in.

367
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,310
- Too late.
- I'll do what you want.

368
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,280
See these hands?

369
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,290
They're digging machine.

370
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,970
Are you going to China,
I'll get you there!

371
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,320
I'll dig like a psychotic rodent
if I have to...

372
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:06,820
Fish!

373
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,230
I gotta be back in.

374
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,190
Fernando/Michael...

375
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,950
how awesome these two guys.

376
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,029
They think differently,

377
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,100
they're brought up differently
and somehow,

378
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,720
their chemistry just sparks
this thing that

379
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,870
makes it placid to watch.

380
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,260
- Good to be back, mate!
- Good to have you back.

381
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,690
So...

382
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,670
When do we get started?

383
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,870
They have their own

384
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,580
agenda, but they care each other
and they...

385
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,200
and they support each other.

386
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,720
Is this yours?

387
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,890
You're not a good liar.

388
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,420
Come on, Sucre, you go to the SHU.

389
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,589
Move along, Deputy.

390
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm not done checking the cell,
down here.

391
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,370
I said move along.

392
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,820
Prison wardens are usually very tough,
hard nosed,

393
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,160
preachers who have been moulded
that way by the...

394
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,990
by the prison system.

395
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,340
He's not your...

396
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,010
traditional expected warden bad-ass type

397
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,610
but instead, a warm...
paternal figure.

398
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,910
I can't help wondering what someone
with your credentials

399
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,450
is doing in a place like this?

400
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,260
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

401
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,580
You make it sound
like a trafic infraction.

402
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,480
Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one way street.

403
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,590
Everyone turns up once sooner or later.

404
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,870
Almost 21 years ago,

405
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,420
I did little time myself in England.

406
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,210
And the warden, or the governor,
they call him there,

407
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,600
his all philosophy about...
prison and prisoners,

408
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,830
was very similar
to Henry Pops' in that he's...

409
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,020
he believed in rehabilitation.

410
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,920
I know you're a structural engineer,
Scofield.

411
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,670
Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a

412
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,540
monument to his undying love
for his wife.

413
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,950
My wife is quite fan of the story.

414
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,430
It appeals to the romantic in her.

415
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
What's odd? This is truly unique

416
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,630
to discover that he has a wife
for forty years, and...

417
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,340
well, he loves her,
wants to do something for her.

418
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,620
I build any more...

419
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,670
you talking it'd come down
like a house of cards.

420
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,590
That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.

421
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,090
And for the favour, I can offer you
3 days of work a week in here,

422
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,310
and that will keep you off the yard.

423
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,080
What you see in my relationship
with the warden,

424
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,240
is that he does become a...
surrogate father figure.

425
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,830
And that complicates our relationship

426
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,470
because I need to manipulate him
in certain ways,

427
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,190
to do what I need done.

428
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,260
But the more I become
attached to him emotionally,

429
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,220
the more guilt I feel about
manipulating him.

430
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,940
And that's a very interesting dynamic
in Michael's journey.

431
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,200
Who's the pet lover?

432
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,080
He'll deny it but he's D. B. Cooper.

433
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,990
Parachute out of a plane 30 years ago
with a million and a half in cash.

434
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,450
Doesn't look like the type.

435
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,800
Much like the warden character,

436
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,557
I think D. B. Cooper
eventually represents

437
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,860
some kind of surrogate father to me.

438
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,750
I heard you were D. B. Cooper.

439
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,840
You want a Cooper story?

440
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,670
I can't give it to you.

441
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,170
'Cause I'm not him.

442
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,310
It's too bad.

443
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,930
Sort of wished it was true.

444
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,520
Man's a legend.

445
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,720
Nowhere near as much as I wish
it were true, friend.

446
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,840
I'd have a million five
waiting for me on the outside.

447
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,520
What D. B. Cooper represents to me,
initially,

448
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,580
is simply a man with a lot of cash
on the outside,

449
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,140
which we'll need
once we break out of prison.

450
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,230
So I try to enlist him in the...
escape plan.

451
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,600
Do you ever think about Boston?

452
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,280
Sure.

453
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,910
Think you'll ever see it again?

454
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,770
I'm a 60 year old man,
and there're 60 years left on my ticket.

455
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,150
What do you think?

456
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,950
I'm thinking about going.

457
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,980
Ah there's going and there's... going.

458
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,970
Which one do you mean?

459
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,120
The one you think I mean.

460
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,210
The character that I'm playing
plays other characters.

461
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,670
With the warden,
he's kind of a surrogate son,

462
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,900
with the mob boss,
he's an antagonist who

463
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,560
has something in his possession that
that mob boss desperately needs.

464
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,120
He is a brilliant chess player,

465
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,320
but discovers as he goes along that...

466
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,370
they aren't partners, they're people.

467
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,310
And...

468
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,361
it's... it really makes for some
very complicated

469
00:20:24,362 --> 00:20:25,570
and engaging drama.

470
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,240
<i>Coming up,</i>

471
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,530
<i>we'll unravel the web of cover-ups
and conspiracy</i>

472
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,360
<i>that could reach to
the highest levels of government.</i>

473
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,576
What is it about this case
the Secret Services

474
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:37,590
are so interested in?

475
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,270
<i>And the mysterious woman behind it.</i>

476
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,600
Move on the younger brother

477
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,130
before anything bite
any of us in the ass.

478
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,350
<i>Plus, we'll join the cast</i>

479
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,190
<i>inside the notorious
real life penitenciary</i>

480
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
<i>that is the home for Prison Break.</i>

481
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,640
<i>And hear their terrifying stories.</i>

482
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,960
It's a bit spooky here,

483
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,040
maybe haunted would be a better word.

484
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,950
<i>When Prison Break Behind the Walls
continues.</i>

485
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,600
It's time we stop
beating around the bush gentlemen,

486
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,180
and go after the damn bush!

487
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,820
Burrows.

488
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,420
4100.

489
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,370
Take the only thing Burrows has left:
time.

490
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,260
After all, the chair isn't the only way
to take a man's life in prison.

491
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,420
There is a large government conspiracy

492
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,300
that put my brother behind bars
in the first place.

493
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,110
And what you...
ultimately learn is that

494
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,440
forces larger than all of us

495
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,010
are at work here,
to make him look guilty.

496
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,370
The evidence was there.

497
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,960
The evidence was cooked.

498
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,690
They're introduced
to two Secret Service agents.

499
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,370
They're not sure who exactly
they're working for,

500
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,550
who are committed to making sure
that this frame up

501
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,230
is carried through
to the end of a boy and of...

502
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,210
my brother being executed for a crime
that he did not commit.

503
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,340
The closer it gets,

504
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,140
the more I'm worrying that the bottom
is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

505
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,450
In one month,

506
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,840
it'll all be over.

507
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,130
My character's name is
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Services

508
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,420
and what I like most
about playing him is that...

509
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,030
he's extremely effective and efficient,
and streamlined.

510
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,200
He's kind of Michael's
doppelgänger really,

511
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,900
on the outside of the prison.

512
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,710
Kellerman is also clever,

513
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,330
and obsessed and committed.

514
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,750
But he's committed to...
foiling Michael's plan.

515
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,720
It's our understanding that you have
great influence with the governor.

516
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,480
We're friends.

517
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,560
It's also our understanding
that you're opposed to death penalty.

518
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,940
I'm a man of God, how could I not?

519
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,760
In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.

520
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,740
If the inmate appeals to me
for intervention,

521
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,740
how can I turn my back on him?

522
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,430
Are you saying you won't do it?

523
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,420
I'm not a man to equivocate.

524
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,570
Admirable.

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,490
What's important about Kellerman,

526
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,440
in a character like Kellerman, is that

527
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,620
you might look at him as the bad guy.

528
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,410
But, he has a mission,
and he is gonna get

529
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,319
the mission
that has been assigned to him done,

530
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,740
any way possible.

531
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,920
He fully believes that what he is doing
is for the good of the country.

532
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,430
This guy does not...
think he is a bad man at all.

533
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
He can think in fact, he is doing

534
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,410
absolutely the good thing
for a higher cause.

535
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,573
All right, Scofield had no priors
and a full time job as an engineer.

536
00:23:38,574 --> 00:23:39,100
Correct.

537
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,740
Obviously, something's up.

538
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,890
Move on the younger brother.

539
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,140
What I love about the mysterious woman
is that

540
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,720
the setting seems so domestic.

541
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,290
and tranquil and...

542
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,410
"Martha Stewart Asks",

543
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,080
and yet, directing
the Secret Service Agents to carry out

544
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,620
...their nefarious schemes...

545
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,690
It's representative of a conspiracy
at the highest levels!

546
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,110
Hello?

547
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,840
We have a small complication.

548
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,570
There's a lawyer poking around.

549
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,510
Veronica Donovan.

550
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,620
Yes.

551
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,390
Anyone that's a threat
to what we're doing is expendable.

552
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,000
Anyone.

553
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,900
Understood.

554
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,070
The Secret Services are terrified
that she's gonna... uncover the plot.

555
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,920
I deserve to know.
I loved him as much as you did.

556
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,310
Lincoln and I were romantically
involved.

557
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,190
And basically,
before Michael gets himself thrown in,

558
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,920
I had pretty much written off Lincoln
and believed that he is guilty.

559
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,770
When he got thrown into prison...

560
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,180
she was at the point of...

561
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,680
She believed like many
that he did commit the crime and she...

562
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,290
basically... you know,
left him there.

563
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,530
Michael's in here because he thinks
you're innocent.

564
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,030
What's he told you?

565
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,850
He isn't telling me anything
but I know, Lincoln.

566
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,690
I know what he is planning.

567
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,910
Call him off.

568
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,160
If you love him, call him off.

569
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,940
I saw the tape.

570
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:26,938
I haven't done what you saw.

571
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,840
I know what I saw.

572
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,680
Through Michael's actions,

573
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,190
she's been forced
to reevaluate the sentence

574
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,860
and as a result of that,
she started to find...

575
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,800
you know, holes in the case.

576
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,467
On your risk what I'm talking to you

577
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:42,400
'cause they'll kill your boy
like they killed mine.

578
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,798
Coroner's report says
what killed your boyfriend,

579
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,040
Leticia, was an overdose.

580
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,990
No, they killed him.

581
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,330
'Cause he knew things.

582
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
Things they didn't want to get out.

583
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,510
Like what?

584
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,450
Like who is really behind that hit
that night.

585
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,080
Sure as hell wasn't Lincoln.

586
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,059
None of them knew
what they were getting into,

587
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,670
they were just pawns in a big game.

588
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,900
I'd get as far away from him
as you can girl.

589
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,310
'Cause there's nobody they can't get to.

590
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,170
<i>Uncovering what exactly</i>

591
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,160
<i>is going on trying to find evidence
to exonerate Lincoln,</i>

592
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,130
I'm starting to realize

593
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,110
this is bigger than anybody thought.

594
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,515
You see anything? Definitive cuts

595
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:16,620
any place that proves the tape
might have been cooked?

596
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,910
The thing's clean! No footprints.

597
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,410
Here's the audio track from the tape.

598
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,630
Sound pretty true, right?

599
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,030
Yeah.

600
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,520
But noise is a lie.
It doesn't just die like that.

601
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,790
What does that mean?

602
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,280
The sound of the gunshot.

603
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,450
It wasn't recorded in that room.

604
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,140
I start to realize that Lincoln
wasn't guilty.

605
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,350
And I commit my time
to sort of uncovering

606
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
this conspiracy that's going on.

607
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,340
And I'm dedicating all my time
to Lincoln.

608
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,670
<i>Coming up...</i>

609
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,390
<i>we'll take a closer look
at the intricate plan</i>

610
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,630
<i>that is at the center of Prison Break.</i>

611
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,950
We got a runner!

612
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,630
<i>And the beginning of a romance</i>

613
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,260
<i>that could sabotage the entire escape.</i>

614
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,100
I'll take you to dinner.

615
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,710
Lunch?

616
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,740
Cup of coffee?

617
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,960
<i>Plus the cast reveals
some surprising secrets...</i>

618
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,497
<i>of what lies ahead.</i>

619
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,340
Well, I'll say that you shouldn't
get attached to anyone.

620
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,280
I mean, anyone.

621
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,070
<i>All when Prison Break Behind the Walls
returns.</i>

622
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,550
I'm Michael, by the way.

623
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
Scofield. I've read your report.

624
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,140
And you are?

625
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,370
Doctor Tancredi will do.

626
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
Tancredi like the governor?

627
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,830
By coming to my relationship with

628
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,419
Dr. Sandra Tancredi,

629
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,400
I need to be in the infirmary
where she works

630
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,270
because there is a certain grate there

631
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,550
that I need access to which is going
to figure into our plans later on,

632
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,390
And to that end, I'm

633
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,960
prentendig to be a diabetic,

634
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,520
so I can go in and get an insuline shot

635
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,760
on a regular basis.

636
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,060
Tattoo? It's fresh!

637
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,130
Hold up.

638
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,670
I guess being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.

639
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,730
Gotta launch into that relationship

640
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,800
simply hoping to manipulate her.

641
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,640
To use her to accomplish
what I need to accomplish.

642
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,630
But find, slowly but surely,

643
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,990
that there may, in fact,
be a relationship there.

644
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,100
Be up a change
you wanna see in the world.

645
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,070
I think they're people
who are surprisingly...

646
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,930
similar to one another.

647
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,550
What?

648
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,030
Nothing, that was just my senior quote.

649
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,200
That was you?

650
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,800
This whole time,
I was thinking it was Gandhi!

651
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,260
You're very funny.

652
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,210
And were he on the other side
of the bars...

653
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,790
He's someone...

654
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,030
with whom she could at least
have a profound friendship

655
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,090
and potentially, have

656
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,050
the kind of unique

657
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,410
consonant understanding that

658
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,950
happens very very rarely in life.

659
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,000
You know you're gonna get killed
in here, right?

660
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,750
If you're not careful?

661
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
I'm like you I bet.

662
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,730
When I get out of here, alive,

663
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,140
I'll take you to dinner.

664
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,090
Lunch?

665
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,080
A cup of coffee?

666
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,430
Michael, this...

667
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,560
this charm act...

668
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,620
could be exactly what's getting you
into trouble out in the yard.

669
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,440
I think what constantly surprises me
about it is...

670
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,870
it's a show that tries to...

671
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,270
change a pattern
as soon as it's established.

672
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,170
Just as soon as you see

673
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,720
Michael's mask,

674
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,650
perfectly applied, day after day,

675
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,000
it cracks.

676
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,400
Those twists and turns every week...

677
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh my God, the hero, the hero!

678
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,890
The hero is in trouble! How is he... oh!

679
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,360
Look, he's gonna make it! Oh, no!

680
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,159
There's another wall
he's getting out through.

681
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,490
There is another conflict here.

682
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,570
It's just basic good story-telling.

683
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,030
You're a dead man Scofield!

684
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,280
You hear me?!

685
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,050
You're just dead!

686
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,870
Don't let the hero off the hook.

687
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,815
Just don't let him off the hook.
If you do:

688
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,896
end of the story.

689
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,010
It's a roller coaster.
It's really one of those things that...

690
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,020
It takes you from left to right,
right to left,

691
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,930
It just keeps you... on your toes.

692
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,430
I think one of the most clever part
of the show

693
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,920
is that there's a little puzzle
for the audience to solve

694
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,180
in each and every episode.

695
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,530
They're given a set of facts
or information

696
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,989
that you immediately assume in one thing

697
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,190
and at the end of the episode,

698
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:39,350
you find out they mean something
entirely different.

699
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,440
One episode...

700
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,830
deals with what you think
is another inmate named

701
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,280
Allen Schweitzer, name that you hear
referenced a couple of times.

702
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,800
Allen Schweitzer.

703
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,870
The name mean anything to you?

704
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,400
- Should it?
- I don't know, you tell me.

705
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,690
Never heard of the guy.

706
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,320
It's actually a reference to Schweitzer,

707
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,160
which is the name of the company
that made the toilet in my prison cell

708
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,102
that we're actually going to dismantle

709
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:11,340
and get behind
to break through that wall.

710
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,960
And Allen is a reference to huh...
an Allen wrench,

711
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,960
which is what I need to get my hands on

712
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,040
in order to dismantle the toilet.

713
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,490
And they've got reference to...

714
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,790
what you think of individuals' names
English, Fitz and Percy.

715
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,080
We have a decision to make.

716
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,630
- Yeah.
- English,

717
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,280
Fitz or Percy.

718
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,730
If we're gonna pull this off,

719
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,570
we need to single one of them out.

720
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,770
And this being prison,

721
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,520
you assume that I mean that

722
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,410
they're guards or other inmates

723
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,360
that we have to...
execute but they're actually...

724
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,470
street names.

725
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,030
There are three streets
on the exterior of the prison

726
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,440
English, Fitz and Percy.

727
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,610
And one of them will be the street
that we'll take out of the prison.

728
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,350
So I break out of my cell,
head off to the roof of the prison,

729
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,420
and intentionally set off an alarm.

730
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,700
We got a runner!

731
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,230
Once an inmate escapes,

732
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,218
obviously, a lot of
law enforcement parties

733
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,620
are set into motion.

734
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,370
So I can see from which direction

735
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:27,430
the State Troopers
and helicopters will be coming,

736
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,410
and so, when I see the cop cars
coming down English,

737
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,050
and I see the cop cars
coming down Percy,

738
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,640
and Fitz remains open, I know, Okay.

739
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,770
When we finally escape,
Fitz is the road to take.

740
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:49,420
<i>Coming up, the family drama
that is at the heart of Prison Break.</i>

741
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,070
Love you.

742
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,480
Always loved you.

743
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,820
<i>And we'll go inside the real life</i>

744
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,410
<i>Prison Break penitenciary</i>

745
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,314
<i>that has been the final stop</i>

746
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,970
<i>for some of the world's
most notorious criminals.</i>

747
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,890
John Wayne Gacy was in a cell here,
my effect's that's Lincoln's cell.

748
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:07,800
<i>When Prison Break Behind the Walls
continues.</i>

749
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,930
5 years. Sentence to be carried out
immediately.

750
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,020
Uncle Mike?

751
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,640
I didn't want you to come.

752
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,660
Go home L.J.

753
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,830
I didn't want you to see this.

754
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,230
The show is a family drama.

755
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,360
It's about brothers...

756
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,130
and especially fathers and sons.

757
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,650
Two pounds of pot?

758
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,500
What were you trying to do?
Set a record?

759
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,860
It's not funny, L.J.,
you could be going to jail.

760
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,810
Last semester, you were getting almost
all As and now...

761
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,230
It's your father, isn't it?

762
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,810
I don't have a father.

763
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,913
Life thrusts on him a role
that he's not ready to play,

764
00:33:57,914 --> 00:33:59,290
which is being a man at 15.

765
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,220
And, when that happens,
you get rebellion.

766
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,670
I'm not asking you to love me.

767
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,530
I... already screwed up the chance
long ago.

768
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm asking you to love yourself.

769
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,070
So that's what fatherly advice is like?

770
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,150
They're putting me to death, L.J.

771
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,530
In a month time, I'll be dead.

772
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,580
You get that?

773
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,970
You're already dead to me.

774
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:32,300
One of the things that surprised me
is the depth to this story.

775
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,580
Give me your hand.

776
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,870
What are you doing?

777
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,060
Give me your hand.

778
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,620
He reaches out to his son

779
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,550
and says... "I wanna go to my grave"...

780
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,440
"resolving the inner conflict"
that they both have towards one another.

781
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,960
"I may achieve that."

782
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,520
I want you to be here.

783
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,840
I want you to be there
the day before I die.

784
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,960
So I can see you.

785
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,030
So I can hold you.

786
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,230
I love you.

787
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,780
I've always loved you.

788
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,210
The center of it is like just family,
you know,

789
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,610
It's not about the crime,
it's not about, you know, the jail.

790
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,910
I mean that's just the symptom
of a family, 'cause what more

791
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,330
would you go and commit a crime for
than you would for family?

792
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,900
What more would you do anything?

793
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,460
There's nothing more meaningful

794
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,260
really on the Earth
that I could think of.

795
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,519
Not money, not huh... anything,

796
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,270
but it's their love, you know?

797
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,500
And if that love doesn't...
exist then...

798
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,890
then why do we...
why do we do anything for it?

799
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,340
<i>To create the realistic
and terrifying world of Prison Break,</i>

800
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,530
<i>the producers decided to film</i>

00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,610

00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,280
...all those nights...

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,430
<i>For over 150 years,</i>

808
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,432
<i>Joliet was one of the world's
most notorious</i>

00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:13,010
maximum security prisons,

810
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,520
<i>home to such infamous
and cold-blooded criminals</i>

811
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,660

<i>one of the most
shocking murderers of all,</i>

816
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,430
<i>John Wayne Gacy.</i>

817
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,350
I'm not gonna pretend
that I have any idea what it's like

818
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,520
to be in an actual prison.

819
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,780
I feel very fortunate
that we're here at Joliet

820
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,890
because it's an incredible place
with an incredible history in the news.

821
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,800
150 years of pain and

822
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,320
violence and fear
are soaked into these walls and

823
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,630
I like to think of Joliet
as another character

824
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,120
in the story,
adding a certain authenticity and

825
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,810
essence that we couldn't duplicate
on a sound stage somewhere.

826
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,880
Be mark!

827
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,300
Action!

828
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Being here at Joliet, being here
in an actual prison gives you

829
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,220
a sure middle taste
of what it's like to be there.

830
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,450
These 40 feet walls,
with the razor wire on the top,

831
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,070
these watchtowers on every corner,
it's imposing.

832
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,960
It's an incredible place
in that it...

833
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,160
just captures you know, the...

834
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,980
the intensity of the darkness
of human nature.

835
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,100
You just come in here
and you feel that kind of...

836
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,990
it's like a...
creepy muzzy kind of feeling.

837
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,270
Apparently, some of the boys
are saying they felt like the ghost of

838
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,220
John Wayne Gacy touching them.

839
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,870
I don't know if they're making it up,

840
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,057
but I personally,
have not been in the cell

841
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,230
where people are feeling
John Wayne Gacy's touch

842
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,900
I don't necessarily believe in... the...

843
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,220
supernatural or ghosts, whatever but

844
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,310
the crew have noticed

845
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,497
a few things
and you don't wanna hang out here

846
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,500
all by yourself too much,

847
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,930
it gets pretty... pretty tense.

848
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,920
<i>Just a few years ago,</i>

849
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,070
<i>Joliet State Penitenciary was declared</i>

850
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,420
<i>no longer suitable to house prisoners</i>

851
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,890
<i>and was decommissionned.</i>

852
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,870
<i>But it has become the perfect home
for Prison Break.</i>

853
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,900
They have deemed this place

854
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,820
uninhabitable for criminals,
they deserve better.

855
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,857
But let's get some actors
and some crew people,

856
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,630
throw them in there,
they'll do anything.

857
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,180
Welcome to Prisony Land, Fish!

858
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:22,089
There were ever a several things
I didn't understand but, you know

859
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,550
I talked to these buddies,

860
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,460
that I called up that had been in prison
and said: "What's this world out?

861
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,310
I don't know what it is!

862
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,480
Yo Fish?! What you lookin' at?!

863
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,730
You look kind of pretty
to be up in here, man!

864
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,730
What d'you know about this fish?

865
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,880
He's my new celly.

866
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,590
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.

867
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,500
I didn't think you were
the agitating type.

868
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,000
90 days in the SHU!

869
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,400
That ought to be enough time
to convince you of that fact.

870
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,500
Trey Street Deuces got the hoops.

871
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,630
Norteños got the bleachers.

872
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,870
Woods got the weight pile.

873
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,130
The C.O.'s got the rest.

874
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,400
And a lot... you know,
some have been here in this prison,

875
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:58,910
and I said:

876
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:00,910
" Does that sound real to you,
does that sound..."

877
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,525
"Does the world sound right to you,

878
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:04,134
is the language right?",
they say: "Yeah".

879
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,340
"Yeah, you're right on,
keep going, keep going."

880
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,210
<i>Coming up,</i>

881
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,529
<i>we'll reveal
some of the cast's predictions</i>

882
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,150
<i>of the shocking twists and turns</i>

883
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,240
<i>that lie ahead.</i>

884
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,020
Something serious

885
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,706
potentially lethal
can happen to any of us.

886
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,600
Like it could shank in any time!

887
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,010
<i>When Prison Break Behind the Walls
continues.</i>

888
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,590
<i>In just the first 7 episodes
of Prison Break,</i>

889
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,910
<i>Michael Scofield has put in motion</i>

890
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,530
<i>an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

891
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,820
<i>to save his brother from death row.</i>

892
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,030
- I'm getting you out of here.
- It's impossible.

893
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,790
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

894
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,440
<i>His plan involves
getting himself arrested</i>

895
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,490
<i>and thrown into the same prison,</i>

896
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,560
<i>an intricate tattoo
that hides the map of the jail</i>

897
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,150
- You've seen the blueprints?
- Better than that.

898
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,480
I've got them on me.

899
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,840
<i>and the mysterious details
required for the escape.</i>

900
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,330
<i>He's aligned himself with prisonners...</i>

901
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,290
<i>those good...</i>

902
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,230
When do we get started?

903
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,670
<i>...and bad...</i>

904
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,050
<i>...will be instrumentaled to his plan.</i>

905
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,600
<i>As well as prison officials
who will be his unwilling accomplices.</i>

906
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,484
It's better for me
to owe you one in here

907
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,990
than it is for you to owe me one,
I can promise you that.

908
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,450
<i>Outside the prison,</i>

909
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,780
<i>we've learned Michael's brother</i>

910
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,869
<i>may have been framed
in a conspiracy</i>

911
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,020
<i>that could reach to the highest levels
of the US government.</i>

912
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:27,290
- There's a lawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

913
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,630
<i>And nonetheless for Michael,
a full scale prison riot</i>

914
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,000
<i>had not only threatened the lives
of those he cares about...</i>

915
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,210
Come on! Get my hand!

916
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,880
<i>...it had threatened
to expose his plan...</i>

917
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,280
I'm breaking out.

918
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,280
<i>and guarantee
his brother's execution...</i>

919
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,870
<i>So what twist and turns
lie ahead in Prison Break?</i>

920
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,640
Well, I'd say
that you shouldn't get attached

921
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:50,310
to anyone.

922
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,370
I mean... anyone.

923
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,130
Like it could shank in any time!

924
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,650
Something serious

925
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,260
potentially lethal can happen
to any of us at any time.

926
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,520
I'm not allowed to say, I don't know!

927
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,298
Makes me nervous
just talking about it.

928
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:05,470
See? They're watching me!

929
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,930
I predict I'm gonna go
through some crazy stuff.

930
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,070
There might be another one joining us.

931
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,160
I can probably say that.

932
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,710
Can I? Maybe, I don't know...

933
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,210
I personally think it'd be kind of funny

934
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,680
if they killed my brother,

935
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,890
and I'm stuck in prison,
and I still have to get out!

936
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,520
The biggest surprise would be
if he was actually the killer.

937
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,900
I mean there were shows that
I watched as a kid, growing up

938
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,290
that I loved and they'd end
and I'd go: "God"!

939
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,050
What happens next?!

940
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,950
It's so exciting that people walk up to:
"I have to know!".

941
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,530
What I liked to make me...
liked to make myself feel better about

942
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,560
my place in the world... I say...
You know, I can't tell you.

943
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,120
But generally, I really don't know.

944
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,840
If we ever break out,
and I'm assuming that we do,

945
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,300
we're on the run, so that it takes on
a fugitive kind of... field.

946
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,240
There'll be a large number of us,

947
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,220
and we'll probably split up each of us

948
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,240
to accomplish whatever it is
that we need to accomplish.

949
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,400
Then, it's all about uncovering

950
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,780
the conspiracy that puts Lincoln in jail
in the first place.

951
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,730
And I would imagine
the audience at that point

952
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,500
rooting for me
and my brother to...

953
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,150
solve the goverment conspiracy.
Rooting for Sucre

954
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,410
to stop his girlfriend's wedding
to the wrong man.

955
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,100
But hoping and praying

956
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,480
that T-Bag is caught
by the authorities.

957
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,040
And I'm guessing that he will continue
to elude them.

958
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,520
I kind of have fantasies of Lincoln
heading off to Hawaï and...

959
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,440
surfing and drinking beer...

960
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,940
But I'm hoping for Monica sins
with all the hot guys,

961
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,610
like that's what I'm hoping
that the future will bring.

962
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,280
Steamy Monica'd sin, so,
I'm looking forward to some of those.

963
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,650
They come up with these fascinating
twist and turns,

964
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,730
that only ratchets the suspense
and the tension up, higher and higher.

965
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,890
And every episode is better
than the one before.

966
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,600
<i>No matter what the future holds
in the intricate story of Prison Break,</i>

967
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,080
<i>one thing is certain...</i>

968
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,510
<i>The roller coaster ride
of thrills and danger,</i>

969
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,610
<i>treachery and betrayal</i>

970
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,730
<i>has only just begun.</i>

971
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,990
<i>And on October, 24...</i>

972
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,330
<i>1 hour before the story resumes
with a brand new episode,</i>

973
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,287
<i>You'll have a chance
to see a special anchor</i>

974
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:20,080
of the episode leading up to it.

975
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,150
<i>So make you own plans</i>

976
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,150
<i>to break into TV's
hardest new drama:</i>
