1
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,452
- I need money.
- Yes, it is a lovely morning, isn't it?

2
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,048
The sun is shining, the birds are chirping.

3
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,419
Only dentist I know who can't make money.

4
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,656
Oh, really? What about her father?

5
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,092
As a dentist,
my husband was very successful.

6
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,257
- It was just that other stuff.
- Yes, there's a word for that.

7
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,336
It's called embezzlement.

8
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,298
Speaking of which,
how much do you need, dear?

9
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,812
- Five should probably do it.
- Thousand? For what?

10
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,980
You know what? Your father would be proud.

11
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,932
I'll... see what I can do. In the meantime,
you ladies have a lovely day.

12
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,180
I would... if you'd do me a favour and die!

13
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,611
Life is driving you to drink

14
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,610
You sit around wondering just what to think

15
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,856
Well, I got some consolation

16
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,134
I'll give it to you if I might

17
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,016
You know, I don't worry 'bout a thing

18
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,450
Cos I know nothing's gonna be all right

19
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,777
You know, this world
is just one big trouble spot

20
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,929
Cos some have plenty and some have not

21
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,016
You know, I used to be troubled

22
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,815
But I finally saw the light

23
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,172
Now I don't worry 'bout a thing

24
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,373
Cos I know nothing's going to be all right

25
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,290
Don't waste your time
trying to be a go-getter

26
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,937
Things'll get worse
before they get any better

27
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,255
You know, there's always somebody

28
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,496
Playin' with dynamite

29
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,696
But I don't worry 'bout a thing

30
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,369
Cos I know nothing's going to be all right

31
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,770
Excuse me. Are you threatening me?

32
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,732
I didn't think so.
Look, I changed my mind, OK?

33
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,571
Yes, I'll get you your money back.

34
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,898
Oui, oui madame DuPré. Mardi à trois heures.

35
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,778
Oui. A bientôt.

36
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,976
Morning, Doctor.

37
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,931
OK. Good news, Monsieur Boulez.

38
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,494
We're not gonna pull the tooth.
We'll just drill.

39
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,656
Ecoutez-moi, docteur. No drill.

40
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,736
- No drill?
- No drill.

41
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,332
I hate the drill. So you just gas me, pull
the tooth out and we'll still be friends. OK?

42
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,052
Good!

43
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,976
- I just want a hamburger and fries.
- I'm gonna have a hamburger

44
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,091
- with no mayonnaise this time.
- No?

45
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,973
No mayonnaise. Not at all. OK?

46
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,295
- She's gonna put mayonnaise on it.
- Do you mind if I say something?

47
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,690
Leave the bitch.

48
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,054
- Excuse me?
- Your wife. Leave her.

49
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,171
Find somebody else and just start over.

50
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,894
- Jill...
- Oz, look. I know it's none of my business.

51
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,057
I know I've only been working
for you for three weeks.

52
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,970
But I'm just telling you what I see, mister.
Your wife is not a good person.

53
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,412
- You're expecting an argument?
- So why torture yourself? Just divorce her!

54
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,738
I can't afford to. She'd take me to the
cleaners. I'm already paying her father's debt.

55
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,939
So she's gonna ride it out till Daddy's
debt gets paid. She's just charming.

56
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,694
She can't help it. Her mother...

57
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,653
What's a nice way of... Her... It's...

58
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,532
Well, she's the Antichrist.

59
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,856
You know, you'd be doing the world
a favour if you'd just have her whacked.

60
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,293
- You know somebody who would do this?
- Present company excluded?

61
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,411
- Voilà.
- Merci.

62
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,054
Talking hypothetically
or shall I name a price?

63
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,490
You should talk to my wife.
You'd make a fortune.

64
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,975
- What makes you say that?
- Life insurance.

65
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,819
I'm worth more dead than alive.

66
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,173
Yeah, just, dining room.
Take the plastic junk off of there.

67
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,416
Can you move any slower than this, fellas?

68
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,218
Hi! You must be our new neighbour.
I'm Nicholas Oseransky. Call me Oz.

69
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,416
- Jimmy.
- Hi.

70
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,496
Jimmy Jones.

71
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,897
- Have we met before?
- No.

72
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,409
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

73
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,499
- I'd remember. I got a thing with faces.
- You look familiar. Where are you from?

74
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,770
Mr Jones, where do you want this?

75
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,456
Order! Order!

76
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,538
Upstairs, back bedroom.
What were you saying?

77
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,016
- You all right?
- Yes.

78
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,576
You sure? Because you look...
like you got some gas.

79
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,695
I-I-I had a hamburger for lunch.

80
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,216
- They put mayonnaise on it?
- Yes.

81
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,376
Can you tell me why they do that?

82
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,889
Every red-blooded American knows the only
condiment you ever put on a hamburger

83
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,976
is ketchup!

84
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,568
Or maybe some of that special sauce
you like so much here in Canada!

85
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,656
Which I think has mayonnaise in it too!

86
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,614
But when they slap that mayonnaise
on there, I could kill somebody!

87
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,499
I really, really didn't wanna upset you.

88
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,056
Who's upset?
I'm just having a conversation here.

89
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,938
- I'm gonna go home.
- OK.

90
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,016
- Feel better.
- Thank you.

91
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,410
- Oz!
- Yes!

92
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,013
Thanks for stopping by...
welcoming me to the neighbourhood.

93
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,616
OK.

94
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,495
Pack up! Pack up! We're leaving.

95
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,576
Jesus!

96
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,738
Jesus! I just bumped into
our new next-door neighbour.

97
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,250
- Do you have any idea who that is?
- I suppose you're going to tell me.

98
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,496
That's Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski.

99
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,171
- And that means something?
- He was a hit man for the Gogolak gang!

100
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,059
The Gogolak gang! The Hungarian gang
back in Chicago that ran the North Side?

101
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,650
That guy Jimmy was
Lazlo Gogolak's key enforcer!

102
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,729
- Sexy!
- Sophie, the man's killed 17 people.

103
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,536
- Why the stupid name?
- The Tulip?

104
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,619
That's his flower of choice.
It's what he sent to his victims' funerals.

105
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,459
- I wonder what he's doing here?
- Hiding out, most likely.

106
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,334
He ratted out Lazlo Gogolak. Lazlo's
spending the rest of his life in prison.

107
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,011
Jimmy only got five years.
Dave told me he refused witness protection.

108
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,337
- Protection from?
- I'm sure Lazlo's son Janni wants to put

109
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,452
one of those... you know, a price on his head.

110
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,136
You mean a... a contract?

111
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,016
A mob contract?

112
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,653
- Feelin' better?
- Yes, thank you.

113
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,812
- Let's go for a drive.
- A drive?

114
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,170
- Yeah, a drive.
- Well...

115
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,336
I don't know anyone else in town.

116
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,499
I figure we could go for a drive.
Show me the sights, you know?

117
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,816
- It won't kill you.
- Promise?

118
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,249
- So I take it you're not Canadian?
- Only by marriage.

119
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,976
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

120
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,574
Not Chicago... Chicago.

121
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,535
I was born there but... I don't really know
anything about Chicago any more.

122
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,295
OK.

123
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,891
Yeah! Totally oblivious
to anything even related to Chicago.

124
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,890
- I'm from Jersey.
- New Jersey?

125
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,977
Yeah. New Jersey.

126
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,415
If you're from Jersey, you're from Jersey.

127
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,055
Jersey is another place
I know absolutely nothing about.

128
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,375
- You always this nervous?
- Yes.

129
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,170
Like virtually everything else that's wrong
in my life, it all started with the little missis.

130
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,293
Back home, her father and I
ran a dental practice together.

131
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,976
- You're a dentist?
- 'Fraid so.

132
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,699
- You suicidal?
- See, now, why would you say that?

133
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,493
I once read that dentists are prone to suicide.

134
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,295
Jimmy, I may hate my life
but I certainly don't wanna die.

135
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,293
You better get used to it
because you're going to.

136
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,378
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna strangle you!

137
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,136
Everybody dies...

138
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,536
sooner or later.

139
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,218
- Tulip?
- No!

140
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,893
So you were sayin', your father-in-law...

141
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,409
Well, ironically, he was a suicide.

142
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,249
- Stats don't lie.
- He got caught molesting a patient.

143
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,690
An underage patient.
An underage male patient.

144
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,177
- Please, stop!
- I know. So this kid starts to blackmail him.

145
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,259
And this is at the exact same time the IRS
decides to investigate him for tax fraud.

146
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,658
So big Aaron needs money, and fast,
so he goes to a loan shark,

147
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,410
takes out a loan against our company,
which I had no idea about, then proceeds...

148
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,576
To hit Vegas, Atlantic City, Reno.

149
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,773
Loses all the money
and sticks you with the bill. Am I right?

150
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,573
You are right. That's exactly right.

151
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,690
So, after the ensuing scandal
and bankruptcy and embarrassment,

152
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,450
my wife and her mother decided
it would be best that we move back here.

153
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,975
You like livin' in Canada?

154
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,455
No, I... I live here with my wife.

155
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,771
You sure you're a dentist?

156
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,892
- Yeah. Why?
- Cos I've never met a dentist I liked.

157
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,010
Well, I try to keep things
as painless as possible.

158
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,934
Me too.

159
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,498
Hey.

160
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,169
It's been good.
I'm glad we got to know each other.

161
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,849
You know what? Me too.

162
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,051
- You can go now.
- Right.

163
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,651
- Oz!
- Yes, dear.

164
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,330
- Thank God you're home.
- Thank God I'm home?

165
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,009
I had an idea. I figured out a way
we can pay off Daddy's debt.

166
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,569
- You're getting ajob!
- No!

167
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,488
- No.
- Our neighbour. There's a price on his head?

168
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,815
That's your plan? Murder our neighbour?

169
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,652
Here's what you're going to do.

170
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,808
You're going to Chicago to find out who
it is who's offering this price on his head.

171
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,853
- Jimmy Tudeski's head!
- Then you tell them you know where he is...

172
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,770
- after you negotiate a finder's fee.
- A finder's fee on a murder contract?

173
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,732
- Is there a problem?
- It would make me a party to... a murder.

174
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,011
- But he's a killer. You said so yourself.
- That's another good reason not to do it.

175
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,179
OK? And whatever he's done, he's been
to prison. He's paid his debt to society.

176
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,256
Well, now he can pay our debt, too.

177
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,814
Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy,

178
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,650
but I spent some time with the guy
today and he's... pretty nice, you know?

179
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,340
Besides, he hasn't done anything to me.

180
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,330
- He came on to me.
- What?

181
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,699
He came on to me!
That animal - he made a pass at me!

182
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,175
When?

183
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,860
Earlier. This morning.
Before you came home.

184
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,653
He said you guys haven't even met.

185
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,056
- Who do you believe? A killer or your wife?
- Do I have to answer that?

186
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,011
- Nicholas!
- OK, OK!

187
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,337
Let's say... that he did make a pass at you.

188
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,056
He's been in prison for five years. He's
desperate. He'd sleep with a meat grinder.

189
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,740
You pig! You disgust me!

190
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,328
There's a known killer living right next door

191
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,736
who might slaughter us in our sleep
and you won't lift a finger!

192
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,058
That's right. I'm not gonna lift
a finger, because this is crazy.

193
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,056
You do this for me...

194
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,134
and I give you your divorce.

195
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,738
And if you don't do this for me, I swear,
I'll make your life so damned miserable

196
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,648
it'll make these past few years
seem like a pleasure cruise.

197
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,533
I already booked your flight.
You leave tomorrow at 9am.

198
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,776
You better start packing.

199
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,492
OK, well, when are you coming back?
I have to reschedule all your appointments.

200
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,373
- No more than a couple of days.
- Are you going alone?

201
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,489
Yes.

202
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,410
Good. Can you do me a huge favour
while you're there? Go out and get laid!

203
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,410
- Jill!
- Call me the second you get back.

204
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,056
Better yet, call me right after.
Call me during. I want all the details.

205
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,818
All right, now don't expect too much.
I'm not even sure I'll be able to make contact.

206
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,138
It's not as if the Gogolaks
have a 1800 number or anything.

207
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,216
I know you'll do what you can.

208
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,856
What is this?

209
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,130
Good luck, my darling.

210
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,216
And hurry home.

211
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,130
Do they have vomit bags on the flight?

212
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,617
You're Jimmy Tudeski, aren't you?
Jimmy the Tulip?

213
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,657
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me, sexy.

214
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,219
But... you will never believe
what my darling husband is up to.

215
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,339
You're back in Chicago? Great!

216
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,248
Tell you what.
Meet me at Ekins Oyster Bar in 45 minutes.

217
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,693
- Dave, you got nothin' to worry about.
- How can I not worry?

218
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,051
You say you're here to rat
Jimmy Tudeski out to Janni Gogolak...

219
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,490
But I'm not going to rat him out.
Do you think I'm suicidal?

220
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,214
Well, you are a dentist.

221
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,934
Look, I have no intention
of ratting anybody out.

222
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,496
The only reason I'm here is
because I want Sophie off my back.

223
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,533
I've got a deadline. I'll come by
your hotel room as soon as I'm finished.

224
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,448
- Now, promise you won't do anything stupid.
- Why would you even say that?

225
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,536
You married Sophie, didn't you?

226
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,893
I'll get the check, then?

227
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,692
- I'm sorry. I must have the wrong...
- What room you lookin' for?

228
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,850
- 519.
- You're in the right place.

229
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,936
You Nicholas Oseransky?

230
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,180
- Who are you?
- We understand you have information

231
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,929
regarding the whereabouts
of Jimmy the Tulip.

232
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,176
- Who told you that? Dave?
- Who's Dave?

233
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,098
- What... What did he tell you?
- Forget about Dave.

234
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,611
For our immediate purposes,
there is no Dave. Dave does not exist.

235
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,859
So... just answer my question.
Do you or don't you?

236
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,252
Have information regarding
the whereabouts of Jimmy the Tulip?

237
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,168
- I don't know what you're talking about, man.
- Really?

238
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,295
Then I must have been misinformed.

239
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,690
- I apologise.
- It's OK.

240
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,739
Now... let's try this again.

241
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,817
- We understand you have information...
- Who told you that?

242
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,330
Why do you wanna go cluttering your mind
with the inconsequential?

243
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,250
What's important is we know
that you know where Jimmy Tudeski is.

244
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,850
Look, I really have no i...

245
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,419
- Aren't you gonna cry out for help?
- Would it do any good?

246
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,814
No.

247
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,613
- Who are you?
- Franklin Figueroa.

248
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,694
Aka Frankie Figs. I work for Janni Gogolak.

249
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,697
Oh, my God.

250
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,095
So... where's Jimmy?

251
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,177
Look, I sw...

252
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,292
My brother, believe me.
You don't wanna dance with me all night.

253
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,334
And for a scumbag like Jimmy T?
Save yourself the pain.

254
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,816
Look, I really have no idea...

255
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,930
I may know where he is.

256
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,972
Well, all right. But don't tell me.
Let's go tell Janni.

257
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,979
OK. Do you mind if I piss a little blood first?

258
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,056
- Please, by all means.
- Thanks.

259
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,136
My father...

260
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,096
is a great man.

261
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,656
A man of "wision" and...

262
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,929
character.

263
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,014
A man who stood up for his beliefs.

264
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,131
Unlike that rat fuck

265
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,414
piece of shit... Tudeski.

266
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,136
Can you...

267
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,500
ask Cynthia to join us, please?

268
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,696
- You want a drink?
- Oh, no, thanks.

269
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,932
- Have a drink.
- I'll have a Scotch and soda, please.

270
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,056
I want you to understand.

271
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,372
Frankie explained to me you're having
a problem with your conscience.

272
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,335
- Yes, it's just that none of this was my idea.
- Do you think it was mine? No.

273
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,375
If I had my way, my father...

274
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,973
would still be running things
and I'd be somewhere like...

275
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,730
I dunno.

276
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,652
Aruba.

277
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,215
Actually, Aruba's not that nice.

278
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,329
- Excuse me?
- You may like it.

279
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,859
See, I honeymooned there
and that's probably why I didn't like it.

280
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,852
The thing you gotta remember is,
when we're talkin' about Jimmy Tudeski,

281
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,813
we're not talkin' about a human being.

282
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,932
We're talkin' about a rodent.

283
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,416
We're talking about...

284
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,816
"wermin".

285
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,694
- Where was I?
- "Wermin". I think "wermin".

286
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,730
We're talkin' about someone... Screw that!

287
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,328
Some thing

288
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,213
that doesn't deserve to be breathing...

289
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,936
the air.

290
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,415
Janni, talkin' about yourself again?

291
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,375
Mr Oseransky,

292
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,536
this is Cynthia.

293
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,055
Jimmy's wife.

294
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,059
- Cynthia, it seems that Mr...
- Doctor.

295
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,495
- Excuse me?
- Dr Oseransky. He's a dentist.

296
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,448
Whatever.

297
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,017
It seems that our dentist friend here
knows where Jimmy is.

298
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,089
- Oh? Come to collect on the contract?
- No.

299
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,338
Janni, just so you know, since I'm
the one that found this guy... I want it.

300
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,020
- The contract's mine.
- As long as I'm in on the kill.

301
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,578
- So long as I get full price.
- I wanna see that spineless rat beg.

302
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,339
- Money doesn't matter.
- Well, now I've heard everything!

303
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,898
Don't you believe it.
This one? Kill you for a quarter.

304
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,416
Mr Oseransky.

305
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,298
Frankie will accompany you back to Canada.

306
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,969
You will lead him to the man
you believe is Jimmy Tudeski.

307
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,739
- But, sir...
- Frankie, you'll let me know?

308
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,896
All right, then.

309
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,936
Mr... Mr Gogolak?

310
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,494
My wife would make my life
even more miserable than it already is

311
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,929
if I didn't at least ask.

312
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,009
Is there gonna be any kind
of finder's fee for this?

313
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,731
Finder's fee?

314
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,491
I tell you what.
Tell your wife we'll work somethin' out.

315
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,891
Cynthia, don't rush off.
We should chat a little.

316
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,130
I'll call you in the morning.
We'll leave first thing.

317
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,656
Doctor. You're not gonna do anything stupid
like try leaving me in the lurch, are you?

318
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,293
No.

319
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,253
- Who did you talk to?
- What are you talking about?

320
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,531
- You know Frankie Figs?
- I know of him.

321
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,970
Yeah, well, when I came back from lunch,
he was sitting in my room!

322
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,536
- Frankie Figs was in your room?!
- And he knew all about my knowing

323
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,810
- where Jimmy the Tulip is!
- What did he do?

324
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,252
After he played congas on my kidneys,
he took me to see Janni Gogolak.

325
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,055
- Oz, tell me you're kidding me.
- Who did you tell? I wanna know who!

326
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,535
- No one. I swear.
- Well, then, how...

327
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,577
What am I gonna do?
I'll talk to you later. I gotta go.

328
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,417
- Room service.
- This is Dr Oseransky in room 519.

329
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,657
I'm gonna need a bigger bottle of Scotch.

330
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,215
- Yeah?
- It's me.

331
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,615
Oz! How ya doin'?

332
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,935
What do I do? I've done something terrible!

333
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,689
- What could be so terrible?
- You've gotta get out of town, out of Canada.

334
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,052
- Just get the hell out. I'm in Chicago.
- Yeah. I heard about that.

335
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,175
Have you seen Janni yet?

336
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,579
- How did you know that?
- Relax.

337
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,254
I know about the whole thing.
OK? Don't worry.

338
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,896
- But...
- I'll explain everything when you get back.

339
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,571
In the meantime, why don't you have a good
time while you're down there? Live it up.

340
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,736
We'll talk when you get back.

341
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,293
If you say so, Jim.

342
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,695
Are you gonna invite me in or do I go down
and tell Janni's guys you're being impolite?

343
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,856
Janni's guys are downstairs?

344
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,176
Yes. Come in.

345
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,656
I love a man with manners.

346
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,979
Janni sent me to see if you were on the level.
Janni's the trusting type.

347
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,615
- So, do you or don't you?
- Do I or don't I...

348
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,453
Know where my wayward husband is?

349
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,450
- Mrs Tudeski...
- Cynthia. The woman you're about to widow.

350
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,969
- You don't understand.
- What's not to understand?

351
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,136
You want your 30 pieces of silver, right?

352
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,218
My only question is
why didn't you just do the job yourself?

353
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,333
- Why didn't I...
- Kill Jimmy and collect on the contract?

354
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,532
What's the matter?
You didn't have the stomach for it?

355
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,852
Or is your problem a little further... south?

356
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,617
- Have you vomited recently?
- Yes. I was gonna brush my teeth.

357
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,378
- I'll wait.
- OK.

358
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,448
Mrs Tudeski...
Cynthia, none of this was my idea.

359
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,538
You just happened
to travel 1,000 miles to rat Jimmy out.

360
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,448
That's what I'm trying to say.
It wasn't my idea. It was my wife's plan.

361
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,572
She wanted me to come to Chicago
and rat Jimmy out.

362
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,214
Maybe it would be best if you just went
back to Janni and said that I'm crazy.

363
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,731
That I've gone nuts. I'm chemically
imbalanced, you know. I'm wacko.

364
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,810
Maybe that would be the best thing.

365
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,896
Because...

366
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,777
Tell him I'm acting
exactly the way I'm acting right now.

367
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,812
But you do know where Jimmy is, don't you?

368
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,497
Look, Mrs Tudeski,
I don't want anybody to die.

369
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,129
And that is on the level.

370
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,209
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

371
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,535
I just want this all to end.

372
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,495
I am so damned scared.

373
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,769
That's room service.
Before I vomited, I ordered Scotch.

374
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,410
There you go. Thank you.

375
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,055
What would you say to a drink?

376
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,179
I'd say no ice, no water, in a tall glass.

377
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,696
What can I say? I was young.
Jimmy was like no man I'd ever met before.

378
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,013
Yeah, well, he's the first killer I've known.

379
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,734
There was no one like him
at my daddy's country club.

380
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,658
Lousy husband, though.
Cheated on me constantly.

381
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,334
- So why don't you just...
- Divorce him?

382
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,855
Jimmy doesn't believe in divorce.
Thinks it's a sin.

383
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,448
I know. A hit man with morals. Go figure!

384
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,209
So now that he's out of prison...
are you guys gonna get back together?

385
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,776
You mean assuming Frankie
and Janni don't kill him first?

386
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,133
No.

387
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,216
Jimmy and I are over.

388
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,332
Even if I wanted to make
another go of it, which I don't,

389
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,372
there'd always be
that other thing between us.

390
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,456
What other thing?

391
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,738
- The fact that he wants to kill me.
- Why?

392
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,810
You're a sweet guy. Money.

393
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,569
Oh! Are you... Are you rich?

394
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,976
The money Lazlo Gogolak
gave us as a wedding present.

395
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,220
Only it wasn't a present. Lazlo was parking
the money with us to hide it from the feds.

396
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,093
- How much was it?
- Ten million dollars.

397
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,338
- Helluva parking space.
- The only way to get the money

398
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,658
was if Jimmy and Janni and I
all signed for it together.

399
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,614
If you didn't have all three signatures,
you'd need two signatures...

400
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,696
and a death certificate.

401
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,337
- Or one signature and...
- Two death certificates.

402
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,816
- So if Jimmy kills you...
- And Janni. Let's not forget about Janni.

403
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,569
- Then he gets the money. All of it.
- The whole nine yards.

404
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,337
What if you just told him
you didn't want the money?

405
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,574
I did tell him. I don't want a dime.

406
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,211
But he knows I don't wanna be
married to him and he won't divorce.

407
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,093
- But murder, he's OK with?
- It's what he does.

408
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,813
If it was me, ten million wouldn't be enough.

409
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,489
So how much would it take
for you to kill your wife?

410
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,929
- I'm talking about you.
- Me, then. How much?

411
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,451
That's what I'm saying. I think you are
the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

412
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,971
- I cannot believe I am saying this out loud.
- I'm sure that's just the Scotch talking.

413
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,056
No, it's me.

414
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,978
I've spent the last seven years just
sitting and waiting for something to happen.

415
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,534
I didn't even know what it was...

416
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,535
until you walked in that room
at Janni Gogolak's house.

417
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,813
- I'm sorry. I've embarrassed you.
- I should go.

418
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,896
- No.
- Please.

419
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,177
You're a nice guy... but I've gotta go.

420
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,056
Let's go.

421
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,058
You know the night's still young.
You boys in any rush to get back?

422
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,458
Did you mean what you said?

423
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,815
I've got till midnight.

424
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,896
In the meantime...

425
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,176
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

426
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,939
You'll go slow.
I haven't made love in five years.

427
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,654
Neither have I.

428
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,135
I've been married.

429
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,976
It's almost time.

430
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,054
Again? What did you have,
oysters for lunch?

431
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,136
Actually, I did.

432
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,936
Jimmy knows I'm here.

433
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,655
- Here with me?
- Here in Chicago, talking with Janni.

434
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,371
- How? How did he know that?
- Because I told him.

435
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,536
- You what?
- He already knew.

436
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,090
- How?
- I'm guessing my darling wife.

437
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,008
- Is she trying to get you killed?
- Apparently! That's all I can come up with.

438
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,975
But when I talked to Jimmy...
he didn't sound upset.

439
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,332
No, he wouldn't. He'd be your best friend
right up until the moment he...

440
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,893
He's gonna kill me, isn't he?

441
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,932
Then, when he's done with that,
he's gonna come after you.

442
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,052
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I'm not gonna let Jimmy kill you.

443
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,740
I'm gonna take Frankie to Canada
and lead him to Jimmy.

444
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,899
- So Frankie can kill him.
- I don't like it, but better Jimmy than you.

445
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,818
Oz, don't you get it? Either way, I'm dead.

446
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,776
- Why? W-Why?
- When Jimmy's dead,

447
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,255
why would Janni wanna keep me alive?

448
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,056
- He'd wanna kill me too...
- So he can collect on the ten million dollars.

449
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,010
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.

450
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,813
I swear I am not gonna let anybody kill you.

451
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,654
Under the circumstances, that's
the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

452
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,736
Thanks.

453
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,012
You what? You told Jimmy?

454
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,096
What the hell did you do that for?

455
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,132
I felt bad. I like him. I liked him.

456
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,809
- So you don't like him no more?
- It's sort of hard if he wants to kill you.

457
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,933
If you sold my ass out to Janni then told
me about it, I'd wanna ice your ass too.

458
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,016
I know.

459
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,770
- I can close that gap for you.
- Really?

460
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,972
- Yeah, you'd be in and out.
- You're kiddin'? This thing here?

461
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,939
So, did you do it?
Did you do what I told you to do?

462
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,337
- No, no. I'm not gonna answer that!
- So you did?!

463
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,498
- I can tell. You had sex!
- Full-size car, please!

464
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,259
- Who is she? I wanna hear all about it!
- I gotta go.

465
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,168
- Any emergencies, I've got my beeper on.
- OK, fine. Be that way.

466
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,179
The hell bitch called. She and her mom
went to Niagara Falls for a couple of days.

467
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,939
Probably workin' on her alibi. I gotta go.

468
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,569
Why don't you drive back
to the hotel with me?

469
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,332
Unless, of course, you'd rather go home in
broad daylight with Jimmy right next door?

470
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,416
Yeah, I'll go with you.

471
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,934
Frankie Figs.

472
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,456
Jimmy T.

473
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,260
What's goin' on, man? What's up, baby?

474
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,935
So, Frankie! Welcome to Montreal.

475
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,779
- What's up, partner?
- You're looking good!

476
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,895
- Oz, you look worried. Doesn't he, Frankie?
- He does, man.

477
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,889
Why don't you relax? Come on! Frankie
told me what a stand-up guy you've been.

478
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,413
Now change your pants. We're goin' out.

479
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,011
C'est une chanson

480
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,410
Qui nous ressemble

481
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,496
Toi, qui m'aimais

482
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,815
Moi, qui t'aimais

483
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,936
Et nous vivions

484
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,535
Tous les deux ensemble...

485
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,734
I'm gonna keep the coke and the fries,
but I'm gonna send this burger back.

486
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,898
If you put any mayonnaise on it, I'm gonna
come over your house, chop your legs off,

487
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,855
set your house on fire, and watch as you drag
your bloody stumps outta your house. OK?

488
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,538
Pierre?

489
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,252
I'm fine.

490
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,496
You're fine?

491
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,460
Let me tell you somethin', Oz. You are not
fine. You know your wife wants you dead?

492
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,775
That much I've figured out.

493
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,937
I thought you should know.
I'm not the first one she came to.

494
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,379
- The first...
- Hitter.

495
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,297
- There were others?
- At least one.

496
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,412
Apparently, that fell through
so she came to me.

497
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,455
What did you tell her?

498
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,700
You mean did I... take the contract?

499
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,855
No. I didn't take the contract.

500
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,175
- How much did she offer you?
- Ten grand.

501
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,974
No wonder you turned her down!

502
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,177
But you did turn her down?
Even though I went to Janni?

503
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,088
You didn't go to Janni.
Jimmy sent me to come to you.

504
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,735
I know that Frankie can be very persuasive.

505
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,852
- By the way, how's your urination?
- Fine, thank you.

506
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,971
So why did you want me to go see Janni?

507
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:03,053
- So you could tell him where I was.
- So he'd come here and you could kill him?

508
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,293
Exacto! By the way...
I'd be happy to do your wife for you.

509
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,853
- Do my wife?
- Tap her.

510
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,095
- Whack her.
- Whack her?

511
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,495
Oh! Oh, see, I thought you meant...

512
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,456
Cos she told me that you...
you know, hit on her.

513
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,735
That's funny.

514
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,896
Why is that funny?

515
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:32,053
Actually, I wasn't gonna tell you this,
but... the truth is, your wife came on to me.

516
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,494
- And?
- Oz... we're friends.

517
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,454
Friends do not engage in sexual congress
with each other's wives.

518
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,331
Besides... I don't find your wife
particularly that attractive.

519
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,291
You just got out of prison.

520
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,459
You've been in prison for five years
and you don't find my wife attractive?

521
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,935
She's not a good person.

522
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,291
You've killed 17 people... and you
don't think my wife is a good person?

523
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,090
It's not important
how many people I've killed.

524
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,856
What's important... is how I get along
with the people that are still alive.

525
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,740
- You gonna finish this?
- Just take it.

526
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:28,129
Les pas des amants

527
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:36,049
Désunis

528
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,736
I think we've given it long enough.

529
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,897
Give Janni a call.
The sooner he gets here, the better.

530
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,818
After you kill Janni,
are you gonna go back to Chicago?

531
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,817
No. I've done with Chicago.

532
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,933
What about your wife?
Are you gonna get back together with her?

533
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,172
- You're gonna kill her too?
- For a helluva lot more than 10,000 dollars!

534
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,495
- Well, you can't do that!
- Why not?

535
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,576
Because she's your wife!

536
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,851
Jimmy, you were right about him.
He's an exceedingly sweet man.

537
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,653
Wife like he got
and still he believes in weddin' vows!

538
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,738
So do I. Especially "Till death do us part."

539
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,018
It's my beeper. I gotta go to the office.

540
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,495
Well, wedding vows or not...

541
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,492
I'd watch my back.

542
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,453
I'd say your wife's still shoppin' for a hitter.

543
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,536
Good luck.

544
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,576
You know what? On second thought,
I think we're gonna have to pull the tooth.

545
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,060
Oz! What is it? What's the matter?

546
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,016
Oh, no! Oz, no! I'll take that!

547
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,096
Oz!

548
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,616
- I am your friend. Talk to me.
- I have to talk to somebody

549
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,573
- because I'm gonna do something...
- Take your time.

550
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,011
That's good.

551
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,019
First of all, I just found out
that my wife is trying to have me killed.

552
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,096
- Who told you?
- A friend.

553
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,654
- Anyone I know?
- He's my next-door neighbour.

554
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,453
And here's the funny part. He's a hit man too!

555
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,414
- Really? What's his name?
- Jimmy. Jimmy Tudeski.

556
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,451
Jimmy the Tulip?

557
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,652
Jimmy the Tulip lives next to you?
And you know him?!

558
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,135
Oz, can you introduce me to him?

559
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,491
Jill... The man's a professional killer.

560
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,011
Oz, I've been wanting to meet this guy
for years. Please, Oz. Come on!

561
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,330
Oh, Oz!

562
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,212
Quick, come on!

563
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,931
- What's this, Oz?
- I dunno.

564
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,453
It is you. Mr Tudeski, you don't understand.
I'm one of your biggest fans.

565
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:38,938
I've followed your career since I was a kid.
That's why I'm trying to get into the business.

566
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,249
- What business would that be?
- Contract killing. It's what I wanna do.

567
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,249
If I could just have one afternoon of your
time, I know I could learn so much from you.

568
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,736
So come in.

569
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,736
You too.

570
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,855
What's all this?

571
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,210
- How do you know her?
- She's my assistant.

572
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,138
- Did you know she was a hitter?
- I'm still a virgin.

573
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,774
I haven't killed anyone yet, professionally.

574
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,856
- Oz was gonna be my first.
- Excuse me?

575
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,732
- His wife hired me.
- That was you?

576
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,251
It was supposed to look like an accident, so
I went to work for him to identify his habits.

577
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,336
- Good. Smart.
- Thanks.

578
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,499
But then after I got to know him,
I... started to like him.

579
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,451
- First mistake.
- I know!

580
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,333
You should get close, but not too close.

581
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,419
- Oz, why don't you pour yourself a martini?
- It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

582
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,856
I'll...

583
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,493
Don't give yourself a hard time.
You've got your whole career ahead.

584
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,010
I remember when I was first startin' out,
I hadn't done that much.

585
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,577
I'd done some things, saw some money, was
having fun. I was doing somethin' I liked.

586
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,136
And I was recruited by Lazlo Gogolak.

587
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,252
He wanted me to whack out
one of his little cousins.

588
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,214
- Is this the Stanley Posilansky incident?
- Yeah.

589
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,571
Anyway, Lazlo doesn't want it
to look like a hit.

590
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:16,730
So I've gotta get close to Stanley, who was
this really charming, cute, funny little guy.

591
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,613
Very weird sense of humour. Made me laugh.

592
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,773
I really liked him as a person.
You know what I mean?

593
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,856
You got too close.

594
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,456
Yeah. I got too close.

595
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,175
Moment of truth comes... I choked.

596
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,650
- Him?
- Me. I choked.

597
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,056
I couldn't do it. I actually...

598
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,016
I told him I was there to kill him.

599
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,258
I said "Run, Stanley, run!
Go, go! Run, hide. Off you go."

600
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,974
We shake hands, part as friends.

601
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,330
I turn around to walk away...
and that weasel shoots me in the back.

602
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,974
The bullet comes out right here.

603
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,970
- So what did you do?
- I didn't really like Stanley after that.

604
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,817
He took a really... really long time to die.

605
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,296
And this scar's a reminder.
Never get too close.

606
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,089
Excuse me!

607
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,056
Excuse me!

608
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,971
Not to interrupt or anything, but you
were gonna kill me? That was the plan?

609
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,933
- What are you doin' tonight?
- No plans.

610
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,974
Wanna help us out? Me and Frankie Figs.

611
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,738
Wait. Are you offering me ajob?

612
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,171
Only if you're interested.

613
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,329
It would be an honour.
It would be like a dream come true!

614
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,615
- Who's the mark?
- Janni Gogo.

615
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,054
Janni Gogo?

616
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,092
Feel my arm. Goose bumps!

617
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,176
Phone!

618
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,971
The phone scared me.

619
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,056
There it is again!

620
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,857
- What is wrong with you?
- I dunno.

621
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,936
Yeah. Frankie.

622
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,056
OK, good. See you soon.

623
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,656
- Good news?
- Great news.

624
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,815
Apparently Janni Gogo is on his way
up here and... bringing my wife with him.

625
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,579
- Your wife?
- Your... He's got... Why?

626
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,658
Janni figures he'll take care of her
when he takes care of me.

627
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:52,217
- So what are you gonna do? Try to save her?
- No. I want her dead, too.

628
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,088
- Really?
- Yeah. You got a problem with it?

629
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,496
- Why would I? It's not like I know her.
- I can't believe you people!

630
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,818
Here you are, calmly talking about
the murder of a beautiful, innocent woman,

631
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,659
whose only crime
is that she married you, Jimmy,

632
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,772
so I'm not gonna listen to this any more.

633
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,289
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna...

634
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,092
I'm gonna...

635
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,176
I'm gonna go!

636
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,818
All right!

637
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,896
Does this slide? What?

638
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:57,365
Answer that.

639
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:03,604
That's my phone, thank you.

640
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:08,405
Hello?

641
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:12,005
- Well, who was it?
- They hung up.

642
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:16,327
- Expecting a call?
- Explain how that's any of your business.

643
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:20,044
Get her bag. The plane's waiting and I'm not.

644
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:59,244
Oh, my God.

645
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:09,558
- You don't like the Walther?
- Go with what you're comfortable with.

646
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:11,520
- It's what James Bond uses.
- Really?

647
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:13,526
- Yeah.
- Still, I'd like...

648
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:31,002
Is there any way
I can stop you from doing this?

649
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:35,407
Oz, will you relax? I promise you, no one
will know you had anything to do with this.

650
00:53:35,529 --> 00:53:37,599
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

651
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:39,799
You're still gonna kill your wife!

652
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:42,205
Well...

653
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:44,717
yeah!

654
00:53:45,649 --> 00:53:48,402
I've got a very good reason to kill my wife.

655
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:52,921
I've got ten million
very good reasons to kill my wife.

656
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:55,165
OK, well... what if I said no?

657
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:59,684
You know, what if I said
I wasn't gonna let you do it?

658
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:07,121
You are the most chivalrous guy
I have ever met in my life.

659
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:10,525
- Do you see why I couldn't kill him?
- I love him.

660
00:54:10,649 --> 00:54:12,605
Oz... come on.

661
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:18,164
You relax. Come on over here, sit down in
your favourite chair. Have another martini.

662
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:23,888
Listen to me. Tonight is gonna happen,
whether you want it to or not.

663
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:26,648
- And... you're gonna help.
- Me? Help?

664
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:31,285
Yeah. You, help. You're gonna help.
You're gonna go with Frankie to meet Janni.

665
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:33,764
If you're not there, Janni will get suspicious,

666
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:37,199
get back on the plane and fly back
to Chicago, and we don't want that.

667
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:39,365
- Jimmy.
- Oz.

668
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:41,798
This is the way it's gotta be, OK?

669
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:43,885
And...

670
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:48,681
I'm tellin' you this like a friend
because... if you screw this up,

671
00:54:49,609 --> 00:54:51,839
I would hate to...

672
00:54:54,009 --> 00:54:56,364
I would really hate to have to kill you.

673
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:59,887
I would hate it.
I'd hate it more than mayonnaise.

674
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:02,398
- You know how much I hate mayonnaise.
- Yes, I do.

675
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:04,963
And trust me, you want Janni Gogolak dead.

676
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:08,047
That's where you're wrong.
I don't want anybody dead.

677
00:55:08,169 --> 00:55:11,639
Well, if we don't make Janni Gogolak dead,
he's gonna make you dead.

678
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:15,557
- The Gogolaks don't leave witnesses around.
- Oh, so now...

679
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:19,887
Damn it, Jimmy! Why the hell did
you have to go and move in next door to me?

680
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:24,161
Oz, do you know what kind of soil
they have in this back yard?

681
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:27,725
- After two days, I've got little tomato plants...
- Oh, my God!

682
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:33,158
Yes! Yes! Yes!

683
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,803
Yes... Yes! Yes!

684
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:39,918
- Why did you stop?
- Are you doing it tonight?

685
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:43,439
- Tonight, whenever. Kick it into gear!
- For 10,000?

686
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:46,647
Wait a minute.
You said we were doin' this for 15.

687
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:50,842
I changed my mind. But if you think
I should try to find somebody else, I can...

688
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:53,324
No, no, no, no.

689
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:56,759
Listen, why don't we make it... 12,500?

690
00:55:57,649 --> 00:56:00,686
I can live with 12,500.
As long as my husband doesn't.

691
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:03,283
He won't. I promise.

692
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,120
- You must be...
- Jill St Clair.

693
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:11,686
And can I just say, Mr Figueroa,
that I think the job you did on Kevin Vincent,

694
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:16,837
that and the Ronald Abramson hit,
they were both just... They were works of art.

695
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:20,484
- I see you've done your homework.
- Well, I keep a scrapbook.

696
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:22,679
- Frankie!
- What's up, man?

697
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:26,040
Honey, why don't you go get Oz?
I wanna run through this again,

698
00:56:26,169 --> 00:56:28,160
make sure we know what we're doing.

699
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:33,239
- Cute kid.
- Got definite potential.

700
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:45,447
Time to rock and roll.

701
00:57:43,249 --> 00:57:44,887
I got this same car.

702
00:57:45,009 --> 00:57:46,965
- Really?
- No.

703
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:12,325
All right, nobody move.

704
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:17,320
Everybody quiet.

705
00:58:39,969 --> 00:58:42,358
God, I'm gonna love this.

706
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:45,003
So... now what?

707
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:47,359
Now we wait until...

708
00:58:50,689 --> 00:58:53,487
- he's asleep.
- OK.

709
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:24,327
Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

710
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:26,405
Let's get started.

711
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:49,845
We got company.

712
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:59,005
- Anybody we know?
- Oz's wife and some guy.

713
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,646
Probably your replacement. The new hitter.

714
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:06,322
Well, nothing we can do about it now.

715
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:08,679
- Keep an eye on 'em.
- OK.

716
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:10,800
Love those pants on you.

717
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:15,408
- So what is he, a bad guy, your husband?
- No.

718
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,248
Actually, everyone seems to like him.

719
01:00:19,009 --> 01:00:22,126
Which might be the thing
I hate most about him.

720
01:00:22,249 --> 01:00:25,321
- So let's go over this one more time.
- What the hell for?

721
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:28,009
I just wanna make sure
we got everything right.

722
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:30,518
Is there any particular way
you want him to die?

723
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:35,245
What do I care? I'm out of the country.
Shopping for my funeral dress.

724
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:40,449
Dentist... get the blinds.

725
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:46,485
Today!

726
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:07,238
Oh, God! Of all the times...

727
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:13,362
You're married, right?
Does your wife have any...

728
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:16,642
Feminine products! Yes. Yes, she does.

729
01:01:16,769 --> 01:01:20,398
They're right through there.
I'll show you where they are.

730
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:24,563
- Don't b' long.
- Don't blong?

731
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:26,645
- Don't be long.
- Gotcha.

732
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:31,804
You make a little noise, he gets out
of bed to see what the problem is

733
01:01:32,049 --> 01:01:34,085
and you make him dead! OK?

734
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:36,279
- You understand me?
- The dead part?

735
01:01:36,409 --> 01:01:39,242
Ransack the house a bit
so it looks like a bad burglary.

736
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:44,489
And you get your ass back in this car,
and we drive like hell back to Niagara Falls.

737
01:01:44,689 --> 01:01:47,203
Where you're gonna pay me
my other 5,000 dollars?

738
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:49,963
My mother's there waiting with it.

739
01:01:50,089 --> 01:01:52,205
Your mother, she knows about this?

740
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:55,008
My mother wants this to happen
as much as I do.

741
01:01:55,809 --> 01:01:58,403
And I really, really want this to happen.

742
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:03,358
- They're gonna kill you!
- What?

743
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:07,482
When they're done with Jimmy, Janni's
gonna come after you. I came to warn you.

744
01:02:07,609 --> 01:02:09,361
Oh, that is...

745
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:14,563
Janni won't kill anyone.
Jimmy's waiting for them.

746
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,078
- So Jimmy...
- Jimmy and Frankie, they're in...

747
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:18,244
- Cahoots.
- Right.

748
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:21,486
- And you? Are you cahooting with them?
- I had to pretend I was.

749
01:02:21,609 --> 01:02:23,964
But, listen... I have a plan.

750
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,928
It's time. You two stay here.

751
01:02:39,569 --> 01:02:41,924
Hey. You know these guys?

752
01:02:44,089 --> 01:02:45,522
No.

753
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:47,685
Who is that?

754
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:54,088
- Is that Janni Gogolak?
- From the Gogolak gang.

755
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:57,406
It might be. The guy they call
Jimmy the Tulip lives next door.

756
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:02,078
Jimmy the Tulip. Damn!
This is a hit. Stay right here.

757
01:03:14,049 --> 01:03:16,404
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

758
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:20,283
You smell great!

759
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:24,165
Shoot!

760
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:29,158
- You got a gun now. Gonna use it or not?
- Kill him, Major.

761
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:33,840
Yeah, kill him, Major. Go ahead!
Show him how you're not afraid to die!

762
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:35,925
Shoot!

763
01:03:43,449 --> 01:03:45,804
Looks like you don't want it enough.

764
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:52,447
You should laugh when
something's funny for a change.

765
01:03:52,569 --> 01:03:56,164
One rock or more or less isn't worth dying for.

766
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,523
Hi. Are you guys looking for someone?

767
01:04:19,129 --> 01:04:20,562
Hi, Janni.

768
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:22,765
Watch your head!

769
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:41,405
You know, this whole sneakin'-into-the-house
thing to try to kill me?

770
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:44,563
You guys are really good! You really...

771
01:04:45,529 --> 01:04:47,759
Goodbye, Janni.

772
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:14,318
- What's goin' on?
- Oz took off with your wife.

773
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:18,965
- And Sophie's hitter's right outside.
- All right. I'll take care of it.

774
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:20,602
You should get dressed.

775
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:23,562
You know what? Better yet, stay just like that.

776
01:05:23,689 --> 01:05:26,408
In 60 seconds,
stick your head out that window.

777
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:30,565
Hey.

778
01:05:31,009 --> 01:05:34,046
- Nice work.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

779
01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:38,319
Be right back.

780
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:42,965
You know, I can't think of nothin' finer
than a fine naked woman holdin' a gun.

781
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:46,001
And you just all kinds of fine, ain't you?

782
01:05:46,129 --> 01:05:48,085
Don't get any ideas.

783
01:05:49,769 --> 01:05:51,885
A seriously sweet ass.

784
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,245
Can I help you?

785
01:06:15,649 --> 01:06:18,038
Now you can get dressed.

786
01:06:33,009 --> 01:06:35,967
- Where do you want this?
- Just put it over there.

787
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:45,769
What was Oz doin'
goin' off with my wife like that?

788
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:48,926
- I can beep him. You can ask him.
- Beep him.

789
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:51,441
Now ain't this some shit?

790
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:59,087
All right, maybe he won't come after us.
Maybe he'll just let us go.

791
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:02,997
OK. Maybe I can talk to him.
Reason with him. We're friends now, right?

792
01:07:03,129 --> 01:07:07,008
- That's what Harry Lefkowitz thought.
- What happened to him?

793
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,918
I don't wanna know what happened to him.

794
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:15,559
It's your beeper.

795
01:07:15,689 --> 01:07:17,645
I know.

796
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:20,805
It's Jimmy.

797
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:23,164
Jimmy, it's me.

798
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:29,124
Oz, what the hell were you thinkin',
takin' off with Cynthia?

799
01:07:29,249 --> 01:07:32,446
I'm sorry. But I can't let you kill her.

800
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:36,278
What do you mean?
That's got nothin' to do with you!

801
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:38,764
Jimmy, I'm in love with her.

802
01:07:39,729 --> 01:07:41,879
Look. I...

803
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:46,484
- What did you just say?
- I love her.

804
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:53,886
What are you talkin' about, you love her?
You just met her!

805
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:56,204
- He said he's in love with Cynthia.
- No shit!

806
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:58,445
- So she's the one!
- She's the one what?

807
01:07:58,569 --> 01:08:01,527
- The one he schtupped in Chicago!
- The one he...

808
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:05,245
My wife.

809
01:08:06,689 --> 01:08:08,725
You schtupped my wife, Oz?

810
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:13,327
I wouldn't exactly necessarily
phrase it that way, exactly.

811
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:18,159
No, wait, wait! You went to Chicago and
engaged in sexual congress with my wife?

812
01:08:18,289 --> 01:08:20,245
Is that what you're telling me?

813
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:22,325
- Is that it? Is...
- Jimmy, calm down.

814
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:24,201
I swear to God...

815
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:27,799
He's a little upset.
I've managed to upset a mass murderer.

816
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:32,043
Find out where he is. Just stay right there.

817
01:08:32,329 --> 01:08:35,765
- Oz, you stud, you!
- Gonna be a dead stud.

818
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:40,002
Tell Jimmy I might have thought
of a win-win way out of this.

819
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:42,438
I know you got a couple
of bodies lying around.

820
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:44,924
Yeah, and get this. One of 'em's a cop.

821
01:08:45,929 --> 01:08:48,489
What's he sayin'? What's he sayin'?!

822
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:52,169
Tell him to stay where he is
and I'll be right there.

823
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:55,998
That sounds great. I'm gonna run it
by the boys and I'll beep you right back.

824
01:08:56,129 --> 01:08:58,324
OK. Bye.

825
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:04,361
Jimmy, when was the last time
you went to the dentist?

826
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:09,080
You really meant it, didn't you?

827
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:11,165
What you said.

828
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:16,568
About what? Loving you? Of course!
What did you think this was all about?

829
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:18,441
Sex.

830
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:21,606
- I mean great sex, but...
- It was pretty good.

831
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:27,284
Is that all this has meant to you?

832
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:30,879
Don't get me wrong, Oz. I like you a lot.

833
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:34,485
Well, that's great to hear,
but I've got news for you.

834
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:38,807
I don't usually go round risking my life
for people thatjust like me.

835
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:44,159
Well, I do like you.

836
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:47,519
But...

837
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:52,559
Then again, who knows? Maybe...

838
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,523
Maybe this feeling I've been having
in the pit of my stomach...

839
01:09:56,969 --> 01:09:59,085
Maybe it's love.

840
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,885
It's your beeper.

841
01:10:02,009 --> 01:10:03,965
I know.

842
01:10:08,129 --> 01:10:10,484
- Yeah?
- It's me.

843
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:15,157
- I'll tell you one thing. You got balls.
- Yeah. Who knew?

844
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:17,803
Jill told me your idea.

845
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:19,248
And...

846
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:25,804
I think it's worth a try.

847
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,921
- Jimmy, thank you.
- Butjust so you know...

848
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:33,925
I am disappointed, Oz.

849
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:38,238
I am extremely disappointed with you.

850
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:41,600
You are the last person
I would ever wanna disappoint,

851
01:10:41,729 --> 01:10:44,721
but everything I did was for love.

852
01:10:46,929 --> 01:10:48,885
Yeah, whatever.

853
01:10:50,849 --> 01:10:53,443
- See you at your office.
- OK. Gimme an hour.

854
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:55,719
Oh, and don't forget the corpse!

855
01:11:05,129 --> 01:11:09,805
- Merci. Monsieur Boulez, remember to floss.
- De rien. C'est mon plaisir.

856
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:14,079
Stay on the boat. Take this.

857
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:19,124
If you don't hear from me in two hours,
just go. Disappear. Leave the country.

858
01:11:20,129 --> 01:11:22,085
Oz!

859
01:11:22,769 --> 01:11:24,725
Be careful.

860
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:30,165
I'm Mr Careful.

861
01:12:06,449 --> 01:12:09,600
Oz. I just wanted to make sure it was you.

862
01:12:10,169 --> 01:12:13,400
Everybody's inside. By the way,

863
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,201
huevos grandes, amigo!

864
01:12:22,689 --> 01:12:24,645
The great and powerful Oz.

865
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:30,404
Why don't we get started?

866
01:13:55,209 --> 01:13:56,801
So far, so good.

867
01:14:02,769 --> 01:14:04,725
- Is he up?
- Yeah, got him.

868
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:07,405
Let's see if he stays...

869
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:09,804
All right. Frankie, duct tape.

870
01:14:23,449 --> 01:14:25,246
We did it.

871
01:14:26,769 --> 01:14:28,725
Yeah, I think we're good.

872
01:14:31,169 --> 01:14:33,125
- Barbecue?
- Barbecue.

873
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:51,726
It really turned out to be a nice night tonight.

874
01:14:56,809 --> 01:14:58,765
OK. I'll be right back.

875
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:06,246
- Who's this remind you of?
- Old Charlie, baby.

876
01:15:14,929 --> 01:15:16,760
All right.

877
01:15:17,049 --> 01:15:19,005
OK!

878
01:15:50,009 --> 01:15:52,477
Doctor? These men need to see you.

879
01:15:55,089 --> 01:15:56,602
Excuse me.

880
01:15:57,089 --> 01:15:59,045
Right this way, gentlemen.

881
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:06,164
Dr Oseransky, I'm Sergeant Buchanan.
This is Officer Morrissey.

882
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:09,804
Yes, well, what can I do for you?

883
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:15,767
Are you the owner of a brown Toyota Corolla,

884
01:16:15,889 --> 01:16:19,120
licence number ZSJ 959?

885
01:16:19,369 --> 01:16:23,521
- Yes. Is there a problem?
- Do you know where your vehicle is, sir?

886
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:28,445
- I lent it to my neighbour. He went fishing.
- This neighbour. He got a name?

887
01:16:29,809 --> 01:16:31,765
Jimmy Jones.

888
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:37,166
Would you mind taking us
to his place of residence?

889
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:40,725
Your car was found
by the grain silo at the Old Port.

890
01:16:40,849 --> 01:16:45,047
- Two bodies were in it. There had been a fire.
- Oh, my God.

891
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:48,605
The extent of the burns made
normal identification impossible,

892
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,685
so dental impressions were taken.

893
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:53,369
And from the records,
we were able to establish

894
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:58,961
that the bodies were those of one Janni
Pytor Gogolak and James Stefan Tudeski.

895
01:16:59,089 --> 01:17:03,321
Both of them were big shots
in a Chicago crime syndicate.

896
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:07,122
- And you think this James...
- Tudeski.

897
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:11,642
...is the Jimmy I know?
- That's what we intend to find out.

898
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:24,525
Isn't that Hanson's car?

899
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:28,325
Go have a look.

900
01:17:30,809 --> 01:17:33,926
- Who's... who's Hanson?
- One of our men.

901
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:36,483
He was on an undercover assignment.

902
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:41,364
There was some concern earlier
because he failed to check in this morning.

903
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:57,564
Your mother, she knows about this?

904
01:17:57,689 --> 01:18:00,203
My mother wants this
to happen as much as I do.

905
01:18:00,329 --> 01:18:03,002
And I really, really want this to happen.

906
01:18:09,009 --> 01:18:12,240
It's Hanson's car all right.
But no sign of Hanson.

907
01:18:12,369 --> 01:18:14,325
But I found a tape.

908
01:18:25,929 --> 01:18:29,478
Dr Oseransky, could you tell us
where your wife might be?

909
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:33,238
My wife? She's in Niagara Falls
with her mother. Why?

910
01:18:34,489 --> 01:18:36,923
I don't know how to tell you this,

911
01:18:37,049 --> 01:18:41,565
but it seems that your wife recently
tried to hire a hit man to kill you.

912
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:43,884
A hit man?

913
01:18:44,089 --> 01:18:45,283
Oh, my God!

914
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:54,964
There's no smoking in here.

915
01:19:01,969 --> 01:19:04,199
So where is he, Mrs Oseransky?

916
01:19:04,329 --> 01:19:07,799
...questions and you better have answers!
- Hi, Mom!

917
01:19:09,849 --> 01:19:13,159
You can ask me questions,
but until I speak to my attorney...

918
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:17,077
You spoke to him.
He doesn't want anything to do with you!

919
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:20,719
Special Agent Hanson, Mrs Oseransky.
What did you do to him?

920
01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:23,488
- Wasn't me.
- We have your voice on tape!

921
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:29,162
His written reports! We know you tried to hire
him to kill your husband. So what happened?

922
01:19:29,289 --> 01:19:33,680
Did he try to back out?
He tried to back out and you killed him.

923
01:19:33,809 --> 01:19:37,006
None of this would have happened
if that girl had done herjob!

924
01:19:37,129 --> 01:19:38,960
- What girl?
- Jill!

925
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:41,478
My husband's receptionist.

926
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:46,763
- Oh, yeah? Well, is she a contract killer, too?
- Yes! I hired her! She's the killer.

927
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,323
This would be sad if it wasn't so pathetic.

928
01:19:56,449 --> 01:19:58,565
Do you wanna talk to her?

929
01:19:58,689 --> 01:20:01,408
No. No, I don't think so.

930
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:03,485
Mm. I don't blame you.

931
01:20:04,369 --> 01:20:06,883
You guys know a good divorce lawyer?

932
01:20:07,009 --> 01:20:10,399
She did it! She's a killer!
You've got to believe me!

933
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:20,441
Don't worry. I got all the i's dotted
and all the t's crossed.

934
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:25,245
- Jimmy's got his own way of spelling.
- I will take care of him. You needn't see him.

935
01:20:25,369 --> 01:20:28,725
You and Jill go to the bank.
Jimmy and I'll be at the fine-art museum.

936
01:20:28,849 --> 01:20:32,285
- Jimmy at a fine-art museum?
- There's people at a fine-art museum.

937
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:36,641
- He's not gonna try anything.
- All right. If you say so.

938
01:20:48,689 --> 01:20:50,645
Where's Cynthia?

939
01:20:52,009 --> 01:20:53,965
You and I are leaving.

940
01:20:58,169 --> 01:21:01,878
I'll beep Cynthia. She'll call you
on that phone and tell you where to go.

941
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:04,279
Listen to him. Mr Cloak-and-Dagger!

942
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:07,687
- I'm being careful. I'm a dentist.
- Yeah.

943
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:14,805
You boys play nice, now.

944
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:21,918
Take us to the art museum.

945
01:21:22,889 --> 01:21:28,168
You think if Cynthia doesn't come through,
you're gonna be any safer at the art museum?

946
01:21:40,649 --> 01:21:42,605
Hello.

947
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:45,726
Yeah. Yeah.

948
01:21:46,009 --> 01:21:49,558
I hope there was nothing special
you wanted to see at the art museum.

949
01:21:49,689 --> 01:21:52,078
- Why?
- Cos we're not going to the art museum.

950
01:21:52,209 --> 01:21:54,086
We're going to the marina.

951
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,120
- The marina?
- Yeah.

952
01:21:56,249 --> 01:21:58,479
I rented a boat for the day.

953
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:00,645
Ain't that right, Frankie?

954
01:22:05,809 --> 01:22:09,358
See? I'm careful, too.

955
01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:51,645
You're Jill?

956
01:22:52,809 --> 01:22:54,765
Nice to meet you.

957
01:22:55,569 --> 01:22:59,198
- Where's your gun?
- What makes you think I have a gun?

958
01:23:11,129 --> 01:23:13,085
Throw it in.

959
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,644
Do you have the certificates?

960
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:24,645
Let's go banking.

961
01:23:29,529 --> 01:23:31,520
Everything seems to be in order.

962
01:23:31,649 --> 01:23:35,324
- Where would you like the money sent?
- To a bank in the Caymans.

963
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:37,963
- The account number is 0...
- Can we have a minute?

964
01:23:38,089 --> 01:23:39,807
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

965
01:23:39,929 --> 01:23:41,885
I'll be right over there.

966
01:23:49,169 --> 01:23:52,479
We could just walk away, you know.
You and me.

967
01:23:53,089 --> 01:23:55,045
With the whole ten million.

968
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,724
So? What do you think?

969
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:10,160
I think...

970
01:24:10,289 --> 01:24:14,282
- I know that if we did, Jimmy would kill Oz.
- So what?

971
01:24:20,809 --> 01:24:24,438
- You're a lucky guy, Oz.
- Why would you say that?

972
01:24:25,209 --> 01:24:29,327
You're about to find out
if the woman you love really loves you.

973
01:24:29,449 --> 01:24:31,121
Want a beer?

974
01:24:31,889 --> 01:24:34,323
If it was me, if I was in her position,

975
01:24:35,649 --> 01:24:38,209
I'd just take the money and run.

976
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:42,325
So what are you bettin' on?

977
01:24:42,929 --> 01:24:45,363
I'm betting on love.

978
01:24:45,489 --> 01:24:51,678
Love for you means money for me. And like I
said before, I'd really hate to have to kill you.

979
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:09,680
- So when are you gonna do it?
- Let's just make sure we got the money first.

980
01:25:11,929 --> 01:25:14,284
But you are intendin' to kill him?

981
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:22,200
Jimmy, listen. He was there! He was there
when you killed Janni and a cop!

982
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:24,889
Now, I know you like this guy...

983
01:25:25,489 --> 01:25:28,481
- Yeah. I do.
- But he's got to go.

984
01:25:29,049 --> 01:25:33,520
- And if you ain't prepared to do it, then I...
- Hey, Frankie, Frankie!

985
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:36,288
Let's not forget who you're talking to, OK?

986
01:25:37,849 --> 01:25:39,919
Jimmy Tudeski may be dead,

987
01:25:40,049 --> 01:25:42,643
but he ain't exactly dead. Understand?

988
01:25:44,289 --> 01:25:48,248
- Glad to hear it.
- Just drive the boat.

989
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:57,120
Think about it, Cynthia. We're talking
about five million dollars apiece here.

990
01:25:57,249 --> 01:26:00,207
Is Oz really worth that much to you?

991
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:03,805
The thing is... is...

992
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:08,289
- I think I love him.
- You think? You think?

993
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:12,408
Sweetheart, for five million dollars,
you better be damn certain!

994
01:26:14,849 --> 01:26:16,680
I am.

995
01:26:16,809 --> 01:26:20,484
I'm sorry, but I... I love him.

996
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:24,688
You do? That's the right answer.

997
01:26:25,369 --> 01:26:27,599
Yo, guy! You can get back here now.

998
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:35,565
Yeah?

999
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:37,645
Yeah.

1000
01:26:39,009 --> 01:26:41,159
OK.

1001
01:26:42,529 --> 01:26:44,485
OK.

1002
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:48,325
We got the money.

1003
01:26:52,969 --> 01:26:54,721
Bye-bye, Oz.

1004
01:26:56,689 --> 01:26:58,645
What...

1005
01:27:06,129 --> 01:27:09,838
Sorry, Frankie. I always liked you.

1006
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:14,518
Wh... Why... Why did you kill him?!

1007
01:27:14,649 --> 01:27:16,605
Well, I had to kill one of you.

1008
01:27:18,769 --> 01:27:22,000
Well, then, you definitely
made the right decision.

1009
01:27:25,249 --> 01:27:27,604
Why did you have to kill him?!

1010
01:27:31,929 --> 01:27:34,841
Well, if I didn't kill you, Frankie would have.

1011
01:27:35,889 --> 01:27:39,928
And... he would have thought
that I'd gone soft,

1012
01:27:41,049 --> 01:27:44,086
eventually come after me and the money.

1013
01:27:47,769 --> 01:27:51,523
So... what about me?

1014
01:27:53,049 --> 01:27:56,086
I want the bulk of the money
to be put into this account.

1015
01:27:56,209 --> 01:27:59,087
I also want one million dollars
placed in this account

1016
01:27:59,209 --> 01:28:02,645
under the name of Dr Nicholas
and Mrs Cynthia Oseransky.

1017
01:28:02,889 --> 01:28:05,039
- One million dollars...
- What?

1018
01:28:05,569 --> 01:28:08,003
An early wedding present from Jimmy.

1019
01:28:09,929 --> 01:28:12,079
Not that Jimmy.

1020
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:15,923
- Can we have another minute?
- Certainly.

1021
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,205
- Thanks.
- I'll just...

1022
01:28:22,409 --> 01:28:25,048
- Is this for real?
- Yes, but to get the money,

1023
01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:30,004
you have to show up together and show them
a copy of a validated marriage certificate.

1024
01:28:30,129 --> 01:28:33,360
- Jimmy's giving me a divorce?
- Don't you read the papers, lady?

1025
01:28:33,489 --> 01:28:35,366
Jimmy Tudeski's dead.

1026
01:28:42,009 --> 01:28:45,365
- I don't know what to say.
- When the time comes... just say "I do".

1027
01:28:47,449 --> 01:28:48,518
Yo!

1028
01:28:48,769 --> 01:28:52,603
Maybe I am going soft. In the old days,
I would have definitely killed you.

1029
01:28:52,849 --> 01:28:54,805
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1030
01:28:57,049 --> 01:28:59,438
Or... I dunno.

1031
01:29:00,769 --> 01:29:03,124
Maybe I have changed since my death.

1032
01:29:04,849 --> 01:29:08,364
- I don't think that's what it is.
- What do you mean?

1033
01:29:10,409 --> 01:29:13,162
- You love her, don't you?
- Cynthia?

1034
01:29:29,009 --> 01:29:32,968
Hi, Oz. Cynthia's waiting for you.
She said you'd know where.

1035
01:29:37,049 --> 01:29:39,609
Say hi to my widow for me, will you?

1036
01:29:41,569 --> 01:29:43,525
Take care of yourself.

1037
01:30:02,889 --> 01:30:04,845
Marry me.

1038
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:12,642
Jimmy told you.

1039
01:30:12,769 --> 01:30:14,725
What?

1040
01:30:16,849 --> 01:30:18,805
He didn't, did he?

1041
01:30:21,889 --> 01:30:25,086
You just... wanna marry me?

1042
01:30:25,209 --> 01:30:27,165
No.

1043
01:30:28,209 --> 01:30:32,646
No, I don'tjust wanna marry you.
I wanna marry you more than anyone's

1044
01:30:32,769 --> 01:30:36,921
wanted to marry anyone
in the history of the world.

1045
01:30:40,609 --> 01:30:43,169
Then would I be out of line if I told you...

1046
01:30:44,769 --> 01:30:46,725
that I loved you?

1047
01:30:57,649 --> 01:30:59,605
And said "Yes"?

1048
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:05,325
- I would love to marry you.
- So you...

1049
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:09,567
wouldn't mind spending
the rest of your life with a poor dentist?

1050
01:31:09,689 --> 01:31:12,044
Somethin' tells me we'll get by.

1051
01:31:18,689 --> 01:31:21,249
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus

1052
01:31:21,369 --> 01:31:24,088
When he said the world was round

1053
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:29,006
They all laughed
when Edison recorded sound

1054
01:31:30,489 --> 01:31:32,923
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother

1055
01:31:33,049 --> 01:31:36,007
When they said that man could fly

1056
01:31:36,129 --> 01:31:38,802
They told Marconi wireless was a phoney

1057
01:31:39,209 --> 01:31:40,881
It's the same old cry

1058
01:31:41,009 --> 01:31:44,240
They laughed at me wanting you

1059
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:46,997
Said I was reaching for the moon

1060
01:31:47,449 --> 01:31:50,407
But, ooh, you came through

1061
01:31:50,529 --> 01:31:53,362
Now they'll have to change their tune

1062
01:31:54,169 --> 01:31:56,444
They all said we never could be happy

1063
01:31:56,689 --> 01:31:59,123
They laughed at us and how

1064
01:31:59,409 --> 01:32:00,922
But ho, ho, ho

1065
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:04,644
Who's got the last laugh now?

1066
01:32:05,809 --> 01:32:08,198
They all laughed at Rockefeller Center

1067
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:11,207
Now they're fighting to get in

1068
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:15,921
They all laughed
at Whitney and his cotton gin

1069
01:32:17,529 --> 01:32:20,043
They all laughed
at Fulton and his steamboat

1070
01:32:20,169 --> 01:32:22,888
Hershey and his chocolate bar

1071
01:32:23,009 --> 01:32:24,488
Ford and his Lizzy

1072
01:32:24,609 --> 01:32:26,327
Kept the laughers busy

1073
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:27,598
That's how people are

1074
01:32:27,729 --> 01:32:31,199
They laughed at me wanting you

1075
01:32:31,329 --> 01:32:34,287
Said it'll be hello, goodbye

1076
01:32:34,609 --> 01:32:37,077
And, ooh, you came through

1077
01:32:37,209 --> 01:32:40,519
Now they're eating humble pie

1078
01:32:40,849 --> 01:32:43,283
They all said we'd never get together

1079
01:32:43,409 --> 01:32:45,923
Darling, let's take a bow

1080
01:32:46,049 --> 01:32:47,562
For ho, ho, ho

1081
01:32:47,689 --> 01:32:52,001
Who's got the last laugh now?

1082
01:33:59,529 --> 01:34:02,839
They laughed at me wanting you

1083
01:34:02,969 --> 01:34:06,245
Said it would be hello, goodbye

1084
01:34:06,369 --> 01:34:08,837
But, ooh, you came through

1085
01:34:08,969 --> 01:34:12,086
Now they're eating humble pie

1086
01:34:12,529 --> 01:34:15,248
They all said we'd never get together

1087
01:34:15,369 --> 01:34:17,485
Darling, let's take a bow

1088
01:34:17,609 --> 01:34:19,361
For ho, ho, ho

1089
01:34:19,489 --> 01:34:20,808
Who's got the last laugh?

1090
01:34:20,929 --> 01:34:22,157
Hee, hee, hee

1091
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:23,847
Let's have the past laugh

1092
01:34:23,969 --> 01:34:31,364
Ha, ha, ha, who's got the last laugh now?

1093
01:34:36,209 --> 01:34:39,167
