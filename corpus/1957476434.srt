2
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,392
Go back to Mama!

3
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,282
Good morning, Jesmark.

4
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,784
Morning, ma’am.

5
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,244
Catch any fish today?

6
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,620
No, nothing.

7
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:48,580
You always catch something.

8
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,666
- Just one.
- One.

9
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,253
C’mon, not the big one.

10
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:01,468
Do I get the special price?

11
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,262
Fine, the special price.

12
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:04,513
Bye, Jesmark.

13
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:05,722
Carry on.

14
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:12,020
A fish for every girl?

15
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,439
So many girls, so few fish.

16
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,073
- What’s wrong?
- Dunno.

17
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,871
Looks okay here.

18
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:41,174
Easy, you’re gonna bust it.

19
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:42,634
Yeah, but...

20
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,344
Here’s your problem.

21
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:45,888
I’ll redo the caulking.

22
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:47,639
Caulking won’t fix it.

23
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:50,392
The boat itself
has a structural problem.

24
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:55,022
Your dad used to break his back
on this luzzu.

25
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:56,815
Yeah, I remember.

26
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,652
C’mon, let’s pull it up.

27
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:40,359
- Watch your driving!
- You chose this road.

28
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,778
Oh, it’s my fault?

29
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:45,364
If it’s full of potholes,
what can I do?

30
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,282
You love driving through them.

31
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:49,660
You haven’t missed
a single one yet.

32
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,453
Should I drive backwards?

33
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,918
That’s enough!

34
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:04,675
- Here’s fine, right?
- Of course.

35
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:05,551
One, two...

36
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:15,352
Slowly.

37
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:16,812
One more.

38
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:20,065
Let’s do it right.

39
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:22,067
- You got it in there?
- Yeah.

40
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:26,196
Let it dry,
then we’ll get started.

41
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:28,240
We’ll make it good as new.

42
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:30,659
You’ll be out in force-10 winds.

43
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,286
Not even God will stop it!

44
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:35,205
C’mon, let’s go.

45
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:36,999
Easy!

46
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,009
<i>Coming.</i>

47
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,220
<i>I said I’m coming!</i>

48
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:59,021
- I know I’m late. Sorry Mary Grace.
- I called you.

49
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:00,772
- Didn’t hear your phone?
- My battery died.

50
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:04,902
Yeah, right, it was ringing.
You didn’t pick up.

51
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:05,819
Here.

52
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,863
You’re the best, Mary Grace!

53
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,489
Yeah, Prince Charming.

54
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,909
Hey, Denise said you’d pay me.

55
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,869
The money’s upstairs.
I’ll bring it later.

56
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,622
- Don’t keep me waiting.
- I won’t, I’ll bring it.

57
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:17,748
Jesmark!

58
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:18,916
I’m late!

59
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:42,648
Yes!

60
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:44,107
Alright I’m here.

61
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,484
Where are you?

62
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:46,860
Behind you.

63
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:47,903
Hey!

64
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,029
What happened?

65
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:51,907
- The luzzu’s got a leak.
- Again?

66
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:52,783
Hey, handsome.

67
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:55,410
C’mon, let’s make a move.

68
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,204
You smell like a whale’s pussy.

69
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:57,996
Yeah, I know.

70
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:03,627
See the bunny?
Did you see the bunny?

71
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,545
And the blocks?

72
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:11,510
- We’ve got something for you.
- What?

73
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,095
Yuck, Jes’!

74
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:15,264
It’s not my fault.

75
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,015
He gets that from you, not me.

76
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,433
You sure?

77
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,643
Yes, I’m sure.

78
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:20,978
<i>Aiden Saliba, please.</i>

79
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:21,895
C’mon, that’s us.

80
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:27,025
See what she’s doing?
The doctor better see me instead.

81
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,736
- I have witnesses.
- Oh, poor you.

82
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:36,994
There, good boy.

83
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,464
Are you eating well, Denise?

84
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:51,466
- What, can’t you tell?
- Hey!

85
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:54,344
- Isn’t it true?
- Yes, I’m eating fine.

86
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:57,723
I’m sorry to ask,
but are you smoking or drinking?

87
00:08:58,265 --> 00:08:58,932
No.

88
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,893
And you’re back at work, now?

89
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:03,896
And you, Jesmark.
How long do you stay at sea?

90
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,689
A day or two.

91
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:07,733
- Who takes care of Aiden?
- Our neighbour.

92
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,484
So...

93
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:13,906
It’s hard to say what’s causing it.

94
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:17,784
Maybe it’s something genetic.
In the family, that is.

95
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,870
Or his environment.

96
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:22,497
His environment?

97
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,999
We don’t know exactly but

98
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:28,295
Aiden isn’t growing properly and
we need to do something immediately.

99
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:33,467
Now, here’s what we’ll do.

100
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:37,221
We’ll start a diet
with a fattening formula.

101
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:41,183
You’ll need to take him
to a dietician once a week.

102
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:44,353
I’d also like you to see
a speech therapist.

103
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,271
A speech therapist?

104
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:49,149
To see if it’s a problem
with his swallowing.

105
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,027
And we can do this here?

106
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,238
No, he needs specialists.

107
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,492
Otherwise, you risk him
not developing properly.

108
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:06,458
I’m up all night feeding him.
He is eating.

109
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,127
I know, Denise.
These things happen.

110
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:10,087
What things?

111
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:13,131
For example, sometimes mothers
don’t produce enough milk.

112
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,759
Sometimes the baby doesn’t
accept it.

113
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,345
- Doesn’t accept it?
- So it’s my fault?

114
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:21,139
- No, that’s not what I’m saying.
- Yes, you are.

115
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:25,769
Alright, it’s not my fault then.

116
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:28,146
If it’s not our fault, whose is it?

117
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:29,147
Hey, come back.

118
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:34,653
I’m sorry.

119
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:36,780
Don’t worry,
I’ve seen cases like this.

120
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:38,657
But right now it’s critical...

121
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,327
Feed him well and get him
the care he needs.

122
00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:33,503
This one?

123
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:36,840
That’s the normal kind.
We need this.

124
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:40,302
That’s more fattening.

125
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,638
Fifty and two cents, please.

126
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:52,731
Here, Jes’.

127
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:29,643
C’mon, don’t worry.

128
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:59,756
That’s it, little jellyfish.

129
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:01,508
He seems to like it.

130
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,927
For 40 euros, I’d hope so.

131
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:12,019
There’s quite a few
seabream this year.

132
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,646
If this keeps up,
should be a good season.

133
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,024
Do you know how much
it’s going to cost us?

134
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:19,026
The immunizations alone
are 300 euros.

135
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,903
You think I don’t know?

136
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:30,203
I saw someone post this.

137
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,084
Trawlers destroy the seabed.
Sorry, I can’t do that.

138
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:38,629
So what are we going to do, Jes’?

139
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:43,425
We’ll find a specialist we can afford.

140
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:50,015
I already called my mum.

141
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:51,892
Why drag her into this?

142
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,852
Half her friends are doctors.

143
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:55,771
She brags about it enough.

144
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,147
C’mon, Jes’.

145
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:01,777
Weren’t you the one who didn’t
want her around?

146
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:04,404
She broke her promise
for your tattoo shop.

147
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,073
She wants you under her thumb.

148
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,199
I know.

149
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:21,046
Why are you giving in now?

150
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,053
I’ll take care of us, okay?

151
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:01,753
It’s time.
Throw it, throw it!

152
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:06,884
You’re gonna tear my finger off!

153
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:09,303
We’ll catch a big fish with it.

154
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:12,139
We’d be done already
if you set the lines properly.

155
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,349
When you fix your luzzu,

156
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:16,935
set up the lines
however you want.

157
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,031
Anything?

158
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:32,075
Not a bite. Dunno why.

159
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:40,334
Here we go!
Take the line to the prow.

160
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,795
We’ve got something for sure!

161
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:46,256
Don’t send me up here for
nothing.

162
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:58,644
Get the hook!
Hurry, hurry!

163
00:15:58,685 --> 00:15:59,228
C’mon!

164
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:05,817
Grab him by the head.

165
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:20,332
Fucking swordfish.

166
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,062
Chuck it, let’s make a move!

167
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:53,407
What are you doing?

168
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:54,658
We’re keeping it.

169
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,077
C’mon, in closed season?

170
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,369
And so what?

171
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,330
It’s worth 500 euros for sure.

172
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,585
Hey, close that hatch!

173
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:07,087
- Why?
- My boat, my risk.

174
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,798
Forget closed season,
you know it’s bullshit.

175
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,965
It’s illegal.

176
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:12,509
They’ll screw me.

177
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:14,802
Since when has it been illegal?

178
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,053
Since when?

179
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:19,641
We’ve been fishing like this
for a thousand years.

180
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:22,853
It’s dead! What will you get
by throwing it back?

181
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:24,897
Don’t get me into trouble.

182
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:28,734
You know what’s happening
with Aiden. I need this.

183
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:36,074
- Give me a chance, okay?
- Don’t be a pain in the ass!

184
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:39,202
What are you doing?

185
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:44,750
Think everyone else is a saint?

186
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,086
Fisheries?
This is the<i> Kolarosa.</i>

187
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:54,009
Listen, we were bottom fishing
and caught a swordfish on the line.

188
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:56,011
That’s right, a swordfish.

189
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,641
Yes, okay, but...

190
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,186
Can’t we sort something out?

191
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:08,482
These things die the minute
you take them out of the water.

192
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:12,236
Can’t we keep it
for ourselves at least?

193
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:14,696
For our families?

194
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:44,685
- Move.
- You fucked it.

195
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,678
Good morning.

196
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,888
Morning.

197
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:22,723
What do we have?

198
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:24,641
Three boxes.

199
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:27,978
- This is everything?
- That’s it.

200
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,564
- Let’s see your logbook.
- Grab it, Jesmark.

201
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:37,362
Let’s see.

202
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:42,492
A box of snappers, skate,
and dogfish.

203
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,663
- I need to do an inspection.
- Are you serious?

204
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,665
All boats require routine
checks.

205
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:50,000
So do my balls.

206
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:52,002
Drop it, let’s get on with it.

207
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:56,673
If your boat is clean,
this will be quick.

208
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:07,476
What’s he looking for?
His mother?

209
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:28,038
Watch your mouth.
Next time, I’ll cite you.

210
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,998
Cite whatever the fuck you want.

211
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,750
Have a good day.

212
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,718
Can you shut your mouth for
once?

213
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,720
Shut my mouth?

214
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:47,224
C’mon, man. Next time,
he’ll really screw us.

215
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:50,102
Next time, I’ll knock him
into the sea.

216
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,247
Careful, box behind you.

217
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:39,109
They never sell our stuff
till the end, see?

218
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:43,238
Who’s this new hawker?

219
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,532
The new owners brought him in.

220
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,913
Five for lampuki.

221
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:54,625
- You’re free to go elsewhere!
- Give us a good price!

222
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,919
Give us a deal!

223
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,005
Squid: five sixty.
Write that down.

224
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:04,009
There’s our fish. Let’s go.

225
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:08,764
Last fish of the day! Last fish!
Dogfish and skate!

226
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:10,849
Skate, one fifty!

227
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:13,018
Skate, one fifty!

228
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,937
What the hell is he doing?

229
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:17,356
Dogfish, four euros!

230
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:19,650
Sell our snappers!

231
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:21,985
Dogfish, four euros!

232
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:24,029
Dogfish, four euros!

233
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,365
Stop wasting time
with the fucking dogfish!

234
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:27,991
Dogfish, four euros!

235
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:33,830
You need to sell our good stuff!

236
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:36,333
Wanna sell? Do it yourself!

237
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,211
- Come on, man!
- What the hell!

238
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:42,839
Come back! You can’t do that!

239
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:44,216
You taking it or not?

240
00:22:44,258 --> 00:22:46,468
We don’t have anywhere
to keep them.

241
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,888
- We don’t have a freezer van!
- Better sell quick! C’mon!

242
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,098
Take it.

243
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:54,017
Fucking bastard.

244
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,242
- Morning.
- What’s up?

245
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:13,453
- Interested in anything today?
- Depends on what you have.

246
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,666
My fridge is full.

247
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,251
Take some of mine, too.

248
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:21,920
For tomorrow.
See how fresh it looks?

249
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,342
I’ve still got leftovers.

250
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:29,094
- This is fresh.
- I’ve got leftovers.

251
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,890
- You don’t want this one?
- Too small.

252
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:35,225
- Small?
- Yeah, small. C’mon.

253
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,643
- How much for it?
- Fourteen.

254
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:40,188
C’mon, they used to be 15.
Don’t I deserve 15?

255
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,940
A fisherman came before you.

256
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:43,775
How much did you get?

257
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:45,402
Come back tomorrow.

258
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,113
Thank you.

259
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:49,823
I said don’t come here.

260
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:52,618
- That wasn’t my fault!
- Take your stuff and leave.

261
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,870
Don’t show your face
around here anymore.

262
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,205
We can’t keep going on like
this.

263
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:58,916
That’s all I’ve got.

264
00:23:58,957 --> 00:23:59,750
Alright?

265
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,892
- I told you not to...
- I know.

266
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:18,685
- Please don’t.
- Why?

267
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,437
Can’t you let me try?

268
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:27,027
You know my brother
and nephews fish for me.

269
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,529
Yeah, they catch good stuff.
But this is better.

270
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:31,406
What did I just tell you?

271
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,867
I’ll have to throw it out.

272
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:35,994
The garbage is outside.

273
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:44,628
If he comes again,

274
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,256
it’ll be bad for him
and worse for you.

275
00:24:58,141 --> 00:24:59,893
He didn’t take them?

276
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:03,772
Onto the next, let’s go.

277
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:07,276
They’re starting to stink.
Let’s just throw them out.

278
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:18,912
Make the sign of the cross,
friend.

279
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:20,914
God, bless this fisherman’s boat.

280
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:22,874
Deliver them from danger,

281
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,669
fill their nets,
and bring them home safely.

282
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:22,476
Gianni? What happened to him?

283
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:25,229
Poor Gianni ended up
in that shit show.

284
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,024
- Is that still going on?
- The laws are too strict.

285
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:32,736
It’s like this slipway.
They fixed the wooden slats,

286
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:35,155
but you can’t use it
or you’ll get fined.

287
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:37,950
Back in the day,
luzzus could come and go.

288
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:42,704
- Nowadays, they’re not practical.
- Exactly.

289
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:46,625
They’re fixing them with European funds
and we don’t even get to use them.

290
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,753
Laws, laws, don’t you remember
my uncle?

291
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:51,880
Yeah, poor Sammy.

292
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:54,633
He went to work in a factory
and he was losing his mind.

293
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:56,760
Then he borrowed money
to buy a tuna quota,

294
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:59,763
but no tuna came that season.
So what did he do?

295
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:02,391
They caught him
with contraband cigarettes.

296
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:06,353
Two years jail, three years probation,
and 100,000 euro fine.

297
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:09,898
- Tell me who will pay for that?
- His children.

298
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,943
- It’s like we’re criminals.
- That how it is, now.

299
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:16,363
And you?
What happened to the luzzu?

300
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:18,073
Pulled it up on the beach.

301
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:20,075
But the wood will shrink like that.

302
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:23,036
I know, but it was going to sink.

303
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:26,039
- It’s better in the sea than on land.
- I’m gonna fix it.

304
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,292
I’m gonna fix it.

305
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,210
Yeah, but wood isn’t fiberglass.

306
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:32,254
Wood is a living thing.

307
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:45,851
Now I’ll see where it needs
caulking.

308
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:48,770
I’ll sand the whole thing
down to the waterline.

309
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:50,689
Should take about a week.

310
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:54,234
Don’t scratch it,
you’ll only add more work.

311
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:57,029
Change this whole piece.

312
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,198
That’s the one that’s been
giving me trouble.

313
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,701
Just have to find someone
to do the job.

314
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:06,788
A final lick of paint...

315
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:11,877
Antifouling and we’re ready to go.

316
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,212
- And if it leaks again?
- It won’t.

317
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:18,091
I’ll use a good sealant. The new piece
will be custom-built.

318
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:19,635
It won’t leak.

319
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:21,053
I promise.

320
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,651
Let’s get Aiden before
Mary Grace starts calling.

321
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:37,444
He’s not with Mary Grace.

322
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:38,946
Where is he?

323
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:40,614
Mum picked him up this morning.

324
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:41,698
Why?

325
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,991
She offered.

326
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:46,954
We need help.

327
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:48,205
We’re fine.

328
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:23,991
Where are you going?

329
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,662
To my mum’s.

330
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,873
She booked doctor appointments
for tomorrow.

331
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:34,209
You didn’t tell me.
Should we meet there?

332
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:36,295
No, don’t worry.

333
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:38,297
I’ll take care of everything.

334
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:40,340
He’s my son, too.

335
00:29:44,803 --> 00:29:47,890
Do you think it was easy
for me to call her?

336
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,980
C’mon, I’ll drive you.

337
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:57,357
I can manage.

338
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,568
It’ll take you forever on the bus.

339
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:24,069
I’m telling you,
it was the biggest catch of his life.

340
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:27,322
Didn’t you ever hear this?

341
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,325
Picture this...

342
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:33,203
The luzzu is full of lampuki...

343
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:34,913
Engine’s totally fucked...

344
00:31:34,955 --> 00:31:36,248
And with incredible strength,

345
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,001
your dad rowed
all the way back to shore.

346
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:41,461
Jesus, these rips are huge.

347
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:44,965
Don’t make a fuss.
Just clean them.

348
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,800
What will you catch with these?

349
00:31:46,842 --> 00:31:48,176
Whales?

350
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,515
Watch out, Cikas.

351
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:54,850
Move, Cikas.

352
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:19,625
Mind if I crash here tonight?

353
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:22,628
You can sleep with Cikas
on his cushion.

354
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:32,346
Tomorrow?

355
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:36,767
<i>We have appointments all day again.</i>

356
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:38,644
So what’s the plan?

357
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,814
<i>Give me the rest of the week here.</i>

358
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:49,613
Can I bring you guys anything?

359
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,240
<i>We’re okay.</i>

360
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,326
Is he with you?

361
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:55,661
<i>He’s right here.</i>

362
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:57,204
Let me listen.

363
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:37,995
Jesmark...

364
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:40,414
Is Denise here?
I tried calling her.

365
00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:42,374
She went to see her uncle.

366
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,464
Here.

367
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:58,849
- This will give him gas.
- How do you know?

368
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:00,726
Doctor’s orders, not mine.

369
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:03,394
You can’t feed him this cheap stuff.

370
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:06,439
Is Aiden here?

371
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:08,150
He’s asleep.

372
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:10,235
Can I see him?

373
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:12,571
I just put him down.
He didn’t sleep much.

374
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,488
I’d like to see him.

375
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,909
Please.

376
00:34:24,124 --> 00:34:25,292
Hey, handsome.

377
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:26,793
Alright, monkey?

378
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:30,130
Here, take this one.

379
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:46,939
It’s always nice to see you.

380
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:48,565
Did I say I was leaving?

381
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:27,354
Make an offer!

382
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:32,526
Is this fucking guy serious?

383
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:37,322
Sell it at four euros!

384
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:39,741
Didn’t you sell the others at four?

385
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,758
Auction is over.

386
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,220
I saw the swordfish.

387
00:37:23,262 --> 00:37:25,556
I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

388
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:18,483
What the fuck are you doing here?

389
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:21,862
- You got trouble?
- It’s not your business, man.

390
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:24,656
Let me talk to your boss.

391
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:27,200
Why, you got scallops?

392
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:28,160
Scallops?

393
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:31,079
Boss needs scallops.
You got them?

394
00:38:31,121 --> 00:38:31,914
No?

395
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:34,875
Then get the fuck out of here!
We don’t need you.

396
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:35,959
Move, man!

397
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,419
Don’t waste our time.

398
00:38:38,378 --> 00:38:40,380
C’mon, move!

399
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,179
Keep moving, man! Fuck off!

400
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:45,195
My trucks are loaded.

401
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:47,322
We have an understanding.

402
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:49,199
They’re on their way.

403
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:55,747
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You can make money off these.

404
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:58,292
Cook ’em,
no one will know the difference.

405
00:40:02,713 --> 00:40:05,340
- How much?
- Fifty.

406
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:07,217
You’re kidding me, right?

407
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:11,013
You come in here
and try to sell my junk back to me?

408
00:40:11,054 --> 00:40:13,140
It’s not junk if you know
what you’re doing.

409
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:16,143
Don’t tell me you’ve been
selling these off for cat food.

410
00:40:16,184 --> 00:40:18,020
I get good prices.

411
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:20,522
Let me work with you.
You’ll see what I can do.

412
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,359
- Can you clean a fish?
- In my sleep.

413
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,782
- What do you pay?
- One fifty.

414
00:40:30,824 --> 00:40:33,827
Two hundred and your trucks
make it on time.

415
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:38,100
Later.

416
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:57,452
Turn it more so it doesn’t
get swept away.

417
00:41:57,494 --> 00:41:59,371
It’s safe here.

418
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,918
I don’t think you remember
because you’re young.

419
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,005
Your grandfather set out with
this boat,

420
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:10,632
going with the eastern wind,
the "foreign chill."

421
00:42:10,674 --> 00:42:16,305
Clouds were gathering in the west
and your grandfather saw it coming.

422
00:42:16,346 --> 00:42:19,391
The wind was merciless.
He wasn’t going to make it.

423
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:23,353
Then a big ship came towards him.

424
00:42:23,395 --> 00:42:26,732
He kept close to that ship
all night for shelter.

425
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:32,321
And by morning,
he said he’d arrived in Tunis.

426
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:37,075
Sicily maybe!

427
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:39,578
You need two days for Tunis!

428
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,830
That’s your grandfather’s story.

429
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:44,041
Yeah, a story for the gullible!

430
00:42:56,136 --> 00:42:57,471
What can I do for you?

431
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:03,685
- Got time?
- Which side?

432
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:06,688
Right.

433
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,108
- That’s 40 inches.
- That’s right.

434
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,610
Very good.

435
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:33,340
How’s that?

436
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,011
Can you leave it for now?
I’ll come back later.

437
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:39,221
- What’s wrong?
- Nothing.

438
00:43:39,263 --> 00:43:41,807
- Don’t make me work for nothing.
- Of course not.

439
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:44,309
- You’re coming back for it, right?
- Of course.

440
00:44:48,498 --> 00:44:49,666
What’s wrong?

441
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:51,001
- Do you need petrol?
- What?

442
00:44:51,043 --> 00:44:52,878
- Do you want petrol?
- Petrol?

443
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,087
For your car.

444
00:44:54,129 --> 00:44:56,214
- Is it mixed with something?
- Of course not.

445
00:44:56,256 --> 00:44:59,176
- Will it damage the engine?
- No, it won’t. C’mon.

446
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:00,594
Want some?

447
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:02,471
How much?

448
00:45:02,512 --> 00:45:05,891
- 30 euros a can?
- For that much, I’ll go to the station.

449
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:09,353
It’ll be more at the station.
Okay, how much?

450
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:10,687
Twenty-five?

451
00:45:19,404 --> 00:45:20,447
Alright?

452
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:24,868
- Anything extra for me?
- You don’t deserve shit.

453
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:28,080
- It’s clean, right?
- I was using it myself.

454
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:30,999
- I have more over there.
- Gentleman’s word?

455
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,834
Nothing to worry about.

456
00:45:40,842 --> 00:45:42,094
Jes’!

457
00:45:42,135 --> 00:45:43,637
Hey, Kev’!

458
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,349
Alright, man?

459
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,268
What’s with the shirt?

460
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:51,770
Carla’s idea.
You know how she is.

461
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:54,022
Throw it in the dumpster.

462
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:55,232
What’s all this?

463
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:57,859
- Need some?
- No, tank’s full.

464
00:45:57,901 --> 00:46:00,737
Fucking 60 euros to fill a tank now.

465
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:02,197
Bye-bye subsidy.

466
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,449
What happened?

467
00:46:04,491 --> 00:46:06,618
Didn’t you hear?

468
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,619
Hear what?

469
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:09,746
I’m not fishing anymore.

470
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:14,001
I took the EU buyout deal.
Turned in my boat and licence.

471
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:15,377
I didn’t know.

472
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:17,004
It’s been a few months.

473
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:20,340
I should get back to work.

474
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:27,973
Hey, I’ll take one.

475
00:46:28,015 --> 00:46:29,516
Isn’t your tank full?

476
00:46:29,558 --> 00:46:31,059
I’ll need it later.

477
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:33,020
Don’t worry, I’ll sell it.

478
00:46:36,773 --> 00:46:38,734
I should try to beat the traffic.

479
00:46:38,775 --> 00:46:40,360
Good to see you.

480
00:47:14,937 --> 00:47:18,190
So what do they need to do now?

481
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:19,733
Well...

482
00:47:19,775 --> 00:47:22,069
It’s up to us now.

483
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,488
We have to be sure
he keeps gaining.

484
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:44,216
I got a new job.
I’m quitting at Lino’s.

485
00:47:44,258 --> 00:47:46,134
A new job?

486
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:48,011
You didn’t tell me.

487
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:51,139
My uncle sorted it out this week...

488
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:52,891
at the Planning Agency.

489
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,518
So your uncle’s good now?

490
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,144
You said he’s a crook.

491
00:47:56,186 --> 00:47:58,230
He’s only trying to help.

492
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:01,233
You’ll rubber stamp
some permits for him?

493
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:03,402
I’ll be doing graphic design.

494
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:05,612
One of us needs a good job.

495
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:13,203
I know you love what you do.

496
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:16,290
We don’t look at work the same way.

497
00:48:25,507 --> 00:48:29,094
I don’t want him to have less
than what I had.

498
00:48:29,136 --> 00:48:33,181
- I don’t want him...
- To be like me?

499
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:35,601
You know that’s not what I think.

500
00:48:35,642 --> 00:48:37,311
And your family?

501
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,751
C’mon, Jes’.

502
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:03,128
Am I gonna do the whole thing myself?

503
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:15,724
Without a boat...

504
00:49:18,143 --> 00:49:21,230
You lose your way.

505
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:23,649
I’ve seen it happen to other guys.

506
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:30,656
If your dad was here...

507
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:32,991
Can you stop?

508
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:34,743
What?

509
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:37,871
Think I don’t know what he’d say?

510
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:43,210
I know what I have to do.

511
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:52,177
I’m off.

512
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:54,304
Check out the nerve of this guy.

513
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:23,917
The waypoints are marked.

514
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:26,044
Uday will show you the rest.

515
00:50:47,149 --> 00:50:49,276
Welcome aboard, fisherman.

516
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:15,761
Have coffee.

517
00:51:27,147 --> 00:51:28,857
This your boat?

518
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,192
My boat?

519
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:31,985
This is my<i> Titanic.</i>

520
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:33,403
My home, brother.

521
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:40,911
Sea workers like me travel the world,
just for the work.

522
00:51:40,953 --> 00:51:43,205
They don’t give permissions
to live on the land.

523
00:51:43,247 --> 00:51:45,290
So we live on the boats.

524
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:51,880
- I’ve never left this island.
- Never?

525
00:51:53,298 --> 00:51:55,592
A fish stays in the bowl...

526
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:57,010
Never grows.

527
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:16,738
Can you see it?

528
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:23,996
That’s it, that’s the one!

529
00:52:24,037 --> 00:52:25,414
To the right.

530
00:52:45,017 --> 00:52:45,976
See?

531
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:48,437
This is the marker.

532
00:52:48,478 --> 00:52:52,065
When a fisherman catches a fish,
which he isn’t supposed to catch,

533
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:56,987
he throws it back into the sea and
marks the spot so that we can find it.

534
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:59,990
You have to be fast though,
while it’s fresh.

535
00:53:00,032 --> 00:53:02,910
We give it to the boss,
he sells it.

536
00:53:02,951 --> 00:53:04,870
Fisherman gets a cut, too.

537
00:53:06,496 --> 00:53:08,248
Which fishermen?

538
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,791
Could be anyone.

539
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,001
Your friends, even.

540
00:53:15,797 --> 00:53:19,468
You know how many fucking fish
I’ve thrown in the sea?

541
00:53:21,762 --> 00:53:23,138
Give me the rope.

542
00:54:46,638 --> 00:54:48,891
C’mon, man. Keep it moving.

543
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:20,464
Got anything else?

544
00:55:23,258 --> 00:55:24,259
Like what?

545
00:55:26,261 --> 00:55:27,679
Anything.

546
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:46,031
How much do we have in the back?

547
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:49,451
With us?

548
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:51,995
It’s nothing, brother.

549
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:53,622
Maybe a couple thousand.

550
00:55:53,664 --> 00:55:55,624
We’ve done bigger deals.

551
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,084
Restaurants, fish shops.

552
00:55:57,125 --> 00:56:00,587
They pay huge amounts
when it’s closed season.

553
00:56:00,629 --> 00:56:02,756
They buy fresh from us...

554
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:04,758
Or frozen from the supermarkets.

555
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,386
I saw your boss pay the
inspector.

556
00:56:07,427 --> 00:56:09,221
He’s a big fish, too?

557
00:56:09,263 --> 00:56:10,389
You got it, brother.

558
00:56:19,648 --> 00:56:21,858
This is my favourite song, man.

559
00:56:23,777 --> 00:56:27,573
We got money in the back, c’mon!

560
00:56:27,614 --> 00:56:30,617
C’mon! What the fuck, man?
Dance with me!

561
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:35,789
I love it.
This is my shit.

562
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:50,137
Did he sleep much?

563
00:56:50,178 --> 00:56:53,098
I just put him down.

564
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,475
I saw David’s boat on the dock.

565
00:56:55,517 --> 00:56:57,477
You didn’t go with him?

566
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:58,645
No, I didn’t.

567
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:03,734
So you went with Tonio?

568
00:57:03,775 --> 00:57:05,777
I took a shift on the trawler.

569
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:14,328
Can you get more work with them?

570
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,413
Yeah.

571
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:21,627
He’ll need to eat soon.

572
00:57:21,668 --> 00:57:24,880
- We have formula?
- Everything’s in the kitchen.

573
00:57:24,922 --> 00:57:27,215
Alright.

574
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:31,428
- Gotta run. You’ll be okay?
- I’ll take care of everything.

575
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:32,763
I’m off.

576
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,813
Hey, man, wait a second.
I got it for you.

577
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:20,120
Be careful, huh?

578
00:59:22,915 --> 00:59:24,791
You called me for a box of fish?

579
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,668
Say thank you, brother.

580
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,587
This is an opportunity.

581
00:59:28,629 --> 00:59:32,591
The boss needs favors from politicians.
But they don’t like brown guys.

582
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:34,885
Especially their cash in my hands.

583
00:59:34,927 --> 00:59:35,844
You know?

584
00:59:45,062 --> 00:59:46,688
Better get moving.

585
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,106
And don’t fuck up.

586
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:38,699
You’re the new guy?

587
01:00:42,035 --> 01:00:43,203
See you.

588
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:24,328
I need guys to move my stuff.

589
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:26,371
Salmon in...

590
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:27,873
Tuna out.

591
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:34,338
You got a freezer van?

592
01:01:34,379 --> 01:01:35,505
Freezer van?

593
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:37,341
Like this.

594
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:40,093
Think I got that kind of money?

595
01:01:40,135 --> 01:01:41,803
Don’t you need more fishermen?

596
01:01:43,513 --> 01:01:45,015
Jesus Christ.

597
01:01:45,057 --> 01:01:48,977
How many fish do you think
will be left in 20 years?

598
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:51,480
The way the temperature is rising?

599
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:56,693
Don’t read much, do you?

600
01:01:58,654 --> 01:02:00,322
Better start.

601
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:55,752
Your family?

602
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:58,880
Yes, mother and sister.

603
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:00,090
Miss them?

604
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:01,800
My sister is coming soon.

605
01:03:01,842 --> 01:03:03,635
Boss is helping with it.

606
01:03:03,677 --> 01:03:05,762
We got her a place to live.

607
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:08,223
We got her into a nursing school.

608
01:03:08,265 --> 01:03:11,226
This guy’s got friends
everywhere.

609
01:03:11,268 --> 01:03:14,605
If you keep working with us,
he’ll help you, too.

610
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:20,110
I love this food.
The taste is nice.

611
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:28,452
Yeah, really nice.

612
01:03:28,493 --> 01:03:29,995
It’s the spice.

613
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:35,876
What do you mean?

614
01:03:35,918 --> 01:03:38,211
Those fishermen,
they make trouble to us.

615
01:03:38,253 --> 01:03:39,588
We pay them back.

616
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,340
That’s part of our job.

617
01:03:41,381 --> 01:03:43,508
People who fuck with us,
we fuck with them.

618
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:44,718
That’s it.

619
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:08,408
Hey man, let’s go!
Hurry up!

620
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:10,994
Hurry up, man!

621
01:04:34,518 --> 01:04:36,770
Let’s go, man. Hurry up!

622
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:11,430
Come have a look.

623
01:05:18,687 --> 01:05:20,981
Finished the caulking.

624
01:05:21,023 --> 01:05:23,191
Called in a favor
for the missing piece.

625
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:26,069
All that’s left now
is painting the rest,

626
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:27,070
antifouling,

627
01:05:27,112 --> 01:05:29,781
and in a couple of days
it’s ready to go.

628
01:05:29,823 --> 01:05:30,741
See?

629
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:33,994
What do you think?

630
01:05:35,037 --> 01:05:36,163
Proper job, no?

631
01:05:38,373 --> 01:05:41,460
- What do I owe you?
- Don’t worry, man.

632
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:44,004
Let me at least
pay for the materials.

633
01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:47,424
Tell me what I owe you.

634
01:05:50,135 --> 01:05:52,596
Can you spot me
for the expenses?

635
01:05:52,638 --> 01:05:55,015
My nets got damaged
a couple days ago.

636
01:05:55,057 --> 01:05:56,225
Someone slashed them.

637
01:05:59,144 --> 01:06:00,604
Yours too?

638
01:06:00,646 --> 01:06:04,316
- Heard anything about it?
- The others were talking but...

639
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:07,361
- Yeah, they screwed us all.
- The work you did here is great.

640
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:09,571
- Pretty good, huh?
- You can hardly tell.

641
01:06:09,613 --> 01:06:12,324
Now you have a brand new luzzu.

642
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:13,617
Strong as ever.

643
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:17,454
Hey there, little sailor.

644
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:22,709
I just need your signature now.

645
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:25,212
What do you think, boss?

646
01:06:25,254 --> 01:06:27,422
Shall we do it, Jes’?

647
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:31,760
Take off his sock for me.

648
01:06:36,515 --> 01:06:39,893
Come here, little jellyfish.

649
01:06:39,935 --> 01:06:41,687
Turn his foot around.

650
01:06:45,107 --> 01:06:47,192
He’s ticklish.

651
01:06:47,234 --> 01:06:50,988
Let’s do it here.
Like the other one.

652
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:52,864
Quick, before the paint dries.

653
01:07:00,914 --> 01:07:04,084
Wow, it came out really good!

654
01:07:04,126 --> 01:07:06,837
Your feet were bigger at his age.

655
01:07:24,229 --> 01:07:26,273
One hundred days old, already?

656
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:28,984
They grow fast, don’t they?

657
01:07:29,026 --> 01:07:30,569
I’ve been meaning to ask you...

658
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:34,448
Did you eat pears when
you were pregnant with Aiden?

659
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:35,574
Don’t think so.

660
01:07:35,616 --> 01:07:37,868
Pears are a huge problem for boys.

661
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:40,871
- Did she actually say pears?
- Yes, of course, pears!

662
01:07:40,913 --> 01:07:42,873
If you had asked your mum,
she’d have told you.

663
01:07:42,915 --> 01:07:47,002
Pears are sandy in texture.
It causes problems when they pee.

664
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,045
Only boys.

665
01:07:48,086 --> 01:07:50,631
Maybe that’s Aiden’s problem.

666
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,758
- Maybe.
- Ask her.

667
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:55,677
How long till this is over?

668
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:57,638
C’mon, it won’t kill you.

669
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,473
- The furniture shop?
- That’s right.

670
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:02,517
Listen, if you ever need a job...

671
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,853
they’re always looking for movers.

672
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:06,438
Movers?

673
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,317
Movers are people like you.
Strong.

674
01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:12,860
Men that can carry furniture.

675
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:19,201
First one, go ahead.

676
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:23,454
Wow, how cute.

677
01:08:23,497 --> 01:08:25,457
Look at this Jes’, how cute.

678
01:08:25,498 --> 01:08:29,753
These will keep him warm,
the sole is leather.

679
01:08:29,795 --> 01:08:33,422
You can tell.
They look really sweet!

680
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:35,759
Time for the big one.

681
01:08:43,141 --> 01:08:45,519
Look at the quality.

682
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:47,436
- Who’s this from?
- From me.

683
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:49,439
- I hope you like it.
- Sure.

684
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,275
It matches the one we have.

685
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:53,860
I can swap it if you want.

686
01:08:53,902 --> 01:08:56,279
Swap it? There’s no need.

687
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,074
We’d know these things if you
hadn’t buried your heads in the sand.

688
01:09:00,117 --> 01:09:02,327
- Come on.
- Isn’t it true?

689
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:04,871
We don’t know how
you two are living.

690
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:06,873
Maybe we like the sand.

691
01:09:06,915 --> 01:09:10,085
- No one likes sand.
- What are we even talking about?

692
01:09:10,127 --> 01:09:11,712
I think the sand is a metaphor.

693
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:14,463
When you were young,
it was okay to just take off.

694
01:09:14,506 --> 01:09:16,216
- Who’s taking off?
- Jes’!

695
01:09:16,257 --> 01:09:19,386
Cruising on the boat everyday,
barbecues in the evening.

696
01:09:19,427 --> 01:09:21,221
Sell a fish every now and then.

697
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:23,390
Do you ever think about your son?

698
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:26,351
- Let’s drop it.
- No, let her tell us.

699
01:09:26,393 --> 01:09:28,604
Come on, enlighten us.

700
01:09:28,645 --> 01:09:31,230
Fishing is a nice way
to waste a summer.

701
01:09:33,108 --> 01:09:35,235
This is a nice way
to waste a life.

702
01:09:38,363 --> 01:09:41,158
Sometimes they disagree
with the mother-in-law.

703
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,618
They’re young.

704
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:45,120
He’ll see things my way.
Mark my words.

705
01:09:45,162 --> 01:09:47,915
Best to stay quiet and say nothing.

706
01:09:47,956 --> 01:09:52,753
You can’t not give them advice.
Anyway, let’s open the rest.

707
01:09:52,794 --> 01:09:54,838
I’ll open it instead of them.

708
01:10:02,387 --> 01:10:03,347
Leave it.

709
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:07,768
- Leave it!
- Why?

710
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:10,062
We’re gonna go through this
again?

711
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:16,985
Look, I don’t expect you to change.
I’ve made it so you can be like this.

712
01:10:17,027 --> 01:10:19,112
Like what?

713
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:23,825
The only reason you can still fish
is because of those people out there.

714
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:27,079
- This about the job with your uncle?
- Not just the job.

715
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,999
Who knows how many times we barely
have enough money for rent.

716
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:34,127
Bill after bill comes in,
we don’t have cash,

717
01:10:34,169 --> 01:10:37,130
and then suddenly,
money magically appears.

718
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:38,090
What are you saying?

719
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:40,759
Where do you think
that money comes from?

720
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:48,016
Do you want him
to grow up like you?

721
01:10:52,104 --> 01:10:53,814
Go get him.

722
01:10:57,776 --> 01:11:00,320
Can you get him so we can leave?

723
01:11:00,362 --> 01:11:02,531
Aiden and I are staying.

724
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:04,741
Again?

725
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:07,869
When there’s a problem,
you run to your mother.

726
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:10,998
I can’t do that.
I have to solve my problems myself.

727
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:15,210
Tell me the truth...

728
01:11:15,252 --> 01:11:18,463
Did you ever believe
you and I would make it?

729
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,469
Another holiday at your mum’s?

730
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:26,638
Maybe I’ll get used to it.

731
01:12:33,497 --> 01:12:39,461
<i>Fisheries and Sea Authority</i>

732
01:12:39,503 --> 01:12:40,796
Name?

733
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:44,007
Jesmark Saliba.

734
01:12:44,049 --> 01:12:45,842
Your boat’s name.

735
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:49,221
<i>Ta’ Palma.</i>

736
01:12:49,263 --> 01:12:51,765
- That’s an old luzzu.
- Yeah.

737
01:12:54,142 --> 01:12:56,186
Length?

738
01:12:56,228 --> 01:12:57,854
Twelve footer.

739
01:12:59,356 --> 01:13:01,066
Material?

740
01:13:01,108 --> 01:13:02,985
Wood, obviously.

741
01:13:04,903 --> 01:13:06,530
Your licence?

742
01:13:07,656 --> 01:13:09,908
Trammel nets and long lines.

743
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:17,207
How old is it?

744
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:19,001
Dunno.

745
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:22,879
If you had to take a guess?

746
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:26,341
It was my dad’s, my grandfather’s,
my great-grandfather’s...

747
01:13:26,383 --> 01:13:27,676
Okay, that’s enough.

748
01:13:30,512 --> 01:13:35,767
"Permanent Cessation
of Fishing Activities"

749
01:13:35,809 --> 01:13:39,396
Do you understand what that means?

750
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:43,775
The financing for this program
comes from the European Union.

751
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:51,325
The goal is to reduce the fishing fleet
and move fishermen

752
01:13:51,366 --> 01:13:55,203
into other industries.

753
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:58,081
Now, according to the
information here,

754
01:13:58,123 --> 01:14:02,669
we come up with an estimate
for your compensation.

755
01:14:05,505 --> 01:14:07,341
How much is it?

756
01:14:08,675 --> 01:14:11,637
You need to decommission
the luzzu first

757
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:15,891
before we can complete
this application.

758
01:14:15,933 --> 01:14:18,227
Do you understand?

759
01:14:18,268 --> 01:14:20,145
Just tell me how much.

760
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:49,007
Seven thousand.

761
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:53,554
You won’t even get ten percent
of that selling it online.

762
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,014
As I told you,

763
01:14:56,056 --> 01:14:57,766
take a training program.

764
01:14:57,808 --> 01:15:00,060
Make an investment.

765
01:15:00,102 --> 01:15:01,478
It’s up to you.

766
01:15:04,398 --> 01:15:05,607
Listen, my friend.

767
01:15:05,649 --> 01:15:09,361
When you decide what you’re
going to do, give me a call.

768
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:25,335
Next!

769
01:16:30,609 --> 01:16:32,194
Look, it’s Jesmark!

770
01:16:33,862 --> 01:16:37,783
- Is it ready yet?
- Yeah, it’s ready.

771
01:16:37,824 --> 01:16:40,744
Let’s have a blessing then.

772
01:16:40,786 --> 01:16:45,457
- Don’t go out of your way.
- It’ll only take a minute.

773
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:48,293
- Another time, thanks anyway.
- Now that it’s fixed up?

774
01:16:48,335 --> 01:16:50,003
Come, I’ll bless it.

775
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,095
God, bless this fisherman’s boat.

776
01:16:58,136 --> 01:17:00,847
Deliver him from danger.

777
01:17:00,889 --> 01:17:03,850
Fill his nets,
and return him home safely.

778
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:23,745
Grab it, Jes’.

779
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:04,202
Let’s have a look.

780
01:18:12,669 --> 01:18:15,464
See what a nice job
I’ve done for you?

781
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:18,467
That silicone caulking
works wonders, huh?

782
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,013
Not a drop of water coming in.

783
01:18:23,055 --> 01:18:23,805
Happy?

784
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:26,308
Yes.

785
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:50,874
Jesmark Saliba.

786
01:18:53,919 --> 01:18:55,254
Tomorrow.

787
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:41,008
All good?

788
01:19:42,259 --> 01:19:45,012
Yeah, except for your shirt.

789
01:19:45,053 --> 01:19:46,138
Carla...

790
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:15,626
You got it from here?

791
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:21,006
- Ready?
- Yeah, I got it.

792
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,762
Hey.

793
01:20:26,803 --> 01:20:28,472
No worries, right?

794
01:20:33,477 --> 01:20:34,895
Thanks, man.

795
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:16,622
- Fishing licence and chain of title.
- Did you remove the engine?

796
01:22:16,663 --> 01:22:17,748
Yes.

797
01:22:17,789 --> 01:22:20,834
- Gearbox and the rest?
- Everything’s ready.

798
01:22:20,876 --> 01:22:21,877
Good.

799
01:22:33,513 --> 01:22:34,932
Good luck.

800
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,732
What name do you give your child?

801
01:23:25,774 --> 01:23:27,568
- Aiden.
- Aiden.

802
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:29,861
What do you wish for Aiden?

803
01:23:29,903 --> 01:23:31,738
- Eternal life.
- Eternal life.

804
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:35,742
You have asked for your
child to be baptized.

805
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:39,788
You will raise your son
in the faith of the Church

806
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:43,083
to follow the commandments,
and to love God and his neighbor

807
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:45,210
as Christ taught us.

808
01:23:45,252 --> 01:23:47,504
Do you understand
what you are undertaking?

809
01:23:47,546 --> 01:23:49,631
- We do.
- We do.

810
01:23:49,673 --> 01:23:55,888
Let us pray to our Lord Almighty,
to let this child be reborn

811
01:23:55,929 --> 01:23:58,473
in water and the Holy Spirit.

812
01:24:01,643 --> 01:24:02,978
Aiden...

813
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,315
I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

814
01:24:06,356 --> 01:24:08,358
the Son,

815
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,068
and the Holy Spirit.

816
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:24,166
Take some photos of them.

817
01:24:27,502 --> 01:24:30,213
Squeeze in, let me take a photo.

818
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:31,632
A bit more.

819
01:24:33,383 --> 01:24:35,469
Jesmark...

820
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:40,224
Jesmark, one minute here, please.
And turn the baby around.

821
01:24:40,265 --> 01:24:42,976
Hold, hold.
Give me a second.

822
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,318
Aiden’s here.

823
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,988
- Is that good?
- Average, as he should be.

824
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:56,990
Now is one of the most exciting stages.

825
01:24:57,032 --> 01:25:00,619
He’ll begin recognising your voices,
making eye contact.

826
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:03,247
We call this stage "hatching."

827
01:25:03,288 --> 01:25:06,458
Even his personality starts to
develop.

828
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:10,504
Everything around Aiden will affect him,
including who you are as individuals.

829
01:25:10,545 --> 01:25:13,548
Do you ever talk to him,
Jesmark?

830
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:17,135
Talk to him?

831
01:25:17,177 --> 01:25:20,472
Tell him a story,
even if it’s something simple.

832
01:25:20,514 --> 01:25:22,724
Talk about your day,
what you’re doing.

833
01:25:24,017 --> 01:25:26,311
It’s important to talk to him.

834
01:25:26,353 --> 01:25:29,982
It’ll help him develop
his language skills later on...

835
01:25:59,052 --> 01:26:02,556
- Is the freezer okay?
- Fixed. Better than it ever was.

836
01:26:06,476 --> 01:26:07,728
Good.

837
01:26:10,022 --> 01:26:13,442
- You could have washed it.
- It costs extra for that.

838
01:26:20,115 --> 01:26:22,868
Take good care of it.
It served me well.

839
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:38,884
Relax, my van’s loaded.

840
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:42,346
What’s worrying you?
We’ll make the shipment on time.

841
01:26:42,387 --> 01:26:43,513
Gotta go.

842
01:26:54,858 --> 01:26:56,610
You’re all set, brother.

843
01:26:56,652 --> 01:26:57,861
Nice job.

844
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:00,572
That’s thick!

845
01:27:00,614 --> 01:27:02,324
That’s the spice.

846
01:27:02,366 --> 01:27:04,076
Fuck you, fucker!

847
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,776
So, once there was a boat.

848
01:27:40,362 --> 01:27:43,073
It didn’t belong to anyone.

849
01:27:43,115 --> 01:27:46,159
At the same time,
it belonged to everyone.

850
01:27:47,494 --> 01:27:49,997
It caught a lot of fish
for the village.

851
01:28:08,056 --> 01:28:12,311
Eventually, the boat needed
to be retired.

852
01:28:14,229 --> 01:28:18,859
They kept it in the village square,
like a monument.

853
01:28:23,238 --> 01:28:26,783
Over time, this boat was falling apart.

854
01:28:30,662 --> 01:28:34,625
They replaced each broken piece
with a new one.

855
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:36,627
Made it strong.

856
01:28:38,503 --> 01:28:41,214
By the end,

857
01:28:41,256 --> 01:28:44,009
every single piece had been
replaced.

858
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:50,182
Now, if you change
every piece of a boat...

859
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,394
Is it still the same boat?

860
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:58,899
And if not...

861
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,110
What does it become?

862
01:29:18,043 --> 01:29:19,211
What’s up?

863
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:22,047
Nothing.
Can I meet you at home?

864
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:30,699
Nothing’s biting today.

865
01:30:33,368 --> 01:30:35,162
Nothing’s biting!

866
