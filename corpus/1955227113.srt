1
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,614
[***]

2
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,151
I don't need to tell you
what's at stake here.

3
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,485
We just have to
run the clock out,

4
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,686
Let it go into overtime.

5
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,455
But coach, we never went
into overtime.

6
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,689
This is for the finals.

7
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,525
Bridgette, when you're coach,
you can call all the shots.

8
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,827
Now just do what I'm
telling you. Sticks up!

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,130
Laurels on three.
One, two, three.

10
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,431
[Together]
Laurels!

11
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,467
[***]

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,503
[Crowd noise]

13
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,857
Whoa!

14
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,460
[Crowd cheering]

15
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,668
Miss, Miss Cunningham.

16
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,536
You're back
from your sabbatical.

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,273
Where did you go,
if I may ask?

18
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:51,279
They said you'd gone to Asia,
is that correct?

19
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,647
Oh well.
Three years.

20
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,184
I bet you know
fluent Mandarin.

21
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,152
Who is that young lady,
the captain?

22
00:01:58,186 --> 00:01:59,420
Oh.

23
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,890
You have been gone awhile.
That is Bridgette.

24
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,332
Whoa!

25
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,406
Hey, Sharkies...

26
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,742
Woo!

27
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,545
[Chuckles]

28
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,481
That was so fun!

29
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:31,185
Hey, clean yourself up.

30
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,653
Hi, Candace.
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,456
Shouldn't you be shaking hands
and kissing babies?

32
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,558
Headmaster York
wants to see us.

33
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,640
Ah.

34
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,712
Thank you for coming in,
Miss Berwitt.

35
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,614
Of course, Headmaster York.

36
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,618
You must be very busy
with your campaign heating up.

37
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,588
Oh, it's heating up a bit,
but I feel confident.

38
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,358
- Thank you for asking.
- Is this about me?

39
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,725
Or my mother?

40
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,963
A flippant attitude
may serve you well

41
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,998
In some circles, Miss Berwitt,

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,534
But it's not
in your best interests here.

43
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,937
Look, I'm sorry
about the Sharks Suck thing.

44
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,674
Sharks suck?

45
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,276
Well, they do.

46
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,711
Yet another note
of disappointment.

47
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:38,018
Miss Berwitt, part of my job
here is protecting Edgington.

48
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,656
If we let someone slide by,
it devalues everyone's diploma.

49
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,024
[Bridgette]
And?

50
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,427
And...

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,331
I have your five-week
progress report.

52
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:54,335
You are failing
both English and calculus.

53
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,504
That's what this is about?

54
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,039
I'll just get a tutor, or
I'll do some extra credit.

55
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,708
Whatever.

56
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,044
I'm afraid it's not quite
that simple here at Edgington,

57
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,815
Especially with
core classes like these.

58
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,519
I have no choice but to
place you on academic probation.

59
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,654
Students on academic probation

60
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,657
May not participate
in extracurricular activities

61
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,626
Including sports,

62
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,963
Which I'm afraid
means no lacrosse.

63
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,666
What? But we just kicked
St. Paul's butt,

64
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,335
And we win the playoffs
next week

65
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,703
And we go to nationals!
I'm the captain,

66
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,639
And tryouts for Eurotour
are coming up.

67
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,041
I could get a scholarship.
You can't take me off the team!

68
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:38,712
All of that is a distant
second to your education.

69
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,749
Your studies come first.
Full stop.

70
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,919
We understand,

71
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,389
And we couldn't
agree with you more.

72
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,823
Headmaster York:
Good,

73
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,825
Because the alternative
is not very pleasant.

74
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,862
If you are not mastering
these classes by midterms,

75
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,931
You will not graduate
from Edgington.

76
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,668
We have a decades-long
track record of excellence.

77
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,070
We do not tolerate failure.

78
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,939
You will not be allowed
to repeat your senior year

79
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,708
At this institution.

80
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:13,514
I know it doesn't feel like it,
but this is all up to you.

81
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,451
[Bridgette] Mom, this is
ridiculous, and you know it.

82
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,086
You've got to do something.

83
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,722
I mean, you're chairman of
Edgington's board of directors.

84
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,724
There's absolutely nothing
I can do, Bridgette.

85
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,526
This is one mistake of yours
I cannot fix.

86
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,960
Well, the board won't like it

87
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,996
If we don't make it
to nationals.

88
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,601
What is wrong with you?

89
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,102
Thanks for understanding,
Candace.

90
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,970
York is giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

91
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,439
I know what's really going on.

92
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,741
- Yeah, and what is it?
- Bobby Berry.

93
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,776
Spying on me.
Classy move.

94
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,044
I wouldn't hear things

95
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,913
If you didn't keep giving me
things to hear.

96
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,849
Yeah. Well, I think you're
just jealous I have somebody.

97
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,451
I'm going to ignore that.

98
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:51,719
This is serious, Bridgette.

99
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,487
This is the most serious
it's ever been.

100
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,055
- You cannot fail out.
- I'm not going to!

101
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,724
I know you're not going to

102
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,792
Because you're going
break up with Bobby tonight

103
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,061
So you can focus on your studies
for the rest of the year.

104
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,496
You can't make me do that.

105
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,731
I can tell Coach Ravino

106
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,666
To never let you
on the team again...

107
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,435
And she will listen to me.

108
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,736
Why?

109
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,471
Because I recommended her
to York.

110
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,841
You just have to win
everything, don't you?

111
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,776
[Sighs] Some day
you'll understand

112
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,445
It's not about winning.

113
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,483
Yeah? Well, that's where
you're wrong, Mom.

114
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,052
It's all about winning.

115
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,720
[Door closes]

116
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,092
- [Danni] Oh, hey, roomie.
- Hey.

117
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,561
I was getting worried.

118
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,096
[Bridgette]
It's such a long day!

119
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,532
- What?
- I heard.

120
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,534
We've lost our
fearless leader.

121
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,771
You should know that
you don't have to lie to me.

122
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,105
You know?

123
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,040
Somebody's
on next week's roster.

124
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,444
You were listed as out
on academic probation.

125
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:51,812
It's okay. It's just...

126
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,981
It's senior year.
It's a ridiculously hard school.

127
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,849
It's tough for everyone.

128
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,585
And I already talked
to my study group.

129
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,187
You are totally cool to join.

130
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,623
Even though I made fun
of you guys for being nerds?

131
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,825
We made fun of you for being
too cool for study groups.

132
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,059
[Giggles]

133
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,596
You would have fit right in.

134
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,030
So, who's going to be captain

135
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,900
Now that I'm forced into
temporary retirement?

136
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:18,171
Well, you know they normally
choose a senior,

137
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:21,174
And someone who's really good
with the plays...

138
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,777
So...

139
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:28,649
That's awesome!
You'll do a great job.

140
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,017
Thank you!

141
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,119
Here to fix your laptop,
ma'am.

142
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,921
Oh my God, you're crazy!

143
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,656
How did you get past
the front desk?

144
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,125
Visiting hours do not apply
to the computer technicians.

145
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,260
- Hi, Danni.
- Hi, Bobby.

146
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,563
Could you give us a minute?

147
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,732
Oh, yeah. Sure.

148
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,066
Wouldn't want to get in the way

149
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,868
Of getting your lap
or your top serviced.

150
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,069
Oh my God!

151
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,838
Have fun, you guys!

152
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,910
My mom dropped a huge bomb.

153
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,912
What is it?

154
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,081
She said
I can't see you anymore.

155
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,683
What? Why?

156
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,586
She thinks it's your fault.

157
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,755
This is ridiculous.
[sighs]

158
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,192
What does this mean?

159
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,963
Two months of calls and sexting
until you get your GPA up?

160
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,765
Not even.

161
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,200
My mom's like a detective.
She watches the phone bill.

162
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,908
So this is it?

163
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,943
Just like that.

164
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,881
Tonight is our last night?

165
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,116
Danni?

166
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,853
Miss Berwitt...

167
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,155
I heard you were having
some computer issues.

168
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,692
Well, um, yeah.
He was just finishing.

169
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,928
That should get your hard drive
up and running, ma'am.

170
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,163
Call me if you need
any more assistance.

171
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,138
I didn't know Mr. Berry
moonlights as a technician.

172
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,274
He seems to possess
an enviable list of skills.

173
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,976
Oh, is that guy
a student here, too?

174
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,711
I didn't know.

175
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,851
Is there something else?

176
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:47,354
You do know who I am,
don't you?

177
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,923
I'm your new
faculty resident.

178
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,960
Oh. Are you going to
report this?

179
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,996
I'm kind of in a lot of
hot water already.

180
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,731
I know.

181
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,635
[Door closes]

182
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,138
[Bell rings]

183
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,346
Oh my God!

184
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,016
Are you actually
reading a book?

185
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,985
Don't we have a quiz
on this today?

186
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,953
Which one is this?

187
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,322
No, no. It's not this one.
That's the old one.

188
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,425
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

189
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,627
- [Giggles]
- Oh, my God. You're crazy!

190
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,806
Where's Miss Patterson?

191
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,912
I was called back early
from my sabbatical to take over,

192
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:48,348
While Mrs. Patterson
is on maternity leave.

193
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,183
My name is Jane Cunningham.

194
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,119
Miss Patterson is pregnant?

195
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:57,725
Yes... and suffering
extreme morning sickness.

196
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,160
She'll be on bed rest
for the remainder of her term.

197
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,696
Any more questions?

198
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,931
Good!

199
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:13,040
Point of view.

200
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,442
Was your reading assignment
last night

201
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,478
Written in the third person
or omniscient point of view?

202
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,113
Bridgette.

203
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,987
Um, I mean,
it's the same thing, right?

204
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,023
Bridgette's heart
began to race.

205
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:33,761
She wasn't used to
not knowing the answer...

206
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,129
Or rather
she did know the answer,

207
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,366
But she had too much pride
to risk getting it wrong,

208
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,970
And so remained silent.

209
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,905
That's actually
third person limited.

210
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,373
We know the thoughts
of one person,

211
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,475
And the story
is centered around them.

212
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,844
If you wanted
an omniscient point of view,

213
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,846
You can get into
someone else's thoughts, too.

214
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,949
For example,
Bridgette looked over at Danni

215
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,317
And mouthed "help me".

216
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,086
Danni, who's known for
being a smart ass

217
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,487
Came up with
a self-aware response

218
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,756
That only betrayed
her deep-rooted fear

219
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,225
Of taking things
far too seriously.

220
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,028
Aren't you clever?

221
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,830
You're correct,

222
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,199
But mind your language
in my classroom.

223
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,203
Understood?
All right, then.

224
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,771
Mrs. Paterson
wanted to make sure

225
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,974
You got last week's exams
returned to you.

226
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:25,378
Apparently you all have issues
distinguishing points of view.

227
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,285
Hey, it's okay.
I got you.

228
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,021
Don't worry about it.

229
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,995
[Bell rings]

230
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,538
Miss Berwitt.

231
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,908
May I see you a moment?

232
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,816
Look, I... I know
I'm not supposed to see Bobby.

233
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,952
It won't happen again.

234
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,388
I'd just really appreciate it
if you didn't tell my mom.

235
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,157
Tell her what exactly?

236
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,893
You had your computer
repaired.

237
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,362
How did you feel about
the questions on the test?

238
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,598
Well, clearly I missed
the boat on a lot of them.

239
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,600
Yes. The thing about
Mrs. Patterson, the dear,

240
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,335
Is that she's very ambiguous

241
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,138
When it comes
to asking questions.

242
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,806
May I?

243
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,916
Ah, yes. See?

244
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,418
This question is open
to interpretation,

245
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,054
The timeline is skewed here,

246
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:45,425
And this last one is strictly
subjective opinion.

247
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,376
Come by my office before
first period tomorrow morning...

248
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,178
7:45.

249
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,539
[Door opens]

250
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,166
You're late.

251
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,501
And so are you.

252
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,003
Miss Cunningham:
Sit down.

253
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,510
So, tell me about Bobby.

254
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,744
You work here.

255
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,247
Why don't you
look up his record?

256
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,349
Tell me about you and Bobby.

257
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,985
Did my mother
put you up to this?

258
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,054
Well, you can tell her
we broke up,

259
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,455
And I won't be
seeing him again.

260
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,590
Do you love him?

261
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,359
Seriously,
what's going on?

262
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,363
I'm just trying to get
to know my new residents.

263
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,999
I really should be
getting to class.

264
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,068
When I was your age,

265
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,770
I was head over heels
in love with my boyfriend.

266
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,173
My parents forbade me
from dating him.

267
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,309
They said he was
a bad influence on me.

268
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,577
Okay.

269
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,281
What happened?

270
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,285
I didn't see him anymore,
and I always regretted it.

271
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,320
You must have
gotten over it by now.

272
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:30,523
Never underestimate the power
of missed opportunity,

273
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,725
No matter how long ago it was.

274
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,066
Are you being responsible?

275
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,333
[Bridgette]
Miss Cunningham,

276
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,302
I don't understand
what you're asking me.

277
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,503
Is he pressuring you?

278
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,205
No, no.

279
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,408
Besides, my mom made it
so that we can't even text.

280
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,312
So, sex isn't exactly
on the table,

281
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,546
Or the bed,
for that matter.

282
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,615
The male libido
is a powerful force,

283
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,751
Second only to its
counterpart, the male ego.

284
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,054
Miss Cunningham,
I'd love to stay and chat,

285
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,190
But I really
should be getting to class.

286
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,159
Apparently,
I'm failing all of them.

287
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,760
You're afraid
he'll lose interest in you

288
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,729
If you don't sleep with him.

289
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,686
Why are you helping me?

290
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,123
That's what friends do
for one another.

291
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,630
[Bridgette][giggles]
All right. I love you, too.

292
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,232
Good night.

293
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,435
Wow, I've never
seen you so happy

294
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,802
Talking to your mom before.

295
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,605
Well, it wasn't my mom.
[giggles]

296
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,274
Well, I know it wasn't Bobby

297
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,110
Since you've been forbidden
to talk to him.

298
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,578
It was Bobby.

299
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,513
[Sighs] Bridgette,
what are you doing?

300
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,714
Nothing.

301
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,283
Do you want to
get in more trouble?

302
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,185
No! I'm not going to get
in trouble

303
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,819
Because my mom
can't trace this.

304
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,521
Why, because
it's from a time

305
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,523
Before call tracing
was invented?

306
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,360
Where did you get
this thing? I never...

307
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,428
Miss Cunningham
gave it to me.

308
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,265
Miss Cunningham?
Why?

309
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,899
So I could talk
to my boyfriend.

310
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,369
Why would Miss Cunningham
care about you and Bobby?

311
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,304
I don't know. Maybe
she has the hots for him.

312
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,772
You can't even
buy these anymore.

313
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,440
She must be like
three times your age!

314
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,708
Oh my gosh!

315
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,577
You know, well,
she does use adult diapers.

316
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,313
[Laugh]

317
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,814
- What is that?
- I don't know.

318
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,422
Miss Berwitt.
It's for you.

319
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,425
Wow!

320
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,162
Please save the date.
Future Elite Party.

321
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,797
- Hey!
- Wow! Okay, okay.

322
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,665
That's sounds
really pretentious.

323
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,267
You're just jealous,
yeah.

324
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,236
We clearly established
that I'm not jealous.

325
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,371
I didn't get one.

326
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,373
Well, clearly you're not
as special as I am.

327
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,175
- Oh, okay.
- I mean, gold envelope.

328
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,311
Okay, gold.
Yeah, here. Catch it.

329
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,513
Work on those reflexes, Elite.

330
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,548
- Oh, okay. Okay.
- Miss Elite.

331
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,710
Yes, Bridgette?

332
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,579
Do you have another copy
of my book?

333
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,614
I think I left mine
in my room.

334
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,718
No, I don't have another copy,
but I do have your copy.

335
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,623
How did you get this?

336
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,294
I found it on the floor
after class.

337
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,262
It must be yours, right?

338
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,331
Yeah. Thanks.

339
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:42,742
You didn't happen to find
a bookmark in here, did you?

340
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:47,314
No. I'm sorry
you lost your place.

341
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,341
[Bridgette]
Who... who is this?

342
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,775
That's me.

343
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,510
Really?

344
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,447
Yes. Quite the homely
little thing, wasn't I?

345
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,648
No, not at all.

346
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:25,418
Just not what I was expecting.

347
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,455
I'll take that
as a compliment.

348
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,591
So, you had something
on your mind?

349
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,993
Yeah.

350
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,662
You wrote notes
in my book.

351
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,330
Yes.

352
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,400
Not just notes...
the answers.

353
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:46,339
My dear, I think
you're old enough to hear this.

354
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,508
Life isn't fair.

355
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,742
Oh, I think I know that.

356
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,379
Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

357
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,614
This world is built
by the people on the inside.

358
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,684
A little advantage can mean
the difference between

359
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:00,920
Living a common,
unremarkable life

360
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,423
And a life that can
change the world.

361
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,625
I'm not trying to change
the world, Miss Cunningham.

362
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,394
I'm just trying to
get back on the team

363
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,095
And see my boyfriend.

364
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,763
Yes, that's all
well and good,

365
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:14,367
But there's a bigger picture
here, don't you see?

366
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:17,704
It's about claiming
what is yours, Bridgette.

367
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,706
You can't just wait for it
to come to you.

368
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,574
You've got to
reach out and grab it,

369
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,743
Grab what's rightfully yours,
yours by birth.

370
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:31,951
With a little help,
you can have everything...

371
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,587
And I'm that little help.

372
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,457
Really?

373
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,795
Don't imagine for a second
this doesn't happen everywhere,

374
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,731
Including Edgington Academy.

375
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,834
How do you think we have such
a flawless graduation record?

376
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,169
You'd be amazed to know
the names of others

377
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,104
Who have had help making it

378
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,006
Through the rigors
of this environment.

379
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,509
Like whom?

380
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,578
Do you really think
top college football stars

381
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:02,982
Are graduating unassisted?
Not a chance.

382
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,052
Their focus is elsewhere,
as should yours be.

383
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,789
Why me? I mean,
why are you doing this for me?

384
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,492
Because I see myself
in you, Bridgette,

385
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,694
And I don't want you
to end up like me.

386
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,496
We both deserve
better than that.

387
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,631
But you're a teacher
at one of the most prestigious

388
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:19,966
Private schools
in the world.

389
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,702
Yes, well, even then

390
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,471
I'm just teaching babies
to color

391
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,972
And toddlers to count.

392
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:29,709
So I'm just a toddler
to you?

393
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,511
Quite the opposite.

394
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,781
You're a young woman
full of great promise.

395
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:38,551
You are the exception
to every rule.

396
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,919
People like you are rare,

397
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,555
But I know greatness
when I see it.

398
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,891
We all have a purpose
in this life.

399
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,225
You were meant to lead others,

400
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,960
And I was meant to help
people like you

401
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,062
Become the leaders
you were born to be.

402
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,131
That's just the way it is.

403
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,936
[Snickers]
Huh.

404
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,555
Birth control pills?

405
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,691
I hope I'll be seeing you
for the Future Elite Party

406
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,694
In a couple of weeks.
Bobby will be there, too.

407
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,896
It's sure to be
a memorable evening.

408
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,990
[Door opens]
Oh! You scared me.

409
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,258
Sorry.

410
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,194
Working on your English essay?

411
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,596
Yeah.

412
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,064
Wow, you wrote
a lot of notes.

413
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,600
Yeah, yeah. I did.

414
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,368
Okay.

415
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,705
No, I'm just...
I'm glad to see you're, like,

416
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,273
Taking it seriously.

417
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,708
Don't sound so surprised.

418
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,343
[Laugh]

419
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,178
Ow!

420
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,847
What's the matter?

421
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,081
Oh, nothing, nothing.

422
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,150
You hurt your shoulder
at practice?

423
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:27,019
Not exactly.

424
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,821
You got your Laurels tattoos
without me?

425
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,957
It's tradition to get them
before the semifinals.

426
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,258
I tried to find you,

427
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,226
But you didn't even come
to watch us practice.

428
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,895
I was studying.

429
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,265
Studying or spending time
with your new BFF?

430
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:40,933
Studying.

431
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,936
Look, I tried.
I'm sorry.

432
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,905
But I'm the captain.

433
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,845
We can get them together
when you're back on the team.

434
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,246
Whatever.

435
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,319
So, late night dining hall?

436
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,791
[Bridgette]
I have work to do.

437
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,192
All right.

438
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,230
Good luck.

439
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,262
A-plus?

440
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,098
Yeah.
What did you get?

441
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,434
A-minus.

442
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,837
That's great.

443
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,440
We both worked
really, really hard.

444
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,323
[Horn blows]

445
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,077
[Candace]
I'm so proud of you.

446
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,278
Thanks.

447
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,080
You keep this up,

448
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,282
And you can have your choice
of any university.

449
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:41,020
Applications are due soon,
you know.

450
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,421
Yeah, I know.

451
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,461
Hey, Mom, do you know this
new teacher Jane Cunningham?

452
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,432
Who?

453
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,001
Jane Cunningham.

454
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,535
She's filling in
for Miss Patterson,

455
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,270
While she's on
maternity leave.

456
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,141
Miss Patterson is pregnant?

457
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,014
Apparently.

458
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:17,790
[***]

459
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,792
Yes, yes.

460
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,795
Look, Bradley,
I have to go.

461
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:26,332
Yes, really, because
my boss just walked in!

462
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,100
Okay.

463
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,469
[Sighs]

464
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,972
How do they expect you
to get good grades,

465
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:36,976
Have extracurricular activities,
and college applications?

466
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,811
It's barbaric!

467
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,379
I don't even know
how I'm going to write

468
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,381
This personal statement,
whatever it is.

469
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,083
Okay. Let me see.

470
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:51,290
Ah, sum up your entire
purpose in life,

471
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,558
One page, single spaced,

472
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,460
At a time you're struggling
to figure out

473
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,995
Who you are for yourself.

474
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,130
[Snigger]
Yeah.

475
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:01,100
Well, what are you
most proud of?

476
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,368
Lacrosse, I guess.

477
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,036
Hmmm.

478
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,105
Must be hard for you
not being on the team.

479
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,607
[Grunts] Yeah, well,
I've only been gone

480
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,410
A couple of weeks, and
it's like I never existed.

481
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,380
I mean, they got their
Laurels tattoos without me.

482
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,116
Those traitors!

483
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,985
Yeah.

484
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,853
Hey...

485
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,490
Let's you and I go together.
I've always wanted a tattoo.

486
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:25,892
Seriously?

487
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,393
What? Do you think
I'm too old for one?

488
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,261
No, no, no.
Of course not.

489
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,596
Then it's settled!

490
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,631
Right after we finish
your personal statement,

491
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,300
We're getting inked.

492
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,369
[Laugh] Great!
Well, how long will this take?

493
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,605
Not long
if we put our minds to it.

494
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:44,176
So, tell me more about
your proudest accomplishments.

495
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,545
I guess
I'd start with lacrosse.

496
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:51,217
Miss Cunningham: Athletics,
like war, is an art.

497
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,154
If you excel at one, who knows
what interests lie dormant?

498
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,325
When you're ready,
then we can add some leaves

499
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,227
Or add some petals.

500
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,978
[Applause]

501
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:25,551
Remember, thick to thin.

502
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,929
[Door opens and closes]

503
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,337
How was practice?

504
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,107
Good.

505
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,210
Are you handling
everything all right?

506
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,980
What do you mean?

507
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:56,015
Captain
is a stressful position.

508
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,256
You have to be a leader.

509
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,126
All the girls are looking to you
to set a healthy tone.

510
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,129
It's not easy.

511
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,301
Danni?

512
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,969
[Danni]
Just go to your party.

513
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,321
Oh, wow, that's awesome!

514
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,491
Miss Cunningham: The head
of admissions at Swarthmore

515
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,160
Is actually
a good friend of mine.

516
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,595
So let me speak to her
and see what I can do.

517
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,668
If they were any closer,
I'd have to write them up

518
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,371
For inappropriate
display of affection.

519
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,373
No, they're just friends.

520
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,644
A man's body, no matter
how faithful his heart,

521
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:02,614
Is powerless against
a pretty girl in a tight dress.

522
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,751
Have you been taking
the pills I gave you?

523
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,153
It's been two weeks now.

524
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,255
Oh, I don't know
if I'm ready for that.

525
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,589
Oh, if you're not,

526
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,225
Little Miss Buxom over there
most certainly is.

527
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,666
I have another engagement
later this evening.

528
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:24,403
It would be a shame to let
an empty apartment go to waste.

529
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,144

530
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,822
Where's Miss Cunningham?

531
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,457
She's out of the night.

532
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:49,161
She... said we could use
her apartment.

533
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:52,264
And use it for what?

534
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:55,234
For whatever.

535
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:59,538
Don't you think
she's a little too into you?

536
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,108
Not as into me
as you're about to be.

537
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:10,349
[***]

538
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,319
Wait.

539
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,454
Are you sure you're ready?

540
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,193
Do you love me?

541
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,130
Of course, I do.

542
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,135
Then show me.

543
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:52,858
Oh!

544
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,594
Oh, Miss Cunningham.
Uh, I'm sorry.

545
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,597
I didn't know
anyone was in here.

546
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,734
I just finished whipping up
the calculus exam.

547
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,737
It's straightforward, but I...

548
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:10,376
It's subtle in its
competency... assessment.

549
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,879
I just came to get my lunch bag
out of the fridge

550
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,582
Before the drive home.

551
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,797
Oh!

552
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,799
I knew there was something
different about you

553
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,334
The other day.

554
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,635
What?

555
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,806
It's the beard.

556
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:46,545
You didn't have it
before, did you?

557
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:50,816
Um, no, I... I had it, actually.
I've always had it.

558
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,421
I think it gives me a certain,
you know, professorial thing.

559

Oh God!

[Breathing heavily]
You are so sexy.

563
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,408
You are so sexy.
Oh, my God.

564
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:18,577
I can't believe it.

565
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,945
You're so sexy.

566
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,250
- Do you love me?
- What?

567
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,285
Do you love me?

568
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,854
Yes, yes, I love you.

569
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,756
Then show me.

570
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,259
Oh!
[grunts] Oh!

571
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,227
[Door opens and closes]

572
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,569
You're still here!
Is he?

573
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,505
Oh, no.
He left a while ago.

574
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,340
I just thought
I'd clean up a bit.

575
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,544
So, how was it?

576
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,781
[Chuckle] Uh, thanks
for making it happen.

577
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,517
Here's your key back.

578
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,786
Keep it.
Mi casa es su casa.

579
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,822
Got a little something
else to give you.

580
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,426
What is that?

581
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,961
Your calculus midterm.

582
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,397
- Uh...
- What's wrong?

583
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,366
I'm not sure
this feels right.

584
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,601
I don't think you understand
just how far I had to go

585
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:50,969
To get that for you.

586
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,704
I never asked you
to do that.

587
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,806
I did what I had to do
so you can get your life back

588
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,442
And get on
with your larger purpose.

589
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,377
And I really appreciate
all your help,

590
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,612
But I've been studying.
I can do this.

591
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,314
You want me to
just delete that?

592
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,782
[Bridgette]
Maybe that would be best.

593
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,318
What have we been doing
all this for?

594
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:09,455
None of this matters,
unless we ace this test.

595
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:12,558
That's your chance
for Eurotour...

596
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,860
Your relationship with
your mother and with Bobby.

597
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,695
You won't be allowed
to see him ever again

598
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,464
If you fail, remember?

599
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:22,901
We've got everything we need
to ace this exam right here.

600
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,607
I guess I was wrong
about you.

601
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,841
Wait!

602
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,677
Yes, Bridgette?

603
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,014
Nothing.

Don't stress
if you didn't finish.

608
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,127
Quality over quantity.

609
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,099
Thank you very much.

610
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:04,936
Thank you.

611
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,038
Enjoy the rest
of your afternoon.

612
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,148
Did you lose something?

613
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,151
Yeah, my underwear.

614
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,786
The skimpy red ones?

615
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,589
Yes. You're not
wearing them, are you?

616
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,057
No.

617
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,593
[Giggles]
Hey, well, help me find them.

618
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,529
You know, if I didn't
know any better, I'd say

619
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,897
You and Miss Cunningham are a
little bit more than friends.

620
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,633
Yeah, you caught me.

621
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,901
I'm having an affair
with my English lit teacher.

622
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:13,972
I'm not going to tell anyone,
as long as I can join in.

623
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,574
Into older women, are you?

624
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,209
Hey, when it comes
to a threesome...

625
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,246
Ew! You're disgusting!

626
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,214
Hey, you'd better
get out of here.

627
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,951
I don't want you here
while she's here.

628
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,986
Well...

629
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,056
My parents are driving up
this weekend for my match,

630
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,659
And they'd love to meet you.

631
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,794
I was wondering if you would
like to go to dinner

632
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,129
With my family.

633
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:41,933
Yes, as long as we go
someplace far off campus,

634
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,936
So that Candace
won't find out.

635
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,573
Yeah, sure.

636
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:50,876
No, that's not
what I meant. I just...

637
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,712
I have to get my grades back up
and get her off my back,

638
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,582
And we can show her
what a great catch you are.

639
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:59,084
[Snigger] Okay.

640
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:02,187
I guess I'm okay with that.

641
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,763

Where have you been?

642

Were you with
Miss Cunningham?

00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,740
Not really.

645
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:24,042
What does that mean?

646
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,012
I slept at Jane's,
but she was not there.

What are you talking about?

653
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,233
I know she's been helping you.

is your handwriting

What did you see?

662
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,822
You had a test
that was already filled out.

663
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:12,157
And how would I have that?

664
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,792
You know what,
I don't know,

665
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,827
But I know it has
something to do with her.

666
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,096
She's going to ruin you.

667
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,231
And like I'm the only one
with secrets around here.

668
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,133

supposed to mean?

Hmmm, good afternoon,
Miss Berwitt.

674
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,867
I thought it best
we do this in person.

675
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:07,012
Congratulations, Bridgette.

676
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:10,448
You've made
tremendous strides.

677
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,283
Ah, I read your English essay.

678
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,853
It's masterful,
so on point.

679
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:19,725
And Mr. Jeter was thrilled
with your calculus midterm.

680

I don't remember the last time
I saw a student

681
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,397
Make such a remarkable
turnaround.

682
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:29,367
You've done Edgington proud.

Horace, I know
you're my campaign manager,

685
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,180
But I still call the shots,

686
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,182
And there's no way
I'm going to show my face

687
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:46,451
In support of that woman!

688
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:47,352
No!

689
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,790
Horace, I've got to go.
Bridgette's here.

690
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:58,196
I am so very proud of you.

691
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:02,233
Headmaster York is amazed,
but I am not. Cheers.

692
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,936
I didn't doubt for a second
that you could do this.

00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,105
- You are, after all, a Berwitt.

to have Bobby back in your life.

Thanks.

697

So, why don't you go call him
and tell him the good news,

698
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,918
And I'll start your laundry.

regulate my period.

Don't lie to me!

704
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:08,499
Jane Cunningham
gave you these.

705
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,168
Yeah, but she's just
trying to help.

00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,536
You are never
to see her again.

Well, that's not really
possible, Candace.

708
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,473
She's our faculty resident.

709
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,342
That woman is sick.
Do you understand?

710
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,177
She's a teacher.
She's trying to help me.

711
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,879
She cares about me.

712
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:23,214
Okay. Please, please.
Bridgette, listen to me.

713
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,016
Why do you have to
control everything?

714
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,319
This is not about control.
I am on your side.

715
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:31,156
Jane Cunningham
is on my side.

716
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,024
You just happen to be
my mother.

717
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,870
[Bridgette on computer]
Do you love me?

718
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:47,072
[Bobby on computer]
Of course, I do.

719
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:49,107
[Bridgette on computer]
Then show me.

720
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:57,615
Ahem.

721
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,150
Why are you doing this?

722
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,253
[Jane]
Nice to see you, too, Candy.

723
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,890
We agreed to stay out
of each other's lives.

724
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:06,524
Your daughter came
to me for help.

725
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,460
You call this help?

726
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,329
She took those
from my purse.

727
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,598
She's 17!

728
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,500
I had hoped that your leave

729
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,435
Would have given you
time to think.

730
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:21,472
Oh, I did nothing but think.
Have you ever read Kawabata?

731
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,975
There's a lyrical subtlety
in his native language

732
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,944
That is sadly lost
in translation.

733
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,578
You do know that Edgington
is still paying

734
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:29,380
For Hannah's therapy.

735
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:31,382
She had to put off college
for a year, at least.

736
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:34,052
Am I to be held accountable
for every student

737
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:35,987
With a weak constitution?

738
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,289
I'm getting Bridgette assigned
to another English class

739
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:39,925
And another dorm.

740
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,292
What if she's happy
where she is?

741
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:42,961
We had an agreement, Jane.

742
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:46,331
I'm certainly holding up
my end, Candy.

743
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,535
Stay away from my daughter.

744
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:55,673
She told you that she doesn't
want to stay away, didn't she?

745
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,675
She needs me, Candy,

746
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,577
More than
she's ever needed you,

747
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,546
And you can't stand it.

748
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:05,383
Good to see you, too,
Candace.

749
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,652
Maybe I'll drop
by the house sometime.

750
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,489
[Muted chatter]

751
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:14,059
You can go over five,
or you can...

752
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:17,195
[Jane] Miss Berwitt.
May I see you a moment?

753
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:25,003
[***]

754
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,952
[Jane] Miss Berwitt,
can I see you for a moment?

755
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:44,389
[Laugh] God, I can
so turn the teacher thing on

756
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,224
When I want to, can't I?

757
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,559
So hey, I can't believe

758
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,196
You never came to
tell me the good news.

759
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:53,464
Yeah. Thanks
for all your help.

760
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:54,665
That meant a lot.

761
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,267
It was nothing.

762
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:58,970
So, now that we've
crossed that hurdle,

763
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:01,339
It's time to get back
to those college admissions.

764
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:04,242
The first step is an engaging
personal statement.

765
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,177
We need to work on yours
post-haste,

766
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:07,612
So why don't you
grab your things...

767
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,480
I can't right now.

768
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,116
Well, why not?

769
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:13,251
I'm with my study group,
and it's really important

770
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,519
If I'm going to stay
on the team.

771
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:16,387
You got back on the team
without their help.

772
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,189
You can stay on the team
without their...

773
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:19,390
I just can't right now.

774
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:20,992
Fine! Tonight.

775
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:24,495
I had dinner plans,
but I can cancel them.

776
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,331
I don't need this anymore.

777
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,638
I have to go.

778
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:39,177
[***]

779
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,103
[Knock on door]

780
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:07,072
Jane.

781
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,775
Uh, did your bulb go out?

782
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,577
I could call maintenance.

783
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,780
I was just about to
head over to the cafeteria

784
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:19,317
To get some dinner,
if you'd like to join.

785
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:24,689
I mean,
if you're not too busy.

786
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:29,127
I just thought maybe
we should talk about our...

787
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,028
Well, about us.

788
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:38,436
I can't stop thinking
about the other night...

789
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:41,306
Which was so wonderful.

790
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:51,849
You asked me to express
certain feelings,

791
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,286
And I was just wondering
if that was because

792
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,155
You had similar feelings
towards me.

793
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,456
Okay.

794
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:01,058
Maybe we could
talk about this later.

795
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:05,330
But I have to go.

796
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,666
Uh, sure, sure.
Of course.

797
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:14,172
[Laugh]
Sorry to have interrupted...

798
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,840
Whatever you're doing...

799
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:19,644
In the dark.

800
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,625
[Bobby] So, my parents really
like you, if you can't tell.

801
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:37,462
[Laugh]
I like them, too.

802
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:40,131
Bridgette, what is it?

803
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,435
[Sigh] What if, what if
I don't get into college?

804
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,305
What if I can't make it
outside of Edgington?

805
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:48,673
Says the girl
who just kicked ass

806
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,908
In all of her midterms?

807
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,677
I don't deserve to be here.

808
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:57,282
I was just born
into the right family.

809
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,584
Well, Miss Cunningham
seems to think

810
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,486
That you're pretty special.

811
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,423
Right?

812
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,525
What's going on
between you two?

813
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:13,331
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

814
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,835
Bridgette?

815
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,374
[Phone vibrates]

816
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:30,681
Miss Cunningham?

817
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:32,617
[Jane]
Bridgette, come in!

818
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:36,454
You said
there was an emergency?

819
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,923
Right. College admissions
deadlines are fast approaching,

820
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:41,226
And we need to work on
your personal statement.

821
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,228
- Miss Cunningham...
- Jane.

822
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:44,795
Miss Cunningham,
I really appreciate

823
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,531
Everything you've done for me,

824
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:49,300
But I should really just do
my own college applications.

825
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,769
That's a very mature thing
to say.

826
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:58,376
I think I should start taking
responsibility for myself.

827
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,710
Right.

828
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:04,482
So, tattoos?

829
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:08,986
[Bridgette] Thanks for getting
them all. I'll read them over

830
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,256
And let you know
if I have any questions.

831
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,292
Please have a cookie.

832
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,929
I'd love to, but I...
I have practice in the morning,

833
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:20,865
And I should just get to sleep.

834
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,000
I spent all night
decorating these.

835
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,803
At least take a few back to
the room for you and Danielle.

836
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,280
What is that?

837
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,322
You went without me?

838
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,260
We were supposed to
get those together.

839
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:53,798
It wasn't about you.
It was about my team.

840
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,800
My friends.

841
00:53:57,602 --> 00:54:00,838
[Plate crashing]
[yelling] I am your friend!

842
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,673
When you got
kicked off the team,

843
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,675
They all just went on
with their lives.

844
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,545
I dropped everything for you!

845
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,451
You can't just
walk away from me!

846
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,556
My mother
was right about you.

847
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,258
Bridgette.

848
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,294
[Door closes]

849
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:24,562
Bridgette!

850
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,498
[Yelling]
Bridgette!

851
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:31,869
[Yelling] Bridgette,
come back here!

852
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,604
Bridgette!

853
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:34,905
Bridgette!

854
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,707
[Yelling]
Bridgette!

855
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:02,299
Jane!

856
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:10,441
Um, uh, I was afraid I'd done
something to upset you.

857
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:12,843
Why would you think that?

858
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,345
I don't know.

859
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,350
You know that thing
you wanted to talk about?

860
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:20,585
That thing?

861
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,087
I told you
we could talk about it later?

862
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,622
Okay, I'm ready.

863
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,056
We can talk about it
right now.

864
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,528
Oh, uh, um, well that's...

865
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:32,830
Well that's...

866
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:36,567
Sort of a private matter,
don't you think?

867
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:37,768
No.

868
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,037
Okay. Okay.

869
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:47,412
Um, listen, Jane,

870
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,146
Don't you think
it would be better

871
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,148
If we did this privately?

872
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,918
I mean, maybe
we could have dinner.

873
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,654
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

874
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,724
Why would I have dinner
with you?

875
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02,059
Uh, what?

876
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,161
Do you really think
someone like me

877
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,631
Would go out
with someone like you?

878
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:11,702
You can't dress yourself.
Your breath smells.

879
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:14,739
Your beard is disgusting,
and your hair is falling out.

880
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:19,477
Your penis is minuscule.
No one likes you.

881
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,580
You're only good at one subject,
the most boring subject,

882
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:24,915
And right now you've got

there was a report

I've already tried?

going to believe me?

Miss Cunningham.
It was a setup.

935

She had them put me in jail.

The board and York
believe Bobby is innocent,

966
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,214
And we think
the police will, too.

967
01:01:57,247 --> 01:02:00,117
Of course he's innocent.
She should be the one in jail.

968
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:05,089
She almost was...

969
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:06,323
Once.

970
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:13,898
Her three-year sabbatical
was not voluntary.

971
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:18,335
It was prompted by an alleged
obsession with a student.

972
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,340
So she's done this before.

let her come back?

that would stand up in court.

was to send Jane

until it all blew over,

who was "we"?

can ruin a school, Bridgette,

a choice, Bridgette.

To fire a tenured teacher,

990
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,162
And I can't afford
a scandal now.

991
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:20,064
You don't get it, Mom.

992
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:26,203
It's not just Danni
and Bobby she's after.

993
01:03:30,507 --> 01:03:33,210
Jane's been helping me.

994
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,180
She changed my grades.

995
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:38,115
She wrote the lit essay
for me...

996
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:42,519
And she gave me the answers
to the calculus midterm.

997
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,460
I'm sorry.
I know it was wrong,

998
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,063
But, but I have the essay notes
in her handwriting,

999
01:03:53,097 --> 01:03:56,266
And we can use it as proof
that she cheated.

1000
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,602
Hopefully it's enough
to get her fired,

1001
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,171
Maybe even sent away.

1002
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:06,944
[Sobs]
I'm really sorry.

1003
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:08,478
I know it was wrong.

1004
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,080
I didn't mean
for it to happen.

1005
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:12,482
It just did.

1006
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:17,421
Please say something.
Don't just sit there.

1007
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:21,892
The same thing
happened to me.

1008
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:31,368
Here, at Edgington,
25 years ago.

1009
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:33,203
Oh my God!

1010
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:38,909
Jane always had
a brilliant mind.

1011
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:42,446
Socially inept,
mildly delusional...

1012
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:47,651
But completely brilliant.

1013
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:50,254
It... it started out
as nothing.

1014
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,925
I would come in late
from play rehearsal exhausted,

1015
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:57,327
And she'd talk me
through the homework.

1016
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:02,332
But it kept progressing.

1017
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,568
I had no time to study.

1018
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:06,170
I was class president.

1019
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:08,238
I was captain
of the volleyball team.

1020
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:12,576
I was lead in the fall play,
and the more I took on,

1021
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,511
The more I needed her.

1022
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,447
And I let her do it for me.

1023
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:24,221
And before I knew it,
it just...

1024
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:26,923
I know.

1025
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:29,626
Jane...

1026
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,597
She did my application.

1027
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,299
She got me in.

1028
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,203
But look what it got me.

1029
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:40,670
This.

1030
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:43,273
A career.

1031
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:47,111
A standing in the community.

1032

You're not going to do
anything.

Are you?

1036
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:07,364
You're afraid
she'll expose you.

1037

1038

What? Are you serious?

1043
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,608
If you don't play
by her rules,

1044

She will out you
as a cheater.

1045
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,281
You'll be kicked
out of Edgington.

1046
01:06:57,314 --> 01:06:59,683

What, so I'm just
supposed to play along?

1050
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,736
Yes.

1051
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,607
And then you can go off
to Cornell and start over

1052
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,809
And forget
any of this ever happened.

1053

01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:26,403
* Because I lose

1064
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:33,210
* Time after time,
so I use... *

1065
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,737
I'm sorry.

1066
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,872
I... I just had to see you.

1067
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,476
I let myself in.
I fell asleep waiting for you.

1068
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,878
I... I hope you don't mind.

1069
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,581
Of course not.

1070
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:47,451
Are you all right?

1071
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,319
I don't like being alone.

1072
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:59,929
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1073
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:03,467
I'm so sorry
for what Bobby did to you.

1074
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,734
I should have
seen it coming.

1075
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,870
He was always
talking about you.

1076
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:09,005
I just can't believe
he did what he did.

1077
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,407
I'll be fine.

1078
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,675
Don't you worry about me.

1079
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,643
And Danni.

1080
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:17,581
She was just
so jealous of me...

1081
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,883
Of you and me.

1082
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,586
At times, we don't want
to see the signs of illness

1083
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:24,521
In the people we love.

1084
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,858
I realize now just what
you were trying to do for me.

1085
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:32,996
I understand now the way
things work in the real world.

1086
01:10:35,299 --> 01:10:38,702
I didn't get that before,
but I get that now.

1087
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,537
- I'm just here to help.
- I know.

1088
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,474
Just like you helped
my mother.

1089
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:45,775
She told you?

1090
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,847
I saw something
in your mother.

1091
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,383
I knew it
from the moment we met.

1092
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,419
She had something.

1093
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,687
Everyone was drawn to her.

1094
01:10:57,721 --> 01:10:59,523
She had the light.

1095
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:03,360
And you were
such good friends.

1096
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:05,795
We were.
We were, indeed.

1097
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,397
And you did so much

1098
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:09,866
To help her to get her
where she is today.

1099
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:14,904
I'm sorry you drifted apart.

1100
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:18,775
It was inevitable,
but I'm happy for your mother,

1101
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:21,711
And I'm happy I could
help her in some small way.

1102
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,517
You have the gift, Bridgette.

1103
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:29,486
I saw it in you

1104
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:32,889
The very same way
as I saw it in your mother.

1105
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:35,925
Everyone is born
with a purpose.

1106
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:40,697
I recognized at a very early age
that I don't have that light,

1107
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,533
That spark that you
and your mother have.

1108
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,435
But what I do have

1109
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:48,605
Is the ability to recognize
those lights in others

1110
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:51,941
And help those light bearers
achieve their destinies.

1111
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:57,013
You really think I'm a light
bearer, Miss Cunningham?

1112
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,015
Jane.

1113
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:02,652
Oh, I know so.
It's my gift, remember?

1114
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:06,656
Your light is bright, my dear.

1115
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,392
I have so much to learn.

1116
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:11,361
Teach me.

1117
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:14,664
Help me.

1118
01:12:24,408 --> 01:12:34,350
[***]

1119
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,629
Okay. Just make this
a little bit more clear.

1120
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:46,930
Okay.

1121
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,767
[Phone vibrates]

1122
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,070
Sorry. I don't recognize
this number. I better get it.

1123
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:55,872
Hello?

1124
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:57,106
Yes, it is.

1125
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:03,913
Are you serious?

1126
01:13:03,947 --> 01:13:06,082
Oh my God!
Yes, th... thank you.

1127
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,051
Thank you so much!

1128
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:11,655
I'm a finalist for Eurotour!

1129
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:15,592
Bridgette, that's amazing!
Congratulations!

1130
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,861
Tryouts are this weekend,
upstate.

1131
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:21,698
Oh, it's so exciting!

1132
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,933
I have a great idea.

1133
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,002
How about you come up
with me?

1134
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:27,604
- To the trials?
- Yes.

1135
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,639
We'll have so much fun
on the trip,

1136
01:13:29,673 --> 01:13:31,908
And maybe on the way back,
we can stop in New York City,

1137
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:34,444
Catch a show,
see a couple of museums.

1138
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:38,748
I don't know.
Just the two of us?

1139
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:41,751
Yeah! A weekender.
We'll have a blast!

1140
01:13:43,687 --> 01:13:45,088
Okay!

1141
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:49,092
[Cheers]

1142
01:14:17,754 --> 01:14:18,955
All set?

1143
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:21,725
Where's your stuff?

1144
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:25,995
Bridgette, is something wrong?

1145
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:29,899
You're one crazy bitch!

1146
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,570
I beg your pardon?

1147
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,139
Come on. Let's go!

1148
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:39,075
You're not going anywhere.

1149
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:40,644
But what about Eurotour?

1150
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:42,011
Jane, stop!

1151
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:46,182
I've had enough of you.

1152
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,051
My mother
has had enough of you.

1153
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:51,988
All those girls you've ruined
have had enough of you!

1154
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:55,291
You're evil,

1155
01:14:55,324 --> 01:15:00,163
And you're going away
for a long, long time.

1156
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,799
Bridgette...

1157
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,835
Don't do this.

1158
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:08,738
- You need me.
- I don't need you!

1159
01:15:08,772 --> 01:15:10,740
All that stuff about
you recognizing light

1160
01:15:10,774 --> 01:15:13,610
And helping others
is just your sick way

1161
01:15:13,643 --> 01:15:17,213
Of justifying your lonely
and obsessive existence.

1162
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:21,117
I don't need you.

1163
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,852
I have never needed you.

1164
01:15:22,886 --> 01:15:25,221
No one has ever needed you.

1165
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,023
[Jane]
Bridgette!

1166
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:30,259
Listen to what you're saying.

1167
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:33,897
You could have everything,
and you're throwing it all away.

1168
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,699
I want you to admit yourself

1169
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:38,334
To St. Abigail's
psychiatric ward.

1170
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,804
It's a lockdown
treatment facility.

1171
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,813
I... will expose you...

1172
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,981
For the cheat that you are.

1173
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:54,751
You will never
graduate from here,

1174
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,653
Much less go to Cornell

1175
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:58,988
Or any other reputable
university for that matter.

1176
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:02,291
Fine! So be it!

1177
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:05,261
Headmaster York
is right outside these doors.

1178
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,931
Now you come to your senses,
or I go straight out there

1179
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:09,599
And I tell him
all about your cheating

1180
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:10,934
And your mother's as well.

1181
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:13,837
Jane,
I'm giving you a chance.

1182
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:17,707
I won't go to the FBI
if you'll just comply.

1183
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:21,344
FBI?

1184
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:23,212
I'm afraid
giving prescription drugs

1185
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:26,850
To a minor is a felony.

1186
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:29,886
Oh, and those tapes
of Bobby and I having sex?

1187
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:35,224
Hmm, I think the FBI frowns
upon child pornography.

1188
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:38,027
[Fighting sounds]

1189
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,999
[Screams]

1190
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,873
[Cheers]

1191
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,018
Say it!

1192
01:17:02,886 --> 01:17:04,053
Say you'll go!

1193
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:06,022
Say you'll go,
or I'm going to the FBI.

1194
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:07,757
- Okay. Let me up!
- You'll go?

1195
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:11,227
- Yes.
- You'll go immediately.

1196
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,896
Yes.

1197
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:15,031
[Heavy breathing]

1198
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,116
[Screams]

1199
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:39,355
I dare you.

1200
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:43,192
You think
you could blackmail me?

1201
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:44,728
Huh?

1202
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:51,768
[Scream]

1203
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,174
[Heavy breathing]

1204
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,912
Are you all right?

1205
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:05,849
Oh, my baby! My baby!

1206
01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:20,196
Miss Berwitt,
are you all right?

1207
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,367
Why would you do
all that alone?

1208
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,069
That was reckless.

1209
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:28,171
Indeed!
You could have been killed.

1210
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,339
That woman is very dangerous.

1211
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:32,041
Now you say so.

1212
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:34,310
You should have never let
Jane Cunningham come back,

1213
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:36,345
And you know it.

1214
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:40,716
Yes, well, it's over now,
thanks to you.

1215
01:18:41,885 --> 01:18:43,386
Hold on, Headmaster.

1216
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:48,491
I know what you did.

1217
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:50,126
I know you played a part

1218
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,262
In Jane Cunningham
coming back to Edgington,

1219
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:57,233
And I know you were in cahoots
with Candace on the cover-up.

1220
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:03,873
But we're going to put
all of that behind us right now.

1221
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,942
Here's how it's gonna go.

1222
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:07,944
Mom, effective immediately,

1223
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:09,813
You're going to
turn in your resignation

1224
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:12,115
As chairman
of the Edgington board.

1225
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:13,783
Agreed?

1226
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:16,986
Agreed.

1227
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,922
[Bridgette]
And Headmaster York,

1228
01:19:18,955 --> 01:19:21,390
You are going to make
Edgington history

1229
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:24,060
And grant me
a second chance...

1230
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:28,031
A repeat of my senior year,
as well as reinstate

1231
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:30,399
My position
as the lacrosse captain,

1232
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:34,003
Once the very able
current captain

1233
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:36,039
Completes the season.

1234
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:41,010
In exchange, I will maintain
a 3.5 or above GPA

1235
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:45,548
Throughout the year,
fairly and squarely.

1236
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:47,350
No cheating.

1237
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:50,086
Agreed?

1238
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:56,559
Agreed.

1239
01:19:59,996 --> 01:20:02,098
[Swan honk]

1240
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,506
[Candace] You're so brave.

1241
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,876
If I had half your courage
when I was your age.

1242
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:16,980
Hey, no more looking back,
Mom, only moving forward.

1243
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:21,250
You did the right thing...

1244
01:20:21,284 --> 01:20:23,086
Giving up your position
on the board

1245
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:25,821
And coming clean
with cheating in school.

1246
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:30,126
I'm really proud of you,

1247
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:34,030
And I'm really sorry it had
such an impact on your campaign.

1248
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:35,531
I think you would have been

1249
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:38,167
The best city councilman
probably ever.

1250
01:20:38,201 --> 01:20:40,503
[Laugh]

1251
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,009
But I'm not sorry
it happened.

1252
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:49,612
Things are better now.

1253
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:52,248
Such a weight lifted.

1254
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:54,383
I don't know
what I was so afraid of.

1255
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:59,122
I haven't been this relaxed
in 25 years.

1256
01:20:59,155 --> 01:21:02,291
Well, a Berwitt
is never down for long.

1257
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:04,627
What's next,
another campaign?

1258
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,429
Another board?

1259
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:08,364
President?
[laugh]

1260
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:11,467
I know exactly what
I'm going to be doing.

1261
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,369
I'm going to be enjoying you

1262
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,204
For the last few weeks
that you're here

1263
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:16,906
Before you go off to college

1264
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:19,142
Because there's nothing
more important to me.

1265
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:25,448
The rest will all
fall into place.

1266
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:41,464
[***]

1267
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:45,668
[Jane] Love her,
love her, love her.

1268
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:51,240
If she favors you,

1269
01:21:51,274 --> 01:21:54,377
Love her.

1270
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:57,513
If she wounds you,

1271
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:01,150
Love her.

1272
01:22:01,184 --> 01:22:03,586
If she tears your heart
to pieces

1273
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:06,322
And as it gets older
and stronger,

1274
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:09,192
It will tear deeper.

1275
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:13,462
Love her, love her.

1276
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:15,431
Love her.

1277
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:21,070
Everybody needs
a little help sometimes.

1278
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:23,039
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1279
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,410
You have a bright future
ahead of you.

1280
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,078
Trust me.

1281
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:33,082
Your light is very bright,
my dear.

1282
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:40,256
[***]
