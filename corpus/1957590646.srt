00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,674
(orchestral tuning)

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:07,591
(glass shattering)

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,300
(light chime music)

4
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:35,937
(chime tones)

00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:42,551
(ethereal instrumental music)

6
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:47,160
(upbeat pop music)

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,133
♫ I want a man hotter
than a hot frying pan

8
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:56,203
♫ Searing up a sizzlin' steak

9
00:00:56,203 --> 00:01:00,370
♫ I'll be burnin' on low
on your back burner baby

10
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,314
♫ Taking long as it will it take

11
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,064
♫ While I simmer

12
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:13,654
♫ Bring me to a second boil

13
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:17,634
♫ I love your secret recipe

14
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:20,717
♫ You make me simmer

15
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,505
♫ With a little more oil

16
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:30,110
♫ Teach me something culinary

17
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,277
♫ I have wined and dined in
all the fine places, baby

18
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:38,589
♫ Five-star restaurants

19
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:43,539
♫ Eating out has always
been my favorite thing

20
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:47,977
♫ And you know just what this lady wants

21
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:51,060
♫ Come on and simmer

22
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,720
♫ Bless your shish kebab

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,821
♫ Your pressure cooker makes my day

24
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,904
♫ Come on and simmer

25
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:09,141
♫ Stay on the job

26
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,893
♫ I need a little taste of your saute

27
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:16,976
♫ Come on and simmer

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,237
♫ How you fricassee

29
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:26,393
♫ You always leave me wantin' more

30
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:29,476
♫ Come on and simmer

31
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,638
♫ Now give it to me

32
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:39,198
♫ You always leave me wantin' more

33
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:43,499
♫ You always leave me wantin' more

34
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,666
♫ You always leave me wantin' more

35
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:51,575
(cheering and clapping)

36
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:54,017
(drumhit)

37
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:55,264
(light music)

38
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:58,431
- I have known these
ladies for five years,

39
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:00,713
and I don't think one day has gone by

40
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,630
without Rebecca saying
something about Susan.

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,707
(chuckling)

42
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,211
- That's true.

43
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,628
- That's good, and do
you Susan take Rebecca

44
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:12,166
(chuckling)

45
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,850
to honor, and respect, and enjoy?

46
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,562
By the power vested in me,

47
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:20,497
by the state of California,

48
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:22,455
I now pronounce you

49
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:23,288
- Well?

50
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,814
- Married.

51
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:26,990
(chuckles)

52
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,490
(light music)

53
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,025
- Aww.

54
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:36,275
(applause)

55
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:44,113
- Here's to a toast, yeah.
- A toast, a toast!

56
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:45,393
- [Woman] I have a toast.

57
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,931
- Aww.

58
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:47,764
- To

59
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,014
Rebecca and

60
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:51,811
what's-her-name Susan.

61
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,580
(laughing)

62
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,747
Rebecca was my first love,

63
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,566
so this is my farewell toast.

64
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,459
I bid you farewell.

65
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,547
Don't forget I taught
her everything she knows.

66
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,137
(laughing)
- [Woman] Ooh!

67
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,415
- [Susan] I thank you.

68
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,248
- [Ex] Best of luck, Becca, Susan.

69
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:16,210
And, uh, you know, we'll
see six months from now.

70
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,460
- I so excited.

71
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,474
(clink)

72
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:23,165
- That's nice.

73
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:24,676
- See you later, buddy.

74
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,009
- Careful.
- Ooh!

75
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:27,942
- Nice one.

76
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:29,175
(laughing)

77
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,121
Do you know how much that stuff costs?

78
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,595
(laughing)

79
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:34,315
- I found out Susan's pregnant,

80
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,343
and, um, they're gonna
name the godparent tonight.

81
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,630
I think it's gonna be me.

82
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,957
- Yeah, I agree,

83
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:43,789
if they want the baby to have
fashion advice from someone.

84
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:44,622
- To love.

85
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:45,705
- To love.
- To love.

86
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:48,339
- Cheers, cheers.
- Cheers.

87
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,589
- [Man] Cheers.

88
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:57,052
- You guys, Susan and
I would just like to,

89
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:00,920
(sighs) my wife (laughs).

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,753
- Finally.

91
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:06,658
- We would just like to thank
you guys for being here.

92
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,292
I mean, this is what it's all about.

93
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,231
I mean, you're our family.

94
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:12,451
- [Susan] Also, just being here on

95
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,620
what was a moment's notice.

96
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,818
- Because of Proposition
8 looming over our heads,

97
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,418
and The Family just being
all up in our business.

98
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,585
- And, uh, and even though
it probably won't pass,

99
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,530
we just thought that we should do it.

100
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,543
- Just in case.
- Just in case.

101
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,114
- So, thank you.
- Thank you.

102
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:37,697
- And also, to our amazing Paul

103
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,851
who pretty much orchestrated

104
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:42,635
this whole evening.
- Cheers.

105
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,229
(cheering and clapping)
- So, thank you.

106
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,403
He insisted, and took care
of every little detail.

107
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:48,548
You know Paul.

108
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,513
- [All] To Paul.

109
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:53,004
- And, uh, Paul this is for you from us.

110
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,974
(interested murmurs)

111
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:57,307
(chuckling)

112
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,508
- Oh.

113
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:01,758
- [Woman] Open it, open it.

114
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,204
- Wow, um, okay.

115
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:13,293
Oh, what the heck.
(laughing)

116
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:20,532
Oh my god.

117
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:23,263
Ladies and ladies.

118
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,619
(laughing)

119
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,202
I've just been asked to be this

120
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:34,910
glorious couple's first child's godparent.

121
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,160
(clapping)

122
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,548
- Paul is gonna make the
worst godparent ever.

123
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:44,014
- Yes, he's not going
to be very good at all.

124
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,823
(clapping)

125
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,416
- [Woman] It was a great space already,

126
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,499
we just needed to clean out a little.

127
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:54,678
- You spilled.

128
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:56,414
- [Woman] I'm good, I'm drinking some.

129
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:57,366
- Oops.

130
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,449
- You know, Paul, I think

131
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,747
you are going to make
the best godparent ever.

132
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,472
Congratulations.

133
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:08,009
- Thank you.

134
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,033
- Ladies are the most faithful,

135
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,699
ladies and seahorses
are the most faithful.

136
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,866
(upbeat pop music)
(party chatter)

137
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,997
- Do you know that guy?

138
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:28,336
(soft chattering)

139
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:31,182
- Don't look.
- Don't look.

140
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:33,880
(laughing)
(soft chattering)

141
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,463
- Terry, you need to calm down.

142
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:39,514
Have some fun.

143
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:40,797
Are you drinking?

144
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:42,029
Drink more.

145
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,279
- Oh for god's sakes, just ask him out.

146
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:49,142
(clears throat)

147
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:50,374
What are you taking now?

148
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:51,207
Paul.

149
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:57,598
- Terry thought he was
gonna be named a godparent.

150
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,349
- Oh no, you are kidding me.

151
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,840
I told,

152
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,574
I told Susan not to tell
anybody, especially Terry,

153
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:07,359
'cause he can't keep a secret.

154
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,276
Is he hurt?

155
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:14,494
- I beat Terry.
(laughing)

156
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,898
- You're terrible.

157
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:18,981
Here, it's an early birthday present.

158
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:27,901
(gasping)

159
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:28,734
Yeah!

160
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:29,567
- Rebecca.

161
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:33,939
Thank you.

162
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,391
- Her 10th farewell performance.

163
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,814
- Yeah, you know what,
you should ask Jim to go.

164
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,803
I know he's a complete
Miss Piggy B freak, too.

165
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:47,368
I think you guys would really hit it off.

166
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:49,357
You should ask him.

167
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:53,024
Paul, grow some big
ones and go ask him out.

168
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,314
- You know I can't be in
a relationship right now.

169
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:59,981
My work takes up all of my time,

170
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,227
and keeping up with this house,

171
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:04,958
and I'm way too set in my ways,

172
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,791
and I think I'm allergic to Lycra.

173
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:13,383
- Well, there's a pussy on
this couch, and it ain't me.

174
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:17,550
(laid-back music)
(soft chattering)

175
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:21,035
- [Man] Great speech.

176
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:21,868
(gasping)

177
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,288
- [Paul] Oh no, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

178
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:25,221
- [Woman] Don't worry.

179
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:26,054
- [Waitor] Here you go.

180
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:27,881
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yes, no problem.

181
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,827
You dropped that, yes.

182
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:32,507
(laughing)

183
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,602
- At least it wasn't red wine.

184
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:36,608
- I don't allow red wine in the house.

185
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:37,441
It stains.

186
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:42,760
- Well, I just love, love, love your home.

187
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,081
It kind of reminds me of Tomorrow Land.

188
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:48,592
- That's the best compliment ever.

189
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,380
I loved your ceremony.

190
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,316
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

191
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:56,723
So, Paul, Rebecca tells me you haven't

192
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:59,306
had a relationship since high school.

193
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:02,189
How does that make you feel?

194
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:03,022
- Um.

195
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:05,486
Just fine.

196
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:11,664
- Well, it was great to
finally meet you, Paul.

197
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,612
Here's my card.

198
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,202
Call me anytime.

199
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:25,284
Rebecca put me up to this (chuckles).

200
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,117
- Thank you.

201
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,700
(laid-back rhythmic music)

202
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,464
(gasping)

203
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:54,296
(paper rustles)

204
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,393
I have tickets.

205
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:58,812
- Oh!

206
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:02,401
Wow, um, that's great.

207
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:05,151
I'm actually producing the event.

208
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:14,028
Well, I just wanted to come
by and say hi before I left.

209
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:21,342
You know, Rebecca says so
much great things about you.

210
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:22,481
She really loves you,

211
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,849
which means you must not be
that bad, because she's great.

212
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:30,479
Well, I guess, I guess
I'll see you around.

213
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,479
Great place.

214
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,890
- Yeah, the um.

215
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,979
(laughing)

216
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:43,479
- He didn't hear you say that.

217
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,544
- Paul.

218
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:46,752
- Be quiet.

219
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,331
(bright piano music)

220
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:51,674
- [Peggy B] And when I was 36 years old,

221
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:53,924
I thought my life was over.

222
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,067
Life hadn't gone the way that I planned

223
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,847
and I thought I was through.

224
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:04,862
After years of trying to
make something of myself,

225
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:06,195
I had to wonder,

226
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:08,654
is that it?

227
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:11,923
Is that all I get?

228
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,377
♫ Is that it

229
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,838
♫ Is that all I get

230
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,064
♫ I want more

231
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:30,734
♫ More than before

232
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:34,311
♫ If that's it

233
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:36,199
♫ If that's all I get

234
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,824
- So what now, Margo?

235
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,308
(phone ringing)

236
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,056
- [Susan] Paul?

237
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,973
Paul, it's your father.

238
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:45,085
- Hmm?

239
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,711
- [Susan] It's your father.

240
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:56,968
- Dad?

241
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,498
- Have you heard from your mother?

242
00:12:58,498 --> 00:12:59,331
- What?

243
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:01,988
- Your Mom.

244
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:04,708
I mean, the car could break
down, she could get lost,

245
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,317
she could end up in a ditch
on the side of the road.

246
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,490
I mean, the woman has the worst

247
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,458
sense of direction of anybody I know,

248
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,172
even after I got her that
expensive GPS navigation system

249
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,651
in that overpriced car of hers.

250
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,944
I mean, she barely knows
- Dad, Dad.

251
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:19,111
- How to turn it on.
- Dad.

252
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,207
You're scaring me.

253
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:24,374
- I'm sorry, I'm, I'm sure she's fine.

254
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:27,846
She left today

255
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:30,845
to, to drive out to see you.

256
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:31,727
Just don't worry about her.

257
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,471
I'm sure she's fine.

258
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:36,091
How was Rebecca and Susan's wedding?

259
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:38,197
(Paul sighs)

260
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:40,449
- [Paul] It was perfect.

261
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:42,049
- Yeah?

262
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:42,882
Good.

263
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,193
Paul, um,

264
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:52,920
you ever think that maybe
you might wanna get married?

265
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,675
- Well, I don't know, Dad.

266
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,342
Mom doesn't exactly approve, and

267
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:01,216
I mean.

268
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,917
(scoffs)

269
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:08,127
- Well, I just want you to
know that I'd support you, son,

270
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,836
with all my heart,

271
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:12,816
and I'm sure your mother does, too.

272
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,631
So, it's late, I'm gonna let you go,

273
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:19,588
but, um, but, listen, don't
tell your mother I called, okay?

274
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:22,998
I know she wants to surprise
you herself in person.

275
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:24,325
- Okay, Dad.

276
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:25,742
- Well, just, um,

277
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,680
I love you Paulie.

278
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,763
- I love you.

279
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:32,612
- Goodnight, son.

280
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,200
- I can't believe it.

281
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:50,637
My dad just said that my
mom is coming to visit me,

282
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,031
and that he and my mother support me

283
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:54,531
if I ever want to get married.

284
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,860
- Wow.

285
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,317
- This is really a big deal.

286
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,150
- Cool.

287
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:02,870
- Wow.

288
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:09,023
(upbeat instrumental music)
(clapping)

289
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,654
- Milly here runs her own
very successful company

290
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:18,786
that deals with multimillion dollar deals,

291
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,369
but

292
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,478
she is a virgin.

293
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:26,418
She has only had one
relationship in high school,

294
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,501
and she is very

295
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:29,959
very

296
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:30,792
unhappy.

297
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:36,612
- (sobbing) Nobody loves me.

298
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:42,984
- You're obviously a huge mess.

299
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,634
Have you ever thought
about any kind of therapy?

300
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:47,974
- No.

301
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:51,582
- What is your professional
opinion of this Dr. Christina?

302
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:52,529
(clapping)

303
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,651
- I think Milly's a complete mess.

304
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:57,967
Most likely needs a long-time
commitment to my help.

305
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,624
Possibly everyday for
the rest of her life.

306
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:03,034
I think Milly should call
the number on the screen.

307
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:05,710
Otherwise, she might as well.

308
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,934
(laughing)
Just to say hi.

309
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:09,127
- [Man On TV] Come to the Happy Garden.

310
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:11,924
Happy Garden in Long Beach.

311
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:12,955
This week's special,
(phone rings)

312
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:14,445
Kung Pao chicken.

313
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,794
It's yummy, try it.
(beeping)

314
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,346
- Dr. Christina (clears throat),

315
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,263
this is Paul Roll here.

316
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:27,589
I need to make an appointment
with you real soon,

317
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,109
I don't,

318
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:32,894
I don't want to be in therapy
for the rest of my life,

319
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:35,727
so can you call me back,

320
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:36,560
please?

321
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:39,511
Thank you.

322
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,063
Please, please.

323
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,813
- Is he your new American boyfriend?

324
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,313
- Don't be stupid.

325
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:52,850
He sounded gay.

326
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,344
(TV chatter in foreign language)

327
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:57,427
(crying)

328
00:16:58,855 --> 00:16:59,918
(phone rings)

329
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,593
- [Answering Machine] Hello,
please leave a message

330
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:03,189
after the tone. (beeps)

331
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,448
- [Paul] Dr. Christina, I
don't wanna die alone...

332
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:10,615
- He sounded gay.
(crying on answering machine)

333
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:16,129
(TV chatter in foreign language)

334
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,486
(snoring)

335
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:25,664
Stupid.
- Stupid.

336
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:34,613
(thunder rumbles)
(rain falling)

337
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:42,431
- Oh for god sakes, come on!

338
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:47,097
(crying)

339
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,202
Oh please!

340
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,225
(thunder rumbles)

341
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:55,058
Okay.

342
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:00,921
Where am I?

343
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:03,980
- [GPS] Please relocate.

344
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,380
- Where am I?
- [GPS] Please relocate.

345
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,038
(sobbing)

346
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,088
(thunder rumbles)
(rain falling)

347
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,255
(gasping)

348
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:26,323
(knocking)

349
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,917
- Need some help, honey?

350
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,500
(rain falling)

351
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,173
(knocking)

352
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,290
(glass shatters)

353
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,540
(knocking)

354
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:53,470
- Where have you been?

355
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,492
I've been calling you!

356
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:55,958
Oh my god, you look like shit.

357
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,422
(door thuds)

358
00:18:58,422 --> 00:18:59,628
- [Paul] What are you doing?

359
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:00,559
- We're getting you dressed.

360
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,671
We're going to meet the gang for lunch.

361
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:05,884
Oh my god, you have nothing to wear.

362
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:07,352
We've gotta do something about this.

363
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,398
- What's wrong with my clothes?

364
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,338
- Here, take this, ugh.

365
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:12,255
That'll do.

366
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,670
And hurry up.

367
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,093
(ethereal instrumental music)

368
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:22,117
- [Rebecca] All you have to do, a little.

369
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:24,435
- [Terry] Miss Drama Queen over there.

370
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:27,393
- [Rebecca] All you have to
do is focus on what you want,

371
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:28,226
right?

372
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:32,393
(chattering and laughter)
(sad contemplative music)

373
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:45,884
- [Rachel] Listen, all you
have to do, a little...

374
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,842
- Miss Drama queen over here.

375

377
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:56,716
- [Sara] The point is, there
are just some people...

378
00:19:56,716 --> 00:20:00,883
(chattering)
(contemplative music)

379

(gasps)

380
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:04,465
- I want to get married.

381
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,314
- Good!
- Okay!

382
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:06,431
This is wonderful!
- No, okay.

383
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,863
- [Terry] Not okay.

384
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:08,979
- Yes, it is okay.

385
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,354
Okay, at least you're starting to know

386
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,407
what it is you want, right?

387
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:13,605
I think it's great.

388
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,582
I mean, you're gonna have
to hurry because, you know,

389
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:17,918
the latest polls show that
Proposition 8 is going to pass.

390
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:20,942
- How can this happen in this day and age?

391
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:23,797
- Terry, you and Paul live in
your perfect little bubble,

392
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,659
but the truth is there are some people

393
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,663
who just don't want us here.

394
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,984
And they're not gonna do
anything to make it easy.

395
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,631
- Yes, like Wisconsin.

396
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,503
- Better hurry up then.

397
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:35,916
- Guys, listen, in reality
he's not gonna be able

398
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,145
to get married in the next

399
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,540
couple of days.
- Listen,

400
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,356
everybody has their own process, right?

401
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:43,109
Especially Paul.
- Please stop with this.

402
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:44,788
Don't encourage this crazy fool

403
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,109
anymore than he's already crazy.

404
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:48,500
- All I know is that when I finally let go

405
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,496
of the idea of what was
supposed to make me happy...

406
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:52,374
- Don't listen to her, okay?

407
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:54,041
- I found happiness.

408
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:56,921
- Where did you buy your vanilla candles?

409
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:00,888
- Okay, look, I'm trying
to tell a story here, okay.

410
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,799
You know, sometimes if you,

411
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,497
if you hang onto something so tight,

412
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,767
I don't know, you just, it could end up

413
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,725
slipping right through
your fingers, you know.

414
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:12,338
- Hey.

415
00:22:12,338 --> 00:22:13,338
Oh hey, Jim!

416
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,373
- We're late.

417
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:17,310
- [Jim] Yeah, are you
guys coming, or what?

418
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,476
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

419
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,583
- You guys, we're organizing a big rally.

420
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,380
Sorry, we gotta go.
(chuckling)

421
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,828
- [Rebecca] You guys I'm so sorry.

422
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:27,687
I'm so sorry.
(soft chattering)

423
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,803
Let's go.
- He'll be fine.

424
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:32,498
(soft chattering)
Oh, it's okay.

425
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:33,665
- Don't leave.

426
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:36,943
Oh, he's handsome.

427
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:40,737
- Who do you think that gorgeous man was?

428
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:44,112
- I don't know, I think
maybe it was Jim's boyfriend.

429
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,879
- Then why did Rebecca try to set us up?

430
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:48,456
- Maybe she didn't know, I don't know.

431
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:51,095
That's what it looked like to me.

432
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:52,945
Oh, did your heart break?

433
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:55,577
- Forget him!
(sharp smacking)

434
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:57,722

It's, it's just really lovely.

and was asking me where you
were at all this kind of stuff,

518
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:54,427
so I just wanted to make
sure that you were okay.

yes, I am, I am on my
way to see you, dear,

521

522
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:02,681
- [Paul] He also told me that
you had something to tell me.

523
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,855
- [Tootsie] Now, where's my purse?

524
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:05,308
- Did you check the back seat?

525
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,141
- No, but.

526
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:07,577

531
00:28:14,981 --> 00:28:18,131
got you worried over nothing.

536
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,895

that you talked to me, okay?

541
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:44,081
I, you know what, I am,
um, taking a little detour.

542
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:47,039

for our anniversary.

- [Paul] But your anniversary

544
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:50,593
isn't for another six months, Mom.

545
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:53,640
- No, well, and I found my purse,

546
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,718
safe and sound.

547
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:57,826
- Um, Mom, I'm gonna have to go.

548
00:28:57,826 --> 00:28:59,232
- Paul?

549
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:01,399
- Love you, miss you, bye.

550
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:04,100
- For heaven sakes.

551
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:09,990
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, sir!

552
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,015
Sir, oh!
(clattering)

553
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:15,354
Do you know where I can
get some nice breakfast?

554
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,441
Oh, god, I guess he didn't hear me.

555
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:19,886
(clattering)

556
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:21,724
(banjo strumming)

557
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:22,557
Oh, god.

558
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,258
Oh.

559
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:26,522
- She dropped somethin'.

560
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:27,480
- I think she did.

561
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,313
I think it's kind of a flat thing.

562
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,564
- What is going on?

563
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:37,284
Oh.

564
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:50,219
- Oh, come on!

565
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:51,052
Open it!

566
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:56,464
Look!

567
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:59,881
It's so you can finally have a boyfriend.

568
00:30:06,998 --> 00:30:09,581
- [Doll] I want to get married.

569
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,541
I want to get married.

570
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,706
I want to get married.

571
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:17,206
- What am I doing?

572
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:23,039
- [Doll] You're the most
beautiful man in the world.

573
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,872
(soft chattering)

574
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:31,255
(whistling)
(cheering)

575
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:33,588
(chuckling)

576
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,387
- You go girl.

577
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:36,557
What's up, lady?

578
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:38,140
Ah, I need a mommy.

579
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:41,229
- [Man] Put it all on black.

580
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:44,062
(soft chattering)

581
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,046
- Ben Crawford, Jordan Stone
are with Miss Deborah Anderson.

582
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:52,988
Jonathan Tate is the big daddy
behind the whole ball of wax.

583
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:55,564
He's a billionaire that's B, not M.

584
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,795
- This is totally in
your corner now, okay?

585
00:30:57,795 --> 00:30:59,196
Besides the new logo,
Tess and I came up with

586
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:00,737
a mockup commercial with all their new

587
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:02,639
sickening sweet specifications.

588
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,052
You got this now, okay?

589
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:04,885
- Yes.
- Well, if they have

590
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:06,652
that much money, then
we can handle anything.

591
00:31:06,652 --> 00:31:07,538
- Let's take that money.

592
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:09,034
- We got this.
(chuckling)

593
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:09,867
Ow.

594
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,575
- Time is money, Mr. Roll.

595
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:20,159
- Yes, I totally agree, Miss Anderson,

596
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,721
and that is why we here
at Roll Advertising

597
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:27,157
have painstakingly created
a mockup commercial

598
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:30,240
that can be run all over the country.

599
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,827
(uplifting inspiring music)

600
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,875
- The way it should be.

601
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:08,605
I like it.

602
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:13,226
But, I need you to tell
me why I should hand over

603
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:17,019
a five million dollar
contract to Roll Advertising.

604
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,076
- By the time that I was 21 years of age,

605
00:32:19,076 --> 00:32:20,700
I was in charge of...

606
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,380
- I am well aware of your
background, Mr. Roll,

607
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,009
otherwise I wouldn't be sittin' here.

608
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,426
- Yes, of course.

609
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:33,153
Roll Advertising is a boutique agency.

610
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:37,716
Now, we take on only clients
we feel we can represent

611
00:32:37,716 --> 00:32:40,270
with the fullest confidence.

612
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,845
The bottom line is

613
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:45,177
your company does not
get lost in the shuffle

614
00:32:45,177 --> 00:32:46,962
like it would with a large firm.

615
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:50,597
Now, I know because I used to
work with that kind of firm.

616
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:52,722
It is being handheld by me

617
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:56,076
all the way through its process.

618
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:57,525
We listen to what you want,

619
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:58,897
we deliver on time,

620
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:00,397
within budget, and

621
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,724
we can take on requests
that sometimes seem

622
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,464
a little impossible.

623
00:33:07,464 --> 00:33:09,547
We love a good challenge.

624
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,936
- Call me Deborah.

625
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:16,412
- We were a little concerned
with our first impression

626
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,518
of Mr...

627
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:19,241
- Let's just say that we weren't sure

628
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:21,825
that you could grasp our vision,

629
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:24,599
but we see that now that
we've met you, Paul,

630
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,025
that you do understand us.

631
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:30,844
This ad campaign is backed
by a very wealthy gentleman,

632
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,075
and it has a very strong agenda.

633
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,825
- Yes, Jonathan Tate.

634
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,249
- I think you are the
perfect man for the job.

635
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:43,290
We'll be in touch, Paul.

636
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,123
We need somethin' done ASA

637
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:46,956
P.

638
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:56,918
(balls clack)
(twangy country music)

639
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:10,075
(slot machine beeps)

640
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:11,701
(coins clank)

641
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,618
- You all right, honey?

642
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:19,172
- Yes, I just, uh, need
to sit for a minute.

643
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:21,814
I just had the, uh, lovely buffet.

644
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:24,780
- Sometimes it has that effect on people.

645
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,159
(slot machine beeps)

646
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,126
- I don't suppose you would
know where I could purchase

647
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:31,209
a cell phone?

648
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:37,467
- What's with all the pay
phones disappearing everywhere?

649
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,967
(coins clank)

650
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:43,446
Maybe the gift shop, sweetie.

651
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:45,574
I don't have one.

652
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:49,035
Personally, I prefer to
be not that easy to find.

653
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:52,723
(slot machine beeps)

654
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,498
- Can I get you something?

655
00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:57,959
- Oh, you know you can
get me something, Lucy.

656
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:02,330
I'll have my usual, and why
don't you give my friend here

657
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,497
something for her stomach.

658
00:35:06,836 --> 00:35:08,419
She had the buffet.

659
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:12,815
(gong rings)

660
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:14,256
(shamisen playing)

661
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:16,056
- [Terry] Why are we eating here?

662
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:17,848
- [Paul] I just had this
craving for kung pao chicken

663
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:18,857
for some reason.

664
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:20,052
- At the Happy Garden?

665
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:21,304
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:23,372
- Well, time is money, Mr. Roll.

667
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,805
(chuckles) She's quite a piece of work.

668
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:27,055
You do realize who this
people are, don't you?

669
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:28,194
- Yep, they're clients.

670
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:29,390
- Well, what if they want us to do yes

671
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,754
on the Prop 8 campaign?

672
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,370
- Terry, for all we know
they just want us to do

673
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,319
these sappy little ads, some email blasts,

674
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:37,134
I mean, look, come on,
we live in California,

675
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,102
and it's, it's, it's 2008.

676
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:42,324
Proposition 8 is never going to pass.

677
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:45,330
- Anyway, I almost died
when Rebecca mentioned them

678
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,580
at the wedding.

679
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:49,785
- Look.

680
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:51,286
I told you.

681
00:35:51,286 --> 00:35:53,297
Bonuses for everybody.

682
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:55,297
- I'm already shuffling.

683
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:57,180
I like him.

684
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,869
- Hmm, you can have him.

685
00:35:58,869 --> 00:35:59,702
- Look.

686
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:02,020
- [Doll] I love you.
(chuckles)

687
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,187
- I just can't believe it.

688
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:07,217
What's wrong?

689
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:12,377
This means everything is gonna be fine.

690
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:14,540
We, we can expand the business.

691
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,750
We can hire more people.

692
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,039
This is everything you dreamed of.

693
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,872
- Mm-hmm.

694
00:36:17,872 --> 00:36:19,705
- I've got an idea,
you're gonna love this.

695
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,400
- Oh, I'm going to take
relationship advice

696
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,061
from a guy who thinks that a date

697
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,586
is a guy showing up at
three in the morning

698
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:27,280
wearing nothing but a
jockstrap and holding a dildo?

699
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,335
Mm-mmh.

700
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:29,182
- Egg rolls,

701
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:31,349
kung pao chicken.
- Thanks.

702
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:33,314
- Chow mein.

703
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:36,020
Rice

704
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,855
for two.

705
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:39,772
(shamisen playing)

706
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:47,284
Yum.

707
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,751
- Alright, thank you.

708
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:54,382
- Tea?

709
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:55,312
- I'm good.

710
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:56,145
- Um.

711
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:57,428
- [Waitress] Soda?

712
00:36:57,428 --> 00:36:58,635
- Uh.
- Uh, no, I think that...

713
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:02,027
- Hot sake?
- I'm fine, thank you.

714
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:04,176
- Do you have, um, Sauvignon blanc?

715
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:05,724
I'd like a glass of that, thanks.

716
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,641
(shamisen playing)

717
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,357
Well, you know what,

718
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:25,524
Rebecca's gonna wonder where
we got this money from.

719
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:29,169
And if she finds out we're
working for The Family,

720
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:30,836
she's gonna kill us.

721
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:33,601
- [Paul] Well, she's
never going to find out

722
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,542
unless you tell her.

723
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:38,292
(shamisen music)

724
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:42,399
- What is in this drink?

725
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,149
I feel just fine now.

726
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,609
(giggles)

727
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:52,424
You know, there is something
so wonderfully addictive

728
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:56,057
and hypnotic about putting all this money

729
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:58,908
and then watching all the
little pictures whiz by.

730
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:00,699
- Atta girl.

731
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:03,199
(coins clank)

732
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:07,123
- I wanna thank you for the other night.

733
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,510
(slot machine beeps)

734
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,010
- The other night?

735
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,534
- You were the one who came to my rescue

736
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:15,013
by the side of the road.

737
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:17,346
- Oh, it was nothin', honey.

738
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:26,810
(coins clank)
(chuckling)

739
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,267
- $300!

740
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:32,116
$300, I have never won
anything in my life.

741
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:36,283
All right, I gotta call
Gregory. (chuckles)

742
00:38:38,311 --> 00:38:41,359
But I still need to get a phone.

743
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,556
- You better get a room
while you're at it.

744
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:45,753
You're not drivin' anywhere,

745
00:38:45,753 --> 00:38:47,420
and call your hubby.

746
00:38:48,444 --> 00:38:51,527
(slot machine beeps)

747
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:05,821
- [Tootsie] Hi, this is Tootsie.

748
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,432
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone.

749
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:10,609
I'm probably out shopping or
maybe something more important.

750
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,526
Just leave a message...

751
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:18,284
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

752
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:25,242
Ah-hah.

753
00:39:26,304 --> 00:39:30,385
(slow guitar strumming)

754
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:33,885
(spaghetti western music)

755
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:52,116
What ya got there, little lady?

756
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:56,052
- Hey, what you doin' there
messin' with my baby girl?

757
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:57,223
- I-I'm sorry.

758
00:39:57,223 --> 00:39:58,468
- Oh, come on, honey.

759
00:39:58,468 --> 00:40:00,886
- No, that looks like
my wife's cell phone.

760
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:03,843
Have you seen a woman by herself, um,

761
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:05,707
mid 40s?
- Yep,

762
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:10,419
I think we saw a little car
down the ways broken down.

763
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:12,106
- Could, could you take me there?

764
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:13,877
We, we could take my car.

765
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:15,757
- Yeah, I think we could take you there.

766
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:16,956
I think that'd be real nice.

767
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,027
Don't you think that'd
be real nice, baby girl?

768
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:20,038
- Come on.
- We could take him

769
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:22,100
for a ride, couldn't we?

770
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,933
We could take 'em for a real good ride.

771
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:27,515
Come on, sweetie pie.

772
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:30,598
(train signal chimes)
- Put in the number, press

773
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:31,431
prog.

774
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:36,273
(train whistle blows)

775
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:45,284
Put in number, press Prog.

776
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:49,065
Okay.

777
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:51,482
(horn blows)

778
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,146
- Here, let me do it.
- No, this is it.

779
00:40:57,146 --> 00:40:58,935
- [Gregory] Otherwise
you will be here all day.

780
00:40:58,935 --> 00:40:59,969
- No, it's supposed...

781
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:01,658
- If you want to get
Paulie's number in here,

782
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:03,532
it's very simple, now watch.

783
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:05,892
You go to your memory, open that up,

784
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:09,212
so you're gonna add a new in your menu.

785
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:11,712
(train chugs)

786
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,285
- Well, you lie.

787
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:16,535
Okay, I'm done.

788
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:19,624
(horn beeps)

789
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:20,707
Stupid phone.

790
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:25,014
It won't call anybody,
it won't talk to anybody.

791
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:26,045
I'm done.

792
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:29,540
(sighs) Maybe I could try a new phone.

793
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,464
- [Man On Right] Restaurant down there,

794
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:31,628
they got some good stuff.

795
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:33,709
- Do they have any pickles?
- Are you sure

796
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:35,530
we're in the right place, guys?

797
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,263
- I don't know, we'll have to find out

798
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:39,048
if they got any pickles.

799
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:40,840
(banjo strumming)

800
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,412
Come November, I think
I'm gonna get a job again,

801
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:44,946
and that'll be real good.

802
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:46,251
- I'm gonna get some turkey.

803
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:49,668
- But the road ends, I mean,
there's nothing out here, guys.

804
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:53,212
- [Man] Yep, we're in the right
place, aren't we, baby girl?

805
00:41:53,212 --> 00:41:54,559
- [Woman] We're in the right place.

806
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:56,915
- Why don't you show him what you got?

807
00:41:56,915 --> 00:42:00,172
Yeah, that's real good,
just point it at him.

808
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:01,717
- Ah, okay, okay.

809
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:04,944
- Now, huh, what we need from you.

810
00:42:04,944 --> 00:42:05,792
- Yeah?

811
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,993
- Is we need that there watch.

812
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:09,944
I like that ring.

813
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,342
- I like his pants.

814
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:13,577
- And baby girl likes your pants.

815
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:17,744
(yelling)
(western music)

816
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:24,632
- Damn it!

817
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,860
(slow western music)

818
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,758
(train chugs)

819
00:42:42,362 --> 00:42:44,779
(horn beeps)

820
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,103
(chuckling)

821
00:42:56,945 --> 00:42:59,688
- I gotta call somebody.

822
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:04,282
(railroad crossing bell dings)

823
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,699
(laid back guitar music)

824
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,131
(jazzy instrumental music)

825
00:43:45,761 --> 00:43:48,661
- I just can't believe Rebecca
would do something like that.

826
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:51,034
- I don't like him
anyway, he's one of those.

827
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,375
- One of those what?

828
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,965
- He's one of those humanitarian types

829
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,691
that wants to save the planet.

830
00:43:55,691 --> 00:43:57,452
- What's wrong with that?

831
00:43:57,452 --> 00:44:00,141
(phone rings)

832
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:04,006
Can you, uh, can you get
me the phone, please?

833
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:08,173
(phone rings)
(jazzy instrumental music)

834
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,004
This is Paul.

835
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:13,254
- Hello, honey.

836
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:15,748
- Can you cover yourself up?

837
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:17,331
- She can't see us.

838
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:20,010
- Um, Mom, are you there?

839
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,152
- Yeah, listen, I just wanted
to let you know I'm going to

840
00:44:23,152 --> 00:44:25,465
be a few more.
- Hello?

841
00:44:25,465 --> 00:44:28,969
- I'm, I'm having lunch with
some friends at this very,

842
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,860
very quaint little restaurant.

843
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,346
- Hello, hello?

844
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:33,762
- Paul?

845
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:35,584
Can you hear me?

846
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:37,133
- Hmm.

847
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,133
(gasps)

848
00:44:46,738 --> 00:44:49,571
(soft chattering)

849
00:44:55,408 --> 00:44:56,575
I am so sorry.

850
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:00,546
Do you mind?

851
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:03,009
Honestly, this has never happened before.

852
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:05,746
I'm really, really
sorry, really apologize.

853
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,913
I'll get you some napkins.

854
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:12,474
- Hello?

855
00:45:14,238 --> 00:45:15,903
Hello, hello?

856
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,746
- Come on, now clean him up.

857
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:21,047
- Hello, hello?
- Especially his little bits.

858
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:23,646
(jazzy instrumental music)

859
00:45:23,646 --> 00:45:26,229
(razor buzzes)

860
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:31,024
- Are you sure this is what guys want?

861
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:33,181
I look like a prepubescent boy.

862
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:35,258
- Well, at least something looks young.

863
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:36,341
- Very funny.

864
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,176
What?

865
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:40,989
I'm not wearing any socks
with my loafers, like you.

866
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:45,146
- Yeah, mine are Prada, yours are boring.

867
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:48,110
(fabric rips)

868
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,277
(panting)

869
00:46:00,813 --> 00:46:02,558
- Here ya go, honey.

870
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:05,737
- Thanks, Lucy. (chuckles)

871
00:46:05,737 --> 00:46:09,237
(laid-back country music)

872
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:14,204
I don't mean to pry, but

873
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:18,047
why do you always wear sunglasses?

874
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:19,714
- Long story, honey.

875
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:21,832
Long story.

876
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:26,252
So what's a rich, uptight lady like you

877
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:28,737
doing in a hellhole like this?

878
00:46:28,737 --> 00:46:32,237
(laid-back country music)

879
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:40,566
I have to get up real
close, so I can see you.

880
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:44,066
(laid-back country music)

881
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,191
- Well, what did you, uh, see there?

882
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:53,024
You raised an eyebrow.

883
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:58,602
- So you ran off just
like little Dorothy Gale

884
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:00,570
tryin' to figure out
what's on the other side

885
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:01,820
of the rainbow.

886
00:47:03,024 --> 00:47:05,271
I'd say you got pissed
off with your hubby,

887
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:08,655
and ran off to be with your son.

888
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:11,042
- My fuckface of a husband.

889
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:13,262
- I stand corrected.

890
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,512
Your fuckface of a husband.

891
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,037
- You know, Gregory has
these primitive ideas

892
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:24,565
about having to do everything for me,

893
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:29,086
till one day I realized I
didn't know how to do anything,

894
00:47:29,086 --> 00:47:30,753
balance a checkbook,

895
00:47:31,884 --> 00:47:34,979
program that damn navigational
device he got for me,

896
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:35,812
nothing.

897
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:38,084
And my son,

898
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:41,306
my son is gay.

899
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:45,339
- And you have a little problem with that?

900
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:47,830
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

901
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,061
I, uh, I don't have a
problem with that at all.

902
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:54,985
I am a very, very open-minded,
modern woman, I am.

903
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:55,902
- Bullshit.

904
00:47:58,964 --> 00:48:00,931
That's what you want people to think,

905
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:04,186
but deep down you still
have those old feelings

906
00:48:04,186 --> 00:48:05,396
that were drilled into you

907
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,957
when you were a little Catholic girl.

908
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:11,457
(laid-back country music)

909
00:48:18,624 --> 00:48:20,707
I wish my son wasn't gay.

910
00:48:24,353 --> 00:48:26,393
(sighs)

911
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:27,226
Yeah.

912
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:32,567
I thought I was the most amazing mom,

913
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,675
waving the rainbow flag,

914
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:36,675
hanging out at gay bars,

915
00:48:38,078 --> 00:48:41,282
and then I realized I just
wasn't that comfortable

916
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:42,282
with it all.

917
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:52,881
I was raised in a very
strict, religious home.

918
00:48:57,588 --> 00:49:01,755
You know, this whole
marriage thing is just crazy.

919
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:05,195
When I had Paul,

920
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:09,909
I swore I would not impose on him the

921
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:13,478
structure that was imposed on me.

922
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:15,561
I took him to synagogues,

923
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:19,696
Buddhist temples,

924
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:24,462
oh, we even went to a
Roman mass one Sunday.

925
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:28,899
That was his favorite.

926
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,433
He just loved all the robes.

927
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:37,780
- That should've given
you a clue right there.

928
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,697
Sweetie, I've done a lot of livin',

929
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,774
and one thing I've learned,

930
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,107
and it's all so very simple,

931
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:51,578
it's all about L-O-V-E.

932
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:02,335
Lucy, two more shots of tequila.

933
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:09,409
- You know, and how 'bout
one of those cigarettes?

934
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:12,003
You know, when I was in college,

935
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:15,503
my sorority sisters and I, um, shared one.

936
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:23,168
(coughing)

937
00:50:27,574 --> 00:50:29,717
That's (coughing)

938
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:31,512
yeah.
(glasses clink)

939
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:32,345
Oh, yeah.

940
00:50:32,345 --> 00:50:34,129
- [Terry] So, remember,
relax, don't be nervous.

941
00:50:34,129 --> 00:50:34,962
- Okay.

942
00:50:34,962 --> 00:50:36,581
- When you first meet
them, be really funny,

943
00:50:36,581 --> 00:50:38,446
say something witty, like,
straight off the back,

944
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:40,899
drop a joke, and be really playful.

945
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:43,530
- Okay, playful, funny, wait, no,

946
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,435
funny, funny then playful.
- Sexy.

947
00:50:45,435 --> 00:50:46,485
Charming.

948
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:47,318
- Okay.

949
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:48,572
- And passionate.
- Passionate.

950
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:50,360
- And don't be geeky or ugly.

951
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,565
You're gonna be great actually.

952
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:52,398
- Allright.

953
00:50:52,398 --> 00:50:54,135
- You're looking really handsome tonight.

954
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:54,968
- Thanks.

955
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,316
- And that was sincere.

956
00:50:56,316 --> 00:50:57,778
Me being sincere.

957
00:50:57,778 --> 00:50:58,684
What are you taking now?

958
00:50:58,684 --> 00:50:59,900
- Just some decongestants.

959
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,632
My allergies are going crazy right now.

960
00:51:01,632 --> 00:51:02,506
- Don't be ridiculous.

961
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:04,006
- No, wait, don't.

962
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:07,633
- That's better.

963
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:12,378
- Shouldn't I be able to
see the guys and breathe?

964
00:51:12,378 --> 00:51:13,465
- Go.

965
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:14,965
Go get 'em, tiger.

966
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:19,994
(car beeps)

967
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,165
(soft chattering)

968
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:25,666
- Hi.
- Hi, what's up?

969
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,337
- Well, welcome to the
first ever bar dating night

970
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:28,873
at the Silver Fox.

971
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:31,614
Here is some stuff for
you to fill out and.

972
00:51:31,614 --> 00:51:32,447
- Thank you.

973
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:33,364
- Um, yeah.

974
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,589
- Yep.
- Okay.

975
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:38,921
(soft chattering)

976
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:40,404
- Oh my god, come on.
- Oh, get in there

977
00:51:40,404 --> 00:51:41,362
and have a good time.

978
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:42,614
We're gonna be...
- Let's get a drink.

979
00:51:42,614 --> 00:51:43,681
- We're not gonna be a problem, right?

980
00:51:43,681 --> 00:51:45,603
- He's just a little bit
scared and bit nervous.

981
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,947
- Well, oh, there he goes.

982
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:50,974
(soft chattering)

983
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:53,921
- How long have you lived in the city?

984
00:51:53,921 --> 00:51:56,302
- So, how long have you had your kitty?

985
00:51:56,302 --> 00:51:57,219
- My kitty!

986
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:00,586
She died last night.

987
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:02,107
(crying)

988
00:52:02,107 --> 00:52:05,297
- Oh, um.
(crying)

989
00:52:05,297 --> 00:52:06,987
- It was terrible.

990
00:52:06,987 --> 00:52:09,070
(crying)

991
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:12,535
I'm sorry.

992
00:52:12,535 --> 00:52:13,702
- That's okay.

993
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:18,817
Um, how long did you have her?

994
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:20,900
(crying)

995
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:25,587
- Three days. (crying)

996
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,167
- Um, how does this guy look?

997
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:31,167
- Cute, young, but cute.

998
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:34,318
- So, you're really cute.

999
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:37,253
- Fierce.

1000
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,743
Yeah, I still use that word.

1001
00:52:38,743 --> 00:52:39,697
Do you wanna know why?

1002
00:52:39,697 --> 00:52:41,116
'Cause it works.

1003
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,983
(crying)

1004
00:52:43,983 --> 00:52:46,467
- There's some of her right there.

1005
00:52:46,467 --> 00:52:48,550
(crying)

1006
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:53,450
- I really like older guys.

1007
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,349
I mean, as long as they're not super old.

1008
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:56,730
You know, like, over 30.

1009
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,149
Oh my god, can you imagine?

1010
00:52:58,149 --> 00:53:00,188
It's all saggy and hanging down.

1011
00:53:00,188 --> 00:53:02,271
(crying)

1012
00:53:05,026 --> 00:53:06,466
I like to design clothes.

1013
00:53:06,466 --> 00:53:08,154
It's actually because I'm a
big fan of Project Runway,

1014
00:53:08,154 --> 00:53:09,319
oh, and American Idol.

1015
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,486
Oh my god, I actually tried
out for American Idol.

1016
00:53:11,486 --> 00:53:13,607
Do you wanna hear what I sang?

1017
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,812
♫ My my my

1018
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:17,729
♫ Love

1019
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:21,179
That Simon is such an ass.

1020
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:24,513
(soft chattering)

1021
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:25,926
- Wait, what?

1022
00:53:25,926 --> 00:53:27,921
- Is there something wrong with you?

1023
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:29,622
- But do you own kitties?

1024
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:31,146
- Um, I'm allergic.

1025
00:53:31,146 --> 00:53:33,146
(gasps)

1026
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:36,106
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1027
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:39,398
(soft chattering)

1028
00:53:39,398 --> 00:53:41,231
- You should sit down.

1029
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:46,782
- So, um, Terry took my
glasses, so I can't see poop,

1030
00:53:46,782 --> 00:53:49,072
but, um, anyway, you're not
gonna sing me a song, are you?

1031
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:50,876
This other guy tried to
sing me a song, and, like,

1032
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:52,322
I don't think it was gonna
be very good or anything.

1033
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:53,633
He said he was on American Idol.

1034
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:54,730
Have you been on American Idol before?

1035
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,441
I don't even think I've ever
even seen the show before.

1036
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,607
I think it's a singing show though.

1037
00:53:57,607 --> 00:54:00,182
You kind of look familiar,
have I seen you before, huh?

1038
00:54:00,182 --> 00:54:01,741
You, like, sort of have a face like.

1039
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:03,548
Ow!
(thuds)

1040
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:05,798
- I was at Becca's wedding.

1041
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,970
(chuckles)

1042
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:11,400
- Okay, this might sting
a little bit, all right?

1043
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,594
Okay, it might sting.
- Ow, ow.

1044
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:13,649
- [Terry] It's gonna help.

1045
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:14,482
- Ow, okay.

1046
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:15,315
- [Terry] It's gonna really help,

1047
00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:18,056
it'll bring down the swelling.

1048
00:54:18,056 --> 00:54:22,042
- So, you mean you're not his boyfriend?

1049
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:25,518
- No, actually we just work in
the same nonprofit together.

1050
00:54:25,518 --> 00:54:28,161
- Terry convinced me that
you must be his boyfriend.

1051
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:29,482
- No, I didn't, I didn't.

1052
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:31,849
- Yes, ow, yes, you did, Terry.

1053
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:33,534
That's why I went on that
stupid speed dating thing

1054
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:34,367
with him.

1055
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:35,763
Will you please tell Jim

1056
00:54:35,763 --> 00:54:37,240
that it was just a stupid
speed dating thing,

1057
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,262
and that I really, really like him,

1058
00:54:39,262 --> 00:54:41,747
and that it was all Terry's fault?

1059
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:42,914
How's it look?

1060
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:46,655
- [Terry] You can hardly see it.

1061
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:47,988
- My head hurts.

1062
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:50,807
- Well, that is normally what happens

1063
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:53,872
when you fall off a
stool and bang your head.

1064
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:55,763
You'll be fine, all right?

1065
00:54:55,763 --> 00:54:56,930
Rest up, okay?

1066
00:54:57,788 --> 00:54:58,746
Bye.

1067
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:00,283
- [Paul] Bye.

1068
00:55:00,283 --> 00:55:01,530
- Feel better, Paul.

1069
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,500
- [Paul] Thanks.

1070
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,101
- Nice lamp.

1071
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,684
- [Paul] Thank you.

1072
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:08,704
(phone rings)

1073
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:10,019
- [Answering Machine] Hello,
please leave a message

1074
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:12,103
after the tone. (beeps)

1075
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,020
- Doctor, this is Paul.

1076
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:18,110
I went on this stupid
speed dating thing tonight,

1077
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,184
and it was the worst day of my life.

1078
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:22,756
Will you please call me back?

1079
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:24,756
I really need your help.

1080
00:55:25,787 --> 00:55:27,123
Thanks.

1081
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,123
(beeps)

1082
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:33,508
- Poor, poor, Paul.

1083
00:55:41,035 --> 00:55:41,868
- Ow.

1084
00:55:46,391 --> 00:55:47,641
- Speed dating.

1085
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:50,458
What's that?

1086
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,165
You run to dates?

1087
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:56,453
I'm talking to you.

1088
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,161
(TV chatter in foreign language)

1089
00:55:58,161 --> 00:56:00,076
(wind noise)

1090
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:01,659
- Please,

1091
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:02,617
help,

1092
00:56:02,617 --> 00:56:03,950
please,

1093
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,592

1094
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:06,425

1095
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,354
(clanking)

1096
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,712
♫ Is that it

1097
00:56:28,443 --> 00:56:31,443
♫ Is that all I get

1098
00:56:33,412 --> 00:56:35,912
♫ I want more

1099
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,911
♫ More than before

1100
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:44,884
- I am telling you, when
I don't know what I want.

1101
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:47,670
♫ If that's all I get

1102
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,503
- I make a collage.

1103
00:56:48,503 --> 00:56:52,747
♫ Then baby I mustn't forget

1104
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:56,914
♫ That I gotta go get on with the show and

1105
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,830
♫ Get on with it

1106
00:57:02,623 --> 00:57:06,322
- [Peggy B] And when I was
22, the world was mine.

1107
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,905
- Helps me tap into the higher power now.

1108
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:10,564
- [Peggy B] Success,
life and love were all

1109
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:11,731
coming my way.

1110
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:15,039
And then my young heart got broken

1111
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,495
into a million pieces

1112
00:57:17,495 --> 00:57:20,687
and I knew I would never be the same.

1113
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,963
I cried for a week.

1114
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:22,796
- Collage.

1115
00:57:22,796 --> 00:57:25,409
- [Peggy B] And when
my tears finally dried

1116
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,659
I asked myself

1117
00:57:27,691 --> 00:57:28,608
is that it?

1118
00:57:30,256 --> 00:57:31,756
Is that all I get?

1119
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:36,595
♫ Is that it

1120
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,121
♫ All I get

1121
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:44,202
♫ I want more

1122
00:57:45,332 --> 00:57:48,665
- You have papers stuck to your fingers.

1123
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:51,909
- Thanks, Rapheal.

1124
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:53,826
Did I do good, Rebecca?

1125
00:57:54,913 --> 00:57:55,746
- Well,

1126
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:00,306
there's, there's a lot of

1127
00:58:01,325 --> 00:58:02,158
big there.

1128
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:08,145
A lot of big, and I would, yeah,

1129
00:58:09,006 --> 00:58:13,147
yeah, I would definitely say
that you know what you want,

1130
00:58:13,147 --> 00:58:14,884
at least part of it anyway.

1131
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:16,487
- Hello, darlings.

1132
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:18,172
- What are you doing here?

1133
00:58:18,172 --> 00:58:20,000
(chuckles)

1134
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,805
- Oh my, what do we have here, a little,

1135
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:24,055
little collage?

1136
00:58:25,687 --> 00:58:29,431
- I bet if you take
some, like, soapy water

1137
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:31,764
that'll take the papers off.

1138
00:58:34,986 --> 00:58:36,486
I like that couch.

1139
00:58:37,993 --> 00:58:42,160
- All you need are rainbows
and unicorns, all that.

1140
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,789
- I just go online if
I want to find a date.

1141
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,706
- Kinda looks like Jim.

1142
00:58:56,547 --> 00:58:59,006
- I will never do that again.

1143
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:01,329
I'm a complete failure.

1144
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,162
- Paul,

1145
00:59:03,537 --> 00:59:04,620
I would never

1146
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:06,903
ever set you up

1147
00:59:06,903 --> 00:59:09,945
with somebody who was
married or had a boyfriend.

1148
00:59:09,945 --> 00:59:11,202
I love you, sweetheart,

1149
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:14,285
but you can be so gullible sometimes.

1150
00:59:17,126 --> 00:59:19,849
Can I ask you a question?

1151
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:22,016
What's Terry's motivation?

1152
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:30,657
I do know that Jim did
talk an awful lot about you

1153
00:59:30,657 --> 00:59:31,947
the other night.

1154
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:32,780
- He did?

1155
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:36,396
- Hand me the phone.

1156
00:59:36,396 --> 00:59:39,396
(soft violin music)

1157
00:59:40,466 --> 00:59:41,966
Hand me the phone.

1158
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:49,172
- Be careful.

1159
00:59:51,828 --> 00:59:54,021
(laid-back music)

1160
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:56,682
Don't push the buttons too hard.

1161
00:59:56,682 --> 00:59:59,329
(laid-back rhythmic music)

1162
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,236
- Hello, Jim.

1163
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:04,819
(laid-back rhythmic music)

1164
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:18,464
- Wow.

1165
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:22,741
- This is lamb pops
with a cherry reduction

1166
01:00:22,741 --> 01:00:25,408
and fingerling potatoes and, um,

1167
01:00:27,118 --> 01:00:29,785
roasted carrots and fennel bulb.

1168
01:00:31,456 --> 01:00:32,924
- That's it?

1169
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:34,341
I'm just kidding.

1170
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:36,636
Looks great.

1171
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,078
- Really?

1172
01:00:40,078 --> 01:00:41,078
- Thank you.

1173
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:43,984
- I'm a little nervous.

1174
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:46,065
- Cheers.

1175
01:00:46,065 --> 01:00:49,648

1176
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,491
Oh my god, it's really good.

(laid-back rhythmic music)

1178
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:50,287
You got it?
- Yeah.

1179
01:01:50,287 --> 01:01:51,454
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1180
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:54,784
Oh, I fucked that up.

1181
01:01:54,784 --> 01:01:57,804
(chuckles)

1182
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:59,470
- So?

1183
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,303
- Yes?

1184
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:02,713
Tell me.

1185
01:02:02,713 --> 01:02:05,482
- So, I, I like him.
- Tell me.

1186
01:02:05,482 --> 01:02:07,018
(chuckles)

1187
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:10,185
- And I'm gonna see him again tonight.

1188
01:02:11,351 --> 01:02:13,119
- I love that.

1189
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,755
I love it.

1190
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:16,094
I love playing gay maker.

1191
01:02:16,094 --> 01:02:17,844
- Yeah, I bet you do.

1192
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:23,341
And you know, Marco
started seeing Terry, too.

1193
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:25,758
- No, no, I didn't know that.

1194
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:31,314
(solemn country music)

1195
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:38,193
- How you doin' today, honey?

1196
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:39,778
- I'm fine.

1197
01:02:39,778 --> 01:02:42,097
- Stayin' another day?

1198
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:44,565
- I'm not ready to see anyone yet.

1199
01:02:44,565 --> 01:02:47,065
- Clear the mind, always good.

1200
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,808
I like playing the slots.

1201
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,641
It's my

1202
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:53,558
meditation.

1203
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:57,133
Why don't you give mine a whirl?

1204
01:02:57,133 --> 01:02:57,966

Do you feel loved?

1211
01:03:46,492 --> 01:03:49,900
- [Tootsie] Well you sure
know how to ask questions.

1212
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,150
- Well, do you?

1213
01:03:54,227 --> 01:03:57,644
- Yes, yes, I, uh, I need to call my son.

(slot machine beeps)

1215

- This is my one and only love.

1216

I take it with me wherever I go,

1217
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,599
and whenever I'm feeling lonely,

1218
01:04:15,457 --> 01:04:17,576
I look at it so I can remember that

1219
01:04:17,576 --> 01:04:20,493
for at least one moment of my life,

1220
01:04:21,348 --> 01:04:22,348
I was loved.

1221

- $5,000.

$5,000, are you kidding?

Oh my god, Lucy, I need a drink!

yeah, I was six, I think.

1241
01:05:21,272 --> 01:05:24,115
Yeah, because I saw her
in a Christmas special,

1249
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,555
and I tried to bid on it,

1250

1262
01:06:06,523 --> 01:06:09,273
♫ Get on with it

1263
01:06:11,324 --> 01:06:14,425
- [Peggy B] When I was 36 years old

1264
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:16,485
♫ I thought my life was over

1265
01:06:16,485 --> 01:06:18,093
- Um, eyelash.
- I what?

1266
01:06:18,093 --> 01:06:18,926
- Eyelash.

1267
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:23,851
- [Peggy B] And I thought I was through,

1268
01:06:23,851 --> 01:06:26,959
after years of trying to
make something of myself.

1269
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:28,376
- That's my wish.

1270
01:06:30,313 --> 01:06:31,506
(blows)

1271
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:33,822
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry.

1272
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:35,644
- It's okay.

1273
01:06:35,644 --> 01:06:37,763
- God, it wasn't a bullet,
it was just an eyelash.

1274
01:06:37,763 --> 01:06:38,868
You all right?

1275
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:40,451
- Yeah, I think so.

1276
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,882
It's okay, it's fine.

1277
01:06:42,882 --> 01:06:44,629
What'd you wish for?

1278
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:46,046
- I can't tell you.

1279
01:06:46,046 --> 01:06:47,754
It won't come true.

1280
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,004
The rules.
- Good, ow, okay.

1281
01:06:52,805 --> 01:06:56,556
So you know this whole marriage thing?

1282
01:06:56,556 --> 01:06:59,473
It's kinda got me thinkin', I mean,

1283
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,362
for the first time in our lives

1284
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:04,447
we actually have the opportunity
to get married, I mean,

1285
01:07:04,447 --> 01:07:06,590
I never thought that
I'd ever actually see it

1286
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,465
in my lifetime, you know?

1287
01:07:08,465 --> 01:07:09,923
- No,

1288
01:07:09,923 --> 01:07:10,769
me either.

1289
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:13,555
I mean, I'm out there every
day trying to get these

1290
01:07:13,555 --> 01:07:15,555
simpleminded ignoramuses

1291
01:07:17,138 --> 01:07:19,686
to not take away our rights,

1292
01:07:19,686 --> 01:07:22,457
you know, it just makes
me, it makes me so angry.

1293
01:07:22,457 --> 01:07:23,540
- Yeah, yeah.

1294
01:07:29,507 --> 01:07:33,090
do you ever think that you, maybe want to,

1295
01:07:34,268 --> 01:07:37,935
yeah, I don't know, um,
get married just to,

1296
01:07:38,953 --> 01:07:42,495
you know, just before they
take away the right to make a,

1297
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:44,508
make a statement or something?

1298
01:07:44,508 --> 01:07:46,091
- Oh, I don't know.

1299
01:07:47,799 --> 01:07:50,531
I don't wanna be forced into
something that I might...

1300
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:51,923
- Oh, yeah, no.

1301
01:07:51,923 --> 01:07:54,623
- You know, regret later.
- Mm-mm, no, yeah, no.

1302
01:07:54,623 --> 01:07:57,956
(laid-back jazzy music)

1303
01:08:01,084 --> 01:08:01,917
- What?

1304
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:08,134
Do you wanna get married?

1305
01:08:08,134 --> 01:08:11,551
No, I mean, not to, you know, in general.

1306
01:08:13,426 --> 01:08:14,732
- Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.

1307
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:15,929
- You do?

1308
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,397
- Well, I mean, maybe, yeah, mm-hmm.

1309
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:19,259
Why, is that bad?

1310
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:20,217
- No.
- Okay.

1311
01:08:20,217 --> 01:08:24,340
(laid-back jazzy music)

1312
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,513
(gasps)

1313
01:08:25,513 --> 01:08:26,346
What?

1314
01:08:26,346 --> 01:08:27,429
- Wait, just,

1315
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:30,780
oh what the heck.
- Yeah.

1316
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:34,863
♫ Five-Star restaurants

1317
01:08:34,863 --> 01:08:38,298
♫ Eating out has always been my favorite

1318
01:08:38,298 --> 01:08:40,033
- Where Paul?

1319
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:40,950
He no call.

1320
01:08:44,345 --> 01:08:45,178
Stupid.

1321
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:50,161
(TV chatter in foreign language)

1322
01:09:17,347 --> 01:09:19,347
(sighs)

1323
01:09:27,895 --> 01:09:30,728
(coffee trickles)

1324
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,633
(yells)

1325
01:09:37,499 --> 01:09:38,492
- Sorry.

1326
01:09:38,492 --> 01:09:40,572
(coughing)

1327
01:09:40,572 --> 01:09:43,221
(smoke alarm beeps)

1328
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,328
I have a meeting I have
to go to this morning.

1329
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:46,272
- Yeah?
- This morning.

1330
01:09:46,272 --> 01:09:47,269
- Okay.

1331
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:48,382
- Uh, around the corner.

1332
01:09:48,382 --> 01:09:49,340
- Wait, what?

1333
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,160
- There's a coffee shop around the corner.

1334
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,638
- Okay.

1335
01:09:52,638 --> 01:09:55,638
(smoke alarm beeps)

1336
01:09:57,642 --> 01:10:00,059
(horn beeps)

1337
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,929
(traffic rumbles)

1338
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:29,646
- Morning, boss, you look good.

1339
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:31,271
So how'd the date go?

1340
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:34,165
It looks like it went well.

1341
01:10:34,165 --> 01:10:35,889
- [Terry] That's marvelous.

1342
01:10:35,889 --> 01:10:37,933
- You know, I'm not
even mad at you, Terry,

1343
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,808
for almost sabotaging it.

1344
01:10:39,808 --> 01:10:41,750
Oh, did Miss Anderson say
what this emergency meeting

1345
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,583
was for?

1346
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,980
- No, she didn't, she just
said she wanted a meeting.

1347
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,095
- It has come to our attention

1348
01:10:48,095 --> 01:10:51,136
that Proposition 8 may not pass.

1349
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:55,183
Here, in California, we
cannot allow the homosexuals

1350
01:10:55,183 --> 01:10:56,925
the right to marry.

1351
01:10:56,925 --> 01:11:00,342
What can we do to take this message home?

1352
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:03,443
- Um.

1353
01:11:06,759 --> 01:11:07,592
Uh, well,

1354
01:11:11,459 --> 01:11:14,792
we can have a basic html made up

1355
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:15,625
with this

1356
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:17,708
logo and the,

1357
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:22,406
yes on Proposition 8 added,

1358
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:25,339
so that everyone on Tuesday
morning will wake up

1359
01:11:25,339 --> 01:11:27,014
with this reminder in their inbox.

1360
01:11:27,014 --> 01:11:28,405
It's a little too late for the commercial,

1361
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:32,272
but I do believe that the
email blast across the state

1362
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:34,439
will get the response that

1363
01:11:36,355 --> 01:11:37,272
you desire.

1364
01:11:39,722 --> 01:11:40,889
- Good, do it.

1365
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:45,948
- I'm afraid I'm not feeling too good.

1366
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:06,848
- Thank you very much,
Paul, you have been great.

1367
01:12:06,848 --> 01:12:10,889
- Your partner is a bit, uh, high strung.

1368
01:12:10,889 --> 01:12:12,653
- What I believe he's tryin' to say

1369
01:12:12,653 --> 01:12:15,903
is you're just more our type of people.

1370
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,897
Let's meet up here next Wednesday

1371
01:12:18,897 --> 01:12:20,677
and discuss our attack.
(phone rings)

1372
01:12:20,677 --> 01:12:22,503
Shall we say 9 a.m.?

1373
01:12:22,503 --> 01:12:26,137
And maybe it's best if it's
just you at the meetin'.

1374
01:12:26,137 --> 01:12:30,304
Your partner makes the boys
feel a little uncomfortable.

1375
01:12:40,038 --> 01:12:41,741
- Did you see where Terry went?

1376
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:43,106
- He went to the little boy's room.

1377
01:12:43,106 --> 01:12:45,023
He didn't look so good.

1378
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:49,470
(phone rings)

1379
01:12:50,854 --> 01:12:53,604
(water trickles)

1380
01:12:55,844 --> 01:12:57,695
- Look, wait.

1381
01:12:57,695 --> 01:13:00,193
I didn't know that this
was how it was going to go.

1382
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:01,026
I didn't.

1383
01:13:02,264 --> 01:13:03,931
- What you gonna do?

1384
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:09,866
- Terry, if we let go of
this account, we'll go under.

1385
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:14,941
- I know I was hypnotized by the money.

1386
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:17,358
My stomach was sick in there.

1387
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:21,986
I can't do this.

1388
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:26,924
I can't, I can't work, I can't
work for someone who can.

1389
01:13:26,924 --> 01:13:28,296
Sorry.

1390
01:13:28,296 --> 01:13:29,129
- Why,

1391
01:13:30,465 --> 01:13:34,176
why didn't you want me to be with Jim?

1392
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:37,542
- So you can manipulate him and marry him

1393
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:39,625
before the Prop 8 passes?

1394
01:13:41,445 --> 01:13:44,945
You might be the main reason it does pass.

1395
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:49,777
- I don't see you returning the check.

1396
01:14:15,982 --> 01:14:17,732
- Just a little check

1397
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:21,691
and the family.

1398
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:25,251
(crying)

1399
01:14:25,251 --> 01:14:26,084
I'm sorry.

1400
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:36,845
Yeah, Jim, hang on a second, okay?

1401
01:14:39,005 --> 01:14:42,922
Get me all the dirt that
you can on The Family.

1402
01:14:44,662 --> 01:14:46,605
- Sir, yes, sir!

1403
01:14:46,605 --> 01:14:47,438
- Thanks.

1404
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:49,223
Okay.

1405
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:00,484
- Really?

1406
01:15:00,484 --> 01:15:01,984
Okay, thanks, bye.

1407
01:15:03,076 --> 01:15:05,576
(phone rings)

1408
01:15:09,352 --> 01:15:10,654
- Yep?

1409
01:15:10,654 --> 01:15:13,248
- Boss, I finally got
the skinny on this guy.

1410
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:15,610
So, on the outside he looks totally clean,

1411
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,753
like he should get a
frackin' medal or something,

1412
01:15:17,753 --> 01:15:19,277
but then the truth comes out

1413
01:15:19,277 --> 01:15:20,845
and he's got his grubby little fingers

1414
01:15:20,845 --> 01:15:24,967
into so many dirty pots,
foreign oil, arms dealing,

1415
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:28,818
racketeering and, this is the best part,

1416
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:32,974
there's some very interesting
rumors surrounding him, too.

1417
01:15:32,974 --> 01:15:34,834
- Great, Tess.

1418
01:15:34,834 --> 01:15:37,303
- Thanks, so what do you want me to do?

1419
01:15:37,303 --> 01:15:39,505
- Oh.
(knocking)

1420
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:42,524
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

1421
01:15:42,524 --> 01:15:43,357
Bye.

1422
01:15:48,554 --> 01:15:50,554
(sighs)

1423
01:16:00,605 --> 01:16:01,688
- The Family,

1424
01:16:03,272 --> 01:16:04,189
The fuckin'

1425
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:07,438
Family, Paul.

1426
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:10,648
How could you?

1427
01:16:11,618 --> 01:16:12,576
- They, they just wanted me to do...

1428
01:16:12,576 --> 01:16:13,669
- With what?

1429
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:14,628
With their money?
- Do these sappy,

1430
01:16:14,628 --> 01:16:15,728
little commercials.
- How much money

1431
01:16:15,728 --> 01:16:18,224
did they give you, Paul?

1432
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:19,057
How much?

1433
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:24,721
How much did it take for you
to fuck everyone you know?

1434
01:16:27,137 --> 01:16:27,970
Me.

1435
01:16:29,509 --> 01:16:32,259
Paul, what are you fucking doing?

1436
01:16:40,605 --> 01:16:42,605
You can make this right.

1437
01:16:43,839 --> 01:16:45,437
Okay?

1438
01:16:45,437 --> 01:16:47,453
You can make this right.

1439
01:16:47,453 --> 01:16:49,568
But you better do it now.

1440
01:16:49,568 --> 01:16:50,899
Do you understand me?

1441
01:16:50,899 --> 01:16:54,097
Or your life is going to end
in disaster, I promise you.

1442
01:16:54,097 --> 01:16:55,347
Do you hear me?

1443
01:16:58,183 --> 01:16:59,433
Do you hear me?

1444
01:17:03,282 --> 01:17:04,865
- Did Jim find out?

1445
01:17:09,566 --> 01:17:12,399
- I'll let you guys talk about it.

1446
01:17:19,252 --> 01:17:20,805
- Paul.

1447
01:17:20,805 --> 01:17:22,414
- Jim.

1448
01:17:22,414 --> 01:17:25,914
- Listen, I have, I have feelings for you.

1449
01:17:27,926 --> 01:17:28,759
I'm sorry,

1450
01:17:30,259 --> 01:17:31,092
I'm just,

1451
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:36,259
I'm so confused right now.

1452
01:18:09,697 --> 01:18:12,197
(phone rings)

1453
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:22,380
- Hello.

1454
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,213
- Paul,

1455
01:18:24,852 --> 01:18:27,185
Paul I left your goddamn,

1456
01:18:27,185 --> 01:18:29,406
son of a bitch, fuckface father.

1457
01:18:29,406 --> 01:18:30,406
- Excuse me?

1458
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,992
- It's over between us.

1459
01:18:36,744 --> 01:18:39,494
We had a big, a big disagreement.

1460
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:45,399
- [Paul] What did you
do, go buy a new dress?

1461
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:47,868
He'll get over it, just, um.

1462
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:51,035
- It's not that easy this time, honey.

1463
01:18:54,894 --> 01:18:56,873
- Just call him, okay?

1464
01:18:56,873 --> 01:18:59,040
Yeah, just, just call him.

1465
01:19:00,322 --> 01:19:01,905
- Paul, I love you.

1466
01:19:03,802 --> 01:19:05,860
I love you, okay?

1467
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,693
Bye-bye.

1468
01:19:07,685 --> 01:19:10,061
(phone clangs)

1469
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:10,894
- Ah.

1470
01:19:26,453 --> 01:19:27,719
- I can't.

1471
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,802
(crying)

1472
01:19:30,897 --> 01:19:34,916
This stupid stuff. (crying)

1473
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:36,731
That works, nothing.

1474
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,814
(crying)

1475
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:52,251
I gotta see Paul.

1476
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,978
- How much money did they give you, Paul?

1477
01:19:58,978 --> 01:19:59,811
How much?

1478
01:20:01,524 --> 01:20:05,691
How much did it take for you
to fuck everyone you know?

1479
01:20:07,413 --> 01:20:10,053
- I have feelings for you

1480
01:20:10,053 --> 01:20:13,718
that I haven't felt in a long time.

1481
01:20:13,718 --> 01:20:15,649
- I can't do this,

1482
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:18,816
and I can't work for someone that can.

1483
01:20:21,327 --> 01:20:23,155
(ringtone rings)

1484
01:20:23,155 --> 01:20:25,224
- Who the hell is that
at this time of night?

1485
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:27,807
- Oh god, I hope nobody's dead.

1486
01:20:28,844 --> 01:20:30,939
Boss, what is going on?

1487
01:20:30,939 --> 01:20:32,070
- Sorry, Tess.

1488
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:34,405
- Oh my god, you gave me a heart attack.

1489
01:20:34,405 --> 01:20:37,509
- I need you to pull the
whole plug on The Family.

1490
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:39,657
Cancel everything.

1491
01:20:39,657 --> 01:20:41,365
Do you think it's too late?

1492
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:42,704
- Well, it'll take some doing,

1493
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,045
but I think I can get it done.

1494
01:20:45,045 --> 01:20:46,253
Hey, boss.

1495
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:47,255
- [Paul] Yeah?

1496
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:48,838
- I'm proud of you.

1497
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:51,773
- Thanks, Tess.

1498
01:20:51,773 --> 01:20:56,376
Oh, Tess, set up a meeting
with Miss Deborah Anderson

1499
01:20:56,376 --> 01:20:58,441
for nine in the morning, okay?

1500
01:20:58,441 --> 01:21:00,157
- Okay-dokey, boss.

1501
01:21:00,157 --> 01:21:00,990
- Thanks.

1502
01:21:01,943 --> 01:21:02,998
Goodnight.

1503
01:21:02,998 --> 01:21:04,915
- See ya tomorrow, bye.

1504
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:07,086
Sugar, I need that.

1505
01:21:07,086 --> 01:21:09,212
- Oh, darling, come on, it's
taken me months to get this.

1506
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:11,423
- (groans) I need to send some emails.

1507
01:21:11,423 --> 01:21:13,203
- Why do you women never understand?

1508
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:14,265
(chuckles)

1509
01:21:14,265 --> 01:21:15,987
- You can get back to your little game.

1510
01:21:15,987 --> 01:21:17,993
- Yeah, well, my raiding party
was about to kill the boss.

1511
01:21:17,993 --> 01:21:19,392
You've gone and ruined it now, haven't ya?

1512
01:21:19,392 --> 01:21:21,892
- Well, that sounds important.

1513
01:21:31,142 --> 01:21:33,642
(blues music)

1514
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:38,681
- I'd help you, but I
can't see a damn thing.

1515
01:21:39,682 --> 01:21:41,825
So what's up for today?

1516
01:21:41,825 --> 01:21:45,248
I've got a few hours to
kill before I head out.

1517
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:47,799
Wanna try the nickel slots again?

1518
01:21:47,799 --> 01:21:51,726
Or should we be adventurous
and go for the quarters?

1519
01:21:51,726 --> 01:21:55,893
(chuckles)
(blues music)

1520
01:21:56,985 --> 01:22:00,845
- You know I, I think
it's time I get on my way.

1521
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:03,345
(blues music)

1522
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,833
I'm gonna miss you.

1523
01:22:15,504 --> 01:22:16,337
Thank you.

1524
01:22:18,381 --> 01:22:19,214
Thank you.

1525
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:22,683
♫ not mend my broken heart

1526
01:22:22,683 --> 01:22:25,683
♫ With somebody new

1527
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:31,573
♫ Because I can't keep on livin'

1528
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:36,500
♫ In a world without you

1529
01:22:37,856 --> 01:22:41,144
(phone rings)

1530
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:42,405
(answering machine beeps)

1531
01:22:42,405 --> 01:22:44,554
- Terry, I know you quit,

1532
01:22:44,554 --> 01:22:48,605
and I know that you're
really mad at me right now,

1533
01:22:48,605 --> 01:22:50,958
but please just come to
a nine o'clock meeting

1534
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:52,933
with Miss Anderson.

1535
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:54,350
Trust me, please.

1536
01:22:56,601 --> 01:22:57,434
Trust me.

1537
01:22:58,323 --> 01:23:01,966
♫ To dry all these tears I cried

1538
01:23:01,966 --> 01:23:06,348
- [GPS] Please make right
turn on Sierra Highway.

1539
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,879
Please make right turn on Sierra Highway.

1540
01:23:09,879 --> 01:23:13,129
(solemn country music)

1541
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:21,541
- Come on.

1542
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:27,848
(brakes squeal)

1543
01:23:27,848 --> 01:23:32,015
♫ My broken heart with somebody new

1544
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:39,904
♫ Because I can't keep on livin'

1545
01:23:41,257 --> 01:23:43,302
- Excuse me, Miss.

1546
01:23:43,302 --> 01:23:44,135
- Yeah?

1547
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,443
You look terrible.

1548
01:23:49,443 --> 01:23:51,724
You better sit down.

1549
01:23:51,724 --> 01:23:54,425
Here, here's a glass of water.

1550
01:23:54,425 --> 01:23:56,065
You better have some, here, here, here,

1551
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:57,840
here's a little bit of,

1552
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,947
oh, you just look terrible.

1553
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:03,302
I don't know what happened to you.

1554
01:24:03,302 --> 01:24:05,986
You look like you have a little sunburn

1555
01:24:05,986 --> 01:24:07,661
or something like that.

1556
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:09,346
- I'm lookin' for my wife.

1557
01:24:09,346 --> 01:24:10,179
- Oh?

1558
01:24:10,179 --> 01:24:13,346
- Little short gal, mid 40s, red hair,

1559
01:24:14,641 --> 01:24:15,748
Mrs. Roll.

1560
01:24:15,748 --> 01:24:16,727
- Mrs. Roll.

1561
01:24:16,727 --> 01:24:18,275
- Go by the nickname, uh...

1562
01:24:18,275 --> 01:24:19,367
- Tootsie!

1563
01:24:19,367 --> 01:24:20,518
- Yeah.

1564
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:23,040
- (chuckles) She's a kick in the pants.

1565
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:23,883
- Uh-huh.

1566
01:24:23,883 --> 01:24:27,383
- Such a nice lady and a good tipper, too.

1567
01:24:29,415 --> 01:24:32,582
You must be the fuckface of a husband.

1568
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:37,236
Honey, you just missed her.

1569
01:24:38,242 --> 01:24:39,363
Isn't that right, Janine?

1570
01:24:39,363 --> 01:24:40,907
- Yeah, that's right.

1571
01:24:40,907 --> 01:24:43,489
- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

1572
01:24:43,489 --> 01:24:46,156
Here, have a little napkin here.

1573
01:24:47,812 --> 01:24:49,979
- Morning, boss, you okay?

1574
01:24:52,733 --> 01:24:55,361
Okay, here's all the dirt on the big guy,

1575
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:57,778
and here's your refund check.

1576
01:24:59,040 --> 01:24:59,873
What?

1577
01:24:59,873 --> 01:25:03,486
You know I've been doing
your signature for years.

1578
01:25:03,486 --> 01:25:06,309
- You knew I was going to do this?

1579
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:10,226
- You made the appointment
yesterday afternoon.

1580
01:25:11,093 --> 01:25:12,176
- I love you.

1581
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:13,946
- I know.

1582
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:16,746
Now, go knock 'em dead.

1583
01:25:18,186 --> 01:25:21,353
(ragtime piano music)

1584
01:25:47,371 --> 01:25:50,897
- So, Paul, I see that
you had another plan

1585
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:53,785
that you didn't share with us.

1586
01:25:53,785 --> 01:25:57,202
(playful rhythmic music)

1587
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:05,000
- This gentleman is half of, as they say,

1588
01:26:05,969 --> 01:26:08,068
a well-oiled machine.

1589
01:26:08,068 --> 01:26:10,767
To ask that he not be present
during an important meeting

1590
01:26:10,767 --> 01:26:14,074
with a client is inappropriate.

1591
01:26:14,074 --> 01:26:18,241
- May I remind you that
you and I have a contract.

1592
01:26:19,765 --> 01:26:21,608
- Not finished yet.

1593
01:26:21,608 --> 01:26:25,470
Um, Miss Anderson, some time in one's life

1594
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:28,228
one has to question one's morals.

1595
01:26:28,228 --> 01:26:30,523
- I assure you that Jonathan Tate

1596
01:26:30,523 --> 01:26:33,102
is one of the leading men of our country

1597
01:26:33,102 --> 01:26:37,771
with only the highest morals
and the best intentions.

1598
01:26:37,771 --> 01:26:40,109
(tsking)

1599
01:26:40,109 --> 01:26:42,766
- The Jonathan Tates of the
world can look incredibly clean

1600
01:26:42,766 --> 01:26:45,880
on the outside until one digs deeper.

1601
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,880
This morning

1602
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:52,537
there were no email
blasts, no press releases,

1603
01:26:52,537 --> 01:26:55,463
no one heard a peep on The Family's stance

1604
01:26:55,463 --> 01:26:56,880
on Proposition 8.

1605
01:26:57,995 --> 01:26:58,828
Oh and,

1606
01:27:01,949 --> 01:27:02,782
um,

1607
01:27:05,105 --> 01:27:07,105
here's your full refund.

1608
01:27:09,902 --> 01:27:11,069
Miss Anderson,

1609
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:15,852
Miss Anderson I love my country.

1610
01:27:15,852 --> 01:27:18,575
I'm a little idealistic.

1611
01:27:18,575 --> 01:27:19,992
I do believe that

1612
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,696
justice will prevail

1613
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,008
and

1614
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:27,383
you,

1615
01:27:27,383 --> 01:27:28,300
The Family,

1616
01:27:29,759 --> 01:27:30,787
Jonathan Tate,

1617
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:34,620
at the end of the day
can do nothing about it.

1618
01:27:35,608 --> 01:27:37,191
Oh, and by the way,

1619
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:39,732
I'm not one of your

1620
01:27:40,982 --> 01:27:42,232
fudging people.

1621
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:46,826
I'll take these now.

1622
01:27:46,826 --> 01:27:50,076
(light rhythmic music)

1623
01:27:53,131 --> 01:27:54,048
- Mr. Roll,

1624
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:57,702
Proposition 8 will pass.

1625
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:00,371
I guarantee it.

1626
01:28:11,021 --> 01:28:11,854
- Wow.

1627
01:28:14,478 --> 01:28:15,561
You told her.

1628
01:28:17,065 --> 01:28:20,743
- I just wanted you to
understand your worth to me.

1629
01:28:20,743 --> 01:28:21,743
- Come here.

1630
01:28:31,194 --> 01:28:33,611
- Oh for god's sake, come on!

1631
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:36,977
(sighs) I really am fucked.

1632
01:28:36,977 --> 01:28:39,644
(brakes squeal)

1633
01:28:53,642 --> 01:28:54,475
Oh my god.

1634
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:59,163
I didn't realize you were Miss Piggy B.

1635
01:29:01,409 --> 01:29:02,826
Can I get a lift?

1636
01:29:06,785 --> 01:29:09,609
My son is your biggest fan.

1637
01:29:09,609 --> 01:29:10,883
- [Piggy B] What's his name?

1638
01:29:10,883 --> 01:29:12,207
- [Tootsie] Paul Roll.

1639
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:15,790
- [Piggy B] Hmm, well
isn't that somethin'.

1640
01:29:38,809 --> 01:29:40,895
(laughing)
(throbbing music)

1641
01:29:40,895 --> 01:29:43,029
- Look at this place.

1642
01:29:43,029 --> 01:29:45,305
Oh my god, it's election night.

1643
01:29:45,305 --> 01:29:46,536
Paul!

1644
01:29:46,536 --> 01:29:49,711
Paul, I asked you to
fix things last night.

1645
01:29:49,711 --> 01:29:51,108
- What?
- And you did.

1646
01:29:51,108 --> 01:29:55,055
I asked you to fix things
last night and you did.

1647
01:29:55,055 --> 01:29:55,888
- Yeah.

1648
01:29:55,888 --> 01:29:58,382
- Proposition 8 might
not pass because of you.

1649
01:29:58,382 --> 01:29:59,825
Look at this.

1650
01:29:59,825 --> 01:30:02,763
(throbbing music)

1651
01:30:02,763 --> 01:30:06,303
Oh, and by the way, just in
case you're wondering, Jim.

1652
01:30:06,303 --> 01:30:07,136
- Yeah?

1653
01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:08,551
- Everything's cool.

1654
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:10,506
He's so proud of you.

1655
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:12,332
- Wait, you mean he's
not mad at me anymore?

1656
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:13,871
- No, no, not at all.

1657
01:30:13,871 --> 01:30:16,331
As a matter of fact, I think
you're probably gonna get

1658
01:30:16,331 --> 01:30:18,460
the best sex of your life tonight.

1659
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,793
(pulsating music)

1660
01:30:19,793 --> 01:30:20,626
It's true.

1661
01:30:23,183 --> 01:30:24,847
- Wow.

1662
01:30:24,847 --> 01:30:25,909
- Here you go, ladies.

1663
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:27,324
- [Tootsie] Ooh, thanks.

1664
01:30:27,324 --> 01:30:29,536
- You may wanna stay close, Manny.

1665
01:30:29,536 --> 01:30:31,435
We're either gonna be jumping for joy,

1666
01:30:31,435 --> 01:30:33,121
or I'm gonna have to slap ya.

1667
01:30:33,121 --> 01:30:33,958
(chuckles)

1668
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:35,740
- Hey, where's Terry?

1669
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:38,573
(pulsating music)

1670
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:42,118
Um, I've gotta go backstage,

1671
01:30:42,118 --> 01:30:44,445
so I'll see you guys afterwards, okay?

1672
01:30:44,445 --> 01:30:46,241
All right, see ya soon!

1673
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:48,467
(pulsating music)

1674
01:30:48,467 --> 01:30:50,291
- What did she say?

1675
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:53,007
- [Man] Please welcome to the
stage, the legendary comedian

1676
01:30:53,007 --> 01:30:54,911
Miss Rebecca Wright.

1677
01:30:54,911 --> 01:30:56,879
- All right, who's right?

1678
01:30:56,879 --> 01:30:58,764
- [Crowd] Rebecca Wright!

1679
01:30:58,764 --> 01:31:00,125
(cheering)

1680
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:02,581
- And don't you all forget it.

1681
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:04,741
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome

1682
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:08,007
to our election night extravaganza.

1683
01:31:08,007 --> 01:31:10,006
(cheering)
(clapping)

1684
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,114
The end of the Bush era.

1685
01:31:12,114 --> 01:31:13,556
Ladies and gentlemen,

1686
01:31:13,556 --> 01:31:16,304
tonight is a big huge momentous occasion.

1687
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,959
Hopefully we are going to
elect our country's very first

1688
01:31:19,959 --> 01:31:22,127
African-American president.

1689
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:24,137
(cheering)

1690
01:31:24,137 --> 01:31:26,416
It's about time, it's about time.

1691
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:29,264
And hopefully we are gonna
show the rest of the country

1692
01:31:29,264 --> 01:31:31,779
that California is ready

1693
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:34,396
and will protect gay marriage, baby.

1694
01:31:34,396 --> 01:31:35,485
(cheering)

1695
01:31:35,485 --> 01:31:36,568
- I love you!

1696
01:31:38,717 --> 01:31:40,306
- Hey.

1697
01:31:40,306 --> 01:31:41,473
- Oh, hey, hi.

1698
01:31:46,464 --> 01:31:47,605
- I'm so proud of you.

1699
01:31:47,605 --> 01:31:49,682
- Oh, I'm just so glad
you aren't mad at me

1700
01:31:49,682 --> 01:31:50,765
anymore.
- No.

1701
01:31:54,434 --> 01:31:56,442
- [Rebecca] Now, I heard
that we are just waiting

1702
01:31:56,442 --> 01:32:00,450
on the news to announce the next president

1703
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:01,809
of the United States,

1704
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:04,694
and, god, I hope it's the right one.

1705
01:32:04,694 --> 01:32:06,707
(patriotic music)

1706
01:32:06,707 --> 01:32:09,624
- And you go out and find your son.

1707
01:32:10,969 --> 01:32:11,969
- All right.

1708
01:32:13,134 --> 01:32:15,243
- Any second, we're gonna get the results.

1709
01:32:15,243 --> 01:32:18,174
- We can now definitively
say that Barack Obama will be

1710
01:32:18,174 --> 01:32:19,884
the next president of the
United States of America.

1711
01:32:19,884 --> 01:32:21,967
- [Rachel] The next president
of the United States

1712
01:32:21,967 --> 01:32:23,183
is Barack Obama.

1713
01:32:23,183 --> 01:32:26,463
- This is truly an historic occasion.

1714
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:31,206
We now know that the next
president will be Barack Obama,

1715
01:32:31,206 --> 01:32:33,330
our first black president.

1716
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:36,039
(cheering)

1717
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:37,497
- Mom,

1718
01:32:37,497 --> 01:32:38,858
hi!

1719
01:32:38,858 --> 01:32:40,208
- Oh!

1720
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:42,232
I came with B. (laughs)

1721
01:32:42,232 --> 01:32:44,815
- [Rebecca] On this
momentous occasion, ladies

1722
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:48,298
and gentlemen, it is my
immense pleasure to welcome....

1723
01:32:48,298 --> 01:32:49,933
- This is my mom!

1724
01:32:49,933 --> 01:32:50,958
- Hi.

1725
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:52,387
- [Tootsie] Hi.

1726
01:32:52,387 --> 01:32:53,497
- I'm Jim.

1727
01:32:53,497 --> 01:32:55,191
- [Tootsie] Hi, how do you do, Jim?

1728
01:32:55,191 --> 01:32:56,231
- Good.

1729
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:57,504
- Nice to meet you.

1730
01:32:57,504 --> 01:32:59,288
- Nice to meet you, too.

1731
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:03,211
(clapping)
(rhythmic music)

1732
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:05,378
(howling)

1733
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:17,546
♫ You always leave me wantin' more

1734
01:33:17,546 --> 01:33:22,212
♫ You always leave me wantin' more

1735
01:33:22,212 --> 01:33:26,745
♫ You always leave me wantin' more

1736
01:33:26,745 --> 01:33:30,912
(clapping)
(cheering)

1737
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:35,390
- Ladies and gentlemen, that Miss Piggy B.

1738
01:33:36,543 --> 01:33:39,502
All right, now the moment
we've all been waiting for,

1739
01:33:39,502 --> 01:33:42,011
uh, the results of
Proposition 8 are coming

1740
01:33:42,011 --> 01:33:42,969
in any second.

1741
01:33:42,969 --> 01:33:44,523
- We do have an answer
now on Proposition 8.

1742
01:33:44,523 --> 01:33:49,040
Proposition 8 has passed, gay
marriage is no longer legal

1743
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,290
in the state of California.

1744
01:33:52,535 --> 01:33:53,785
- Gay marriage,

1745
01:33:55,305 --> 01:33:57,638
the abomination against God,

1746
01:33:59,037 --> 01:34:02,204
will not be tolerated in this country.

1747
01:34:03,913 --> 01:34:06,163
Marriage will remain sacred

1748
01:34:07,621 --> 01:34:09,288
and that this filth,

1749
01:34:10,525 --> 01:34:14,692
this unbridled filth will not
be tolerated in our country.

1750
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,287
God bless you.

1751
01:34:26,686 --> 01:34:28,857
- [News Anchor] As far as
what will happen to the gays

1752
01:34:28,857 --> 01:34:31,402
who have already married in recent months,

1753
01:34:31,402 --> 01:34:33,809
the news is, we're still
awaiting news on that.

1754
01:34:33,809 --> 01:34:37,365
There'll have to be a judgment,
but for the time being

1755
01:34:37,365 --> 01:34:39,641
no more gays will be allowed to marry

1756
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:41,322
in the state of California.

1757
01:34:41,322 --> 01:34:43,998
Proposition 8 is now law.

1758
01:34:43,998 --> 01:34:46,081
There is no gay marriage.

1759
01:35:06,678 --> 01:35:08,871
(dull thudding)

1760
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:11,454
(door squeaks)

1761
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:19,526
- I have to go find my mom.

1762
01:35:22,488 --> 01:35:24,988
- Obama elected and the other,

1763
01:35:25,946 --> 01:35:26,779
well,

1764
01:35:27,714 --> 01:35:32,064
we'll just have to continue
to fight the good fight.

1765
01:35:32,064 --> 01:35:35,490
- Yeah, yeah, the good fight, um, I.

1766
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:36,625
- [Gregory] We just
got the bank statement.

1767
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:39,708
- I have something I need to confess.

1768
01:35:41,678 --> 01:35:42,511
- Tootsie,

1769
01:35:44,835 --> 01:35:45,918
what is this?

1770
01:35:48,832 --> 01:35:51,665
A $500,000 donation to The Family?

1771
01:35:53,671 --> 01:35:55,338
Are, are you insane?

1772
01:35:56,412 --> 01:35:59,253
- I-I-I acted impulsively, I-I just.

1773
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:02,309
- Impulse, no, no, impulsive
is like buying something

1774
01:36:02,309 --> 01:36:03,429
at the checkout stand!

1775
01:36:03,429 --> 01:36:05,208
Half a million dollars to The Family!

1776
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:07,440
Do you know what this means to your son?

1777
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,349
Do you know what this
is going to do to him?

1778
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:11,711
Oh!

1779
01:36:11,711 --> 01:36:14,319
I mean, you have done
some crazy stunts, Toots,

1780
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:16,447
but this is outrageous!

1781
01:36:16,447 --> 01:36:19,254
How could you, how could
you do that to Paulie?

1782
01:36:19,254 --> 01:36:20,845
How are you gonna make that right?

1783
01:36:20,845 --> 01:36:23,001
You can't, that's impossible!

1784
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:26,334
I don't, ah, I-I can't even talk to you!

1785
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:29,722
And where do you think you're going?

1786
01:36:29,722 --> 01:36:31,758
- Oh, just get out of my way, Gregory.

1787
01:36:31,758 --> 01:36:32,889
It is over between us.

1788
01:36:32,889 --> 01:36:35,565
I am done, I am going to LA,

1789
01:36:35,565 --> 01:36:37,726
and I'm going to be with my,

1790
01:36:37,726 --> 01:36:39,276
I'm gonna be by myself.

1791
01:36:39,276 --> 01:36:41,488
- Are you going to tell Paul what you did?

1792
01:36:41,488 --> 01:36:43,927
How are you going to
make that right with him?

1793
01:36:43,927 --> 01:36:46,040
- [Tootsie] It is over between us.

1794
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,399
You fuckface!
(sharp smacking)

1795
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:51,149
(engine rumbles)

1796
01:36:52,123 --> 01:36:52,956
- What?

1797
01:36:53,902 --> 01:36:54,819
- $500,000?

1798
01:36:57,056 --> 01:36:59,323
- It was the most stupid
thing I've ever done.

1799
01:36:59,323 --> 01:37:00,588
Paul, I am so sorry.

1800
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:04,370
I-I-I, it was just a mistake,
I, oh, I don't know why.

1801
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:07,140
I was just being stupid.

1802
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:10,307
(slow rhythmic music)

1803
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:14,708
- We've all done stupid things, honey.

1804
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:18,813
My husband left me for a man.

1805
01:37:18,813 --> 01:37:20,563
My house burned down.

1806
01:37:21,702 --> 01:37:25,869
My dog was killed by a falling
tree struck by lightning,

1807
01:37:26,733 --> 01:37:30,233
and I'm legally blind, but I'm still here.

1808
01:37:32,905 --> 01:37:34,469
- You're legally blind?

1809
01:37:34,469 --> 01:37:35,302
- In 1974,

1810
01:37:36,552 --> 01:37:40,052
I used Mighty Glue to put on my eyelashes.

1811
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:45,926
I just got so tired of
putting them on every day.

1812
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:49,343
- Oh, that's why you wear the sunglasses.

1813
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:53,405
And you've been driving a car?

1814
01:37:53,405 --> 01:37:57,559
- [Piggy B] These are the original lashes.

1815
01:37:57,559 --> 01:37:58,559
Not bad, eh?

1816
01:38:02,644 --> 01:38:04,915
- [Tootsie] Um, well, they.

1817
01:38:04,915 --> 01:38:06,193
- No, yeah, they're um...

1818
01:38:06,193 --> 01:38:08,170
- They're fine, no, they're, they're good.

1819
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:09,153
- Pretty.
- They're good.

1820
01:38:09,153 --> 01:38:11,885
They look good, yeah, no,
they're nice, they're nice.

1821
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:12,885
- Thank you.

1822
01:38:13,826 --> 01:38:16,972
- Isn't there some kind of
procedure you could have?

1823
01:38:16,972 --> 01:38:19,889
- There is, but it takes big bucks,

1824
01:38:20,869 --> 01:38:24,202
and I'm fresh out of big bucks just now.

1825
01:38:27,429 --> 01:38:28,429
What's this?

1826
01:38:29,925 --> 01:38:31,957
- It's my winnings from the casino.

1827
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:33,399
The $5,000.

1828
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:36,313
Well, minus the 100 that
I gave to Lucy for a tip,

1829
01:38:36,313 --> 01:38:39,247
because, well, I think
she really needs it, but,

1830
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,747
B you can get your eyes fixed.

1831
01:38:43,361 --> 01:38:45,620
The beginning of making everything right.

1832
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,587
- Oh, come here, Miss Uptight Thing,

1833
01:38:47,587 --> 01:38:51,949
and give me a hug.
(chuckles)

1834
01:38:51,949 --> 01:38:55,282
(gentle rhythmic music)

1835
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:04,556
- I have a confession, too.

1836
01:39:04,556 --> 01:39:07,723
(slow rhythmic music)

1837
01:39:10,827 --> 01:39:12,160
'Til last night,

1838
01:39:13,778 --> 01:39:15,949
I was working for The Family.

1839
01:39:15,949 --> 01:39:19,116
(slow rhythmic music)

1840
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:26,419
I was just about to do
all these ad campaigns

1841
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:27,836
and email blasts,

1842
01:39:30,785 --> 01:39:33,702
but then I gave them a full refund.

1843
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:39,466
Even though now it means
that my business may go under

1844
01:39:39,466 --> 01:39:43,138
and any delusion that I have
of saving up my own money

1845
01:39:43,138 --> 01:39:46,971
for my own wedding is
no longer a possibility.

1846
01:39:48,772 --> 01:39:52,939
- Well, it looks like it's been
true confessions all around.

1847
01:39:54,183 --> 01:39:55,016
- B,

1848
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:58,393
that's your first love, right?

1849
01:39:58,393 --> 01:39:59,974
You always have that picture with you.

1850
01:39:59,974 --> 01:40:01,931
- He's some billionaire now.

1851
01:40:01,931 --> 01:40:03,399
Jonathan Tate.

1852
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:04,284
- [Tootsie] Wait, wait,

1853
01:40:04,284 --> 01:40:06,445
why does that name sound so familiar?

1854
01:40:06,445 --> 01:40:09,393
- He's the head of The Family.

1855
01:40:09,393 --> 01:40:11,590
- Who have you been meeting with?

1856
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:12,923
- Miss Anderson.

1857
01:40:14,494 --> 01:40:16,494
- Miss Deborah Anderson?

1858
01:40:26,227 --> 01:40:28,440
- I am so sorry, I, I
will make this right.

1859
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,056
I will, you have to believe me.

1860
01:40:30,056 --> 01:40:31,963
I will make this right.

1861
01:40:31,963 --> 01:40:33,372
(door thuds)

1862
01:40:33,372 --> 01:40:34,906
Honey, take my purse.

1863
01:40:34,906 --> 01:40:37,875
Um, listen, I need, um, I need a computer,

1864
01:40:37,875 --> 01:40:39,458
and I need a phone.

1865
01:40:40,412 --> 01:40:41,968
- Upstairs to the left.

1866
01:40:41,968 --> 01:40:43,218
- Okay, thanks.

1867
01:40:48,755 --> 01:40:50,349
(sighs)

1868
01:40:50,349 --> 01:40:52,849
(birds chirp)

1869
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,470
(chuckling)

1870
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:59,012
- [Tootsie] That Miss Piggy
B is something, isn't she?

1871
01:40:59,012 --> 01:41:00,509
(chuckles) Oh my god.

1872
01:41:00,509 --> 01:41:02,342
- [Paul] Yeah, she is.

1873
01:41:04,702 --> 01:41:06,542
- She really opened my eyes.

1874
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:09,625
(gentle piano music)

1875
01:41:12,767 --> 01:41:13,684
Last night,

1876
01:41:16,122 --> 01:41:16,955
I got it.

1877
01:41:20,749 --> 01:41:21,582
I got it.

1878
01:41:27,144 --> 01:41:28,227
I stood there

1879
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:34,806
and listened to that man who
calls himself a Christian

1880
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:37,842
tell the world

1881
01:41:39,258 --> 01:41:40,175
that my son

1882
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:44,710
is an abomination against God,

1883
01:41:47,257 --> 01:41:51,090
some kind of subhuman
because of who you love.

1884
01:41:54,297 --> 01:41:55,464
And I realized

1885
01:41:57,732 --> 01:41:58,565
that man

1886
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:02,360
is not a good man.

1887
01:42:04,214 --> 01:42:07,059
That man is not a Christian in my eyes.

1888
01:42:07,059 --> 01:42:10,142
(gentle piano music)

1889
01:42:15,214 --> 01:42:17,547
You and your amazing friends

1890
01:42:19,172 --> 01:42:20,376
have every right

1891
01:42:20,376 --> 01:42:24,376
to stand up before God
or whatever and shout out

1892
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:28,283
that you love another human being.

1893
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:37,400
I am so proud of you.

1894
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:40,483
(gentle piano music)

1895
01:42:42,481 --> 01:42:43,484
And.

1896
01:42:43,484 --> 01:42:46,567
(gentle piano music)

1897
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:53,767
- What's this?

1898
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,905
- Damage control.

1899
01:42:56,905 --> 01:42:59,988
(gentle piano music)

1900
01:43:04,465 --> 01:43:08,632
That should take care of
everything, shouldn't it?

1901
01:43:10,312 --> 01:43:11,497
- Mom, um.

1902
01:43:11,497 --> 01:43:14,580
(gentle piano music)

1903
01:43:20,765 --> 01:43:23,015
(knocking)

1904
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:26,923
Thank you.

1905
01:43:38,026 --> 01:43:38,859
Dad!

1906
01:43:40,052 --> 01:43:41,408
- Hello, son.

1907
01:43:41,408 --> 01:43:44,005
- [Tootsie] Jesus Christ,
what the heck happened to you?

1908
01:43:44,005 --> 01:43:46,747
- It's, uh, it's a long story.

1909
01:43:46,747 --> 01:43:49,080
(chuckling)

1910
01:43:50,136 --> 01:43:51,612
There, there, Tootsie.

1911
01:43:51,612 --> 01:43:53,651
- [Tootsie] Sorry, I'm so sorry.

1912
01:43:53,651 --> 01:43:55,351
- That's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

1913
01:43:55,351 --> 01:43:57,398
But I've made it all
right, I have, haven't I?

1914
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,094
I've made it all right.
- Yeah.

1915
01:43:59,094 --> 01:44:01,435
Everything's, everything's just fine now.

1916
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:05,529
- Good, good, I'm glad you worked it out.

1917
01:44:05,529 --> 01:44:07,529
- Oh, Paul.
- Good, good.

1918
01:44:08,603 --> 01:44:10,917
I'm so glad you're okay.

1919
01:44:10,917 --> 01:44:12,027
- I'm so glad you're okay.

1920
01:44:12,027 --> 01:44:13,535
Where have you been?
(phone rings)

1921
01:44:13,535 --> 01:44:16,635
- About two days behind
you the entire time.

1922
01:44:16,635 --> 01:44:18,443
I must smell like a muskrat.

1923
01:44:18,443 --> 01:44:21,110
- You do.
- Come here, come here.

1924
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:23,147
- Hello?

1925
01:44:23,147 --> 01:44:25,264
- [Woman] Hello, Paul?

1926
01:44:25,264 --> 01:44:26,744
- Yes, this is Paul.

1927
01:44:26,744 --> 01:44:30,013
- [Woman] Oh, my name is
Sue Chen, and you called...

1928
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:32,180
- What?
- Leaving messages.

1929
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:34,947
- Messages?

1930
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:37,837
Um.

1931
01:44:39,009 --> 01:44:39,842
Oh.

1932
01:44:47,444 --> 01:44:49,635
- For heaven sakes, Gregory,
have you seen my purse?

1933
01:44:49,635 --> 01:44:51,156
- Did you look in the bedroom?

1934
01:44:51,156 --> 01:44:52,574
- [Paul] I can't find my shirt?

1935
01:44:52,574 --> 01:44:53,925
Has anybody seen my shirt?

1936
01:44:53,925 --> 01:44:55,020
- Downstairs in the laundry.

1937
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,996
- I swear, I don't know what I'm doing.

1938
01:44:56,996 --> 01:44:58,372
- [Paul] I'm missing my keys.

1939
01:44:58,372 --> 01:44:59,517
Dad, have you seen my keys?

1940
01:44:59,517 --> 01:45:01,475
- I think they're in the bathroom.

1941
01:45:01,475 --> 01:45:02,683
- Wait, wait, wait,

1942
01:45:02,683 --> 01:45:04,197
- [Newscaster] The CEO of
The Family, Deborah Anderson

1943
01:45:04,197 --> 01:45:05,363
- Look at this.
- What?

1944
01:45:05,363 --> 01:45:07,129
- [Newscaster] Is rumored to be inside.

1945
01:45:07,129 --> 01:45:09,154
The legendary Miss Piggy
B will be leading us in...

1946
01:45:09,154 --> 01:45:10,112
- Oh my god, Greg, look at this.

1947
01:45:10,112 --> 01:45:11,259
- [Newscaster] to share
a startling revelation.

1948
01:45:11,259 --> 01:45:13,017
- Who is that?
- Miss Piggy B.

1949
01:45:13,017 --> 01:45:14,598
- Good evening, Lance.

1950
01:45:14,598 --> 01:45:17,205
One I knew Miss Tate
started going after my gays,

1951
01:45:17,205 --> 01:45:19,680
I knew it was time for me
to do something about it.

1952
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,047
- Oh, that's fantastic.

1953
01:45:21,047 --> 01:45:22,471
- Well, that's a terrible wig.

1954
01:45:22,471 --> 01:45:24,497
(chuckles)

1955
01:45:24,497 --> 01:45:25,830
- Come on, boys.

1956
01:45:28,336 --> 01:45:30,253
- Miss Piggy B, ah, ah!

1957
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:34,062
- [Piggy B] Miss Jonathan Tate.

1958
01:45:34,062 --> 01:45:35,020
(gasps)

1959
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:38,097
- [Lance] A startling
revelation, more soon.

1960
01:45:38,097 --> 01:45:40,430
(chuckling)

1961
01:45:42,359 --> 01:45:45,609
(rhythmic Asian music)

1962
01:45:46,748 --> 01:45:48,218
- [Sue] Paul!

1963
01:45:48,218 --> 01:45:49,051
Paul!

1964
01:45:50,613 --> 01:45:52,113
Honey, come quick.

1965
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:55,466
Paul is here in our restaurant.

1966
01:45:55,466 --> 01:45:58,716
(rhythmic Asian music)

1967
01:46:22,647 --> 01:46:26,480
(rhythmic instrumental music)

1968
01:46:38,413 --> 01:46:42,625
♫ I'm headin' out to hang with the girls

1969
01:46:42,625 --> 01:46:46,883
♫ Sprayin' Aqua Net on the girls

1970
01:46:46,883 --> 01:46:48,859
♫ I'm gonna stir up

1971
01:46:48,859 --> 01:46:51,185
♫ Some trouble tonight
- Do you take Paul,

1972
01:46:51,185 --> 01:46:53,352
trust and love each other?

1973
01:46:56,283 --> 01:46:57,366
- [Jim] I do.

1974
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:01,797
- [Christina] Do you Paul take Jim

1975
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:04,547
to honor and trust and grow with?

1976
01:47:08,693 --> 01:47:09,860
- [Paul] I do.

1977
01:47:12,005 --> 01:47:15,495
- By the power vested in me
by the state of California,

1978
01:47:15,495 --> 01:47:17,078
I now pronounce you

1979
01:47:18,016 --> 01:47:19,354
married.

1980
01:47:19,354 --> 01:47:23,521
(cheering)
(clapping)

1981
01:47:27,529 --> 01:47:29,779
(cheering)

1982
01:47:30,874 --> 01:47:32,374
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

1983
01:47:33,608 --> 01:47:35,275
- Kiss, kiss!
- Kiss!

1984
01:47:36,689 --> 01:47:40,826
(cheering)
(clapping)

1985
01:47:40,826 --> 01:47:43,993
(ragtime piano music)

1986
01:47:45,551 --> 01:47:47,759
- When I was a child,

1987
01:47:47,759 --> 01:47:51,717
my family took a drive up to the country.

1988
01:47:51,717 --> 01:47:53,889
We made a stop at a little gas station

1989
01:47:53,889 --> 01:47:56,363
in the middle of nowhere.

1990
01:47:56,363 --> 01:47:59,170
And when I came back to the car

1991
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:02,996
I realized they had driven off without me

1992
01:48:02,996 --> 01:48:04,329
and I was alone.

1993
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:07,268
I thought that I would be spending

1994
01:48:07,268 --> 01:48:09,537
the rest of my life there,

1995
01:48:09,537 --> 01:48:12,204
pumping gas, and I'd ask myself,

1996
01:48:14,045 --> 01:48:14,962
is that it?

1997
01:48:16,878 --> 01:48:18,378
Is that all I get?

1998
01:48:20,673 --> 01:48:23,090
♫ Is that it

1999
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:29,070
♫ Is that all I get

2000
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:33,470
♫ I want more

2001
01:48:35,621 --> 01:48:38,538
♫ More than before

2002
01:48:40,138 --> 01:48:42,633
♫ If that's it

2003
01:48:42,633 --> 01:48:45,322
♫ If that's all I get

2004
01:48:45,322 --> 01:48:49,072
♫ Then baby I mustn't forget

2005
01:48:50,074 --> 01:48:52,253
♫ That I gotta go

2006
01:48:52,253 --> 01:48:55,762
♫ Get on with the show and

2007
01:48:55,762 --> 01:48:58,512
♫ Get on with it

2008
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:03,457
And when I was 22, the world was mine.

2009
01:49:04,647 --> 01:49:08,480
Success, life and love
were all coming my way.

2010
01:49:10,429 --> 01:49:14,862
And then my young heart got
broken into a million pieces

2011
01:49:14,862 --> 01:49:18,309
and I knew I would never be the same,

2012
01:49:18,309 --> 01:49:20,343
I cried for a week.

2013
01:49:20,343 --> 01:49:23,146
And when my tears finally dried

2014
01:49:23,146 --> 01:49:24,396
I asked myself,

2015
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:26,310
Is that it?

2016
01:49:27,696 --> 01:49:29,196
Is that all I get?

2017
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:34,232
♫ Is that it

2018
01:49:36,746 --> 01:49:39,746
♫ Is that all I get

2019
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:44,111
♫ I want more

2020
01:49:45,921 --> 01:49:48,838
♫ More than before

2021
01:49:50,446 --> 01:49:52,791
♫ If that's it

2022
01:49:52,791 --> 01:49:55,471
♫ If that's all I get

2023
01:49:55,471 --> 01:49:59,857
♫ Then baby I mustn't forget

2024
01:49:59,857 --> 01:50:02,037
♫ That I gotta go

2025
01:50:02,037 --> 01:50:05,357
♫ Get on with the show and

2026
01:50:05,357 --> 01:50:08,107
♫ Get on with it

2027
01:50:10,509 --> 01:50:12,842
And when I was 36 years old,

2028
01:50:13,967 --> 01:50:16,217
I thought my life was over.

2029
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:20,269
Life hadn't gone the way that I planned

2030
01:50:20,269 --> 01:50:23,005
and I thought I was through.

2031
01:50:23,005 --> 01:50:26,951
After years of trying to
make something of myself

2032
01:50:26,951 --> 01:50:28,284
I had to wonder,

2033
01:50:29,827 --> 01:50:30,744
Is that it?

2034
01:50:32,364 --> 01:50:33,864
Is that all I get?

2035
01:50:35,726 --> 01:50:38,143
♫ Is that it

2036
01:50:40,972 --> 01:50:43,972
♫ Is that all I get

2037
01:50:45,565 --> 01:50:48,065
♫ I want more

2038
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:52,686
♫ More than before

2039
01:50:54,141 --> 01:50:56,203
♫ If that's it

2040
01:50:56,203 --> 01:50:58,915
♫ If that's all I get

2041
01:50:58,915 --> 01:51:03,639
♫ Then, baby, I mustn't forget

2042
01:51:03,639 --> 01:51:05,948
♫ That I gotta go

2043
01:51:05,948 --> 01:51:09,852
♫ Get on with the show and

2044
01:51:09,852 --> 01:51:12,602
♫ Get on with it

2045
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:17,917
♫ I gotta go

2046
01:51:20,107 --> 01:51:23,357
♫ Get on with the show

2047
01:51:24,936 --> 01:51:26,769
♫ And

2048
01:51:27,657 --> 01:51:30,407
♫ Get on with it

2049
01:51:35,597 --> 01:51:39,764
(applause)
(cheering)
