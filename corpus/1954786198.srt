She is a remarkable woman, Jim. Remarkable.

507
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,380
But when you told me to look after her,

508
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,216
you didn't actually expect her to wait
for a man who walked away?

509
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,510
She's my wife,

510
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:09,844
and she will remain so.

00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:13,682

in this fairy tale, but then why would I...

Do we need a lawyer,
or should I start talking?
