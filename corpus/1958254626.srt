<b>I don't know.</b>

182
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,160
<b>I don't know what I would do with you.</b>

183
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,439
<b>Nice drapes, Martha.</b>

184
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,959
<b>You look fabulous.</b>

185
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,120
<b>You won't be single for long, honey.</b>

186
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,240
<b>No, what, you're not hair stylish,</b>

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
<b>you're not a manicurist, right?</b>

<b>You're nothing to--</b>

00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,759
<b>What are you?</b>

00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,159
<b>Guess I'm someone who knew that streaks</b>

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,039
<b>are pretty much finished in the '90s.</b>

192
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,840
<b>Thank you.</b>

193
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,519
<b>Oh, hey, streaks are not--</b>

<b>[phone ringing]</b>

<b>I think we should show</b>

<b>it the week of the 10th,</b>

197
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,600
<b>and let's book the inspection.</b>

198
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,679
<b>When can we get, what, the 15th?</b>

199
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,960
<b>Yes, I'd like to have all that done.</b>

200
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,720
<b>OK.</b>

201
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,639
<b>Terrific.</b>

202
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,639
<b>Thanks.</b>

203
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,840
<b>Can I help you?</b>

204
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,720
<b>Or do you just want</b>

205
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
<b>to stand there all day?</b>

206
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,320
<b>I was thinking about</b>

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,759
<b>standing here all day.</b>

208
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,679
<b>Sit yourself.</b>

209
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,519
<b>Want to know why?</b>

210
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,200
<b>Sure.</b>

211
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,720
<b>Not the hell.</b>

212
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,559
<b>It's a little slow.</b>

213
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,879
<b>I got time.</b>

214
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,600
<b>Because if you're a</b>

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,440
<b>woman rapidly approaching 40,</b>

216
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
<b>and you've made the</b>

217
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,960
<b>unbelievably stupid mistake</b>

218
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
<b>of thinking that trying to</b>

219
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,919
<b>raise a family was a good thing,</b>

220
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,960
<b>all you ever wanted to do</b>

221
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,720
<b>was be a wife and a mother,</b>

222
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,039
<b>and your children grow up, and they can't</b>

223
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,879
<b>wait to get away from you, and your</b>

224
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,879
<b>marriage is falling apart,</b>

225
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,720
<b>so you try to start over</b>

226
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,159
<b>with no skills whatsoever.</b>

227
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,759
<b>And all you hear is that</b>

228
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,399
<b>damn song all by myself,</b>

229
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
<b>then you would just stand here, too.</b>

230
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,759
<b>You're right.</b>

231
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,039
<b>That song's irritating.</b>

232
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,159
<b>You want to come in for a cup of coffee?</b>

233
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:30,840
<b>OK.</b>

234
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,399
<b>Brad, Mack, this is--</b>

235
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,360
<b>what's your name?</b>

236
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,000
<b>I'm Kate, Kate Mayer.</b>

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,399
<b>Hey, Kate, I'm Maggie.</b>

238
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,600
<b>Hi, Maggie.</b>

239
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,039
<b>Which one's Brad and which one's Mack?</b>

240
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,600
<b>Hi, I'm Brad.</b>

241
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,279
<b>I'm just kidding.</b>

242
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
<b>I'm McNally, Mack for short.</b>

243
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
<b>And this is Brad, just Brad.</b>

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
<b>Kate's having a really bad day.</b>

245
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,000
<b>She doesn't know</b>

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
<b>whether to go left or right,</b>

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,960
<b>so I invited her in for a cup of Choke.</b>

248
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,039
<b>Great.</b>

249
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,919
<b>Let me get that.</b>

250
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,440
<b>Cream, sugar, black, please.</b>

251
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
<b>OK.</b>

252
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,840
<b>Hey, why don't you come take a load off?</b>

253
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,960
<b>Brad?</b>

254
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
<b>She won't buy.</b>

255
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,960
<b>Take a break.</b>

256
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,679
<b>Here you go.</b>

257
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,440
<b>Thank you.</b>

258
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,399
<b>I'm sorry about all this.</b>

259
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
<b>I was just having a moment out there,</b>

260
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,679
<b>and Maggie here took pity on me.</b>

261
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,879
<b>No, it's fine, really.</b>

262
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,159
<b>No explanation needed.</b>

263
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,600
<b>Look at who I have working for me.</b>

264
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,759
<b>If I didn't hate you</b>

265
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,480
<b>already, I'd take offense to that.</b>

266
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,759
<b>See what I mean?</b>

267
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,720
<b>You don't really need a receptionist.</b>

268
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,279
<b>You're not just offering me this job</b>

269
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,519
<b>because you feel sorry for me.</b>

270
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,600
<b>Assume to be separated, mother of two.</b>

271
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,840
<b>No, I really need a receptionist.</b>

272
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,960
<b>Maggie and I are out all the time,</b>

273
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
<b>and Brad doesn't like</b>

274
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,960
<b>to answer the phone, so--</b>

275
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
<b>Does he ever talk?</b>

276
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,559
<b>You know, it's not</b>

277
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,399
<b>really a people person.</b>

278
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,840
<b>He's brilliant, just not a people person.</b>

279
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,879
<b>Kind of a bad job for him</b>

280
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,039
<b>to happen, don't you think?</b>

281
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,879
<b>Yeah, he's working on it.</b>

282
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,000
<b>OK, so when do you want me to start?</b>

283
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,279
<b>Well, when's good for you?</b>

284
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,720
<b>How's tomorrow? - Great.</b>

285
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,320
<b>OK.</b>

286
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,840
<b>That's terrific.</b>

287
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,440
<b>Thank you.</b>

288
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,360
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

289
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,600
<b>You're welcome.</b>

290
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,279
<b>We'll see you tomorrow.</b>

291
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,320
<b>Yeah, terrific.</b>

292
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,720
<b>Bye.</b>

293
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,200
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

294
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,519
<b>So you hired him?</b>

295
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,759
<b>Yeah.</b>

296
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,440
<b>She's cute.</b>

297
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:21,879
<b>Oh, shut up.</b>

298
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,120
<b>Hi.</b>

299
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
<b>Hi.</b>

300
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
<b>How was your day?</b>

301
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,399
<b>Good.</b>

302
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,320
<b>Good.</b>

303
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,639
<b>I got a job.</b>

304
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,840
<b>Good.</b>

305
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,120
<b>Repeat back to me what I just said.</b>

306
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,000
<b>You-- you said you had a</b>

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,879
<b>good day and you did the usual.</b>

308
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,879
<b>You don't do that in court, do you?</b>

309
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,360
<b>Do what?</b>

310
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,039
<b>Makeup stuff.</b>

311
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,240
<b>No, I don't make up stuff.</b>

312
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,120
<b>I just said I got a job.</b>

313
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,559
<b>How you got the usual out of that?</b>

314
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,279
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

315
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:47,639
<b>Wait a second.</b>

316
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,799
<b>You got a job?</b>

317
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,759
<b>What kind of job?</b>

318
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,519
<b>I'm going to be a</b>

319
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,159
<b>receptionist at a real estate office.</b>

320
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,440
<b>A receptionist?</b>

321
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,879
<b>That'll barely cover sitter costs.</b>

322
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,200
<b>What is the point of that?</b>

323
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,120
<b>I mean, come on, Kate.</b>

324
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,399
<b>Isn't that kind of</b>

325
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,080
<b>silly and counterproductive?</b>

326
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,399
<b>Maybe it is, but you got</b>

327
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:14,720
<b>to start somewhere, Jack.</b>

328
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,399
<b>Bye.</b>

329
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,960
<b>Good morning.</b>

330
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,919
<b>Va-Va-Voom.</b>

331
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,279
<b>Keep your hands off of her, Mac.</b>

332
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,440
<b>I'm gay.</b>

333
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,159
<b>Maggie thinks it's</b>

334
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,120
<b>hysterically funny to make</b>

335
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,279
<b>little homophobic jokes about it.</b>

336
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:28,720
<b>You're gay?</b>

337
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,679
<b>Yeah, but don't</b>

338
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,159
<b>worry, it's not contagious.</b>

339
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,799
<b>I bet she's never met a gay person</b>

340
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,639
<b>ever less than personal.</b>

341
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,840
<b>How is that possible in 2002?</b>

342
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,440
<b>No, no, no.</b>

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,559
<b>I've met a few.</b>

344
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,279
<b>It's just they don't</b>

345
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,960
<b>usually look like you, do they?</b>

346
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,039
<b>I've got a plaid shirt I could slip into.</b>

347
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,840
<b>I tried it once.</b>

348
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,879
<b>Wasn't my cup of tea.</b>

349
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,720
<b>I don't know who really asked you.</b>

350
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,399
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

351
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,679
<b>But if this bothers you--</b>

352
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,320
<b>No, no.</b>

353
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,000
<b>Actually, I think it</b>

354
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,039
<b>probably makes you more interesting</b>

355
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,720
<b>than I thought you were.</b>

356
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
<b>Really?</b>

357
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,000
<b>I didn't mean that.</b>

358
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,360
<b>What I meant to say was, I think people</b>

359
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,600
<b>should be able to be whoever they are.</b>

360
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,320
<b>This is your desk.</b>

361
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,399
<b>We set it up for you.</b>

362
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,320
<b>So there you go.</b>

363
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,960
<b>Thank you.</b>

364
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,000
<b>You just answer the phones, haze realty,</b>

365
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,759
<b>you know, transfer calls, take messages.</b>

366
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,960
<b>That's it?</b>

367
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
<b>And that's it.</b>

368
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,879
<b>It's kind of like</b>

369
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,200
<b>stealing money, isn't it?</b>

370
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,279
<b>It is kind of.</b>

371
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,120
<b>You know, I think the point to this job</b>

372
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,320
<b>is to have some fun.</b>

373
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,639
<b>Because most of us here haven't had much.</b>

374
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,360
<b>We are the walking wounded.</b>

375
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,039
<b>I am not the walking wounded.</b>

376
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,720
<b>Yes, you are.</b>

377
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,279
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

378
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:26,879
<b>Yes, you are.</b>

379
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,759
<b>I don't know why I</b>

380
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,879
<b>put up with this abuse.</b>

381
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,840
<b>How'd you love us?</b>

382
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,399
<b>No, I don't.</b>

383
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,879
<b>Yes, you did.</b>

384
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,600
<b>No, I don't.</b>

385
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,720
<b>See, it's not really like stealing money.</b>

386
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,679
<b>Thanks, you guys.</b>

387
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,639
<b>You're making my reentry painless.</b>

388
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,679
<b>Our pleasure.</b>

389
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,320
<b>If you want to see your</b>

390
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,600
<b>kids, then we'll lock up.</b>

391
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,080
<b>OK.</b>

392
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,960
<b>Good night.</b>

393
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
<b>Night.</b>

394
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
<b>Have a good one.</b>

395
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,000
<b>You too.</b>

396
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
<b>You like her.</b>

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,879
<b>I can tell.</b>

398
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,639
<b>Will you stop trying to set</b>

399
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,320
<b>me up with every woman that</b>

400
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,080
<b>walks through that damn door?</b>

401
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,679
<b>You know what?</b>

402
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,039
<b>You're an idiot.</b>

403
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,840
<b>Because you believe if a person is gay,</b>

404
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,720
<b>that they like all</b>

405
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,279
<b>people of the same sex.</b>

406
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,000
<b>That we are</b>

407
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,480
<b>indiscriminate, shark-like creatures who</b>

408
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,840
<b>never sleep or are just</b>

409
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,159
<b>looking for our next victim.</b>

410
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,840
<b>Well, guess what?</b>

411
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,679
<b>Some of us actually do discriminate</b>

412
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,720
<b>and don't want to sleep with</b>

413
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,399
<b>every woman who ever lived.</b>

414
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,639
<b>Which, by the way, if that were true,</b>

415
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,840
<b>would include our mothers.</b>

416
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,759
<b>And yes, I like her.</b>

417
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,279
<b>News flash, I like you too.</b>

418
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,399
<b>Doesn't mean I want to</b>

419
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,679
<b>sleep with you either.</b>

420
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,480
<b>Got it?</b>

421
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,080
<b>Got it.</b>

422
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,960
<b>Good.</b>

423
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,799
<b>Let's go, guys.</b>

424
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,679
<b>Should I forward calls to yourself?</b>

425
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,679
<b>No, you won't be able to.</b>

426
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,360
<b>Are you going to be out of rage?</b>

427
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,080
<b>No, you will be.</b>

428
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,519
<b>You're going to put us on the caravan.</b>

429
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,720
<b>It's a caravan.</b>

430
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,840
<b>Jeez, have you read any</b>

431
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,279
<b>magazines, a book, anything?</b>

432
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,399
<b>A caravan's where all the</b>

433
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:45,960
<b>brokers go on to see all the new</b>

434
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,080
<b>houses that are on the market.</b>

435
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,399
<b>Hey, isn't Brad coming?</b>

436
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,120
<b>You know, he doesn't like the caravans.</b>

437
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
<b>Well, why does he come on you?</b>

438
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,519
<b>For sure.</b>

439
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,519
<b>Ready?</b>

440
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,200
<b>I know it's one of my</b>

441
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
<b>business, but it seems like Brad's</b>

442
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,240
<b>not very good at his job.</b>

443
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,960
<b>That is correct.</b>

444
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,000
<b>Why does it Mac fire him?</b>

445
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,960
<b>You didn't hear this from me, but Brad</b>

446
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,120
<b>used to be a computer</b>

447
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,360
<b>geek at a dot com.</b>

448
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,320
<b>It went under, and Mac brought him here.</b>

449
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,840
<b>Besides, Mac could never fire anyone.</b>

450
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,679
<b>It's loyalty to the</b>

451
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,200
<b>point of absurdity, isn't it?</b>

452
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,159
<b>Yeah.</b>

453
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,559
<b>This is the part you</b>

454
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,559
<b>really didn't hear from me.</b>

455
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:49,159
<b>He's her ex-lover's brother.</b>

456
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,879
<b>Well, why doesn't she help him?</b>

457
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,039
<b>That'd be hard.</b>

458
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,399
<b>She's dead.</b>

459
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,559
<b>Yuck.</b>

460
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,400
<b>Maggie.</b>

461
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,920
<b>Sorry.</b>

462
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,799
<b>I think it has potential.</b>

463
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,160
<b>You think everything has potential.</b>

464
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,599
<b>Sorry, she scraped off those crud.</b>

465
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,000
<b>She's too.</b>

466
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,960
<b>She got the new light.</b>

467
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,599
<b>She should get the premade ready to hang</b>

468
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,160
<b>cabinets, get a whole</b>

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,279
<b>new line of the cheap</b>

<b>He did white white, and</b>

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,039
<b>it's a gay man's dream.</b>

473
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,319
<b>What?</b>

474
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,839
<b>Am I right?</b>

<b>Hey, it's realty.</b>

478
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,680
<b>May I ask who's calling, please?</b>

479
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,359
<b>Just one moment.</b>

480
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,519
<b>It's a Mr. Brubaker.</b>

481
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,400
<b>Hello, Mr. Brubaker.</b>

482
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,119
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

483
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,279
<b>Great.</b>

484
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,519
<b>When can I bring over the paperwork?</b>

485
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:13,839
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

486
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,839
<b>No, tomorrow morning's fine.</b>

487
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,279
<b>OK.</b>

488
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,920
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

489
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,400
<b>Yeah?</b>

490
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,559
<b>Yeah.</b>

491
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,279
<b>You have a tradition here.</b>

492
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,799
<b>Any time a house is sold, we</b>

493
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,759
<b>go out and celebrate my treat.</b>

494
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,680
<b>Girl, I'll be light and drunk.</b>

495
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,279
<b>OK.</b>

496
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,839
<b>You want to come?</b>

<b>Sure.</b>

498
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,400
<b>I'll ask Jack to stay with the kids.</b>

<b>You know, I have a suggestion.</b>

500
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,759
<b>Let's just tell him you</b>

<b>have a business meeting.</b>

502

<b>I think about the</b>

<b>drinking and drunk part.</b>

504
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,799
<b>OK.</b>

505
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,319
<b>Call him from the car.</b>

<b>Come on.</b>

507
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,039
<b>Come on.</b>

508
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:38,440
<b>OK.</b>

<b>[music playing]</b>

<b>Hey, JJ.</b>

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,519
<b>Hey, hey, guys.</b>

513
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:44,960
<b>How you doing?</b>

514
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,640
<b>All right.</b>

515
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,680
<b>Now, was he a purchase</b>

516
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,559
<b>price, a selling price?</b>

517
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,319
<b>You bet.</b>

518
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:48,920
<b>All right.</b>

519
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,559
<b>My round.</b>

520
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,400
<b>OK.</b>

521
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,680
<b>OK.</b>

522
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,400
<b>[laughter]</b>

523
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,559
<b>And so this guy says, does the carpet</b>

<b>come with the house?</b>

525
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,160
<b>And I say, it's wall to wall.</b>

526
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,519
<b>What do you think?</b>

527
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,000
<b>And then he says, I don't know.</b>

528
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,599
<b>And then I said, you're</b>

529
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,599
<b>going to make this more on it</b>

530

<b>than I've ever met.</b>

531
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,480
<b>And then I said--</b>

532
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,319
<b>It's like a damn</b>

533
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,319
<b>miniseries with no end to it.</b>

534
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,400
<b>Not unlike South Pacific, nice scenery,</b>

535
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,799
<b>no real point to it.</b>

536
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,039
<b>What?</b>

537
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,599
<b>Now you speak.</b>

538
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,880
<b>By the way, it wasn't a miniseries.</b>

539
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,160
<b>It was a play, then a movie,</b>

540
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,920
<b>then a badly miscast TV movie.</b>

541
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,640
<b>By the way, I hate you.</b>

542
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,359
<b>[laughter]</b>

543
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,920
<b>I think it's time for another round.</b>

544
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,960
<b>Yeah, Brad, you're buying.</b>

545
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,559
<b>What?</b>

546
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,559
<b>Mac always pays.</b>

547
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,559
<b>Yeah, well, her money is your money.</b>

548
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,799
<b>So what difference does it make?</b>

549
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,599
<b>Hey, what's it like being gay?</b>

550
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,559
<b>Well, you don't beat</b>

551
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,359
<b>around the bush, do you?</b>

552
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,200
<b>No.</b>

553
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
<b>I don't know.</b>

554
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,799
<b>What's it like having blue eyes?</b>

555
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,519
<b>You know, I think I</b>

556
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,519
<b>must be a little bit drunk,</b>

557
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,640
<b>because maybe that was an</b>

558
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,440
<b>incredibly stupid question</b>

559
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,160
<b>to ask you.</b>

560
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,720
<b>Oh, that's OK.</b>

561
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,319
<b>I think gay is kind of like</b>

562
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,960
<b>being part of a freak show.</b>

563
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,680
<b>You know, people like to</b>

564
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,119
<b>stop by the cage and stare.</b>

565
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,920
<b>I think what I meant</b>

566
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,720
<b>was, when did you first</b>

567
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
<b>know that you were attracted to women?</b>

568
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,720
<b>Like, when did you</b>

569
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,240
<b>decide, that's it, I'm gay?</b>

570
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,079
<b>It's not really a decision.</b>

571
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,799
<b>And I think I've always known.</b>

572
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,160
<b>Must be hard.</b>

573
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
<b>Is it hard?</b>

574
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,319
<b>Well, you get to</b>

575
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,559
<b>disappoint a lot of people,</b>

576
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,720
<b>starting with your parents.</b>

577
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,160
<b>Oh my god, my mother, who</b>

578
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,799
<b>is the most judgmental person</b>

579
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,599
<b>alive, would have a field day with that.</b>

580
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,960
<b>Mom, not only have I disappointed you</b>

581
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,559
<b>as a daughter, a wife, a</b>

582
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,480
<b>mother, and a homemaker,</b>

583
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,319
<b>but I've decided to sleep with women.</b>

584
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,279
<b>I ought to say it just to piss her off.</b>

585
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:19,279
<b>Yeah, that'd probably do it.</b>

586
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,559
<b>Honey, I'm home.</b>

587
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,839
<b>Hey, Bob.</b>

588
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,759
<b>Hey, you've got a good one.</b>

589
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,279
<b>Hey, you've got a good one.</b>

590
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,519
<b>Come on.</b>

591
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,160
<b>Let's go. Come on.</b>

592
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,519
<b>Let's go.</b>

593
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,799
<b>So this is just to show you</b>

594
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,640
<b>what we deal with, you know?</b>

595
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,559
<b>But don't be daunted by this couple.</b>

596
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,200
<b>They've interviewed</b>

597
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,160
<b>every real little tale, OK?</b>

598
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,440
<b>Well, we haven't been happy</b>

599
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,920
<b>about what any of you people</b>

600
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,279
<b>have said in terms of your commissions.</b>

601
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,039
<b>We're too high.</b>

602
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,160
<b>It's as simple as that.</b>

603
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,519
<b>Well, the normal commission is 6%,</b>

604
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,400
<b>so what were the other agents asking for?</b>

605
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,480
<b>3%. Uh-huh. 3%.</b>

606
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,839
<b>Well, I'm new, but it seems</b>

607
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,039
<b>to me that at either of those</b>

608
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,079
<b>numbers, you're going to get an agent</b>

609
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,920
<b>who's not going to work</b>

610
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,400
<b>very hard at selling your house, and you</b>

611
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
<b>want to move to Florida</b>

612
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,319
<b>sooner rather than later, am I right?</b>

613
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,279
<b>Also, I noticed some</b>

614
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,400
<b>problems with your foundation,</b>

615
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,279
<b>not to mention the fact</b>

616
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,519
<b>that Mac here is the best agent</b>

617
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,839
<b>in town, which means you'll get a higher</b>

618
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,519
<b>price for your house,</b>

619
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,240
<b>making lower commission</b>

620
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,319
<b>a moot point, am I right?</b>

621
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:29,680
<b>[music playing]</b>

622
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,920
<b>Problems with your foundation.</b>

623
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,279
<b>Where'd you come up with that?</b>

00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,319
<b>I'm Vila.</b>

625
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:42,119
<b>Oh, you are something.</b>

626
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,400
<b>What?</b>

627
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,519
<b>You'd make a great agent.</b>

628
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,039
<b>You should think about</b>

629
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,160
<b>getting your license.</b>

630
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,440
<b>What?</b>

631
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,200
<b>Your real estate license.</b>

632
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,839
<b>We don't help you.</b>

633
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,720
<b>So I don't know what to say.</b>

634
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,559
<b>Say yes.</b>

635
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:54,440
<b>I don't know.</b>

636
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,799
<b>All right.</b>

637
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,519
<b>Say you'll think about it.</b>

638
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,559
<b>OK.</b>

639
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,319
<b>Don't think about it.</b>

640
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,599
<b>Good.</b>

641
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,559
<b>This is good.</b>

642
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,799
<b>This is really good.</b>

<b>[inaudible]</b>

644
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,440
<b>It's interesting.</b>

645
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
<b>Did you hear the question?</b>

646
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
<b>I think you're right.</b>

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,720
<b>[inaudible]</b>

648
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,519
<b>[inaudible]</b>

649
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:16,680
<b>OK.</b>

<b>Now, when an inspection</b>

<b>goes wrong, what do you do?</b>

659
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,839
<b>Well, the contract all inspectors use</b>

660
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,519
<b>holds them harmless reliability.</b>

661
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,799
<b>Therefore, you don't have to do anything.</b>

662
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,839
<b>Excellent.</b>

663
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,960

<b>Why?</b>

<b>What are you doing differently?</b>

<b>Jack and I are separating.</b>

690

<b>Oh my god.</b>

691
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,440
<b>You can't be serious.</b>

<b>We're not happy, and we</b>

<b>Well, nobody's happy.</b>

695
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,839
<b>What has that got to do with anything?</b>

696
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,759
<b>Kind of everything.</b>

697
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:43,799
<b>What about you and the cuttings?</b>

698
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,559
<b>There's hours away.</b>

<b>Guys, I got to tell you something.</b>

700

<b>Yeah?</b>

701
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,880
<b>Kate and I are splitting up.</b>

702
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,839
<b>You are the perfect couple.</b>

703

<b>Now looks are deceiving.</b>

704
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,440
<b>This is going to change our whole lives.</b>

705
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,599
<b>Sandy's not about you.</b>

706
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,359
<b>It's about us.</b>

<b>I love you guys.</b>

<b>I hope you don't take sides,</b>

<b>I don't get it.</b>

711

<b>What happened?</b>

712
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,519
<b>Just out of the blue of</b>

<b>at the same time to separate?</b>

715
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,400
<b>Poof.</b>

716
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,160
<b>I think Jack would</b>

<b>have been fine with things</b>

<b>staying the way they were.</b>

719
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:29,839
<b>I asked for the separation.</b>

720
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,039
<b>You OK?</b>

721
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,519
<b>Yeah, I'm fine.</b>

<b>Yeah, well, I'll put</b>

<b>Are you sure you're the one that should</b>

<b>What's wrong?</b>

733
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,599
<b>Are the kids all right?</b>

734
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,640
<b>They're fine.</b>

<b>So I can take you to</b>

<b>see your new apartment.</b>

739
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,119
<b>And then we're going to tell the kids.</b>

<b>Mom, Dad, what?</b>

756
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,559
<b>Well, this is going to be</b>

758
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:06,200
<b>One minute, OK?</b>

759
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,759

<b>Yeah?</b>

764
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,000
<b>Well, the problem is that we</b>

<b>don't love each other enough.</b>

766
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:31,920
<b>We're going to separate.</b>

00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,039
<b>Yeah.</b>

769
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,039
<b>I've known for a long</b>

<b>You both mean the world to us.</b>

776
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,440
<b>This is the last thing we wanted to do.</b>

777
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,200
<b>All I know is I want my</b>

<b>I don't understand.</b>

<b>What happened?</b>

785
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,880
<b>I don't know.</b>

786
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,039
<b>Why do people forget why they loved</b>

<b>each other in the first place?</b>

788
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,680
<b>Because even though we try to do the best</b>

<b>we can, we're human.</b>

790
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,759
<b>And sometimes we get stuck.</b>

791
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,079
<b>I just can't move.</b>

792
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:37,640

<b>Maggie opened it.</b>

<b>Yeah, I don't get too excited.</b>

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,400
<b>I haven't seen it yet.</b>

<b>I know.</b>

846
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,279
<b>It's ridiculous.</b>

<b>I feel like I'm 15 years</b>

<b>as soon as the 100th loopy</b>

<b>This place hasn't been</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

865

<b>No bad addition to contend with.</b>

867
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,480
<b>A clean pallet.</b>

<b>One owner.</b>

869

<b>Well, yes.</b>

871

00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,640
<b>Lauren?</b>

906
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,079
<b>When did she die?</b>

907
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,200
<b>Five years ago, May 30th.</b>

908
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,039
<b>Or didn't Big Mouth</b>

909
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,160
<b>Maggie tell you that part?</b>

910
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,839
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

911
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,640
<b>It's none of my business.</b>

912
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,039
<b>No, it's OK.</b>

913
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:16,319
<b>But I'm sure it's still incredibly painful.</b>

914
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,079
<b>You know, you always think</b>

915
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:24,000
<b>that it will get less painful.</b>

916
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,519
<b>But the fact of the matter is it doesn't.</b>

917
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,359
<b>How long were you together?</b>

918
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,039
<b>Almost 10 years.</b>

919
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:34,960
<b>I mean, we'd known each other</b>

920
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
<b>for a long time before that.</b>

921
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,920
<b>But I wasn't ready to acknowledge it.</b>

922
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,440
<b>And she waited and waited.</b>

923
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,559
<b>I just wish she had been with me for a long time.</b>

924
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:46,759
<b>I just wish that I</b>

925
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,880
<b>hadn't wasted so much time</b>

926
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,599
<b>we didn't end up having.</b>

927
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,240
<b>But I think you were lucky to have the</b>

928
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,160
<b>time you did with her.</b>

929
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:05,880
<b>She was lucky to have it with you.</b>

930
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,079
<b>OK, shall we?</b>

931
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:21,159
<b>Yeah.</b>

932
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,480
<b>Hi, Sandy.</b>

933
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,079
<b>Rita.</b>

934
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,920
<b>How are you?</b>

935
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,840
<b>Fine.</b>

936
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,519
<b>Good.</b>

937
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,800
<b>How are you?</b>

938
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,480
<b>I'm OK.</b>

939
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,920
<b>This is McNally Hayes, Sandy, Rita.</b>

940
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,440
<b>Hi.</b>

941
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,960
<b>Hi.</b>

942
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,519
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

943
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,960
<b>We're late.</b>

944
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:51,840
<b>Have a nice lunch.</b>

945
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,119
<b>Oh, hi.</b>

946
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,039
<b>I didn't know whether or</b>

947
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,039
<b>not I should use my key.</b>

948
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,519
<b>No, you can use the key.</b>

949
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,880
<b>Oh, OK.</b>

950
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,440
<b>So, got the TV all hooked</b>

951
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,320
<b>up, plenty of junk food.</b>

952
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,159
<b>It'll be just like home.</b>

953
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,840
<b>Hey, give me a kiss.</b>

954
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:05,599
<b>You too.</b>

955
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,480
<b>[kiss]</b>

956
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,599
<b>See ya.</b>

957
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:29,280
<b>[crying]</b>

958
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:55,840
<b>[crying]</b>

959
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,800
<b>[crying]</b>

960
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,840
<b>Kate, what are you doing here?</b>

961
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,039
<b>Well, I was alone in my</b>

962
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:15,920
<b>house for the first time</b>

963
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,679
<b>in my entire life.</b>

964
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,519
<b>I had no kids.</b>

965
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,719
<b>I had no husband.</b>

966
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:22,079
<b>I have no friends.</b>

967
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,199
<b>So I came here.</b>

968
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:26,599
<b>Come on in.</b>

969
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:41,400
<b>This is Bob.</b>

970
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,840
<b>Hi, Bob.</b>

971
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,079
<b>What's the matter with you, huh?</b>

972
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,760
<b>You ever seen anybody fall apart before?</b>

973
00:37:47,760 --> 00:38:02,960
<b>Bob, what are the rules, huh? Bob, think you know 'em. [crying] My kids left to spend the</b>

974
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,840
<b>night with Jack for the first time.</b>

975
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,079
<b>And I just came undone.</b>

976
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,119
<b>I've never not been with my kids.</b>

977
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,559
<b>You know, it's funny.</b>

978
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,760
<b>I gave up on my kids.</b>

979
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,639
<b>I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I gave up on myself so</b>

980
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:21,199
<b>long ago to be Jack's wife,</b>

981
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,960
<b>or be Sam's mother, Adam's</b>

982
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,119
<b>mother, to be a homemaker.</b>

983
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,679
<b>I was like a stepford wife.</b>

984
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,079
<b>But I wanted this.</b>

985
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,559
<b>I wanted things to change.</b>

986
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,159
<b>And now, I don't know.</b>

987
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:42,760
<b>I don't know anything.</b>

988
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,840
<b>Do you want them back?</b>

989
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,039
<b>No.</b>

990
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,679
<b>I don't.</b>

991
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,679
<b>But this has torn my kids' lives apart.</b>

992
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,119
<b>And that's the hardest part of it.</b>

993
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,000
<b>It's overwhelming.</b>

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,840
<b>Yeah, of course it is.</b>

995
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,199
<b>I wanted more.</b>

996
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,440
<b>I wanted more from my life.</b>

997
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,760
<b>I wanted more from myself.</b>

998
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,079
<b>And I wanted more from Jack.</b>

999
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,840
<b>But she couldn't or</b>

1000
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,559
<b>didn't want to give me.</b>

1001
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,280
<b>Maybe he didn't know how to.</b>

1002
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,559
<b>I think maybe it was me.</b>

1003
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,920
<b>OK.</b>

1004
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,800
<b>Something in me provoked him.</b>

1005
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,639
<b>No.</b>

1006
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,159
<b>I don't know.</b>

1007
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,840
<b>I don't know anything anymore.</b>

1008
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,400
<b>You know what?</b>

1009
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,320
<b>This is not all your fault.</b>

1010
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,079
<b>Really, it's not.</b>

1011
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,840
<b>OK.</b>

1012
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,079
<b>You made the right decision.</b>

1013
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:56,000
<b>And you're going to be fine.</b>

1014
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,239
<b>OK?</b>

1015
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,719
<b>You're going to be fine.</b>

1016
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,079
<b>OK, don't--</b>

1017
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:05,719
<b>Why?</b>

1018
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,360
<b>Because you don't know what you're doing.</b>

1019
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,800
<b>You don't know what this means.</b>

1020
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:08,920
<b>Yes, I do.</b>

1021
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,400
<b>It's what I feel.</b>

1022
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,440
<b>It's a little more complicated than that.</b>

1023
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,079
<b>You're straight, and this is wrong.</b>

1024
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,639
<b>And you're just</b>

1025
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,079
<b>responding to a little kindness,</b>

1026
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,599
<b>to a little attention.</b>

1027
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,599
<b>That's all.</b>

1028
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,639
<b>You just don't have a clue.</b>

1029
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,039
<b>It's not what I'm responding to.</b>

1030
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,800
<b>I'm not some stupid teenager man.</b>

1031
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,079
<b>Kate, I'm gay, and I know what it means.</b>

1032
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,079
<b>This is my life, not some</b>

1033
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,480
<b>abstract thought or feeling.</b>

1034
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,360
<b>It isn't a switch I</b>

1035
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,440
<b>get to turn on and off,</b>

1036
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,920
<b>and it's not to be taken lightly.</b>

1037
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,960
<b>I don't take this lightly.</b>

1038
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,440
<b>In most of my life, I lived a lie,</b>

1039
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,519
<b>trying to be my mother's daughter,</b>

1040
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,360
<b>not acknowledging the fact that I was gay</b>

1041
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
<b>because I was so scared</b>

1042
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,320
<b>of the hate and the shame</b>

1043
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,599
<b>until I met Lauren.</b>

1044
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,480
<b>And she taught me how not to be afraid.</b>

1045
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,800
<b>But this, it scares the hell out of me.</b>

1046
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,719
<b>And I don't want to be scared anymore.</b>

1047
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,440
<b>And I'm not the one to take another</b>

1048
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,519
<b>person on that journey</b>

1049
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,519
<b>because the first trip almost killed me.</b>

1050
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,320
<b>I didn't mean to put</b>

1051
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,519
<b>you in that position.</b>

1052
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,880
<b>OK.</b>

1053
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,320
<b>It wasn't my intention.</b>

1054
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,960
<b>OK.</b>

1055
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,159
<b>I know.</b>

1056
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,239
<b>I don't know what this means.</b>

1057
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,519
<b>I've never done this before.</b>

1058
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,159
<b>But you should know I was</b>

1059
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:31,920
<b>not looking for a quick fix</b>

1060
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,679
<b>to my problems or the</b>

<b>touch of another human being,</b>

1062

<b>whoever it was.</b>

1063

<b>Believe it or not,</b>

1064
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,119
<b>everything changed for me</b>

1065
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,559
<b>the minute I met you.</b>

1066
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,360
<b>It scares the hell out of me, too.</b>

1067
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:35,800
<b>I should leave. [phone ringing]</b>

1068
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,960
<b>[phone ringing]</b>

1069
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,599
<b>Hey, Israel T.</b>

1070
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,079
<b>This is Mrs. Wilson.</b>

1071
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,920
<b>Let me try herself.</b>

1072
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,000
<b>The person you are trying</b>

1073
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,039
<b>to reach is out of range.</b>

1074
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,119
<b>I'm sorry she's out of range.</b>

1075
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,039
<b>Can I take a message?</b>

1076
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:48,400
<b>If you ever hear me call back.</b>

1077
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,639
<b>I'll tell you a call of Mrs. Wilson.</b>

1078
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,079
<b>Thank you.</b>

1079
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,639
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

1080
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,599
<b>Where is she?</b>

1083
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,880
<b>I'm going out for a smoke.</b>

1084
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,079
<b>Brad, you think you could answer the</b>

1086
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,920
<b>I don't think so.</b>

1087
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,639
<b>It gets really scary.</b>

1088
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,039

<b>Where's Mac?</b>

1092
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,039
<b>Honey, I've known Mac.</b>

1093
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,719
<b>It seems longer than I've known myself.</b>

1094
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,719
<b>And where she is is in the dumper.</b>

1095
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,239
<b>Screwed.</b>

1096
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:46,800
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

1097
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
<b>I've only seen her</b>

<b>Aren't you going to ask me in?</b>

1115
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,360
<b>OK.</b>

1116
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:59,880
<b>Do you want to come in?</b>

1117
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,280
<b>Well, if this is what it's like being</b>

<b>attracted to someone</b>

<b>You're right about that.</b>

1122
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:06,679
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

1123
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:07,840
<b>Being shunned?</b>

1124
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:07,880
<b>You're shunning me.</b>

1125
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,480
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

1126
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,800
<b>And you know, this isn't just about you.</b>

1127
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,119
<b>That's about me, too.</b>

1128
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,639
<b>Well, the least you could do is be an</b>

<b>adult and speak to me.</b>

1130
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:26,119
<b>I'm sick of more dialogue from a woman.</b>

<b>What happened the other night shouldn't</b>

00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:31,920
<b>We can still be friends, can't we?</b>

1134
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:37,639
<b>I don't know how to be</b>

00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,760
<b>Why?</b>

1137
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,480
<b>Because I feel more for you</b>

1138
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,920
<b>than a friend should feel.</b>

1139
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,800
<b>So why don't we just</b>

1140
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,119
<b>stop speaking to each other,</b>

1141
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,519
<b>and I should quit working</b>

1142
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,679
<b>for you and just disappear</b>

1143
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:56,800
<b>because it's easier?</b>

1144
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,400
<b>No.</b>

1145
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,039
<b>I don't know.</b>

1146
00:45:59,039 --> 00:45:59,079
<b>Why is this so simple for me?</b>

1147
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,519
<b>Why is this so simple for you?</b>

1148
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,000
<b>It's not.</b>

1149
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,639
<b>That's the part you're not getting.</b>

1150
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,320
<b>Look, I have a big life</b>

1151
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,440
<b>with lots of people in it,</b>

1152
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,639
<b>and I was prepared to see what my</b>

<b>not knowing if it was real.</b>

1156
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,440
<b>I understand if you can't.</b>

1157
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,800
<b>But I don't understand that you don't</b>

1159
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,039
<b>Don't you know that's all I want to do?</b>

1160
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:47,000
<b>It's to see you, it's to talk to you.</b>

<b>Final translation</b>

<b>Never could I love like this before</b>

1163

<b>'Cause it feels so much more</b>

<b>Than my heart ever knew</b>

<b>Never will I have to search again</b>

<b>For a shelter from the rain</b>

1167
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:03,039
<b>You gave me a brand new start</b>

1168

<b>And I found the missing part in you</b>

1170
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:23,039
<b>Come in. Kids aren't here, remember?</b>

1171
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,679
<b>Yeah, I know. I want to</b>

<b>talk to you for a minute.</b>

1173
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,639
<b>Sure. I'll have to leave</b>

00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:27,920
<b>in a second, but come in.</b>

1175
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,760
<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>You look very nice. Thank you.</b>

<b>Where are you going?</b>

1178
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,400
<b>Dinner with Matt and some clients. What</b>

<b>do you want to talk about?</b>

1180
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,639
<b>Well, I got the divorce papers.</b>

1181
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:44,639
<b>I'm absolutely positive about this.</b>

1182
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:51,840
<b>Yeah, I am. I'm sorry, Jack.</b>

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,360
<b>Nice to see you again.</b>

<b>Yes, nice to see you.</b>

<b>Well, I hope you have a</b>

<b>That's a great</b>

<b>You know, I never thought I'd say that to</b>

<b>someone I was dating.</b>

00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:30,400
<b>Dinner with clients, huh?</b>

1197
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,280
<b>What was I going to say that</b>

1198
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,599
<b>I was going to date with you?</b>

1199
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,880
<b>You know by the look on his face at the</b>

<b>to turn already, right?</b>

1202
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:37,880
<b>So if he hasn't</b>

<b>figured it out, he will soon.</b>

1204
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,800
<b>I'm going to tell him.</b>

00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,119
<b>Just not now.</b>

1206

<b>When?</b>

<b>When your shirt isn't just a face?</b>

1208

<b>It's not fair.</b>

1209
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,840
<b>Sure it is. I mean, I don't know. Maybe</b>

<b>you're just trying it out like a car.</b>

1211
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:55,039
<b>That's insulting and ridiculous.</b>

1212
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,199
<b>Okay, I've seen it</b>

<b>Really? A million?</b>

<b>Don't be stupid. You know what I meant.</b>

<b>Actually, I don't know what you mean</b>

<b>have to be careful now.</b>

1222
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,880
<b>Why?</b>

1223
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,599
<b>Isn't that one of the</b>

<b>perks of being with a woman?</b>

<b>You talk and talk and talk about</b>

00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,679
<b>can't do this, I understand.</b>

1256
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,079
<b>I just want you to know that no matter</b>

1257
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:30,760
<b>what happens, you'll always have a job.</b>

1258
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:38,960
<b>You'll always have me as a friend.</b>

1259
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,519
<b>Hi, we didn't have to</b>

1260
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:50,079
<b>ring our own doorbell.</b>

1261
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:57,159
<b>See you on Saturday.</b>

1262
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:59,440
<b>How's it going?</b>

1263
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,679
<b>Not great. They hate my place. They'd</b>

1264
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,440
<b>rather be in their own</b>

1265
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,719
<b>rooms. I can't blame them.</b>

1266
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,039
<b>Why don't I come over some time and try</b>

1267
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:08,880
<b>and help you make it more of a home?</b>

1268
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,760
<b>Sure.</b>

1269
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,039
<b>Thanks.</b>

1270
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,000
<b>Bye-bye. I have to tell you something.</b>

1271
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,320
<b>Sure.</b>

1272
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:48,320
<b>Go ahead, sweetie.</b>

1273
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,320
<b>As grown up as I</b>

1274
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,039
<b>pretend to be, I'm really not.</b>

1275
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:55,400
<b>One minute I understand it, and then the</b>

1276
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,280
<b>next minute I don't.</b>

1277
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,719
<b>I'm really not okay that</b>

1278
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,039
<b>we're not a family anymore.</b>

1279
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:05,039
<b>But we are still a family. Fractured,</b>

1280
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:07,079
<b>yes, but a family nonetheless.</b>

1281
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,519
<b>It's not the same.</b>

1282
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,239
<b>And the thing is, I guess I thought life</b>

1283
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:14,960
<b>would always be the same.</b>

1284
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,320
<b>Things would never change, which is</b>

1285
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,400
<b>stupid, because everything changes.</b>

1286
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,480
<b>But I never thought the first person to</b>

1287
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:42,119
<b>move out of the house would be Dad.</b>

1288
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,440
<b>Sandy, this is a surprise.</b>

1289
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,519
<b>Can I come in so I don't have to stand on</b>

1290
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:47,960
<b>here groveling in front of the neighbors?</b>

1291
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:55,119
<b>Sure. Come on in.</b>

1292
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,199
<b>I just came over to apologize.</b>

1293
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:03,400
<b>I guess I didn't want you to shake things</b>

1294
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,880
<b>up, because then that just means I'd have</b>

1295
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,239
<b>to take a look at my life</b>

1296
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,400
<b>and see how crappy it is.</b>

1297
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,920
<b>I get it. But I'm</b>

1298
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,079
<b>really glad you came over.</b>

1299
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,480
<b>Me too.</b>

1300
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,679
<b>Do you love your job?</b>

1301
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:16,679
<b>I do.</b>

1302
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,519
<b>Are you going to start dating again soon?</b>

1303
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:21,039
<b>Oh, God, what a terrible fog.</b>

1304
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:21,639
<b>Well, you know, it's</b>

1305
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,159
<b>funny you should mention that.</b>

1306
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:24,519
<b>I'm going to tell you something, because</b>

1307
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:25,920
<b>even though you're a snob, I think you're</b>

1308
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,039
<b>an open-minded snob.</b>

1309
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:31,800
<b>And I think I am attracted to someone.</b>

1310
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,480
<b>Who?</b>

1311
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,559
<b>The woman I work for.</b>

1312
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,599
<b>You're joking.</b>

1313
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:42,519
<b>No.</b>

1314
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:44,000
<b>I don't believe you.</b>

1315
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:46,320
<b>Oh, why would you be so</b>

1316
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,440
<b>shocked? Your sister's gay.</b>

1317
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,079
<b>Because I don't approve of her lifestyle.</b>

1318
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,159
<b>Since when did you become a bigot?</b>

1319
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:56,440
<b>I'm not a bigot.</b>

1320
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,559
<b>Must be tiring to sit in</b>

1321
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:02,199
<b>judgment of everyone, Sandy.</b>

1322
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,280
<b>Jack?</b>

1323
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:03,800
<b>Dad?</b>

1324
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,400
<b>Hey, hey, I'm in the kitchen.</b>

1325
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:09,840
<b>Hey.</b>

1326
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,280
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

1327
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,039
<b>I'm impressed.</b>

1328
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,960
<b>Yeah, I made enough if you want to stay.</b>

1329
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,039
<b>Sure, sure. That'd be nice.</b>

1330
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,320
<b>Great.</b>

1331
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,880
<b>You know, Dad, if it isn't any good, we</b>

1332
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,920
<b>could always hire a</b>

1333
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,679
<b>cook or a maid who cooks.</b>

1334
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,800
<b>Yes, I realize that, but I am trying to</b>

1335
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,039
<b>spend more quality time with</b>

1336
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,960
<b>my children, if you don't mind.</b>

1337
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,360
<b>If you don't mind, it's just you think</b>

1338
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,320
<b>poisoning your kids is the</b>

1339
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,679
<b>best way to bond with them?</b>

1340
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:40,079
<b>Same.</b>

1341
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:40,840
<b>So?</b>

1342
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,280
<b>Not bad.</b>

1343
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,440
<b>Yeah?</b>

1344
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,000
<b>I was very impressed, Jack.</b>

1345
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,800
<b>Thank you.</b>

1346
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,079
<b>Can I go over to Betsy's?</b>

1347
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,440
<b>Yes. After you do the dishes.</b>

1348
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,280
<b>That's okay, honey. I'll do them.</b>

1349
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,039
<b>You see how shallow</b>

1350
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,320
<b>their love for me really is?</b>

1351
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,000
<b>Can I go to Peter's?</b>

1352
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,559
<b>What is wrong with you guys?</b>

1353
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,079
<b>You have your mother and father in the</b>

1354
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,519
<b>same place, together</b>

1355
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:05,199
<b>again, and you want to leave.</b>

1356
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:05,880
<b>Yeah.</b>

1357
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,519
<b>Yeah.</b>

1358
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:08,039
<b>Go. Get out of here.</b>

1359
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:11,440
<b>I, I, I, I, kiss, kiss.</b>

1360
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,800
<b>My home. I'm good, Tom.</b>

1361
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,360
<b>See ya.</b>

1362
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,320
<b>See ya. Bye, Dad.</b>

1363
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,400
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

1364
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,079
<b>Well, it's good to know</b>

1365
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:20,360
<b>something's never changed.</b>

1366
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:20,920
<b>Yeah.</b>

1367
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,039
<b>You know, I, I could do some stuff in the</b>

1368
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:25,719
<b>living room, if you like,</b>

1369
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,119
<b>to help make things better.</b>

1370
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,440
<b>Yeah, that'd, uh, be great.</b>

1371
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,800
<b>See ya. It looks a little better, huh?</b>

1372
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,480
<b>Maybe, maybe there's some curtains, you</b>

1373
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,719
<b>know, and, uh, little</b>

1374
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:25,360
<b>black and white photos.</b>

1375
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,719
<b>Stuff.</b>

1376
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:30,119
<b>Yeah. Definitely looks better.</b>

1377
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:32,119
<b>Jack, we need to talk.</b>

1378
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:35,079
<b>Yeah. The rule is you can only say that</b>

1379
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:38,760
<b>once in a lifetime to the same person.</b>

1380
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,199
<b>That's it.</b>

1381
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:53,760
<b>I need to tell you something so you don't</b>

1382
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,280
<b>find out another way.</b>

1383
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:05,079
<b>Uh, what are you talking about?</b>

1384
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,039
<b>I'm attracted to</b>

1385
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:09,079
<b>someone and I'm pursuing it.</b>

1386
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:16,360
<b>Who is he?</b>

1387
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,840
<b>It's not a he, it's Mac.</b>

1388
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,000
<b>Mac? Who's...</b>

1389
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,440
<b>Maybe Mac, your boss?</b>

1390
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,840
<b>What, if Mac's a woman, what is...</b>

1391
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,199
<b>You can't be attracted to a woman.</b>

1392
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:34,559
<b>She's a person, Jack.</b>

1393
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:35,280
<b>What are you talking</b>

1394
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,840
<b>about? She's a woman.</b>

1395
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,440
<b>I don't understand this.</b>

1396
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,039
<b>What are you telling me here?</b>

1397
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:43,920
<b>That our whole life</b>

1398
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,199
<b>together was this big lie?</b>

1399
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,440
<b>No, that's not true.</b>

1400
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,360
<b>Well, then explain something to me. How</b>

1401
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,039
<b>can you suddenly be attracted to a woman?</b>

1402
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,000
<b>I don't know.</b>

1403
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,159
<b>I wasn't even looking for any kind of</b>

1404
00:59:58,159 --> 00:59:58,880
<b>relationship and</b>

1405
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,440
<b>certainly not one with a woman.</b>

1406
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,079
<b>Wait a second, wait a second, wait a</b>

1407
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:03,719
<b>second, wait a second.</b>

1408
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:08,639
<b>Is this the problem? Is this the problem?</b>

1409
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,039
<b>All along, deep down inside, you had</b>

1410
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,800
<b>these feelings, you felt this way, and</b>

1411
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,800
<b>that's why our marriage failed?</b>

1412
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,159
<b>No, the failure of our</b>

1413
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:20,159
<b>marriage is both our faults.</b>

1414
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,519
<b>It's nothing to do with Mac or any other</b>

1415
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:23,599
<b>woman. I've never had feelings for</b>

1416
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:24,679
<b>another woman in my life,</b>

1417
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:28,719
<b>Jack, and I met Mac after we split.</b>

1418
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,039
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

1419
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,880
<b>You don't have to. It's not about you.</b>

1420
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,039
<b>No, really, really, it's</b>

1421
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,280
<b>not about me. That's great.</b>

1422
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,679
<b>Okay, let me put it another way.</b>

1423
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,639
<b>It's my life and I can live it any way I</b>

1424
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:53,199
<b>want. It doesn't concern you.</b>

1425
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:58,679
<b>Okay. But it does concern my children,</b>

1426
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:01,000
<b>and I will not have them around this.</b>

1427
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:02,440
<b>What does that mean?</b>

1428
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,199
<b>It means that you have put them through</b>

1429
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:05,920
<b>enough, and you are not</b>

1430
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,719
<b>going to do this to them too.</b>

1431
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:10,360
<b>Monday morning, I am</b>

1432
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,559
<b>filing papers for sole custody.</b>

1433
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:35,519
<b>Hey, what's wrong?</b>

1434
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:38,599
<b>I told Jack about us. Mainly because</b>

1435
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:40,440
<b>Sammy came by to apologize, and like an</b>

1436
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,639
<b>idiot, I thought I could share something</b>

1437
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,039
<b>with my best friend who has a gay sister.</b>

1438
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:45,719
<b>Instead, she's the moral</b>

1439
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:48,039
<b>majority. I'm an idiot.</b>

1440
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:50,280
<b>Yeah, bigotry is stunning, isn't it?</b>

1441
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,559
<b>Afraid that's not the end of it. Jack</b>

1442
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,039
<b>wants to take the kids away from me.</b>

1443
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:55,920
<b>He's just scared. He</b>

1444
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,320
<b>doesn't really mean it.</b>

1445
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,400
<b>Tell that to the court he's</b>

1446
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,639
<b>filing papers with Monday.</b>

1447
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:02,199
<b>Oh, God. I don't know what to do. I don't</b>

1448
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:03,280
<b>want to tell the kids. I feel like</b>

1449
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,519
<b>they've been through enough already, but</b>

1450
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:06,360
<b>I'm afraid if I don't, he will.</b>

1451
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,039
<b>And I don't want him to</b>

1452
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,400
<b>drag you into court either.</b>

1453
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,559
<b>Don't worry about me.</b>

1454
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,800
<b>I think I have to tell him</b>

1455
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,719
<b>before he does. Are you sure?</b>

1456
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:16,639
<b>I don't think I have a</b>

1457
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,280
<b>choice. He's forced my hand.</b>

1458
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,400
<b>Maybe you should wait.</b>

1459
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,440
<b>Well, I have to tell Sam</b>

1460
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:31,320
<b>at least before he does.</b>

1461
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,719
<b>Listen, I'm sorry for the saying yes,</b>

1462
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:38,000
<b>saying no, saying yes thing.</b>

1463
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:41,360
<b>Please have faith in me.</b>

1464
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,920
<b>I know I sound like a broken record, but</b>

1465
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:49,519
<b>are you sure about this? About us?</b>

1466
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,159
<b>I don't know if this is going to last</b>

1467
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:56,440
<b>forever, but the night that we fought and</b>

1468
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,159
<b>you left, it was as if</b>

1469
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:00,039
<b>someone pulled my heart out.</b>

1470
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:02,400
<b>And when you came back, you brought my</b>

1471
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,599
<b>heart with you. So right</b>

1472
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:11,039
<b>here, right now, yeah, I'm sure.</b>

1473
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,920
<b>There are some real consequences, which</b>

1474
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,440
<b>you've just encountered. Are</b>

1475
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,719
<b>you prepared for more of that?</b>

1476
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,159
<b>No. Kate, I don't want you to</b>

1477
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:22,440
<b>lose your kids because of me.</b>

1478
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,360
<b>I don't want to lose my kids either.</b>

1479
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,880
<b>The truth is, maybe I'm not prepared for</b>

1480
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,079
<b>any of this, but I made an adult</b>

1481
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,320
<b>conscious choice to be with you. Not a</b>

1482
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,639
<b>man, not a woman, but you.</b>

1483
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:40,199
<b>I am prepared to stand by my</b>

1484
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:43,719
<b>heart, which I've given to you.</b>

1485
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:45,840
<b>As complex as it might</b>

1486
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:51,239
<b>be. This much, I know.</b>

1487
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,039
<b>Hey, Bob.</b>

1488
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,400
<b>Hey, Joe.</b>

1489
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:25,119
<b>Why'd you pull me out of a play date?</b>

1490
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,920
<b>I was kidding. What's</b>

1491
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,360
<b>happened? Is it Dad? Adam?</b>

1492
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,280
<b>No, honey. Everyone's fine.</b>

1493
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,159
<b>Then what?</b>

1494
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,800
<b>I need to tell you something that's going</b>

1495
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,079
<b>to be very difficult.</b>

1496
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,480
<b>On a scale of one to ten, with ten being</b>

1497
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,559
<b>a divorce, what would it be?</b>

1498
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:48,239
<b>Two, Sam.</b>

1499
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:48,719
<b>Six?</b>

1500
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,039
<b>I don't know.</b>

1501
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:53,280
<b>Okay, just tell me.</b>

1502
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,559
<b>It's hard to put into words.</b>

1503
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,159
<b>I'm not going to guess.</b>

1504
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:03,280
<b>Well, you know how your teacher, Mr.</b>

1505
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,199
<b>Jackson, lives with a man, and I've</b>

1506
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:06,679
<b>always told you you could</b>

1507
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:09,400
<b>love or be with anybody.</b>

1508
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
<b>Yeah?</b>

1509
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,360
<b>Well, you know Mac,</b>

1510
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,920
<b>the woman I work with.</b>

1511
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,599
<b>Yeah, she's a lesbian. So?</b>

1512
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:17,800
<b>How did you know that?</b>

1513
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,920
<b>I'm not dumb.</b>

1514
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,800
<b>But how could you know? She</b>

1515
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,079
<b>doesn't even look like one.</b>

1516
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:23,559
<b>No, she doesn't look like one. Look, Mom,</b>

1517
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:25,039
<b>could you please tell me why you dragged</b>

1518
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,039
<b>me out of Betsy's house?</b>

1519
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,280
<b>I... I really... I</b>

1520
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,760
<b>don't know how to start.</b>

1521
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,679
<b>Mom, just start somewhere.</b>

1522
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:39,519
<b>Well, Mac and I have become very good</b>

1523
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,440
<b>friends, as you know.</b>

1524
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,960
<b>And I know this is going to sound</b>

1525
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:50,599
<b>strange, but I'm attracted to her.</b>

1526
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,079
<b>Okay. I don't</b>

1527
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,800
<b>understand. What do you mean?</b>

1528
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,679
<b>I'm attracted to Mac like I used to be</b>

1529
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:03,599
<b>attracted to your father.</b>

1530
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,519
<b>You mean in a sexual way?</b>

1531
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:09,519
<b>Yeah.</b>

1532
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:10,199
<b>That would make you</b>

1533
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,599
<b>gay and you're not gay.</b>

1534
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,800
<b>No, I'm not. I mean, I wasn't. But if I</b>

1535
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,440
<b>want to be with Mac, I guess I am.</b>

1536
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,519
<b>You've only known her for a few months. I</b>

1537
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:21,719
<b>mean, I don't understand.</b>

1538
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:23,159
<b>Did you like girls before?</b>

1539
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:24,079
<b>No.</b>

1540
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,320
<b>Well, you said people were born that way.</b>

1541
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,199
<b>Well, I don't look at Mac as a woman. I</b>

1542
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:33,199
<b>look at her as a person.</b>

1543
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:36,320
<b>I... I don't understand. And you weren't</b>

1544
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:42,920
<b>born gay. But now you are. And...</b>

1545
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,039
<b>You're with a woman? I don't get it.</b>

1546
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:49,159
<b>I know. I... I don't know what happened.</b>

1547
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:50,519
<b>I don't know what it means. Does this</b>

1548
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:51,800
<b>mean I'm gay forever now?</b>

1549
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,400
<b>I... I don't know, Sam. I know this is a</b>

1550
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,360
<b>shock to you. It's a</b>

1551
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,199
<b>shock to me too, but...</b>

1552
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:03,280
<b>I told your father and he's really upset.</b>

1553
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,039
<b>Gee, I wonder why.</b>

1554
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:09,800
<b>Don't let the nose ring and</b>

1555
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,480
<b>the purple streak fool you.</b>

1556
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:23,360
<b>I'm upset too.</b>

1557
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:29,079
<b>Honey, I care immensely for Mac. And the</b>

1558
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:32,119
<b>only reason I'm telling you all this is</b>

1559
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:33,079
<b>because your father was</b>

1560
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:35,880
<b>to take you away from me.</b>

1561
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:40,039
<b>Now, maybe he's just angry. Maybe not.</b>

1562
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:46,480
<b>But I'm telling you because I love you.</b>

1563
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,679
<b>And I don't want to lose you.</b>

1564
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,719
<b>You know what? I don't really want to</b>

1565
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:57,320
<b>talk about it anymore.</b>

1566
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,119
<b>I raised you to have an open mind.</b>

1567
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:01,880
<b>Please, honey, can't</b>

1568
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,039
<b>we just talk about this?</b>

1569
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:12,280
<b>No. No. We're done talking.</b>

1570
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:20,880
<b>I know that's a very good idea.</b>

1571
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:26,880
<b>Jack is angry enough to try to get</b>

1572
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,720
<b>everyone on his side to get custody,</b>

1573
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,640
<b>including my dear old mother, who, by the</b>

1574
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,880
<b>way, is rich enough to buy the court.</b>

1575
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,520
<b>Even Bob doesn't think it's a good idea.</b>

1576
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,159
<b>I'm just hoping that blood is thicker</b>

1577
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,319
<b>than I've been lit to believe.</b>

1578
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:43,880
<b>Don't count on it.</b>

1579
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,600
<b>Hey, Katie. Is your mother expecting you?</b>

1580
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,399
<b>No.</b>

1581
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,439
<b>You know how she hates surprises.</b>

1582
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:05,199
<b>Yeah, well, she's going to love tonight.</b>

1583
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:06,239
<b>She's in the bath now, but</b>

1584
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:09,600
<b>she'll be down soon. What is it?</b>

1585
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,159
<b>I'm going to try this out on you first.</b>

1586
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,760
<b>Ten seconds left. Brad,</b>

1587
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,640
<b>sorry. I... Come on in.</b>

1588
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,399
<b>No.</b>

1589
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:33,800
<b>Okay. Stand there.</b>

1590
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,319
<b>I just came by to tell you that I think</b>

1591
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:52,760
<b>Lauren would've really liked Kate.</b>

1592
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,319
<b>Okay, Katie, what's going on?</b>

1593
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:04,159
<b>Well, I've met someone, romantically.</b>

1594
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,800
<b>Well, if you're happy, I'm happy. You</b>

1595
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,159
<b>know I'm not speaking for your mother.</b>

1596
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:10,640
<b>But I don't know why you're</b>

1597
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,079
<b>making such a big fuss over it.</b>

1598
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:16,199
<b>Well, the thing is, the person that I met</b>

1599
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:17,560
<b>and I'm involved with,</b>

1600
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:24,439
<b>romantically, is a woman.</b>

1601
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:31,920
<b>What? You don't have anything to say?</b>

1602
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:39,159
<b>I'm thinking about it.</b>

1603
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,920
<b>I haven't seen you this happy since you</b>

1604
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,600
<b>got that swing out back when you were 12.</b>

1605
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:51,079
<b>So it's okay with me.</b>

1606
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:52,560
<b>May I make a suggestion?</b>

1607
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,000
<b>Sure.</b>

1608
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,279
<b>I'd get out of this house</b>

1609
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:55,039
<b>before your mother comes down.</b>

1610
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,159
<b>Who wouldn't take Walt Geddy's name when</b>

1611
01:10:57,159 --> 01:10:58,640
<b>you're talking to, Mary?</b>

1612
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,840
<b>I know it's too late for your soap opera.</b>

1613
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,520
<b>No, it's not.</b>

1614
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,720
<b>Well, Bellwell, an unannounced visitor.</b>

1615
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,159
<b>You know how I love that.</b>

1616
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:12,680
<b>I know you do, Mother.</b>

1617
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,319
<b>That's too much, Mary.</b>

1618
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:19,279
<b>No. Trust me, it's not.</b>

1619
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,039
<b>Well, what is it?</b>

1620
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,479
<b>I hope you haven't come over here to ask</b>

1621
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,079
<b>me to babysit for your children now that</b>

1622
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,159
<b>you're a single mother with a job.</b>

1623
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,920
<b>God, that was hard to say.</b>

1624
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,079
<b>You know, Mother, I think they'd sooner</b>

1625
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,840
<b>have their eyes gouged out.</b>

1626
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,920
<b>You know what your problem</b>

1627
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,199
<b>is, what it's always been?</b>

1628
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,760
<b>No, but I'm sure you're going to tell me.</b>

1629
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,119
<b>You're a smartass. Always have been.</b>

1630
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,399
<b>I know.</b>

1631
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:43,920
<b>What?</b>

1632
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,680
<b>Just spit it out.</b>

1633
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,760
<b>Well, I've met someone, and</b>

1634
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,039
<b>I'm seeing them romantically.</b>

1635
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:57,119
<b>Well, that was a little</b>

1636
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:58,680
<b>fast, don't you think?</b>

1637
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,520
<b>Yeah.</b>

1638
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:07,840
<b>And it's a woman.</b>

1639
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,960
<b>Mary, you don't need to hear this.</b>

1640
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,039
<b>I won't have it.</b>

1641
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:18,640
<b>Do you hear me?</b>

1642
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,199
<b>It's really not up to you, Mother.</b>

1643
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:22,039
<b>It's against God.</b>

1644
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:24,319
<b>You'll burn in hell for it.</b>

1645
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,960
<b>Well, then I'll burn in hell for it.</b>

1646
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,880
<b>It's not natural,</b>

1647
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,560
<b>don't you understand that?</b>

1648
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,319
<b>To care about another human being who is</b>

1649
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:34,439
<b>spectacular is natural.</b>

1650
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:36,199
<b>I've finally come back to life.</b>

1651
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:37,880
<b>Mother, I've waited years for someone</b>

1652
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,399
<b>like Mack to come along.</b>

1653
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:42,199
<b>What kind of a name is that for a woman?</b>

1654
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,840
<b>Is that a lesbian nickname of some sort?</b>

1655
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,800
<b>No, it's not.</b>

1656
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,159
<b>I did not raise my</b>

1657
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,000
<b>daughter to be a lesbian.</b>

1658
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,520
<b>This is not about you.</b>

1659
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,319
<b>I won't have it. You'll</b>

1660
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:58,880
<b>stop seeing her right now.</b>

1661
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,399
<b>I'm an adult now, much</b>

1662
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:01,239
<b>to your astonishment.</b>

1663
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:04,720
<b>You can't boss me around anymore.</b>

1664
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,680
<b>But you can stop seeing</b>

1665
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,319
<b>me, which I hope you won't.</b>

1666
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:12,880
<b>Because in spite of all of</b>

1667
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,560
<b>our problems, you're my mother.</b>

1668
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:19,800
<b>And I love you.</b>

1669
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,119
<b>And I'm your only child.</b>

1670
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:25,880
<b>So I hope once the shock wears off,</b>

1671
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,039
<b>you'll try to open your</b>

1672
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,640
<b>mind to this and accept it.</b>

1673
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,720
<b>There's one thing you can count on.</b>

1674
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:40,079
<b>That day will never come.</b>

1675
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,319
<b>What?</b>

1676
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:08,640
<b>Sorry. It didn't go well</b>

1677
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,880
<b>with your mother, did it?</b>

1678
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:17,800
<b>No, it did not.</b>

1679
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,720
<b>What happened?</b>

1680
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,640
<b>She pretty much did the</b>

1681
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,560
<b>biblical thing and disowned me.</b>

1682
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,800
<b>I didn't have to give her time. My mother</b>

1683
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,600
<b>did the same thing and</b>

1684
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,920
<b>now we couldn't be closer.</b>

1685
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,000
<b>First of all, your mother</b>

1686
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,039
<b>and my mother are not the same.</b>

1687
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,319
<b>We've never been close. And she doesn't need time because she's</b>

1688
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,399
<b>going to feel this way forever.</b>

1689
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:37,359
<b>So in addition to not having a mother, I</b>

1690
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:39,520
<b>have a daughter who's processing it.</b>

1691
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,520
<b>A son who doesn't know.</b>

1692
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,800
<b>An ex-best friend who's all of a sudden</b>

1693
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,600
<b>is related to Jerry Falwell.</b>

1694
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,479
<b>Husband who wants to take my kids away.</b>

1695
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:49,119
<b>So all in all, I'd say this coming out</b>

1696
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:51,239
<b>thing's been a big hit.</b>

1697
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,159
<b>I did try to warn you that</b>

1698
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:55,119
<b>it could get really messy.</b>

1699
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,560
<b>I did not get this messy if I did.</b>

1700
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,960
<b>What?</b>

1701
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,199
<b>You wouldn't have done it or you wouldn't</b>

1702
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:03,960
<b>have had feelings for me?</b>

1703
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,399
<b>Or you wouldn't have</b>

1704
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:08,039
<b>gone through with it?</b>

1705
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:10,960
<b>I don't know.</b>

1706
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,760
<b>Then I should leave.</b>

1707
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,560
<b>No, no, no.</b>

1708
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,800
<b>Then what do you want me to do?</b>

1709
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,399
<b>I don't know.</b>

1710
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,960
<b>Because I can't sit here and let you lose</b>

1711
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,079
<b>everything because of me.</b>

1712
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:23,159
<b>One minute I think I can handle it and</b>

1713
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:25,039
<b>the next I'm sure I can't.</b>

1714
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:29,720
<b>Then I think of you and I know I'm</b>

1715
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,039
<b>completely out of my mind.</b>

1716

<b>Kate.</b>

1719
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:23,039
<b>I'll go.</b>

1720
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,359
<b>No, no, it's fine.</b>

1721
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,199
<b>It concerns both of you.</b>

1722
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,479
<b>Mary called me and she</b>

1723
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,079
<b>told me how Dorothy reacted.</b>

1724
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:36,119
<b>Which was pretty much how I reacted.</b>

1725
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:39,279
<b>And I don't want to be like your mother.</b>

1726
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:39,920
<b>You know, I don't want</b>

1727
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,159
<b>to be small and petty.</b>

1728
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,920
<b>But I do want to be small and petty, but</b>

1729
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,800
<b>Sam says that's a really bad thing to be.</b>

1730
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,039
<b>She's a kid and somehow, I</b>

1731
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:58,239
<b>don't know how she knows that.</b>

1732
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,640
<b>She also forced me to come down here,</b>

1733
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,520
<b>which I really did not want to do.</b>

1734
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,079
<b>My instinct was to hurt you.</b>

1735
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,039
<b>The way you hurt me.</b>

1736
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:10,880
<b>But see, I don't want to do that either.</b>

1737
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,399
<b>I don't want to take</b>

1738
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:15,720
<b>the kids away from you.</b>

1739
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:22,399
<b>I don't understand what you're doing.</b>

1740
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:23,319
<b>Maybe I never will.</b>

1741
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,720
<b>Maybe I would have known how to compete</b>

1742
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:30,319
<b>with another guy, but I have no idea how</b>

1743
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:34,800
<b>to compete with a woman.</b>

1744
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:40,520
<b>Very confused.</b>

1745
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,960
<b>But what I loved about you when we met,</b>

1746
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:51,920
<b>I still love about you.</b>

1747

<b>I want you to be happy.</b>

1748
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,359
<b>And I want to be happy too, so...</b>

1749
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:02,560
<b>I'm going to try and do better.</b>

1750
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,239
<b>That's all I wanted to say.</b>

1751

<b>(Music)</b>

1752
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:34,039
<b>Hey, beautiful.</b>

1753
01:18:34,039 --> 01:18:36,640
<b>Hi, Mary.</b>

1754
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,399
<b>Would you consider us living together</b>

1755
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:43,079
<b>someday in the faraway future?</b>

1756
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:44,840
<b>Not the reaction I was hoping for.</b>

1757
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,479
<b>Oh, you need to slow down.</b>

1758
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:51,520
<b>I just jumped through some huge hoops.</b>

1759
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,079
<b>I'm too tired right now to even think</b>

1760
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:56,159
<b>about jumping through another one.</b>

1761
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,159
<b>And as you're saying</b>

1762
01:18:57,159 --> 01:18:58,800
<b>goes, "Love me, love my dog."</b>

1763
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,159
<b>Mine is, "Love me, love my two kids."</b>

1764
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:01,920
<b>And they're not nearly</b>

1765
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,159
<b>as well trained as Bob is.</b>

1766
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:09,039
<b>Hey, are you prepared for that?</b>

1767
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:10,279
<b>An instant family?</b>

1768
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,880
<b>One of whom doesn't even know about us?</b>

1769
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,600
<b>Yes.</b>

1770
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,800
<b>Well, I'm going to have to catch my</b>

1771
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,159
<b>breath. That's a big leap.</b>

1772
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:26,840
<b>Okay.</b>

1773
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:38,399
<b>Just a breath.</b>

1774
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:39,239
<b>Since when do you care if</b>

1775
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:40,039
<b>your grandma comes to anything?</b>

1776
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:54,119
<b>I don't. I'm doing this for Mom.</b>

1777
01:19:54,119 --> 01:20:01,039
<b>Don't get up.</b>

1778
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:07,720
<b>(Music)</b>

1779
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,159
<b>If you've come here to lecture me, you</b>

1780
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:11,000
<b>know where the door is.</b>

1781
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,239
<b>We didn't come here to lecture you.</b>

1782
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:15,159
<b>I came here to invite</b>

1783
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:18,560
<b>you to my graduation.</b>

1784
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,760
<b>Isn't that sweet?</b>

1785
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,079
<b>And I'm sure your mother and</b>

1786
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:24,039
<b>that woman will be there too.</b>

1787
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,880
<b>I'm sorry, Samantha, but</b>

1788
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:33,680
<b>I won't be where they are.</b>

1789
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,720
<b>First of all, that woman</b>

1790
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,399
<b>has a name. It's McNally.</b>

1791
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:40,760
<b>And second of all, this</b>

1792
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,279
<b>isn't about you. It's about me.</b>

1793
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:46,399
<b>This is my graduation.</b>

1794
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:50,199
<b>And if you don't come, you don't have a</b>

1795
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:59,119
<b>daughter or a granddaughter.</b>

1796
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:08,720
<b>It's so much easier, Dorothy, to remember</b>

1797
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,800
<b>why you love someone</b>

1798
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,720
<b>and to move past things,</b>

1799
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:18,920
<b>even if you don't understand them.</b>

1800
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:26,319
<b>You can just pretend to, like I'm doing.</b>

1801
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:30,119
<b>Kate's a remarkable person.</b>

1802
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,319
<b>She gave me that kid.</b>

1803
01:21:33,319 --> 01:21:35,439
<b>Even you have to admit.</b>

1804
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,119
<b>That's some kid.</b>

1805
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,600
<b>We present to you the</b>

1806
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,039
<b>graduating class of 2002.</b>

1807
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:55,560
<b>[Music]</b>

1808
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:04,359
<b>I'm very proud of you, Sam, and I love</b>

1809
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:05,880
<b>you very, very much.</b>

1810
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,439
<b>Don't you dare make me cry. It took me</b>

1811
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:12,880
<b>three hours to get my eyeliner on.</b>

1812
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:13,800
<b>I'm really sorry it took</b>

1813
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,119
<b>me so long to come around.</b>

1814
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:18,960
<b>I know you didn't raise me that way.</b>

1815
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,319
<b>Honey, what made you change your mind?</b>

1816
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:24,600
<b>I realize that you're really happy now. I</b>

1817
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,560
<b>mean, you haven't been for a long time.</b>

1818
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,560
<b>That's it. Simple, huh?</b>

1819
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,039
<b>You are a spectacular person.</b>

1820
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:37,640
<b>You should stop pushing me. I'll get</b>

1821
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,640
<b>there when I get there.</b>

1822
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,399
<b>Yes, and we'll all be dead by then.</b>

1823
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:43,079
<b>What do I call her? What do I call them?</b>

1824
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:50,760
<b>They have names, Grandma. Start there.</b>

1825
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,439
<b>See you about that. I'm glad you took</b>

1826
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:53,760
<b>that thing out anyway.</b>

1827
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,079
<b>You're a graduate. Why did you do this?</b>

1828
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:57,439
<b>Isn't this a foreshadow?</b>

1829
01:23:57,439 --> 01:23:58,920
<b>-Is it? -No, it's permanent.</b>

1830
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,399
<b>Now that the ceremony makes you a maid,</b>

1831
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:05,600
<b>this is Mac. This is my mother Dorothy.</b>

1832
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:11,399
<b>Hello, Dorothy. Nice to meet you.</b>

1833
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:13,359
<b>-Hi. -Brad?</b>

1834
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:15,079
<b>-How are you? -I'm good.</b>

1835
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:16,840
<b>-First thing. -Yes.</b>

1836
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:21,199
<b>-I'll work together. -Yes.</b>
