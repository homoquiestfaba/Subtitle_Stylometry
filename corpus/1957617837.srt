00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,133
Monet, get this.

187
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,120
I don't remember a thing, right?

188
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,580
Until I wake up the next
morning and all his stuff

189
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,260
is in this huge pile and
there's like all these

190
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,700
precious jewels and stuff.

191
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,523
And he gets down on one knee and he says,

192
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,560
I've burned all my worldly possessions

193
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,500
for the greater love of thee.

194
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,778
- Wow, Mary Jo.

195
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:45,720
(Monet chuckles)

196
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,880
- So I say, where will we go?

197
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,910
And then he said, I will
take you to my palace.

198
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,970
I mean, I was speechless.

199
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,290
- Now that's hard to believe.

200
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,260
- I was, believe it.

201
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,030
I mean, never before in my entire life

202
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,650
have I been championed so greatly.

203
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,193
- Yeah, so what's this
champion's name, huh?

204
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,273
- Navy.

205
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:06,930
- Navy.

206
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,300
It's a great story, Mary Jo.

207
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,363
You have one hell of an imagination.

208
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,010
- He's gonna be here any
minute now to get me.

209
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,850
- Yeah, of course he will.

210
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,420
- [Mary Jo] Any second now.

211
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,733
- Mary Jo, why do you do this to yourself?

212
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,047
- Any moment now.

213
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,774
(enchanting music)

214
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,441
- Come on, let's go.

215
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,182
- Who's this?

216
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:42,932
(charming music)

217
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:48,793
- It's Navy.

218
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:54,881
Have you come back for me?

219
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,900
- Yeah, so uh, why don't
you grab your things

220
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,733
and let's go.

221
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:02,904
(enchanting music)

222
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,883
What's wrong?

223
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,489
- I can't move my legs.

224
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,740
- I'll carry you out then.

225
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:17,143
Come on, baby.

226
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:17,976
Let's go.

227
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,641
(Navy groans)

228
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:25,724
(upbeat dance music)

229
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:34,130
(background chatter)

230
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,580
- Shortly afterward, the crocodile made

231
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,940
a sound so very human that
it was almost a remark.

232
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,503
Ac-acho observed the reptile.

233
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:01,190
Ac-acho, ac-acho, ac-acho it repeated

234
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,023
in intervals.

235
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:04,473
Opening its jaws wide every time.

236
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,520
So how many has that been?

237
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,768
- I think about 13.

238
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,503
Not including Cinderella
which you read twice.

239
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,871
(Mary Jo sighs)

240
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,657
- Wow, we're going to Missouri.

241
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:21,490
(Mary Jo chuckles)

242
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,323
- It's Montana.

243
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,412
- Oh, okay, wow, we're
going to Montana, ah!

244
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:29,790
(Mary Jo sighs)

245
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,297
You know, when we get
there we're gonna have to

246
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,710
get a house, like a brick one, you know,

247
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,650
like the smart little piggy did.

248
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,960
And of course, you'll have to build it

249
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,410
and I'll decorate it.

250
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,170
Oh, and we'll get lots
of friendly farm animals

251
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,020
like cows and chickens and sheep

252
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,200
and camels and pandas.

253
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,070
And there's the whole issue of kids.

254
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,257
Um, well at least two but
no more than 10, okay?

255
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:54,423
And that way we can live
happily, happily ever after.

256
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,400
Do you think I'm pretty?

257
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,233
- Yeah.

258
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,203
- Do you think I'm cute
pretty or pretty pretty?

259
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,160
- Look, are you gonna
talk the entire trip, huh?

260
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,937
I mean, the reading you warned me about,

261
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,357
but the questions--
- Fine.

262
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,273
Anyway, where were we?

263
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,440
- How old are you, 12?

264
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,590
- 36.

265
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,313
- 36, you're not 36.

266
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:30,663
What's this?

267
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,800
Mary Jo Tetelen from Houston, Texas.

268
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,040
Where did you get this?

269
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,873
- What do you mean?

270
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:40,706
It's legit, look.

271
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:41,539
Look at my picture, see?

272
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,020
Born March 6th and I'm a Pisces.

273
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,531
- That doesn't look anything like you.

274
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,690
- That is because I don't
photograph well, okay?

275
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,670
Look, I'm obviously
much cuter in real life

276
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,900
than I am in pictures or else I would've

277
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,733
been a model.

278
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,073
- No water.

279
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,674
No water.

280
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:06,230
We are going to follow the
rules of the road here.

281
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,200
- Rules of the road?

282
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,140
- Yes, the rules of the road.

283
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,320
Which means we only stop to get gas.

284
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,293
And we never, never stop to eat.

285
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,083
I knew it.

286
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,340
- And what exactly are
you doing over there, huh?

287
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,970
- I might as well since we had to stop

288
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,090
because your bladder was going to burst.

289
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,890
- Wait a second, I really
thought it was going to, okay?

290
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,520
- Put your seatbelt on.

291
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,470
- You know, you'd make a great husband.

292
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,773
You would.

293
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,080
I mean, I'm being completely serious.

294
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,260
The whole rules of the road, I mean,

295
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,060
that is so male.

296
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,063
It's a real turn on.

297
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,153
- Well then follow them, shit.

298
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,420
- You know, I can just
see you with your kids

299
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,250
on Christmas Day.

300
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,420
- I don't have any kids.

301
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,810
- Oh I know, I'm just when we do.

302
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,450
Well, when you do, with your wife

303
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,604
or whoever.

304
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:11,270
And I can just picture
you there with your son

305
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,520
in the driveway showing
him how to use his new

306
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,157
remote control car.

307
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:16,120
And you have this baseball hat on

308
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,436
and these flannel pajamas
with big fuzzy slippers.

309
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:19,960
(Mary Jo chuckles)

310
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,920
- Fuzzy slippers?

311
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,297
- Yeah, yeah, it's must what I see.

312
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:23,683
You know, I can't help it.

313
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,587
Oh and you know what?

314
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:26,730
There is something else.

315
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,420
Oh wait, yep, I'm seeing your wife.

316
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,140
And she's got like long brown hair.

317
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,600
Kinda like me.

318
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,940
And big blue eyes, kinda like me.

319
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,434
And a smile kinda like mine.

320
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:44,086
And well, in general, she's
looking a lot like me.

321
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:46,130
And she's looking on with love.

322
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:54,987
(Navy sighs)

323
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,987
(gentle rock music)

324
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:13,699
(bell dings)

325
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:16,949
- [Cook] Melly, pickup BLT.
- Thank you.

326
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:27,400
- All right, two corn dogs.

327
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,087
A fry and a root beer float.

328
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:33,920
- Is that three scoops?

329
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,753
- Three scoops.

330
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,943
- So what was the bonfire all about, huh?

331
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,463
- I didn't need my stuff anymore.

332
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,243
- You know, I've done this before.

333
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,283
- Done what?

334
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:59,135
- You know, just gone off with someone.

335
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,330
Except they were never serious, you know?

336
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:13,340
Where did you get a cool name like Navy?

337
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,173
- My mom.

338
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,570
Like sailors, booze, and one night stands.

339
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,133
Voila, here I am.

340
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,390
- So what happened to her?

341
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:36,920
- She left me at a department
store on my birthday.

342
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,776
And I never saw her again.

343
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:42,776
(Mary Jo laughing hysterically)

344
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,200
So what about your family?

345
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:51,484
- I don't have any.

346
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:52,317
- I figured.

347
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,760
So listen, about Montana.

348
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,593
- What?

349
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:00,316
- Well.

350
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,796
Why don't you just finish
what you're eatin',

351
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:15,173
so we can get back on the road?

352
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,700
Make sure you pee first.

353
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,325
- All right.

- [Mary Jo] It was tossed up.

363
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,560
A toy of the waves was thrown upon

364
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,023
the level sandy beach.

365
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,540
And now some part floats
amoat in the sunbeam.

366
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,190
Some part falls in a dew.

367
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,340
Some part has become a
happy, graceful flower.

368
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,110
And some part billows and
sweeps in the distant shores.

369
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,450
And today some part pours silent blessings

370
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,550
from that white cloud which drifts idly

371
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,810
in the high blue air far above your head.

372
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,643
The end.

373
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,563
- That's great.

374
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:42,820
- I have this uncontrollable urge to stick

375
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,773
my gum in your ear.

376
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,553
- That's great.

377
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,363
(Mary Jo giggles)

378
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:05,758
What are you doing?
- What?

379
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,656
What did you do that for?

380
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,496
(Mary Jo gasps)

381
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:09,888
Are you fucking crazy?

382
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:10,721
What, do you think it's fucking easy

383
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,110
to get coke in Utah?

384
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,943
God!

385
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,170
Asshole, asshole!

386
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:24,852
- That stuff will kill you, all right?

387
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:27,921
I know exactly how you feel.

388
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:30,575
Exactly.

389
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,314
- There.

390
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:47,911
- What, are you nuts?

391
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:48,965
- There!

392
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:50,066
There!

393
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:51,925
How does that feel?

394
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,100
There!
- No!

395
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,933
(tires squealing)

396
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:01,055
Shit.

397
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:03,891
- Huh, how does that feel?

398
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:05,058
Huh, ha ha ha.

399
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,472
How does it feel, huh?

400
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,500
How does it feel?

401
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,991
How does it feel?

402
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:11,672
Ha, serves you right.

403
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,644
Serves you right, stupid.

404
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,940
How does it feel, huh?

405
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,607
Monkey see, monkey do, ha ha ha.

406
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:21,415
Ha ha ha ha.

407
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:27,163
- Here's your shit.

408
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,640
Here's 200 bucks.

409
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,236
Do whatever you want.

410
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:34,530
Go back to Vegas, I don't care.

411
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,835
You are no longer my problem.

412
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:36,785
It's been fun, bye.

413
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,873
Shit.

414
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,930
All right, just start up the car

415
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,763
and drive away.

416
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:21,295
Come on, let's go.

417
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:22,795
- Did you miss me?

418
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:30,646
- Just uh, just get in the car.

419
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:45,592

I am, I really am.

426
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,274
- Don't worry about it.

427
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:21,374
It's only money, okay?

428
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,123

431
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,803
- I said, my real name is Rachel.

432
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,503

437
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,130
You've got to stop drinking so much water.

438
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,333

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,930
Rachel, is that--
- Hi Dad.

457
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,800
- Oh, what a surprise.

458
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,980
What a wonderful surprise.

459
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,813
Oh.

460
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,480
I've prayed to see your face again.

461
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,210
So many times.

462
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,043
Oh.

463
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,643

464
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,283
Dad, this is um, Navy.
- Navy.

465
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,388
Nice to meet you.

466
00:29:58,388 --> 00:29:59,763
- Nice to meet you, too.

467
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:00,596
- Well you're just in time for dinner.

468
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:01,660
Come on in.

00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,493
Come on in.

470
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,670
I gotta tell ya, I'm just so, so happy

471
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,580
that you came by.

472
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,540
Come on in.

473
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,373
That's fine, Navy.

474
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,482
Leave the door open, it's all right.

475
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:13,315
The house has changed a little bit

476
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:15,119
but it's still...

477
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,827
It's still the same place, you know?

478
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,330
Honey, I'd like ya to meet somebody.

479
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,330
Come on in this way.

480
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,730
Rachel, this is my wife, Joanne.

481
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,540
This is my daughter, Rachel.

482
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,480
- Hello.

483
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,960
- Joanne and I were married two years ago

484
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,450
in the temple.

485
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,700
Oh, and this is Joanne's
youngest one, Paige.

486
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,010
Honey, this is Rachel's friend, Navy.

487
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,570
And hopefully they're
gonna be staying with us

488
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,723
a night or two, okay?

489
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,310
- Please, we've got plenty of room.

490
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,023
- I'll be back.

491
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,810
I always kept an extra bed in here

492
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,423
just in case you ever came home.

493
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,680
Honey, you know, it's been six years.

494
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,530
You didn't really expect to find your room

495
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,860
exactly the way you left it, did ya?

496
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,693
Huh?

497
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:24,981
(spooky ambience)

498
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,148
- Billy, wait.

499
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,870
- Is Billy around?
- Oh yeah.

500
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,670
He got a girl pregnant, married her

501
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,180
and they live in some trailer park

502
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,303
the other end of town.

503
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:41,115
- You have not changed, have you, Dad?

504
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,230
- What?

505
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,730
- I said, you haven't changed.

506
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:08,983
- Hi.

507
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,450
- Hi.

508
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,060
- [Stan] Oh hi, Lilli.

509
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,730
That's Rachel's friend, Navy.

510
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,720
And this is my daughter, Rachel.

511
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,600
You remember, I told you about her?

512
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,433
- [Lilli] Yeah.

513
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:23,390
- This is Joanne's eldest daughter, Lilli.

514
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,223
- Hi.

515
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,660
- Lilli was the first
runner up in the Miss Utah

516
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,293
pageant last year.

517
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,533
- Mother, please.

518
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,347
- Well she was.

519
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:45,215
(carousel music)

520
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:58,991
Well, Joanne, would you
offer up the prayers

521
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:00,158
for this meal?

522
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,325
- Our dear kind and
gracious heavenly father.

523
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,040
We are so grateful for this day

524
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,743
and for all of our many blessings.

525
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,110
We are thankful for our family

526
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,940
and for our home.

527
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,420
And heavenly father at this time we ask

528
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,650
a special blessing that
will be strengthening

529
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,660
and nourishing to our bodies and that it

530
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,860
might do us the good that we need.

531
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,110
We pray for these things in the name

532
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,223
of our beloved son, Jesus Christ, amen.

533
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,147
- [All] Amen.

534
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:27,251
- Awesome.

535
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,084
- Everything looks wonderful.

536
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:29,573
Just great, honey, great job.

537
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,130
So where were you two headed?

538
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,690
- Montana.

539
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,921
- Oh Montana.

540
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:37,356
What's in Montana?

541
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:40,240
- Oh, Navy has a real bug home there.

542
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,150
It's kind of like a castle.

543
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,734
Could you please pass the potatoes?

544
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:43,567
- Oh it's not that big.

545
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,749
It's not a castle.

546
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:47,100
- So Navy, your job?

547
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,693
In Las Vegas, what were you in?

548
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,173
- Investments.

549
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,069
Financial investments, yeah.

550
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:55,902
- Hmm.

551
00:33:55,902 --> 00:33:56,930
Must be rewarding, huh?

552
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,823
- No, not as much as you think.

553
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,460
- Rachel, what exactly were you doing

554
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,710
in Las Vegas?

555
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,040
- [Stan] Honey, would you
pass the string beans, please?

556
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,863
- Actually, I was on my knees a lot.

557
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,760
You know, scrubbing floors,
kind of like Cinderella.

558
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,740
And then Navy found my
glass slipper and now

559
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,573
I'm a princess.

560
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,470
Where is the applesauce?

561
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,303
- Applesauce.

562
00:34:17,303 --> 00:34:18,490
Give her the applesauce.

563
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,851
Who's up for ham?

564
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,013
- I'll have some.

565
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:25,640
- [Stan] Okay, big slice, little slice.

566
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,580
- Big slice is great.

567
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,356
- [Stan] Big piece, little piece?

568
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,939
- [Navy] Big piece.
- All right.

569
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,913
- Hi.
- Hi.

570
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,750
- Do you have blankets and stuff?

571
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,950
- Oh yeah, I got enough.

572
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,390
So where's your real mom?

573
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,623
- She died a long time ago.

574
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,003
- Oh, sorry.

575
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,620
Listen, I'm gonna be...

576
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,793
I'm gonna be heading off tomorrow morning.

577
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,240
- Oh, okay, we're in a rush.

578
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,073
That's okay.

579
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,723
We'll leave tomorrow
morning then, that's fine.

580
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,100
- No, I'm going to be
heading off tomorrow morning

581
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,643
without you.

582
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,593
- What?

583
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,030
- Look, Rachel, I just gotta get going

584
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,300
and you got a lot to deal with here.

585
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,137
- No, no I don't.

586
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:28,060
Navy, I just brought you here so that

587
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,940
you could meet my dad and stuff.

588
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,942
I don't need to do anything.

589
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:33,893
- Rachel, you are not
listening to me, okay.

590
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,580
I'm leaving tomorrow morning by myself

591
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,513
like I planned.

592
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,573
Rachel?

593
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,600
- Can I turn off the light?

594
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,880
- It's your room.

595
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,243
Hey.

596
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,313
Do you always get what you pray for?

597
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,700
- Most of the time.

598
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,800
- Could you pray that Navy
won't leave me tomorrow?

599
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:52,911
- Sure.

600
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,204
(ignition clicking)

601
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:04,787
(gentle music)

602
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:12,365
(children chattering)

603
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,893
- [Navy] Well, the
mechanic says it'll take

604
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:34,600
about three days to get a part for my car.

605
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Said the starter was completely removed.

606
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,070
And just so you know, I know you did it.

607
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,903
- Did what?

608
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,960
- Look it, look it, if
you touch my car again--

609
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,240
- Yeah, yeah, you'll what?

610
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,800
You'll what?

611
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,700
I didn't do it, Navy.

612
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,420
Besides I knew you
weren't going to leave me

613
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,833
here anyway.

614
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,840
- Look, I never said
anything about taking you

615
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,180
to Montana.

616
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,280
I was waiting to do the right thing.

617
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,724
And leaving you here is
the right thing to do.

618
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:01,039
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,759
(man whistling)

620
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:03,592
- Let's go.

621
00:38:03,592 --> 00:38:05,810
- Look, look, those guys.

622
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,090
They call them tenters, they come here

623
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,493
about once a year, and
they camp in the mountains.

624
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:11,712
Hey.

625
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,545
(tenters cheering)

626
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:14,620
They're like gypsies, they
move from place to place.

627
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,123
- [Navy] Great.

628
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,250
- That's him, that's him.

629
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,600
I told you he was hot, huh?

630
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:36,720
Oh gosh, look how slutty she's dressed.

631
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,000
- Hey, you two, how you doing?

632
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,530
- Oh, pretty good.

633
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,860
- Lilli will be here
in a couple of minutes

634
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,050
to take your order, okay?

635
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,500
Have anything you want on me.

636
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:59,671
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, it's Jay.

637
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,704
Look at how clean cut he is.

638
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,490
- Yeah well he's been
home from his mission

639
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,450
for a couple of years now.

640
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,403
He married the Bishop's daughter, Peggy.

641
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:10,100
- Now that's really funny
because, see we used to

642
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,870
get stoned every Saturday
night behind the house

643
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,540
and he swore up and down
that he wouldn't go on one.

644
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,230
- Well Rachel, maybe
he's cleaned up his act.

645
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,610
- Hmm, too bad none of your kids

646
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,110
could've turned out that good.

647
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,960
- I've got to go.

648
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:30,230
- Well, they seem to be happy.

649
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,950
- Yeah, right.

650
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,980
Look at her.

651
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,813
She's a molly-queen.

652
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:35,550
She makes Marie Osmond look like Madonna.

653
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,333
All she used to say was, nice to see ya.

654
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,960
And, oh my heck.

655
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,380
You know what, a friendly word of advice.

656
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,280
Stay away from anybody who
ends a sentence with ya,

657
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,900
see ya, nice to meet ya.

658
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,630
Give me a break.

659
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,293
- Hey, what can I get ya?

660
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,694
(upbeat piano music)

661
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,970
- Back, yes and yes.

662
00:39:58,902 --> 00:40:00,735
Smile, enjoy yourself.

663
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:13,642
(Rachel sighs loudly)

664
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:17,508
Sweetheart, I think
that's enough for tonight.

665
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:19,911
Okay, why don't you run up and go to bed.

666
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:23,161
Goodnight, sweetheart.
- Goodnight, mom.

667
00:40:24,657 --> 00:40:27,740
(gentle piano music)

668
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,608
- You like chess, Lilli?

669
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,203
- I better go check the cookies.

670
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,370
- Yeah, you better do that.

671
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:58,705
(Rachel sighs)

672
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,530
So dad, you seen Billy lately?

673
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,310
- Yeah, a couple of days ago he was,

674
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,300
he was over here for something.

675
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,640
I don't know.

676
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,770
- Mm, why?

677
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,570
Doesn't he come over for dinner and chess?

678
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,740
- Rachel, don't start, okay?

679
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,133
- Stan, she likes to argue.

680
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,580
- Rachel, Billy's been sick.

681
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,648
And it's all I have to do is pray now.

682
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:30,873
So he can find his way back, all right?

683
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,253
- So that's why you never
came looking for me, huh?

684
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,313
Too busy praying.

685
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,210
Well your praying doesn't work.

686
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,780
- You're here aren't ya?

687
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,700
- I'm gonna go see Billy.

688
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,884
(gentle guitar music)

689
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:16,440
- [Billy] Oh my God.

690
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,465
Oh, my God.

691
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:19,672
(Rachel laughing)

692
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:20,569
Oh dude.

693
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:21,986
I cannot believe.

694
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,433
- Hey.
- Hi.

695
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:37,222
- Would you like a
cookie, it's fresh baked.

696
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,133
- Yeah, sure.

697
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,370
Thanks.

698
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,620
- You mind if I sit down?

699
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,793
- No, no, go ahead.

700
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,440
Best cookie I ever had.

701
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,273
- Yeah?

702
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,147
- So, how ya been?

703
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:04,299
- You know me.

704
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:06,925
I manage.

705
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:13,459
- Look, Rach.

706
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,103
Everybody knows.

707
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,683
They know what you were doing in Vegas.

708
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,590
- I don't care.

709
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,230
- You should never have sent that letter

710
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,063
to Sarah.

711
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,200
I mean, she has the biggest fucking mouth

712
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,496
in all of Fall Valley.

713
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,796
- That stupid bitch.

714
00:43:31,796 --> 00:43:33,446
- I mean, dad and me were a mess.

715
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:39,186
♪ Now it's time to face the music ♪

716
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:41,883
- He's got a whole new family now.

717
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,350
- Yeah.

718
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,183
- Lilli?

719
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,968
She was almost Miss Utah.

720
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:52,574
(both laughing)

721
00:43:52,574 --> 00:43:55,490
And Paige, Paige most definitely some day

722
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,920
will be...

723
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,870
- [Both] Miss Utah.

724
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,780
- You were runner up for Miss Utah?

725
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,080
- Yeah.

726
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,913
Yep.

727
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm a tomboy really, you know.

728
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,752
But my mom sort of turned me into

729
00:44:12,752 --> 00:44:14,043
this pageant girl, I guess.

730
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:18,723
- So did you ever meet
Regis and Kathie Lee?

731
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:21,793
- No, but I got to meet the Osmonds once.

732
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:25,901
It was great.

733
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:26,820
- I know.

734
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,770
- So you play any football or anything?

735
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,840
- Not since I was a little kid.

736
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,380
- No?

737
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,730
Well a bunch of us are playing tomorrow

738
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,830
if you'd like to play.

739
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:44,230
(Billy sighs)

740
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,214
- Dad tell you I have a little girl?

741
00:44:46,214 --> 00:44:47,600
- [Rachel] Yeah.

742
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,500
- She's beautiful.

743
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,433
Reminds me of you when you were little.

744
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:53,177
- Really?

745
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,663
- [Billy] Named her after mom.

746
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,077
- She wasn't perfect, Billy.

747
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:11,302
(Billy sighs)

748
00:45:11,302 --> 00:45:14,340
- [Billy] God, I'm glad you're back.

749
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,384
Look, I gotta go.

750
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:19,333
Walk.
- You walk?

751
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,166
- Yeah.

752
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:28,561
(background chatter)

753
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:39,846
- [man] Get him, Rachel.

754
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:56,005
(glass shattering)

755
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:58,838
(Rachel coughing)

756
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:03,031
- What's going on?

757
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:04,864
- [Stan] I don't know.

758
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,170
- [Navy] Listen uh--

759
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,751
- [Stan] Oh, my God.

760
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:11,013
- [Navy] I'll clean her up
and put her to bed, okay?

761
00:46:11,013 --> 00:46:11,846
(Rachel moans)

762
00:46:11,846 --> 00:46:12,679
Come on, it's okay.

763
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:14,505
Sorry.

764
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,395
(Rachel giggling)

765
00:46:22,395 --> 00:46:23,228
Come on.

766
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,151
- [Rachel] Wait.

767
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:27,984
(Rachel vomiting)

768
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:32,661
- It's okay, (mumbling).

769
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:34,158
Come on, come on.

770
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,116
(Navy groaning)

771
00:46:36,116 --> 00:46:36,958
There you go.

772
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,018
- [Rachel] Bye.

773
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:39,231
- [Joanne] Girls, I
want you to go upstairs

774
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:40,219
and go to bed now.

775
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:41,151
- We're going.

776
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,210
- I know, (mumbling).

777
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,910
A bad spirit came into this house

778
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,521
the moment she got here.

779
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:50,093
- [Rachel] Whoa, a bad
spirit in this house.

780
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:52,700
(Rachel laughing)

781
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,886
- I'm gonna clean it up.

782
00:46:56,886 --> 00:46:59,886
- [Rachel] Clean it up, clean it up.

783
00:47:09,122 --> 00:47:10,622
- [Child] Come on.

784
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,263
- Oh, I feel like shit.

785
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,260
Nice doilies.

786
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,973
- Thanks, I love this dress.

787
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:25,340
- [Rachel] Are you wearing that to school?

788
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,223
- No, it's 3:30.

789
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,830
I'm going to ward flag football game.

790
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:34,663
You wanna come?

791
00:47:36,613 --> 00:47:38,047
- Oh, can I please?

792
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,313
Hey.

793
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,553
I'm sorry.

794
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,450
- Well, Navy's playing.

795
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,822
(gentle music)

796
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:01,749
(background chatter)

797
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:26,093
(crowd cheering)

798
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,441
- [Rachel] Hey Navy.

799
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:36,996
- Here, I'll be right there.

800
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,898
- [Female] Okay, clean it
up guys, we're up 14-7.

801
00:48:38,898 --> 00:48:40,480
Come on.

802
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,530
- Look, I'm sorry about last night, okay?

803
00:48:43,693 --> 00:48:45,603
They just kept handing me those shots.

804
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:48,663
- It's okay, I understand.

805
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:53,797
- Well, it looks like you're
really fitting in here.

806
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,899
- Well the people are friendly, you know?

807
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,547
- Oh yeah.

808
00:48:57,547 --> 00:48:59,283
- Hey Navy, we're back on offense.

809
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:01,940
- I bet they are.

810
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,773
- Just a second.

811
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:05,692
You wanna play?

812
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,583
- Yeah, right.

813
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,593
Um, listen.

814
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,380
Billy and some of his
friends are getting together

815
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,500
tonight at the bar to
play pool, and well Billy

816
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,250
really wanted to meet you,
you know, so you wanna come?

817
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,045
- Yeah, sure, why not?

818
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:31,388
See ya.
- See ya tonight.

819
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:32,221
- Wait up.

820
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,123
- Nice shot, would you like a shot?

821
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:48,883
- Yeah.

822
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,248
So, what should we drink to?

823
00:49:55,248 --> 00:49:56,252
- [Rachel] Me.

824
00:49:56,252 --> 00:49:57,770
- You, welcome home.

825
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,990
- We're leaving in a
couple days, right Navy?

826
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,927
Are you gonna tell Lilli about us?

827
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:19,697
Or am I going to have to?

828
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:22,329
- What are you talking about?

829
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:25,329

870
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:27,973
Had enough?

871
00:52:34,253 --> 00:52:36,126

873
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,012

874
00:52:42,012 --> 00:52:43,095
Are you okay?

875
00:52:58,127 --> 00:52:59,880
- You stay away from me.

876
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,713
- What?

877
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:05,820
- You get away from me
and never touch me again.

878
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,443
- What is your problem?

879
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,850
- What is my problem?

880
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,160
Are you kidding?

881
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,010
My nose feels like it's broken.

882
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,540
But that is not my problem.

883
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,610
You are my fucking problem.

884
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,150
You are.

885
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:23,200
- It's not my fault that you can't fight.

886
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:29,290
- Fuck you, Rachel, fuck you!

887
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,918
You know what?

888
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:33,230
I am through with your
immature fucking shit.

889
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,270
All the drugs, you know, all the flirting,

890
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,900
and all that prince and princesses

891
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,887
in a castle in Montana,
it's fucking bullshit

892
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:42,183
and you're bullshit.

893
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:44,953
And you fucking know it.

894
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:48,483
- I'm sorry.

895
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,089
- Well you know what?

896
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:53,097
You know what?

897
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:55,350
I forgive you, now leave me alone.

898
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,283
Leave me alone.

899
00:53:59,764 --> 00:54:02,847
(background chatter)

900
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,543
- Navy, are you okay?

901
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,833
Oh my heck.

902
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,223
Did somebody hit you?

903
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,913
- Yeah.

904
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:22,702
- Let me see.

905
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:24,484
Oh, I'm sorry.

906
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,643
You poor thing, let me look.

907
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,240
Are you okay?

908
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,290
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

909
00:54:35,617 --> 00:54:38,463
- Do you want any aspirin or anything?

910
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,870
So you'll be okay then?

911
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,883
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine, thanks.

912
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,313
- Well, I better get to bed.

913
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,920
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

914
00:55:02,676 --> 00:55:05,873
- Did you want me to shut
the light off for ya?

915
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,793
- Yeah.

916
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,180
- Navy, I don't...

917
00:56:01,312 --> 00:56:04,379
- You bitch, you fucking bitch.

918
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:05,546
Get off of me.

919
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,420
I fucking hate you.

920
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,677
- What is wrong with you?

921
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:12,468
- I'm sorry.

922
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:13,301
- It's all right.

923
00:56:15,553 --> 00:56:18,331
(Navy groaning)

924
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,914
(gentle music)

925
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,193
- Hey.

926
00:56:47,496 --> 00:56:48,829
Can I get a hit?

927
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:54,502
- What's your name?

928
00:56:55,943 --> 00:56:56,776
- Mary Jo.

929
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,587
(whimsical music)

930
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:28,279
(Rachel crying)

931
00:57:39,935 --> 00:57:42,935
- [Mother] Billy, Rachel, come here.

932
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,629
(woeful music)

933
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,534
(gunshot)

934
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:44,560
- I cleared out the basement for ya.

935
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,483
So if you decide that you'd
like to stay, you can.

936
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:51,469
(gentle piano music)

937
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,630
You're thinking about Rachel, huh?

938
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:56,463
- Yeah.

939
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:02,043
I um, I just feel bad about last night.

940
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,383
I didn't mean to hurt her like that.

941
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:09,823
I don't know.

942
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:12,883
I just don't know what to do.

943
00:59:50,114 --> 00:59:51,635
- [Lilli] That's the temple.

944
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:52,530
- [Navy] I've never seen anything like it.

945
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,580
- No?
- Hmm-mm.

946
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:55,410
- Hm.

947
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:01,090
Oh, you know, I'll only
get married in a temple.

948
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,040
- You have to be a Mormon to be married

949
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,873
in the temple?

950
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,570
- Yeah.

951
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,930
Most of my friends are married, you know.

952
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,330
And they say it's wonderful.

953
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,468
- What's wonderful?

954
01:00:12,468 --> 01:00:13,823
- Being married.

955
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,370
I can barely wait.

956
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:19,203
- Yeah.

957
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:24,770
- So, would you, would you like to know

958
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:25,933
more about the church?

959
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,743
- Don't stop, you look wonderful.

960
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:40,173
- Yeah, this isn't exactly
my kind of dancing, you know?

961
01:00:41,278 --> 01:00:42,723
- Well, I can show you.

962
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,395
Third, your heel touches
the inside of your foot.

963
01:00:46,395 --> 01:00:49,876
This arm comes up, and this is down.

964
01:00:49,876 --> 01:00:51,800
Fourth, your foot slides up.

965
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,543
And we change arms.

966
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,242
And fifth, you heel touches your toe.

967
01:00:57,242 --> 01:00:59,819
And back, ta-da.
- Ta-da.

968
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,486
(both laughing)

969
01:01:04,743 --> 01:01:07,690
So, have you seen Navy?

970
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,070
- Yeah, he's with Lilli.

971
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,940
They're picking up the car.

972
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:11,773
- Oh.

973
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:13,670
You know, I betcha anything that Lilli's

974
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,470
the one that messed with Navy's car.

975
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,243
- I took auto shop last year.

976
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,173
- [Rachel] Now you're it, you're it.

977
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:35,890
- [Paige] It's a coin
my grandfather gave me.

978
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,890
He said it's from the ancient Lamenites.

979
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,880
It'll grant you what you wish.

980
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,530
Any wish imaginable.

981
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,830
If you just throw it on
water that lays still.

982
01:01:46,096 --> 01:01:48,173
I want you to have it.

983
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,164
- Oh, Paige, I can't, I--

984
01:01:51,164 --> 01:01:51,997
- Please.

985
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:56,139
- All right.

986
01:01:57,722 --> 01:02:00,322
Does this mean I can
consider you my sister?

987
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:01,442
- Of course.
- Yeah.

988
01:02:01,442 --> 01:02:03,054
- I am your sister.
- Okay.

989
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:06,721
(gentle instrumental music)

990
01:03:50,037 --> 01:03:53,204
(audience applauding)

991
01:04:02,158 --> 01:04:02,991
Hi.
- Hi.

992
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:09,647
She was really good, wasn't she?

993
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:11,637
- Yeah, yeah she was.

994
01:04:11,637 --> 01:04:14,720
(upbeat piano music)

995
01:04:16,476 --> 01:04:18,403
- You're really falling for her, right?

996
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,280
Just tell me you're not
gonna do this to me.

997
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:27,520
Tell me that you're not
gonna move into my house

998
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,530
and marry my evil stepsister and live

999
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,340
happily ever after in my own backyard.

1000
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,526
Okay, just say you're not gonna break

1001
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:35,109
my heart like that.

1002
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:36,759
Navy, I have my problems, I know.

1003
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:40,360
In the bar the other night, I just,

1004
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,780
I wanted you to have
to save me like before.

1005
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,163
- Rachel, forget about it.

1006
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,830
This has nothing to do with the bar.

1007
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:48,630
- Then why are you doing this to me?

1008
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,190
I thought you were gonna
go to Montana, Navy.

1009
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,950
You know, this isn't Montana.

1010
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:53,813
It's Utah.

1011
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,279
- Maybe, maybe this is Montana.

1012
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:09,083
Maybe Montana was just a
thing I was looking for.

1013
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,260
- Then why did you come back for me?

1014
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,510
- For a million different reasons.

1015
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:23,750
But not the one you're looking for

1016
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,583
and I'm sorry.

1017
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,039
I'm sorry.

1018
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:32,883
(sorrowful music)

1019
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:01,728
- Aren't you a little
old to be hanging out

1020
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:02,561
in playgrounds?

1021
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:08,750
And I'm sorry about the other night.

1022
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,100
Friends got a little rowdy.

1023
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,023
My name is Cole.

1024
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,700
Those guys over there monkeying around,

1025
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,003
that's G and Samantha.

1026
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,683
They're harmless.

1027
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:21,663
They just like to party a lot.

1028
01:06:24,139 --> 01:06:26,726
- So you guys are, you're tenters right?

1029
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,726
- Tenters, that's what you guys call us?

1030
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,260
Well I prefer to be called fucked up, but,

1031
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,910
tenters does have a nice ring to it.

1032
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,223
My God, you smiled.

1033
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,380
What a beautiful smile.

1034
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:39,823
You did it again.

1035
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,603
So uh, you gonna sit
here and swing all day?

1036
01:06:52,457 --> 01:06:54,570
Why don't you come with us?

1037
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:56,580
We're having like a
little rave at the camp.

1038
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,413
It's great.

1039
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:02,999
You never raved before, have you?

1040
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,000
- Hmm-mm.

1041
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,694
I don't even know what it is.

1042
01:07:05,694 --> 01:07:06,562
What is it?

1043
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:07,785
- You know what?

1044
01:07:07,785 --> 01:07:08,618
Why don't you come with us.

1045
01:07:08,618 --> 01:07:09,630
I'll show you.

1046
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:10,463
It's real easy.

1047
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,600
It's like, it's kind of like dancing

1048
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,312
but, well I'll show ya.

1049
01:07:14,312 --> 01:07:15,290
You'll like it.

1050
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,713
I got your sweater.

1051
01:07:16,713 --> 01:07:18,338
I'm watching it.

1052
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:20,921
(gentle music)

1053
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:59,250
Yeah, yeah, it's beautiful here, isn't it?

1054
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,393
- Yeah.

1055
01:08:00,393 --> 01:08:04,260
- If I were to kill
myself, uh, I'd kill myself

1056
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,573
right here.

1057
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,810
I'd want this to be the
last thing I ever saw.

1058
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:12,663
Listen to this.

1059
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:15,464
You'll like this.

1060
01:08:17,565 --> 01:08:20,216
Help me!

1061
01:08:20,216 --> 01:08:22,133
(echo)

1062
01:08:24,616 --> 01:08:25,449
Did you hear that?

1063
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,560
Yeah, it's my own fucking voice

1064
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,993
bouncing off the rocks, mocking me.

1065
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:35,436
(Cole sighs)

1066
01:08:35,436 --> 01:08:36,320
All right.

1067
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,370
Go ahead, you try.

1068
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,653
Scream, scream help me.

1069
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:47,727
- Help me!

1070
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:50,892
(echo)

1071
01:08:50,892 --> 01:08:53,725
(Rachel laughing)

1072
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:57,427
Wow, I like it here.

1073
01:08:57,427 --> 01:08:59,221
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1074
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:00,849
- I'm glad you dig it.

1075
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:02,804
You look a little nippy.

1076
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,722
Here is my coat.

1077
01:09:05,722 --> 01:09:08,397
(upbeat rock music)

1078
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:11,480
(background chatter)

1079
01:09:19,433 --> 01:09:20,266
This is my family.

1080
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:23,587
I feel safe here.

1081
01:09:23,587 --> 01:09:25,887
I never really felt safe
growing up, you know?

1082
01:09:27,146 --> 01:09:28,043
- Yes, I do.

1083
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:30,250
- I hated my real family.

1084
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,100
I'm gonna go see my family.

1085
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,933
- Hey.

1086
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,806
Thanks for this.

1087
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:39,120
I've been having a really nice time.

1088
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,634
- Hey, we're leaving tomorrow morning

1089
01:09:42,634 --> 01:09:44,261
going to Wyoming.

1090
01:09:44,261 --> 01:09:46,363
You can come if you promise me two things.

1091
01:09:47,888 --> 01:09:49,314
- Yeah, what?

1092
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:53,953
- One, you smile for
me at least once a day.

1093
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,980
And two, once you join us,
you gotta stay with us.

1094
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,755
You can never leave.

1095
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:02,947
That is our pact.

1096
01:10:02,947 --> 01:10:06,003
If you decide to go meet
me at your swing at nIne.

1097
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,833
Come on.

1098
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,590
You just gotta close your eyes and move

1099
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:12,590
your head real slow.

1100
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:14,712
It's real easy actually.

1101
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:15,640
It's kind of crazy.

1102
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,157
Just be careful, these
people are very physical

1103
01:10:18,157 --> 01:10:19,368
around here.

1104
01:10:19,368 --> 01:10:20,479
You have to put yourself
in here like that.

1105
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:21,845
Yeah, there you go.

1106
01:10:21,845 --> 01:10:24,064
There we go, yeah, oh.

1107

(knocking at door)

1109
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,510
- Hi, Jed.

1110
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:44,900
- Hi, Stan, how are ya?

1111
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,320
- What's the matter?

1112
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,010
- Sorry to bother ya but the gentleman

1113
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,410
that's staying with you
is driving a stolen car

1114
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,880
and it belongs to this lady.

1115
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,852
- What?

1116
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:53,685
Stolen?
- Navy!

("Space Age Love Song"
by A Flock of Seagulls)

1118
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:14,681
- Lilli, I'm not who you think I am.

1119
01:11:18,593 --> 01:11:20,760
I have a lot of skeletons.

1120
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,680
- Navy, me too, I mean, when I was 13,

1121
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,020
one time I, I smoked
cigarettes for two weeks

1122
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,020
and one time my parents went out of town

1123
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,563
and I got really drunk.

1124
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,190
And I almost had sex with
this black football player

1125
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:41,313
at Dixie College.

1126
01:11:45,397 --> 01:11:47,530
- I've done a lot worse.

1127
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,210
If you only knew.

1128
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:51,440
- Navy, please don't make fun of me, okay?

1129
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,910
If any of my friends knew that I did

1130
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,260
half of the stuff, they would never talk

1131
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,093
to me again.

1132
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,400
- I need to tell ya what
I was doing in Vegas.

1133
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,633
- I don't wanna know.

1134
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:07,583
And I don't care.

1135
01:12:10,556 --> 01:12:13,061
All I care about is how
I feel about you, Navy.

1136
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:14,590

1137
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:15,743

What's up?

1146

You did not tell anybody.

01:13:38,617 --> 01:13:40,303
You just left!

1154
01:13:41,862 --> 01:13:42,993
That's so rude.

1155
01:13:46,892 --> 01:13:50,203

1156
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,230
I'm sorry.

1157
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,308

You are sorry.

1160

I called every damn police
officer in the world

I didn't buy you that fucking car

1164

1168
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:29,472
tonight, okay?

1169
01:14:29,472 --> 01:14:30,305
Come on.

1170
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,220
- I'm not going back.

1171

1172
01:14:36,053 --> 01:14:38,063

Who are you without me, hm?

1177
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:59,760
You are the same punk teenager

1178
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,080
who stood on the street corners soliciting

1179
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,933
dirty old men.

1180
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,390
I took you off the streets.

1181
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:12,270

Now let's get going and that is final.

1184
01:15:21,294 --> 01:15:24,240

1185
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,620
I don't care if you
take every penny I have,

you can keep the car and
take the car, I don't care.

You made a promise, remember?

1257
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:42,090
You haven't smiled all day.

01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:44,978
It's okay, I'll just go.

1268
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:46,433
- No, no, no, wait a minute there.

1269
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,496
I said don't leave.

1270
01:24:50,496 --> 01:24:52,246
You don't just leave.

All right first, now we steal your money.

1274
01:25:05,508 --> 01:25:07,999
- [Samantha] There's no money, Cole.

1275
01:25:07,999 --> 01:25:08,832
- Now you know what, since you don't

1276
01:25:08,832 --> 01:25:10,545
have any money, well...

1277
01:25:10,545 --> 01:25:12,886
I will fuck you up the ass.

1278
01:25:12,886 --> 01:25:16,963
And finally, you know, I
will blow your brains out.

1279
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:20,423
And you wanted to leave after only being

1280
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:22,630
a third done with the ceremony.

1281
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:23,470
Shame on you!

1282
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:24,707
Bad, bad, bad!

1283
01:25:29,066 --> 01:25:34,066
- Come on.

1284
01:25:37,241 --> 01:25:40,408
(police siren blares)

1285
01:25:47,854 --> 01:25:48,690
- Oh my God.

1286
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:50,290
Oh I do have a surprise for you.

1287
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:53,511
Look who has been looking for you.

1288
01:25:53,511 --> 01:25:55,078
- Paige, what are you doing here?

1289
01:25:55,078 --> 01:25:56,479
- I had to find you.

1290
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:57,533
- Okay you guys.

1291
01:25:57,533 --> 01:25:59,590
Let her go, let her go, okay, she's just

1292
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:00,423
a little girl, okay?

1293
01:26:00,423 --> 01:26:01,780
Just let her go, let her go, please.

1294
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,193
- Would you shut the fuck up?

1295
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,965
- [G] Hey what you got under that dress?

1296
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:11,141
- Get away from her.

1297
01:26:11,141 --> 01:26:12,634
- Get back, get back, hey.

1298
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:13,770
Get back, hey, hey, hey.

1299
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:15,950
You know what?

1300
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,100
Let's get them out of here.

1301
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,517
Come on, come on.

1302
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,787
(intense music)

1303
01:26:40,869 --> 01:26:42,650
- [Rachel] Could you
pull over, I need to pee.

1304
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,742
- [Cole] Oh, you need to pee.

1305
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:45,575
Oh well.

1306
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:53,113
- Paige, you need to go too, right?

1307
01:26:56,071 --> 01:26:57,480
(Paige crying)

1308
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,430
- [Cole] Now hurry.

1309
01:27:07,395 --> 01:27:09,062
Are your shoes tied?

1310
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,820
- Yeah, of course.

1311
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:15,073
This is the best part.
- Oh yeah?

1312
01:27:31,187 --> 01:27:33,634
(Paige crying)

1313
01:27:33,634 --> 01:27:35,034
- Hey.

1314
01:27:35,034 --> 01:27:36,516
- I'm so scared.

1315
01:27:36,516 --> 01:27:37,349
- Listen to me.

1316
01:27:37,349 --> 01:27:38,435
- We're gonna die.

1317
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:40,003
- Sh, listen to me, listen to me, okay?

1318
01:27:40,003 --> 01:27:41,317
- We're gonna die.

1319
01:27:41,317 --> 01:27:42,350
- No, we're not gonna die.

1320
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,557
We're not gonna die.

1321
01:27:43,557 --> 01:27:44,390
I need you to look at me.

1322
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,223
Look at me!

1323
01:27:45,223 --> 01:27:46,433
You are not going to die.

1324
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:47,330
- Yes, I am.

1325
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,163
- You're not.

1326
01:27:48,163 --> 01:27:48,996
Look at the mountains.

1327
01:27:48,996 --> 01:27:50,203
Look at the mountains.

1328
01:27:50,203 --> 01:27:51,036
We're gonna run, okay?

1329
01:27:51,036 --> 01:27:52,140
You and I, we're gonna do it together.

1330
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:52,973
We're gonna run.

1331
01:27:52,973 --> 01:27:53,806
We're gonna run and
we're gonna keep running

1332
01:27:53,806 --> 01:27:54,639
no matter what happens.

1333
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,535
Whatever happens, you keep running.

1334
01:27:56,535 --> 01:27:57,368
(Paige crying)

1335
01:27:57,368 --> 01:27:58,201
Okay?

1336
01:27:58,201 --> 01:27:59,034
We can do it.

1337
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,824
Okay?

1338
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:04,070
Okay, you ready?

1339
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,210
Come on.

1340
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:09,510
One, two, three, go, go, go.

1341
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:12,295
Go!

1342
01:28:12,295 --> 01:28:13,695
- There they go!

1343
01:28:13,695 --> 01:28:14,528
Whew!

Run, Paige, run, keep running.

1352
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:52,504
Don't look back, okay?

1353
01:28:52,504 --> 01:28:53,460
I'm right behind you.

1354
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,293
Keep running.

(G yelping)

1356
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,420

1357
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,977
Come on.

1358
01:29:13,977 --> 01:29:16,644

(G laughing)

1360
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:32,053

and go get the Molly.

- Rachel!

1364
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:00,974
- I liked you.

1365
01:30:00,974 --> 01:30:05,974
I thought you were one of us.

1366
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,552
- Come here, cutie.

1367
01:30:08,552 --> 01:30:09,410
(Paige screaming)
- Leave me alone.

1368
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:12,247
- Let's us dance now, come on.

1369
01:30:12,247 --> 01:30:13,080
(Paige screaming)

1370
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,080
(G laughing evilly)

1371
01:30:17,374 --> 01:30:19,188
- [Cole] Hey.

1373
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,503
Hey.

1374
01:30:23,507 --> 01:30:26,681
Fucking answer me when
I talk to you, girl.

1375
01:30:26,681 --> 01:30:27,514
Get up.

1376
01:30:28,445 --> 01:30:30,114
God, you are pretty.

That was bad.

(gun cocks)

1382
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:03,914
There's no place like home.

- Oh, my God.

1386
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:13,527
Only one bullet in there, I forgot.

1393
01:31:39,844 --> 01:31:41,194
Get the fuck out of here.

1394
01:31:41,194 --> 01:31:44,051

1395
01:31:44,051 --> 01:31:44,884
It's okay.

1396
01:31:44,884 --> 01:31:45,920
(Paige crying)

Paige, are you okay?

1400
01:31:50,433 --> 01:31:51,725
You're going to be okay.

1401
01:31:51,725 --> 01:31:53,422
Where's Rachel, huh?

01:31:53,422 --> 01:31:54,930
(gunshot)

1403
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:56,627
Billy, come here.

1404
01:31:56,627 --> 01:31:57,771
Stay her with her, okay?

1405
01:31:57,771 --> 01:31:58,711
- I got her.

1406
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:00,461
It's okay, it's okay.

(water sloshing)

1408
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,393
- [Navy] Rachel.

1409
01:32:48,698 --> 01:32:50,281
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1410
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:51,993
Are you okay?

Where's Paige?

- Paige?

1414
01:33:05,973 --> 01:33:07,450
Paige is with Billy, it's okay.

1415
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:09,683
Hey, she's gonna be all right.

1416
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:13,263
It's all right.

1417
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,543
Come on, let's go, all right?

1418
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:19,510
Let's get out of here.

(gentle music)

1420
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,993
- Hi.
- Hi.

1421
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:09,558
- So how much longer?

1422
01:34:09,558 --> 01:34:12,225
- It's right over this mountain.

1423
01:34:13,156 --> 01:34:14,753
- What are we gonna do when we get there?

1424
01:34:18,305 --> 01:34:19,555
- I don't know.

1425
01:34:30,804 --> 01:34:31,637
There.

1426
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:35,813
(gentle music)

1427
01:35:09,673 --> 01:35:11,506
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1428

01:35:32,023 --> 01:35:34,856
(mid tempo music)

1431
01:38:56,277 --> 01:38:57,785
- You bettin' on the fight, man?

1432
01:38:57,785 --> 01:38:59,231
- I put a couple hundred on it.

1433
01:38:59,231 --> 01:39:00,930
(laughing)

1434
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:02,452
- What's up, man?

1435
01:39:02,452 --> 01:39:04,410
- What's up, Jay?

1436
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:05,760
- I got a letter from Navy.

1437
01:39:07,848 --> 01:39:10,460
There's no return address
but it's postmarked Montana.

1438
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:13,410
- Like a pig farm.

1439
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:15,110
- It says to open it at the table.

1440
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:18,920
- Yeah, how long has it
been since he's been gone?

1441
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,433
- Almost four years, yeah.

1442
01:39:21,578 --> 01:39:22,411
What's it say?

1443
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:34,073
- It says, there is more to life, Navy.

1444
01:39:36,734 --> 01:39:38,401
That's all he wrote.

1445
01:39:48,787 --> 01:39:50,870
- He has kids.

1446
01:40:02,734 --> 01:40:04,151
- He looks happy.

1447
01:40:09,431 --> 01:40:11,181
Man, that's touching.

1448
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:16,663
(background chatter)
