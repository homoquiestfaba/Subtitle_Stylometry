1
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,426
Invite only, make way.

2
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,526
Good evening, ladies.

3
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,913
Have fun.

4
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,440
What's up, man?

5
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,550
Hey.

6
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,795
Awesome, boy.

7
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,382
Hey, label guys.

8
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:47,951
Atomic Records, I think.

9
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,886
Dude, you know that is not the first,

10
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:52,155
but the second group this week?

11
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,725
Man, you're getting a deal
real soon, real soon.

12
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:57,727
Come on, how do these guys sell music...

13
00:02:57,827 --> 00:03:01,564
...  when they don't got inch of
rhythm in their entire body?

14
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,894
Nah, I'm way too sober for this. Here.

15
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,271
I had one already.

16
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,371
All right, have half.

17
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,746
Yeah, man.

18
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,915
Yo, hold down the fort.

19
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:22,330
I'm gonna show these kids
how it's done.

20
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,922
Joshy boy.

21
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:28,022
Hey, you got this.

22
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:09,732
Baby, why don't you wash
that shirt soon?

23
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,036
'Cause then it won't smell like I work there.

24
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,238
I'm sure employees
that actually work there...

25
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,209
...     wash their uniforms
every once in a while.

26
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,311
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

27
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,146
Of course.

28
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,246
Good.

29
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,839
...and guaranteed moisture repellent,

30
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,575
your friends will think
you paid thousands...

31
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,611
...  for your new kitchen.

32
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,614
But at Cabinets To Go,
prices start at $995...

33
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,618
...for 10 feet of upper and lower
solid wood cabinets.

34
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,203
Call now for a free catalogue at 1-800...

35
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,592
...     Man, I passed out last night.

36
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,394
Did we talk?

37
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,129
No.

38
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,563
What time did you get home?

39
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,966
Around four.

40
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,334
Why so late?

41
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,835
We had a sewage problem at work.

42
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,404
Had to clean the floors.

43
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,272
They don't have private
companies or something...

44
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:59,092
...that takes care of that shit?

45
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,127
There's no milk?

46
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,639
Hey.

47
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,341
You are on fire.

48
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,042
I have a treat for you.

49
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,142
Oh, yeah?

50
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,795
Whoo, man.

51
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,897
It is a party tonight.

52
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,299
Yeah.

53
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,633
Here you go.

54
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:58,901
I had two already.

55
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,570
Whoa, whoa,
this ain't Molly.

56
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,838
What is it?

57
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,706
Something tight.

58
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,641
This will take you
to the moon and back,

59
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,343
and you ain't even gonna blink.

60
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:08,544
I don't know, man.

61
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:09,679
Oh, come on.

62
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,049
and I'm telling you, Pandora
has landed on my brain.

63
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,650
So, whatever you're doing
right here, Joshy boy,

64
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,895
it's about to get a whole lot faster.

65
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,896
Ah, ha-ha.

66
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,931
All right, you got to buckle up
'cause we're about to lift off,

67
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,667
and we're all coming with you.

68
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,219
Yeah, Joshy boy.

69
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,268
Paging Dr. Bedford.

70
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:15,287
Paging Dr. Bedford, please.

71
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,450
Are you his--...

72
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,818
...  I'm his mother, yes.
What happened?

73
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,286
He overdosed.

74
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:31,854
We flushed his stomach.
He's stable.

75
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,389
I'm going to let him rest for a bit,

76
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,294
and I'll come check on him later.

77
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,414
Damn it, Josh.

78
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,386
God.

79
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:57,813
You just got us both
in a whole load of trouble.

80
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,913
Damn it.

81
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,661
Good morning, sleepy head.

82
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,829
Your mother signed the release
before she left.

83
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,281
Said she had to go to work.

84
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,341
Do you understand how screwed
we are right now?

85
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:28,331
No, you don't.
You don't even care.

86
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,747
You have to stand in front
of a judge next week.

87
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,950
I don't even know how I'm going
to pay for an attorney.

88
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,851
I don't get paid until Friday.

89
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:39,404
Josh, I know you can hear me.

90
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,146
Josh. Josh.

91
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,467
Mr. Harvest, despite all your priors,

92
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,538
that include disorderly conduct,
drug possession, forgery,

93
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,975
identity theft, vandalism,

94
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,444
despite all of that,
this court has decided...

95
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,646
...not to inflict any more pain
on your mother...

96
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,550
...with any kind of prison time
on your person.

97
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,321
However, you will have to submit
to drug rehabilitation...

98
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,391
...and professional counselling
for a period of 12 months.

99
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:18,327
But with your mother's busy schedule,

100
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,230
and given that you are still
a minor in need of supervision,

101
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,232
this court cannot take the chance...

102
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,334
...  you will fail to meet these requirements.

103
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,339
Your mother has informed me that
your father, Jim T. Wallace,

104
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,276
is alive and well, and has
agreed to look after you...

105
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:37,079
... for the remainder of your 17th year,

106
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,915
and/or until you comply
with this court's order,

107
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,651
whichever comes later.

108
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,419
Failure to comply with all
of these requirements...

109
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,255
...will result in your arrest,

110
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,324
at which point the court will
determine your punishment...

111
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:49,759
...in accordance with state law.

112
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,694
Is that understood?

113
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,929
Yeah.

114
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,999
'Yes, Your Honour.'

115
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,869
Yes, Your Honour.

116
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,519
Good, this court is adjourned.

117
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,680
Hey.

118
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,782
It's clean.

119
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,884
Could have done that myself.

120
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,534
Been doing it for a while now.

121
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,226
Listen to me, I just can't do
this alone anymore.

122
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,162
Do what?

123
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,563
Take care of your son?

124
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,964
You haven't been doing it alone.

125
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:30,132
You haven't been doing it at all.

126
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,068
What are you talking about?

127
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,969
I have been here for you
since your father split.

128
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,404
Did you forget that?

129
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,839
For me?

130
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,541
You can't even make rent.

131
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:39,742
There's never food in the fridge.

132
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,843
I buy my own clothes.
Hey.

133
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:41,844
When have you been there for me?

134
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,312
Hey.

135
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,081
I stopped doing drugs for you.

136
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,149
It wasn't easy,
but I did it for you.

137
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,318
Yeah, that's a good one.

138
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,654
What do you want from me?

139
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,255
Nothing.

140
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,824
I don't want anything from you.

141
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,924
Not anymore.

142
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,833
Why are you crying?

143
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,788
'Cause I'm sick and tired
of you blaming me...

144
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,590
...for everything that's happened
in your life, okay?

145
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,026
Are you serious?

146
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,362
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

147
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,030
You might just be the most
selfish person I know.

148
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,699
Selfish?

149
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,933
You want hear about selfish?

150
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,668
I didn't even want to have you.

151
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,879
Your dad, he--...

152
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,449
...   he convinced me,
making all these promises.

153
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,720
So, I did it for him
because he wanted you,

154
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,422
and I loved him, okay?

155
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,522
And then, he split.

156
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,727
He wasn't even there the day
you were born 'cause he split.

157
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,428
He just left us,

158
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:09,331
so don't make me the bad guy
in this story, okay?

159
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,733
Don't.

160
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:15,553
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm not a bad guy.

161
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,285
Josh.

162
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,526
Hi, I'm Jim.

163
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,132
Come on, let's go.

164
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,065
So, how was your trip?

165
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,165
It was all right.

166
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,179
Whoa.

167
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,580
You need a hand with that?

168
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
I got it.

169
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,438
I, uh, made up your room...

170
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:38,107
... about as young as I could.

171
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:41,267
Didn't have much time to shop, so...

172
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,717
... Your mother said that you like music.

173
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,436
Yeah.

174
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,900
All right, I'll let you get settled.

175
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,864
You've reached Kerry.
- Leave a message.

176
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,964
Hey, it's me.

177
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,202
It's shit here. Call me.

178
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,433
Wow, that's some equipment,
huh?

179
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,533
Yeah.

180
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,540
Uh, dinner's ready if you're hungry.

181
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,708
I'm not.

182
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,710
All right, I'll just put a plate in the fridge,

183
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,346
and then you can nuke that up
later, all right?

184
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,015
Yeah, cool.

185
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,115
All right.

186
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,075
All right.

187
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,864
You know how to get back?

188
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,299
I wrote the address down
for you, just in case.

189
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,136
You can cut through the cemetery
for a short-cut,

190
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,038
go over the bridge, make a left
and then you're home.

191
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:19,608
Oh, you're going to need a key.

192
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,598
I don't get home till, like, 6:00.

193
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,595
Okay.

194
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
Can I help you?

195
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,170
Welcome to our humble abode,
Mr. Harvest.

196
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,339
Take a seat.

197
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:27,142
Everyone, this is Mr. Josh Harvest.

198
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:31,577
He's new in our school.
Let's make him feel at home.

199
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,716
That's DJ Sparks from New York.

200
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,385
That's him.

201
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,787
That dude's last video got,
like, 20 million views.

202
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,023
All right, everybody, turn to
Chapter 12 in your textbooks,

203
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:43,928
which covers the Salvadorian War.

204
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,019
It took place between 1980 and 1992.

205
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,071
Hey, what's up?

206
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,539
I'm Tony.

207
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,142
I noticed you have a class
with my sister.

208
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,077
That's her over there,

209
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,047
and that guy who won't
leave her alone is Michael.

210
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:06,915
She broke up with him last week.

211
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,015
What's your name?

212
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,423
Josh.

213
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,657
Nice to meet you, Josh.

214
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:18,137
What you listening to,
there?

215
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,170
I like it.

216
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,771
It's like electronica,
right?

217
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,107
My sister listens to the same--...

218
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,409
...     My sister listens to
the same type of music...

219
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,545
...    when she's in her room by herself.

220
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,180
It's pretty good.
Who is it?

221
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
I'm not sure.

222
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:41,516
Oh. Well, when you find out,
let me know.

223
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:43,285
I'd like to download it.

224
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,687
Hey, you like dancing?

225
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,022
My sister's
the dance team captain.

226
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,423
You should come
check them out sometime.

227
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:50,988
They're not very good,
though.

228
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,862
You gonna be around here
tomorrow, Josh?

229
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,265
No choice.

230
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,365
Cool, see you tomorrow.

231
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,764
Shit.

232
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,957
Joshua N. Harvest.

233
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:31,693
How's it going?

234
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,628
Alexander Weller,
you can call me Alex.

235
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:35,297
You can call me Al.

236
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:39,301
So, welcome to your
court-ordered counselling.

237
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,836
This should be fun.

238
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:43,004
All right, so let's see here.

239
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,641
You are... a DJ.

240
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:49,971
Like, electronica and stuff like that?

241
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,146
That's cool.

242
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,548
I heard that DJs
are the new rock stars.

243
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,250
I read that somewhere.

244
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,652
I prefer Whitesnake myself.

245
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:59,087
New York.

246
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,556
I was born in New York.
Queens, to be exact.

247
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:06,671
We left when I was 5, so I don't
really remember much of it.

248
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,834
What would you like to talk about?

249
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:15,837
Nothing.

250
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:19,174
You got me for an hour.

251
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:21,909
We got to talk about something.

252
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,351
You like soccer?

253
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,303
Football?

254
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,403
Do you like pizza?

255
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,360
He's going for it,
and he gets fouled.

256
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,529
No, no, that's a flop.

257
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,431
That's a flop.

258
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:43,765
That's not a foul, ref.

259
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:46,635
That's a flop.

260
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,735
That is a flop.

261
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,892
Shit, man, no, no, no.

262
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:04,386
You know what?
That's-- that's time, anyway.

263
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:08,672
Hey, do you mind signing
that book before you go?

264
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,296
Same time tomorrow, or...?

265
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:15,997
Uh, yeah, sorry, kid.

266
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,633
Court order, otherwise I'd just
tell you to stay home.

267
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:21,102
Personally, I don't think
there's anything wrong with you,

268
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:22,671
but hey, there's another game tomorrow.

269
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,936
So, works out pretty well
for both of us, I think.

270
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,082
Hi, you've reached Kerry.
- Leave a message.

271
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:36,518
Or, you know, send me a text
like a normal person.

272
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,618
Bye.

273
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,538
Hey, buddy.

274
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,441
Come on in, have a seat.

275
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:02,611
Pizza?

276
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,762
You hungry?

277
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,118
This game is gonna suck.
Messi's out.

278
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:13,221
Hamstring.

279
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:17,058
Is this all we're gonna do?

280
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,160
Watch games?

281
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,862
Yeah.

282
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,564
I'm not gonna get in trouble or anything?

283
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,132
Get it back to him.

284
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:26,535
Ahhh.

285
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:28,036
No.

286
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:30,238
No, he wasn't outside.

287
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,741
Oh.

288
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,881
All right, maybe he was.

289
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,314
Why do you like soccer so much?

290
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:42,884
You're not even, like,
Latin or anything.

291
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:45,153
Why do you gotta be Latin
to watch soccer?

292
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,588
It's the most popular game in the world,

293
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,558
biggest in Europe of all places.

294
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,826
And I am half-Latin,
actually.

295
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,828
American father,
Argentinean mother.

296
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:57,265
How'd you end up at
this dead-end place, then?

297
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:01,002
Commit a crime and this
is your punishment?

298
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:03,738
Yeah.

299
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:05,206
Yeah, something like that.

300
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:09,059
You gonna let me watch the game?

301
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:16,051
Dinner's ready,
you want some?

302
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:19,421
I'm all right.

303
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:23,858
Some kid from school
dropped this off for you.

304
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,810
Want me to give you a ride?

305
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,929
Hey, Josh.

306
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:37,265
What are you wearing?

307
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:38,933
A tuxedo.

308
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,168
You gonna dance?

309
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,771
I don't dance.

310
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,706
But you like music.

311
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,107
Doesn't mean I dance.

312
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,475
My sister's over there.

313
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:49,110
They're about to do a dance.

314
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,880
They always do a dance for
the whole school to see.

315
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,515
They're not very good, though.

316
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:54,849
Yeah, you said that.

317
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,718
You want to meet her?

318
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,319
I think you'll like her.

319
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:01,672
No, I'm good, thanks.

320
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,937
Is this for real?

321
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,537
Buddy, you mind if I step in real quick?

322
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:52,122
Uh, yeah, go for it.

323
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,067
Hey.

324
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:15,590
That music I've been listening
to, it's you, isn't it?

325
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,455
Hey, man, great music Friday night.

326
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,605
Josh, right?

327
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,607
Hey, so my friends and I
are wondering...

328
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,275
...       where we can get
some of your music?

329
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,375
It was pretty tight.

330
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,382
Nice stunt you pulled Friday night.

331
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,552
I'm only going to say this once,
leave the dance team alone.

332
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,155
You hear me?

333
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,057
Oh, you mean Mary.

334
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,408
Yo, teacher coming.

335
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,131
I swear, I dropped it
around here somewhere.

336
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:58,900
You got to help me find it, Josh.

337
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,369
It's my lucky coin.
Please.

338
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,469
Thanks.

339
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:06,356
I got your back.

340
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:16,261
We did not fight the enemy;
- we fought ourselves.

341
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,890
The war is over for me now,

342
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,059
but it will always be there
for the rest of my days.

343
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:26,694
Joshy boy.

344
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:29,330
Yo, what's going on, man?
How's Kansas?

345
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,598
I'm not in Kansas, man.

346
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,766
What?

347
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,668
Never mind.

348
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:34,936
How you guys doing?

349
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,004
Good, buddy, you know.

350
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:37,238
Just at the club.

351
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:38,907
Yeah, sounds like it.

352
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:42,577
Hey, how's Kerry?
I haven't heard from her.

353
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,846
I've seen her around,

354
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,714
but we don't really talk much
since you left.

355
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:48,016
Look, I got to go, man.

356
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,284
I'll call you tomorrow,
all right?

357
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,274
Don't have too much fun out there.

358
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,233
Good morning, everybody.

359
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,601
Please make your way to your seats.

360
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:07,802
Give me your attention.

361
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,304
We want to hit the ground running.

362
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,872
We've got a lot of ground to cover today.

363
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:12,707
We're going to start where we left off.

364
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:16,411
Excuse me, Mr. West?

365
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:19,080
Josh, principal's office.

366
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,949
Oh.

367
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:23,217
Quiet.

368
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:25,153
The rest of you, then,
your attention this way, please.

369
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,621
I'm going to ask you
a bunch of questions,

370
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:30,036
see who was paying attention last time.

371
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,845
Have a seat, Josh.

372
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,233
Says here you wanted to see me?

373
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,735
I did.

374
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:42,835
Give me a second.

375
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,760
Gulf War, the picture you're looking at.

376
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:54,749
It was a pretty rough war.

377
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:57,251
Yeah, I can imagine.

378
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:59,520
No, you can't.

379
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,406
Okay, I'm all done here.

380
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,427
Josh, this school prides itself
on a couple things,

381
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:07,996
including a pretty solid football team.

382
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:09,831
Been that way for years.

383
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,000
The one thing it doesn't pride
itself on is its dance team.

384
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,203
It places last nearly every year.

385
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,771
It's come to my attention...

386
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:18,940
...they just had their first
victory in seven years.

387
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,944
They used a song you were kind
enough to mix for them.

388
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,612
Ah.

389
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:26,948
No, thanks.

390
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:28,449
You haven't heard my proposal yet.

391
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:30,184
Look, I'm not interested,

392
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,620
and you can't make me, right?

393
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,790
So, can I go now?

394
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,742
You may.

395
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,324
Oh, come on.

396
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:11,526
Get it, get it to Nabor.

397
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,494
Come on, oh.
Goddamn it.

398
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,263
How come you like soccer so much?

399
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,363
I don't know.
I just do.

400
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,867
It was all I knew growing up.

401
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,967
That, and war.

402
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,506
What do you mean 'war'?

403
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,901
My dad, he was in the army.

404
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,678
Is that why you joined?

405
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:32,013
Yeah.

406
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:34,382
Military father, huh?

407
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,551
What was that like?

408
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,121
Your dad, he-- he a good guy?

409
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:44,692
He was a... disciplined guy.

410
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:48,196
What about you?
Was your dad around?

411
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:49,630
Did you read my file?

412
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,730
Yeah, kind of.

413
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,768
So, you're living with him now, right?

414
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:56,471
Yeah, and no.

415
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,571
No, he wasn't around.

416
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:02,110
He left before I was born.

417
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,213
Oh, that's gotta suck.

418
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:08,950
You gotta totally be loving
living with him then, huh?

419
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,718
Hey, you smoke, right?

420
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:15,123
What do you mean,
like, cigarettes?

421
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,959
No, no, like...

422
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,562
...       Yeah, I do.

423
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:22,997
Why, you want some?

424
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,833
No, no, I'm uh...

425
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,502
...  I am done with that.

426
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,238
I used to smoke a lot when I was in Iraq.

427
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:33,141
I used to smoke just to calm
my nerves down, you know?

428
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:35,910
You see a lot of crazy shit over there.

429
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,247
Sleepless nights,
nightmares, stuff like that.

430
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:42,750
They call it post-traumatic
stress disorder in my field.

431
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,919
So, what's that got to do
with me smoking?

432
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:46,921
Just wondered what it is
you're trying to pacify,

433
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:48,856
you know, inside, that's all.

434
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:53,461
You don't have to live the war
to live at war,

435
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:55,561
you know what I mean?

436
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,392
Uh, just a second.

437
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,488
What's up?

438
00:37:54,588 --> 00:37:57,491
You don't have to stop smoking
on my behalf.

439
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:00,328
Just don't burn the house down,
okay?

440
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:03,063
Some friends of yours are here.

441
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:07,435
No, thanks.

442
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,571
No, please, just hear us out.

443
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,939
You heard we won last week?

444
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,108
First time in, like,
seven years.

445
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,611
Yeah, and Josh, we know it's
'cause of that song you mixed.

446
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,878
Honestly, we were just--...

447
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:18,946
...     Like, transformed.

448
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,448
I can't.

449
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,883
Come on, just mix some songs for us.

450
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:24,518
We'll keep you out of the spotlight...

451
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:25,886
...if that's what you're afraid of.

452
00:38:25,986 --> 00:38:27,622
I'm not afraid of anything.

453
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,590
Then, come on. It'll just be,
like, one night a week.

454
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,360
That's all, till we find the
right moves to the right beat.

455
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,460
Yeah.

456
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,932
Okay.

457
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:39,900
Great.

458
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,165
Um, can you see if you can do
something with this?

459
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,991
Hey, can you put Mama's pills
by the sofa, please?

460
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,559
I already did.

461
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:07,395
Okay, can you please
take the trash out?

462
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,297
But it's your week.

463
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:12,233
I know, but can you just
please help me out today?

464
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,467
Fine, whatever.

465
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:14,935
Thank you.

466
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:16,737
Do you have everything
you need for school?

467
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,172
Yeah.

468
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,272
Okay, cool.

469
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:25,542
Mama, did you send out
the electric bill yesterday?

470
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,152
Mama, did you, uh, send out
the electric bill?

471
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:32,586
You know what?

472
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:33,921
I was gonna get to that
this morning, actually.

473
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:35,423
I was gonna take a long walk first,

474
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:36,791
'cause I heard it was gonna rain later...

475
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:38,192
...and I wanted to get an early start.

476
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,760
Sounds good.

477
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,095
Uh, let's get you downstairs.

478
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:42,797
We're gonna be late for school.

479
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,498
Oh, no, no, no.

480
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:46,200
I wanted to make you a big breakfast.

481
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,935
Maybe pancakes.

482
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,037
Should we try to make
some pancakes real quick?

483
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,873
Yeah, I already took care of it,
though, Mama. It's okay, really.

484
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,443
But I-- I want to make you something.

485
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:59,714
Maybe we can have a little quick
treat before you head out.

486
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,282
Hey, buddy.

487
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:02,550
I'm just gonna try to make you a quick--...

488
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,551
...    Mama, it's almost 8:00.

489
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,102
Shoot, um...

490
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,023
...      Okay.

491
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:10,291
I've gotta take my pill.

492
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,126
Here.

493
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:13,728
Oh, can you, um...

494
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,895
...        Yeah, I got it.

495
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,330
get me some water?

496
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,532
Wait, I take one now,
and one at, uh...

497
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:19,533
... Four.

498
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,202
Four, okay.

499
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:23,904
Argh. Can you open this for me, honey?

500
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,574
I'm just gonna try to make this,
um, for you guys.

501
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,209
This was Robert's favourite.

502
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:31,412
Your brother loved a bowl of
cereal with dried fruit.

503
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,214
He was obsessed with dried fruit,

504
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:35,149
and he'd cut it up in little pieces...

505
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:36,884
...and then put it in his cereal,
but he had to have 24 pieces.

506
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:38,586
He would count the pieces.
Thank you.

507
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,422
Oh, can you grab me some milk,
too?

508
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,423
Honey, thank you.

509
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,424
Yup.

510
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,825
And then-- oh, you know what?

511
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,260
I could actually put a little bit in a bag,

512
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,428
but I only have these bowls.

513
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,330
See this?

514
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,331
We're just gonna put some food
in the microwave for you.

515
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:51,332
Just press two minutes.

516
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,100
Okay.

517
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,102
Um, he would have this little
bowl that we got at Disney.

518
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,271
Do you remember that bowl?
Do you remember that?

519
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,839
You guys actually had matching bowls,

520
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:00,574
but you didn't care,
and he was obsessed.

521
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:02,443
He could only eat in that,

522
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,845
and sometimes I would even bring
it up to him at night in bed.

523
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:06,414
At 10 o'clock at night,

524
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:08,449
he was 15 years old
and still wanted to eat cereal.

525
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,549
Okay, that's enough.

526
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,924
I-- I just meant--...

527
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:18,859
...   Come on, Tony, let's go.

528
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:21,462
Just trying to give you
a little-- a little snack.

529
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,533
I'm sorry, I didn't wake up in time to...

530
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,201
...    to do more.

531
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:28,869
What the hell, Angie?

532
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,871
You guys are supposed to check
with me on everything.

533
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:32,473
Especially something like this.

534
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,941
We knew you wouldn't agree.

535
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,376
Come on, it's not totally her fault.

536
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:38,379
No, you guys,
we're fine without him.

537
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:41,615
Okay, if it's new music we need,
I can get us new music.

538
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:42,817
It's not just new music.

539
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,618
Then, what is it, Angie?

540
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:46,387
Do you like him, is that it?

541
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:48,222
Shut up,
he's not even my type.

542
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:49,390
No, it's not about that.

543
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,558
Do you?

544
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:51,559
Guys, shut up.

545
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:52,793
What did you hear?

546
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:55,211
Enough.

547
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,618
Don't--...

548
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,955
...         Hey, wait.

549
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,444
Yeah, look, I get it.

550
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,680
She's not a bad person;
she's just a control freak.

551
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,916
Please, just give it a chance.

552
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:19,086
Whether she knows it or not,
she needs you.

553
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:20,754
We need you.

554
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:25,759
This school, this town,
is good for nothing...

555
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:28,662
...      but for turning out future soldiers.

556
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:30,498
We know it.

557
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:33,601
Most just accept it and life goes on.

558
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:37,671
And we may very well be
the joke of the school,

559
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:41,709
but we just want a shot
at something different.

560
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,061
We're just tired of losing.

561
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,189
Yeah, I'll do it.

562
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:58,225
Oh.

563
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,561
Sorry.

564
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,863
Let me introduce you
to the rest of the gang.

565
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:05,615
Okay.

566
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:24,919
What is it?

567
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,153
He doesn't like it.

568
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:27,922
Tell us.

569
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,224
Look, it's not like I don't like it.

570
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:32,493
It's just that...

571
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:34,995
...  I've seen this before.

572
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:37,398
It's like you guys are
trying to fit the moves...

573
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:39,567
...  into the expectations or something,

574
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,835
instead of just feeling the--
you know what?

575
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:44,738
Here, let's try something.

576
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,941
Try what, exactly?

577
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,410
Just dance.

578
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,845
Feel it.

579
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:54,448
Nobody's watching.

580
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,734
Just have fun.

581
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,008
You're gonna be sore tomorrow.

582
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,409
I'm used to this.

583
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,345
I meant here.

584
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,414
First smile I've seen in a while.

585
00:45:00,514 --> 00:45:02,514
It was nice.

586
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,760
Thank you.
You're awesome.

587
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,759
Hey, Josh,
can you listen to this?

588
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:13,460
Maybe we can do something with it.

589
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,762
Yeah, man.

590
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:15,996
Cool, hey,
thanks for today.

591
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:18,096
That was great.

592
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,338
Hey, you want to go to a movie?

593
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,438
No, thanks.

594
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:48,245
You know, I liked it better
when you were smiling.

595
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,130
Come on, you can go back
to being angry afterward...

596
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,270
...         if you want.

597
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,419
Give it up for the Mustangs.

598
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:24,313
Now, are you ready?

599
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,318
Are you ready.

600
00:46:30,722 --> 00:46:34,390
Give it up for your Patriots.

601
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,380
Bye, honey,
I'll see you later.

602
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,049
Bye.

603
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,149
Hey, Josh,
come on in.

604
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:27,487
Uh, Jenny, two pepperonis and a
six-pack of Diet Pepsi, please.

605
00:48:27,587 --> 00:48:28,555
Right away.

606
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,057
You rock, Jenny.
Mm-hmm.

607
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,859
How you doing today,
champ?

608
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:33,827
You ready for a big match?

609
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:36,392
We got Barce versus Espagnol.

610
00:48:36,463 --> 00:48:41,223
Today, we're going to find out
who the real Catalans are.

611
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:48,709
Man, you mind if I leave
a couple minutes early today?

612
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:50,043
Why?

613
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:53,881
I, uh, got a date.

614
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:55,983
Wow, you work fast.

615
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:59,823
I guess it's true,
DJs do get all the chicks.

616
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:02,756
I don't know about that,
she doesn't even like me.

617
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,925
Hey, girls don't go out
with guys they don't like.

618
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,428
You don't seem very excited about it.

619
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,830
It's just--.

620
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,366
I'm seeing this girl back home,

621
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,268
but she doesn't even answer
her phone anymore.

622
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,104
Oh, it's like that.

623
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,204
Yeah.

624
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,676
You know what,
change is tough, kid.

625
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:27,114
It's-- it's tough,
but it's necessary, you know?

626
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,216
Not this.

627
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:30,884
What do you mean,
'Not this'?

628
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:34,221
Not thi-- me being here
is completely unnecessary.

629
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:38,908
What if your being here
is necessary for others?

630
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,396
You learn that at shrink
community college?

631
00:49:42,496 --> 00:49:43,964
What does that even mean?

632
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,732
I'm not here for anybody else,
man.

633
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:47,601
Yeah, well, maybe
that's your problem.

634
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:50,270
Maybe you should be here
for other people.

635
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,539
Look, nobody's ever been there for me.

636
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,869
Why would I be there for anybody else?

637
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,414
That's a good point.

638
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:03,250
You know what? You're right.

639
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,752
You're right,
fuck everybody else.

640
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:07,955
Wait a second, is it true
that you flipped the music...

641
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:10,057
...      for the dance team
the other night?

642
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:12,157
You know about that?

643
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:13,560
Yeah, of course.

644
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,550
It's a small town,
everybody knows.

645
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,667
Yeah, yeah, I did.

646
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,102
Why did you do that?

647
00:50:22,202 --> 00:50:23,737
The music they were playing hurt my ears.

648
00:50:23,837 --> 00:50:26,173
You could have just left.

649
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,274
Are you gonna let this go?

650
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:29,176
Mm, probably not,

651
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,278
unless you leave,
but you--...

652
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:32,746
...      No, you can't leave until 5:00.

653
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:34,648
So, I can't leave early?

654
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:35,816
No, no, no.

655
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:37,751
This is a court order,
my friend,

656
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,419
and I run a very professional
operation here.

657
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,456
So, tell me, why did you decide
to flip the music?

658
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:45,141
Why didn't you just leave?

659
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:51,331
This kid, Tony.

660
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:53,500
He's all right.

661
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,503
You know, his sister's
the dance team captain,

662
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:58,972
and everyone at the dance
was making fun of them.

663
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:01,308
Just sad, man.

664
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:04,044
Well, that had to feel pretty good.

665
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,814
What? To flip it on them?

666
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:10,317
Yeah.

667
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:11,551
Yeah, yeah, it felt good.

668
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,686
Why?

669
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:14,321
Because, screw those people.

670
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:15,722
They sit on the sidelines,
and they're judging others...

671
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,190
'cause they don't have the balls...

672
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,525
... to get up there and do it themselves,

673
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,993
and then, this poor kid has to sit there...

674
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:21,161
...and listen to his sister get made fun of...

675
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,696
...in front of everybody else.

676
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:24,965
It's just not-- it's sad, it's not cool.

677
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:28,869
I bet that made Tony feel pretty good.

678
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,969
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

679
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,540
I'm just wondering why
would you do that for him...

680
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,380
...  if nobody's ever done anything for you?

681
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,618
Shut up and watch the game, man.

682
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,708
I can hear him coming up the stairs.

683
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,168
I'm really sorry about that.

684
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:05,005
I'll just wear shoulder pads next time.

685
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:07,574
The trailer looked good.

686
00:52:07,674 --> 00:52:10,277
Yeah, I bet.

687
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,329
You can pick the next one.

688
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,070
Do you still trust me?

689
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:25,358
Uh, yeah.

690
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:28,428
Do you want to see
something interesting?

691
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:31,298
Yeah.

692
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,398
Follow me.

693
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,420
What is it?

694
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,656
It's a tree.

695
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:00,427
Very funny.

696
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:02,545
Just a sec.

697
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,623
Are those medals?

698
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:31,723
Yeah.

699
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,544
Are you gonna help me?

700
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,135
What kind are they?

701
00:54:15,235 --> 00:54:16,670
All kinds.

702
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,288
That one is the Bronze Star.

703
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,750
That one is an Air Medal,

704
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:28,797
and that over there
is a Medal of Honour.

705
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,098
You okay?

706
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,269
Yeah.

707
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,592
Tony told me about your brother.

708
00:55:12,692 --> 00:55:15,862
I'm sorry.

709
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:19,232
His name was Robert.

710
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:22,402
Don't be sorry.

711
00:55:22,502 --> 00:55:24,502
It's not your fault.

712
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,442
Who do those belong to?

713
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:34,114
Everyone in town
has lost someone...

714
00:55:34,214 --> 00:55:38,318
...    to some war somewhere.

715
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,086
It's towns like ours...

716
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:41,721
...   that the government gets
most of their soldiers.

717
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:43,990
How come there's nobody ever
at the cemetery?

718
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,559
I walk by it every day.

719
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:49,229
People here like to pretend...

720
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:52,232
...       their loved ones are still alive.

721
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:56,102
Talking about it brings them pain.

722
00:55:56,202 --> 00:55:59,121
It's their way of coping,
I guess.

723
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,285
But you're not like that.

724
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,532
You don't know me.

725
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,239
Let's go.

726
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,339
Thanks for the movie,
and walking me home.

727
00:56:32,439 --> 00:56:35,391
Uh, well, good night.

728
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,501
Hey, how's she doing?

729
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:03,136
Aunt Judith called,

730
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:04,838
wanted to talk to Mom about Robert.

731
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:07,006
Mom started yelling at her,

732
00:57:07,106 --> 00:57:10,009
and told her to stop talking
about him in the past tense.

733
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:12,412
Did you give her her pills?

734
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,415
Yeah, you seen the dosage
on those things?

735
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,218
Those pills can knock out a horse.

736
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:20,587
For days.

737
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,687
Yeah, I know.

738
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,827
Hey, Mom.

739
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:29,062
Mama, come on.

740
00:57:29,162 --> 00:57:32,532
Let's get you to bed, okay?

741
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:34,632
Come on.

742
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,718
Come on, let's go.

743
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:50,283
Let's get you to bed,
come on.

744
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,383
Okay.

745
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,224
There, there. I'm here, Mom.

746
00:57:58,324 --> 00:58:00,760
It's okay.

747
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,860
I miss my boy.

748
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,782
I miss my boy.

749
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,353
I miss my boy.

750
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,410
Still see him...

751
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,547
...  I'm here, it's okay.

752
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:22,647
Don't go.

753
00:58:22,682 --> 00:58:25,084
Don't go...

754
00:58:25,184 --> 00:58:27,649
... I'm here, Mom, it's okay.

755
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,896
We'd give anything to have you back.

756
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,994
I just don't know what
to do anymore, Robert.

757
00:59:08,094 --> 00:59:09,996
I feel like I'm by myself.

758
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:11,931
Hi, Tony.

759
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:13,366
Ahhh.
Hey. What the hell, man?

760
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,168
Josh.

761
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:16,936
We're in a freaking cemetery
in the middle of the night.

762
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:19,305
You scared me to death.

763
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:21,541
I scared you, huh?

764
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,942
What are you doing here,
anyway?

765
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:25,812
I'm walking ho--.

766
00:59:25,912 --> 00:59:29,315
What are you doing here?

767
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:31,951
I came to see Robert.

768
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:34,320
Your brother.

769
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,420
Yeah.

770
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:38,157
Are you all right?

771
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:41,728
Yeah.

772
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,730
My mom was having
one of her fits.

773
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,633
She was going on and on
about Robert.

774
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:49,369
I can't stand to see her like that,

775
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:53,006
so I come here instead.

776
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:55,408
You're not scared?

777
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,244
No. Why, are you?

778
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,580
Of course not.

779
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,015
Come on,
I'll get you home.

780
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:05,430
Hey, can I listen
to some of your music?

781
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:07,451
Yeah, sure.

782
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,395
Hey, man.

783
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:16,396
Hey.

784
01:00:16,496 --> 01:00:18,364
Have a seat.

785
01:00:18,464 --> 01:00:21,935
Do you mind if we don't
watch the game today?

786
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,204
I've got a tune I've been
working on for the dance team,

787
01:00:25,304 --> 01:00:26,739
and I feel like it's just gonna be in my head.

788
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:31,093
Uh, yeah, yeah,
of course.

789
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,385
Oh, and no pizza,
either.

790
01:00:39,485 --> 01:00:42,789
I'm trying to get back into shape.

791
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,223
Sure.

792
01:00:44,323 --> 01:00:46,893
Hey, Jenny, can you put that
in the mail for me?

793
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:48,428
And no pizza today.

794
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:51,598
What do you know
about the people here?

795
01:00:51,698 --> 01:00:55,468
What do you mean?

796
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,371
I know everyone's lost
someone to war,

797
01:00:58,471 --> 01:00:59,806
but no one ever wants
to talk about it.

798
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,608
You know that girl
I was telling you about?

799
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,076
Her name's Mary.

800
01:01:03,176 --> 01:01:04,310
She's the girl I went on a date with.

801
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,311
Congratulations.

802
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,747
She took me to this place.

803
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:09,649
It's a tree with a bunch
of hanging medals...

804
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,084
...     from fallen soldiers.

805
01:01:11,184 --> 01:01:12,552
You know the place
I'm talking about?

806
01:01:12,652 --> 01:01:14,652
I do.

807
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:17,924
I tried talking to her,
and then she just closed off.

808
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:19,892
She wouldn't open up
about anything,

809
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:21,995
and I'm trying to wrap
my head around that.

810
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,796
It doesn't make any sense to me.

811
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:25,798
I mean, you were in the war.
What can you tell me about that?

812
01:01:25,898 --> 01:01:28,801
You know what? She'll, uh,
she'll talk when she's ready.

813
01:01:28,901 --> 01:01:31,504
That's it?
That's the best you've got?

814
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,939
Yeah.

815
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,607
I thought you were supposed
to know the answers...

816
01:01:34,707 --> 01:01:35,742
...to problems and stuff.

817
01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:37,110
Why is that a problem?

818
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,945
Because I want to get to know this girl,

819
01:01:39,045 --> 01:01:41,080
but she won't open up about
anything-- anything personal.

820
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,117
Getting to know somebody
takes patience.

821
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:45,952
It takes time,

822
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:48,588
it takes the other person
wanting to talk about it,

823
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:52,003
and that's what a true relationship is.

824
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,595
Do you have any friends here?

825
01:01:55,695 --> 01:01:58,431
I did.

826
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:01,450
But not anymore.

827
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,675
Is that one of them?

828
01:02:08,775 --> 01:02:10,610
Yeah.

829
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:11,978
Lose him in the war?

830
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:13,112
I did.

831
01:02:13,212 --> 01:02:15,212
You miss him?

832
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:18,233
Every day.

833
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,689
What's that?

834
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:24,999
Why don't you take a look?

835
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,998
This is a-- a Medal of Honour.

836
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:33,132
You have a Medal of Honour?

837
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:34,801
It's not mine.

838
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:35,868
Then, whose is it?

839
01:02:35,968 --> 01:02:37,503
It belongs to a friend of mine.

840
01:02:37,603 --> 01:02:38,871
Then, how come you have it?

841
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:41,574
Because his family doesn't want it.

842
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:45,178
Why not?

843
01:02:45,278 --> 01:02:47,680
You know, why don't you put
the box back on the table,

844
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:52,652
and we'll talk about you
for a minute. Please?

845
01:02:52,752 --> 01:02:54,554
Why don't you tell me
about the music?

846
01:02:54,654 --> 01:02:56,864
Where's the music come in?

847
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,194
I was five.

848
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:05,865
I remember I used to blare
the music so I could drown out...

849
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:10,369
... all my-- all my thoughts.
Everything else.

850
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:15,174
And what about the drugs?

851
01:03:15,274 --> 01:03:19,378
Around... 12?

852
01:03:19,478 --> 01:03:22,515
How do they make you feel?

853
01:03:22,615 --> 01:03:24,450
Sometimes the music
just isn't enough, you know?

854
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,853
Mm, yeah, I know.

855
01:03:26,953 --> 01:03:30,183
Why doesn't the family want the medal?

856
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,229
I'll tell you about that
next time we meet,

857
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:39,481
how's that sound?

858
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:45,138
One, two, three, four.

859
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,278
Five, six, seven, eight.

860
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,634
Oh.

861
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,839
Angie, you okay?

862
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:05,491
Are you okay?

863
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,726
I don't know, it just-- it just hurts.

864
01:04:06,826 --> 01:04:07,927
Tony, go get ice.

865
01:04:08,027 --> 01:04:08,928
Wait, wait, no.
Mary, Mary.

866
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:12,431
Breathe.

867
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:13,933
Top of section one and two,
ready?

868
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:15,101
Where did you learn this?

869
01:04:15,201 --> 01:04:16,402
YouTube.

870
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:18,437
One and two, and three and four.

871
01:04:18,537 --> 01:04:20,072
And five and six, seven, eight.

872
01:04:20,172 --> 01:04:22,642
One, straight legs.
Three and four.

873
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:26,112
Can I have your attention,
please?

874
01:04:26,212 --> 01:04:28,147
I wanted to be the first to tell you...

875
01:04:28,247 --> 01:04:29,949
...that people at the state level...

876
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,952
...   have caught wind
of what's going on here,

877
01:04:33,052 --> 01:04:34,821
and our school has been invited
to the state invitational...

878
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:36,789
...   for the first time in seven years.

879
01:04:36,889 --> 01:04:38,191
What?.

880
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,093
With only one condition:

881
01:04:41,193 --> 01:04:43,095
that you win the remaining competitions.

882
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:44,263
Done.

883
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:45,832
Listen, there's one more thing.

884
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:49,386
Our school could be hosting
the invitational.

885
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,486
Oh, yes.

886
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,342
Hey, you need to be
resting that ankle.

887
01:04:56,442 --> 01:04:58,442
Congrats.

888
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,881
All right, all right,
back to rehearsals.

889
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,683
You guys are facing the Hornets this week,

890
01:05:03,783 --> 01:05:08,543
and they're a bunch of stingers,
I'll tell you that much.

891
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,775
Hey.

892
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,578
There's a plate of food for you over here.

893
01:06:39,678 --> 01:06:44,778
If you just want to throw it in
the microwave and warm it up.

894
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,637
How's school going?

895
01:06:50,689 --> 01:06:52,689
Okay.

896
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,261
How about those meetings
with your advisor?

897
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:57,430
The shrink?

898
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,899
Yeah.

899
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,999
Okay.

900
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,106
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

901
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:09,008
I saw this pair of jeans on sale,

902
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:13,779
and uh, the lady at the store
said it was a pretty cool brand.

903
01:07:13,879 --> 01:07:17,799
I don't know,
they probably fit.

904
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,590
Thanks.

905
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,690
Yeah, you're welcome.

906
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,869
Hey, Josh.

907
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:19,805
Oh, hello.

908
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,040
Hi, um, I'm Mary.

909
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,741
Uh, we go to school together.

910
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:24,110
Oh.

911
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,278
I'm Jim,
I'm Josh's dad.

912
01:09:26,378 --> 01:09:28,314
We're just going to be listening
to music in my room.

913
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,050
All right, sounds good.

914
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,418
Nice to meet you.

915
01:09:32,518 --> 01:09:35,068
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

916
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:51,470
Your dad seems really nice.

917
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:56,524
Um, that song you did for Lou
was... really good.

918
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,112
Thanks.

919
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:04,316
I was actually thinking we could
do something for Mia.

920
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:07,620
You know, mix of a little Asian,

921
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,090
and a sprinkle of your magic.

922
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:12,791
Way ahead of you.

923
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:14,126
Really? Can I hear?

924
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:19,098
I'm not finished with it yet,
so...

925
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:21,800
You want to watch a movie or something?

926
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,436
Um, yeah, which one?

927
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:28,507
You ever seen Platoon?

928
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,976
That's a, uh, war movie, right?

929
01:10:31,076 --> 01:10:33,076
Yeah.

930
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,016
Um...

931
01:10:37,116 --> 01:10:41,487
...     I got to get going,
so maybe another time?

932
01:10:41,587 --> 01:10:43,838
Yeah, yeah.

933
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,293
Of course.

934
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:48,827
I'll walk you home.

935
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:50,927
Yeah.

936
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:56,235
So, how's Tony doing?

937
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,335
He's fine.

938
01:10:58,404 --> 01:11:01,340
Why do you ask?

939
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,677
Saw him the other night at the cemetery.

940
01:11:04,777 --> 01:11:07,695
Yeah, he does that.

941
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,485
He told me about your mom.

942
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:15,821
He did?

943
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:18,373
Yeah, it sounds rough.

944
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,531
I swear to God that kid's
gonna end up working...

945
01:11:25,631 --> 01:11:29,868
... for the National Enquirer or something.

946
01:11:29,968 --> 01:11:32,871
Sure seems to love you a lot.

947
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:35,351
Yeah, well, he's my brother.

948
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,395
Do you miss Robert?

949
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:46,018
Since when do you get to ask me
a question like that?

950
01:11:46,118 --> 01:11:47,386
I mean, as far as I know,

951
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:48,854
you haven't told me anything about you.

952
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:50,089
Yeah, there's nothing to tell.

953
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:52,189
Bullshit.

954
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:53,626
I mean, you don't end up
in a place like this...

955
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,760
...for good behaviour, Josh.

956
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:57,529
So, what did you do?

957
01:11:57,629 --> 01:11:59,265
Why don't you speak to your father?

958
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:00,566
Where's your mother?

959
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:02,034
You know what, you're right.

960
01:12:02,134 --> 01:12:03,135
There's no reason to talk about this.

961
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,470
I was trying to be polite.

962
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,120
Not like I give a damn,
anyway.

963
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,359
You're such an asshole.

964
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,322
Hey.

965
01:12:56,422 --> 01:12:59,822
What did I tell you
about the dance team?

966
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,492
Should've listened to me.

967
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:27,335
Maybe you'll listen next time.

968
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:41,166
So, the state semi-finals, huh?

969
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:43,035
Yeah, word travels fast around here.

970
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:45,738
Like I told you,
everybody knows everything...

971
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,740
...about everybody else,
except for you.

972
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,142
You know, I've been asked about you.

973
01:13:50,242 --> 01:13:52,478
People are very curious.

974
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:53,746
And?

975
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,981
And nothing,
I can't say anything.

976
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:57,416
That would be breaking the law,

977
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,817
but more importantly,

978
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:03,021
that would be breaking your trust.

979
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:04,189
So, what next?

980
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:05,491
You tell me.

981
01:14:05,591 --> 01:14:07,631
Want to talk about that?

982
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:10,896
Not really.

983
01:14:10,996 --> 01:14:13,232
You know,
kids can be mean.

984
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:17,603
But I think that it's important
that you understand...

985
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,571
...where all that anger's coming from.

986
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:24,443
Did you know what Michael lost
his parents when he was young?

987
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:25,611
He's afraid, just like you.

988
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,513
I'm not afraid of anything.

989
01:14:27,613 --> 01:14:28,580
Except maybe love.

990
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,882
Listen to you.

991
01:14:29,982 --> 01:14:32,284
You're crazier than your patients.

992
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:35,336
Am I?
How's it going with Mary?

993
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,058
It's not.

994
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:41,527
How come?

995
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:44,196
Because she's nuts, man.

996
01:14:44,296 --> 01:14:48,200
Got all kinds of crazy shit going on.

997
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,436
What kind of shit?

998
01:14:50,536 --> 01:14:52,805
Shit. Crazy little brother,
crazy mother.

999
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,808
Doesn't walk to talk about her
other brother, shit like that.

1000
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,110
Actually, I have one for you.

1001
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:00,312
You have anything to do
with your best friend dying?

1002
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,614
No.

1003
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:04,550
Were you there with him,
for his last breath?

1004
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:08,387
Yeah.

1005
01:15:08,487 --> 01:15:10,088
Why didn't you save him?

1006
01:15:10,188 --> 01:15:11,657
Because I couldn't.

1007
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,125
Did you at least try?

1008
01:15:13,225 --> 01:15:15,260
I couldn't.

1009
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,662
Then, what happened?

1010
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,567
Why'd he get the Medal of Honour?

1011
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:23,836
He--.

1012
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,572
We were on our way back
from the U.S. Embassy,

1013
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:29,341
and there was a bomb threat
that turned out to be real.

1014
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:32,744
I thought it was fake,
but he went, anyway.

1015
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:37,749
And if he'd have listened to me,
that bomb would have gone off.

1016
01:15:37,849 --> 01:15:40,352
He risked his life...

1017
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:44,532
...for a whole bunch of people
he never even met.

1018
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,945
And he was the only one who died that day.

1019
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:53,499
Why doesn't his family
want the medal?

1020
01:15:53,599 --> 01:15:55,834
Because they don't.
It's your turn.

1021
01:15:55,934 --> 01:15:59,471
What happened with your mother
back home?

1022
01:15:59,571 --> 01:16:02,007
What does that have to do
with anything?

1023
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:03,876
Everything, because I
think there's a reason...

1024
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,144
...why you won't get
close to anybody, Josh.

1025
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:10,579
And you think it has something
to do with my mother?

1026
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:22,861
Is it because my mother
didn't want me to be born?

1027
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:24,961
Is that it?

1028
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:28,166
She told you that?

1029
01:16:28,266 --> 01:16:30,266
When?

1030
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,041
Right before I came here.

1031
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:41,046
I always knew I didn't matter
to her, you know?

1032
01:16:41,146 --> 01:16:43,482
I'm sorry.

1033
01:16:43,582 --> 01:16:47,052
It's not your fault.
It's mine.

1034
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:50,489
How do you figure that?

1035
01:16:50,589 --> 01:16:53,825
I used to watch my friends'
parents cook them food,

1036
01:16:53,925 --> 01:16:56,395
brush their hair,
take them to school.

1037
01:16:56,495 --> 01:16:58,230
And I figured, you know,
they were good kids.

1038
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,865
They got that,
they deserved it.

1039
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:01,733
Wh-- and you weren't a good kid?

1040
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,235
You didn't deserve it?

1041
01:17:03,335 --> 01:17:05,404
I got kicked out of schools left and right.

1042
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:07,372
I got into fights everywhere.

1043
01:17:07,472 --> 01:17:11,109
I started using drugs young,
shit like that, man.

1044
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,778
Josh, it isn't your fault.

1045
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,048
Kids born with messed-up
parents, it's never their fault.

1046
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:18,383
You got to understand that, man.

1047
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:21,119
What would know about it?
'Cause you studied it?

1048
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,555
I guess it just seems logical.

1049
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:26,692
So, why don't you have
a wife and kids, and all that?

1050
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:29,027
Because I'm here.

1051
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:32,297
Because I made a promise.

1052
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:35,082
What promise?

1053
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,438
We made a promise that if
anything happened...

1054
01:17:39,538 --> 01:17:42,240
...to either one of us,

1055
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,644
we would take care
of each other's families.

1056
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:48,213
So, the family's here, then?

1057
01:17:48,313 --> 01:17:51,617
Yeah, but they don't want
anything to do with me.

1058
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:55,420
So, your turn.

1059
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,723
Why don't you tell Mary about you?

1060
01:17:57,823 --> 01:17:59,157
Why? What for?

1061
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,593
Listen, just tell her what you're afraid of,

1062
01:18:01,693 --> 01:18:03,295
and maybe she'll tell you
what she's afraid of.

1063
01:18:03,395 --> 01:18:04,496
What am I afraid of?

1064
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:05,831
I'm not afraid of anything.

1065
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,666
Come on, kid.
Be smarter than your pain.

1066
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:11,003
If you stand a chance
at loving anybody out there,

1067
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:14,239
you have got to let them in.

1068
01:18:14,339 --> 01:18:17,275
Look, I did.

1069
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,611
And yeah, I lost my best friend,
but you know what?

1070
01:18:19,711 --> 01:18:22,781
At least I know what it's like
to care about somebody.

1071
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:26,418
Yeah, well, if helping out
a town that's beyond help...

1072
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:30,037
...    is caring about people,
I pass.

1073
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:42,834
Are you okay, Josh?

1074
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:44,302
Yeah.

1075
01:18:44,402 --> 01:18:48,607
Josh, you want to tell me about those?

1076
01:18:48,707 --> 01:18:51,510
My mixing board fell on me.

1077
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:54,212
You okay?

1078
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:59,327
You just make sure and tell me
if that board gets too heavy.

1079
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,687
Give a warm welcome to our guests,

1080
01:19:01,787 --> 01:19:03,787
the Sentinels.

1081
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:55,714
The Sentinels, everybody.

1082
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:01,554
And now, your very own,
the Patriots.

1083
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:09,291
Okay, guys,
just like we practiced.

1084
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:36,701
Here, Mama.

1085
01:22:36,801 --> 01:22:39,170
Oh, I'm just trying to
straighten things up here...

1086
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,270
... for Robert.

1087
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:50,181
Hey.

1088
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:53,018
Who is it, Mary?

1089
01:22:53,118 --> 01:22:55,754
It's no one, Mama.

1090
01:22:55,854 --> 01:22:58,574
Look, it's not a good time,
okay?

1091
01:22:58,623 --> 01:23:00,292
I'm sorry about walking away the other day.

1092
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,594
Really, you should go.

1093
01:23:02,694 --> 01:23:04,262
Hello.
Hi.

1094
01:23:04,362 --> 01:23:06,932
Mama, this is Josh.

1095
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:08,600
He's a friend from school.

1096
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,901
Hi, Josh.

1097
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:12,437
Well, you don't want to be rude.

1098
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:14,072
Would you like to come in?

1099
01:23:14,172 --> 01:23:16,875
Come on in.

1100
01:23:16,975 --> 01:23:19,077
It's a bit of a mess
here, Josh. I haven't--...

1101
01:23:19,177 --> 01:23:21,780
...Really, it's not a good time right now.

1102
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,617
Sorry, it's not how I like to have company.

1103
01:23:25,717 --> 01:23:27,752
Forgive me.

1104
01:23:27,852 --> 01:23:30,422
Oh, don't worry about it.

1105
01:23:30,522 --> 01:23:32,590
Josh, are you hungry?
Did you have dinner?

1106
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:33,825
I actually just did, yeah.

1107
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:34,826
Oh, okay.

1108
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,661
I'll be right back.

1109
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:39,264
Okay, Mary, maybe you want to
offer him something to drink?

1110
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:41,364
I'm okay, I can't--.

1111
01:23:41,366 --> 01:23:42,467
I can't stay around long, anyways.

1112
01:23:42,567 --> 01:23:45,270
Okay, she's--...

1113
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:48,005
...I'm sure just be right back.

1114
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,478
Oh, my God.

1115
01:23:53,578 --> 01:23:55,246
I was just, uh, cleaning up,

1116
01:23:55,346 --> 01:23:58,683
so that's why we're a bit messy
around here.

1117
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,352
We've just been cleaning and
organizing all our pictures,

1118
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:04,823
and I'm going through all these photos.

1119
01:24:04,923 --> 01:24:07,492
I've been putting them
in photo boxes and albums.

1120
01:24:07,592 --> 01:24:11,830
There's, um, this album's
of Mary's brother.

1121
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:14,314
Robert as a baby.

1122
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,040
Look at this boy.

1123
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,708
He's so handsome.

1124
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:25,310
That's when he first went into the army.

1125
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:28,813
This is him probably
just about your age, right?

1126
01:24:28,913 --> 01:24:30,115
Yeah, looks like it.

1127
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:32,817
Such a good boy.

1128
01:24:32,917 --> 01:24:37,489
Always thinking of everybody,
taking care of us,

1129
01:24:37,589 --> 01:24:39,557
sending cheques every month.

1130
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:42,394
I don't spend the money,
I'm saving it.

1131
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,494
Mom.

1132
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,198
I'm sorry, did--.

1133
01:24:47,298 --> 01:24:50,235
Did I not offer you something to drink?

1134
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:51,803
Oh, yeah, no.

1135
01:24:51,903 --> 01:24:54,406
It's-- I'm good, actually.
Thank you.

1136
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:55,540
Okay.

1137
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,042
Look at this one.

1138
01:24:57,142 --> 01:24:59,811
This is the one he misses the most.

1139
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:03,348
Right? Every letter I get,
he's talking about her.

1140
01:25:03,448 --> 01:25:07,519
And then, she doesn't write back, but...

1141
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:10,922
You kids can't know what
it's like for us parents.

1142
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:15,693
We're just waiting and waiting...

1143
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:19,030
Waiting for our little boy to
come through the front door.

1144
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:21,255
Okay, Mom, that's enough.

1145
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,953
It's just been so long.

1146
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,207
Would you mind if I...

1147
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:30,842
... Oh.

1148
01:25:30,942 --> 01:25:32,577
...if I looked through this?

1149
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:35,246
Please, I, uh,
I've got more.

1150
01:25:35,346 --> 01:25:40,251
I, um, I've got a whole box here.

1151
01:25:40,351 --> 01:25:42,387
I've got-- oh,
every boy's favourite.

1152
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:45,256
The braces picture.

1153
01:25:45,356 --> 01:25:48,626
Here he is with his best friend.

1154
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:50,929
Look how handsome those boys are.

1155
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:55,200
Look at the two of them,
so happy.

1156
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:56,901
I know--.

1157
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:59,586
I wish Alex would come visit.

1158
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:05,859
I mean, he has so many stories
about Robert.

1159
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:09,763
He promised me.

1160
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:16,955
He promised he would take care of my boy.

1161
01:26:17,055 --> 01:26:19,424
I can't do this today.

1162
01:26:19,524 --> 01:26:21,524
It's just been so long.

1163
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,736
What, uh--.

1164
01:26:31,836 --> 01:26:34,506
I'm sorry.

1165
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,757
What did she say?

1166
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:44,031
You were, um, you were
showing me, uh...

1167
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,134
Graduation.

1168
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,767
You okay?

1169
01:27:02,867 --> 01:27:04,867
Yeah.

1170
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:10,275
I'm really sorry about that.

1171
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:15,213
I just can't stand it sometimes.

1172
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,313
You okay?

1173
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,433
Yeah.

1174
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:24,522
Why are you so hard on her?

1175
01:27:24,622 --> 01:27:26,124
She just misses her son,
you know?

1176
01:27:26,224 --> 01:27:27,892
You don't know.

1177
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:31,796
Last time I tried to ignore
her depression,

1178
01:27:31,896 --> 01:27:35,633
and stopped giving her her pills,

1179
01:27:35,733 --> 01:27:38,136
she ended up in the ICU.

1180
01:27:38,236 --> 01:27:42,740
She tried to poison herself.

1181
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,078
That's what I have to live with.

1182
01:27:47,178 --> 01:27:51,131
Can we just talk about something else?

1183
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:58,405
You want to go fishing?

1184
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:11,169
Look, I don't know
how long you're staying,

1185
01:28:11,269 --> 01:28:14,187
but I'm really glad you're here.

1186
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,430
I have to go.

1187
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:40,598
Wh--why?

1188
01:28:40,698 --> 01:28:42,698
It's getting late.

1189
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,902
I just have to go.

1190
01:28:45,002 --> 01:28:46,070
Yeah, just wait a minute.

1191
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:47,739
Why are you leaving?

1192
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:49,207
You just don't get it.

1193
01:28:49,307 --> 01:28:51,142
I don't get what?

1194
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:52,777
Nothing,
you don't get anything.

1195
01:28:52,877 --> 01:28:55,446
So, tell me.

1196
01:28:55,546 --> 01:28:56,914
Just let me go, okay?

1197
01:28:57,014 --> 01:28:58,950
No, not until you tell me what's going on.

1198
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:02,553
Why is it always the same thing
with you people here?

1199
01:29:02,653 --> 01:29:04,789
Don't judge us.

1200
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:06,624
You're the last person that
should be judging us.

1201
01:29:06,724 --> 01:29:08,259
No.

1202
01:29:08,359 --> 01:29:09,794
Why won't you just tell me
about your brother?

1203
01:29:09,894 --> 01:29:12,163
Because this is not a movie for me.

1204
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:14,799
This is real.

1205
01:29:14,899 --> 01:29:19,829
I have to live it every single
day, and it's painful, Josh.

1206
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:44,128
What if you just accept it?

1207
01:29:44,228 --> 01:29:47,598
You don't think I have?

1208
01:29:47,698 --> 01:29:49,500
I have, okay?

1209
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,536
Then, why won't you talk to Alex
about your brother's death?

1210
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,505
He was his best friend.

1211
01:29:54,605 --> 01:29:56,107
He was there for his last breath,

1212
01:29:56,207 --> 01:29:57,608
and you won't even accept his medal?

1213
01:29:57,708 --> 01:30:00,044
Did he tell you why?

1214
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:04,482
That man is a thief and a liar.

1215
01:30:04,582 --> 01:30:06,984
He took Robert away from us.

1216
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:08,986
He said that he would
always protect him.

1217
01:30:09,086 --> 01:30:11,289
So, don't you go pointing fingers...

1218
01:30:11,389 --> 01:30:12,990
...  if you don't know the truth
about what's going on here.

1219
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:14,726
You have no clue what it's like...

1220
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,462
...      to lose the people that you love,

1221
01:30:17,562 --> 01:30:19,564
to feel abandoned by them.

1222
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,866
You don't know that.
You know nothing about me.

1223
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:23,968
Tell me.
Tell me something, anything.

1224
01:30:24,068 --> 01:30:26,671
What did you do back home
to end up here, huh?

1225
01:30:26,771 --> 01:30:29,240
And why don't you speak
to your father?

1226
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,309
He's right outside that door.

1227
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:34,645
Mine is gone forever.

1228
01:30:34,745 --> 01:30:36,681
And where's your mother?
Where is she?

1229
01:30:36,781 --> 01:30:39,183
Mine is at home living in the past.

1230
01:30:39,283 --> 01:30:42,887
You know nothing about
being left behind.

1231
01:30:42,987 --> 01:30:44,055
You want to know something?

1232
01:30:44,155 --> 01:30:45,890
You want to know something about me?

1233
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:48,693
My parents abandoned me
before I was even born.

1234
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:51,768
How's that for getting left behind?

1235
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:57,228
What are you doing here?

1236
01:31:57,328 --> 01:32:00,097
We need to talk.

1237
01:32:00,197 --> 01:32:02,832
Are you crazy?
This is my house.

1238
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:04,602
How the hell do you know where I live?

1239
01:32:04,702 --> 01:32:05,937
Remember that trust thing
we talked about?

1240
01:32:06,037 --> 01:32:07,505
Shove it up your ass.

1241
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:08,806
You lied to me.

1242
01:32:08,906 --> 01:32:10,942
Okay, Josh,
how did I lie to you?

1243
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:13,444
You didn't tell me your best
friend was Mary's brother.

1244
01:32:13,544 --> 01:32:15,413
That's none of your
goddamn business.

1245
01:32:15,513 --> 01:32:17,114
That is between me
and that family.

1246
01:32:17,214 --> 01:32:18,683
You knew about me and Mary,

1247
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,418
yet you failed to mention that?

1248
01:32:20,518 --> 01:32:25,089
Well, I guessed you would
find out in your own time.

1249
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:28,960
She told me why they don't talk to you.

1250
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,595
You made a promise you couldn't keep.

1251
01:32:30,695 --> 01:32:32,296
Why would you promise
to protect somebody...

1252
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:34,031
...when you know you can't keep that?.

1253
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:35,933
That family trusted you.
They listened to you.

1254
01:32:36,033 --> 01:32:37,468
And you let them down.

1255
01:32:37,568 --> 01:32:39,203
I need you to leave.

1256
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:40,338
Just why did you do it?
Why?.

1257
01:32:40,438 --> 01:32:41,639
Oh, Jesus.

1258
01:32:41,739 --> 01:32:42,940
Because it was my job.

1259
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,442
It's my fucking job,

1260
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:47,278
and don't you ever fucking
touch me again.

1261
01:32:47,378 --> 01:32:51,464
So, what, it's your job to lie to people?

1262
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:01,459
I was a recruiter in the army.

1263
01:33:01,559 --> 01:33:02,660
I had to make a mission.
I had a quota.

1264
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,962
So, you lied to him?

1265
01:33:05,062 --> 01:33:07,062
I had a quota.

1266
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:12,003
And Robert was a special kid,
man.

1267
01:33:12,103 --> 01:33:15,540
I felt compelled to protect him
from the day he joined up.

1268
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:20,077
I kept him by my side from the
moment we touched down in Iraq.

1269
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:22,179
Yeah, I guess I--...

1270
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:23,814
...  I guess I did lie to them.

1271
01:33:23,914 --> 01:33:25,483
But I can't change that now.

1272
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,151
I have to live with that.

1273
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:30,321
They're right not to want
to speak with me.

1274
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:32,390
But I made another promise,
a promise to Robert.

1275
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:36,494
A promise that I will not break.

1276
01:33:36,594 --> 01:33:38,563
And I will stay in this town
until the day that I die...

1277
01:33:38,663 --> 01:33:41,198
...       to fulfill it.

1278
01:33:41,298 --> 01:33:43,000
You can change that.

1279
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:46,504
I can't change it.

1280
01:33:46,604 --> 01:33:48,372
Those are strong words
to come from somebody...

1281
01:33:48,472 --> 01:33:51,277
...who claims he can help people.

1282
01:33:53,395 --> 01:33:54,845
You gave up on them.

1283
01:33:54,945 --> 01:33:56,581
I didn't give up on them.

1284
01:33:56,681 --> 01:33:58,549
They don't want my help.

1285
01:33:58,649 --> 01:34:01,085
They don't want anything
to do with me.

1286
01:34:01,185 --> 01:34:02,687
Just like that?
You're going to give up?

1287
01:34:02,787 --> 01:34:03,888
You're going to throw in
the towel just like that?

1288
01:34:03,988 --> 01:34:05,756
You don't do that.

1289
01:34:05,856 --> 01:34:07,758
You don't do that, and you're
the one who told me that.

1290
01:34:07,858 --> 01:34:10,361
When you care about someone,
you have to be willing to lose.

1291
01:34:10,461 --> 01:34:11,762
And I did lose.

1292
01:34:11,862 --> 01:34:14,599
I lost their trust when that kid died.

1293
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:16,300
Yeah, he's gone,
but you're still here,

1294
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,736
and that family is right here.

1295
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:20,471
So, don't go telling me
about taking chances...

1296
01:34:20,571 --> 01:34:22,139
...when you're the one
who gave up on them...

1297
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,959
...so easily in the first place.

1298
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,552
What?

1299
01:34:34,652 --> 01:34:37,054
You.

1300
01:34:37,154 --> 01:34:42,008
Actually caring about
other people, it's amazing.

1301
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:52,770
You know, I thought
you and I were alike,

1302
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,006
but we're not.

1303
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,676
I'm not going to give up
on them so easily.

1304
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,658
Morning.

1305
01:35:47,758 --> 01:35:50,995
I hear today's the, uh,
big day.

1306
01:35:51,095 --> 01:35:53,313
Yeah.

1307
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:58,135
I sure would like to come
and see you guys.

1308
01:35:58,235 --> 01:36:00,653
Then, come.

1309
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:42,012
Oh.

1310
01:36:42,112 --> 01:36:44,248
Oh, did I oversleep?

1311
01:36:44,348 --> 01:36:46,550
No, Mama, we're just on our way to school.

1312
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:48,018
I just wanted to let you know...

1313
01:36:48,118 --> 01:36:49,520
...  we're going to be home late tonight.

1314
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:52,389
I got to-- I got to make you breakfast.

1315
01:36:52,489 --> 01:36:56,127
You can't go to school
on an empty stomach.

1316
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:59,530
Today's the state's invitational,

1317
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:02,800
in case you're interested.

1318
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:07,805
Yeah, I'm dedicating it to Robert.

1319
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:11,324
I think he would have liked it.

1320
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:22,235
He was so handsome.

1321
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,841
Hey.

1322
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,797
Mama, you got two kids right here.

1323
01:37:32,897 --> 01:37:36,433
Alive.

1324
01:37:36,533 --> 01:37:40,237
Two kids who love
and miss you so much,

1325
01:37:40,337 --> 01:37:44,958
and that are waiting for you
to be okay again.

1326
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:50,363
We love you.

1327
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:55,902
Come on, Tony.

1328
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:45,703
I, uh...

1329
01:38:45,803 --> 01:38:48,138
...I came here to say I'm sorry.

1330
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:50,674
For what?

1331
01:38:50,774 --> 01:38:55,012
For your loss.

1332
01:38:55,112 --> 01:38:58,582
For your pain.

1333
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:02,586
It's not your fault.

1334
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:07,640
I know, but it's not yours,
either.

1335
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:25,342
Come on.

1336
01:39:25,442 --> 01:39:29,182
Let's give this town
something to talk about.

1337
01:39:30,664 --> 01:39:32,664
Okay.

1338
01:39:36,604 --> 01:39:39,456
Welcome to the North Dakota
2014 Dance Invitational.

1339
01:39:39,556 --> 01:39:42,459
Showtime is less than two hours away.

1340
01:39:42,559 --> 01:39:46,030
All dancers must finish signing
in before rehearsals can begin.

1341
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:50,380
Congratulations to everyone,
and good luck tonight.

1342
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:04,715
Hey, dude.

1343
01:40:04,815 --> 01:40:06,150
Those headphones kind of suck.

1344
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,585
Want to use mine?

1345
01:40:08,685 --> 01:40:10,054
Where did you get these?

1346
01:40:10,154 --> 01:40:11,455
Don't worry about it,
I got connections.

1347
01:40:11,555 --> 01:40:12,489
Thanks, kid.

1348
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:15,392
That's what friends are for.

1349
01:40:15,492 --> 01:40:17,492
Here we go.

1350
01:40:19,214 --> 01:40:23,549
Are you all ready for the 2014
state's invitational?

1351
01:40:27,222 --> 01:40:31,642
Taking the stage, the defending
champions, the Kings.

1352
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:41,260
Give it up for defending
state champions, the Kings.

1353
01:41:44,933 --> 01:41:47,184
And now, the surprise of the season,

1354
01:41:47,284 --> 01:41:50,587
and the moment I know
you've all been waiting for,

1355
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:52,839
your host, the Patriots.

1356
01:42:05,986 --> 01:42:07,604
You sure you're okay?

1357
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:09,704
I'm good to go.

1358
01:42:09,773 --> 01:42:12,625
Let's do this.

1359
01:46:52,172 --> 01:46:55,141
So, this is where you've been.

1360
01:46:57,844 --> 01:47:00,079
I don't want you to leave.

1361
01:47:04,785 --> 01:47:07,787
I'm not leaving without you.

1362
01:47:12,025 --> 01:47:14,211
What?

1363
01:47:14,311 --> 01:47:18,464
Someone here wants
to give you something.

1364
01:47:56,169 --> 01:47:58,169
I'm sorry.

1365
01:47:58,188 --> 01:48:00,539
I know.
