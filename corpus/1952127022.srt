1
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,700
In every speck shines His divine light

2
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,300
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

4
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,200
Because we are all in His form.
That's worship

5
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,900
What would have happened
if the red-headed man...

6
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,200
...hadn't woken up at dawn that day
to relieve himself?

7
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Perhaps life would have carried
on in Delhi-6 as it had for centuries

8
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
And my life might not have been
turned upside down

9
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,400
But then again

10
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,500
When you got to go, you got to go!

11
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
In the Treta Age of the Vedic era

12
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,400
The evil ten-headed Ravan ruled supreme

13
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,200
The Sun, Moon, Wind and Fire
were enslaved to Ravan

14
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,900
Who could save the universe from Ravan?

15
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,300
A divine voice spoke: "I will be born
as Ram in Awadh to save you"

16
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,700
The tumour is close to her area of vision

17
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,500
Fatima, ask the fool how long I've got?

18
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
Ma, don't say that! Allah forbid it

19
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,500
Who do you have in India?

20
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Did these five years with us bore you?

21
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,300
No, child. But you must merge with
the soil on which you are born

22
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
Ma, these are old proverbs

23
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Son, think of it as my last wish

24
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Ma, you're like a stubborn child

25
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
You make life difficult

26
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
You know I'll never go back to Delhi.

27
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,900
I couldn't see well in the dark.
He was 8ft. 2

28
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Covered in black hair

29
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,800
His nails shone like knives

30
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,300
Anyone who dares to sleep is dead!

31
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,900
He'll creep up on you at night

32
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,600
He'll kill you. Murder you. Who is he?

33
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes! The murderer is a monkey

34
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,200
A dark Black Monkey!

35
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
The Black Monkey kills.
The Black Monkey murders

36
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Beware! 24/7. From Delhi, Kumar

37
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,600
The first one to welcome me
to Delhi was the Black Monkey

38
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,900
Maybe destiny was sending me a sign

39
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
Would you care for a paan?

40
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,100
Salaam, Mrs. Mehra

41
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,000
Now I can die in peace

42
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
My love dragged you back, didn't it?

43
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,200
I forgot all about you

44
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Recognise him?

45
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,900
At last! Now my eyes can rest
forever now. Let me hug you

46
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
Come on! Give me a hug

47
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm Ali Baig!

48
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,400
A flood of people!
Delhi is teeming with life

49
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,900
Everything happening at the same time.
Yet there is a kind of balance

50
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,600
You can't enter like this

51
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,900
First sweeten your mouth

52
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
Mamdu! How are you?

53
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
You're back at last!

54
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Salaams, Hina! My sister-in-law

55
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Why the long face?
Aren't you looking after her?

56
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Gobar! Bless you, son

57
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Guess who's here!
My grandson. Roshan

58
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,800
He isn't hungry

59
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,400
Only dogs eat when they're hungry.
Humans eat to bond with each other

60
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,800
Have one

61
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,700
Only the lucky few taste
Mamdu's sweets

62
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Or you can't go through

63
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,500
My beloved has returned home

64
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,600
People have great faith in this place

65
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,200
They say if you hang a bell
with a pure heart

66
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,600
God will heed you

67
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,400
I hung a bell before I left and prayed...

68
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,200
...to return with my whole family

69
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,800
God heard me. At least in part

70
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
Home at last! Your Paswaan Lane

71
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,000
It's hasn't changed a bit

72
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,900
Your phone is ringing

73
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,700
Not mine

74
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,900
You must rest. I'll take your leave

75
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
- Have tea with us
- Some other time

76
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Make sure you drop by

77
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,400
That's my ball

78
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Got it!

79
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,600
Mrs. Mehra is back

80
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,300
- How are you, Rajjo?
- You look lovely

81
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,600
Welcome to Delhi 6. How do you do?
I am Rajjo

82
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,400
Rama!

83
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Rama. Bless you

84
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,800
A local speciality

85
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,800
Home at last!

86
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,500
Roshan! Unlock the door

87
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,600
- Which one?
- The small one

88
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,100
The tulsi plant has dried. Some water

89
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
No water now

90
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,200
The tap runs only in the morning

91
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,100
It's like the government.
Works on a whim

92
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,300
Nothing like Mother Earth!

93
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,100
I was just 16

94
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,100
Your grandfather married me
and brought me here

95
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I'll leave the world from this place now

96
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Gran...

97
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
This way

98
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't waste water. It's precious

99
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,800
Overflowing with emotion.
That's the beauty of India for you

100
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,400
Love is never given in small doses

101
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Here, taps may run dry.
But amazingly tear ducts never do

102
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,400
Your grandfather! He never accepted
your parents' marriage

103
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
Never listened to anyone

104
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,700
"How is it possible?"

105
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,900
It chewed him up till he died

106
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,000
He'd say: "How can my son
marry a Muslim?"

107
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,700
I wasn't happy either

108
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,400
When I got to know your mother...

109
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,400
...I knew I was wrong

110
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,300
Damn it!

111
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
Must the power go now?

112
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,400
Your father was just as stubborn

113
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,400
My husband said: "Get out!"
So he left

114
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,700
And refused to come back

115
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,000
Except for once.
For your grandpa's funeral

116
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,200
See God's miracle, Roshan?

117
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,100
You were born on the same night

118
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,400
"Everything that happens is God's will"

119
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,500
Only his moustache sets you apart

120
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,000
You're still not ready?

121
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:44,200
Ravan is on his way to kidnap Sita

122
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
My scarf! Hey, mister

123
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,400
Can't you see? Shall I buy you specs?

124
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Gran!

125
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,500
Lord Ram was born in Awadh
to put an end to all suffering

126
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Salaams, Mrs. Mehra

127
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Mamdu? Right?

128
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,000
I can't enter without eating
something sweet, right?

129
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
How are you, Madangopal?

130
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,900
Well. Thanks to the Goddess

131
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,800
Bittu! Isn't she Bittu?

132
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,100
How thin you are.
You were once so chubby

133
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,100
You're a stick now

134
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
- Her American grandson
- Must I dance for joy?

135
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Roshan. She's Bittu. Their daughter

136
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,400
- 20 rupees from me
- And a donation of 50 from me

137
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,000
Why be stingy with
the Benevolent One? Right?

138
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,600
Miserly with his sister...

139
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,800
...but loves showing off in public

140
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,300
You brothers never stop fighting.
Have you no shame?

141
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
You look dashing!

142
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,900
Young man, not Miss. Mrs!

143
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Myself Jaigopal Sharma,
proprietor Jaigopal Electrical Works

144
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,500
I won the contract
for all the lighting. Right?

145
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,500
Donation, Mrs. Mehra

146
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,100
Gobar! Don't pester her. Come here.

147
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,800
What will you take?

148
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,100
One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

149
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,000
One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

150
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,600
One note? I'll take two coins

151
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
He's got straw for brains

152
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Time for a group photo.
Paswaan Lane! Stand close together

153
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,000
Are we in?

154
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,300
My star of Delhi-6. When are you
heading to Mumbai?

155
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,800
I can go anytime.
I'm giving the others a chance

156
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,200
Don't forget the 2500 you owe me!
Right?

157
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Jaigopalji, forget about me.
Tell me about your shirt. By God!

158
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,500
I had better visit Malayasia too

159
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,500
Look! The moneylender's wife
is decked out like his jewellery store

160
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,200
So our wives nag us
to buy the same jewels

161
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,800
Then pawn them right back to him

162
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,000
Let me photograph you
and your lovely wife

163
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Greetings, Annapurnaji

164
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,800
Pay your respects!

165
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
May you both live long!

166
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Lalaji! Meet Rajan's son.
Roshan

167
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,200
Are you here to stay?

168
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
No. I came to leave her

169
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,200
What's your name?

170
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
Roshan Mehra

171
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,000
Any plans for the house?

172
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Lalaji, I'm still alive!

173
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,400
- I'll fetch you a good price
- Can family heritage be sold?

174
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,400
There's no family left

175
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,400
Money is better than bricks and mortar.
Right, son?

176
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
You burger species!

177
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,900
With an arrow as sharp as His gaze

178
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,300
He stuck the golden deer

179
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,600
The golden deer
changed into the demon Marich

180
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,100
O Brother Laxman!
Ram is calling for help

181
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,800
As Laxman leaves,
the demon king Ravan appears

182
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,400
Sita hears his cry for alms!

183
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,700
The sage implores: "Give alms
in the name of God"

184
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,100
"God keep you well"

185
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,600
The sage insists: "Sita, step out of
the ring of fire. Hand me the offering"

186
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,600
As Sita stepped out,
the sage turned into the demon Ravan

187
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,000
You sinner! O Lord Ram, save me!

188
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,700
Ladiesand gentlemen

189
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,000
We are proud to welcome...

190
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
...Maitri Devi, the councillor for Delhi 6

191
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,800
The honourable lady is here

192
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
On behalf of the Ram Leela committee...

193
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,600
...we'd like to garland her

194
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,900
"May the rule of Ram reign forever.
I may die but I'll never break a promise!"

195
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,400
Lord Ram who sacrificed
everything in the name of duty...

196
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,500
...at His feet...

197
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,700
...I offer donation money
on behalf of my party and me

198
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,400
Please accept it

199
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,600
Join me when I say:
"Long live Ram and Sita!"

200
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,500
Long live Lord Hanuman!

201
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,300
Long live Maitri Devi!

202
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,400
In India, the gods dance
to the whims of politicians

203
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
I thoroughly enjoyed the Ram Leela

204
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,700
But even more fascinating
were the people

205
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,500
I was so exhausted.
But the real drama was yet to unfold

206
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,400
Hanuman! Go and see.
Two men have entered the forest

207
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,700
Hanuman! Where are you?

208
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,400
Where has Lord Hanuman gone?

209
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,600
Hanumanji, it's your cue.
They're looking for you

210
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,300
A monkey!

211
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,400
The Black Monkey!

212
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,500
The Black Monkey!

213
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,300
You slow poke

214
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,000
Manager! Come here

215
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,100
- Is he the one?
- No

216
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:11,400
Balls of a wimp! It's not him either.
Aren't you an expert at grabbing tails?

217
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,400
Carry on!

218
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,400
Whose phone is that?

219
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,700
Whose tail is ringing?

220
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Yes? Hello!

221
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,700
Inspector sir, the phone
belongs to Roshan

222
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,600
Roshan! I've found it
What species is he?

223
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,000
Sir, please let me go

224
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,300
Did I give you permission to stop?

225
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,900
Who's this?

226
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Roshan, let's go

227
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,300
Shall I slap his left cheek too?

228
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,800
Know who I am?

229
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,500
You must be a public servant

230
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,800
Balls of a wimp! Do I look like a servant?

231
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,500
There maybe few highways,
but there's always a way out

232
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,400
Thank you, Inspector sir

233
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,700
Mr Baig

234
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Tell him how the wind blows.
This is India

235
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,200
You bow to a uniform. No choice

236
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,600
What did you do?

237
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,300
I offered him a paan

238
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,000
Wrapped in a bank note

239
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,300
This is Delhi, my friend

240
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,200
Offering you nothing
but love and affection

241
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,600
Delhi is a place for those who love life

242
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,900
A place where crazed lovers live

243
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
It holds you in a tight embrace

244
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,800
It lets you hear its heartbeat

245
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,200
Hearts to your left

246
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,900
Hearts to your right

247
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
This is not a city but a gathering of lovers

248
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,100
This is Delhi, my friend

249
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,300
Offering you nothing
but love and affection

250
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
- Specs...
- Do I need them?

251
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,000
Why the toothpaste grin?

252
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,400
Sunita, the scene today is:
Show some flesh, hide some

253
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,400
You want 4x6? 5x7? Laminated?
You've wasted my whole day

254
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,000
I have beauty. I have heart.
Apretty face and I'm smart

255
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,500
Apretty face and I'm smart

256
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,100
I, Bittu Sharma, will be your
new Indian Idol

257
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,400
Loosen up! Relax.
Be a little sexy!

258
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,100
Hey mister, watch your step.
Tread carefully on the path of love

259
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,500
The path of love
is strewn with cheats

260
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,300
Not bad! You forgot your lipstick today

261
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,800
No, I didn't. It got rubbed off

262
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,700
When do my lips try that?

263
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,500
What?

264
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,900
Your hair!

265
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
Your hands are too frisky.
Control them

266
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,300
They have a will of their own.
What a dirty mind!

267
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,000
Maybe they want something

268
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Bittu, you never take me seriously

269
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
You'll appreciate me when
I make you an Indian Idol

270
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,900
Not a bad photographer.
You can cover my wedding

271
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
They're in black and white. No colour

272
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,100
- I see life in black and white
- But rainbows fill the Mumbai sky

273
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,300
Models! Money

274
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,100
I must make some money

275
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,500
But to make money you need money

276
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,500
Suresh!

277
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Lalaji!

278
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,000
What a coincidence!
I was coming to see you

279
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Your meter is ticking, Suresh

280
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,200
You owe me 166,000 rupees

281
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Didn't you get the cheque?
I'll clear our accounts at Diwali

282
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,600
You have a week

283
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,500
Or else... I think you get it

284
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,300
Got it! You look smart today.
May I take a photo?

285
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,400
Say "ah"

286
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,900
Gran!

287
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,400
Rama is gifted.
She'll brighten her in-laws' home

288
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,100
Her brothers' quarrelling is
spoiling her chance of marriage

289
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Damn their bickering!

290
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Soon she'll be too old to marry

291
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Age has nothing to do with finding love

292
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,300
When my beloved teases me,
sister-in-law ribs me

293
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,400
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

294
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,800
When mother-in-law taunts me,
brother-in-law consoles me

295
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,900
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

296
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,900
I left my parents' home
so I could belong to my beloved

297
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,500
My husband isa merchant.
He is leaving for the city

298
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,600
When I see him go, my heart sinks

299
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,300
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

300
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,800
I left my parent's home
so I could belong to my beloved

301
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,500
Wearinga bush shirt,
he happily chews paan

302
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,700
There is no one to match him
in all of Raipur

303
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,500
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

304
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,300
I can't swallow a thing

305
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,100
Eating too many betel nuts!
Who's there to stop you?

306
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,700
Aren't you Rama?

307
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Wow! You've never met us.
But you recognize us

308
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,200
The one and only Rajjo!

309
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,400
How do you do? Is all well with you?

310
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,600
Your son is a gem

311
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,700
He's one of us now

312
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,600
We're keeping him.
Don't say we didn't warn you!

313
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Keep him! He's yours anyway

314
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,300
You have a Delhi-6 heart.
Tangy and spicy! Like a Delhi snack

315
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Mother!

316
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,700
Call 911!

317
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,200
We're going to the hospital

318
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,900
Irwin Hospital!

319
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,500
Get out of the way!

320
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,100
Mamdu!

321
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,300
She's very unwell

322
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,000
What's wrong? Tie this to her wrist

323
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,900
Lord Hanuman will cure her

324
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,600
We won't let her fall sick

325
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,300
Gobar, clear the way!

326
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Why have they stopped?

327
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,300
What's going on?

328
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,900
Mother Cow is giving birth

329
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
Mother Cow giving baby cow

330
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,300
Move them out of the way. Go on!

331
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,100
Clear the road!

332
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,000
You're blessed to see
Mother Cow giving birth

333
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,300
Mother Cow is giving birth

334
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,300
Those who witness the birth
are freed of all misfortune

335
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,700
Here! Mother Cow has blessed you

336
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,200
Can prayer ever be stopped?

337
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,900
Mother Cow is giving birth.
People have gathered

338
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,400
How can the police intervene?

339
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,200
Step back! Everyone stand back!

340
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,300
Gran?

341
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,500
Move aside. Let us pass!

342
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,900
Your Gran is better already

343
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,100
Mother Cow's miracle!

344
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,600
Her sugar level had dropped
and she fainted

345
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,300
She's fine now

346
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Back in America, we thought
Gran had no one in Delhi

347
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,000
But everyone here is family

348
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
Gran is dying, Ali Uncle

349
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,300
The poet Zauq says:

350
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,800
"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

351
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

352
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,300
Just stay

353
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,600
Stay as you are

354
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,700
You are pain

355
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,200
You are comfort

356
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,300
A gentle breeze

357
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,200
A stormy obsession

358
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,200
Smooth as silk. Jagged as rough cloth

359
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,700
Sometimes you quarrel.
Sometimes you're stubborn

360
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,300
So full of fragrance

361
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,900
I don't want to change you an inch

362
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,800
Without adornment. Without impurity.
No more. No less

363
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,900
I love you just as you are

364
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,300
All yours

365
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,400
In your rainfall,
I want to dissolve

366
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,500
In your flame,
I want to burn and turn to ash

367
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,100
If you wound me,
soothe me with a balm

368
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,700
I will soon love the wound you inflict

369
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,800
You are a river. Let me drown in you

370
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,700
Your father and I had a great time
when we were young

371
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,300
No wife and children. A girl-friend?

372
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,600
Just the one

373
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,000
Your father took her away

374
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,000
My mother?

375
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,400
25 years ago, if I had told Fatima
"I love you"

376
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,900
I might have a son like you today

377
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,000
But dreams only blossomed
In my heart

378
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,100
Your father had guts

379
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,700
He loved her madly.
He fought everyone

380
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,000
Not caring what they said
about Fatima being a Muslim

381
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,600
He fought for love

382
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,500
When I look at you,
I see that love

383
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,500
In your eyes and in the way you talk

384
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,400
But then I know...

385
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,800
...you will leave us too

386
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,900
Back to America

387
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,700
My life is there

388
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,200
All my pleas are written on my face

389
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,500
What can I ask of You, O Master?

390
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,800
You already know what is in my heart

391
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,600
O Master! My Master

392
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,900
Cracks blemish the line of my destiny

393
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,200
Repair my fate, O Master

394
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:47,300
Repair my fate, O Master

395
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,500
He who comes to Your threshold
comes to bow his head

396
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,900
He came with throat parched.
And found an overflowing river

397
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,100
He returned bathed in the shower
of Your light

398
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,000
The rich always buy the best urns.
501. 95 paisa. Just feel it

399
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,100
Do you have a gold urn?
With gems and rubies

400
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,400
Why show off in death?

401
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Why save if you're going forever?

402
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,400
A copper urn. 251.95 paisa

403
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,700
I want a clay urn for my ashes.
Or I'm off

404
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,500
You're so old-fashioned. Here you are

405
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Especially made from sacred Ganges clay

406
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,600
- 151.95 paisa
- This is good

407
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,000
Roshan, hold it

408
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,700
Now I can die in peace

409
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,100
Here you are

410
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,800
Only 100?

411
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,500
Be happy

412
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,400
"The tree said to the leaf:
Listen to what I say:

413
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,200
"This is the cycle of life:
A leaf dies. Another is born"

414
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,600
I first thought it odd that Gran
was making these arrangements

415
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,600
A bit morbid

416
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,900
Who goes shopping for your
own funeral? Discussing death like this

417
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,400
I suppose we can't decide the manner
in which we are born

418
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,600
But we can plan our departure

419
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
The rainy season is over. Autumn is here

420
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,900
Yet I have had no word of Sita

421
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,400
It pains Laxman to see
His brother suffering

422
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,200
He longs to take away his pain

423
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,700
Fresh attacks in Delhi 6

424
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,900
The dark shadow of the Black Monkey
is cast all over Delhi

425
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,000
My heart stopped when I saw it.
It had bulbs on its chest

426
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,000
When I touched it,
I got a 500 volt shock!

427
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,100
Oh my God!

428
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,300
The earth gets its energy from the sun

429
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,600
But the monster Black Monkey's energy
is far greater

430
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,500
It can attack any time

431
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,900
They're all fools

432
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
The Black Monkey...

433
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,700
It tore her saree...

434
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,900
Do you want to be the next Indian Idol?

435
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,400
The Indian Idol bus is coming
to your town!

436
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
You pierced your navel?

437
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,800
Sexy, eh? I had it done yesterday

438
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,100
- It must have hurt
- Nothing gained without pain

439
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,400
If the Black Monkey has glowing lights
on its chest...

440
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,000
...it means it has a mother board

441
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,800
An electrical circuit. Right?

442
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,200
Leave him alone

443
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,000
Don't bore him with your theories

444
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,000
Young man! What happens when
Water enters an electrical circuit?

445
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,800
Right! Well done!
Hear that, Rajjo?

446
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,500
He's smarter than us

447
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,200
Made in America! Right?

448
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,700
So, if you see the Black Monkey's
mother board, pour water on it

449
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,600
Short circuit! Finished!

450
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,800
The end of the Black Monkey. Right?

451
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,100
Brilliant. It's time to leave

452
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,700
I'm not blowing my own trumpet.
But no one can touch me in electronics

453
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,200
Only father's old radio is beyond me

454
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,600
Until I hear a sound from it,
I won't give up

455
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I'll see you at the prayer meeting

456
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,700
Good you're arranging a prayer meeting.
The Goddess will bless us

457
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,800
Hail to the Goddess!

458
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,400
Sister-in-law!

459
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,800
I don't know what he was telling Roshan

460
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Something about the Black Monkey's mother
Sitting for a board exam

461
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,700
Pour water on it

462
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,900
He said pour water on it
and it's dead

463
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,100
But where do we get
so much water?

464
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,500
This chilli!

465
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,600
- Let Bobby play with me
- Stop it!

466
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,000
- What is it?
- Some sweets

467
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,000
Why? Has Mother Cow given birth?

468
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,900
No! Granny is well again. So we're
organizing a prayer meeting

469
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,900
I just came out of the toilet.
My handsare unwashed

470
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,500
Leave it inside

471
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,700
You're the wife of Madangopal Electrical.
How can you be so dumb?

472
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,800
You're from America, right?

473
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Lightning strikes when it rains?
Yes? It does. Right?

474
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,300
Does lightning cause
the clouds to short-circuit?

475
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,200
- Never heard such a thing
- Neither have I

476
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,100
Throwing water on the Black Monkey
won't help

477
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,600
Stop that damn racket!

478
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,000
Do you think the Black Monkey
is a son of an ass?

479
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,200
A big hero!

480
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,000
Talking rot to the women

481
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,900
Uncle is right, father

482
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,900
My science teacher told us
about short circuits

483
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:31,000
Shut up! Son of an ass!
When you're my age, then talk big!

484
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,700
- Must you shout in front of Roshan?
- Mummy, I'm going out

485
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,700
Serve some lunch to Mrs. Mehra.
Then go to college

486
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,700
Pour water on the monkey? Ha!

487
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,600
You Americans think you own everything

488
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,200
You force your way everywhere.
Into any country

489
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,600
So shameless. You Americans
never ask for permission

490
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,400
What's the big deal?

491
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,900
It's a big deal for us.
We never cross the line

492
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,500
You burger species!

493
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,500
You know why the Black Monkey
wears shades?

494
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,700
- How would I know?
- It's stylish, boss!

495
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,100
You're smoking Indian cigarettes
when I'm around?

496
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,900
Try this, sir. Imported

497
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,400
Special filter

498
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,200
Is that so?

499
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,400
What a waste

500
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Bobby, come here

501
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,800
Well, Mr Bobby? You'll get 90%
in your exams this time. Right?

502
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,600
No. 100%

503
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,100
Bravo!

504
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,700
Pulling your uncle's leg! Right?

505
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,300
Who started this round?

506
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,300
Ok! There's a beggar sitting
round the corner

507
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,700
Give this to him

508
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,600
That's my boy!

509
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,000
- What are you doing?
- I'll do what I want

510
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,700
Shall we go in?

511
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,900
- Those damn ghosts live there
- Go on!

512
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,200
You come too. Big mouth!

513
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,500
Don't be a kid. We're grown up now

514
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,800
- What if we're caught?
- No one enters Dead Souls' Lane

515
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,400
They say scary spirits roam here

516
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
Mummy says cigarettes are bad

517
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,100
But your father smokes

518
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,600
You coward!

519
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,000
- I'm no coward
- That's more like it!

520
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,200
In Delhi 6, Jalebi helps boys
become men

521
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,900
Jalebi? She's of a lower caste

522
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,900
- So what!
- I'll ask Mummy

523
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,500
You son of an ass! You can't ask
Mummy about everything

524
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
Now we're men

525
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,800
Sister! The garbage

526
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,900
Old letch!

527
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:36,000
You girl thief! You'll be dancing like a peacock
when I shove my broom...

528
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
The garbage!

529
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,200
Mrs. Mehra, the flowers

530
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,000
Go in

531
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,200
Simpleton!

532
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,700
Turn us into men

533
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,600
Who told you I could do that?

534
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,300
- Everyone knows
- Sonny, you still wet your pants

535
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,900
Still drinking milk.
You'll be men?

536
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,000
We're grown up. We want to be men

537
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,200
I'll call your mother

538
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,700
Be men!

539
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,900
Damn it!

540
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,100
Wretched parents!
Spoiling their children

541
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,000
The garbage!

542
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,000
In the name of Lord Ram!

543
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,900
Disaster!

544
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,500
What have you done?

545
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,900
Pure of body. Pure of spirit

546
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,700
- Take your clothes off
- You wish!

547
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,000
So what if Jalebi is human!
She's of a lower caste

548
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,000
You have to bathe. Come on

549
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,500
Roshan, listen to him.
Do as I say, son

550
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,800
Shabri, why do you hesitate?

551
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,100
Give me a berry to eat

552
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,100
She tastes the berries and offers
the sweetest to Lord Ram

553
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,200
Without hesitation,
Lord Ram eats berry after berry

554
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,500
Shabri is of a lower caste. Why is
He eating berries she has tasted?

555
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,600
To Lord Ram, one is inferior
or superior by birth

556
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,200
Ramji is God.
He is permitted everything

557
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,200
Rambihari

558
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,700
I need company. Bring Jalebi to me

559
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,700
The boss wants you

560
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,100
The key is here

561
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,300
Come on

562
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,700
You wretch! I'll fix you

563
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,300
- Stand up!
- I'm not going with you

564
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,600
Tell him that!

565
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,600
The police!

566
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,300
The Black Monkey?

567
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,700
Hail to the Black Monkey!

568
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,300
Where did the balls of the wimp go?

569
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,300
Who?

570
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,500
The Black Monkey! Who else?
Not asking about your father

571
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,600
Pass me the fog horn!

572
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,000
You Black Monkey

573
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,100
Your game is up.
We have surrounded the place

574
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,100
Be reasonable,
Or else we will shoot you

575
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,900
- He tore through the roof
- He must have springs for feet

576
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,600
You saw it?
What does it look like?

577
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,700
Who?
- The Black Monkey! Who else?

578
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,500
Why are you winding us up?

579
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,600
If he's invisible,
how can he be seen?

580
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,300
The moron drives well too!

581
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,500
Before I knew it...

582
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,600
...I was adding
to the Black Monkey's saga

583
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,100
Because of me, it is now invisible

584
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,300
In the dark of the night, wearing a dark suit
and dark glasses...

585
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,900
...the Black Monkey drives a black Sumo

586
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,800
Once its dark deeds are done...

587
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,700
...it presses a red button...

588
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,800
And becomes invisible!

589
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,100
It's an alien

590
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,300
It attacked two girls in our area.
They were sleeping

591
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,400
We gave chase. But it disappeared

592
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,600
This monkey is driving us crazy

593
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,700
The albatross emits many sounds
while it is mating

594
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,600
If you breathe deeply,
it'll benefit you in every way

595
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,300
Great importance is given
in Yoga to breathing

596
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,700
Many Sumo cars were destroyed
in Delhi

597
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,900
But this Sumo belonged
to the Black Monkey

598
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,900
- Have you seen the Black Monkey?
- Yes! It's invisible

599
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,000
It is an animal.
Animals aren't in our jurisdiction

600
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Not a case for us

601
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,900
A monkey?

602
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,500
A criminal!

603
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,000
Hurrah! The vehicle has lifted off!

604
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,600
The monkey is an animal.
Not our jurisdiction!

605
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,600
So? Will you do nothing?

606
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,800
Pointing fingers at us won't help

607
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,300
Look at our track record

608
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,400
We are most capable

609
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,400
Utter rot!

610
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,500
This case is for the Animal Ministry.
They must take action

611
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,600
Move! Go home and watch TV

612
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,700
Have you ever seen an animal
with a mother board?

613
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,600
Springs for feet?

614
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,900
No! So how does it concern
the Animal Ministry?

615
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,500
Talk to the Science and
Technology Ministry

616
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:04,000
If they stopped lining their pockets,
they'd have time for us

617
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,500
How right you are!

618
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,000
Madangopalji! It's from the shrine

619
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,900
I'm Jaigopal!
For once get my name right

620
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,400
Look! Look into the mirror

621
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,400
In every speck shines His light

622
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,000
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

623
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,200
If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

624
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,100
That's true worship

625
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,300
Look into the mirror!

626
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,600
Salaams to you!

627
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,000
He's a fine boy

628
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,300
Haji Mian!

629
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Roshan slapped the Inspector last night

630
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,500
"You public servant"

631
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,400
"Do you know who I am?"

632
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,500
"You look like a public servant"

633
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,100
"Servant? Do I look like a servant?"

634
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,900
Then our Roshan, tall as...

635
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,700
...the Qutub Minar, swung his arm...

636
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,900
Did I give you permission to stop?
Carry on!

637
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,200
I explained. "Roshan is new in town... "

638
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,100
The Inspector can fix anyone

639
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,000
Masakali! Come

640
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,900
Come here, my child

641
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,100
Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!

642
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,200
Spread your wings and set the dust free.
Fly high! And higher still

643
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,900
Fly over cities, lanes and towns

644
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,500
Fly with grace on your wings.
Follow your heart's every desire

645
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,600
Blend with the wind. Stylish and swift.
Fly away, you gem

646
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:09,100
A colony of clouds is your lovely abode

647
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,200
Turn your head away from
those who can't fly

648
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,500
Fly! Do not be afraid

649
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,100
Do as you please. As you please

650
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,300
Fly away. Don't look back.
Smile as you spread your wings

651
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,000
Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!

652
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,800
What do you care about sorrow?
All you hear is the flute in the sky

653
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,100
The wind talking

654
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,700
The sun shining

655
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,500
Fly away! Never fear

656
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,400
Do as you please. As you please

657
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,400
Fly away. Don't look back

658
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,300
Smile as you spread your wings, Masakali

659
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,600
What's it to you?

660
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,300
Bittu! My child

661
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,900
I'll pour it in his tea.
Then swallow some myself

662
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,200
End of story

663
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,800
- Whose tea?
- That bloated haystack!

664
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,800
He wants to check me out. Marry me

665
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,100
Check you out?

666
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,200
You find us so amusing

667
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,100
What's wrong?

668
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,800
I don't want to get married.
But I don't have a choice

669
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,400
I'll have to walk a little.
Sing a little.

670
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,100
Pretend I cooked the samosas
Aunt Rama made. The perfect wife!

671
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,600
Hurry! Papa is about to have a fit

672
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,200
Yuck!

673
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,700
If you don't want to get married,
tell them your point of view

674
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,300
Who can dare talk to father?

675
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,700
They're made for each other.
Like Ram and Sita!

676
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,500
The princess arrives!

677
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,900
May I have a word? It's urgent

678
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,200
Not now. We have guests

679
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,600
I said later!

680
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,300
Do have something

681
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,600
Bittu doesn't want to marry him

682
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,200
You insolent boy!
Remember your place

683
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,500
She can't tell you.
Because she's scared of you

684
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,100
I said get out!

685
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,500
Bittu was going to drink rat poison.
And mix it in the tea

686
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,800
I am Sameer Abbas.
You're watching IBN-7

687
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,500
Breaking news from Delhi 6

688
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,700
This is what the Black Monkey looks like

689
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,800
The Delhi police offer a reward
of 50.000

690
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,500
The Black Monkey is the latest rage

691
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,200
No doubt about it.
That's what it looks like

692
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,900
Delhi is gripped by fear

693
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,200
People are so scared

694
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,800
Breaking news from Old Delhi!

695
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
In Delhi 6, pregnant woman fell
to her death as she ran down the stairs

696
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:10,400
She panicked when she heard people
say the Black Monkey was back

697
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,200
Fear of the Black Monkey
has caused another death

698
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,500
What is the Black Monkey?

699
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,100
Everyone in Delhi fears it

700
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,700
Is it some sort of plot?

701
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,100
Hey! The Black Monkey!

702
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,700
Is it inside? Or is it out?
