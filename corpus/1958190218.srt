1
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,305
- When are you gonna
tell me what's inside?

2
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,432
- Mary, I'll explain it to
you when you're old enough

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:21,102
to understand the eternal
mystery of transubstantiation.

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:21,980
- Please, Father.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,067
- It's the body of Christ.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,317
- The one we use at mass?

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,694
- Yes, indeed.

8
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,778
Now leave me be,

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,032
I need to finish this
homily before Sunday.

10
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,694
You let God out!

11
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,717
- Please, Father.

12
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,636
Can I come back in? It's
freezing!

13
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,137
- I'll let you sleep in the
attic

14
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,056
if you can recite for me
Leviticus chapter three.

15
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,101
- I, I can't.

16
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,173
- Mary, come on.

17
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,007
Come on.

18
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,383
Let's get up.

19
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,219
Mary?

20
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,180
Mary?

21
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,930
- I just wanted to let
you know how awful it was

22
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,016
what happened to you today.

23
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,183
- Oh, nevermind that.

24
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm really into this novel right
now.

25
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,187
You should go back to sleep.

26
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,024
- What happened?

27
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,192
- Just Father Munhauser, the
bastard.

28
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,279
He scolded me again for no good
reason.

29
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,533
- Still, neither of you have
yet to be paddled by him.

30
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,617
- I heard he's responsible

31
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,202
for that poor student's
death a few years ago.

32
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,371
Did he beat her to death?

33
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,291
I only ask because he's
known for severe abuse,

34
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,626
but he can only punish you

35
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,961
if your parents give him
permission,

36
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,923
like yours did.

37
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,175
- It was a failed exorcism.

38
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,513
The girl, Mary, her name
was, she started acting,

39
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,727
you know, demonic, possessed.

40
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,854
I mean, some say that she was
just going through puberty,

41
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,566
but he thought she was going
mad.

42
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,192
- Poor Mary.

43
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,444
I wish there was some
way we could get revenge.

44
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,864
Kill that son of a bitch.

45
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,490
- Stop, it's all just
hearsay, speculation.

46
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:49,705
Besides, I thought he was
a good guy before today.

47
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,623
- I know where it happened.

48
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,083
It was in his cabin.

49
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,795
He enslaved her there to
do experiments on her.

50
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,463
- We have to go.

51
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,715
How far is it from here?

52
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,592
- About a day's hike.

53
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,719
- Let's break out of
here.

54
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,721
How's this plot compared
to the one you're reading?

55
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,222
- I only read romance

56
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,432
and you guys can go enjoy it by
yourselves

57
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,101
and have fun getting locked up.

58
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,894
- No one's gonna be there.

59
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,396
It's vacant this time of year.

60
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,442
- Well, I guess I'd rather
be in prison than here.

61
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,721
- Isn't it just charming?

62
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,640
You know, I could spend
the rest of my life

63
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,016
in a little place like this.

64
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,851
- No way!

65
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,520
Why would anyone with your
ambition

66
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,729
wanna spend their whole life

67
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,733
in a place out in the country
like this?

68
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,809
- Nope, nope, can't do it.

69
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,686
It reeks of religion in there.

70
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,939
- Hey, maybe we'll find his wine

71
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,570
and tune into Dallas
playing the Super Bowl!

72
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,740
Oh.

73
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:32,200
- Girls, I found letters.

74
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,370
We have to read them.

75
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,505
- He tried for weeks,

76
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,009
every night until she cried
blood and ate nothing.

77
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,223
- Deliver her, be gone evil, be
gone.

78
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,059
I cast you out in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

79
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:02,188
Be gone, be gone in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

80
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,439
You are crushed under his foot.

81
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,650
You are crushed under his heel.

82
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,037
- Some say this is where

83
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,166
it took a darker turn for the
worst.

84
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,958
Everyone knows what he did to
her,

85
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,961
but it wasn't for selfish
reasons.

86
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,591
It was his final method
to draw the evil out.

87
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,803
- He hoped it
would flee from her body

88
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,306
and inhabit his instead.

89
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,306
But being a priest,

90
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,266
he didn't know the first thing
about women

91
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,313
except how to punish them
when they misbehaved.

92
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,182
- It's unclear what
happened next.

93
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,560
Some believe he impregnated
her and killed her

94
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,981
to save his reputation
at the Reform Academy.

95
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,401
- Let's just bury
the bird real quick.

96
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,912
- Hey, who the hell is that?

97
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,499
- Just looking for a shovel.

98
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,459
- Y'all trespassing.

99
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,502
- Uh-uh, this here's forest
land.

100
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,462
We know our rights!

101
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,671
- That may be true.

102
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,298
You can mess around the grounds
here,

103
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,679
but that there cabin is
somebody's private getaway.

104
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,724
- Hey, you all Manhauer's
nieces or something?

105
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:01,892
- Yeah, that's right.

106
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,185
- Wait, I know you.

107
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,147
Aren't you the janitor
from St. Catherine's?

108
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,691
- That's right, I'm Nestor.

109
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,196
I take care of the grounds.
pull weeds and such.

110
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,784
- You helped me untie
the knot on my shoe once.

111
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,077
Peeked up my skirt too.

112
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,121
- I get in eyefuls when I can.

113
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,831
Like right now.

114
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,500
And a word of warning,

115
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,627
keep away from the stinging
nettles

116
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,462
and don't dig in the ground for
nothing.

117
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,216
This here is sacred Indian
burial ground.

118
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,969
- Those are
my people, we're fine.

119
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,851
- Snazzy place.

120
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,979
I wasn't expecting it
to be this nice, right?

121
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,856
- Hey, at least he's got some
good records

122
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,069
because I was jonesing for a
groove.

123
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,592
- Oh, something weird's
happened at the neighbors.

124
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,343
- So what are we doing about
dinner?

125
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,344
- I don't know.

126
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,930
There's some mutant animal
parts in the freezer.

127
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,724
Maybe you can make a soup.

128
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,141
- You're sick.

129
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,020
How about some split pea soup?

130
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,355
- That will keep us warm
tonight.

131
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,482
- You know what else would keep
us warm?

132
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,360
A fire!

133
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,988
I'll get the kindling.

134
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,517
- Here, snap a real good one of
me.

135
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,524
- Sure!

136
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,237
- Jeez, Lori, you're
built like a brick house.

137
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,783
- Thank you.

138
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,594
- That's my swing.

139
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,930
- So very sorry.

140
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:09,808
I'm Jodi.

141
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,644
What's your name?

142
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,605
- I don't remember.

143
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,984
- Oh.

144
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,444
So you live around here or?

145
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,320
- I died here

146
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,115
and death is near you and
all you filthy whores.

147
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,721
- Jodi, what happened?

148
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,807
- It was horrible.

149
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,601
There was a girl there!

150
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,645
It was a demon, it was a demon!

151
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,478
- Come on now.

152
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,980
You're just trying to get us

153
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,942
in the mood for some ghost
stories.

154
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,819
- No, no, it really happened!

155
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,989
- Maybe it was an apparition?

156
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:07,948
- Uh-uh.

157
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,659
Sounds like someone found the
shine and it had a good sip.

158
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,329
- Maybe we should just
play a game or something?

159
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,540
- This isn't time for charades!

160
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,920
We need to tear this place up
for clues.

161
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,964
- There's no way we could
read through all the letters.

162
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,700
- Who do you think they are?
- Victims.

163
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,288
- Lori, that's not funny!

164
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,375
Who are you calling?

165
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,920
- My boyfriend, Braddock.

166
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,005
- Boyfriend? That's a laugh.

167
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,214
- You've just never met him.

168
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,465
He's a dream.

169
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,425
Wish he was here right now.

170
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,011
- We've already been in enough
trouble.

171
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,638
We don't need men.

172
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,015
I mean, we're already
playing hooky anyway.

173
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,850
- Ugh, you're right.

174
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,727
We're basically fugitives
already.

175
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,061
We might as well just leave.

176
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,689
Go back, face the music.

177
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,816
- Nestor's already seen us.

178
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,736
We should just ride this train
out 'til the end of the line.

179
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:31,031
I mean, we gotta find some
closure.

180
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,660
Besides, it's all just
rumors right now anyway.

181
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,870
- Not if it's written down.

182
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,497
I think I just found his
journal.

183
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,332
"I've been trying to recall the
days.

184
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,043
"The nights feel eternal.

185
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,795
"As I fail to know the
improvements

186
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,379
"I've made in the poor girl,

187
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,550
"the convulsions only
worsen a withering soul.

188
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,635
"Only more sickened by the
surroundings

189
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:55,140
"and the perhaps ill will
of her strange mother."

190
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,729
- This may take some
getting used to, Mary,

191
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,481
but we wanna shield you from the
evil

192
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,779
and the sin of this wicked
world.

193
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,238
- I
have doubts in my mind

194
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,323
about her parenting.

195
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:17,452
Forcing snake oil,
alternative medicines on her,

196
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,788
who has claimed she found
her recipes in dreams

197
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,625
where witch doctors appeared to
her

198
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,461
Native savages nonetheless,

199
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,004
I'm now convinced her secret
family potion

200
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,632
made of moss and elderberry

201
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,719
could only hasten the
subject's disposition.

202
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:46,149
- We need to speak about Mary,
dear.

203
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,110
- My own concerns matter little

204
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,319
because I'm really a humble
servant

205
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,196
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

206
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,991
But Mary, she's troubling me.

207
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,537
Always walking around
town like a common tart.

208
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,246
I wonder where she learned that
from?

209
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:05,542
- Are you referring to
me?

210
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:09,170
- And always making a
mockery during the mass,

211
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,549
yawning incessantly when I give
the homily

212
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,971
and when I lift up the Holy
Eucharist, incessant giggles.

213
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:17,804
It's, it's a mockery.

214
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:21,057
And her knees always
exposed like a temptress.

215
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,643
- If you weren't so cheap,

216
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:25,436
she wouldn't have such
an ill-fitting uniform.

217
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,354
- All right, enough.

218
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,314
In first Timothy, he talks about
how women

219
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,026
shouldn't be permitted
to speak in to church.

220
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,363
He should have extended
that to the household.

221
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,744
- Well, we need to make
a decision tonight.

222
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:43,413
- Okay, I've decided.

223
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,916
Mary no longer goes to school.

224
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,294
You could teach her at home.

225
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,557
- Tithes and offerings?

226
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,851
Holy mackerel!

227
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,102
- No.

228
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,729
I didn't know the old man was
loaded.

229
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,897
There must be at least $500
there.

230
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,400
- Try twice that.

231
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,235
- You know, if we had a bookie,

232
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,028
we could put it all on the
Cowboys to win.

233
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,739
- Gambling's a sin.

234
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:01,658
Also, we already
have enough bad luck as it is.

235
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,951
- We could change our names.

236
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,953
Ooh, hide out in L.A.

237
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,873
- Now you're talking.

238
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,040
We could get our nails done

239
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,043
and go shopping like
sophisticated ladies.

240
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,128
- Oh, this is perfect.

241
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,588
Now I'll be all ready
for that new magazine

242
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,256
I was telling you about.

243
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,092
- Hustlers?
- Yep, they're gonna love me.

244
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,094
- Yeah, and all the mules who
read it.

245
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,724
- I just have to submit some
more fees.

246
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,434
- This isn't you.

247
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,271
- It's me.

248
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,655
What?

249
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:40,616
- It's Mary.

250
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,701
Look.

251
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,453
- Ugh, I don't, I don't like
this one bit.

252
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,288
- No, no, no, no, no.

253
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,122
This is a good thing.

254
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,667
I mean, she wasn't in any of
the photos with the victims.

255
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,797
So this means she's here with
us.

256
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,760
She wants us to be here.

257
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,960
It definitely isn't
animal, maybe pelvic bone?

258
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,837
- It's her remains, isn't it?

259
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,923
- No, remember Nestor's warning?

260
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,758
It has to be a native's.

261
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,302
- Well, if we didn't
awaken a spirit before,

262
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,931
we definitely have now.

263
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,225
What was that?

264
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,645
- It sounded like a gunshot.

265
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,607
- Should we go check it
out?

266
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,191
- I think it's Lori's turn to
go.

267
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,320
- Fine, we'll all go.

268
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,205
- Someone's over there.

269
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,708
- Show yourself!

270
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,044
- Oh god, this guy again.

271
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:19,838
- Evening, ma'ams.

272
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,758
- Nestor, you scared us.

273
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,635
- What the hell are you
doing holding a gun?

274
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,887
- Yeah, evil spirits can't die
from that.

275
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,515
- Yeah, but the critters can.

276
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:32,100
I'm hankering for a gumbo.

277
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,647
- Something's there!

278
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:39,900
- That's the one that casts no
shadow.

279
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,360
- It just looks like a normal
cat.

280
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,862
- I think that's a bobcat.

281
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,740
- I'm gonna get me a $10 pelt.

282
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:48,992
That'll be 22 this year.

283
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,204
- No! Stop!

284
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,215
It's just a sweet little pussy.

285
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,384
- Oh my gosh, how cute!

286
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,218
- Yeah, that's not a bobcat.

287
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,388
- She wouldn't hurt anyone.

288
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:12,851
Want some milk?

289
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:18,271
- Oh, so sweet.

290
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,942
So demonic.

291
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,777
- Well, I'm bushed.

292
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,280
I think I'm gonna go lay down.

293
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,364
- Bye, baby!

294
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,706
- Maybe we should go talk to
Nestor.

295
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,497
- No, he's crazy!

296
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,585
- Yeah, but he might know
something about this place.

297
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,630
- Pssh, I do not wanna
get shot.

298
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:46,758
- If we get shot, we get shot
together.

299
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,344
- Uh, okay.

300
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,560
- Who's that?

301
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:59,312
- It's us, the pretty girls
you've been spying on.

302
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,524
- Oh, hello there.

303
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,233
- Hi.

304
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:04,862
- Oh, hold on, let me get
decent.

305
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:08,949
Okay.

306
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,164
- So anyway,

307
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,791
why do you live in the
shed like some creep

308
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,377
when you could be living in that
cabin?

309
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,211
It's right there.

310
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,839
- Well, this here's the
groundskeepers quarters

311
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:29,175
and I'm the faithful
groundskeeper

312
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,053
and I prefer staying out here

313
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:37,225
and I ain't never going
inside that cabin again.

314
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,145
- So you know about Mary?

315
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,396
- Shh!

316
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,275
Don't ever say her name, foolish
girls.

317
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:49,406
The more you blabber, the
more she'll haunt your souls.

318
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,246
- Well, that was weird.

319
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,627
- Maybe we should listen to his
warning.

320
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,760
- Ugh, you're not sleepy, are
you?

321
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,929
Yep, that Peg is such a party
pooper.

322
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,431
- I couldn't sleep a wink here.

323
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,726
We still have a million
questions
that need to be answered.

324
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,146
- That's why I brought this.

325
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,106
Oh, mystical magic eight ball.

326
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,778
Did Father Munhauser really
torture her?

327
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,739
My sources say no.

328
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,449
Okay.

329
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:35,828
Did he cause her death?

330
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,164
Better not tell you now.

331
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:44,417
- That stupid toy's not gonna
give us the answers we need.

332
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,752
We need to find something of
hers

333
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,422
that we can speak to her
through.

334
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,006
- Yet there's nothing here

335
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,383
but ineligible scribblings
on false teachings

336
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,430
and pseudosciences.

337
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:59,142
We haven't searched the attic
yet.

338
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
You take a look while I finish

339
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,395
combing through his journal some
more.

340
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,566
- Fine.

341
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:26,752
Ow!

342
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:35,969
It's okay, it's okay.

343
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,517
We're here to help you and
reveal the truth and all that.

344
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:45,272
- Please won't you bring
me a glass of milk?

345
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,026
- Yeah, yeah, I can do that.

346
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,532
- And it better not be
buttermilk!

347
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,409
You were sent here for me to
kill!

348
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,977
- You can sleep inside tonight.

349
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,145
But remember,

350
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,147
your father promised
to cut your tongue out

351
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,817
if you spoke at the dinner table
again.

352
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,793
- What's wrong?

353
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,837
- My dad cooked all the eggs for
breakfast

354
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,256
and made me eat them.

355
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,778
- Did you see my favorite
marble?

356
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,321
It's a yellow one.

357
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,825
- I'm sorry I haven't.

358
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,085
- Eat my mushy!

359
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:35,883
Eat my mushy!

360
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:42,012
Eat my mushy!

361
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:45,641
Eat my mushy!

362
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:57,944
- Repent to the Lord, I draw you
out.

363
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,154
- No, no!

364
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,155
- Say the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ.

365
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,823
The Lord Jesus Christ who died

366
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,116
and on the third day rose from
the dead

367
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,325
and who according to the
scriptures

368
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:05,368
is the right hand of God.

369
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,703
Say his name, the Lord Jesus
Christ!

370
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,790
in the name of the Mother
Mary, mother of God.

371
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:10,832
Say her name!

372
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,585
The Lord God Yahweh, sayeth
thee!

373
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:14,711
Yahweh!

374
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:15,837
- Yahweh!

375
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,838
- I anoint thee

376
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,549
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

377
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:20,091
Be gone, evil spirit!

378
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,092
Be gone, foul spirit!

379
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,886
Be gone! Be gone!

380
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:23,887
- No!

381
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,890
Why?

382
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,397
- I'm sorry, Mother.

383
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,857
- You know the order.

384
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,194
First bath for father, second
bath for me.

385
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,364
And the last bath for you, Mary.

386
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,704
- No, don't make me eat
anymore.

387
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:50,332
- More moths, Mary.

388
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:52,916
- How dare
you

389
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,085
bring toys to the dining room
table?

390
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,753
- Baby was hungry too,
Papa.

391
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,339
Why do you have to destroy my
doll?

392
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,882
- Wasn't the bed of
leaves

393
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,596
that you raked this morning
a cozy enough bed for you?

394
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:24,322
- And what God hath joined
together,

395
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:26,201
let no man put asunder.

396
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,955
Nestor, you may kiss your bride.

397
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,253
- No!

398
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,232
- Okay, we sound terrible.

399
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,194
Let's try something else.

400
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:06,825
Oh, spirit of thy young and
innocent lamb.

401
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,913
Let it be known that we shan't
hurt you.

402
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,542
- Yes, we are here to set you
free.

403
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,210
- Huh?

404
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:19,547
It's working.

405
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,636
Lori, I can sense her sadness.

406
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,057
- Peggy, what the heck?

407
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:32,891
- It was horrifying!

408
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,475
It was like a nightmare but
real!

409
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,227
I swear it really happened!

410
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,772
- Sounds like we have a
sleepwalker in denial.

411
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,607
- Jodi, you know me best.

412
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:42,442
Have I ever slept walked my
life?

413
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,486
- Well, a lot of weird stuff
has been going on here,

414
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,950
so I believe you.

415
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,577
- Maybe you dosed us with some
good LSD.

416
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:53,620
Yep, for all I know you're
the one going around

417
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:56,540
pulling pranks on us
while she's been asleep.

418
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,043
- Come on, just sit down.

419
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,714
- Oh my gosh.

420
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:05,591
Jodi, your wrist.

421
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:06,550
- It's nothing!

422
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,927
- We gotta get something to put
on that.

423
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,555
I'll be right back.

424
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:12,725
- Oh, come on.

425
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,833
- Aw, hey little fella.

426
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:44,045
Aw, you're so cute.

427
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,527
- Girls.

428
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:09,322
Girls, I found this.

429
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,199
- Her stuff.

430
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,745
- What more could we ask for?

431
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,372
- This must be her diary.

432
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:22,083
- Maybe you should put on the
nightgown.

433
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,251
- This old thing?

434
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,795
- I double dog dare ya.

435
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:25,754
- Ew, gross!

436
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,172
I am not wearing this.

437
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,132
It smells like...

438
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:29,968
- Death.

439
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:53,114
- Mary, this was your
grandmother's rosary

440
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,283
and now that you're 16 years
old,

441
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,995
I think she'd want you to have
it.

442
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,169
- Oh my God!

443
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,009
She wants me to read this alone.

444
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:26,108
- Mother Mary, I haven't much
to say except I love them all.

445
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:28,110
Even if they don't understand
me.

446
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,528
Am I ill?

447
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,074
They insist I am but won't you
tell me?

448
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:38,368
It's normal for a girl
to feel sad sometimes.

449
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,873
It's hard to fathom the
complexity of God's love.

450
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:43,166
Help us.

451
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,597
- So what kind of herbal
remedies are we concocting
today?

452
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,519
- A little clover blossom
for the infusions.

453
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:07,355
- Hg?

454
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,568
I thought you used only
natural ingredients.

455
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,780
- Don't question my methods.

456
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,503
- What are you doing?

457
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,296
Why did she do it, Peg?

458
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,256
- Stop!
- Why did she do it?

459
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,257
- You're gonna wreck it all!

460
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:35,926
- They poisoned her, she wasn't
possessed!

461
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:37,844
She wasn't possessed, they
poisoned her!

462
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,096
- Who? Who are you talking
about?

463
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,307
- They poisoned her!

464
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:47,314
Why did she do it?

465
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:48,939
- Jodi!

466
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,256
- Ugh, you guys are the worst!

467
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:27,133
- Eat up, you'll feel better.

468
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:30,887
- No, I don't want any
of your stupid soup.

469
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:36,019
- Either you drink the soup
or put on the nightgown.

470
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,732
- Ugh, fine!

471
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:52,242
- Heal the sick, raise the dead.

472
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,205
Cleanse the lepers, cast out
demons.

473
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:57,706
Voices not your own-

474
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:58,957
- No, no, no, no.

475
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,250
I don't wanna hear this.

476
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,210
I know, sorry, I can't.

477
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:05,423
- Wow, is there anything
you can't make look good?

478
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,925
- As long as you don't ask
for another photo shoot.

479
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,477
- Look, look, I just found this
key!

480
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,981
- Ooh, let me see.

481
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,776
Hmm, I wonder.

482
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,365
- Ugh, it obviously doesn't go
there!

483
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:15,661
- Try the wardrobe.

484
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:46,022
- Can I take the nightgown off?

485
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:49,903
Feeling kind of itchy and
it's your turn to wear it.

486
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:54,617
- April 8th,
1969.

487
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:58,036
I wish I had better news.

488
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:02,916
Ruth's last batch had already
seemed to sour in the sun.

489
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,251
Nevertheless, she injected the
cat

490
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,794
with the potential remedy.

491
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,257
I'm grateful Ruth's findings are
complete

492
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,469
and have been submitted
to medical journals.

493
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:17,513
But I fear the entire scientific
community

494
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,432
making sport of her research.

495
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:23,935
She initially tried to create an
antidote

496
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,354
for early onset dementia

497
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,315
but when my daughter became
sullen and melancholy,

498
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:33,779
Ruth fed the formula and
her condition only worsened

499
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:37,198
and we all had to bear the
darkness,

500
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,827
the delirium of unbearable
deterioration

501
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,954
and impending death.

502
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:46,457
She concocted a tincture
of niacin and rabies

503
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,752
taken straight from one
of the mangy coyotes

504
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,255
my groundsman brought in.

505
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:56,426
I now admit experimenting on
the poor creature was cruel,

506
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:59,222
for it truly altered her
offspring for the worst.

507
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,798
- Well, now we know we have
access

508
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,218
to the seventh gate of Hell.

509
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,220
- How can you girls

510
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:24,600
be doing your makeup at a time
like this?

511
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,900
There's someone in the driveway.

512
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,109
- Hide!

513
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:51,457
- Father, what you's doing here?

514
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:52,876
I wasn't expecting you.

515
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:54,711
- I need solitude, Nestor.

516
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:57,589
- Wait, you's got
something you needs to know

517
00:45:57,591 --> 00:45:59,716
before you ventures inside.

518
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:00,842
- What is it?

519
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:03,386
- Bad, bad infestation.

520
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:04,930
- What kind of infestation?

521
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,890
- You don't wants to know.

522
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:08,308
- Step aside, Nestor.

523
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:10,979
Let me through.

524
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,801
Who in the hell is in my house?

525
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,559
I'm a priest.

526
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,938
A prophet, a servant of the most
high God.

527
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:58,108
And you have defiled his house!

528
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:14,835
Mary.

529
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,254
- I've missed you, Father.

530
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:19,882
- You're not my daughter.

531
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:25,594
My daughter was pure
and innocent and sweet!

532
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:26,469
You're nothing like her.

533
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,179
You're an illusion.

534
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:29,683
You're a satanic illusion.

535
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:34,104
- Just what I've always wanted,
a surprise birthday party.

536
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:37,731
Can my friends stay for dinner?

537
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:40,025
- What friends?

538
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:04,925
- Fake priest!

539
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,385
- What kind of hell has been
unleashed in this house?

540
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:08,428
- Unholy father!

541
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,930
- Be gone, false spirit!

542
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:10,889
Henceforth and forever

543
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,849
you and all your demons!
- Don't embarrass God.

544
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:14,309
- All allegiance begone
with your father, the Devil!

545
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:15,435
The father of lies!

546
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:16,728
- You belong in hell with me!

547
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,188
- Fallen angel be gone with you

548
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,148
in the name of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ!

549
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,442
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

550
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,194
- All your life's work has been
in vain!

551
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,403
- You have no power over me!

552
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,322
- Even angels mock your name.

553
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:28,740
- Be gone, foul spirit!

554
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:30,033
Be gone unclean spirit

555
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:32,285
and all your legions, all your
devils

556
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:34,370
and join your father the devil
Satan!

557
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:35,496
- You're pathetic.

558
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:36,998
- I'm filled with God in my
life.

559
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,959
- Soon you'll be sucking my
horns in Hell!

560
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,418
- You are not welcome in this
house,

561
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,128
you and all unclean spirits,

562
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,254
go back to your bowels of
wretchedness!

563
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:44,255
- Never!

564
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:45,298
- Go back to your holy Hell!

565
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,300
Go back to your bowels of
excrement!

566
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,343
- Why is your dick getting hard?

567
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:49,177
- Be gone with thee!

568
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,846
- I know you wanna fuck me like
Mary!

569
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:53,348
- I cast you out in the name
of my Lord's name Jesus Christ!

570
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,310
His power in his name, he
treads you under his hell!

571
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:29,425
A priest's role is to
offer a sacrifice unto God.

572
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:30,804
That's his true calling.

573
00:49:33,265 --> 00:49:35,934
Oh, Lord.

574
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:38,186
Lord, most high.

575
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,396
Just as in the old covenant

576
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:44,733
when the blood of animals
was offered as a sacrifice

577
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:49,740
and the high priest offered
gifts and sacrifices for sins.

578
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:56,539
I humbly offer my life, my
offering.

579
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,124
I sacrifice unto thee.

580
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,054
- We gotta get outta here!

581
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:53,051
- Yeah, let's see.

582
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,387
These things in.

583
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:03,396
Ha, I won't be needing
that anymore.

584
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:06,857
Look at that.

585
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:11,113
Never again will I toil in
the hot sun like a mule.

586
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,451
- Nestor, what are you doing?

587
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:21,412
You can't just leave us with
that thing!

588
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:22,583
- Take us with you.

589
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,544
- I'll make a deals with you.

590
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:28,672
Y'all's idolatries aren't my
problem.

591
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:33,049
I ain't gonna answer to my
master no more.

592
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:37,220
Now you gonna gimme half
that cash I know you stole.

593
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,807
I seen yous through the window.

594
00:51:39,642 --> 00:51:42,559
Then I'm off to Tijuana.

595
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:45,147
My chamber pot days is over.

596
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:49,566
- Fine, you can have it as
long as we can hitch a ride.

597
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:50,817
You can drop us off

598
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,612
somewhere along the way near Los
Angeles.

599
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:56,281
I'm supposed to be a model, you
see, so.

600
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:05,957
Just heat lightning,
but supposing I'm wrong.

601
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,959
We'd best be getting along.

602
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:11,004
Roads flood fast when the rains
come.

603
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,633
Best get ready 'cause if
you ain't all saddled up

604
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:17,971
in 15 minutes, I'm leaving yous
behind.

605
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:20,471
- All right, get ready.

606
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:21,559
I'll get Jodi.

607
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:32,444
Get outta the shower, Jodi,
we're leaving!

608
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:23,952
- Were you also homeschooled by
the Devil?

609
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:26,496
- No, I wasn't.

610
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:28,542
- Please, will you help me take
this off?

611
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,630
- Of course I will.

612
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,424
- We'll devour your organs in
Hell!

613
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:39,843
- No!

614
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,845
- Put me out of my misery.

615
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:44,600
- No, no!

616
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:16,212
- All right.

617
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:17,631
What am I missing?

618
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:22,220
Got my smokes, venison
jerky, black licorice.

619
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:31,689
Mary Joseph, don't take me now!

620
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,151
You're not real!

621
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,238
You died a long time ago!

622
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:18,986
- Jodi?

623
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:49,180
- What are we gonna do now?

624
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:51,852
- Find his keys, we're
driving out of here ourselves!

625
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:01,069
Oh, that is it!

626
00:56:16,209 --> 00:56:18,001
I am ending this myself!

627
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:22,964
- It's not starting!

628
00:57:18,063 --> 00:57:20,065
- Can you see me?

629
00:57:29,742 --> 00:57:31,076
Can you find me?

630
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:57,705
- Lori?

631
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:00,207
Lori?

632
00:59:56,764 --> 00:59:59,347
- Life is not supposed to be
good.

633
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:00,726
That's all there is to know.

634
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,393
Why don't you put the kettle on?

635
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,898
Some dandelion tea sounds nice
about now.

636
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:09,527
What's that you have there?

637
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:12,193
- It's, it's nothing!

638
01:00:12,195 --> 01:00:13,319
It's nothing.

639
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:14,156
- Let me see.

640
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:18,243
You'll be punished if you
disobey me!

641
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:21,163
Punished like Mary was.

642
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:44,812
- Hello, Lori?

643
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:47,813
The door is locked!

644
01:01:40,283 --> 01:01:42,158
- Won't you play jacks with me?

645
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,120
- Now's not a good time.

646
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:47,539
- I'm Mary's unborn brother.

647
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:51,167
She put me in the outhouse
when I was just a fetus.

648
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:52,794
All the way down.

649
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,796
Mother made her do it.

650
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,174
Do they not love me?

651
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:00,010
- That's a really sad story.

652
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:01,928
What's your name, little boy?

653
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,555
- I'm Aberdeen.

654
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:06,307
It must be nice to have a toilet
now.

655
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:08,268
You should hide in the closet

656
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,436
and don't come out until
morning.

657
01:02:10,438 --> 01:02:13,023
That's when she goes away.

658
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,733
Are you my mommy?

659
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:17,528
- No, I'm not related to you.

660
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,320
But I wish I was.

661
01:02:19,322 --> 01:02:22,741
Why can't all of the
spirits be nice like you?

662
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:25,579
- I like Heaven, but
I wanna come back now.

663
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:37,589
- Mother Mary, please,

664
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:42,596
wash away my sins so
that if I die tonight,

665
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:47,893
I will bask in his eternal glory
forever.

666
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:50,979
Cleanse me.

667
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,856
Cleanse me of,

668
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:57,986
of my indecencies and
and my naughty thoughts.

669
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,364
I didn't wanna be in Hustlers.

670
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:05,160
Not, not really.

671
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:29,977
I'm ridding myself of this.

672
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,396
Cheesecake photography.

673
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:38,775
I'm ashamed.

674
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,278
I'd hate for my mother to see.

675
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,664
You see?

676
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:53,500
You see?

677
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:58,587
Is that what you want from me?

678
01:03:58,589 --> 01:03:59,422
Is it?

679
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:50,052
- Join us.

680
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:58,143
- No!

681
01:07:01,229 --> 01:07:02,064
- Join us!

682
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:21,499
Join us!

683
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:30,924
- The power of Christ impales
you!

684
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:22,601
Hail Mary, full of grace.

685
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:24,185
The Lord is with thee.

686
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,229
Blessed art thou among women

687
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:29,190
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb Jesus.

688
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:31,192
Holy Mary, mother of God,

689
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:34,655
pray for us sinners from now
until the hour of our deaths.

690
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:35,490
Amen.

691
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:38,992
Hail Mary, full of grace.

692
01:08:38,994 --> 01:08:40,869
The Lord is with thee.

693
01:08:40,871 --> 01:08:42,538
Blessed art thou among women

694
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:45,206
and blesses the fruit of thy
womb Jesus.

695
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,417
Holy Mary, mother of God.

696
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:51,171
Pray for us sinners from now
until the hour of our death.

697
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:53,423
Amen.

698
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:31,587
- Peg, Peg!

699
01:09:31,589 --> 01:09:35,632
You've done it again, you
wretched child.

700
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:40,639
Penance, penance will consume
the rest of your days.

701
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:43,724
You can forget about breakfast.

702
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:46,810
How dreadful of you to toil away

703
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:50,897
the morning hours in this
selfish fashion.

704
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:54,860
Are you studying to become
a nun or aren't you?

705
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:57,571
Rise from your sinful slumber.

706
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:00,031
- Mother Superior, please.

707
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:02,242
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see you!

708
01:10:02,244 --> 01:10:04,870
I was trapped in the most horrid
dream.

709
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:06,454
- I know.

710
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:09,292
And it's time for you to go back
now!

711
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:54,795
- Who are you and why
are you wearing that?

712
01:10:54,797 --> 01:10:57,380
- I'm Bonnie and I just
found this under the rubble.
