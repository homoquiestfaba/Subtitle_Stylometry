00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,630
[Steven narrating]
Steve Rawlins.

3
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,714
A filmmaker.

4
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,633
Up close and personal.

5
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,802
I'm making a film about sex.

6
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,720
Love and commitment.

7
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,015
An exploration into myself
and the people I know.

8
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,184
Everyone has an opinion,

9
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,811
but is there an answer?

10
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,813
I remember it was [stuttering]

11
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,147
it was the side of a hill.

12
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,442
We made love
on the side of a hill.

13
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,655
And I kept thinking
that Chinese proverb, you know,

14
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,616
those who fuck on
the side of the hill...

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,742
[chuckles]

16
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,786
[man]
Have you ever had, um...

17
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,496
a mÃ©nage Ã  trois?

18
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,747
Sure.

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,292
Hey, I lived in the 70s.
[chuckles]

20
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,461
[Kathleen] I've done...
basically everything.

21
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,548
They haven't turned
out very well though.

22
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,009
[Steven]
Through these interviews

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,343
and my own relationships,

24
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,846
I'm exploring
this thing we called "love".

25
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,306
It's weird.

26
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,807
[Steven] Hi.

27
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,601
[woman]
Hi. The casting director?

28
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,685
[Steven] No, the director.

29
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,688
[woman] Oh. Well I guess
I'm talking to the right person.

30
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,107
So, do you know
what this is about?

31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,193
Uh, no not really.

32
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,069
Well, it's
a strong narrative film

33
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,654
with interviews cut within it.

34
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,865
Okay.

35
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,284
It's a story
about a relationship,

36
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,619
the beginning, middle, and end.

37
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,454
Cut within that, we see

38
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,040
real life people going through
what they go through in life.

39
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,375
That sounds really neat.

40
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,377
Yeah, it's sorta like
we're looking for insight

41
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,879
into relationships

42
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,048
and we see it through them and
the people being interviewed.

43
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,132
Okay.

44
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,842
[Steven] So do you have
any questions about the sides?

45
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,219
Um... no.

46
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,387
[Steven] Well, um,

47
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,765
then you can start at anytime.

48
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,058
So, go ahead.

49
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,184
Okay.

50
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,356
[sighs] You know, okay!

51
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,233
You know, I got a little tense.

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,445
[woman] God! Hello?

53
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,240
[frustratedly]
Are you just gonna sit there?

54
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,203
Now, I know you wanted me
to read your sides, but...

55
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,747
I brought my own.

56
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,085
I hope you like it.

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,921
[clears throat]

58
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,590
I need you.

59
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,843
I want you.

60
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,263
I love you.

61
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,765
Good, huh?

62
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,727
[talking with mouthful]
Shit, I had this!

63
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,647
[mimicking guitar noises]

64
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,066
[off-pitch noise]

65
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,280
[Steven] Well,
it can only get worse.

66
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,948
No.

67
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,576
It can only get better.
A lot better.

68
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,618
[sexy jazz music]

69
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,371
[Steven] I think
the love exploration's begun.

70
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,458
Hi.

71
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,085
-[blonde woman] Hi.
-Hi.

72
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,461
How are you?

73
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,463
Fine.

74
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,133
So, do you have
any questions about the sides?

75
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,227
[woman on televison] I know that
the male is very easily deceived

76
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,190
by thinking that sex is love.

77
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,816
Because in half of my--

78
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,943
[blonde woman] I'm sick
of this silent treatment shit.

79
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,403
This isn't working out.

80
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,865
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

81
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,618
[Steven chuckles]

82
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,328
[abashedly] Sorry.

83
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:05,913
Wow...

84
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,497
Kinda convincing, huh?

85
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,250
I'm-- yeah. It was good.

86
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,085
Do you wanna see something more?

87
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,546
Well, how many more do we have?

88
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,382
[woman]
She's the last one today.

89
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,759
Oh, okay.

90
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,012
Well, we're starving, so we're
gonna go to the pizza place.

91
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,805
Can we get you anything?

92
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,432
[Steven] Um, I'm okay.

93
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,316
So, is that it?

94
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,693
Oh, I'm sorry. So...

95
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,904
Tell me something about you.

96
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,532
-What do you mean?
-Sit down, sit down.

97
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,495
You're very attractive.

98
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,372
Thank you.

99
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,791
So, um...

100
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,085
You wanna be an actress, huh?

101
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,419
I am an actress.

102
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,004
I'm sorry, that was stupid.

103
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,965
You already have this role cast?

104
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,216
No, no, no.

105
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,718
No, no,
they were just were starving

106
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,178
and we've been here all day.

107
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,639
Actually,
I'd love for you to do it again.

108
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,933
[blonde woman] Alright, um,
do you want something different?

109
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,561
Yeah tell--
what does she want?

110
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,855
What do I want?
Or what does the character want?

111
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,024
Well she wants, uh...

112
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,861
She wants him
to say something, right?

113
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,905
Well, I don't have an answer.
I'm just, you know, curious.

114
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,201
Oh, okay, well,
she wants a reaction from him.

115
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,411
[Steven] Okay.

116
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,456
She wants him to plea.

117
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,751
To, uh, crawl.

118
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,755
To... beg for her love.

119
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:39,882
[Steven chuckles]

120
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,343
Okay. Whatever works for you.

121
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,137
-Okay.
-Can I stand up?

122
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,763
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

123
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,934
[clears throat]

124
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,691
Look, I've really been tense
these past couple days, and...

125
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,280
Look, I am sick,
of this silent treatment!

126
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,740
[Steven] Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

127
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,326
[Steven] Visualize me
like you would your husband.

128
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,871
-Oh, I'm not married.
-Oh, I saw the ring...

129
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,998
Yeah, well it's on this finger.

130
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,125
Well, okay,
so I'm your boyfriend.

131
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,294
[Steven] You've been
in this situation, right?

132
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,004
Too many times.

133
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,881
[Steven] Really? That bad, huh?
[laughs]

134
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,591
-Well...
-Yeah, that's okay.

135
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,675
[Steven] Tell me. I'm curious.

136
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,928
No...

137
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,932
[Steven] No, come on. Come on.

138
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,268
You're very beautiful.

139
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,811
Really?

140
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,689
[woman] You guys are still here?

141
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,986
[Steven] I, um...

142
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,322
She's reading, yeah.
She's reading.

143
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,909
Oh. Well, it's closed,
so we were gonna go to Vivian's.

144
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,536
We were wondering
if you wanted to come.

145
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,413
-Um, yeah sure.
-Of course,

146
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,998
when she's done reading.

147
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,710
Yeah. So, um, try it again.
Try it one more time.

148
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,172
[Steven] Okay?

149
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,550
Alright.

150
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,013
[sighs]

151
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,557
So, are you tired?

152
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,184
-No, I'm okay.
-So come with us!

153
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,186
I dunno...

154
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,857
So, um, who did you like?
[laughs]

155
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,109
There were a couple good ones.
A couple crazies.

156
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,028
I thought you were gonna
jump down the last one's pants.

157
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,282
[laughs] I thought you were
gonna crawl over the table!

158
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,867
You guys are
just giving me shit, man.

159
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,828
We're not giving you shit!
[laughs] It happens to be true!

160
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,457
Yeah, I mean. She was okay,
you know, if you like that type.

161
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,168
Yeah, she was okay.

162
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,378
[giggling]

163
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,635
[jazzy clarinet music]

164
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,038
[phone ringing]

165
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,081
Hello?

166
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,586
-Hello?
-Shannon.

167
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,254
-Yeah?
-Yeah, hi.

168
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,173
This is Steven Rawlins.

169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,341
You read for me.

170
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,884
Oh yeah. Hi.

171
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,554
Yeah, um,
I was just wondering if you...

172
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,348
Well, this isn't
exactly a callback.

173
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,475
I was wondering if you wanted
to have lunch or something.

174
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,102
Um...

175
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,230
Can you hold on a second?

176
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,065
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

177
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,283
This is kinda out-of-the-blue.
This isn't about the film?

178
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,119
Not exactly...

179
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,956
You know, I was just
thinking about you a lot.

180
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,876
Well, um, I'm kinda involved
with somebody right now.

181
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,504
-Oh, okay.
-If you know what I mean.

182
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,924
Yeah, no, no. Okay.
I'm sorry. No, no problem.

183
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:09,967
[phone clicks]

184
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,969
What a weirdo.

185
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,930
[under breath]
God, what a weirdo.

186
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,057
[phone rings]

187
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,562
Yeah, I know
this is sorta strange--

188
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,815
I didn't even ask if
you were involved or anything.

189
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,859
-I guess that was kinda rude.
-Nah, it's okay.

190
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,070
-I feel really stupid.
-Really, it's okay.

191
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,364
[Steven] I'm really
just sort of embarrassed.

192
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,575
[laughs]
It's okay. I understand.

193
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,035
I know you think I do this
all the time or something.

194
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,704
It really doesn't matter.

195
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,833
Well, you know, I don't. I just
thought you were sort of...

196
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,835
sort of sexy, and...

197
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,795
Well, I mean,
you know, it was sweet.

198
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:47,963
Yeah?

199
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,174
Well, yeah...

200
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,801
Well, I'd still
like to do something.

201
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,513
Well, um, maybe
we all could do something.

202
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,390
[Steven] Me, you,
and your boyfriend?

203
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,019
Yeah.
Well...no...um...

204
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,980
Just me and you, as friends?

205
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,734
[Steven] Oh, yeah.
Okay... [stammers]

206
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,944
Well there's
this party Wednesday--

207
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,113
Oh, no.
I'm working on Wednesday.

208
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,908
-Well, Thursday. There's--
We could [stammers]

209
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,576
No pressure.

210
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,788
-Okay, okay. Thursday's alright.
-[Steven] Okay. Friends.

211
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,876
-Yeah, no pressure. Bye.
-[Steven] See ya later.

212
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,839
[exclaims frustratedly]

213
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,424
[jazzy clarinet music]

214
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,802
I feel really...

215
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,223
good about myself,
in a very calm way.

216
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,643
[woman on television]
I feel completely like myself.

217
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,062
I don't have
to be anybody different.

218
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,480
I feel very accepted.

219
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,399
I feel very accepting
of the other person.

220
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,902
[upbeat saxophone music]

221
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,364
Wow.

222
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,368
[Steven] Yeah, you know.

223
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,537
Who says directors
make a lot of money-- I don't.

224
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,413
It's just a little place, home.

225
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,499
-It's great.
-Can I get you anything?

226
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,126
Yeah. You said you were
gonna give me that script.

227
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,336
Oh yeah...

228
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,923
-There's one right there.
-Great.

229
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,383
[Steven] I'll get you something,
hang on.

230
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,397
[whistles lowly]

231
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,902
What's this?

232
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,821
It's just a little wine.

233
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,614
It's a little early,
don't you think?

234
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,117
Alright, fine. You don't want
my wine. [chuckles]

235
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,552
I think...maybe I should go.

236
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,888
[Steven] Oh, no. Come on.
We just got here. Sit down.

237
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,639
I got you some soda here.

238
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,517
So, um-- I know!

239
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,852
Tell me [stammers]

240
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,978
Oh! Tell me
something embarrassing

241
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,062
that happened to you.

242
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,316
-Something embarrassing?
-[Steven] Yeah, yeah.

243
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,151
Why?

244
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,361
Just for me, just for me.

245
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,405
Alright, uh...

246
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,034
You go first.

247
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,286
Okay, okay. I'll tell you.

248
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,412
[exclaims]

249
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,582
So, I was--
I had an old girlfriend, right?

250
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,585
And so we're in this park,
and she [stammers]

251
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,588
was complaining all day
about this groin rash she had,

252
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,674
and so she said,
"Can you check on it for me?"

253
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,384
So, we're in this park,
it's all public,

254
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,469
and she lifts her dress,

255
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:41,929
and I'm checking
on her groin rash,

256
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,555
and these people
come around the corner...

257
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,849
Very embarrassing.
Yeah, they thought

258
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,226
I was totally going down on her.

259
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,352
I wasn't.

260
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,688
A rash?

261
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,567
Okay, so. You had to be

262
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,902
Okay. Your turn.

263
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,697
[Shannon] Well...
Something embarrassing...

264
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,658
Um...

265
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,536
Alright.

266
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,412
I was in this high school play,

267
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,374
and we had all
these costume changes to do,

268
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,961
and so, I had taken off
this one costume,

269
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,170
I put on this other one,

270
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,255
and it was like, woolly.

271
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,215
Right before I was
supposed to get on stage,

272
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,635
I was leaning back
in this chair, and I went on,

273
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,721
and my bra got stuck
on the back of my sweater,

274
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,890
and I was swinging around
doing the performance like this,

275
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,517
and the bra was flying around,

276
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,561
and nobody told me
that the bra was on my back,

277
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,396
until the very end of the play.

278
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,981
[chuckles]

279
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,607
[Steven] That's great.

280
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,237
Oh? Yeah. Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's embarrassing.

281
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,780
I thought it was embarrassing.

282
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,282
[Steven] Yeah.

283
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,368
So, tell me. Why did you think
that I already had this cast?

284
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,123
Oh, well. I just didn't
think you were interested.

285
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,834
That's not true.
I'm very interested, really.

286
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,419
Really interested.

287
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,629
Oh, well,
[chuckles uncomfortably]

288
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:03,635
-Well, thanks for lunch.
-Okay. Let me walk you out.

289
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,180
-Bye.
-Yeah.

290
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,600
So yeah, look over the script
and tell me what you think.

291
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,643
-Alright.
-And we'll go from there.

292
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,478
Alright, well thanks for
coming over and everything.

293
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,230
[both laughing awkwardly]

294
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,357
[chuckles] Sorry.

295
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,318
I'm such a klutz, I'm sorry.

296
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,777
[chuckles] Okay. Sorry.

297
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,627
No, wait.

298
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,921
Yeah, I'm sorry. God.

299
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,964
I should go.
[Steven sighs]

300
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,591
Yeah. You should go.

301
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,469
-Alright. It's been real.
-Thanks.

302
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,097
You're really, very nice.

303
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,099
Thanks. You too.

304
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,522

Wait!

309
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,453
-[laughs] Wait!
-[Steven] What?

310
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,457
-[Steven] What? Come on.
-[Shannon] It's dripping.

311
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,002
[Steven] Yeah, yeah.
Hey, I can clean it up later.

312
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,463
[Shannon] No, no, no--
You should probably do it now.

313
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,340
Just get me something--
It's gonna stain.

314
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,383
[Steven] Yeah.

315
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,718
[clears throat]

316
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,428
-[Steven] Yeah, here.
-[Shannon] Thanks.

317
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,430
You know, I was just thinking

318
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,933
that maybe
we should slow down a little.

319
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,561
Or, a lot.

320
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,812
Completely.

321
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,607
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry. I got--

322
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,276
I'm just, very attracted to you.

323
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,654
-Really?
-Yeah, um. I sorta lost control.

324
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,155
Yeah. Me too.

325
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,032
So, can we get together again?

326
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,410
Well, no.

327
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,329
-Oh, I forgot. I forgot about...
-Sure, that's alright.

328
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,956
No, I liked that. Really.

329
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,375
Well, I did too.

330
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,878
So, do you still have
the same number?

331
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,381
No, actually. I'm gonna go
and change it. [both chuckle]

332
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,841
I'm just kidding.

333
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,302
Why don't-- I'll call you.

334
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,888
-Oh okay.
-But I need your number.

335
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,265
Oh. Yeah, okay. Let me get it.

-Wait. Wait, wait.
-[Steven] What?

351
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,694
-I can't do this.
-[Steven] Can't do what?

00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,218
[laughs and exclaims]

357
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,802
[sighs]

358
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,019
We were engaged to be married,

359
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:08,357
and two week later,
I found him in bed with...

360
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:11,485
two other girls, and...

361
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,904
-[Steven] Two other girls?
-Two other girls.

362
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,907
It was an unexpected
[unintelligible] that I took.

363
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:21,370
I flew down to where
he was at with the band, and,

364
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:26,500
found him in bed
with these two girls,

365
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,461
threw the keys to the one girl,

366
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,173
and the ring to the other,
then I said,

367
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,926
"There, you got your wife
and your mistress now",

368
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,594
and walked out.

369
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,762
[jazzy clarinet music]

370
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,764
[Steven dictating] Everything
was going beautifully.

371
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,182
[typing noises]
They were both tremendously

372
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,433
horny for each other.

373
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,935
Then, for no apparent reason,

374
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,979
she just leaves him,
completely frustrated.

375
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,440
He quickly grabs her
and stops her from leaving.

376
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,901
He looks into her eyes.
She melts.

377
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,946
And they do it right there
in his open doorway.

378
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,323
[frustrated typing]

379
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,575
[phone ringing]

380
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,203
-Hello.
-[Shannon] Hey.

381
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,580
Who is this?
[typing loudly]

382
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,664
[Shannon] I'm sorry.

383
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,332
[Steven chuckles sarcastically]

384
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,836
Yeah. You forgot something.

385
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,920
[sniffs deeply]

386
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,214
[Shannon] I need
to explain some things.

387
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,216
-[Steven] Yeah?
-[Shannon] Can I come over?

388
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:17,926
Can you come over?

389
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,471
-Sure, you can come over.
-[Shannon] Alright.

390
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,098
Okay.

391
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,645
Hm.

392
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,232
[typing loudly]
She comes over.

393
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,285
[funky jazz music]

394
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,490
[tango music]

395
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,590
[Steven] Oh.

396
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,800
[sobbing loudly]

397
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,426
[Steven] Hey, are you alright?

398
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:42,678
[Steven] Come in.
[sobbing continues]

399
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,096
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,432
Come on, come in.
Sit down, sit down.

401
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:49,685
[wailing]

402
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,020
No, come on. God...

403
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,523
[Shannon] I really need
to talk to someone.

404
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,900
[Steven] What' the problem?
Just a second.

405
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:57,985
[music stops]

406
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,236
[Steven] So, are you alright?

407
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,446
[wailing] No, yeah, I'm fine.

408
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,699
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-No!

409
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,534
Oh, so it's
something about him, huh?

410
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,577
Yeah.

411
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,705
-Yeah, guys can be such fools.
-Yeah.

412
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,416
[Steven] Just float off!
[sniffling loudly]

413
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,042
I look like a mess!

414
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,461
No, no, no.
Come on, you're fine.

415
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:17,838
You don't know!

416
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,840
What's to know? What's to know?

417
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,758
[high-pitched wailing]

418
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:25,888
What are you looking for?

419
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,514
Rotting.

420
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:28,807
Oh no, yeah.
I got him. It's human.

421
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,809
I'm stupid.

422
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,395
Yeah, well, it's foolish.
So, um...

423
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,147
Did he find out about us?

424
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:38,775
No. [sniffles]
We've been on the outs forever.

425
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,444
-Really?
-Yeah.

426
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:43,113
We haven't
had sex in 8 months, and,

427
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,282
that's why
I went so crazy today.

428
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,451
Yeah, we got kinda crazy, huh?

429
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,119
Yeah.

430
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,706
-Did I mess you up?
-No, I'm-- I was cool.

431
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:54,958
[Shannon] You're nice.

432
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,467
[kissing noises]

433
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:04,843
[moaning and panting]

434
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,305
-[Steven] Wait, wait, wait!
-[Shannon] What?

435
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:13,101
-What?
-Come here. [chuckles]

436
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,479
[slow romantic music]

437
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:23,695
âª You make me see
All the ways I've been hiding âª

438
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,698
[Steven] [sighs] There's
a million reasons to avoid her.

439
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,618
She's flaky, she's obnoxious,
she's an actress.

440
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,120
But she's got a great butt.

441
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,122
She smells fine.

442
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,459
She has that soft,
smooth, shapely skin.

443
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:41,004
Yes, there is a God.

444
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:48,762
âª Now make me know
Where I belong âª

445
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:53,225
âª Take me for your love r âª

446
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,431
[door creaking]

447
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,620
[Shannon] I had to pee-pee.

448
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,041
[upbeat jazzy music]

449
00:24:29,297 --> 00:24:30,882
-Hey.
-Hi.

450
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,927
I have an audition.
You sleep late.

451
00:24:37,138 --> 00:24:38,640
I'll be back later, alright.

452
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:40,308
Bye.

453
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:43,895
Bye, honey.

454
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,876
[solemn saxophone music]

455
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,712
[Steven dictating] He naively
fell into her little game,

456
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:12,882
She stayed the night
and ruined his life.

457
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:16,219
Once they got down,
he could never get out.

458
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:18,846
It was a relationship thriller.

459
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:21,432
She was a Venus snatch-trap.

460
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:23,142
Hi.

461
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:26,271
[chuckles] Yeah, hi.
How ya doing?

462
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,522
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

463
00:25:27,564 --> 00:25:28,606
Yeah, I'm here.

464
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:31,943
-Is everything alright?
-Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

465
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:37,532
-You make me so happy.
-Oh, really?

466
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:39,868
You're so cute,
I just wanna eat you up!

467
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,662
Yeah, well. Man, you move fast.

468
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:47,584
Yeah, I do, don't I?

469
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:51,671
So, does that
always work for you?

470
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:54,883
No. I don't know.

471
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,969
[sighs] We need to talk.

472
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,388
Can it wait, please?

473
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:04,225
[Shannon] I just have some
things I need to work out.

474
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,560
Yeah...

475
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:08,021
I know I'm probably messing
you up and everything, right?

476
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:10,064
No, I'm fine. Really.

477
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,067
[Shannon] I...

478
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:17,155
I really care for you.

479
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:19,532
Already?

480
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:22,660
-I knew right away.
-[Steven] Really?

481
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:24,746
Yeah. How about you?

482
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,125
I just need a little time,
you know. I'm just...

483
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:32,712
-I understand.
-How did you audition go?

484
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:34,756
Oh, it was fine.

485
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:38,134
How is your film going?

486
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:41,721
It's fine.
I'm changing a few things.

487
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:44,224
Oh, so, you wrote it too, huh?

488
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:48,311
Yeah, I do everything.
You know, whatever it takes.

489
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:51,564
Well, I'm sorry if I left the
bathroom a mess this morning.

490
00:26:51,606 --> 00:26:53,066
No, no that's fine.

491
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:54,525
So what happened?
You got thrown out?

492
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:57,862
Well, no. I--
[knocking]

493
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:02,617
[Christine] Hi. You ready?

494
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:05,954
[Steven] For what?

495
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:10,708
-Oh, what? You forgot?
-Yeah, you remember Christine--

496
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:12,961
-Shannon.
-Hi.

497
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,837
Can I get you anything?

498
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,131
[Steven] You want something?

499
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,676
-No.
-[Steven] She was just reading.

500
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,179
Oh, well,
maybe I should go then.

501
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:24,722
[Steven] No,
you don't have to go.

502
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:27,767
Well, we can do this
another time, really.

503
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:29,185
[Christine] Bye Rawlins.

504
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:33,147
[Steven] Christine.

505
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,651
Look, I can't
work for you anymore.

506
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:38,194
Please.

507
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:44,325
[Christine] I understand.
But I get attached, okay?

508
00:27:44,826 --> 00:27:46,494
So I'll talk to you
sometime later.

509
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:58,006
[sentimental synth music]

510
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:05,930
I can leave if you want.

511
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:08,224
No, it's okay.
She's just a friend.

512
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:12,270
Well, okay. She has a little bit
more stick than I do.

513
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:14,105
Sexually?

514
00:28:14,814 --> 00:28:17,442
-Well--
-That's alright. I understand.

515
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,403
-I should get going anyways.
-No, listen, you know...

516
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,364
So how exactly does she fit in?

517
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:24,908
Well...

518
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:27,535
We were both lonely
at the same time,

519
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:30,747
and it was sort of
a convenient rebound thing.

520
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:32,540
Not so convenient anymore?

521
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,292
No.

522
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:38,296
So, how many
friends do you have?

523
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:39,756
[chuckles]

524
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:42,508
-Come on, you can tell me.
-A couple, I guess.

525
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:44,260
You ever been married?

526
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:47,096
-Are you okay with this?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

527
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,891
-No, not yet.
-Not yet.

528
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:51,935
Well...

529
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:53,853
What? You have
some commitment thing?

530
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:57,690
-No, I...
-That's alright. It's cool.

531
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,735
I'm cool, we're cool.
The whole situation's cool.

532
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:03,029
I only want you
for sex, anyways.

533
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:05,240
-Great.
-The only thing I'm not really

534
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:08,243
hip to is this harem thing
you have going. [chuckles]

535
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:11,246
Monogomy for me, all the way.

536
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:13,248
-That's fair.
-Alright.

537
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:34,727
[woman on television] Sometimes
their mentality, you know.

538
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:36,437
Their mind takes over.

539
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:41,442
After sex, the mind
takes over for a couple of days.

540
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:43,444
You know,

541
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:46,239
if you can find
a male in that state,

542
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:48,992
you know,
he's worth having dinner with.

543
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,631
You're so beautiful.

544
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:06,759
[chuckles] Really? I've never
had anybody tell me that before.

545
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:11,514
Come on, you're so sweet
and nice and beautiful.

546
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:15,393
I jumped right into
your life and you accepted it.

547
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:17,186
Nice.

548
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,772
I guess I was
sorta looking for it.

549
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:23,109
-Really?
-Well, maybe I needed it.

550
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:26,237
So, what happened exactly?

551
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:28,823
Well...

552
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:31,868
I got in a fight
and it was over.

553
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:33,828
-Really?
-Mhm.

554
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:36,748
So, I'm sort of a rebound thing?

555
00:30:37,957 --> 00:30:39,459
You like that word, don't you?

556
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,211
Well, I guess it's been fun

557
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,672
-What, you throwing me out?
-No, no.

558
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:47,342
Good, cuz I'm broke. [giggles]

559
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:49,385
And I don't have
a place to live.

560
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:52,013
And, I lost my job.

561
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:55,850
Well, so I'm like the
"get back on your feet" fuck.

562
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:01,522
-That was really crude.
-Aw, it's just a joke. Come on.

563
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:04,025
Look, I'm here
because I wanna be here.

564
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:06,027
I could be with
any one of my friends.

565
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,696
I'm joking. It was a joke.

566
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:10,990
It was a joke!
[scoffs]

567
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,911
Shannon!

568
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:16,913
[sighs]

569
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:19,999
Shannon, come on.
Shannon, where ya going?

570
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,501
You think I'm a slut!

571
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,211
Oh, com--
I don't think you're a slut.

572
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:24,879
-Move along.
-Where ya going?

573
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:26,673
Look,
this isn't working, alright.

574
00:31:26,714 --> 00:31:27,715
What?

575
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:30,218
-Shannon!
-Stop grabbing me!

576
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,722
You're my main squeeze,
you're my Fonda-Lina. Come on!

577
00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:36,891
Come on! Come here.

578
00:31:37,058 --> 00:31:38,393
[both giggling] Stop it!

579
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,229
[Shannon] Put me down! Ow!

580
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,313
[Steven making playful noises]

581
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:45,942
Most of my friends are guys,

582
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:48,236
and they're all so nice.

583
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:52,407
But the ones
I got with are jerks.

584
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,410
[Steven]
When did you first have sex?

585
00:31:56,077 --> 00:31:57,996
The first night
I met him. [laughs]

586
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:03,418
It was not supposed to be--
I didn't want [stammers]

587
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,837
I didn't mean to.
It just happened.

588
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:11,134
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

589
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,511
You just don't wanna
play cuz you're losing.

590
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:15,054
-I'm not losing!
-Yes, you are.

591
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:18,016
Clue is stupid
with two people, anyways

592
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,851
Okay, well, listen.
I think it's...

593
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:21,978
Mr. Green...

594
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,771
in the dining room...

595
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:26,733
with the candlestick.

596
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:28,943
Yeah, right.
[knocking]

597
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,278
I'll get it.

598
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:33,740
What? You think it's some
girlfriend, or something?

599
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:34,949
No, no...

600
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,080
[screams]

601
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:43,499
[Steven] Can I help you?

602
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,626
Here's your shit.

603
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:46,294
Good luck, asshole.

604
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:52,133
She forgets to flush.

605
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:54,677
Um, damn.

606
00:32:55,803 --> 00:32:57,805
[Shannon]
Give me just two minutes...

607
00:32:58,473 --> 00:32:59,474
[door slams]

608
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:08,441
-What the hell are you doing?
-What?

609
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,818
-What are you doing here?
-[Daniel] Uh...

610
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:12,695
-You broke up with me.
-[Daniel] So?

611
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,322
So, what the hell
are you doing here?

612
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:15,365
Showing how much I love you!

613
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:16,991
-You don't love me!
-I do, so!

614
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,743
[Shannon] Bullshit, you're
just trying to ruin my life.

615
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:19,827
Let's try again.

616
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,496
You don't want to, remember?

617
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:23,456
-[Daniel] That's not true.
-That's what you said.

618
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:24,958
-I didn't mean it.
-[Shannon] That's what you said.

619
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:26,000
That's not true.

620
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,336
Look, I can't handle
this bullshit anymore, alright?

621
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:30,046
Just get out of my life
and leave me alone.

622
00:33:30,463 --> 00:33:31,464
[sighs] I'm sorry.

623
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:33,758
Why are you always
being such a jerk?

624
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:35,385
You don't love me! So, go!

625
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,515
Yeah, you're right.

626
00:33:41,307 --> 00:33:42,308
See ya.

627
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,601
[slow sinister music]

628
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:45,687
[Steven dictating]
The temptation was too great.

629
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,189
Her little fling has forced him
to show his true love for her.

630
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:51,943
Daniel, what are you doing?
Why are you here?

631
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,070
-I love you.
-I don't hear it.

632
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:55,572
I don't care what you
wanna hear, it's true,

633
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:56,656
I really love you.

634
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:57,824
[Shannon] Why did you
break up with me?

635
00:33:57,865 --> 00:33:59,826
Because I took you for granted
and I can't cope.

636
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:00,869
I'm a stupid idiot.

637
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:03,413
-Is that absolutely true?
-I have to have you.

638
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:04,497
[panting and moaning]

639
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:11,004
Wait.
I love you.

640
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:12,714
I'll see you at home.

641
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:14,632
I'll be there.

642
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:17,385
[both panting heavily]

643
00:34:17,594 --> 00:34:18,595
What are you typing?

644
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:27,896
You're so wonderful.

645
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,440
Really?

646
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:32,734
So, was that the boyfriend?

647
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:34,736
The ex-boyfriend.

648
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:38,281
Oh, he's crazy.
Forget about him.

649
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:40,575
-So, what are you typing?
-Nothing, nothing.

650
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:42,952
I really don't know how
he knew we were here.

651
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,287
I never said anything.

652
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:46,497
So, is my life in danger?

653
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:49,417
Nah, he wouldn't hurt a flea.

654
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,836
He's not like the one
you hear on the news,

655
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,088
who chops up people
and puts them in phone booths?

656
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:55,715
I guess he could be.

657
00:34:57,258 --> 00:34:58,968
-Great...
-I'm just kidding.

658
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:02,263
Besides, I'll protect you.

659
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:04,224
[quietly] Wonderful.

660
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,392
Oh, I get it.

661
00:35:08,937 --> 00:35:10,021
You're jealous.

662
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:13,608
That's alright.
You can tell me. Talk to me.

663
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,112
I'd like to know
what the hell is going on.

664
00:35:19,322 --> 00:35:21,616
-What?
-I wanna know what's going on.

665
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:24,536
Well-- I can leave.

666
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:27,747
No [stammers] we haven't
talked about a lot of things.

667
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,375
Maybe I should go.

668
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,336
No, I just need
to know a few things--

669
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:34,420
Daniel?

670
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:37,173
Well, that...

671
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,175
Yeah, I mean,
I don't know anything about you.

672
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,636
I don't know about your family,
where you're from,

673
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:44,305
your political inclinations,
all I know is that we have...

674
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:46,182
incredible sex.

675
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:48,184
Yeah.

676
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:50,687
Alright.

677
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:54,107
I come from Pennsylvannia.

678
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:57,068
My mother
and father still live there.

679
00:35:57,277 --> 00:36:00,321
I have a brother that's
studying to be a psychologist.

680
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,824
I was born and raised
in a Christian home,

681
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:04,284
and I don't believe in God.

682
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,496
[Steven] What do you mean
you don't believe in God?

683
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:10,623
-[Shannon] I just don't buy it.
-What is there to buy?

684
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:13,668
[Shannon] I just think we're all
kidding ourselves, you know?

685
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:16,588
It's like,
you're born. You live.

686
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:19,674
You propagate the species, you
die and you rot in some hole.

687
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:20,800
Well, what is God then?

688
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:23,678
[Shannon] It's just some
crazy idea that some ego-maniacs

689
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,221
would come up with to satisfy

690
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:27,390
their egos
and get through their day.

691
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:29,976
Oh, so how do you
explain why we're here?

692
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,019
I don't.

693
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:32,770
[Steven] Well, how do you
explain the universe

694
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:34,022
and atoms and all that shit?

695
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:35,815
Science.

696
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:38,484
[Steven] Oh well, fine.
Science to you is God to me.

697
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:40,111
[Shannon]
What is that word, exactly?

698
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:41,321
-God?
-Yeah.

699
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:43,656
[scoffs]
What are you, an atheist?

700
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:47,368
Actually, no. I used to
go to church every single Sunday

701
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:49,204
until I realized
it was just a bunch of crap.

702
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:51,581
I just think
you're extremely shallow.

703
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:53,791
Where do you
get off calling me shallow

704
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,168
because of what I believe?

705
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:57,253
Okay, maybe you're not shallow.
You're just being--

706
00:36:57,337 --> 00:36:58,880
I mean, you have
one bad experience

707
00:36:58,963 --> 00:36:59,964
with organized religion,

708
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:01,716
so now you've lost
all sense of curiosity?

709
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,218
I'm curious.

710
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:04,552
Well, what happens
when you die?

711
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,930
-You rot in some hole.

712
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:08,348
[sarcastically]
Oh, that's very curious.

713
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:10,225
Do you know that for sure?

714
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:11,809
No, but it's
a lot better than some

715
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,603
of those
ego-maniac concocted ideas.

716
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:17,649
Really? Well, did you know
that all matter is energy?

717
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:19,734
So?

718
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:21,444
Well, I mean it's all this...

719
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:24,405
crazy stuff, you know.
It's cosmic stuff.

720
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:27,492
So, what does that mean?

721
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,743
Well, it's all overwhelming

722
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:29,953
and it's stuff
you don't understand,

723
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:32,747
and the stuff you don't
understand, that's God.

724
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:38,878
Oh, alright. So, what you're
trying to say is that because

725
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:42,006
I don't know
how a toaster works, that's God.

726
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:45,593
Well, I mean--

727
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,428
No. I mean it's like--

728
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:49,681
Like infinity.
You try to count to infinity,

729
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:50,807
so you go, one, two, three,

730
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:52,892
and you try and get there,
and you can't get there, and

731
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:54,936
so that's overwhelming,
now that is God.

732
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,732
I can't believe
you called me shallow.

733
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:02,735
Well, I...

734
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:07,532
Okay, you're not looking
at the whole picture.

735
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:09,534
Yeah, sure.

736
00:38:11,286 --> 00:38:12,287
[Steven] Shannon...

737
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,206
[Steven]
Shannon, Shannon. What's up?

738
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:16,958
Look, I just wanna
be alone, alright?

739
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,293
[Steven] What, what?

740
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:19,836
I just wanna be alone.

741
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:20,962
[Steven] What,
you still love him?

742
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:22,255
[scoffs] Oh, please.

743
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:29,137
[slow jazz music]

744
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:57,725
I would never disgrace
myself by taking it all off.

745
00:39:57,934 --> 00:40:00,103
And, I always
gave my one roommate

746
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:02,021
credit for taking it all off.

747
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:04,399
When I first moved
down here, and she said,

748
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,733
"Go ahead. Just try it."

749
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:09,779
And I did, and it didn't
seem any different... at all.

750
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:12,532
...except the God
that is described to them

751
00:40:12,574 --> 00:40:13,866
by a religious group.

752
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,079
And so they're
kinda more like groupies.

753
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:22,166
They all like the God
that is prescribed to them.

754
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,501
[seagulls chirping]

755
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:24,586
[sentimental guitar music]

756
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:28,715
[Shannon] You have to promise me
never to tell me you love me,

757
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,049
unless you really mean it, okay?

758
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:31,759
[Steven] That's fair.

759
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:33,386
[Shannon]
Cuz, we're completely opposite.

760
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:35,972
I fall in love with
every pedestrian I see.

761
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:37,473
[Steven]
So, now I'm just a pedestrian?

762
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:39,934
[Shannon] [chuckles] No.

763
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:42,770
So, who's the biggest
love affair you've ever had?

764
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,273
Um, it was probably Teri,
when I was 12.

765
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:46,357
12?

766
00:40:46,774 --> 00:40:48,484
You're telling me the most
powerful relationship

767
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:50,361
you've ever had was
when you were 12 years old?

768
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,322
You wouldn't even
have had pubic hair.

769
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:55,783
No, I had two,
and I was very proud of it.

770
00:40:55,825 --> 00:40:57,118
[Shannon chuckles]
I had names for them, really.

771
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,787
-And?
-She devastated me.

772
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:00,914
She crushed me.

773
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:02,457
And you're just now recovering?

774
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:05,126
Yeah, well.
I'm still not over her.

775
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:06,628
[chuckles] So, what happened?

776
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:08,379
So, she, um...

777
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:11,090
She used to hide in the closet
with my best friend, and kiss,

778
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:14,302
and then she'd come out
and tell me how stupid I was.

779
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:17,138
Aw, poor little Stevie
with his two pubic hairs!

780
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,431
[laughing] Shut up.

781
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:20,433
[Shannon giggles]
[Steven] So, um...

782
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:22,810
It's just not the same,
I just can't commit now.

783
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:24,479
Oh, are you serious?

784
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:27,023
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I just [stammers]

785
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:28,316
I can't fall in love.

786
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,151
Well,

787
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:31,986
maybe you haven't
found the right woman.

788
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,697
[giggles]
Me and some horny actress?

789
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:36,449
[laughs nervously]

790
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:38,618
[exclaims] Oh! You're history.

791
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:39,702
You're history!

792
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:40,828
It's okay.
You're not an actress!

793
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:41,913
[both laughing]

794
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,462
[lively jazz music]

795
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:39,762
If you fart,
then I am out of here.

796
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:41,222
I wouldn't fart.

797
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,601
[Steven giggles]

798
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:48,563
[Shannon] [exclaims]
You disgusting! [giggles]

799
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:51,274
Well, I mean. I'm just saying,

800
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:54,319
I hate shiny people, I mean,

801
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:56,404
the limousine,
it drives me crazy.

802
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:58,990
I like limos.

803
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:02,535
What?

804
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:04,495
Limos are fun.

805
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:06,915
They have those
tinted glass windows,

806
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:07,999
and they go up and down,

807
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:10,293
and you can't see
what's going on inside.

808
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,756
-Do you like room service too?
-I love it.

809
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:17,592
Oh god.
This is it. The fatal flaw.

810
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:19,052
What?

811
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,763
The one thing that someone says

812
00:43:21,804 --> 00:43:23,681
that ends
the relationship forever.

813
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:25,516
You're serious?

814
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,101
I'm dead serious.

815
00:43:27,185 --> 00:43:29,437
I mean, this goes against
every tenet of my philosophy.

816
00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:31,105
Really?

817
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:33,942
I mean,
you're a materialist flake.

818
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,946
Now who's Mr. Self-Rightous?

819
00:43:38,655 --> 00:43:40,156
Yep. I guess so.

820
00:43:40,406 --> 00:43:41,407
Oh, come on.

821
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:44,494
I mean, how
can any decent person

822
00:43:44,577 --> 00:43:46,663
believe in room service
and limos,

823
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:48,331
when there's
people starving and stuff?

824
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:49,707
I just like them.

825
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:52,835
Okay, fine.

826
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,965
Steven, it's like, some people
like to have good things,

827
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:59,050
and some people don't.
Everybody's different.

828
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:02,637
No, that's fine. I'm tolerant.
I can deal with your problems.

829
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:05,306
Good.

830
00:44:05,765 --> 00:44:07,517
[giggles]
Okay! Okay, okay!

831
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,311
[Shannon] So, have you ever
done it with whipped cream?

832
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:13,231
[Steven] Uh, no.

833
00:44:14,816 --> 00:44:16,025
[Shannon] Neither have I.

834
00:44:16,776 --> 00:44:18,820
Do you spend a lot of time
thinking about this stuff?

835
00:44:20,363 --> 00:44:22,615
Where was the strangest
place you've ever done it?

836
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:24,951
An elevator.

837
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,829
-You've done it in an elevator?
-I'm lying.

838
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:33,126
Let's go over to the stall.

839
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,461
Come on, for me.

840
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:36,629
-[Steven] No!
-Please.

841
00:44:36,671 --> 00:44:38,047
-I know it'd be for you.
-Come on!

842
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:39,173
-[Steven] No, no, no!
-It'll be fun!

843
00:44:39,257 --> 00:44:40,508
[Steven] No, no, no! Come on!

844
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:41,676

[panting and moaning]

847
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:01,362
[giggles] Hi.

848
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:02,697
It's just my brother and I,

849
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,741
he's handicapped
and I'm helping him out.

850
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,703
-Could you shut the door?
-Yeah, sure, sorry.

851
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:12,665

[grunts]

858
00:45:49,077 --> 00:45:52,622
[Steven] Wait. Oh, no.
It's impossible.

859
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,415
No, no! It's inhumane.

860
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:58,920
[Shannon] So what's this?
[exclaims] Oh, hello my friend.

861
00:45:59,087 --> 00:46:00,088
[Steven] Shan, please.

862
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:01,339
[Shannon]
You need a little white hat.

863
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:02,423
[spraying noise]

864
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:03,466
[gasps] How about a tie?

865

[spraying noise continues]

866
00:46:04,717 --> 00:46:06,761
-[Steven] Oh, my god.
-[Shannon exclaims] Tastes good.

867
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:09,806
[Steven] Oh my-- no!
[Shannon continues exclaiming]

868
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,432
-[Shannon] Wait.
-[Steven] Okay-- wait-- no!

869
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,850
[both moaning]

870
00:46:14,435 --> 00:46:16,604
[Steven] Oh,
that feels good. [moans]

871
00:46:17,105 --> 00:46:19,607
[both moaning]

872
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:24,654
Well, I have a mental illness.

873
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:27,407
It's called
schizoaffective disorder.

874
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:31,369
It appeared
in the last 10 years,

875
00:46:31,452 --> 00:46:32,954
I've become psychotic.

876
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:36,541
[Steven]
What does it mean, psychotic?

877
00:46:36,624 --> 00:46:38,251
It means delusional,
you don't...

878
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:43,298
deal with reality
as other people do.

879
00:46:44,132 --> 00:46:47,886
We never fought, that was
the trouble. [laughs loudly]

880
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:53,099
We never fought about anything.

881
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:56,144
See, I thought
marriage was bliss!

882
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:57,312
[laughs]

883
00:46:57,896 --> 00:47:00,106
Evening Magazine walked in

884
00:47:00,315 --> 00:47:04,611
and there's a whole story
on the coffee shop

885
00:47:04,903 --> 00:47:09,574
and mom and dad saw it at
7 o'clock at night. [chuckles]

886
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:11,951
So, things
were a little bit rough.

887
00:47:12,035 --> 00:47:13,661
My father-- I don't tell--

888
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:15,163
My mother doesn't
talk to me no more.

889
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:16,539
My mom disowned me.

890
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:19,542
No one ever talked about it.

891
00:47:21,336 --> 00:47:23,171
And we never knew about it.

892
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,176
But sometimes
somebody got pregnant.

893
00:47:36,184 --> 00:47:37,477
So there's, uh...

894
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:40,647
28, 29,

895
00:47:41,522 --> 00:47:42,982
30...

896
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:46,069
[breathing deeply]

897
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:52,700
I'm just [stammers]
I'm just stressed.

898
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:53,868
I'll be alright.

899
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,002
[groans sadly]

900
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:04,254
Oh no.

901
00:48:08,216 --> 00:48:09,217
[groans]

902
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,222
[Shannon screams] Oh shit!

903
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:18,101
[screaming profanities]
Shit, no!

904
00:48:18,893 --> 00:48:19,894
[Shannon]
Wait, wait, wait.

905
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:21,145
Whatcha doing?

906
00:48:21,938 --> 00:48:24,566
-Why ya going?
-I'm late. I'm late. I'm late!

907
00:48:24,732 --> 00:48:25,733
-No!
-I'm late!

908
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,068
I have a meeting.
[kissy noises]

909
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:29,654
They're waiting.
[both giggling]

910
00:48:29,862 --> 00:48:30,863
[exclaims disappointedly]

911
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,951
Come on.
I gotta go. I'm gone.

912
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,748
[Shannon] So, why did you
bring me up here on the coldest,

913
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,250
cloudiest day of the year?

914
00:48:43,251 --> 00:48:45,587
[Steven] Cuz we could
come up here on any clear day.

915
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,046
You know, this is special.

916
00:48:48,923 --> 00:48:49,924
[Shannon brrrs]

917
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:52,218
Besides,
you're closer this way.

918
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,887
Oh, I get it.

919
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:59,183
If you had a girl,
what would you name her?

920
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:01,352
This is
a trick question, right?

921
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:02,437
No, I'm being serious.

922
00:49:02,478 --> 00:49:04,522
Cuz you're
making me very nervous.

923
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,653
What do you think
of "Gwen" for a girl?

924
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:13,615
-[Steven] Are you hungry?
-You're such a wimp.

925
00:49:14,115 --> 00:49:15,116
[Steven] You're right.

926
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,452
Well, I wouldn't wanna
have kids with you anyways.

927
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:19,120
Really? Why not?

928
00:49:19,662 --> 00:49:21,122
Cuz you're too selfish.

929
00:49:22,415 --> 00:49:23,917
Yeah, I am selfish.

930
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:26,878
You're probably
not faithful either, are you?

931
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:29,505
[breathes deeply]

932
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:32,634
So, you sold used cars,
that's what you used to sell.

933
00:49:32,759 --> 00:49:34,969
-Shut up!
-I like kids.

934
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:37,013
[Steven] Come on, Shannon.

935
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:38,848
[Shannon]
I'm just not being fair.

936
00:49:39,515 --> 00:49:40,516
[Steven] No!

937
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:43,061
[Steven] Can't believe
you can look up there

938
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:44,270
and say there's no God.

939
00:49:44,562 --> 00:49:45,980
[Shannon] Don't start.

940
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,942
[Steven] Okay, okay.

941
00:49:50,193 --> 00:49:51,194
[exciting jazz music]

942
00:51:02,974 --> 00:51:05,059
[Shannon] Come on! I just
wanna see what it feels like.

943
00:51:05,685 --> 00:51:07,520
[Steven] Okay, well,
you gotta aim it.

944
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:08,897
[Shannon] Alright.

945
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:10,732
[both giggling]
[Shannon] Like this?

946
00:51:10,857 --> 00:51:13,109
[trickling]
[Shannon exclaiming excitedly]

947
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:14,402
[Shannon] It's weird!

948
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:16,905
[Steven] I'm getting
too excited, I can't do this.

949
00:51:16,988 --> 00:51:17,989
[Shannon]
Now, come on, it's fun!

950
00:51:18,072 --> 00:51:19,324
-Well, keep it in the bowl!
-[Shannon] Alright.

951
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:20,408
[trickling continues]

952
00:51:20,575 --> 00:51:22,118
[Steven] Okay, now
you gotta shake it off.

953
00:51:22,243 --> 00:51:23,244
[Shannon] Like that?
[Steven yelling]

954
00:51:23,286 --> 00:51:24,662
[Shannon giggling]
[Steven] Jeez!

955
00:51:24,913 --> 00:51:28,041
[Steven chuckles]
...you're wringing our towel.

956
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:29,834
-Sorry.
-Alright.

957
00:51:30,084 --> 00:51:31,085
[flushing]

958
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:33,838
So, are we past the anal
part of our relationship?

959
00:51:33,922 --> 00:51:35,465
Cuz I can't take
this thing anymore.

960
00:51:37,592 --> 00:51:39,594
[sentimental guitar music]

961
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:57,904
[Steven] Have you ever
been forced to have sex?

962
00:51:57,987 --> 00:51:58,988
Yeah.

963
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:01,074
[sentimental clarinet music]

964
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:04,327
[Steven] Describe that for me.

965
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:08,540
It was scary.

966
00:52:09,207 --> 00:52:10,542
It was...

967
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:13,545
I knew I didn't want to,

968
00:52:13,628 --> 00:52:16,297
and I said "no",
and I said "no",

969
00:52:17,173 --> 00:52:18,174
and...

970
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:22,428
He forced me to anyways, and,

971
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,057
I felt like it was my fault.

972
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:29,143
I felt like
I must've done something

973
00:52:31,688 --> 00:52:33,356
to make him do that.

974
00:52:37,986 --> 00:52:39,487
[Steven] When was that?

975
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:42,490
Um...

976
00:52:44,158 --> 00:52:45,702
When I was 14.

977
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:51,958
[Steven sighs]

978
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:55,461
[Steven] When did you say
you lost your virginity though?

979
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:56,838
14.

980
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:58,882
[Steven] So that's when
you lost your virginity?

981
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,634
-Mhm.
-[Steven] That's very traumatic.

982
00:53:03,928 --> 00:53:06,389
You know, I didn't have
any reason to be jealous.

983
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:08,349
Just my own insecurity.

984
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:12,687
She, in my mind, was better
than I thought I was, so,

985
00:53:13,396 --> 00:53:15,565
he would want that
instead of me.

986
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:25,742
[Steven]
Is the paper around here?

987
00:53:25,825 --> 00:53:27,076
I guess.

988
00:53:28,828 --> 00:53:30,205
[Steven]
Well, did you bring it in?

989
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:31,247
No.

990
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:35,627
Was I supposed to?

991
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,296
-[Steven] Well, you usually do.
-No, I don't.

992
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:41,049
Oh.

993
00:53:42,217 --> 00:53:44,385
[Steven]
So, why would you not

994
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:45,637
empty the containers
in the fridge?

995
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,388
Don't ask me.

996
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:51,226
[Steven exhales deeply]

997
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:53,186
[Steven] Alright.

998
00:53:56,522 --> 00:53:57,523
[slurping noisily]

999
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:02,737
-Do you mind?
-[Steven] What?

1000
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:04,739
Not making that noise?

1001
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:06,407
[smacking]
Is there something wrong?

1002
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:09,369
-No, you just sound like a pig.
-[Steven] It's the way I eat.

1003
00:54:09,786 --> 00:54:11,037
Well, change the way you eat.

1004
00:54:13,915 --> 00:54:14,916
What's with you?

1005
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:18,586
Nothing. I just don't like
that noise while I'm reading.

1006
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:19,712
[Steven]
Well, there's a lot of things

1007
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:20,922
I don't like about you, either.

1008
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,842
I just asked you
not to make a noise.

1009
00:54:24,926 --> 00:54:26,261
That's it. That's all.

1010
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:28,346
-Alright?
-[Steven] Oh.

1011
00:54:29,222 --> 00:54:30,515
[mimicking] Oh. Oh.

1012
00:54:34,852 --> 00:54:35,853
[continues slurping]

1013
00:54:39,732 --> 00:54:41,442
Can you see that I'm reading?

1014
00:54:42,277 --> 00:54:44,195
Why don't you clean up
a little bit or something?

1015
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:45,488
[Shannon]
I'm always cleaning up!

1016
00:54:45,613 --> 00:54:46,614
Never!

1017
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:49,993
Look, why don't you
just go back to bed, alright?

1018
00:54:50,118 --> 00:54:51,244
[Steven] Well, cuz I'm up now!

1019
00:54:51,327 --> 00:54:52,954
Well, it's only 11 o'clock.

1020
00:54:53,204 --> 00:54:54,289
You got a problem with that?

1021
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:56,332
No, maybe if you didn't sit
and bullshit all night

1022
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:57,417
in front of your computer.

1023
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,210
[Steven] It's called writing.

1024
00:54:59,919 --> 00:55:01,337
Well, I didn't see
much typing going on.

1025
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,298
What? Are you
watching over me now?

1026
00:55:03,965 --> 00:55:06,301
[Shannon] Maybe you wouldn't be
such a frustrated person

1027
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:08,094
if you actually
did work on this film.

1028
00:55:08,177 --> 00:55:09,679
Oh god, shut up!

1029
00:55:10,138 --> 00:55:11,472
You don't know shit about it.

1030
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:12,974
I don't wanna be in it anyways.

1031
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:14,309
[Steven]
Oh, that's what this is about?

1032
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,270
[Steven] If you had any memory,
you'd know it's on hold.

1033
00:55:17,353 --> 00:55:18,354
I know that.

1034
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:20,815
[continues slurping noisily]

1035
00:55:21,482 --> 00:55:22,984
Stop it!

1036
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:26,154
What the fuck are you doing?

1037
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:27,697
I just can't take it anymore,
alright?

1038
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:29,449
If you're on the rag,
just deal with it.

1039
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:30,742
None of that.

1040
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:32,660
-Leave me alone.
-Leave me alone.

1041
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:41,836
-I'll be back later.
-Yeah, alright.

1042
00:55:48,968 --> 00:55:50,595
They've got all these rules,
you know,

1043
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:52,222
"we should
never go to bed angry".

1044
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:55,099
Well, we've been to bed,
angry. [laughs]

1045
00:55:56,434 --> 00:55:57,769
They got all these [chuckles]

1046
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:01,272
I mean-- If we could
be rational, you know,

1047
00:56:01,356 --> 00:56:03,816
not to-- to follow the rules,
then you wouldn't need to fight.

1048
00:56:03,983 --> 00:56:07,028
You know, it's so stupid.
A fight is a fight.

00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:08,154
[solemn orchestral music]

1050
00:56:10,698 --> 00:56:11,783
[exhales deeply]

1051
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:35,848
I got some stuff,
do you want anything?

1052
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:37,350
No, I'm fine.

1053
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:40,895
[plastic bags rustling]

1054
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:48,152
-Is everything alright?
-Yeah, it's fine.

1055
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:52,699
I got my 3rd callback
on a commercial today.

1056
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:54,409
[flatly]
Really? That's terrific.

1057
00:56:56,744 --> 00:56:59,539
-Does that piss you off?
-No, I don't care.

1058
00:57:00,123 --> 00:57:01,749
[scoffs] You don't care?

1059
00:57:04,252 --> 00:57:05,920
I'm just gonna
go to a friend's house.

1060
00:57:12,844 --> 00:57:13,845
[sighs]

1061
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:22,770
[Steven dictating] I'm really
getting tired of Shannon's shit.

1062
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:25,106
I can't believe
the delays in the film,

1063
00:57:25,148 --> 00:57:26,774
they said they might
even quit it entirely,

1064
00:57:26,816 --> 00:57:27,817
I can't believe it.

1065
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:28,902
[typing noises]

1066
00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:30,820
I'm getting
very nervous with Shannon.

1067
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:32,238
She's starting
to get too domestic.

1068
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:33,948
I looked at her the other night,

1069
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:36,284
we were both in bed,
she had this look on her face.

1070
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:37,619
Like, we were married

1071
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:39,078
and the kids
were already at college.

1072
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:41,289
It scared the shit out of me.

1073
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,459
I don't know.

1074
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,253
I don't think
I love her that much.

1075
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:49,631
I don't know
if I love her at all.

1076
00:57:50,715 --> 00:57:51,883
I don't even know
what that means.

1077
00:57:52,217 --> 00:57:53,718
I don't wanna spend the rest of
my life with her,

1078
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:54,802
that's for damn sure.

1079
00:57:54,928 --> 00:57:55,929
I'm not ready for it.

1080
00:57:56,721 --> 00:57:57,805
She really pisses me off.

1081
00:57:57,931 --> 00:57:58,973
She's so totally selfish,

1082
00:57:59,015 --> 00:58:00,725
like I care about
her stupid commercial.

1083
00:58:02,227 --> 00:58:03,436
So what if she's doing well?

1084
00:58:04,312 --> 00:58:05,313
[sighs internally]

1085
00:58:11,027 --> 00:58:12,028
[paper ripping]

1086
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:14,072
[phone rings]

1087
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,993
[Steven] Hi. Mhm.

1088
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:22,497
Oh yeah, I found somebody else.

1089
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:25,124
Oh, it was only
three years of my life,

1090
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,167
that's good to hear.

1091
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:28,920
So, yeah.
Well we should meet then.

1092
00:58:29,712 --> 00:58:30,713
Okay.

1093
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:33,174
Alright.
Well, let me call you later.

1094
00:58:37,845 --> 00:58:38,846
[sweeping]

1095
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,900
[Steven] She had
this look like she was 60

1096
00:58:50,984 --> 00:58:51,985
and we were married.

1097
00:58:52,819 --> 00:58:54,237
I don't think
I love her that much.

1098
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:56,030
I don't think I love her at all.

1099
00:58:57,323 --> 00:58:58,533
I don't know what that means.

1100
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:01,703
I don't wanna spend the rest of
my life with her,

1101
00:59:01,786 --> 00:59:03,037
that's for damn sure.

1102
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:06,124
[sentimental piano music]

1103
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,191
[Steven laughing]

1104
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:35,069
-So, let me get the script.
-Okay.

1105
00:59:35,486 --> 00:59:38,489
-You're gonna call me, right?
-Yeah.

1106
00:59:38,656 --> 00:59:41,409
[Steven] Okay, cuz you're gonna
let me know right after, right?

1107
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:42,493
Yeah. Okay.

1108
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:44,454
I'm really glad we're
working together again.

1109
00:59:44,787 --> 00:59:45,788
Me too.

1110
00:59:45,872 --> 00:59:48,249
-Take it easy, drive safe.
-I will. Bye-bye.

1111
00:59:48,374 --> 00:59:49,375
Later.

1112
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:52,545
[sighs]

1113
01:00:03,514 --> 01:00:05,433
Uh, so we were
invited to a screening.

1114
01:00:05,475 --> 01:00:06,768
I thought,
you know, we should go.

1115
01:00:07,393 --> 01:00:08,394
I have rehearsal.

1116
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:12,690
Christine and I made up.
You know, just friends, but...

1117
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:14,776
So, what are you rehearsing?

1118
01:00:16,361 --> 01:00:17,362
The scene.

1119
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:21,449
Oh.

1120
01:00:21,532 --> 01:00:23,451
-So, are you crying?
-No.

1121
01:00:23,826 --> 01:00:25,453
-Well, what's that?
-Nothing.

1122
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:28,456
I think we should do this,
it would be fun.

1123
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:30,792
No.

1124
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:36,548
What is with you? We never
have any fun anymore, come on!

1125
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:39,217
Look, I'm late.
I don't have time. I have to go.

1126
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,718
I don't wanna talk about it.

1127
01:00:41,135 --> 01:00:44,138
Well, I didn't really wanna
just talk. I just thought,

1128
01:00:44,722 --> 01:00:47,100
we could get something going.
Communication, you know?

1129
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:50,144
Something, I don't know. [yells]
Just hit me, or something!

1130
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:52,730
[angrily] Ha,
you're really funny.

1131
01:00:53,273 --> 01:00:54,983
I mean, it's really unbelievable

1132
01:00:55,066 --> 01:00:58,027
how fucking funny
you really are.

1133
01:00:58,278 --> 01:00:59,279
[slaps]

1134
01:01:00,196 --> 01:01:01,197
What the fuck was that?

1135
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:04,158
[sarcastically] I'm sorry.
I'm real sorry. I'm so selfish.

1136
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:11,666
[jazz clarinet music]

1137
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:17,255
Either I'd try to get off
my medication, or I'd use drugs,

1138
01:01:18,214 --> 01:01:20,717
[stammers] in a period
where I was too sensitive

1139
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,552
or in a stressful situation,

1140
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:24,220
I broke up with Stephanie,

1141
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:26,848
and I got out there
and became psychotic.

1142
01:01:28,224 --> 01:01:30,602
I went through
a real difficult period

1143
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:34,314
because my relationship
with my partner fell apart.

1144
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,193
That had happened
before with other partners,

1145
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,447
but this one
was an extreme case of,

1146
01:01:43,364 --> 01:01:45,199
we'd been together,

1147
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:49,537
and seen so much together,
done so much together,

1148
01:01:49,913 --> 01:01:52,540
that when
that relationship fell apart,

1149
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:56,461
I was devastated
to the point where

1150
01:01:56,544 --> 01:01:58,880
I would admit
that I was devastated.

1151
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:02,300
And you know
about the cruelties of people.

1152
01:02:03,009 --> 01:02:06,387
I've learned a lot things
about, you know, [stammers]

1153
01:02:06,846 --> 01:02:07,847
Many times...

1154
01:02:10,558 --> 01:02:13,478
[hesitates] people have
given me rotten food.

1155
01:02:15,104 --> 01:02:18,691
and, uh [laughs]
they're really hurtful.

1156
01:02:19,943 --> 01:02:22,528
So we said go to Dad's
house for Thanksgiving.

1157
01:02:22,737 --> 01:02:25,240
She was like, "No, I'm gonna be
home late Thanksgiving dinner."

1158
01:02:25,323 --> 01:02:26,324
But she'd never show up

1159
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,327
or make dinner,
she'd be gone all night,

1160
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:32,205
I'd come home, and when
she came home she'd be trashed.

1161
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:35,917
Or all drugged up.

1162
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:41,130
And she's just somebody
who should be locked away.

1163
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:45,176
I used to get beat up, I've had
bruise marks all over my body.

1164
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:50,098
After a while,
I just kinda laid there,

1165
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:55,186
because I knew it was
no use fighting him off...

1166
01:02:59,148 --> 01:03:03,611
and then I just,
kinda, fell asleep.

1167
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:11,703
I-- you know,
I just thought it was my fault.

1168
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:15,874
My brother
ran me to the hospital.

1169
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,459
He had his friend drive.

1170
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:20,461
His friend was
a year older than him,

1171
01:03:20,712 --> 01:03:22,964
and he drove me to the hospital.

1172
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:27,802
And, I was covered
under my dad's policy.

1173
01:03:28,344 --> 01:03:31,180
So, I put it on, and...

1174
01:03:32,056 --> 01:03:33,933
my dad asked what happened.

1175
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:36,352
I just told him
I fell down a couple of steps.

1176
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:38,730
And..

1177
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:41,858
I used to hide things
very well, I'd wear sweatshirts

1178
01:03:41,983 --> 01:03:44,652
when my back would
be all bruised up from her.

1179
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:48,156
My family is very...

1180
01:03:48,823 --> 01:03:50,617
Very unique,
it's very different.

1181
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:51,993
Well, sometimes I feel like

1182
01:03:52,076 --> 01:03:55,121
I might as well have sex
with someone, because,

1183
01:03:56,664 --> 01:03:59,417
if I don't do it
on my own free will,

1184
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,377
that they can just take it.

1185
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:03,880
[Steven dictating]
She's totally flipped out.

1186
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:06,007
I don't know where
the hell she's coming from.

1187
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:08,801
In some bizarre sense,
I find it sort of amusing.

1188
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:12,222
Although it appears negative,
it's giving the film more depth.

1189
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,349
Nevermind how it's affecting me.

1190
01:04:17,518 --> 01:04:18,519
[panting]

1191
01:04:18,978 --> 01:04:20,230
[Shannon] Don... [shushes]

1192
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:22,398
-[Don] What? What?
-[Shannon] You're beautiful.

1193
01:04:22,482 --> 01:04:23,816
[Don] Me?
[Shannon giggles]

1194
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,361
-[Don] Come here.
-[Shannon] You're good at that.

1195
01:04:26,986 --> 01:04:28,821
[Shannon]
Are you gonna be alright?

1196
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:31,449
-[Don] Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.
-[Shannon] To drive?

1197
01:04:31,866 --> 01:04:34,202
-I didn't drive. Eric drove.
-[Shannon] Oh yeah.

1198
01:04:35,745 --> 01:04:36,746
[Shannon yells] Hi Eric!

1199
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:40,667
-[Shannon] Ugh, I gotta go.
-[Don] Are you gonna be okay?

1200
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:44,128
[Shannon] Yeah, oh! But I gotta
find my keys. Wait, wait.

1201
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:46,005
-[Don] Maybe in here?
-[Shannon] No!

1202
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:47,507
-[Don] Maybe in here?
-[Shannon] I'll do it! [laughs]

1203
01:04:47,966 --> 01:04:50,093
I got 'em, I got 'em.
I gotta go. Bye.

1204
01:04:50,468 --> 01:04:51,886
[Don] Bye-bye. I'll call you.

1205
01:04:52,053 --> 01:04:53,638
-[Shannon] Alright, bye.
-[Don] Bye.

1206
01:04:53,763 --> 01:04:54,764
[keys jangling]

1207
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:03,731
[typing noises]

1208
01:05:15,493 --> 01:05:16,578
What are you looking at?

1209
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:18,371
[Steven] What was that?

1210
01:05:18,413 --> 01:05:19,414
What was what?

1211
01:05:19,622 --> 01:05:20,707
[Steven] So, did you do him?

1212
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,417
[scoffs]

1213
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:23,710
Maybe I did.

1214
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,880
-Get the fuck out of my face.
-Don't talk to me like that.

1215
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:28,131
You're acting like an idiot.

1216
01:05:28,756 --> 01:05:30,091
I want you out of my house.

1217
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:31,885
[scoffs] Oh, really?

1218
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:35,763
[Steven]
Get the fuck out of here!

1219
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:40,935
[Shannon screams frustratedly]

1220
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:42,687
Is that really what you want?

1221
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,272
Yeah, that's what I want.
[yells] Get out!

1222
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:46,190
Well you better get used to it,
cuz I'm not leaving.

1223
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:48,443
-I want you out, now.
-Oh, really?

1224
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:50,987
Yeah, that's right.
Why are you doing this to me?

1225
01:05:51,112 --> 01:05:53,072
Maybe you should ask
yourself that same question.

1226
01:05:53,114 --> 01:05:54,115
What does that mean?

1227
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:56,659
-You think I'm some rag.
-What are you talking about?

1228
01:05:56,743 --> 01:05:57,744
Oh, you know!

1229
01:05:57,952 --> 01:05:59,120
-I know?
-Yes you do!

1230
01:05:59,412 --> 01:06:00,705
You know it, and I know it.

1231
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,041
And you just don't know
that I know that you know.

1232
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:05,543
What? I-- [stammers]

1233
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:07,170
I'm selfish?

1234
01:06:07,712 --> 01:06:09,464
You're the one who's selfish.

1235
01:06:09,964 --> 01:06:12,300
You and your
stupid computer secrets.

1236
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:13,885
What? You've been
reading my journal?

1237
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:14,969
Is this what this is about?

1238
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:16,012
I didn't have to.

1239
01:06:16,471 --> 01:06:18,056
You've been reading
my journal, haven't you?

1240
01:06:18,139 --> 01:06:19,641
[scoffs] Well, maybe I have.

1241
01:06:21,017 --> 01:06:23,603
-I can't believe you.
-Well, I'm really sorry.

1242
01:06:24,437 --> 01:06:27,482
That is my private world,
that's my private stuff.

1243
01:06:27,649 --> 01:06:29,275
Well it's not
so private anymore.

1244
01:06:29,442 --> 01:06:30,818
You had no right to read that.

1245
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:33,154
What fantasy are you living in?

1246
01:06:33,279 --> 01:06:35,281
[Steven] Look, I don't write
nice things in there for you.

1247
01:06:35,448 --> 01:06:37,492
That's me
talking to me at my core.

1248
01:06:37,867 --> 01:06:39,619
Yeah,
it's really rotten in there.

1249
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:43,373
Look [sighs] it's just where
I scream when I'm going crazy.

1250
01:06:43,498 --> 01:06:45,708
It's 99% nothing,
it's just ranting.

1251
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:47,544
I understand.

1252
01:06:47,752 --> 01:06:48,753
You hate me.

1253
01:06:49,045 --> 01:06:50,672
And you won't even marry me

1254
01:06:50,713 --> 01:06:52,257
because you think
you're too good for me.

1255
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,509
-[Steven] That is not true.
-Yes it is.

1256
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:56,970
[sighs]

1257
01:06:58,012 --> 01:07:02,433
It's just, when I have a moment,
and I go to write, and it's...

1258
01:07:03,268 --> 01:07:05,645
It's just
a negative time amplified.

1259
01:07:05,728 --> 01:07:08,856
It's nothing.
It's not rational truth.

1260
01:07:09,857 --> 01:07:10,858
Whatever.

1261
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:13,152
You had no right to read it.

1262
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:15,697
It was just laying on the floor
for the whole world to see.

1263
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,781
What do you expect?

1264
01:07:17,198 --> 01:07:18,825
You think I just
left it there for you?

1265
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:22,161
If I wanted out that bad,
I'd just say, "Hey, I want out.

1266
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,581
[sighs]

1267
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:29,711
Look, I didn't write
it intentionally, okay?

1268
01:07:35,049 --> 01:07:36,050
[sighs]

1269
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:39,888
I just wrote some ugly words

1270
01:07:40,388 --> 01:07:42,181
on some paper when I was upset.

1271
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:44,058
It's not really how I feel.

1272
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:49,230
I'm sorry.

1273
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,901
Hey.

1274
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:57,322
[sniffles]

1275
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:09,292
I miss you.

1276
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:11,252
[whispers] Me too.

1277
01:08:13,254 --> 01:08:14,255
[sentimental jazz music]

1278
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:08,184
[solemn clarinet music]

1279
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:13,273
Shannon?

1280
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:31,666
[Shannon dictating] Steven,

1281
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,501
I'm sorry.

1282
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:35,962
As much as you say
you wrote in anger,

1283
01:09:36,004 --> 01:09:37,505
I know you wrote
from your heart.

1284
01:09:38,464 --> 01:09:39,966
I love you very much.

1285
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:42,218
I know you don't know
what that means yet.

1286
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:44,554
I have to move out.

1287
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:46,222
I can't see you anymore.

1288
01:09:46,472 --> 01:09:48,308
So, please don't chase after me.

1289
01:09:49,017 --> 01:09:50,393
It hurts too much.

1290
01:09:52,061 --> 01:09:54,022
I have to come back
to get my things,

1291
01:09:54,105 --> 01:09:56,357
so, I'll come tomorrow around 3.

1292
01:09:56,816 --> 01:09:59,527
Please, I beg you
for my own sanity,

1293
01:09:59,569 --> 01:10:01,696
don't be there between 2 and 4.

1294
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:05,199
I love you, but
it's just not gonna work out.

1295
01:10:05,742 --> 01:10:08,745
It's over.
So let me go easy, please.

1296
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:10,455
Shannon.

1297
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,501
[sighs]

1298
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:18,504
[grunts]

1299
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:23,927
[slams door]

1300
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:25,637
[waves crashing]

1301
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:31,434
[Steve] Come on,
you're young. Unattached. Free.

1302
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:34,312
You didn't know her
before you met her.

1303
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:38,399
Hey, you haven't
called Melissa in weeks!

1304
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:41,945
And Liz was all over you
at Pam's party. And Christine...

1305
01:10:42,403 --> 01:10:43,404
Christine...

1306
01:10:43,863 --> 01:10:44,864
You're fine.

1307
01:10:45,573 --> 01:10:47,325
You'll sleep,
you'll feel better.

1308
01:10:48,493 --> 01:10:49,702
But what if I don't?

1309
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:07,011
[birds chirping]

1310
01:11:11,849 --> 01:11:13,851
[jazz clarinet music]

1311
01:11:14,018 --> 01:11:17,772
No, I feel like, you know,
saying, "I'm a human being!"

1312
01:11:18,606 --> 01:11:20,149
Don't you realize that?

1313
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:24,529
It was a perfect partnership,
you know, perfect...

1314
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:26,864
A perfect relationship.

1315
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:30,201
And then, poof.

1316
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:32,453
Over.

1317
01:11:34,163 --> 01:11:36,457
[Steven]
Is the patch related to that?

1318
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:41,462
Yeah, uh, I bloodied
my eye in an episode

1319
01:11:44,257 --> 01:11:47,760
also involved
with drugs and Jesus, and

1320
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:51,723
a number of things,
a new alarm was raised.

1321
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:53,850
If you're
having an affair, it because

1322
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,268
there's something wrong at home.

1323
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:58,313
[woman on television]
You don't just have an affair.

1324
01:11:59,022 --> 01:12:00,857
If everything is really good,

1325
01:12:01,149 --> 01:12:02,150
you're not looking.

1326
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,152
And even if something...

1327
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,322
presents itself,
you're not gonna go for it

1328
01:12:07,363 --> 01:12:08,781
if things are alright at home.

1329
01:12:08,948 --> 01:12:12,285
I tried to pluck it out,
as it says in the Bible.

1330
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:16,748
"If thy right eye offend thee,
pluck it out"

1331
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:20,835
My dad-- [stammers]
My step-mother won't talk to me.

1332
01:12:21,753 --> 01:12:25,006
Um, she tells me
to stay away from her kids.

1333
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:27,175
I have a step-brother
and step-sister,

1334
01:12:27,258 --> 01:12:29,510
and I'm supposed to stay away
from my little sister.

1335
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:34,349
My sister doesn't talk to me.
She lives with my dad now.

1336
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:36,601
She doesn't talk to me,
she thinks that

1337
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,187
I could've done
better for my life.

1338
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:40,730
If you're in love,

1339
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:43,858
you'll do anything
to make the other person happy.

1340
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,985
It's centered
on the other person,

1341
01:12:46,027 --> 01:12:47,737
it's not centered on...

1342
01:12:48,321 --> 01:12:50,531
fulfilling your own needs.

1343
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:52,033
[door creaks]

1344
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:53,076
Steven?

1345
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,621
Steven?

1346
01:12:58,581 --> 01:12:59,582
[door slams]

1347
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:00,708
[heels clacking]

1348
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:44,878
Why couldn't you make
things simple, like I asked?

1349
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:46,462
I want you to stay.

1350
01:13:46,629 --> 01:13:47,630
You're so full of shit.

1351
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:50,884
[sighs]

1352
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:52,802
I love you.

1353
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:54,345
[Shannon scoffs]

1354
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,473
[sarcastically]
Oh, all a sudden,

1355
01:13:57,557 --> 01:13:59,434
[stammers] I don't
sleepover one night in your bed,

1356
01:13:59,517 --> 01:14:02,061
and you have found
this wonderful love for me.

1357
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:06,274
Move.

1358
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,151
I love you.

1359
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:11,112
Don't say that,
you're trying to manipulate me.

1360
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:12,280
[Steven sighs]

1361
01:14:13,948 --> 01:14:15,241
I want you to stay.

1362
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:17,535
What exactly
are you trying to say?

1363
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,621
[Steven] I love you and
I want you to stay here with me.

1364
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,040
[scoffs] Sorry, I can't.

1365
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:23,333
[Steven] Please.

1366
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:26,502
Well, so, what? [stammers]

1367
01:14:26,961 --> 01:14:27,962
You wanna marry me?

1368
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,633
[stammers]

1369
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:34,594
Do you wanna get married?

1370
01:14:34,886 --> 01:14:36,095
[raises voice]
I don't know! I don't know.

1371
01:14:36,554 --> 01:14:37,555
I gotta go.

1372
01:14:37,847 --> 01:14:39,307
[Steven]
Why do we have to get married?

1373
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,934
Because that's
the bottom line, alright!

1374
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:42,644
[yelling] You either
make a commitment to me,

1375
01:14:42,727 --> 01:14:44,520
and you know that it's for life,
and you truly love me,

1376
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:45,605
or you don't!

1377
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:47,649
[sighs]

1378
01:14:47,815 --> 01:14:48,816
[Steven stammers] I love you!

1379
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,777
Look, I don't wanna
listen to your shit anymore.

1380
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:55,657
[Shannon] I mean,
you wanna marry me, or what?

1381
01:14:57,909 --> 01:14:58,910
Cuz...

1382
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:00,870
I'm pregnant.

1383
01:15:03,164 --> 01:15:04,582
What do you mean,
you're pregnant?

1384
01:15:04,832 --> 01:15:06,793
-[Shannon] That's right.
-You're pregnant?

1385
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:09,087
I'm not lying to you.

1386
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:13,174
[sighs]

1387
01:15:13,925 --> 01:15:14,926
Come on.

1388
01:15:15,343 --> 01:15:16,761
[scoffs] You're pathetic.

1389
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:19,764
Don't cheat.

1390
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:23,184
So what is this?
This a shotgun deal, right?

1391
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,353
Look, I wasn't gonna tell you.

1392
01:15:26,437 --> 01:15:29,107
I just thought it would be nice
to give the kid a chance

1393
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:32,068
[stammers] at something
approximating a normal life.

1394
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,237
And I also thought maybe,

1395
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,156
just maybe, you love me...

1396
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:39,409
I don't have
any say in this at all?

1397
01:15:40,243 --> 01:15:41,244
Well, I'm not gonna
have an abortion,

1398
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:42,328
if that's what you think.

1399
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,913
Well, I mean,
there's nothing I could--

1400
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,207
we could talk about,
or something--

1401
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,710
I don't know. I mean,
it's half mine, right?

1402
01:15:50,545 --> 01:15:54,007
Possession is nine-tenths
the law, and she's mine.

1403
01:15:54,048 --> 01:15:55,049
[sighs deeply]

1404
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:58,136
And I'm going to have her
with or without you.

1405
01:16:02,348 --> 01:16:03,349
[sighs]

1406
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:05,226
This is for real?

1407
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:07,395
Yeah, well, mistakes happen.

1408
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:12,191
Boy, you sure bought into

1409
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:13,943
a lot of commitment
this time, didn't you?

1410
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:20,742
Look, I'm not gonna
stick around with some asshole

1411
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,203
who's hot and cold
on me while I'm having a baby.

1412
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,289
[Shannon]
Alright? You gotta decide now.

1413
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,917
No divorce.

1414
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:31,252
No fucking around
with other women.

1415
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:33,630
No out, nothing. Alright?

1416
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,591
Time to put your money
where your mouth is.

1417
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,179
Time to grow up.

1418
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,228
[seagulls chirping]

1419
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:53,942
[door slams]

1420
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:59,697
[tense orchestral music]

1421
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,691
[slams]

1422
01:17:37,026 --> 01:17:38,027
[yells] Shannon!

1423
01:17:51,082 --> 01:17:53,084
[intense upbeat music]

1424
01:18:00,049 --> 01:18:01,050
[engine starting]

1425
01:18:03,344 --> 01:18:04,345
[car honking]

1426
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,847
[music intensifies]

1427
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:29,704
[music fades out]

1428
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,042
[lock clicks]

1429
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:38,838
What the hell are you doing?
Trying to kill me?

1430
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,006
[Shannon] [weakly] Yeah.

1431
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:41,466
[Steven] Come here.

1432
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,180
What was that for?

1433
01:18:47,388 --> 01:18:48,389
You pissed me off.

1434
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:51,017
I'm sorry.

1435
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:53,061
So, what took you
so long to decide?

1436
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,396
I had to make sure.

1437
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:57,482
So did I.

1438
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,401
[sentimental jazz music]

1439
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:14,958
[slow romantic music]

1440
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:20,088
âª I lose my mind âª

1441
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:25,885
âª When I find
You're not with me âª

1442
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:28,763
âª Out of control âª

1443
01:19:29,138 --> 01:19:32,308
âª When you're right by my side âª

1444
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:36,437
[stammers] Yeah, I didn't want
a bar-mitzvah at 13 years old.

1445
01:19:38,147 --> 01:19:39,148
Um...

1446
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:44,320
I made a mistake
somewhere [unintelligible]

1447
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:49,617
Not the Torah portion,
the English portion, I--

1448
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:53,162
I dunno, I panicked
[stammers] inside, and then,

1449
01:19:53,329 --> 01:19:56,082
it became a blur,
things got a little worse,

1450
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,126
and then it got Hebrew part

1451
01:19:58,167 --> 01:19:59,168
[laughs]

1452
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:02,672
Things got a little worse, then
all a sudden, I just passed out.

1453
01:20:02,755 --> 01:20:04,757
Boom! On the floor, you know.

1454
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:07,343
My dad caught me
before I hit the floor.

1455
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,222
They carried me out for
half an hour, then I came back.

1456
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:13,516
Faced the Torah portion, and--

1457
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,645
It was
an embarrassing situation.

1458
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:18,980
[music continues]

1459
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:24,861
âª The only one
You could never live without âª

1460
01:20:27,196 --> 01:20:31,409
He said to her, "Have you ever
seen an X-rated movie?"

1461
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:34,787
And my aunt said, "No."

1462
01:20:35,496 --> 01:20:38,166
"Would you like to see one?"
"Okay."

1463
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,168
So I think
they went to see, like,

1464
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,003
The Devil in Miss Jones ,
or something.

1465
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:45,798
But they got there late, they
missed the first 50 minutes,

1466
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,009
and so through the whole movie,
my aunt's going,

1467
01:20:48,092 --> 01:20:51,930
[gasping] "Oh god. Oh my god!
Oh, what is he doing to her?"

1468
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,140
"Oh, why is she
letting him do-- Oh wha--"

1469
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,143
And at the end of the movie,

1470
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,021
my mother said, "Well,
we missed the first 50 minutes."

1471
01:21:00,104 --> 01:21:01,356
"Do you wanna stay
for the beginning?"

1472
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:02,649
And my aunt said, "Okay!"

1473
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,691
[laughs]

1474
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:06,069
[romantic pop music continues]

1475
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:09,239
âª You make me strong âª

1476
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:15,036
âª Now make me know
Where I belong âª

1477
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:17,497
If you only have
a mistress and not a wife,

1478
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,540
that's even better,

1479
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:23,378
cuz then you have the energy
to do other things. [chuckles]

1480
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:29,676
âª You've become the only one âª

1481
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,888
[Steven] They say you marry the
person you're standing next to

1482
01:21:34,138 --> 01:21:35,431
when you're
ready to get married.

1483
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,642
And I was standing
next to Shannon.

1484
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,645
Do I understand love now?
Honestly?

1485
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:42,105
No.

1486
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,399
It wasn't something she said,
or something she did.

1487
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,483
She just sorta grew on me.

1488
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:49,070
I guess love is in the...
eye of the beholder.

1489
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:51,114
[slow romantic pop music]

1490
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:54,826
âª Take me for your lover âª

1491
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,299
âª My heart is shaking âª

1492
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:13,553
âª You take my breath away âª

1493
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:18,433
âª Take my breath away âª

1494
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:23,938
âª Come take my breath away âª

1495
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,316
âª Take me with your heart âª

1496
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:30,904
âª Take me with your soul âª

1497
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,531
I always give them three
little things that I tell them,

1498
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:34,741
when I first start dating them.

1499
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:36,910
"Don't fuck with me.
Don't fuck with my family.

1500
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:38,244
"Don't fuck with my car."

1501
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,121
If you can get through that,
you're fine.

1502
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:43,374
[music stops]

1503
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,628
[receding footsteps]
