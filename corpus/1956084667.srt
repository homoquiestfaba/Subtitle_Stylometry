00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,664
Oh. No, look over there.

3
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:27,125
- Look over there.
- Look.

4
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:28,211
All right.

5
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,367
Let's take a picture, one...

6
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:33,617
You say "cheese", okay, one...

7
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:34,882
- Say "cheese".
- Two...

8
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,742
- Cheese!
- Three.

9
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:22,501
The four and the one.
That's your two.

10
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:23,763
There you go.

11
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,668
Four, one, four, one...

12
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:27,255
four one, and then five.

13
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,185
When you're ready,
you can switch to five.

14
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:38,375
Look what I got.

15
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,298
What is that?

16
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:42,024
What, you don't know Pokémon?

17
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:01,828
Faster, faster.

18
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:02,923
Smile.

19
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,015
I wanna try it as a video.

20
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,118
Just slide the thing.

21
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:29,126
Video log 3.7.

22
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,719
I have reason to believe
my wife's a robot.

23
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,712
Seems she could run for miles.

24
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:35,219
Wait up.

25
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,681
Stop!

26
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,236
Ahh!

27
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,252
Everybody's grounded.

28
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,001
Wee!

29
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,213
Yes! Margot!

30
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,806
Video log 6.7.

31
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,463
I think we can, I think we can,
I think we...

32
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,721
Pam?

33
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,158
Pam?

34
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,180
Hey, Dad!

35
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,297
Hey, sweetheart.

36
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,672
How's it going?

37
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,625
Um, good!

38
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:01,695
What's up with the FaceTime?

39
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:02,891
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

40
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,563
What is wrong with this picture?

41
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:06,688
I'm about to be in
trouble, aren't I?

42
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,688
Yes.

43
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:11,654
Yup.

44
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,086
Maybe we should keep the
trash in your room? Huh?

45
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,477
Maybe the smell will remind you.

46
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:20,258
I'm sorry, Dad.
It won't happen again.

47
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,358
Okay.

48
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,550
Where are you, by the way?

49
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:24,558
Study group.

50
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:26,300
Ah. Whose house are you at?

51
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,902
Uh, one of my friends in bio,
you haven't met her yet.

52
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:31,105
Oh, Miss Popular. When
are you gonna be home?

53
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,276
I... think we're gonna go late.

54
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:34,799
Late, like-like, nine-ish or...?

55
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:37,050
Late, like, all night probably.

56
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:38,753
I thought we were gonna
eat dinner together?

57
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,300
We ate together on Monday.

58
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,511
Didn't know you were counting.

59
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,245
Right... I should get back.

60
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,345
Oh, one more thing,
I wanna know about

61
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,065
- Bye, Dad!
- the final you...

62
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:51,683
took today.

63
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,110
Uh, yo, what am I lookin' at?

64
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:16,079
E...xactly.

65
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:19,305
I cannot remember the
name of this thing...

66
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,485
uh, it was like a kimchi,

67
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,735
okra, mussels stew?

68
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,438
Pam used to make it?

69
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:28,829
Oh, the kimchi gumbo.

70
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,508
- Gumbo. Gumbo, that's it.
- Yup.

71
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,126
Do you have the recipe?

72
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,407
'Cause I'm definitely
forgetting something.

73
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:35,547
Yeah, I might...

74
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,923
but I can definitely tell you
there's no pot in it.

75
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:41,680
Oh. This?

76
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:46,352
Healthy and organic jar of...
oregano?

77
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,719
How much are you smokin'?

78
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:50,805
You doin' everyday or?

79
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,547
- You do it at work?
- Dude.

80
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,024
Can we not do this right now?
Please?

81
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:56,454
It's been a long day.

82
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,212
Ah, edamame.

83
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,735
I'm pretty sure there's
edamame in it.

84
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:09,126
Let me
find the actual thing.

85
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,196
What's uh...

86
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,243
What's Margot up to tonight?

87
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,149
She's at a
study group all night.

88
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,477
Wait, all night tonight?

89
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:20,875
Yeah, I just got off
the phone with her.

90
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:22,695
She's got a
bio final next week.

91
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,844
Why?

92
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:25,258
Oh, nothin'.

93
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:26,891
She's good, though?

94
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:28,935
Yeah. Why do you ask?

95
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,777
Making sure you guys are
both talking to each other.

96
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:33,349
Both happy, etcetera, etcetera.

97
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,263
Everything's fine, Peter.
Thanks for askin'.

98
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:42,232
Hey, look, Davey...

99
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,566
Do you think that maybe
you should just...

100
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:46,224
Dude, everything's fine.

101
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,856
Hey, uh, I gotta go

102
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:57,443
but send me that recipe, please?

103
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,638
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

104
00:10:58,663 --> 00:10:59,849
Love you.

105
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,708
- Byeee.
- Byeee.

106
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:29,950
- Make sure you get all the water out.
- Are these ready?

107
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,880
Yeah, they're ready...

108
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:40,029
Yeah, drain all the water.

109
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:42,966
Turn it off.

110
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,919
Let's stir it in.
We gotta mix those up first.

111
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,880
- You wanna try mixing it?
- Yeah.

112
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,310
Okay, here.

113
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:57,958
Good.

114
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,123
Good. Gently, do it slowly.

115
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,740
Do you see how
those are all done?

116
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,716
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

117
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:19,920
<i>Hey, you're reached
Margot's phone.</i>

118
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:21,812
<i>Leave me a message
or text me back.</i>

119
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,093
Hi, sweetheart, sorry I missed
your call. I was asleep.

120
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,146
Um, just checkin' in 'cause
it looks like

121
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,983
you already left for
school this morning.

122
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:31,569
Um, also, what time
did you get in last night?

123
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:33,951
All right, give me text
when you get this.

124
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:36,741
No need to call.
We both know you usually...

125
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:39,889
forget.

126
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:24,872
David, you with us?

127
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,449
Yeah. Sorry.

128
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,387
I'm here.

129
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:30,051
Do you have the integration
report on the Bellington system?

130
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,184
Um, Engineering is
still running tests

131
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,403
but uh, I should be able
to integrate by Monday.

132
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:37,044
Put some pressure
on 'em, all right?

133
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,278
Yeah, pressure.

134
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,789
Okay, team, anything we forgot?

135
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,883
- I think that's it.
- All right.

136
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,766
- Have a good weekend.
- Thank you.

137
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,063
All right, see ya.

138
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:18,905
<i>Hey, you've reached
Margot's phone.</i>

139
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,482
<i>Leave me a message
or text me back.</i>

140
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,741
Hey, Margot, Dad again.

141
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:27,216
I'm not sure if you've been
checking your messages, but um,

142
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,038
I'm starting to get a little...

143
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:31,633
Why did you leave
your laptop at home?

144
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:36,999
Okay, uh, it is 3:30,
one hour after school ended

145
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:39,140
on Friday, May 12th...

146
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,905
Duh, okay. It's Friday.

147
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,530
I know where you are.
All right.

148
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,460
Ignore this message.
I love you. Bye.

149
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:25,920
<i>Hello?</i>

150
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,441
Hi, uh, Mrs. Shahinian?

151
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:28,185
<i>Yes.</i>

152
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,646
This is David Kim,
Margot's father.

153
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:33,471
<i>Yes, I'm in the middle of a lesson.
May I call you back afterwards?</i>

154
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,688
Right, no, this is just,
take a second...

155
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:38,877
Can you put my daughter on
the phone just for a second?

156
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:41,759
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim, I'm confused
what you're calling about.

157
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:46,049
M-My daughter, Margot Kim
is in a lesson with you right now?

158
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:51,345
<i>Margot Kim canceled her
classes six months ago.</i>

159
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:54,698
What...?

160
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,956
<i>Is she looking
to restart lessons?</i>

161
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,752
Hold on, that...

162
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:04,487
doesn't make any sense.
She loves piano.

163
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,712
<i>Mr. Kim, is everything okay?</i>

164
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,868
Yes, um...

165
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:14,868
everything's fine.

166
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,906
Thank you. Thank you,
Mrs. Shahinian.

167
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,448
Pick up, pick up, pick up...

168
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,720
<i>Hello?</i>

169
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:08,236
Hi, um, I'm David Kim,
I'm Margot Kim's...

170
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,613
<i>Pam's husband, oh,
of course I remember.</i>

171
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,142
<i>How are you doing?</i>

172
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,597
I'm good, I'm good.

173
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,206
Listen, the reason
I'm calling is that um...

174
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,041
I haven't been able
to reach Margot

175
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:19,743
for a little bit and I'm
sure her phone is dead

176
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,018
but I was just wondering if I
could speak to Isaac and see...

177
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:24,786
<i>Well, it's gotta be more of
a reception problem, right?</i>

178
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:27,129
Uh, what do you mean?

179
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:28,920
<i>You know, if they're
on the mountains...</i>

180
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:31,365
Sorry, w-what mountains?

181
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:35,107
<i>Camping. Isaac is
camping with his friends.</i>

182
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:37,045
<i>Margot was definitely invited.</i>

183
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:38,982
She was?

184
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,294
<i>I'm pretty positive
she's there, too.</i>

185
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,888
<i>Did she... not tell you?</i>

186
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:48,127
Shh...she did. I'm uh...

187
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:49,571
Yeah, I'm looking
at her texts now.

188
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:52,024
She didn't mention
mountains, that's why, yeah.

189
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,884
<i>Yeah, they've been
planning this for a while.</i>

190
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:55,063
<i>I can't imagine
she just couldn't...</i>

191
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,431
Do you happen to know
when they left?

192
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:58,283
The reason I'm asking is that

193
00:21:58,353 --> 00:22:00,236
school has her marked
as absent today.

194
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:01,713
<i>Did they all ditch school?</i>

195
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:03,813
<i>I'll tell you something,
if that's what they did,</i>

196
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:05,447
<i>Isaac is in big trouble!</i>

197
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:09,408
That's-that's definitely
what happened.

198
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,026
- Okay, this is...
<i>- Tell you what,</i>

199
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,352
<i>They're planning on heading
back tomorrow morning, anyway.</i>

200
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:15,572
<i>Once they get reception,
I will let Isaac know</i>

201
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:16,940
<i>to have Margot
give you a call.</i>

202
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:18,322
Perfect, that is perfect.
Thank you.

203
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,955
<i>Is everything okay
with you two?</i>

204
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,883
What do you mean?

205
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,401
<i>Well, I just haven't
spoken to you since...</i>

206
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,676
<i>Pam's, uh...</i>

207
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh, oh, thank you.

208
00:22:26,785 --> 00:22:27,971
Everything is great.

209
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,955
Margot and I are great.

210
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,457
Hello?

211
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:19,833
<i>Hey, Mr. Kim?</i>

212
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:21,425
<i>This is Isaac.
My mom told me to...</i>

213
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,190
Isaac! Yes, hi.

214
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,714
Sorry to have you
call me so early.

215
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,697
<i>It's okay.</i>

216
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:27,917
<i>Just wanna say I'm sorry
I couldn't be of more help.</i>

217
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:31,003
Yeah, can you put my daughter
on the phone, please?

218
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:33,932
<i>Did my mom not tell you?</i>

219
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,784
What, what do you mean?

220
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:39,339
<i>She never came.</i>

221
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:41,472
What? What do you...?

222
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:43,238
Isaac, what do you mean?

223
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:44,346
<i>I mean, she never came.</i>

224
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:46,095
<i>I even reached out to her
after school on Friday</i>

225
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,229
<i>when we were
all heading out</i>

226
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:48,716
<i>in my car so I'd
know she'll see.</i>

227
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,370
What did she say?

228
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:55,355
<i>She didn't respond.</i>

229
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:02,947
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

230
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,665
Hi, I'm calling
about a possible... I...

231
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,635
I'm calling to report
a missing person.

232
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:09,158
<i>Okay, who is this regarding?</i>

233
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,447
Uh, my daughter.

234
00:24:10,502 --> 00:24:12,516
I know I should've called
sooner. I just thought that...

235
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,798
<i>- That's okay, sir.</i>
- Yeah.

236
00:24:13,861 --> 00:24:15,783
<i>The first thing we need
to do is file a report.</i>

237
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,205
<i>After that, I'll put out a call
to a detective in the area</i>

238
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:19,869
<i>who will be in touch with you.</i>

239
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,056
All right.

240
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,986
<i>Now let's start with her name.</i>

241
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:27,353
Uh, Margot Kim, Ma-
M-A-R-G-O-T.

242
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,861
Kim, K-I-M.

243
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:38,705
<i>Hi, is this David Kim?</i>

244
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,431
Yes. Uh, this is David Kim.
I'm assuming this is...

245
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:44,260
<i>Good morning, Mr. Kim.
My name is Rosemary Vick.</i>

246
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,846
<i>I'm the detective sergeant
assigned to your daughter's case.</i>

247
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:48,892
Yeah, good morning.
I've been waiting for your call.

248
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,190
<i>Of course. We're working
as fast as we can.</i>

249
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:53,994
<i>I'm currently 35 minutes
away from your house.</i>

250
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:55,369
<i>But while I have you,</i>

251
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:57,776
<i>do you feel comfortable
telling me what you know?</i>

252
00:24:57,939 --> 00:24:59,900
I just told every detail I know

253
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:01,782
to whoever I got off the
phone with an hour ago.

254
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:02,812
I don't know what
you guys are doing.

255
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:04,618
<i>I promise you, Mr. Kim,</i>

256
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:06,541
<i>we are taking this
very seriously.</i>

257
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:08,843
<i>And as a parent myself,
I can only imagine</i>

258
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:10,330
<i>what you must be feeling.</i>

259
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:11,353
<i>But for me to help you,</i>

260
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:14,181
<i>I do need to know
how everything unfolded</i>

261
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:15,688
<i>from your eyes.</i>

262
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:17,759
Understood,

263
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:19,829
detective.

264
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:26,349
<i>Okay, let's see
if I got this right.</i>

265
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:30,240
<i>One: after a group study session,</i>

266
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:33,755
<i>Margot, with her car, didn't
return home Thursday evening.</i>

267
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:36,810
<i>Two:</i>

268
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,404
<i>she called three times
at 11:00 p.m.</i>

269
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:42,543
<i>Three:</i>

270
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:44,701
<i>she didn't attend school on Friday.</i>

271
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:46,677
<i>And four:</i>

272
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:48,403
<i>she's been skipping
piano classes</i>

273
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:49,920
<i>for the last six months.</i>

274
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:51,459
<i>Was all of that correct?</i>

275
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:52,396
Yes.

276
00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:54,068
<i>Okay. Mr. Kim,</i>

277
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,373
<i>I am going to find out
what happened to your daughter.</i>

278
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:59,146
<i>But I'll need to know a
lot more about her, okay?</i>

279
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:00,599
Yes, yes, uh...

280
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:03,482
What do you want me to do?
I-I-I'll go talk to neighbors,

281
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:05,670
<i>We'll handle the ground
investigation, Mr. Kim.</i>

282
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:06,763
<i>That's our job.</i>

283
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,935
<i>But if there's something
a parent can do,</i>

284
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:12,045
<i>it's shedding light for us
on who your daughter is</i>

285
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:13,943
<i>and the people she talks to.</i>

286
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:20,638
<i>Is that something
you can help us with?</i>

287
00:26:22,318 --> 00:26:23,295
Yes.

288
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,607
I can help with that.

289
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,202
<i>Okay.</i>

290
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,632
<i>It's already been 36 hours
since Margot's last call.</i>

291
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,679
<i>So we've gotta move
a little quickly.</i>

292
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,156
<i>We'll be taking a copy of
Margot's hard drive to forensics.</i>

293
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:51,585
<i>But in the meantime,</i>

294
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:54,601
<i>any information
you can give me about her</i>

295
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:57,757
<i>or the people around her
will help.</i>

296
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:01,648
<i>Wait, you can't find Margot?</i>

297
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,007
No, uh, I can't.

298
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,811
Do you mind answering some
questions for me to help?

299
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:05,929
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

300
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,788
Okay, when was the
last time you saw her?

301
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,781
<i>Uh, Tuesday.
Her locker's near me.</i>

302
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:13,225
All right, on Thursday evening,
she attended a study group

303
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,413
for her biology class.

304
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:15,640
Do you know anything
about that?

305
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:17,257
<i>She's probably in AP Bio, right?</i>

306
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:18,875
Yes, she is.

307
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,672
<i>Yeah, no, I'm in regular.</i>

308
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,734
Okay, what were you doing
Thursday night?

309
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:26,281
<i>Thursday night, I was
at my dad's house.</i>

310
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,367
<i>Yeah, he picked me up
after finals that day.</i>

311
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,148
All right, thank you, Jonah.

312
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:33,664
How does uh,
how does this look?

313
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:39,015
Perfect.

314
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,922
Hey, update me whenever
you learn something.

315
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,218
- Big or small.
- Okay.

316
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,521
Where are you going?

317
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:46,859
Find out what the rest of
her Thursday looked like.

318
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:50,265
Oh, oh, and share that
with me too.

319
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:00,714
And what about Thursday night?

320
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,517
<i>Thursday night, I was finishing
up my final paper for English.</i>

321
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,768
<i>I dunno, Xbox, dinner,
some Netflix?</i>

322
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:09,727
<i>Oh, I just finished my
last final which means</i>

323
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,979
<i>I was at Carmen's house
playing pong.</i>

324
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:14,408
<i>P-Ping-pong.</i>

325
00:30:19,346 --> 00:30:21,463
What about study group?
Do you know who hosted that?

326
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:23,221
<i>I took bio last year, so, no.</i>

327
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:24,120
<i>No idea.</i>

328
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:25,596
<i>She and I were on
different AP paths,</i>

329
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:26,854
<i>so it was kinda hard
to keep tabs.</i>

330
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,159
But you guys were friends.

331
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:30,753
Kind of.

332
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:31,658
What are you talking about?

333
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:33,494
You invited her on
that camping trip.

334
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:36,235
Well, yeah, I mean,
you know my mom.

335
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,440
Yes, so?

336
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:40,416
She was really good friends
with Margot's mom.

337
00:30:40,768 --> 00:30:41,846
Okay, so?

338
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,518
She felt bad

339
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,354
about everything that
happened to you guys.

340
00:30:48,956 --> 00:30:51,065
But she h-has friends, right?

341
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,494
<i>Define friends.</i>

342
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:55,073
Do people invite her to things?

343
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,971
<i>I think people occasionally
invited her to things.</i>

344
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:57,909
<i>She just never comes.</i>

345
00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:59,151
<i>She keeps to herself
a lot.</i>

346
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:00,314
<i>She's quiet.</i>

347
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:02,120
<i>I did see her
eat lunch alone.</i>

348
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:03,542
On Thursday?

349
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,393
<i>Every day.</i>

350
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,346
Davey, look,

351
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:12,276
I know you don't wanna hear
this from me right now.

352
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:13,917
But you've gotta take it easy.

353
00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:16,620
I-I can help with everything
that you're looking through.

354
00:31:16,784 --> 00:31:18,964
Are there any Facebook friends
you haven't talked to yet?

355
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:21,361
Yes. 94.

356
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,643
And apparently, since nobody
was actually her friend,

357
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:25,253
I don't know who to
talk to without calling

358
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:27,361
every name I read online.

359
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:30,831
What about offline?

360
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,446
<i>Yeah, that was at my place.</i>

361
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:56,985
That was your place?

362
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,797
You hosted the study group
on Thursday night for bio?

363
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:00,610
<i>Yeah.</i>

364
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:02,860
So you were with Margot for
the majority of the night?

365
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:05,391
<i>Well, the study group
only went till 9:00.</i>

366
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:07,604
No, no, she said
it was going all night.

367
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,666
No, she definitely left at 9:00.

368
00:32:09,768 --> 00:32:11,260
Maybe even earlier.

369
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:14,862
Did she say
where she was going?

370
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,401
Not really.

371
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:17,892
How'd she look?
Was she worried?

372
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,370
Did she look scared?
Was she talking?

373
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,932
Honestly, I don't know.

374
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:22,102
We're not really that close.

375
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:24,104
Why did you invite
her to study group?!

376
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,658
I'm trying to get into
Berkeley next year.

377
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:31,799
Okay, you were...

378
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:34,151
You were in her class, though.
Did she

379
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,315
mention anything unusual
going on, maybe?

380
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:37,877
Was she acting strange?

381
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:39,088
Uh...

382
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,034
You know, she did
go on Tumblr a lot.

383
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,275
What? What is a tumbler?

384
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:23,863
<i>First, she fills up for gas.</i>

385
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,925
<i>Then exits off the 101.</i>

386
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,292
<i>And then turns onto
the 152 east.</i>

387
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:36,941
<i>10:02 p.m.</i>

388
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,050
152 east?

389
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,464
That exits leads outta town.

390
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,142
She took it alone.

391
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,550
That doesn't make sense.

392
00:33:57,575 --> 00:33:59,128
This does not sound
like my daughter.

393
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:00,777
She's acting like
a totally different person.

394
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:02,808
Okay, hold on, hold on.
You just gave me an idea.

395
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:05,706
In the meantime,

396
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:09,277
start expanding from only the
people she communicated with.

397
00:34:09,558 --> 00:34:11,792
Look into her behavior also.

398
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:48,978
Oh, my God.

399
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:50,189
What?

400
00:34:50,228 --> 00:34:52,361
She's been depositing
her piano cash

401
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:54,275
into her checking
account every week.

402
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:56,135
The hell was she doing
with all that money?

403
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,959
Six days ago, she made
an outgoing transaction

404
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:03,857
of $2,500

405
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:05,342
to Venmo.

406
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,709
The payment service?

407
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,224
There it is. $2,500.

408
00:35:12,638 --> 00:35:14,053
Six days ago.

409
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,794
Does it say what it was for?

410
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,224
Nothing but a peace sign.

411
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,576
Who did she send it to?

412
00:35:24,326 --> 00:35:25,467
It doesn't say.

413
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:26,568
Okay.

414
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:27,818
That's weird.

415
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,287
That's really weird.

416
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:34,513
You don't think she's involved
with anything serious, right?

417
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,723
Davey?

418
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:39,513
I don't know. I gotta go.

419
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,664
<i>Sir, I don't have to
tell you anything.</i>

420
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:55,358
I just want to know
where you were

421
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:56,961
the night my daughter
went missing.

422
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:59,836
<i>Like I said, I had a
prior engagement.</i>

423
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:01,109
- What are you hiding?
<i>- I was busy.</i>

424
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,680
- What are you hiding?
<i>- Nothing!</i>

425
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:04,078
Then answer the damn question

426
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:05,719
before there's a cop
knocking on your door.

427
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:08,297
Where were you the night
my daughter went missing?!

428
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:38,936
Hello?

429
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:41,100
<i>Does the name
Rachel Jeun ring a bell?</i>

430
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:46,796
No. Why?

431
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:52,647
It's Margot.

432
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:55,170
<i>You mentioned earlier she was
acting like a different person.</i>

433
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:58,319
<i>So I had our forensics team look
through any deleted contacts</i>

434
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:00,374
<i>on the copy of her hard drive.</i>

435
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:03,842
<i>One of those contacts
was a local forger.</i>

436
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,522
<i>He said Margot picked up
an ID a few days ago.</i>

437
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:09,694
<i>Around the same time,
she withdrew all that money.</i>

438
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,686
Withdrew?

439
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,616
What? Withdrew what money?

440
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:17,600
<i>David, I also spoke to
security at Venmo.</i>

441
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,366
<i>To find out more
about the account</i>

442
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:21,452
<i>Margot sent the $2,500 to.</i>

443
00:38:21,522 --> 00:38:23,116
Do they know
who it belonged to?

444
00:38:23,444 --> 00:38:24,991
<i>It belonged to Margot.</i>

445
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:32,007
She sent the money to herself?

446
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,388
What was she doing? Running a-
a laundering scheme?

447
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:35,819
<i>That's what it looks like.</i>

448
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:39,163
<i>I'd see this a lot in narcotics.</i>

449
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,216
<i>People who know their
money's being watched</i>

450
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:44,124
<i>just transfer their funds to
somewhere much less monitored.</i>

451
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:45,726
Less monitored. Like where?

452
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,565
The Internet.

453
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:58,869
She gets a fake ID, she
sends money to herself.

454
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,190
What does this mean?

455
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:04,393
<i>That it's time to start
considering the possibility</i>

456
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,471
<i>that Margot ran away.</i>

457
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,522
Why would she do that?

458
00:39:12,944 --> 00:39:14,538
<i>That's what we don't know.</i>

459
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:16,333
Why would she do that?

460
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:18,554
She called me three times
in the middle of the night.

461
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:20,077
Three times she called me, why?

462
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,515
<i>We're going to figure out why.</i>

463
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:22,779
<i>So, what I want to
look for now...</i>

464
00:39:22,804 --> 00:39:25,476
No, no, no, no, no.

465
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,147
I know my daughter.

466
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:28,835
She did not run away.

467
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,829
Dude. This is a good angle.

468
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,728
Also, to all my fans,

469
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,165
I know this vlog
is a little late.

470
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:37,407
Favorite concert
in the last year?

471
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,923
Definitely Twenty One Pilots.

472
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,422
Well, thank you for
the compliment, Lucy.

473
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:46,421
Oh, this is a
Fearless core shirt,

474
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,047
cost me like 40 bucks.

475
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,195
Um...

476
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:53,375
H-How would I
be able to see you?

477
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,211
Okay, well, you know what?

478
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,758
You guys keep commenting,
but honestly, if it's kinda...

479
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,683
Ugh.

480
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:43,324
Hold on.

481
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:00,558
It's Uxie.

482
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:03,144
It can wipe out memories.

483
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:04,753
It's kinda cute.

484
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,753
How'd you know
I like Pokémon?

485
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:11,676
A lot of people, actually.

486
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:13,793
I mean, ever since
they started...

487
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,457
This one I took at a lake.

488
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,295
This one I took at a forest.

489
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,177
That...

490
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm Margot.

491
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,740
I'm 15. Almost 16.

492
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:52,084
Student.

493
00:43:55,037 --> 00:43:56,318
San Jose.

494
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,185
What's that like?

495
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,505
Trust me, it's probably
better than this.

496
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,279
This is it.

497
00:44:16,412 --> 00:44:18,388
Best place in the world
to do nothing.

498
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,998
You work 25 hours
on top of school?

499
00:45:15,108 --> 00:45:17,819
My dad doesn't know
I stopped going to piano.

500
00:45:26,717 --> 00:45:28,092
He wouldn't get it.

501
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:34,460
Anyway.

502
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:35,717
Don't you guys have...?

503
00:45:47,936 --> 00:45:48,991
So...

504
00:45:49,764 --> 00:45:52,702
Today is this
megababe's birthday.

505
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:58,754
Happy birthday.

506
00:46:01,824 --> 00:46:02,933
You know,

507
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:05,785
if she were still here today,

508
00:46:05,855 --> 00:46:08,551
a hundred percent, she'd
be making us all her...

509
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,465
Come in!

510
00:46:18,097 --> 00:46:19,683
Hey, sweetheart, um...

511
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:24,910
I... I...

512
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,355
forgot to say earlier...

513
00:46:28,527 --> 00:46:29,738
um...

514
00:46:34,254 --> 00:46:35,394
It's uh...

515
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:36,715
Yeah, it's...

516
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:37,941
Tuesday.

517
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,426
So, <i>The Voice</i>, um...

518
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,840
elimination round.

519
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:48,066
Yeah, of course.

520
00:46:48,136 --> 00:46:49,074
We're still on?

521
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:50,056
Yeah.

522
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:51,449
Meghan's gonna get cut.

523
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:54,144
Yeah, she is. I'll see you...

524
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,207
Bye.

525
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:56,152
downstairs.

526
00:47:18,941 --> 00:47:21,019
<i>I'm sorry, David,
it's another dead end.</i>

527
00:47:23,152 --> 00:47:25,011
You sure you looked
into every one of them?

528
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:26,152
Every one.

529
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:28,566
None of the YouCast users
Margot interacted with

530
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:30,488
have a connection to
her disappearance.

531
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:32,418
- Even f...
- Even fish_n_chips.

532
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:34,888
Using the information
on her account,

533
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:37,255
we traced her
to a Kerchick's Diner

534
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,396
10 miles outside Pittsburgh.

535
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,872
I spoke to her and her manager

536
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:45,693
who confirmed with CCTV
that she was on a shift.

537
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:47,786
Checks out.

538
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,826
I didn't know her.

539
00:47:59,802 --> 00:48:01,474
I didn't know my daughter.

540
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,161
Couple of years ago,

541
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:15,779
an angry neighbor starts
banging on my door.

542
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:18,536
When I asked her what the
trouble was, she said,

543
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,630
she wanted the $25

544
00:48:20,693 --> 00:48:22,544
that my son
had stolen from her.

545
00:48:22,982 --> 00:48:24,833
Now, I didn't know
what she was talkin' about.

546
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:26,701
I know my son.

547
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:29,419
And that did not sound
like the Robert I raised.

548
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:32,335
But as it turned out,

549
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,640
it was true.

550
00:48:34,423 --> 00:48:36,626
My son had

551
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:39,282
gone house to house
in the neighborhood

552
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:42,618
for two weeks telling people
that he was my son.

553
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,274
And that he was
raising money for a

554
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:48,149
fictional

555
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:49,868
police charity called

556
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,415
Moms and Dads in Blue.

557
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:52,813
Mmm.

558
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:55,995
Point is...

559
00:48:57,557 --> 00:48:59,800
you don't always know your kid.

560
00:49:02,303 --> 00:49:05,155
And that is never
your fault.

561
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,871
I have NCIC searching for
the vehicle in 16 states.

562
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:14,028
Let's both try and catch up
on some sleep tonight.

563
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,374
Talk in the a.m.

564
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:17,030
What'd you do after?

565
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:20,638
With your son,
once you found out?

566
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:26,731
Um, I told my neighbor that

567
00:49:27,302 --> 00:49:29,333
I had, in fact,

568
00:49:29,505 --> 00:49:31,973
founded the charity and I
thanked her for the money.

569
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:37,493
But I will deny it
if you ever bring that up.

570
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:38,954
Okay.

571
00:49:42,172 --> 00:49:43,954
Look, I hope you know
how thankful I am

572
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:45,696
that you were assigned to us.

573
00:49:47,782 --> 00:49:50,735
I just wish there wasn't a case
to be assigned to.

574
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:55,923
Alright, shutting down.

575
00:49:56,056 --> 00:49:57,368
- Yeah.
- Talk soon.

576
00:50:45,634 --> 00:50:46,821
This is it.

577
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:51,618
Best place in the world
to do nothing.

578
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,375
This is it.

579
00:52:08,565 --> 00:52:10,800
<i>You've reached Detective
Sergeant Rosemary Vick.</i>

580
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:12,300
<i>Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.</i>

581
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,268
<i>Vick! Wake up.</i>

582
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,354
<i>I know why she was at
that intersection.</i>

583
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:17,776
<i>She wasn't leaving town,</i>

584
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,994
<i>she was driving to the
spot she's been visiting</i>

585
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,276
<i>for the past five months.</i>

586
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:23,417
<i>It's 3:45 a.m.</i>

587
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:24,761
<i>I'm headed there now.</i>

588
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:35,116
Hey!

589
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:36,921
Where are you?

590
00:52:38,585 --> 00:52:40,147
You told me
she ran away, Vick.

591
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:41,147
Are...

592
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,905
Are you at the lake?

593
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:44,749
You told me

594
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:46,553
she ran away.

595
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,311
Okay, I'm heading there
right now.

596
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,241
Robert, honey,

597
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:51,905
just go back to sleep, okay?

598
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:54,802
Okay. I need you
to stay calm, all right?

599
00:52:54,884 --> 00:52:57,040
We're gonna
figure this out together.

600
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:01,735
What are you showing me?

601
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:05,118
This is her keychain.

602
00:53:06,899 --> 00:53:07,923
Oh, my God.

603
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:12,821
Did you call the cops?

604
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:16,212
I'm heading, I'm-I'm
on my way.

605
00:53:17,438 --> 00:53:19,626
You told me
she ran away, Vick!

606
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:25,548
<i>Good morning, Bay Area.
I'm Natalie Boyd.</i>

607
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,517
<i>A terrifying development today</i>

608
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:31,010
<i>as a vehicle matching that of
a missing San Jose teenager</i>

609
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:34,743
<i>was discovered late last night
underneath a Santa Cruz lake.</i>

610
00:53:35,142 --> 00:53:37,110
<i>An operation is
currently underway</i>

611
00:53:37,135 --> 00:53:39,728
<i>to recover Margot Kim's
Toyota Camry.</i>

612
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,009
<i>But at this moment,
we still don't know</i>

613
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:43,962
<i>whether the
Evercreek High sophomore</i>

614
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,712
<i>is actually inside the vehicle.</i>

615
00:54:03,649 --> 00:54:05,461
<i>Okay. It doesn't look like</i>

616
00:54:05,486 --> 00:54:08,110
<i>there's anyone
at the front seat.</i>

617
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,532
<i>Oh, and uh,
now it looks like they're...</i>

618
00:54:14,602 --> 00:54:16,017
<i>okay, they're checking the trunk.</i>

619
00:54:32,474 --> 00:54:33,489
Good morning.

620
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:35,137
Thank you for being here
on such short notice.

621
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:37,417
I am Detective Sergeant
Rosemary Vick,

622
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:39,050
lead investigator on this case.

623
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,075
I am joined by David Kim.

624
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,638
Margot's father.

625
00:54:43,043 --> 00:54:45,614
We've provided you all
with a timeline of events,

626
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:48,458
starting with last Thursday,
May 11th,

627
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,489
when Margot first went missing.

628
00:54:50,552 --> 00:54:52,020
That is yours to circulate.

629
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:54,817
But focusing on the
events of this morning,

630
00:54:54,966 --> 00:54:58,216
The Silicon Valley Police
Department was able to recover

631
00:54:58,241 --> 00:54:59,450
Ms. Kim's vehicle.

632
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:01,138
And to answer the most
pressing question,

633
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:04,060
Margot Kim was not inside.

634
00:55:05,185 --> 00:55:06,216
However,

635
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,800
our examination of the
vehicle did reveal

636
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:10,185
a small amount of blood

637
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:12,880
on the passenger side
dashboard.

638
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:14,544
Blood that points to

639
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:16,630
a physical altercation.

640
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:18,114
Meaning that

641
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:20,982
this case is now officially
being considered

642
00:55:21,357 --> 00:55:22,513
an abduction.

643
00:55:24,482 --> 00:55:25,521
Good afternoon.

644
00:55:25,546 --> 00:55:27,614
A search through the
Santa Cruz forest

645
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:29,536
is now underway
for a local teen

646
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:31,974
whose car was found
dumped in a lake.

647
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,536
<i>Authorities are asking
anyone with information</i>

648
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:37,661
to please call the hotline
or 911 immediately.

649
00:55:37,686 --> 00:55:39,247
<i>Starting at 1:00 p.m.,</i>

650
00:55:39,325 --> 00:55:42,317
<i>we'll be assigning every
volunteer to a search team</i>

651
00:55:42,427 --> 00:55:45,114
<i>Each team is in charge
of a single section</i>

652
00:55:45,145 --> 00:55:47,497
<i>of the critical
12-square-mile radius.</i>

653
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:51,552
Because of the steep ravines
and otherwise unsafe topography

654
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:54,919
on the west side of the lake,
we have already cleared

655
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,357
the following zones.

656
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,184
But still, there's
a lot of ground to cover.

657
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:04,380
Margot!

658
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:08,521
Margot!

659
00:56:10,989 --> 00:56:13,396
<i>It's been four days since
Margot Kim was last seen.</i>

660
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,714
<i>And so far, nothing
to show for it</i>

661
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:18,979
except for the torturous
mystery at its center.

662
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:25,120
<i>$2,500 in cash was found
in a Manila envelope</i>

663
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:26,901
<i>on Margot's passenger seat.</i>

664
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:29,112
<i>Was it a runaway fund?</i>

665
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:31,299
Like the lead detective
is suggesting,

666
00:56:31,753 --> 00:56:33,495
or was it something more?

667
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,003
<i>We covered about um...</i>

668
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:39,089
<i>half the search zone already.</i>

669
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:43,120
<i>And um, tomorrow is
a full day.</i>

670
00:56:43,222 --> 00:56:46,636
And the more people came,
the, the faster it went.

671
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:49,956
Um, could I...

672
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:52,542
So, if you have
some time tomorrow,

673
00:56:52,706 --> 00:56:53,988
uh, we would...

674
00:56:54,613 --> 00:56:55,925
love the help.

675
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,742
<i>This is obviously not
the outcome we wanted.</i>

676
00:57:05,828 --> 00:57:07,842
<i>But we will resume the search</i>

677
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:10,711
<i>the moment it is safe to walk
through the forest again.</i>

678
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:13,031
In the meantime, however,

679
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:15,828
the investigation will not stop

680
00:57:16,523 --> 00:57:18,086
until we find Margot.

681
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:32,430
I mean, listen,

682
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:34,868
I do not think it is my
place to say anything,

683
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:36,049
I just...

684
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,602
I feel that these problems
usually start in the household.

685
00:57:55,966 --> 00:57:57,068
<i>She was...</i>

686
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,489
I'm sorry.

687
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:04,083
She was my best friend.

688
00:58:10,927 --> 00:58:13,583
I'm just a big believer
in community service.

689
00:58:13,802 --> 00:58:16,052
Looking at all the things
that happened to Margot,

690
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,568
I just thought to myself,

691
00:58:17,685 --> 00:58:19,271
"I think they could use my help."

692
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:14,998
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

693
00:59:16,837 --> 00:59:19,376
<i>You can't assist an
investigation anymore.</i>

694
00:59:20,985 --> 00:59:21,961
What?

695
00:59:22,204 --> 00:59:23,524
What does that-
what does that mean?

696
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:25,305
It means that we
can't have someone

697
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:28,032
this close to the case
helping investigate it.

698
00:59:28,212 --> 00:59:29,220
It's my fault

699
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,345
for getting you involved
in the first place.

700
00:59:31,626 --> 00:59:32,829
I did it because

701
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:34,758
we had already lost
so much time.

702
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,681
You're cutting me off?

703
00:59:35,743 --> 00:59:39,900
Every professional who should
be working on this case

704
00:59:40,096 --> 00:59:41,650
is working on this case.

705
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:44,337
All I'm trying to do is
to help you find my daughter!

706
00:59:44,392 --> 00:59:47,150
I know, but you can't
see things clearly.

707
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:50,378
Who's the one who
brought you to the car?

708
00:59:50,658 --> 00:59:52,564
Who's the one
who found the lake

709
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,853
and brought you to the car?

710
00:59:53,932 --> 00:59:56,544
If it wasn't for me,
not you,

711
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:58,944
you and I would be thinking
that my Margot ran away.

712
00:59:58,969 --> 00:59:59,981
But because of me...

713
01:00:00,006 --> 01:00:01,568
We don't know that
she didn't run away.

714
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:04,584
She had cash in her car.

715
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:06,349
But what we do know

716
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:09,422
is that a 17-year-old boy
is in the hospital...

717
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,426
- He's gonna be fine.
- You broke his jaw!

718
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:13,029
- Mom?
- Robert! What...?

719
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,467
Sweetheart, let me
take care of this, please.

720
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,232
If you have a suspicion
about someone, that's fine.

721
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,536
But then, it is the police's job

722
01:00:36,114 --> 01:00:37,513
to look for proof.

723
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:38,903
Not yours

724
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:41,427
to act on flakes of evidence.

725
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,810
Okay, I shouldn't
have done that.

726
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:51,942
From now on,
just tell me what you need.

727
01:00:52,122 --> 01:00:53,903
We need nothing from you.

728
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:57,302
I'm going back to the field.

729
01:00:57,372 --> 01:01:00,114
Do not call me
until I call you.

730
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:02,388
- Vick, please... Vick?
- Get some sleep,

731
01:01:02,513 --> 01:01:03,583
Mr. Kim.

732
01:01:14,352 --> 01:01:16,540
<i>Don't lie to me.
Don't walk away from me.</i>

733
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:34,938
Oh, shit.

734
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:38,157
Guys, stop!

735
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:39,782
Hey! Hey, stop!

736
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,180
Shit!

737
01:01:42,962 --> 01:01:43,993
Get off!

738
01:02:47,781 --> 01:02:50,265
Has anyone even considered
the possibility

739
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:52,476
that it was an
absolute stranger?

740
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:54,656
Some sick perv

741
01:02:54,718 --> 01:02:57,053
in the middle of the woods,
sees a little girl...

742
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,316
Looking for somethin' to drink?

743
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:44,035
- Yeah.
- Coffee?

744
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:45,941
Yeah, coffee would
be awesome, thanks.

745
01:05:49,865 --> 01:05:51,482
No. You know what?

746
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:52,772
You've been probably
straight chuggin'

747
01:05:52,797 --> 01:05:54,093
caffeine the last three days.

748
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:57,843
I am going to make you
some tea.

749
01:05:58,936 --> 01:05:59,991
Herbal.

750
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:03,444
Um, I-I gotta go to my
car for a minute.

751
01:06:03,499 --> 01:06:04,983
I'll be right back, man.

752
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:00,412
Mm.

753
01:07:01,694 --> 01:07:02,959
How's the detective?

754
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,803
She working on any new leads?

755
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:10,006
No.

756
01:07:10,272 --> 01:07:11,506
She's not.

757
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:25,727
What was your relationship
like with Margot?

758
01:07:28,032 --> 01:07:29,079
What do you mean?

759
01:07:29,423 --> 01:07:30,821
You guys hung out, right?

760
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:34,274
Sure.

761
01:07:36,563 --> 01:07:38,110
You know, it was uh...

762
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:42,899
You know, we didn't
hang out a bunch but

763
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:46,336
You know, it's just...

764
01:07:46,484 --> 01:07:48,250
When's the last time
you saw her, by the way?

765
01:07:51,494 --> 01:07:53,344
Pfoo... Um...

766
01:07:54,276 --> 01:07:55,831
You know, I'd have to think...

767
01:07:58,432 --> 01:07:59,643
I think this needs some honey.

768
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:11,969
Who was that?

769
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:14,601
Work.

770
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:17,461
Oh, yeah, uh...

771
01:08:18,289 --> 01:08:19,890
What have they been saying
to you this whole time?

772
01:08:19,915 --> 01:08:21,172
Going back to the
previous question,

773
01:08:21,211 --> 01:08:22,726
when's the last
time you saw her?

774
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:26,054
Dude...

775
01:08:26,578 --> 01:08:28,226
I can barely remember.

776
01:08:29,195 --> 01:08:30,734
But you know what?
L-Let's...

777
01:08:30,788 --> 01:08:32,992
Let's get our minds off
this for a sec, huh?

778
01:08:33,523 --> 01:08:34,866
I feel like...

779
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:37,351
we're just gonna drive each
other crazy talking about it.

780
01:08:37,992 --> 01:08:39,445
Hey, is your tea okay?

781
01:08:40,008 --> 01:08:41,422
Still want that coffee?

782
01:08:41,672 --> 01:08:43,273
"Last night was fun."

783
01:08:43,343 --> 01:08:44,444
What's that?

784
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:52,712
"I feel so weird doing this."

785
01:08:55,204 --> 01:08:56,962
"Don't tell your father."

786
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:00,751
"He'd kill me."

787
01:09:01,751 --> 01:09:03,618
"Seriously, he'd murder me."

788
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,626
And at seven different times...

789
01:09:08,251 --> 01:09:09,751
"See you tonight."

790
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:13,321
What'd you do to my daughter?

791
01:09:16,845 --> 01:09:18,938
What'd you do to my daughter?

792
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,790
I can explain, all right?

793
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:26,493
But you know what?

794
01:09:26,555 --> 01:09:28,711
Let's calm down.
Let's grab a seat.

795
01:09:29,993 --> 01:09:30,899
Please...

796
01:09:31,321 --> 01:09:32,384
Stop.

797
01:09:34,923 --> 01:09:36,071
What'd you do to her?!

798
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:37,626
- Please!
- What'd you do to her?!

799
01:09:37,868 --> 01:09:39,188
What'd you do to her?!

800
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:41,368
What were you doing with her?!

801
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,181
Weed!

802
01:09:53,096 --> 01:09:54,073
What?

803
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,354
Weed!

804
01:09:58,089 --> 01:10:00,238
I was smoking her out.

805
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:19,683
When you guys all came
back from New Year's.

806
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,300
She found my piece.

807
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:25,933
She wanted to try it and...

808
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:27,994
It just kept happening.

809
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:30,355
You gave drugs to my daughter?

810
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:33,370
I promised her I wouldn't tell.

811
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,323
So she would come to you
in the middle of the night

812
01:10:35,348 --> 01:10:37,613
and you would give her weed
and do God knows what else?!

813
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:39,058
That's it.

814
01:10:40,144 --> 01:10:42,698
We'd get high and talk.
I swear!

815
01:10:44,027 --> 01:10:45,167
Okay.

816
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,370
I know how wrong
all this sounds.

817
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,925
I know I should've
told you sooner, but...

818
01:10:50,589 --> 01:10:53,557
Look, I-I didn't think it had
anything to do with this.

819
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:57,112
What kind of a brother are you?

820
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:01,372
You're asking me?

821
01:11:03,824 --> 01:11:05,379
You come in here,

822
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:07,707
and accuse me of something
un-fucking-speakable

823
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:09,988
and you're wondering
what kind of family I am?!

824
01:11:12,285 --> 01:11:13,863
You wanna know why

825
01:11:13,973 --> 01:11:16,144
she hated all those
piano lessons?

826
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:19,762
It's because every
time she would walk in,

827
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,316
she would see that thing

828
01:11:21,341 --> 01:11:23,113
and she would think
about her mother.

829
01:11:24,808 --> 01:11:26,144
She told you that.

830
01:11:28,965 --> 01:11:31,168
She told you that
and not me. Why?

831
01:11:31,308 --> 01:11:34,551
Because you never asked.

832
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:37,002
Ever since Pam,

833
01:11:37,065 --> 01:11:39,222
you stopped talking to Margot
about the only thing

834
01:11:39,255 --> 01:11:42,004
that's been on her mind
the last two years.

835
01:11:44,305 --> 01:11:46,485
She needed you to talk to her.

836
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,516
Not the other way around.

837
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:06,523
I just thought
it would fix itself.

838
01:12:45,476 --> 01:12:46,554
Davey?

839
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:50,945
David?

840
01:12:50,984 --> 01:12:52,546
Oh, God...

841
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,054
This is Eyewitness News.

842
01:13:00,288 --> 01:13:02,632
With live breaking news.

843
01:13:03,522 --> 01:13:05,303
Good morning,
I'm Faustine Rhee.

844
01:13:05,335 --> 01:13:06,671
A parent's worst nightmare

845
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:09,038
comes true this morning
for David Kim.

846
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,905
In a shocking and
thoroughly mind-boggling

847
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:13,711
conclusion to a story that's
captivated the Bay Area,

848
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:16,741
Margot Kim, missing
now for five days,

849
01:13:16,797 --> 01:13:19,977
has just been tragically
declared dead.

850
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:21,039
Why?

851
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:22,727
A taped confession.

852
01:13:22,813 --> 01:13:25,618
Randy Cartoff, released
just six years ago

853
01:13:25,643 --> 01:13:28,516
for felony drug possession
and sexual assault

854
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,655
uploaded the confession online

855
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,766
before taking his own life.

856
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,359
We're going to show you

857
01:13:34,422 --> 01:13:36,594
a segment of the
three-minute video now,

858
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:38,110
but please be warned,

859
01:13:38,172 --> 01:13:40,336
the following contains
graphic descriptions

860
01:13:40,383 --> 01:13:42,188
and disturbing content.

861
01:13:42,258 --> 01:13:44,633
Viewer discretion is advised.

862
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:50,015
Dear girl in the green car,

863
01:13:50,555 --> 01:13:52,313
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

864
01:13:53,203 --> 01:13:56,368
I'm sorry for not listening to
you when you begged me to stop.

865
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,274
I'm sorry for beating you.

866
01:14:01,071 --> 01:14:02,446
And crushing you.

867
01:14:03,016 --> 01:14:04,828
And tossing you
with your suitcases

868
01:14:04,914 --> 01:14:06,500
so no one would ever find you.

869
01:14:09,422 --> 01:14:12,024
I thought this would be easy
but it isn't.

870
01:14:16,407 --> 01:14:18,453
When we arrived at his
Morgan Hill residence,

871
01:14:18,478 --> 01:14:20,219
Mr. Cartoff was deceased.

872
01:14:20,297 --> 01:14:22,789
Seemingly by a
self-inflicted gun wound.

873
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:25,563
Sometimes, these
confessions are hoaxes

874
01:14:25,588 --> 01:14:28,265
but based on his story,
we were able to return

875
01:14:28,312 --> 01:14:31,266
to the lake site where
we discovered trace DNA

876
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:33,762
matching that of Mr. Cartoff

877
01:14:33,856 --> 01:14:37,177
in critical areas
of the search zone.

878
01:14:38,317 --> 01:14:40,825
I've already spoken
to her father.

879
01:14:41,528 --> 01:14:43,270
But at this point
in the investigation,

880
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,552
we are very confident

881
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:49,372
that Ms. Kim's life was taken

882
01:14:49,684 --> 01:14:51,716
on her way out of town.

883
01:14:51,817 --> 01:14:53,723
<i>A private vigil will
be held for Ms. Kim</i>

884
01:14:53,825 --> 01:14:56,294
<i>in downtown San Jose
this week...</i>

885
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:05,456
Still doesn't make sense.

886
01:15:08,151 --> 01:15:09,659
Where's the car that
he took her in?

887
01:15:09,684 --> 01:15:12,276
Where's the... suitcases?

888
01:15:12,972 --> 01:15:14,870
Did-Did he clean up the blood?

889
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:17,511
Vick, who is this guy?

890
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,292
I don't know.

891
01:15:19,433 --> 01:15:21,206
I wish I had an answer.

892
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:23,909
All I know

893
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:25,659
and all you need to know

894
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:29,166
is that this had nothing
to do with you.

895
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:34,915
I guess it don't.

896
01:15:44,393 --> 01:15:47,627
I am so sorry for everything
that happened to your daughter.

897
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:51,064
And I'm so sorry for everything
that happened to you.

898
01:15:52,986 --> 01:15:55,158
And if there's anything
I can do for you,

899
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,298
please do not hesitate
to call.

900
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:05,665
- Okay.
- Okay.

901
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,684
- Get all the water out.
- Are these ready?

902
01:17:22,122 --> 01:17:23,660
Go wake up Daddy.

903
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:29,161
Wake up, Daddy! Wake up!

904
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:30,778
Wake up!

905
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,551
Wake up!

906
01:17:33,622 --> 01:17:35,926
Margot, show Daddy what
you made in school.

907
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:46,926
That's my...

908
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:19,800
I'm Margot.

909
01:20:12,925 --> 01:20:13,784
<i>Hello?</i>

910
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,597
<i>Hi, I'm wondering if I
could speak to Hannah?</i>

911
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,620
<i>Speaking.</i>

912
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:19,588
<i>Hi, I'm calling in regards
to my daughter, Margot Kim.</i>

913
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:21,909
<i>You spoke to her online
as 'mkmania'.</i>

914
01:20:21,941 --> 01:20:24,136
<i>Oh, um, you must have
the wrong number.</i>

915
01:20:24,161 --> 01:20:26,105
<i>I'm talent, not representation.</i>

916
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:27,917
<i>But I can connect you to
my agent, if you like.</i>

917
01:20:27,942 --> 01:20:30,372
<i>So, you work as a waitress
part time then?</i>

918
01:20:30,411 --> 01:20:33,214
<i>Because you told the detective you
were on a shift when she called.</i>

919
01:20:33,316 --> 01:20:35,097
<i>Uh, what detective?</i>

920
01:20:35,284 --> 01:20:36,253
<i>I don't understand.</i>

921
01:20:36,323 --> 01:20:39,034
<i>Detective Vick, she
called you four days ago,</i>

922
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:40,392
<i>and you told her
you were on a shift...</i>

923
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:42,800
<i>Sir, I never got a
call from the police.</i>

924
01:20:42,825 --> 01:20:44,128
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

925
01:20:44,308 --> 01:20:45,988
<i>Maybe I'm not being clear.</i>

926
01:20:46,073 --> 01:20:47,407
<i>On YouCast,</i>

927
01:20:47,432 --> 01:20:49,479
<i>you've been chatting
with my daughter</i>

928
01:20:49,504 --> 01:20:50,519
<i>for months.</i>

929
01:20:50,558 --> 01:20:52,964
<i>Your user name
is 'fish_n_chips'.</i>

930
01:20:53,027 --> 01:20:55,120
<i>Your mother was in the hospital.</i>

931
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,003
<i>Right?</i>

932
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:01,356
<i>What's youcast?</i>

933
01:21:07,222 --> 01:21:09,267
<i>You've reached Detective
Sergeant Rosemary Vick.</i>

934
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:10,995
<i>Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.</i>

935
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:12,566
Vick...

936
01:21:12,652 --> 01:21:14,573
This is David Kim.
Something doesn't add up.

937
01:21:14,598 --> 01:21:16,448
Call me back as soon
as you get this, okay?

938
01:21:24,558 --> 01:21:25,577
<i>SVPD.</i>

939
01:21:25,602 --> 01:21:28,265
Hi, yes, this is an emergency.
I need to speak to

940
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,679
Detective Rosemary Vick.
Can you connect me, please?

941
01:21:30,704 --> 01:21:32,773
<i>- I'm sorry, sir, that's not possible.</i>
- No.

942
01:21:32,798 --> 01:21:34,226
<i>- Uh, what is this regarding?</i>
- Um...

943
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:37,380
This is David Kim, I need to speak
to Detective Rosemary Vick.

944
01:21:37,405 --> 01:21:39,077
<i>Oh, Mr. Kim.</i>

945
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,703
<i>I am so sorry
to hear about Margot.</i>

946
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:44,015
<i>We are all so torn up
about it here.</i>

947
01:21:44,062 --> 01:21:45,023
Yeah, thank you.

948
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:46,250
<i>Especially Rosemary.</i>

949
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:48,421
<i>I have never seen someone
so invested in a case.</i>

950
01:21:48,461 --> 01:21:49,396
Yeah, I know.

951
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:51,015
<i>From the moment she
volunteered to lead it,</i>

952
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,101
<i>- to the way she handled</i>
- Wait.

953
01:21:52,126 --> 01:21:53,140
<i>the investigation.</i>

954
01:21:53,165 --> 01:21:54,836
<i>And really dealt with the media.</i>

955
01:21:54,907 --> 01:21:57,806
Hey, w-w-wait, she did...

956
01:21:58,673 --> 01:22:00,470
Did you say volunteered?

957
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:01,860
<i>Sorry?</i>

958
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:04,579
Y-Y-You said she volunteered.

959
01:22:04,681 --> 01:22:07,313
Did, no, I-I was
led to believe that she...

960
01:22:07,407 --> 01:22:10,180
she was assigned to the case, right?
She was assigned?

961
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:13,282
<i>No. She definitely volunteered.</i>

962
01:22:17,915 --> 01:22:19,524
<i>Unfortunately though, I,</i>

963
01:22:19,712 --> 01:22:21,946
<i>I still can't patch
you through dispatch.</i>

964
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:25,524
<i>She's probably on her way
to Margot's vigil, though.</i>

965
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:31,803
<i>If you'd like, I can connect you
to her work voicemail instead.</i>

966
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:43,337
<i>Mr. Kim?</i>

967
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,430
<i>Mr. Kim?</i>

968
01:23:08,407 --> 01:23:10,227
Actually, can you...

969
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:12,782
connect me to the
deputy sheriff, please?

970
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:18,274
Ms. Vick, as your
counsel was informed,

971
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:20,899
by signing this document,
you hereby verify

972
01:26:20,924 --> 01:26:22,532
the confession you provide today

973
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:24,446
pertaining to the crimes
you're accused of

974
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,814
after your arrest one week ago.

975
01:26:27,329 --> 01:26:28,907
The DA's office
will then consider

976
01:26:28,932 --> 01:26:31,579
leniency in any charges
related to the case.

977
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:34,618
Including first-degree murder.

978
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:39,681
<i>Excuse us, we're taking you now
to San Jose, California,</i>

979
01:26:39,706 --> 01:26:41,243
<i>where we're getting
word now that</i>

980
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:45,189
<i>a law enforcement officer
has just been taken into custody</i>

981
01:26:45,235 --> 01:26:46,874
<i>at the vigil for a local teen</i>

982
01:26:46,899 --> 01:26:48,829
<i>who's been missing
since last Thursday.</i>

983
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:54,556
<i>Let's start with
Thursday, May 11th,</i>

984
01:26:54,728 --> 01:26:56,478
<i>when Margot Kim went missing.</i>

985
01:26:57,056 --> 01:26:58,470
What happened that night?

986
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:00,624
I got a phone call.

987
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:02,212
And who was calling?

988
01:27:04,423 --> 01:27:05,626
My son.

989
01:27:08,649 --> 01:27:09,751
<i>Mom...</i>

990
01:27:09,985 --> 01:27:11,774
<i>I made a big mistake.</i>

991
01:27:11,931 --> 01:27:14,243
<i>I think I, I need to call 911.</i>

992
01:27:14,306 --> 01:27:15,899
<i>What did you do
after hearing the call?</i>

993
01:27:15,946 --> 01:27:17,204
<i>I met him.</i>

994
01:27:17,837 --> 01:27:18,821
<i>Where?</i>

995
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:20,290
<i>Near Barbosa Lake.</i>

996
01:27:20,376 --> 01:27:22,110
<i>He was standing on the
edge of a ravine.</i>

997
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,267
<i>What did Robert tell you
when you got there?</i>

998
01:27:25,797 --> 01:27:27,523
He said, "There's a
girl down there."

999
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:29,782
"I accidentally pushed
a girl down there."

1000
01:27:30,314 --> 01:27:31,462
I asked him why.

1001
01:27:31,532 --> 01:27:32,790
What did he say?

1002
01:27:32,993 --> 01:27:34,024
You need to understand

1003
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:35,907
that my son
is not like other kids.

1004
01:27:35,954 --> 01:27:37,704
He's different.
He can be hurt...

1005
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:39,915
What did he say?

1006
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:45,211
<i>Six months ago, Robert
recognized Margot</i>

1007
01:27:45,235 --> 01:27:47,165
<i>on a live blogging website.</i>

1008
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,118
<i>He'd liked her
since grade school.</i>

1009
01:27:59,087 --> 01:28:00,774
<i>Knew all about her life.</i>

1010
01:28:05,227 --> 01:28:06,477
<i>Her interests.</i>

1011
01:28:09,939 --> 01:28:11,274
<i>So, what did he do?</i>

1012
01:28:13,696 --> 01:28:15,110
<i>Made up a story.</i>

1013
01:28:16,845 --> 01:28:18,407
<i>A new identity.</i>

1014
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,735
<i>This one, I took at a forest.</i>

1015
01:28:21,118 --> 01:28:22,548
<i>For six months,
they were friends.</i>

1016
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:25,634
You work 25 hours
on top of school?

1017
01:28:27,165 --> 01:28:29,743
<i>It was just role-playing.
It was harmless.</i>

1018
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:33,415
<i>Until the money.</i>

1019
01:28:34,868 --> 01:28:37,212
<i>She found his
user name on Venmo.</i>

1020
01:28:38,032 --> 01:28:41,782
<i>She sent $2,500 to cover
hospital expenses.</i>

1021
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:44,610
<i>Expenses that didn't exist.</i>

1022
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:47,103
<i>She was a good kid.</i>

1023
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:49,798
<i>So he decided to
give her money back.</i>

1024
01:28:50,853 --> 01:28:53,040
He had to come clean.
It was over.

1025
01:28:53,899 --> 01:28:55,767
Why didn't he just
give it to her in school?

1026
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:59,790
Margot could have reacted
the wrong way in public.

1027
01:29:00,384 --> 01:29:02,821
Robert does not like
that kind of attention.

1028
01:29:05,837 --> 01:29:07,204
<i>So he followed her.</i>

1029
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:09,899
<i>He followed her.</i>

1030
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:12,548
<i>And what was Margot doing</i>

1031
01:29:12,573 --> 01:29:14,126
<i>when your son
arrived at the lake?</i>

1032
01:29:14,235 --> 01:29:16,063
<i>Getting high in her car.</i>

1033
01:29:16,181 --> 01:29:17,290
Then what happened?

1034
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:18,610
He got in.

1035
01:29:18,696 --> 01:29:20,767
She screamed. She hit him.

1036
01:29:20,884 --> 01:29:22,517
Before he could even realize
that he was bleeding,

1037
01:29:22,602 --> 01:29:24,415
she was running,
calling for help.

1038
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,454
But he ran after her.

1039
01:29:25,509 --> 01:29:26,814
<i>It was pitch black.</i>

1040
01:29:31,267 --> 01:29:32,814
<i>He was not trying to hurt her.</i>

1041
01:29:32,892 --> 01:29:34,626
<i>He was trying to explain.</i>

1042
01:29:34,782 --> 01:29:37,884
But she was punching him
and screaming, and he...

1043
01:29:38,001 --> 01:29:39,470
He just, he reacted.

1044
01:29:39,548 --> 01:29:41,314
He-He pushed back.

1045
01:29:42,579 --> 01:29:44,118
And she fell.

1046
01:29:45,431 --> 01:29:46,462
Just...

1047
01:29:47,603 --> 01:29:49,001
Just disappeared.

1048
01:29:51,689 --> 01:29:53,314
So, your son calls you.

1049
01:29:53,556 --> 01:29:55,524
Asked you to help
cover up a murder.

1050
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:57,126
No. No.

1051
01:29:58,001 --> 01:29:59,462
It was my decision.

1052
01:29:59,571 --> 01:30:01,735
<i>Baby, I don't want
you calling anyone.</i>

1053
01:30:01,931 --> 01:30:03,751
<i>Mommy's gonna
take care of everything.</i>

1054
01:30:03,923 --> 01:30:05,532
<i>It was my decision.</i>

1055
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:08,267
<i>Not his.</i>

1056
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:11,251
<i>So, now, you're looking
down a ravine.</i>

1057
01:30:11,587 --> 01:30:13,587
<i>- Did you go down?
- I tried.</i>

1058
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:16,516
But it was narrow, jagged,
impossible without SAR.

1059
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:17,884
So, how did you figure that...

1060
01:30:17,978 --> 01:30:19,204
That she was dead?

1061
01:30:19,274 --> 01:30:20,907
It was narrow, jagged,

1062
01:30:20,932 --> 01:30:23,587
and at least 50 feet
to rock bottom.

1063
01:30:24,407 --> 01:30:26,243
And it was dead quiet.

1064
01:30:27,048 --> 01:30:28,618
So, you helped your son.

1065
01:30:30,469 --> 01:30:32,196
<i>I dumped the car in the lake.</i>

1066
01:30:32,368 --> 01:30:34,392
<i>And took charge
of the investigation.</i>

1067
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:37,524
<i>I convinced David
his daughter ran away.</i>

1068
01:30:38,665 --> 01:30:41,103
<i>Said forensics
had Margot's hard drive.</i>

1069
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:44,290
<i>And told the
law enforcement team</i>

1070
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:47,087
<i>we'd already cleared the zone
I knew her body was in.</i>

1071
01:30:47,571 --> 01:30:49,125
<i>But still, it was
only a matter of time</i>

1072
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:50,813
before they'd found the spot.

1073
01:30:52,063 --> 01:30:54,274
Which is why
I needed a confession.

1074
01:30:56,415 --> 01:30:59,008
It was the only thing
that would make it stop.

1075
01:30:59,774 --> 01:31:02,219
So you drugged up
an ex-con you knew,

1076
01:31:02,313 --> 01:31:03,657
fed him a script.

1077
01:31:06,251 --> 01:31:08,211
Was it really a suicide?

1078
01:31:13,961 --> 01:31:15,524
He's my son.

1079
01:31:19,922 --> 01:31:23,032
<i>Do you know what prison would
do to someone like him?</i>

1080
01:31:29,188 --> 01:31:30,688
He made a mistake.

1081
01:31:37,446 --> 01:31:39,086
<i>For those of you just joining,</i>

1082
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:42,680
<i>we are now following the police
SUV transporting Detective Vick</i>

1083
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:44,274
<i>and the father of Ms. Kim...</i>

1084
01:31:44,352 --> 01:31:46,719
<i>So, after your arrest,
on your way to the station,</i>

1085
01:31:46,797 --> 01:31:48,469
<i>you didn't say
a word to anyone</i>

1086
01:31:48,494 --> 01:31:50,016
<i>until Mr. Kim asked you,</i>

1087
01:31:50,102 --> 01:31:52,149
was his daughter actually dead.

1088
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:53,815
What did you tell him?

1089
01:31:53,924 --> 01:31:56,307
I said even if Margot had
survived the fall she took,

1090
01:31:56,392 --> 01:31:57,634
it wouldn't have mattered.

1091
01:31:57,830 --> 01:32:00,752
She still would've had to live
five days without water.

1092
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,947
And how did David respond?

1093
01:32:03,549 --> 01:32:04,932
<i>The procession is
now approaching...</i>

1094
01:32:04,994 --> 01:32:06,854
<i>He told them
to turn the car around.</i>

1095
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,041
<i>Why?</i>

1096
01:32:11,947 --> 01:32:13,885
<i>He said it had been two days.</i>

1097
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:16,533
<i>And uh, hold on a second...</i>

1098
01:32:16,674 --> 01:32:19,635
<i>She'd only have to live
without water for two days.</i>

1099
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:22,846
<i>And it looks as though
they're making a u-turn...</i>

1100
01:32:23,072 --> 01:32:25,226
<i>There was a storm on Monday.</i>

1101
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:37,319
<i>We are currently
watching live footage</i>

1102
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:38,975
<i>from our affiliates
in the Bay Area</i>

1103
01:32:39,014 --> 01:32:42,202
<i>of a recovery operation for
missing teen, Margot Kim</i>

1104
01:32:42,227 --> 01:32:43,725
<i>who authorities now believe</i>

1105
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:46,288
<i>is at the bottom of this
Northern California ravine.</i>

1106
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:48,186
<i>Presumed dead only hours ago,</i>

1107
01:32:48,249 --> 01:32:51,498
the search for Margot Kim
is revitalized this evening.

1108
01:32:51,545 --> 01:32:54,600
<i>After a suspect in custody
has provided authorities</i>

1109
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:57,061
<i>with Ms. Kim's exact location.</i>

1110
01:32:57,123 --> 01:33:01,202
<i>The only question that remains:
Is Margot still alive?</i>

1111
01:33:01,311 --> 01:33:03,600
Or is it already too late?

1112
01:33:03,686 --> 01:33:05,881
<i>We are continuing to
monitor the ground</i>

1113
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:08,920
<i>as it appears that everyone
is still just waiting</i>

1114
01:33:08,945 --> 01:33:11,022
<i>for any update on
the operation below.</i>

1115
01:33:11,047 --> 01:33:12,874
<i>But hold on, hold on...</i>

1116
01:33:12,913 --> 01:33:14,194
<i>We just getting word now</i>

1117
01:33:14,233 --> 01:33:16,319
<i>that rescue responders
are beginning an ascent.</i>

1118
01:33:16,397 --> 01:33:17,741
<i>Uh, again, for our viewers,</i>

1119
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:19,225
<i>we do not know
what we're about to see</i>

1120
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:20,795
<i>here as we get a peek around...</i>

1121
01:33:20,898 --> 01:33:23,547
<i>And there she is. We are
getting a closer look now</i>

1122
01:33:23,613 --> 01:33:26,504
<i>as two rescue responders are
pulling up what appears to be</i>

1123
01:33:26,582 --> 01:33:30,581
<i>Margot Kim in-in a body basket
to the top of this ravine here...</i>

1124
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:32,199
<i>Again, we just want
to warn our viewers</i>

1125
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:35,137
<i>that we do not know
what state she's in.</i>

1126
01:33:35,207 --> 01:33:37,387
<i>As we get a look at
Margot's father there...</i>

1127
01:33:37,426 --> 01:33:39,707
<i>But they are making their
way up to the top.</i>

1128
01:33:39,738 --> 01:33:41,926
<i>And it looks like responders
have gotten her up.</i>

1129
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:44,332
<i>Again, no word yet
as to her status...</i>

1130
01:33:44,403 --> 01:33:45,723
<i>And there,
you can see her father</i>

1131
01:33:45,748 --> 01:33:47,551
<i>as it appears that
Search and Rescue</i>

1132
01:33:47,576 --> 01:33:50,144
<i>is now preparing to lift
Margot's body basket</i>

1133
01:33:50,169 --> 01:33:52,075
<i>onto a stretcher
they've just prepared.</i>

1134
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,076
<i>Again, this is live footage here</i>

1135
01:33:54,101 --> 01:33:57,482
<i>as Margot Kim, who has been
missing for the last week</i>

1136
01:33:57,523 --> 01:34:00,882
<i>is now being lifted onto...</i>
