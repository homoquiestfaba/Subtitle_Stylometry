1
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,456
That kid right there?
That's me, Ariana Berlin.

2
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,359
Gymnastics is my life.

3
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,495
I've been doing it since I
was three years old and I've

4
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:32,865
never looked back.

5
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,701
That's my best friend Isla.
She and I used to choreograph

6
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:39,004
our future Olympic
routines in our hallways.

7
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,341
What? Normal
kids don't do that?

8
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,977
My coaches always said
that sometimes you have to fall

9
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,046
before you can fly.

10
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:50,382
I fell a lot.
I trained a lot.

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,686
And right now I'm in the
middle of the most important

12
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,424
level ten meet of my life.

13
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,260
Going too fast?
Let me step back.

14
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:06,331
♪ You gotta get up Whoa
You gotta get up ♪

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,234
Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you to UCLA for hosting this

16
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,906
year's level ten regional meet.
The opening heat will begin in

17
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:17,176
fifteen minutes.

18
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:22,247

20
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,061
Good job.

21
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,063
We've got this.

22
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:42,067
No kidding. We're toast.

23
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:47,139
Just breathe.

24
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,876
It's just, if I don't place...

25
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,444
If you don't place you can
just ask to borrow one of his

26
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,114
Olympic medals. What
does he have, like three?

27
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,615
Four, actually.

28
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,718
See, you'll be getting off
easy. Now if I don't qualify, my

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,653
parents will
pep-talk me to death.

30
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:06,725
Oh I'm sure it's tough living
with all their love and support.

31
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:12,798
Forget about your
Dad. Today is about you.

32
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,520
Nervous?

33
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:38,423
Nervous I might kick you into the
foam pit if you ask me that again.

34
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,161
Here, I got you
something for good luck.

35
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,430
Aw. Did you splurge at the
prize machine in the lobby?

36
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:50,502
Yeah, a whole dollar.

37
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:58,710
I love it.

38
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,281
You've got this.

39
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:06,051
Okay, okay! Let's do this.
Hey, ladies! Quit joking around.

40
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,653
The stakes are even higher
than what we thought today.

41
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,154
Why?

42
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,723
If you ever want to go to
UCLA, the woman who holds the

43
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,194
keys to your future is standing
right over there.

44
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,329
That's Valorie Kondos-Field,
head coach of the

45
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:22,401
six-time Champion UCLA
Gymnastics Team.

46
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:26,505

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,756
That was amazing.

50
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:22,794
Thanks.

51
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,201
And Isla scores a 9.85.

52
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,536
You were fantastic.

53
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,474
It was okay. Wasn't perfect.
You'd only be satisfied with

54
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,209
twenty out of ten.

55
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,777
Up next Ariana Berlin.

56
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,779

Ariana Berlin from San Diego.

Ariana scores a

74
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,063
Sweetheart! You put on
quite the show

75
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,932
for the college coaches.

76
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,434
You think they noticed me?

77
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:45,103
Noticed you? Are you kidding
me? Our phone's gonna be ringing

78
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,738
off the hook tomorrow.

79
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,707
Oh we'll know in a few days.
They said they'd have the final

80
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,709
results by Friday.

81
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,179
Hey Ariana. Wow, you
nailed it out there.

82
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,714
Thanks, you did great, too.

83
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,582
You're totally going
to qualify for sure.

84
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,451
The way you stuck that
landing on bars. Wow.

85
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,286
I was jealous.

86
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,088
Don't be. This is just a
Level 10 meet. There's still a

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,023
long way to go.

88
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,525
Could you imagine what
it would be like to make the

89
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,059
Olympics?

90
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,362
It would be so unbelievable,
but I doubt it's something I'll

91
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:13,131
ever get to experience.

92
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,933
Me neither. I
wish I could go.

93
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,135
Come on, you gotta be more
positive. You never know what

94
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,538
life is going to
throw at you, right?

95
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,609
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:29,080
Okay, remember this trip?
That girl who peed her pants on

97
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,216
the bus ride home?

98
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,219
What? We were six and I
had way too much water.

99
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:39,291
Okay. I'm so glad your Dad
let you come over.

100
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,428
How was he about your score?

101
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,399
He said it was acceptable.
But, of course if I don't

102
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,268
qualify for the Olympic
team he'll downgrade it to

103
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,805
"deplorable" or something.

104
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,443
Well don't worry, you'll qualify because
you are the best in the country.

105
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,112
It would be a dream come true.

106
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,850
Yeah, for me it's the
Olympics and then UCLA.

107
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,252
I haven't even started
thinking about college.

108
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:11,323
Well UCLA has an amazing
gymnastics team.

109
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,959
Well you came over to
study so let's get to it.

110
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,161
Nooo

111
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,266
So how late were
you and Isla up?

112
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:25,036
Late. We were trying to
cram for organic chemistry.

113
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,108
A champion gymnast and a
straight 'A' student.

114
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,044
I'm still waiting for this
teenage rebellion

115
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,280
that everyone keeps
telling me is on the horizon.

116
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:38,884
Overachieving is my personal
form of teenage rebellion.

117
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,452
I think I deserve a reward.

118
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,522
Well I have a better idea.
Why don't you come shopping with

119
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,323
me this afternoon?

120
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,125
Aw, do I have to?

121
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,861
I know, it's so awful. I'm
serious, you've been so busy

122
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,499
training, I just think you need a
regular mother-daughter afternoon.

123
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,068
I see right through you, mother!

124
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,403
You're trying to distract me.

125
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,473
And it's working, isn't it?

126
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:15,153
So you're lost in
thought, what's going on?

127
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,187
Nothing.

128
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,091
Uh-huh. Can you
be more specific?

129
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,929
Pierce said one of the
coaches from the

130
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,565
UCLA team was at qualifiers.

131
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,600
Yeah, well honey, you throw
a rock in that stadium you're

132
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,835
pretty much gonna
hit a college coach.

133
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,905
Well don't throw any at UCLA
'cause I want to get in there.

134
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,108
I know you do.
One thing at a time.

135
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,379
Let's just focus on the
shopping today.

136
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,349
What if I don't qualify
for the Olympics?

137
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,519
Would you be upset?

138
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,755
Are you kidding me? Your
father and I are so proud of

139
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,123
you. Olympics or -

140
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:57,162
Mom, watch out!

141
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:05,437
Hey! Hey! Are you okay?
Are you okay?

142
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:24,489
I don't think she's breathing. Go
call an ambulance. Call an ambulance.

143
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:38,097
Try and stay awake for me, okay?
Can you tell me your name, honey?

144
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:45,010
Tell me what happened.
Do you know what date it is?

145
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:58,056
No, she's gone again.

146
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:19,171
Ar, honey. It's okay, I'm
here. I love you so much.

147
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,480
Where?

148
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:27,285
You're in the hospital.
You had an accident.

149
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,654
But-

150
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,157
Don't try to talk, okay?
I'm gonna go get the doctor.

151
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,792
Where's mom?

152
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,694
She's just down the
hall in another room.

153
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,228
I, I need to see her.

154
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,399
No, you need to, you need to
lie down, okay?

155
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:46,471
You've been in a coma, honey. I'm
gonna tell the doctor you're awake.

156
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,313
Both lungs punctured, broken
collar bone, two broken ribs,

157
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:59,084
slight fracture of the right
wrist, injured pancreas, one

158
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:03,154
femur snapped, the other
fractured. Well the good news is

159
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:07,025
she only suffered minor head
trauma, no major concussion.

160
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,760
Neck and spine are in fairly
good shape considering the

161
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:12,664
accident. I would say under the
circumstances, your daughter is

162
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,266
a very lucky girl.

163
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,668
I don't feel very lucky.

164
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,704
The fact that you feel
anything at all is enormous.

165
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,273
We could have lost you,
young lady.

166
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:27,112
Sweetheart, I'm so
happy to see you awake.

167
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,247
When can I get up?

168
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,884
We're looking at nine to ten
weeks for the bone to heal, then

169
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,287
physical therapy for a few
months. Luckily you're an

170
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:40,759
athlete so I think the body
is going to respond quickly.

171
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,027
So I lose four, maybe five
months, and then I can get back

172
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,096
to training, right?

173
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:50,168
Truth is, gymnastics is
pretty much off the table.

174
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,742
Honey, I'm so sorry.

175
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,111
You don't know what you're
talking about! I want another

176
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,546
doctor! This is ridiculous.

177
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,947
Calm down, honey.

178
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,151
I, I can't sit in bed
all day. I have to train.

179
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,385
I'll see you outside.

180
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,388
I need to go to the
Olympics. It's okay.

181
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:41,853
Want a gum? Nope, I'm
good mom. Thanks for asking.

182
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:46,925
No problem, anytime.

183
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,494
Oh...

184
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,628
What?

185
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,366
Nothing.

186
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,869
You know, Isla had a great
floor routine and a perfect

187
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:02,707
vault, but she did take that step
after the dismount from her bars.

188
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,244
And, that's the difference
between Gold and Silver.

189
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,280
Yup.

190
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,381
Somebody's in a mood.

191
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,718
I'm not in a "mood".

192
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,120
You know, you've had your
pictures on the paper, too.

193
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,122
Yes, I know, Mom.
I especially liked the one of me

194
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:23,194
unconscious in the hospital.

195
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,630
You know, you were a lot
more pleasant

196
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,131
when you were unconscious.

197
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,400
Touché.

198
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:33,338
Ariana? Hey, I'll take you
in. My name's Michelle and I'll

199
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,242
be-okay. Uh, are you coming?

200
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:42,080
No, no, no. She's all
yours. Where's Brittany?

201
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,483
She's not here today. I'll be
putting you through the paces.

202
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,886
Aren't you a little young
to be a physical therapist?

203
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,988
I'm a physical therapy
resident, which means I'm in

204
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,090
training to become a P.T.

205
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,893
I was in training
once. Lot of good it did me.

206
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,662
Well let's see if we
can get you back on track.

207
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:02,734

darkness sometimes ♪

208
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,973

211

You know, you could still
compete. I mean maybe not soon,

212
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,734
but if you want something you
have to fight hard for it.

213
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,236
And what if something I
really want is

214
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,804
no longer attainable?

215
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,072
Look, sometimes when the
front door gets slammed in your

216
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,241
face, you have to go
through the back door.

217
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,742
What if there is no back door?

218
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:49,547
Then go through a window.
There's always a way in. Ready?

219
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:55,053
I just need you to just trust
me, okay? One, two, three, up.

220
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:04,495

Yeah.

227
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,155

Alright, so last time we did fifteen
steps, but I think we can beat that.

235
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:59,077
Without holding onto the railing.
It says here

236
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,447
that you should be able to walk
now on your own without help.

237
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,115
It says that?

238
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,551
Yup. It says your body's well
on the road to healing. But your

239
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,187
mind's still broken.

240
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:13,391
It does not say that. They
wouldn't put that in a chart.

241
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,194
Yes they would.
It's even in pen.

242
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,295
Let me see that.

243
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,696
Sorry, professional eyes only.

244
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,898
Well that rules you out,
resident! Give it to me.

245
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,970
No! And you just
did twenty steps.

246
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,949
Nicely done.

247
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,450
My leg is killing me.

248
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,653
Yeah, but for a
minute there you forgot.

249
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,089
Does it really say all
that stuff in my chart?

250
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:50,161
What's a six letter word
for stubborn? A-R-I-A-N-A.

Thank you for helping me
through all this. I owe you one.

Come. You did really good
and you should be very proud of

253
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:11,382

thirty steps tomorrow?

You'll be fine. You're old
teammates have been asking about

00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,105
you. You can't stay
away forever, you know.

260
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,307
Says who?

261
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,276
I better go move the car.
I don't want to get towed.

But wait, mom, I can't-

I'll be right back.

Hey coach.

Hey I'll see you guys in there.

266
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,520
Hey, welcome back, kid.

267
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,291
Great to be here. Are my
uneven bars ready and polished?

268
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,059
Well you know they've been
covered in dust

269
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,996
since you've been gone.
It's great to see you.

270
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:04,402
The gang will be so
excited to see you again.

271
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:30,161
Hey guys, listen
up. Ariana's here.

272
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,770
Hey, stop. Hey, hey, stop,
stop, stop. Where are you going?

273
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,771
You just got here.

274
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,273
I saw enough.

275
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,107
Huh?

276
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,610
Isla and Nate?

277
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,211
Come on, Ariana. It's
not what it looks like. He's

278
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:52,216
probably just congratulating
her for getting into UCLA.

279
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,251
She what?

280
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:57,088
Hey, what's uh, what's going on?

281
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,890
I'll give you guys
a minute. I'm sorry.

282
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,727
This isn't going to work.

283
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,296
What's going on?

284
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:10,368
I just want my life back.

285
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,147
Hey, you better get
ready, you're going out.

286
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:23,981
With who?

287
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:24,982
Michelle.

288
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,550
And you didn't think to tell me?

289
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:27,918
Of course not. That would
have given you more time to say

290
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,819
'No'.

291
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,954
Mom!

292
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,392
Come on, don't
want to disappoint her.

293
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:46,671
Welcome to Palace.

294
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,744
Hey Cashmere.

'Sup brother?

296
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:15,433
I get the feeling we're not
a physical therapy convention.

Where are we?

298
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,038
Girl, for all your whining
and complaining about your

299
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,041
boyfriend and your medals, have
you ever thought to ask me one

300
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,377
question about myself?

301
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,311
Michelle, my babe!

302
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,045
Hey!

303
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,680
Where you been?

304
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,116
Well besides making money to
pay for this place?

305
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,484
Picking up Ariana here.

306
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:36,153
Ah, you're the gymnast. Sorry
about your accident.

307
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,321
How you doing girl?

308
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:38,723
I've been better.

309
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,224
Wow.

310
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,625
Watch where you're wavin'
those on the dance floor, you'll

311
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,228
take someone's eye out.
Actually, there's one or two

312
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,731
guys I wouldn't mind
you wavin' those at.

313
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,299
What?!

314
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:53,304
She's kidding. Emma has
a strange sense of humour.

315
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:56,307
I won't be getting out on the
dance floor. What kind of party

316
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,112
is this, anyway? Is this a rave?
Darling, the '90's ended a

317
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:06,517
long time ago.
This is a session.

So, you post all
those videos online?

351
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,538
Yup. It's a good way to
promote.

352
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,207
We usually get a
few thousand hits.

353
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,709
Wow.

354
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:22,212
That's nothing. My goal is
to get a million hits one day.

355
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:26,016
So you're a champion dancer
who runs a studio, and does

356
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:30,187
physical therapy? And I
thought I was an overachiever.

357
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:35,259
I'm all about that hustle,
baby. So... can you help us?

358
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:39,229
Me? What could I
possibly help you with?

359
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,865
Well, there's this big
talent management company called

360
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:46,937
Crystal Image. They represent
the best of the best. They hold

361
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,440
auditions once a year, and
anyone who gets in with them, is

362
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:53,377
in with the money. Travel around
the world, be on TV, tour with

363
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:58,449
rock stars. You get the picture.
Auditions are coming up soon.

364
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,884
I still don't get what I can do.

365
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,654
Well, they're looking for a
dance crew with edge - some sort

366
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:07,291
of unique special skill, and
I was thinking since you have

367
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,826
Olympic level experience -

368
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,462
Michelle, first-off, I'm
not Olympic level. Second, I've

369
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,732
never danced hip-hop a day in my
life. And third, even if both of

370
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:19,436
those were the case, look at me.
You look to me like you're

371
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:24,508
ready to get moving
again. Think about it.

372
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:41,525
Mom, Dad, I'm
home. Sorry I'm late.

373
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,334
Alright, this little rift
between you guys is hurting

374
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:54,872
everyone, and it's hurting your
recovery. So you're not leaving

375
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:59,910
this room until
everything is settled, okay?

376
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:14,124
Look, I'm sorry about
what you saw earlier today.

377
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,894
I had no right coming
back there unannounced.

378
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:19,329
I know what it looked like.

379
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,532
But I want you to
know that it's nothing.

380
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:25,035
Yeah, you're
right. It is nothing.

381
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:29,139
Listen Ariana. You can get
back on your feet.

382
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,041
You can get into UCLA.

383
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,510
I have a metal rod in my leg.

384
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:34,978
I'd be lucky to hop
up on a beam again.

385
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,382
Well I can help you. Pierce
can help you.

386
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:43,420
Please just come
back to the gym tomorrow.

387
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:56,633
I'm busy with something else.
Yeah? What?

388
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,905
I'll do it.

389
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,741
Do what?

390
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,044
Help out your crew. Teach you
guys some flips

391
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,279
and handsprings and stuff.

392
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:14,251
Really? Wow. Sorry,
Ariana this is Caity.

393
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,552
Hi. Ariana.

394
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,421
Caity.

395
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,223
Caity was a
professional downhill skier.

396
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:23,227
I got in a fight. With a
tree. Been a regular patron of

397
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:26,430
room 404 ever since.

398
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,599
How long is your
recovery schedule?

399
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:33,203
Only another, what, 60 maybe
70 years. If I'm lucky.

400
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,905
Does that sound about right?

401
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:38,709
Caity has come a long
way. A very long way.

402
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:40,310
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,814
No, don't be. You should see
the tree. No, I'm not a patient

404
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:48,152
anymore - I just come to spend time with
others here who are in similar situations.

405
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,587
Caity heads a support group
for families with spinal cord

406
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:51,989
injury patients.

407
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,791
If there is
anything I can do to help-

408
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:58,462
You just stay focused on yourself.
You've got your own hill to climb.

409
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,298
Thanks.

410
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,167
I'll see you next
week, okay? Take care. Bye.

411
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,236
So? You had fun last night?

412
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:11,308
Yes. Thank you for taking me.

413
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:28,725
I dunno, it's taking a while. They're
late probably, right? I don't know.

414
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:33,931
Hey. I got us some help.

415
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,365
Welcome back.

416
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,501
Hold up. Hold up. What do
we need peg-leg's help for?

417
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:41,205
"Peg-leg?" She ain't no dang
pirate! What's wrong with you?

418
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:45,776
I just don't need no gymnast
telling me how to dance.

419
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:49,346
There's a small chance
the speaker may be broken.

420
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:54,418
That's Twist
running up my overhead.

421
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:06,063
And you remember Adam
from the other night?

422
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,170
And of course, Emma.

423
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:18,242
The "Empress" at
your acquaintance.

424
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:29,086
And this fountain of
positivity here is Cashmere.

425
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,495
Eighty percent attitude
and twenty percent high heels.

426
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,264
So, what are you going to
teach us that

427
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,932
we don't already know?

428
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,367
She's going to teach us moves
that we can use in our routine

429
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,669
so that we can get a
contract with C.I.

430
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,272
With some leverage training
and a little less burrito I

431
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:51,108
could help you get seven
or eight feet of air.

432
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,509
Seven or eight feet of air?

433
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,177
Mhm.

434
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,712
Okay.

435
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:58,181
So, you're gonna
teach us leverage?

436
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:02,519
Sounds good to me. I'm always
down to learn something new.

437
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,923
I'll bet you are.

438
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,091
So you going to take those off?

439
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,294
There's two things you need
to know, honey. One. I take off

440
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:15,465
my heels when I'm good and
ready. Two... can someone help

441
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,970
me take off my heels?

442
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:25,042

to get to. Adam, would you mind

460
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,242
closing up?

461
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,009
Sure.

462
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,144
Sweet.

463
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,645
Okay, let's go.

464
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,581
Shoot. I don't think I'll
have time to drive you home.

465
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,184
I can drive her.

466
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:15,218
Okay.

467
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,686
Yeah, no problem.

468
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,989
Yeah. Alright, later guys.

469
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:21,091
Yeah let's just get this
place cleaned up really quick

470
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,359
and then -

471
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:25,328
Dude, actually, I
gotta pick up my sister.

472
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,097
But you don't have a car?

473
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,733
Or a sister.

474
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,902
Okay, gotta go. Bye guys.

475
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,737
Have fun cleaning.

476
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,575
Every time we have to clean up.

477
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,243
Need help?

478
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,846
No, don't worry about it.
Just chill out. This won't take

479
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:47,918
long. So, uhm, what kind of
gymnast are you? Do you jump

480
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,520
around on mats or
swing around on bars?

481
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:55,592
Wow. You know the technical
terms. I've done it all -

482
00:34:56,361 --> 00:35:00,130
balance beam, uneven bars,
vaults. Now I'm just a girl who

483
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,766
used to be a gymnast.

484
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,801
Once a gymnast,
always a gymnast.

485
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:10,273
So, where'd you learn to dance?

486
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,442
I learned to
dance on the streets.

487
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:17,514
Oh, the
streets. Wow. Hard-core.

488
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:22,986
Mostly my backyard
or in the schoolyard.

489
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,222
So how'd you guys
all get together?

490
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:29,092
Well we all went to the
same elementary school. But this

491
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:32,229
whole C.I thing, this is recent.
Michelle's just been laser

492
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:36,099
focused, she wants
to go big time.

493
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:41,138
You guys totally could.
You're honestly amazing.

494
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,476
So, do you have a
boyfriend? Smooth.

495
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:50,780
I mean, I was just wondering
'cause I think Twist thinks

496
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,315
you're really cute.

497
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:57,154
Oh. He's kinda cute.

498
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,157
Okay I think it's time to
take you home because you're

499
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,994
mentally exhausted or
somethin'. Let's go.

500
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,063
What? What are you doing?

501
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,990
So tell me more
about these auditions.

502
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,559
Ever seen "Dance
for the Moment?"

503
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,127
Both the movie and
the Broadway show.

504
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:40,897
Well those are Crystal Image
dancers. Look, if you want to

505
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,800
make it as a dancer, you have to
go pro. And making this audition

506
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:47,504
is the best way to do that.

507
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,339
And what about the clinic?

508
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:52,976
I love it here. But, dance is
my passion and I'd say passion's

509
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:57,147
worth a shot, no?

510
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:59,182
Well you guys need to
gain confidence for acrobatic

511
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:02,319
stability and that's after many
hours on the floor and that's

512
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:05,088
before we even start
with the trampolines.

513
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,191
Trampolines? I'm sorry, what
kind of hours are we talking

514
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,693
here?

515
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,761
Well, for expert-hood they
say ten thousand, but since we

516
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:15,398
don't have that kind of
time... all of them?

517
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,033
Are you crazy?

518
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,401
You just realized that?

519
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,337
Michelle Franklin room
316, Michelle Franklin 316

520
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,673
Look, I gotta run. But,
we'll talk about this later.

521
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:27,210
Practice starts tonight.

522
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:32,282
Remember, ten sits and
stands three times a day.

523
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:39,456
Hey! Look who's ready
to conquer the world.

524
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,092
I'm feeling pretty good.
Michelle's a great motivator.

525
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,860
That she is.

526
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:48,732
Well, it's my last day here today
and I just wanted to say that -

527
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:51,768
This is one place where
goodbyes are a good thing. It's

528
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,304
great when people can leave,
especially on their own two

529
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,072
feet.

530
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,074
There should be gold medals
awarded to inspirational people

531
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,376
like you.

532
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:04,447
What's a medal anyway?

533
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,289
You're gonna be okay.
Go make room 404 proud.

534
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:26,903
Nice Vicki. Work your snap down.
Keep your weight behind you.

535
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,139
Pierce, I need a favour.

536
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,640
Okay?

537
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,275
Can my dance troupe practice
in here during your off hours?

538
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,277
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Since when
do you have a dance troupe?

539
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,413
It's a hip hop group. I'm
just teaching them some flips

540
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:38,915
and stuff.

541
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,851
Okay.

542
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,619
What?

543
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,689
Nothing. It's just..

544
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,525
Spit it out.

545
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:52,829
If you're doing hip hop, why
aren't you doing gymnastics?

546
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,931
And where am I going
to do gymnastics, Pierce?

547
00:38:54,933 --> 00:39:00,003
Same place as Isla. UCLA.

548
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:05,508
You know, I can get you a demo in front
of Coach Val in a couple of weeks.

549
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,277
You really oughta
think about it.

550
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:14,050
So what about
letting us practice in here?

551
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:19,122
Well done, Vicki!
Let's see that again.

552
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,365
Wow.

553
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,301
Okay, so last time we did
this everyone had to hold back.

554
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,336
Now we can all let loose and
not worry about anyone breaking

555
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:40,377
their necks. Okay, so what
do you guys want to do?

556
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,178
I know what I want to do.

557
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,214
Uh, Cashmere, take off those
high heels before you get on

558
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:47,183

Manageable.

603
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:13,910
Normal human manageable,
or Ariana manageable?

604
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:18,081
Well, let's say it's manageable.

605
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,817
Look, I know I mentioned this
to you a few weeks ago,

606
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,020
but UCLA is having
some walk-on demos soon.

607
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,555
I don't know.

608
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:30,159
You should go. Just to try. I
know, you have your dance thing,

609
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:32,862
but come on do you really
want to leave your entire past

610
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:37,934
behind? This is
the date and time.

611
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:50,179
Five, six, seven, eight. One,
two, three, four, five, and six,

612
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:53,349
seven, eight.

613
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:57,186
Aight, everyone take
five. This isn't working.

614
00:45:57,188 --> 00:46:00,022
Ok, the problem is we're too
coordinated. We need to loosen

615
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:02,391
up. Instead of getting together
at this point, let's break off

616
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:05,862
in a freestyle section. Play to
each of your strengths. Twist,

617
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,264
you've come further than anyone
else with the height, you're

618
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,400
going to do a chest lift off of
Adam since he has the strength.

619
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,469
And then Cashmere, aerials
moving forward, Michelle you're

620
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,238
going to run through it all.

621
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,475
Yeah, but we still need
something bigger to close it.

622
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,244
An aerial section?

623
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:24,614
No, that would be good enough
for the Palace, but not for C.I.

624
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,649
We need something bigger.

625
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:30,319
What's the holy grail
of gymnastics, Ariana?

626
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:34,991
The full out. Two flips with
a full twist. Thought impossible

627
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:38,394
until the invention of spring
floors. Even elite gymnasts have

628
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:41,264
a hard time with it. I tried
landing one in practice a few

629
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:45,168
weeks before my accident. Never
had the chance to try it in

630
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,003
competition.

631
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:50,439
You could totally do one now. I
mean you are stronger than ever.

632
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,275
Please. Do you know
how tough it would be

633
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,310
with a rod in my femur?

634
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:59,148
Yeah! Full out, full out,
full out, full out, full out,

635
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:03,186
full out, full out,
full out, full out-

636
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:06,622
Yeah, come on. Do a full out!
Yo, if you're gonna gawk, you

637
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:08,291
gotta pay admission!

638
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:12,595
Hey, what are you guys doing
here? Isn't it a little late?

639
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:15,331
Pierce told us that
you skipped out on UCLA.

640
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,933
I'm good.

641
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:19,135
I didn't think you were
serious about the hip hop thing.

642
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:21,971
I figured it was a
cover story or something.

643
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,140
Well, here it is.

644
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,542
Who's the Swedish bikini model?

645
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:29,312
Isla's one of the top
gymnasts in the world. She just

646
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,514
won a Silver medal.

647
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,983
Ariana, this is ridiculous.
Are you really gonna throw away

648
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:38,020
a chance at college gymnastics
to hangout in alleys making up

649
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,790
dances with low-lifes?

650
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:43,693
We're five of the top ten
ranked artists in the city.

651
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:45,561
Sorry, I guess I wouldn't
know about artists. See, I'm

652
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:48,231
what they call an athlete.

653
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:50,066
Well, that's good.
Considering that you're

654
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:53,302
definitely not a stylist.

655
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,371
Stop taking advantage of
Ariana's fragile state, and let

656
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,139
her come back to
where she belongs.

657
00:47:57,141 --> 00:48:01,477
She belongs wherever she
wants. She's here. So why don't

658
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:05,715
you just do a
little flip outta here.

659
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:10,753

call a lowlife, I might say the

same to you.

690
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,181
That was actually
pretty impressive.

691
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:26,022
Why thank you, your highness.
But you're a gymnast, Ariana.

692
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:32,194
You should be at UCLA with me.

693
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:38,567
It was very nice to meet
ya'll. You're very talented.

694
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:28,244
Ariana Berlin, right? I saw
you compete two years ago. You

695
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:34,356
did well. It's a shame
about the accident.

696
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:36,592
Yeah.

697
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,929
What can I do to help you?

698
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:43,933
I'd like to know, what do I
have to do to become a walk on

699
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,735
at UCLA?

700
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:49,138
You want to walk onto my team?

701
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,773
Yeah.

702
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:53,943
You realize I get paid to
produce the most elite athletes

703
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:55,611
in the country.

704
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,314
I've always been a winner
and I'm ready to win again.

705
00:51:58,316 --> 00:52:01,250
Well I'm sure you are. But
that's not enough. Please don't

706
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:05,154
waste my time.

707
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:09,225
Sorry to have bothered you.

708
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:12,228
Ariana, if you're going to
come back to gymnastics, you

709
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,598
need to come back like
you really mean it.

710
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,733
Ma'am, I'm willing to do
anything and everything to be a

711
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,235
part of this team.

712
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:22,171
Look, I've seen your work
ethic. I know it's good. But can

713
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:25,141
you give me one
hundred percent commitment?

714
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:27,343
Absolutely. A hundred
percent. A hundred and ten

715
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:29,645
percent.

716
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,814
I'll need to see you do a demo.

717
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,817
Sure, yeah.

718
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,419
Right now?

719
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:39,655
Oh, sorry, did you
mean another time?

720
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:44,727
No, if you're
ready, then let's do it.

00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:47,984
Welcome to UCLA. You're sweaty.
Thank you, thank you ma'am.

730
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,659
Thank you so much.

731
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:52,228
Ariana, don't call me ma'am,
sounds old. The other girls call

732
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,196
me Miss Val.

733
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:59,268
Ok ma'am-I mean Miss Val.

734
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:06,508
She's good. She's not great.
It'll be good to have a

735
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:10,346
dancer on the team. The other
girls can learn from her. But

736
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:15,251
she'll never compete.

737
00:54:18,189 --> 00:54:22,258
Gymnastics all day, hip hop
at night. You sure you're not

738
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,860
pushing yourself too hard?

739
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,962
Heck, when I was her age I
used to play football, baseball

740
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:28,597
and basketball.

741
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,232
Not all in one day.

742
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,268
I'll be fine Mom.

743
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,136
Just take it easy young lady.
We don't want to have to put you

744
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,405
back together again.

745
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,073
I'll try to pace myself.

746
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,041
Ohhh.

747
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:39,975
Sure you will.

748
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:45,047
Yeah.

749
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,510
Ariana, are you okay?

750
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:17,446
I'm fine.

751
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,648
Do you want help?

752
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:24,720
No.

753
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:29,191
Why are you so mad at me?

754
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:31,193
I never said I was mad at you.

755
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:39,195
Not in so many words. Mainly 'cause
you don't say anything to me anymore.

756
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:48,510
Why do you keep
shutting me out? Are you okay?

757
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,446
Stop asking me that!

758
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:52,481
Look, I didn't cause your
accident. What was I supposed to

759
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:55,651
do, stop living my life?

760
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,453
I don't want to talk about it.

761
00:55:57,455 --> 00:56:01,056
Look, I wish you were at
the games too. But it is not my

762
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:06,128
fault.

763
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:03,752
She's hit a plateau. It's one
amateur mistake after another.

764
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:07,456
Can you talk to her?
Help her find her focus.

765
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,024
Why me?

766
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,460
Because she'll listen to you.
I think it coming from me it's

767
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:14,029
more pressure.

768
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:19,101
Well Miss Val, Isla and
I don't really talk much.

769
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:24,706
I thought you two were friends?

770
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,309
We kinda fell out.

771
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,912
Well fall back in, Ariana.
This is a gymnastics team and

772
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:34,983
your teammate needs your help.

773
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:41,256
Isla! Wait! Where are you going?
Just to the bus stop. My dad

774
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,059
left without me so...

775
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:45,260
Why?

776
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:49,465
He said he can't even
look at me right now.

777
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,000
Do you want to talk about it?

778
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:57,005
Val set you up for this, didn't
she? I bet you didn't want to.

779
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:02,311
Isla, it was always my dream
to go to the Olympics and win a

780
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:05,647
medal and then go to UCLA
and have lots of fun. But that

781
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:10,719
didn't happen, instead you got
it all. And I guess it's just

782
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:16,358
hard for me to watch
from the sidelines.

783
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,693
Really?

784
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,595
Yeah, really.

785
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:23,265
I thought you were mad at me.
Well I guess I was a bit mad

786
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:26,001
about the whole Nate
thing, but I'm over it.

787
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,637
I'm so sorry about that. I
should have told you the truth

788
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:31,840
but it's over and
it didn't work out.

789
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,676
It's okay. And I'll
still always know that you peed

790
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,713
yourself on that bus.

791
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:42,784
Well, just so you know, the
Olympics weren't all that great.

792
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:44,486
Don't believe the hype.

793
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,021
Are you serious?

794
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,623
No! They were amazing and you
needed to be there. It was so

795
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:51,026
awful that you weren't. I
missed you the whole time.

796
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:54,696
I bet you did? Especially
when you blew that dismount.

797
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,232
Well at least I was there
and not slacking off in some

798
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:58,634
hospital room.

799
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,169
Well at least I
got free pudding!

800
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:04,540
Well, you're getting your
revenge now. I peaked and it's

801
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:08,210
been downhill ever since.

802
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,145
You can break out of it.

803
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,047
Oh I would love to just
forget about gymnastics for a

804
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,751
little while.

805
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:20,756
What?

806
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:32,267
Hey. I haven't seen or heard
from you in weeks. I was about

807
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,236
to bust down your door.

808
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,771
I was sick.

809
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:38,273
There's no time to be sick.
Auditions are twelve days away.

810
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:42,044
Check what we've got it on.

811
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:46,415
They don't know you're back
on the gymnastics team, do they?

812
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:50,285
I just haven't
figured out how to tell them.

813
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,589
Or have you not
figured out what you want?

814
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:58,594
I miss hating you
for knowing me so well.

815
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,697
Hi.

816
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,198
Chill cheese fries?

817
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,233
No, no. I can't.

818
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,868
Sure you can.

819
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:11,873
No seriously. My
coach will kill me.

820
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:16,945
I, I don't see any
coaches around here.

821
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:22,250
Okay but, just,
just a little bit.

822
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:23,652
Okay just a-

823
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,220
Just a small-

824
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:30,092
Just a small-That's pretty
big but yeah go for it. It's

825
01:00:30,094 --> 01:00:32,494
good, just, just
try it. Just try it.

826
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:39,468
Okay. Oh that's good.

827
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:44,272
See, this is what I do. I
bring joy to the people. Want

828
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:47,776
another one?

829
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:48,677

Okay.

831
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,079
Just one.

832
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:56,918
I'm going to take one too.

833
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,053
Really good.

834

01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:25,373
Rest time is as important as
training time. You have got to

848
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,042
give this up.

849
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,777
I know you're upset, but
that's what got me back into

850
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,345
gymnastics.

851
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:32,848
It got you moving again, it
got you motivated. But look at

852
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,350
you, you're tired and
you're burning out.

853
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:37,953
I don't know if you noticed,
but Isla spent one night around

854
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:39,788
that stuff and
she's back on track.

855
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,623
Ariana you've got to start
thinking about what's important

856
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:45,427
to you. And start making the
right choices. You've gotta feel

857
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:49,197
it in here. This is where it
matters the most. So what's it

858
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:52,200
gonna be? What family are you
gonna choose? Are you gonna

859
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:54,436
choose the one that will put
you on the road to becoming a

860
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:58,039
champion? Or are you gonna
choose the one that could lead

861
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:02,277
you to being a back up
dancer in some rap video?

862
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,745
It's not fair.

863
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:08,383
You focus on one or you
fail at both. It's that simple.

864
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:47,956
Hey.

865
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:52,527
Hey.

866
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:54,029
What's up?

867
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:58,934
Nothing. Just starting to
realize my limitations I guess.

868
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,273
I don't think you know the
meaning of limitations. They

869
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:12,113
literally could not stop you
unless they hit you with a car.

870
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,915
Thanks.

871
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:23,391
I think you're
really cool, Ariana.

872
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:28,463
You're pretty cool yourself.

873
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,904
Let's go warm up. So I heard

874
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:39,074
you really brought it at
the dance jam the other day.

875
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:43,245
Well I'm paying for it today.
Is there anything I can do to

876
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,714
take your mind off of it?

877
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:53,054
You just keep massaging,
Mr. That's what I'm good at.

878
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:04,799
I can't do this. There's
something I need to tell you.

879
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:10,105
Hey it's the dancing queen.
Did you see the video we posted

880
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,240
last night?

881
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:16,878
Yeah, I did. And
so did my coach.

882
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,849
Coach? What coach?

883
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:24,853
I need to tell you guys
something. I can't dance with

884
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:29,925
you anymore. My coach wants me
to focus entirely on gymnastics.

885
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:32,360
What?

886
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:34,462
Why didn't you say something?
I didn't know how to. Look,

887
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,264
it's not an easy decision, but
I've been doing gymnastics my

888
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:40,135
entire life.
They're like my family.

889
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:41,636
And what are we?

890
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:45,774
Cashmere, you know it's not
like that. I can't do both.

891
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:50,845
Really? After everything
we've been through? This is it.

892
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:54,149
I'm really sorry.

893
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:58,653
Let's go.

894
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:03,725
Where are you guys going?
We can still practice. Adam?

895
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:16,805
See you later, Ariana.

896
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:30,185
It's alright Soph.

897
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:35,256
Are you kidding me? Where is
your head? Why are you waiting

898
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:38,093
for the audience to give
you your performance and your

899
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:41,162
energy. Why are waiting for
that? It's like you only come

900
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:45,467
alive when your audience notices
you. Your performance starts

901
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:49,337
from the moment you step on
this floor. Not when you get the

902
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,208
applause. Now someone better
show me a collegiate level

903
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:56,344
performance or we're going to
start an hour early everyday

904
01:06:56,346 --> 01:07:01,416
this week. Ariana, you're up.

905
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,688
Sometime today please.

906
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:27,709
Full out. Backhand, snap
down, round off reach into the

907
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:30,378
back handspring, and then
tuck. Reach back into the back

908
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:35,450
handspring stay tight. Pull
legs. Squeeze legs tight to

909
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:41,089
turn. Spot the landing.

910
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,234
What was that?

911
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:56,371
A double back with a full
twist. A Full Out. But I kinda

912
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:58,206
missed the landing. Sorry.

913
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:02,610
I know what a Full Out is.
I meant your music, your whole

914
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:05,947
routine. What was that?

915
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:08,016
Background

Hey.

922
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:56,297
Well look who it is. The
gymnast. Nadia don't-a-need-ya.

923
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:00,168
And how long have you
been waiting to use that one?

924
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,338
She thought it up after
the last time we saw you.

925
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:08,343
Guys, I kinda need a favour.
Can you teach my gymnastics team

926
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:13,248
a few hip hop moves?

927
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:17,285
And why can't you?

928
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:21,022
I can only show them so
much. You guys are the experts.

929
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:24,192
You walked out on us.
Why should we help you?

930
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:29,864
Agreed.

931
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:37,572
Bring it in.
Come on, bring it in.

932
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:48,550
She didn't walk out on us.
Alright? She's a gymnast and

933
01:09:48,552 --> 01:09:53,721
gymnasts have to train. Don't
you think we owe her a little

934
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:58,393
pay back for all the things
she's helped us with? Twist,

935
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,962
man, if Ariana wasn't there you
would have for sure broken your

936
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:07,902
neck on that gain. And Cashmere,
who do you think taught you that

937
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:13,675
incredible back handspring pass?
Adam's right. Surprising

938
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:21,677
because he's never right. But
this time I agree. Okay, fine.

939
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:27,522
We'll teach your sorority
sisters a little soul.

940
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:29,157

941
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:36,598

957
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:33,948
I hope you don't think I
kind of ditched you guys.

You more than kind of ditched
us. But, I don't blame you for

959
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:41,989
getting back to what you're
meant to do. I don't know how

960
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:45,026
we're going to make it at this
audition, but if we do, it's

961
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:46,527
because of you.

962
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:51,399
That is not true. You guys
are an amazing team. Here. It's

963
01:12:56,339 --> 01:13:00,108
the medal from my first
meet. I want you to have it.

964
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,317
So are you going to
be at the audition?

965
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:13,821
I can't. Coach Val wants
me at practice that day.

966
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:18,893

skills. That's what's important.

973
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:12,180
But I do respect the discipline
needed for training. If you're

974
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:18,319
going to do a sit-up, you do
that one sit-up the very best

975
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:25,259
that you can. You don't take
anything for granted. You don't

976
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:31,732
assume that you have tomorrow.
Everything we do in life is a

977
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:38,606
choice. Everything. And those
choices dictate the kind of life

978
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:45,079
that you're gonna lead. And as
soon as you can understand that,

979
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:49,317
then you start to take ownership
of your life, you start to be

980
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:56,057
able to design your life to turn
out whatever way you want it to.

981
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:15,309
And I have a secret for you,
this isn't about gymnastics.

982
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:20,281
It's about life.

983
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,401
Hello?

984
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:42,737
Hey. I just wanted to
wish you luck one last time.

985
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:49,377
Listen, we just got tossed a
huge curve ball. It's Ariana.

986
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,580
Wait, what's going on?

987
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:54,415
The usual.

988
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,851
Is your inhaler working?

989
01:15:56,853 --> 01:16:00,021
I just need a minute.

990
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:06,193
Hey, yeah, no, she's seen
this before, she'll be fine. I

991
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:08,396
just don't think
she'll be able to dance.

992
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,265
Well who's going to
do the handspring pass?

993
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:19,267
I guess we're just gonna have
to lose it. Okay, gotta go.

994
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:28,610
Bruins, let's go!

995
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:32,386
Miss Val?

996
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:34,021
Yes, Ariana.

997
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:38,526
Remember when you told me
to feel it? Now I know what you

998
01:16:38,528 --> 01:16:42,630
mean. I'm feeling it.

999
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:46,200
Well that's great,
Ariana. Now you go get ready.

1000
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:54,202
What I'm saying is, I'm
really, really feeling it.

We'll be out of
balance. It won't look right.

01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:26,233
Then we'll improvise?

1020
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:32,473
We'll make it work. Just go

Mhm.

1037
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,163
If gonna keep keeping
score like this we might find

1038
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:15,402
ourselves into some trouble.

1039
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:23,404
Nice timing.

1040
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:35,155
UCLA need a 9.85 to finish
with the National Championship

1041
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:38,025
title. It appears that Coach
Kondos Field is gonna be putting

1042
01:21:38,027 --> 01:21:41,328
Ariana Berlin up last
on the floor routine.

1043
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:44,365
Only a few years ago Ariana
made a huge comeback into the

1044
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:46,734
world of gymnastics after
suffering a debilitating car

1045
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:48,369
accident.

1046
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:50,437
I was watching practice
earlier today and it seemed like

1047
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:53,407
Ariana was having a lot of
difficulty with her final

1048
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,943
tumbling pass. The Full Out.

1049
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:57,678
This is a somewhat
controversial move for Coach

1050
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:01,181
Kondos Field. We'll
see how she does.

1051
01:22:05,388 --> 01:22:07,421
Thought you said she
was never going to compete?

1052
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,657

1058

We all have our ups and
downs, but it's how you deal

1059
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:25,199
with them that defines who you
are. You must do the thing that

1060
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:27,501
you think you cannot do.

1061
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,205
What do you think? She
gonna stick the landing?

1062
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:35,209
Focus. Two flips with a full
twist. Push off with the right

1063
01:23:35,211 --> 01:23:39,880
leg, momentum
through the round off.

1064
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:41,215
Gymnastics is
pretty much off the table.

1065
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:42,483
She'll never compete.

1066
01:23:42,485 --> 01:23:44,785
I have a metal rod in
my leg. Mom, watch out!

1067
01:23:44,787 --> 01:23:50,357
You're not ready. You can't
do this. Get up. You're broken.

1068
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,825
You'll never compete.

1069
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:53,027
Look, sometimes when the
front door gets slammed in your

1070
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:55,362
face you have to go
through the back door.

1071
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,632
You don't take anything for
granted. You don't assume that

1072
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:00,634
you have tomorrow.

1073
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:01,402
You're gonna be okay.

1074
01:24:01,404 --> 01:24:03,170
There's always a way in.

1075
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:08,642
Go make room 404 proud. Get up.
You've got this. You've got this.

1076
01:24:08,644 --> 01:24:13,881
You've got this.

1077
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:21,883
Let the daylight show

1078
01:24:34,003 --> 01:24:35,436
Mind if I borrow this?

1079
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:43,438
Nope.

1080
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:49,283
I realize this is kind of
unorthodox, but nothing about

1081
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:52,119
the past few years of my life
has been orthodox, so here it

1082
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:56,090
goes. Several years ago, I was
told by my doctors that I was

1083
01:24:56,092 --> 01:25:00,260
likely to never do gymnastics
again. But I didn't believe

1084
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:05,199
them. I had a bunch of
people who stood behind me and

1085
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:10,204
encouraged me every step of the
way. I want to give a special

1086
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:13,774
shoutout to my friend, Caity,
because I know you're watching

1087
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:19,313
this right now. Caity, even
though you're a little behind me

1088
01:25:19,315 --> 01:25:22,783
in your recovery, you'll be
running circles around me

1089
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:28,088
forever. With every person
you make walk again, the world

1090
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:33,560
becomes a better place. There's
no medal for that, but what's a

1091
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:39,900
medal anyway, right? And
Michelle, there's definitely no

1092
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:44,471
medal I could give you to truly
show my thanks. But I just might

1093
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:49,076
be able to get you your million
hits. That's gotta be worth
