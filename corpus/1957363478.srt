00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,330
- [Preacher] Lord almighty.

366
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,460
But why is he here?

367
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,160
- The vivandiere brought him in.

368
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,030
Thought he was one of ours.

369
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,770
I guess you'd say we
have as much obligation

370
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,770
to his soul as any other.

- I know, you're feverish,
but you're out of the woods.

396
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,260
The colonel needs
to see you now.

- Colonel, who's,
who's the colonel?

- I shouldn't be here.

409
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,770
I shouldn't be here.

410
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,550
- Do the Yankees have
a railhead there?

411
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,550
We need to know.

412
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,550

your best there, Carolina.

Why, we can't hardly get that
gal to say two words in a row.

440

- Maybe you Missouri
boys need someone

441
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,380
to show you how it's done.

442
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,810

close to this lady,

451
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,660

What then may I ask is that?

And how is it you were found

485
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,030
practically inside yankee lines?

- Stop it, that's enough.

494
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,020
- He stayed behind with
the yankee wounded.

495
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,500
- Miss, who is he?

496
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,760

00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,330
- Private Alan Healy, 10th
Ohio United States army.

499
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,340
He is a wounded prisoner.

500

504
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,470

private Alan Healy

505
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,220
was brought to our
bosom wearing gray

506
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,000
and yesterday,
private Alan Healy

507
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,830
used those false pretenses
to give US false information.

508
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,310
And if private Alan
Healy cannot give

509
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,310
a good account of himself
at his trial tomorrow,

510
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,490

00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,520
we have had some hard
decisions forced upon US.

525
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,520
The loss of our property
was regrettable,

526
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,960
but inevitable given the decline

527
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,700
and faced without adequate help.

528
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,350
We will write to you as
soon as we're settled

529
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,960
and trust that anything
addressed to the regiment

530

Miss?

536
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,290
- Leave her.

537
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,210
Leave her.

538
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,990
I know her.

539
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,730
She is from my town.

540
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,300
I remember when
she was this high.

541
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,780
- Miss, he rarely drinks.

542
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,300
It's only after a battle.

before the war.

Isn't that right?

545
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,620
I was glad of that.

546
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,230

little sorry for you.

Fine.

730
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,400
There are boys who've
seen worse than he will,

731
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,230
when they were
younger than he is.

732
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,880
This is your last chance.

733
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,240
- Josiah, would
you like a treat?

734
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,120
Here's what you need to do.

735
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,160
Stand up, face that wall
and cover your ears.

736
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,080
Then you'll hear a very loud
noise like papa's shotgun.

737
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:43,170
If you don't flinch or cry
or turn around before I tell,

738
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,960
you'll get a treat.

739
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,830
Do you understand?

740
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,570
If you can do that, all
will be well, I promise.

741
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:18,120
Colonel, gunner foucher never
met the Yankees that day.

742
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
He, met, me.

743
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,210
Now is your moment.

744
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,960
[Glasses pinging]

745
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,570
[Tense music]

746
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,270
[Trigger clicks]

747
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,230
[Dramatic music]

748
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:55,460
[Gun fires]
[Glass shatters]

749
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,160
- Ma?

750
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,170
- Darling, take him
into the kitchen.

751
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,260
We'll handle things in here.

752
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,480
- No, you take him.

753
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,260
This is our job.

754
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,650
- I want to stay.

755
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,090
- Josie, you can't,
someone's hurt.

756
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,220
- I know, I want to stay.

757
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,580
[Colonel moaning]

758
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,670
- [Alan's sister] It's a
winging more than anything.

759
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,500
He has a chance.

760
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,280
- Can we fix him?

761
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,850
- Are you fearless
today, little Josie?

762
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,980
Maybe we can.

763
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,510
Like as not, cracked a few ribs.

764
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,250
Right now, it's the bleeding
we have to worry about.

765
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,210
- [Vivandiere] You take
this, keep his head down.

766
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,610
- Yeah, you traitors.

767
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:58,090
You vile turncoats.

768
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,660
What have you done to me?

769
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,620
Joe-fired adventuresses,
what have you done to me?

770
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,440
- Shh.

771
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,270
[Gentle music]
