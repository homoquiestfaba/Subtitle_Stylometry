1
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,511
<b>THE WRONG CAR</b>

2
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,469
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,298
Charles!

4
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:40,601
Hey, Trudy!
I thought that might be you.

5
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:41,934
I didn't know you
drove a NetCar.

6
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,336
I do. Hop in.

7
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,353
So where are we
headed tonight?

8
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:02,722
I'm headed to Tatnuck Square.

9
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,222
Corner of Pleasant
and Copperfield.

10
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:14,933
You know, I don't normally
splurge on a black car,

11
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,937
but this is really nice.

12
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:22,040
So, working late?

13
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:24,777
Yeah, this Criminology
class is kicking my butt.

14
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,812
Look, I can help
you if you want.

15
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:27,946
Charles!

16
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,282
Okay,
don't get all defensive,

17
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:31,918
it's just an offer.

18
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,024
Do you feel safe?

19
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,426
How so?

20
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,196
You know, letting strange
people into your car.

21
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:47,700
I mean, you're bound
to get some crazies.

22
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,735
You know, my mother
always told me,

23
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,903
don't pick up hitchhikers

24
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:53,939
or get into strangers cars.

25
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,978
Well, I know more about
you than you think.

26
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,180
Trudy O'Donnell,
four point seven stars.

27
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:03,014
What?

28
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:04,515
Someone didn't give me a "five".

29
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,854
Clearly. You ticked them off pretty
bad if they only gave you a "four".

30
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,088
Clearly.

31
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:13,124
No, I feel safe enough, though.

32
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:15,895
Plus, I don't have to
deal with any cash.

33
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:19,065
That's true.

34
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,968
You know what, Charles,
just go a little further up.

35
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,972
I'm on the right, 92.

36
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,779
See you later.

37
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:41,486
Thanks, Charles.

38
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,821
You are so welcome.

39
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:44,490
Hey, I'll see you
in class, okay?

40
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:46,092
-Yes, you will.
-All right.

41
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:48,728
Hey, Trudy...

42
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,396
you just earned
yourself five stars.

43
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,732
Back at you!

44
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,797
Hey, what time is it?

45
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:00,299
A little before 2:00.

46
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,468
Did I wake you?

47
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,303
No, I had to pee.

48
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:08,438
You look exhausted.

49
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,341
I'm fine.

50
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,877
You're not fine!

51
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,112
You've got bags
under your eyes.

52
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:16,949
You're too skinny and you
haven't showered in three days.

53
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:18,117
Two!

54
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,519
Three! I'm counting.

55
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:23,288
Yeah, well, I'm busy.

56
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,958
That's bull!
You're hiding.

57
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,192
Hiding from what?

58
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:29,562
Real life.

59
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:33,999
Yeah, real life
starts next year.

60
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,499
What?

61
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:39,605
When you work 90 hours a week as a
lackey in some high-powered law firm?

62
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,307
Yeah, well, it's what I want.

63
00:06:42,908 --> 00:06:44,143
You know what?

64
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:46,478
We're going to go out.

65
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:48,347
-Gretch...
-No! Stop.

66
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,014
We're going out.
You need it.

67
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,350
Yeah, like a hole in the head.

68
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:54,485
I am so sick of seeing you
moping around,

69
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:56,555
trying not to think
of that damn ex of yours.

70
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:58,890
We're going out.

71
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:04,863
We're not going out!

72
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:10,636
The classical theory
of criminal justice

73
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:14,240
revolves around the idea that
a person who breaks the law

74
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:17,643
does so with rational free will

75
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,808
and that society therefore

76
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,848
should design a punishment
of equal severity to the crime.

77
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,484
Miss O'Donnell.

78
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:28,454
But a pre-requisite
for the classical philosophy

79
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:30,588
is that all humans
are hedonists.

80
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:32,603
That we prefer pleasure
over pain and are

81
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:34,293
therefore deterred
from committing crimes

82
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,429
by the threat of
uncomfortable circumstances.

83
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,531
I'm not sure
I buy that.

84
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:42,001
So you are more
of a positivist then?

85
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,334
Well, yes.

86
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,305
Like Comte, I think that
our criminal justice system

87
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:50,276
should work to improve society, not
cater to its most base instinct.

88
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,378
The problem is,
is that our penal system

89
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,680
is absolutely classical
in its theory and design.

90
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:57,283
Okay, is it really
classical by design?

91
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,051
Or is that just
in practice?

92
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,054
The forces that push people
into criminal behavior,

93
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:03,555
whether it's
social or psychological,

94
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,692
I mean, even biological,
those are the same forces

95
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,662
that push our penal system back to
that classical way of thinking.

96
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,665
That is a frightening thought.

97
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:16,100
So you're saying that people would
rather retaliate than rehabilitate?

98
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:17,436
Absolutely.

99
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:21,574
I mean, it is human nature,
right? Eye for an eye? Hammurabi.

100
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:26,945
Society tries, but they can't seem
to reign in that innate aggression.

101
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:30,982
Hence the debate behind the
western philosophy of legalism.

102
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:34,453
Thank you both so very much,
we're out of time for today.

103
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:37,088
Bring it back here
next time when we discuss

104
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:41,059
the vital importance of an
uncontaminated crime scene

105
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:43,661
in the forensic examination
of trace evidence.

106
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,665
Don't come in here if you
don't do the reading.

107
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,741
Hey, you know, I think where
the classical theory breaks down

108
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,679
is with the assumption
that the criminal

109
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,572
mind is rational.
I mean, it's not.

110
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:58,569
Do you want to grab
a coffee and discuss it?

111
00:08:58,603 --> 00:08:59,805
Nice try.

112
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,708
What? Did I say
something wrong?

113
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,377
I'm not interested,
Charles.

114
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,779
I told you
a million times.

115
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,581
Thanks again for the ride.

116
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:17,589
It's just coffee.

117
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:41,282
I did not need that
last Fireball shot.

118
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,318
That wasn't
the last one.

119
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,021
We're about to get another
round for those guys.

120
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:47,555
No,
no, no, no.

121
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,590
I am going home.

122
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,192
You're such a lightweight.

123
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,626
The night's just
getting started.

124
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,062
Really? Okay.

125
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,529
I'm having fun, I am.

126
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,431
But I have so much
to do tomorrow,

127
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,234
and I just need to go home
before it gets ugly.

128
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,070
Come on,
that guy is so cute.

129
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,541
I know,
that's why I need to leave.

130
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:10,045
Okay, honestly, I'm
not ready to go yet.

131
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,214
Just stay then.
I'll take a NetCar.

132
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,748
-One more shot.
-Gretch.

133
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,553
-Okay, I love you.
-Bye. Love you.

134
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,071
92, Pleasant.

135
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:26,320
There's water back
there if you want.

136
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,469
Thank you,
I needed that.

137
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:56,626
911 dispatch,
what is your emergency?

138
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,164
Hello?

139
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:03,066
911 dispatch,
how may I help you?

140
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,971
I... I think
I've been raped.

141
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:48,878
Okay, Trudy.

142
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,114
Now I need to do
a speculum exam,

143
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:55,420
which mean I need to do an
internal vaginal and anal swab.

144
00:15:56,686 --> 00:15:57,821
Would you like me
to continue?

145
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,191
Yes.

146
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,842
This is an emergency
contraceptive

147
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,944
and a clinic where
you can have an HIV test.

148
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,646
Thanks.

149
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,484
That rape kit exam
is not easy,

150
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:30,120
but it is crucial in gathering
the evidence we need to find,

151
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:33,022
try and convict this guy.

152
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,191
When will we get the results?

153
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:38,127
That can take several weeks.

154
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,129
Several weeks?

155
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:42,999
Trudy, this is a long
and difficult process.

156
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,770
But you've taken the hardest
step in reporting your assault.

157
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:49,473
Now you just need to be patient
and let us do our job.

158
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:53,578
In the meantime, what can you
tell me about what happened?

159
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:55,846
That's the thing,
I don't remember.

160
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,883
It's like it was
all just erased.

161
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:02,519
Sounds like Rohypnol.

162
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:04,522
A roofie?

163
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:05,957
Were you drinking last night?

164
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:08,659
Yes.

165
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:11,027
It's really easy
to slip into a drink.

166
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,931
Plus, combined with alcohol,
it can cause memory impairment.

167
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:17,200
The tox screen will
confirm the results,

168
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,836
but for now it's a good
bet that it's Rohypnol.

169
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,139
Who had access to your
drinks last night?

170
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:26,043
I don't know,
the bartender...

171
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,717
The guys we were dancing
with, they bought us shots.

172
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:34,919
Trud.

173
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:37,521
-Gretchen.
-My gosh!

174
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,659
I was so worried about you.

175
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,027
Are you okay?

176
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,261
No.

177
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:48,832
Here, let's get you home.

178
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:51,067
I've brought you clothes.

179
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:53,637
We can continue this later.

180
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,306
-Go home.
-Thank you.

181
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:58,743
Come on.

182
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,232
That's the thing...

183
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,400
I don't remember.

184
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,572
I remember getting
into the NetCar...

185
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,012
and then waking up
in a motel room naked.

186
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,480
I shouldn't have
made you come out.

187
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,551
And I shouldn't have
let you leave alone.

188
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,121
I'm just glad you're okay.

189
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,790
-I mean, those two guys, I thought...
-What?

190
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,691
What? No, those two
guys were harmless.

191
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:50,661
Who was your driver?

192
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:53,697
I never thought about that.

193
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,275
I got a "no show".

194
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,110
What does that mean?

195
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:11,149
It means my car showed up
and I wasn't there.

196
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,484
-Then who drove you?
-Exactly.

197
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:16,053
God, I'm such an idiot.

198
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:19,424
I mean, I just hopped into a black
car and assumed it was my ride.

199
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:21,292
Trud, it was an honest mistake.

200
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:23,260
Okay? I would've
done the same thing.

201
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:24,661
-It's not your fault.
-No.

202
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,432
It's my fault.

203
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:42,720
-Hi, I'm Detective Jackson.
-Hi.

204
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:44,621
Westchester PD.

205
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,557
Were you on duty
the night of May 14th.

206
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,626
Yeah.

207
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:51,829
Are you aware that a rape
occurred in room 106.

208
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:53,897
Yeah, my boss had
told me about it.

209
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:58,802
I understand that the man who
rented that room paid in cash.

210
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:03,941
Yeah, if that's what it says in
the ledger, then yeah, I suppose.

211
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:06,543
And you didn't
ask him for ID?

212
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:09,012
Or have him fill out
an information card?

213
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:12,716
Hey, lady, look, most of
the people that stay here,

214
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,554
they like to stay anonymous,
you know what I mean?

215
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:18,890
So it's your policy
not to ask for ID?

216
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,524
If they pay in cash.

217
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:22,993
Did you see what
was driving?

218
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,896
Black town car, maybe?

219
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:28,798
Something boxy, dark.

220
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,434
License plate?

221
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:31,802
You serious?

222
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:36,373
I'm going to need to see your security
camera footage from that night.

223
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:38,775
Good luck with that.

224
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,578
Do you think this is funny?

225
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,851
It's $9.99 online.

226
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:50,855
Put a double A battery
right in there,

227
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:53,057
and it makes that
little red light go.

228
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,360
Looks pretty convincing?
It fooled you, detective, so...

229
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:00,665
All right, so what can you
tell me about this guy?

230
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:04,935
Pretty average.

231
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,436
5'10" or so.

232
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,839
A little heavy set.

233
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,674
How was dressed?

234
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,610
Not bad.

235
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:17,415
Pretty sharp for somebody
that would stay here at least.

236
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:22,552
Would you be willing to work
with one of our sketch artists?

237
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:23,721
Yeah, yeah, I mean...

238
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:27,590
If you want to talk to my
boss, sort it out, so...

239
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:28,926
Okay, thank you
for your time.

240
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,894
-Yeah, sure.
-I'll be in touch.

241
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:32,897
Look forward to it.

242
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:50,481
Hey.

243
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:51,748
Not going
to class today?

244
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:54,152
No, I don't feel
up for it.

245
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:58,522
Do you want me
to stay with you today?

246
00:21:58,554 --> 00:21:59,856
-No.
-You sure?

247
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:01,993
Yeah.

248
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:05,995
All right, well...

249
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,198
get outside.

250
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:08,566
Get some exercise
or something.

251
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,834
I will.

252
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:12,169
-Seriously.
-I will.

253
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:15,005
It sounds like
a good idea.

254
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:19,811
Hey.

255
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:26,050
You're gonna be okay.

256
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:27,685
Am I?

257
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:30,687
Of course, you are.

258
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:34,791
You are a strong, angry woman
who can make a difference.

259
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:37,962
Yeah, but how?

260
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:41,599
Well...

261
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,335
that's something you're
gonna have to figure out.

262
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:49,907
-Bye.
-Bye.

263
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:51,908
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

264
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:49,634
Hello.

265
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:51,801
Mom.

266
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,069
Sweetie?

267
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:55,672
What's wrong?

268
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,962
Trudy, come in.

269
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:21,165
I was just about
to call you.

270
00:24:21,197 --> 00:24:23,666
The results of your
tox screen have come back.

271
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:24,734
And?

272
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:27,771
You tested positive
for the drug Flunitrazepam.

273
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:30,040
Rohypnol, as we suspected.

274
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:31,675
What about the rest
of my rape kit?

275
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:34,677
Well, none of the forensic
diagnostics have been done yet.

276
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:36,914
Unfortunately, there's
a backlog of these.

277
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:39,949
But the lab technician did tell me
that there was vaginal swelling

278
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:41,551
consistent with intercourse,

279
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:43,286
and that she was
able to identify

280
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:45,789
a small piece of latex
and a semen sample.

281
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,859
Great. So raped me
and the condom broke.

282
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:52,029
Yes, but that does
give us an advantage.

283
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,666
Doesn't necessarily know this
and now we have a DNA sample.

284
00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,637
I mean, did you
learn anything else?

285
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:03,239
Anything at the motel? Did
anyone at the club see anything?

286
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:05,341
No. Unfortunately not.

287
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,145
Knew what was doing, and covered
his tracks pretty well.

288
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:11,982
Did this case fit
any other MO?

289
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,751
Any other case that
you might be looking into?

290
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:16,887
We cross-referenced his methods,
the car, the motel,

291
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,822
but until we get forensic
evidence back from the lab,

292
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:21,392
it's just too early to tell.

293
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:25,429
Just out of curiosity,

294
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,897
how many of these cases
do you actually solve?

295
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,334
I don't know,
it's hard to say.

296
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:33,404
Educated guess?

297
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:37,742
20 to 30 percent.

298
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,177
I actually looked into it.

299
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:45,149
And nationally, only 32%
of all rape cases are reported.

300
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:46,817
That sounds about right.

301
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,121
7% of those lead to an arrest
and only 2% are convicted.

302
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:53,723
Yes.

303
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:59,195
That means that 98% of all rapists
are walking the streets free.

304
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:01,698
Not very good odds.

305
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:04,301
No.

306
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,769
I'm afraid not.

307
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:13,792
Hi, Charles.

308
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:15,394
Trudy, hi!

309
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:17,663
Did you change your mind
about that coffee?

310
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:21,099
I want to learn
to drive a NetCar.

311
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:30,574
Hey.

312
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:34,112
Wait, so you know
how the app works?

313
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:35,146
Yeah.

314
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,617
You get an alert when you're
in the vicinity of a fare.

315
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,752
Seriously, pay attention
to that star rating.

316
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:44,022
You do not have to pick up anybody that
you are not comfortable with, okay?

317
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:45,957
-Okay.
-Okay.

318
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,893
You upgraded your insurance?

319
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:49,260
Yes.

320
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:52,130
Do you have a case of water in
the trunk? I get it, I get it.

321
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:54,433
You got it? You got it? Okay. Really,
you're gonna be awesome, okay?

322
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:56,067
Call me if you have
any questions.

323
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,668
Thanks, Charles,
I really appreciate it.

324
00:26:58,869 --> 00:26:59,904
You're welcome.

325
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,511
You know, you never
did exactly tell me,

326
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:08,747
why're you doing
this anyway?

327
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,648
A little extra cash,
just like you.

328
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,854
Something more to it
though, isn't there?

329
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:20,658
Yeah, okay.
I got it.

330
00:27:20,692 --> 00:27:22,528
Listen, good luck.
You're gonna be great, okay?

331
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:24,696
Charles.

332
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,095
I can't believe you told
him you were from Sweden.

333
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:58,496
What?
Wasn't I convincing?

334
00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:59,865
No, not even close.

335
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:02,500
Okay, we're going
to 14 Schuster Road.

336
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:06,037
"Vit Logn"
is a little white lie.

337
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:08,039
I tell you
a little vit logn.

338
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:10,140
You are the most
handsome man I see today.

339
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:12,109
And goes, "really?"

340
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,645
Classic.

341
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:15,846
You girls go to Becker?

342
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:16,914
Yeah, one more year.

343
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,950
Nice. I got my undergrad there.

344
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:21,185
Really? And now
you're driving NetCar?

345
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:22,888
It's really encouraging.

346
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:25,189
Sorry, just kidding.

347
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:26,991
You know, you don't
know anything about me.

348
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,294
Sorry, I was just kidding.

349
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:30,828
I didn't mean anything by it.

350
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:32,297
Like, seriously, you don't
know anything about me

351
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:35,000
and you just hopped right into my
car and gave me your home address.

352
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:37,969
You should be more careful.

353
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,538
I saw you arriving on my phone.

354
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,106
Driver Trudy,
grey Corolla.

355
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:43,976
-What? That's not you?
-No, that's me.

356
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:47,178
But people aren't always
who they say they are.

357
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:48,881
Whatever.

358
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,635
-Hi.
-Hi.

359
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:52,778
So how long have you been
using the NetCar service for?

360
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:56,615
Couple of years now.

361
00:29:56,647 --> 00:29:59,183
Couple of years and you still have
five stars, that's impressive.

362
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:02,120
Well, let me tell you, a little
courtesy goes a long way.

363
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:05,056
Isn't that the truth.

364
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,359
God, I just snapped
at a customer...

365
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:09,660
cost me about half a star.

366
00:30:10,694 --> 00:30:11,695
Yikes!

367
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:13,332
What happened?

368
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,601
It... It doesn't matter.

369
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:19,404
Just having a tough
couple of weeks.

370
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:22,339
Worst chapter
of my life, really.

371
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:25,110
Well, I'm not having
a great week either.

372
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:27,279
My girlfriend
broke up with me.

373
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:31,249
I'm sorry.

374
00:30:32,383 --> 00:30:33,852
That's all right.
It's not your fault.

375
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,055
I should've seen it coming.

376
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:39,324
Let me ask you this,

377
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:42,760
when a woman says,
"it's not you, it's me."

378
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:44,829
Like, should I
believe that?

379
00:30:44,862 --> 00:30:45,997
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

380
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:48,333
No, she's just
softening the blow.

381
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:52,136
Well, thank you
for the ego boost.

382
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:56,374
I mean, it maybe her
feelings that have changed,

383
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:58,976
but, I mean, it's you
she fell in love with.

384
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:14,259
Are you okay?

385
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:17,362
You okay?

386
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:19,364
Yeah.

387
00:31:19,396 --> 00:31:21,433
Yeah.

388
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,267
Better to face these
things head on?

389
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,736
-That's what I always say.
-That's right.

390
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:27,939
Still... Still stings though.

391
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,173
Yeah.

392
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,315
This looks good right here.
That's great.

393
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:39,350
Okay.

394
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:50,728
...look, I'm sorry for emotionally
unloading on you like that.

395
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:51,996
No problem.

396
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:55,099
You know, if I ever
need another ride,

397
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:57,268
is there a way that
I could just request you?

398
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,472
Well, you have my work
phone number in your cell.

399
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,475
So if I'm available I'd
be happy to pick you up.

400
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:06,344
Well... that's not
what I meant.

401
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:07,945
What did you mean?

402
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:11,014
I meant I want to call you.
You know?

403
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:12,150
Call you-call you.

404
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:15,252
I don't think
that's a good idea.

405
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,155
No, you're right,
that's stupid.

406
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,760
Sorry.

407
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,962
Well, you have a good
night, all right?

408
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:26,364
-You, too.
-Okay.

409
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,547
Any experienced crime scene
officer is going to tell you,

410
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,608
that the most important
thing they can do

411
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,852
to ensure that any
evidence that they find

412
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:51,789
stands up in court...

413
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:55,460
is to control and secure
that crime scene.

414
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:57,462
So we're talking
about a large perimeter.

415
00:32:57,494 --> 00:33:00,231
We're talking about
essential personnel only.

416
00:33:00,263 --> 00:33:01,766
What about the victim?

417
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:04,568
Victims get attended to.

418
00:33:04,602 --> 00:33:07,105
Attended to?

419
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,240
Dr. Bell...

420
00:33:09,272 --> 00:33:11,255
every TV crime drama
I've ever seen is

421
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,410
hammered home the idea
of a clean crime scene,

422
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:16,280
but shouldn't the rights of the
victim and her well-being come first?

423
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:19,384
No.

424
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,353
Not at the expense of evidence that's
going to convict a perpetrator.

425
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,021
Really? So...

426
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:28,159
a rape victim
for example,

427
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:32,197
who is just been violated
and assaulted,

428
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,697
and can't shower

429
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:38,268
has to sit through five hours of a
de-humanizing rape kit examination

430
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:40,806
before anybody asks her
if she's okay.

431
00:33:42,505 --> 00:33:45,231
I think the majority of
our crime scene officers

432
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:45,287
and our law
enforcement personnel

433
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:50,182
are more compassionate
than that, Miss O'Donnell.

434
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:01,897
Which way did come from?

435
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,536
That way.

436
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:09,359
I mean, was waiting
for someone like you.

437
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:12,896
Might've already
been watching.

438
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:18,502
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

439
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:38,922
Was parked
right there.

440
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,725
Perfect view to the
entrance of the club.

441
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:47,396
I mean, was just waiting
for a single girl to come out

442
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,232
who looked like she was
going to get a NetCar.

443
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:51,534
I was a sitting duck.

444
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:14,590
-Hi.
-Hi.

445
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:19,028
Do you mind if we take
a look at room 106?

446
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:22,266
I'm not really supposed
to just to let you into a room.

447
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,802
You know what?
It's fine. It's fine.

448
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,804
You just make sure
that nobody's in there.

449
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,343
Nope.

450
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:37,714
You...

451
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:40,416
You don't mind if I ask you
what this is all about, do you?

452
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,519
Did you work the night
of May 14th?

453
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:44,653
Yeah, I did
as a matter of fact.

454
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,056
But, the cops
already came

455
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,325
and I told them
everything I know. So...

456
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:53,796
Yeah, I was the girl.

457
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:58,767
That's messed up.

458
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,036
I'm sorry.

459
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,072
Is this you? Mark?

460
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:05,941
No, no. Mark's the manager here.
I'm Roger.

461
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,876
Give me the pen.

462
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:09,745
Roger what?

463
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:11,715
Roger Dennison.

464
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:16,885
Great.

465
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,487
Okay.

466
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:20,457
Sorry, it's...

467
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,525
-It's the silver one.
-I'll bring it right back.

468
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,860
Take your time.

469
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,642
Gosh, this place
is a dump.

470
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,557
What do you remember?

471
00:36:58,494 --> 00:36:59,796
I woke up right here.

472
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:24,920
It just
doesn't make sense.

473
00:37:29,157 --> 00:37:32,061
I mean, it's his face...

474
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:34,731
It's bizarre.

475
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,034
It's okay. It's okay,
don't force it.

476
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:42,905
I put up a fight.

477
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,709
I remember that.

478
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:57,620
Is this helping?

479
00:37:57,653 --> 00:37:58,988
Yes.

480
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:01,157
I want to get
inside his head.

481
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,126
Find the flaws
in the system.

482
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:06,095
I've been thinking
about it 24/7 anyway.

483
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:08,999
Might as well feel like I'm
actively answering questions.

484
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:13,235
And the cops
still have nothing?

485
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:14,638
Nope.

486
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:19,476
All right. Well,
don't work too late.

487
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:21,445
-I won't.
-All right...

488
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:24,146
before I forget.

489
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,883
What is this?

490
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,184
It's pepper spray.

491
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:31,520
If I could buy you
a gun, I would, but...

492
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:33,923
just in case.

493
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:36,092
Be careful.

494
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:45,000
Hey, Gretch.

495
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,104
Thanks for everything.

496
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,202
Detective Jackson.

497
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:22,070
It's...

498
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:24,608
It's Trudy O'Donnell.
I thought about something.

499
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,744
Knows where I live.

500
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:31,080
Okay, it's all right. How
does know your address?

501
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:33,115
I told him.

502
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,019
When I got in the car,
I told him my address.

503
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:41,057
I'm usually so careful to just
give them the cross streets.

504
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:45,061
Has been there? Have you
noticed anything suspicious?

505
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:47,797
No.

506
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,934
I can't believe I gave
him my address.

507
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:57,005
Trudy, the crime committed
against you was not personal.

508
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,310
It was violent and intimate,
but not personal.

509
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:03,345
Nothing you did
caused the attack.

510
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:06,282
You were just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

511
00:40:08,383 --> 00:40:11,253
Do they ever go after
the same person twice?

512
00:40:13,188 --> 00:40:15,691
I can't say that
it never happens,

513
00:40:15,724 --> 00:40:17,293
but it is rare.

514
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:18,827
These kind of crimes
are opportunistic.

515
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:22,097
It's not your fault.
Do you understand me?

516
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:24,867
No, I don't.

517
00:40:26,202 --> 00:40:27,237
Bye.

518
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,905
Hey, you look like
you could use one.

519
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,408
-Hey, Charles.
-Hey.

520
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,246
Yeah, I could actually use a
coffee. Is there cream in it?

521
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:51,215
Cream and one equal.
Just how you like it.

522
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,385
Thank you.
How do you know that?

523
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,788
I pay attention.

524
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,924
So...

525
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,060
how is the NetCar
driving going?

526
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:05,463
You never warned me that I'd
have to become a therapist.

527
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:07,898
People do tell you their
problems, don't they?

528
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,068
My God,
do they ever?

529
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,938
Vanderbilt rape case?

530
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,407
Yeah, what do you
know about it?

531
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:18,709
Well, they were idiots.

532
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,011
I mean, not that
it's any less atrocious,

533
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:23,747
but they didn't go out that night
planning to rape that girl.

534
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,677
Circumstances just
took a dark turn

535
00:41:25,678 --> 00:41:27,452
when they brought her back
to the dorm passed out.

536
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:31,188
Do you know the prosecutors knew
that because the boys kissed her?

537
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,391
Really?

538
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:34,925
Yeah.

539
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,461
Like she was
their girlfriend.

540
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,363
And like, she might
be turned on.

541
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:41,331
Like, there might
be consent.

542
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:44,935
But of course,
there wasn't.

543
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:46,370
She was unconscious.

544
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:51,943
Charles...

545
00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:54,912
what does a kiss
mean to you?

546
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,184
I mean, do you
want me to show you?

547
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:01,785
Charles!

548
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:03,153
Okay, all right.

549
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,388
Sorry.

550
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:09,260
But a kiss can be even more
intimate than intercourse.

551
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:16,267
Yeah.

552
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:42,240
Hey, baby, how are we
doing tonight?

553
00:42:42,274 --> 00:42:44,275
Where are you headed?

554
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:47,978
Why so cold? What's a smoke show
like you doing working for NetCar?

555
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,180
I'm not your baby.

556
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:51,381
I don't know
about that.

557
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:54,184
I do know you're smoking hot.
I'd do you in a heartbeat.

558
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:56,454
Get out. Get out.
Get out of my car.

559
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:58,389
-Get out of my car.
-Hey!

560
00:42:58,421 --> 00:42:59,657
There ain't no point
in making a scene.

561
00:42:59,689 --> 00:43:02,260
Was just messing with you.
Didn't mean nothing by it.

562
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:05,028
Come on, can we just all get back
in and go where we need to go?

563
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:06,430
No! Get out
of my goddamn car.

564
00:43:06,463 --> 00:43:07,698
Hey, look.

565
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:11,535
I'm sorry about what I said. It
was wrong. It won't happen again.

566
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:14,571
Listen, it's not worth
a bad customer rating.

567
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:19,043
Really. I'm sorry.

568
00:43:19,075 --> 00:43:21,430
Come on, Trudy, me
and my boy Carlos here,

569
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,347
we're not looking
for any trouble.

570
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:25,684
We just want to go out
and have a little fun.

571
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,486
Yeah?
Where are you going?

572
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,689
What's that strip club
down on Southbridge Street.

573
00:43:32,722 --> 00:43:33,757
Sweaty Betty's.

574
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:36,294
Typhoon Betty's, really?

575
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:39,597
Yeah! No doubt.
You know it?

576
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:43,001
Come on, I'll be good,
I promise.

577
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:44,202
No hard feelings.

578
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:49,373
Okay.

579
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,575
One more crack
and you're out.

580
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:54,077
I like your fight, girl.

581
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:55,280
Yeah, get in the car.

582
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:10,995
Hey, Carlos' sister, she's a
dancer down at Sweaty Betty's.

583
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,431
We just going to keep
an eye on her.

584
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,665
No, seriously, yeah?

585
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,113
Carlos and me, we get
all the tail we want.

586
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:22,539
We don't need to go
hang out at no strip bar.

587
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,210
All right. Okay, yeah, I know.
"Watch my language."

588
00:44:27,244 --> 00:44:28,579
I'll shut up!

589
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:33,350
You know, it's not about the language.
It's about respecting women.

590
00:44:33,383 --> 00:44:35,686
I respect
Carlos' sister.

591
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:40,291
Yeah. She is a dime piece.
Yeah.

592
00:44:40,323 --> 00:44:42,459
See? That. That right there.

593
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:44,761
You immediately
sexually objectified her.

594
00:44:44,794 --> 00:44:46,696
No, I respect her beauty.

595
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:49,833
Do you? Or do you just
want to have sex with her?

596
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:52,669
Well...

597
00:44:52,702 --> 00:44:54,838
Maybe. But, you know,
she's Carlos' sister.

598
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:57,207
He'd probably like, straight
up kill me, right, Carlos?

599
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,408
No doubt.

600
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:08,737
Hey, I don't know
if you believe me,

601
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,485
but no means
no with me.

602
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:15,255
I take that stuff
really serious.

603
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:27,134
It's Manuel.

604
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:32,948
Hey, Trudy.

605
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,116
Change of plans,
pull over here.

606
00:45:41,022 --> 00:45:42,790
Stay in the car!

607
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,658
End our ride.

608
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:46,260
But you're not
getting out.

609
00:45:46,294 --> 00:45:47,982
Please, I freaking respect you.

610
00:45:47,983 --> 00:45:50,932
Now just do what I told
you and end our ride.

611
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:52,800
No! Not if you're not
getting out of the car.

612
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:56,104
My! My God. Okay.

613
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:59,240
There!
I ended it.

614
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:01,142
What do you want?
I don't have any cash.

615
00:46:01,174 --> 00:46:02,843
Give me five stars.

616
00:46:05,278 --> 00:46:07,848
There! Okay, fine.
I gave you five stars.

617
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:09,818
Now turn off your phone.
You're going on break.

618
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,586
God, please don't hurt me.

619
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,990
There, it's off.

620
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,926
Good. Turn around.
U-Turn.

621
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:20,062
We're going
to get Manuel.

622
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,908
Okay, look... Look, I'll
cooperate, but you're making me

623
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:37,312
really nervous with that
gun in my face, okay?

624
00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:39,013
Can you please
put it away?

625
00:46:41,115 --> 00:46:43,952
Yeah. Sorry.

626
00:46:43,984 --> 00:46:45,986
But if you try anything it comes
right back out. Understand?

627
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:48,255
Okay. Okay.
Okay, fine.

628
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:49,890
Thank you.

629
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,332
Where are you
taking me?

630
00:46:58,365 --> 00:47:00,301
It doesn't matter.
Take a right up ahead.

631
00:47:09,477 --> 00:47:10,846
Ay, ay, ay! There is.

632
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:15,749
You guys!

633
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:17,886
Is - Is okay?

634
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,789
Guys, we need to take
him to a hospital!

635
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,289
Shut the hell up!

636
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:24,025
We gotta get him
to Doc Espinoza.

637
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:25,225
No, no, no.
Needs an ambulance.

638
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:27,294
No ambulance!

639
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:28,829
-Get in the car.
-No!

640
00:47:28,863 --> 00:47:30,198
-Get in the car.
-No!

641
00:47:30,231 --> 00:47:31,999
-Mira.
-Okay.

642
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:37,004
Let's go.

643
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:48,182
It's okay. It's okay.

644
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:51,352
Memorial Hospital.
It's the closest.

645
00:47:51,385 --> 00:47:54,155
No, no, I told you, no hospitals.
We have to get him to the doc.

646
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:55,088
Needs a hospital.

647
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,391
Listen, the hospital
will call the cops.

648
00:47:57,424 --> 00:48:00,260
Now go to Winter and Harding,
behind the metal shop.

649
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,030
Carlos, check his pockets.
Got anything on?

650
00:48:04,365 --> 00:48:06,267
-You got anything?
-Nothing.

651
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:08,169
Manuel, I told you
to keep it simple.

652
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:10,238
Why'd you have to go mess up
like this? Now you're shot!

653
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,742
Yeah, I know, it hurts.
I know. It's okay.

654
00:48:13,774 --> 00:48:15,175
I'm gonna get you
to the doctor.

655
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:17,111
Don't you... Don't you
think about dying on me.

656
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,879
Don't you die!
Don't you die!

657
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:20,748
What are you
looking at? Drive!

658
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:22,149
It's okay.

659
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:35,496
Hey! You're not going to tell
anybody about this, right?

660
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,930
-No.
-Okay.

661
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:38,266
Seriously, don't
tell the cops.

662
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:40,001
You know, you're good, right?

663
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:42,403
We didn't hurt you
or nothing. Okay?

664
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:44,472
Good. I owe you one.

665
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,708
What do you mean, a drug dealer got
shot and bled all over your back seat?

666
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,612
Trud, why didn't
you wake me up?

667
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,849
-Did you call the police?
-No.

668
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,386
Okay, one had a gun and made me
promise not to tell the police.

669
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,755
Threatened
you with a gun?

670
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,025
Trud! Stop!
Talk to me.

671
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:37,041
I was so scared.

672
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,282
I never had a gun
pointed at me before.

673
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,018
Let's go inside, okay?

674
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:49,954
Have you had
anything you eat?

675
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,957
No? I'll make
breakfast, all right?

676
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,325
Okay. -Let's go inside. We'll
worry about this later.

677
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:08,239
I didn't sleep
at all last night.

678
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,641
I bet.

679
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,014
Look, I really don't
want to tell the police.

680
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,282
Why not?

681
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,384
I just don't.

682
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,086
Trud, had
a gun to your head.

683
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,255
I honestly don't think
Juan was going to hurt me.

684
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,159
And I kind of bonded.

685
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:33,163
You bonded with
a gang banger?

686
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,299
They could've
killed you.

687
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:39,036
Those guys are criminals.
They need to be put behind bars.

688
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,005
They're only trying to survive
the only way they know how.

689
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,809
I mean, do you really want to clog the
courts with a couple of dope dealers

690
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,376
when there are serial
rapists out there?

691
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,235
-Howdy, stranger!
-Hey, hey!

692
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,304
Trudy! -How'd you know I
was in the neighborhood?

693
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:15,406
I didn't. I didn't.

694
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:16,806
I guess
it's my lucky day.

695
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,242
Get in.

696
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,782
So?
What's going on this evening?

697
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,119
Just meeting some
clients for some drinks.

698
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,923
I got an idea.

699
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,224
Why don't you join me?

700
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,228
-With your clients?
-Yeah.

701
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,262
Well, they're clients,
but they're friends of mine.

702
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,266
It actually sounds
like a lot of fun.

703
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,902
I wish I could.

704
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,438
Come on. What time's
your shift end?

705
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,438
Late.

706
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:51,442
What do you do,
by the way?

707
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,244
We kind of skipped over
this small talk last time.

708
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,079
Investment management.

709
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,781
Super dull.

710
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,483
But, pays the bills.

711
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,119
I imagine it pays
'em quite adequately.

712
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,487
Yeah, I suppose it does.

713
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,257
Look, why don't you call
whoever you have to call

714
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,259
and just tell 'em
you're clocking out.

715
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,968
You don't want to
bring your NetCar driver

716
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:10,927
to have drinks
with your clients.

717
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,996
But I do.
I do.

718
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,800
Wait, hold on.
Is that a smile?

719
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,135
That's a smile. Yeah.

720
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,571
Maybe you're finally turning the page
on the worst chapter of your life.

721
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,375
I actually just got
held up at gunpoint

722
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,210
to go pick up a drug dealing
gun-shot victim in an alley.

723
00:52:29,445 --> 00:52:30,514
Come on.

724
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:32,516
Are you kidding?

725
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,320
New chapter.

726
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,295
-Better.
-Yeah.

727
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,034
I'm sorry.

728
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,135
The last thing
you need right now

729
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,404
is an overly emotional woman
breaking down on you.

730
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,239
Yeah.

731
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:56,652
Kidding. I'm kidding.

732
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:58,352
Listen, no, there's no
where else I'd rather be

733
00:52:58,353 --> 00:53:00,143
than right here with
you right now.

734
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,445
Yeah, what about
your clients?

735
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,048
They can wait.

736
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:06,583
Do you want
to talk about it?

737
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:07,852
No!

738
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:09,920
No.

739
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,924
I don't want to trouble
you with my problems, okay?

740
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,027
You don't even know me.

741
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,930
Well, honestly, I'd like
to get to know you.

742
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,168
-Are you flirting with me?
-Yes.

743
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,236
Hard.

744
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,308
Sorry. Was that
inappropriately honest?

745
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,176
Yes.

746
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,945
Should I have denied that
I was flirting with you?

747
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:37,547
No.

748
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,951
Okay. Well, yeah. Honesty
is one of my faults.

749
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,253
I'm not sorry.

750
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,587
You shouldn't be.

751
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,490
It's refreshing.

752
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,628
It's not really the best
circumstance for flirting.

753
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:52,996
Well, that's not really your
call to make now, is it?

754
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:00,270
I'm damaged goods.

755
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,043
We're all damaged goods.

756
00:54:19,117 --> 00:54:21,119
Why didn't you
go out for drinks with him?

757
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:25,625
Is just some guy
I met in my NetCar. No.

758
00:54:25,657 --> 00:54:27,960
That is not the way
I want to meet somebody.

759
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:29,963
He's smart.

760
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:32,365
Attractive. Has money.

761
00:54:32,398 --> 00:54:34,367
I mean, what more
do you want?

762
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,035
I don't know.

763
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:38,137
I broke down. I mean...

764
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:42,140
I cried like a baby
and I don't even know him.

765
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:44,943
I guess I just want
a little more romance.

766
00:54:44,976 --> 00:54:47,346
I hate
feeling desperate.

767
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,217
That is so romantic!
Are you kidding me?

768
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:54,319
Look, stumbled
into my life twice.

769
00:54:54,352 --> 00:54:56,421
If it's meant to be...

770
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:57,890
'll stumble in again.

771
00:54:57,923 --> 00:55:00,427
That's a positive
way of thinking.

772
00:55:06,197 --> 00:55:08,500
Gretchen. Gretch!

773
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:10,135
Holy crap!

774
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:11,237
Is that him?

775
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,473
Here. Write this down.

776
00:55:14,506 --> 00:55:17,276
-Ready? Mass plate... Are you ready?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

777
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:18,610
Go. Go.

778
00:55:18,644 --> 00:55:22,148
1-4-8-N-K-3.

779
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,383
N-K-3. Got it.

780
00:55:25,952 --> 00:55:27,520
I mean, should we
call the cops?

781
00:55:27,552 --> 00:55:29,554
Not, yet. Hasn't
done anything.

782
00:55:29,588 --> 00:55:31,323
I mean it might be
a legit NetCar.

783
00:55:32,425 --> 00:55:35,294
I mean, what do you want to do? You
just want to sit here and wait

784
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:37,262
to see if maybe
rapes someone?

785
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:39,564
Well, hopefully we can call the
cops before something happens,

786
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:42,001
but yes, okay, we need to
find something incriminating.

787
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,219
Gretch! Gretch! Gretch!
Wake up! Wake up!

788
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,354
-My gosh, what?
-Look, look, look.

789
00:56:03,356 --> 00:56:04,424
She just requested
a NetCar.

790
00:56:05,523 --> 00:56:06,926
How do you know?

791
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:11,597
Do you think's monitoring
the NetCar system, too?

792
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:17,037
I imagine it's possible.

793
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:29,548
My gosh, look,
he's pulling up.

794
00:56:40,026 --> 00:56:41,695
He's not a NetCar.
He's not on the GPS.

795
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:45,465
What do you
want to do?

796
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,202
We're gonna follow him.

797
00:56:50,535 --> 00:56:52,037
-My gosh.
-Put your seatbelt on.

798
00:56:53,305 --> 00:56:55,675
Don't you think
we should call the cops?

799
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:00,112
Trudy?

800
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:30,442
Well, now you have
something to report.

801
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,467
My God.

802
00:57:54,499 --> 00:57:56,135
What?

803
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:57,771
It's him.

804
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:03,208
-Who?
-Donovan.

805
00:58:04,476 --> 00:58:05,577
Donovan?

806
00:58:10,682 --> 00:58:11,717
Jackson.

807
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:13,218
-Trudy...
-I...

808
00:58:14,753 --> 00:58:15,789
Trudy, are you there?

809
00:58:17,222 --> 00:58:20,258
Give it. Hi. Hi,
I'm Trudy's roommate.

810
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,194
Look, we're at the
Slumber Haven Motel.

811
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,530
He's here. He's got another
girl with him.

812
00:58:25,564 --> 00:58:27,533
Wait, slow down.
What is your name?

813
00:58:27,566 --> 00:58:30,436
My name is Gretchen Healy.
I am Trudy's roommate.

814
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:31,637
Is Trudy there
with you?

815
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:33,539
-Yeah.
-Is she okay?

816
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:37,410
Yeah, she's fine. I'm fine. We're
in the car. We followed him here.

817
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:39,445
Okay, do not
go in there.

818
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:41,847
Stay away from the motel.
I'll send a unit right over.

819
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,548
Okay. Okay.
Thank you.

820
00:58:43,581 --> 00:58:45,350
-They're on their way.
-Was in my car.

821
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:47,787
Was in my car!

822
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,323
Gave me coffee.
Had to know it was me.

823
00:58:50,356 --> 00:58:51,724
Maybe didn't.

824
00:58:51,756 --> 00:58:53,525
God, I'm so stupid.

825
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:54,660
God!

826
00:58:54,693 --> 00:58:56,328
-I thought I liked him.
-Hey, hey, hey.

827
00:58:56,362 --> 00:58:57,786
You were smart, okay?

828
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,398
You followed your instinct.
You didn't have drinks with him.

829
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:00,499
But I wanted to!

830
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:02,200
Do not do this to yourself.

831
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:03,369
God!

832
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:08,775
What is...

833
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:14,680
Hold on.

834
00:59:26,592 --> 00:59:28,760
God, she's wasted.

835
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:30,395
Let me see.
Let me see.

836
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:51,417
I need to help her.

837
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:55,287
-The cops are on their way.
-We gotta get her out of there.

838
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,722
Detective Jackson said
to wait in the car.

839
00:59:57,755 --> 00:59:59,791
No, I don't care. Okay?

840
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,200
Just a second.
Hang on!

841
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:09,601
Police. Open up please.

842
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,508
Hey, sorry,
I was just in the shower.

843
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:20,278
-Are you alone?
-Yeah.

844
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:23,415
Why? -We're investigating
a possible kidnapping.

845
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:26,351
We got a report of suspicious
activity here at the motel.

846
01:00:26,385 --> 01:00:28,421
Mind if we take
a look around?

847
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:31,256
I'm pretty sure you need a warrant, but
no, you know, help yourself. Go ahead.

848
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,293
You...

849
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:35,994
notice anything
out of the ordinary?

850
01:00:36,028 --> 01:00:37,530
Like what?

851
01:00:37,563 --> 01:00:39,831
Loud guests.
Screaming, arguing?

852
01:00:39,865 --> 01:00:41,567
No.

853
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,435
It's been a pretty
quiet night actually.

854
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:49,241
All right.

855
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:50,443
Thank you for your time.

856
01:00:50,476 --> 01:00:52,510
-Of course.
-Good night.

857
01:00:52,543 --> 01:00:53,746
Night.

858
01:01:11,796 --> 01:01:16,034
You two put yourselves into a
very dangerous situation tonight.

859
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:18,704
I sat with him right
here in this diner.

860
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:20,104
Has ridden in my car.

861
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:23,742
But can you positively identify him
from the night of your assault.

862
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:24,844
God dammit, no!

863
01:01:27,733 --> 01:01:29,401
Do you recognize this man?

864
01:01:31,469 --> 01:01:33,504
No.

865
01:01:33,538 --> 01:01:34,738
It's an artist's sketch
based on the motel

866
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:36,876
clerk's description
of your assailant.

867
01:01:36,907 --> 01:01:39,243
-That doesn't make any sense. Wasn't...
-This...

868
01:01:39,277 --> 01:01:41,379
is our best lead right now.

869
01:01:41,413 --> 01:01:43,148
Where was the girl?

870
01:01:43,181 --> 01:01:45,583
Trudy, you know the law.

871
01:01:45,616 --> 01:01:49,053
There was absolutely nothing wrong
in that motel room tonight.

872
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:50,989
Nothing suspicious.

873
01:01:51,022 --> 01:01:53,191
No victim. No arrest.

874
01:01:53,225 --> 01:01:56,194
We saw him
take her in there.

875
01:01:56,228 --> 01:01:57,763
But you can't
identify him.

876
01:01:57,795 --> 01:02:01,567
And the man in that motel room doesn't
even remotely resemble this drawing.

877
01:02:02,935 --> 01:02:04,436
I need you two
to back off

878
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:06,572
and let us do
our police work.

879
01:02:06,605 --> 01:02:09,007
You have no idea
what I've been through.

880
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,475
I can't just sit
around and wait.

881
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:14,446
Unfortunately...

882
01:02:14,478 --> 01:02:16,181
I do know what
you've been through.

883
01:02:17,382 --> 01:02:18,951
I've been
through it myself.

884
01:02:23,554 --> 01:02:25,223
This is a victim's advocate.

885
01:02:25,257 --> 01:02:26,928
She works with social
services and I think

886
01:02:26,929 --> 01:02:28,561
she could be a big
help to you right now.

887
01:02:29,594 --> 01:02:31,600
She'll help you navigate
this system and give

888
01:02:31,601 --> 01:02:33,432
you some place to
vent your frustrations.

889
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:37,969
In the meantime,
you need to go home.

890
01:02:39,004 --> 01:02:40,306
Let me do my job.

891
01:02:43,975 --> 01:02:45,277
We're gonna get his guy.

892
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:59,057
We're not going home.

893
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:07,298
What is
still doing in there?

894
01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:09,335
Probably sleeping.

895
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:13,072
Trud, it's 4:00 in the morning.

896
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:15,975
He's not our guy.
Can we please just go?

897
01:03:16,007 --> 01:03:18,176
No. He's not sleeping.

898
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:21,546
Then what is doing?

899
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,549
-She's not even in there.
-Yeah, where did she go?

900
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:25,650
She has to be. We saw
him bring her in there.

901
01:03:27,185 --> 01:03:28,654
I don't know.
Maybe got...

902
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:30,556
adjoining rooms
or something.

903
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:31,590
Look.

904
01:03:40,665 --> 01:03:42,201
Duck. Duck. Duck.

905
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:43,634
-Put your seatbelt on.
-My gosh. What's happening?

906
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,070
Just duck.

907
01:04:14,533 --> 01:04:16,101
What are you doing?

908
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,506
I'm so confused.

909
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:57,610
I'll come
talk to her later.

910
01:04:58,877 --> 01:05:00,279
Let's let her
sleep it off.

911
01:05:37,214 --> 01:05:38,449
-What are you doing here?
-Hi.

912
01:05:38,482 --> 01:05:39,784
My name is Trudy O'Donnell.

913
01:05:39,817 --> 01:05:43,755
I'm not selling anything. I think
we had similar experiences.

914
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:47,125
What are you
talking about?

915
01:05:48,192 --> 01:05:50,261
A couple of weeks ago
I got into a black NetCar

916
01:05:50,295 --> 01:05:51,563
and I was raped
by my driver.

917
01:05:52,596 --> 01:05:54,332
Do you remember how
you got home last night?

918
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:56,467
What?

919
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,437
What? I think you
better go away.

920
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:00,738
-No, no, no. Please, just...
-Go or I'll call the police.

921
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:02,808
Let me talk, please.
Please? Okay?

922
01:06:02,841 --> 01:06:04,109
I just want to help.

923
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:06,478
I know who the man was, and I
don't think assaulted you.

924
01:06:08,413 --> 01:06:10,516
Well, how did
you find me?

925
01:06:11,616 --> 01:06:12,851
I followed you home
from the motel.

926
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,821
What motel?

927
01:06:18,589 --> 01:06:22,428
How much do you... know about
what happened... last night?

928
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:32,703
Okay, just...
Let me get dressed.

929
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:33,739
Okay.

930
01:06:38,909 --> 01:06:43,516
Do you feel like you've been...
sexually assaulted?

931
01:06:44,683 --> 01:06:46,418
I mean, do you feel
like you've had sex?

932
01:06:47,618 --> 01:06:48,887
No.

933
01:06:50,455 --> 01:06:51,556
I don't think so.

934
01:06:53,491 --> 01:06:55,494
I think I would know.

935
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,196
Good. Good. That's
what I thought.

936
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:00,900
He's too smart to go
through with it.

937
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:03,701
My God.

938
01:07:06,003 --> 01:07:08,406
-What the hell happened?
-It's not your fault.

939
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,342
He's not a NetCar driver.

940
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:14,812
Just pulls up in a nice black car
and we unsuspectingly get in.

941
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,283
And raped you?

942
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:19,584
Yes.

943
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:21,820
My God.

944
01:07:21,852 --> 01:07:23,422
I have to go
to the police.

945
01:07:23,454 --> 01:07:25,457
Would you?

946
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:27,492
I was hoping
you'd say that.

947
01:07:27,525 --> 01:07:29,228
This could really
help my case.

948
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:30,462
Yeah. Of course.

949
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:33,464
I'm so sorry.

950
01:07:39,303 --> 01:07:40,471
Donovan.

951
01:07:45,576 --> 01:07:47,646
Thank you for coming in.

952
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:52,484
Am I under arrest?

953
01:07:53,517 --> 01:07:55,020
No.

954
01:07:55,052 --> 01:07:57,890
I just wanted to talk to you about what
happened at the motel the other night.

955
01:08:00,357 --> 01:08:03,695
Okay, well, then you're aware that I'm
here completely at my own prerogative.

956
01:08:03,727 --> 01:08:05,297
And I can leave
at any time.

957
01:08:06,964 --> 01:08:08,833
I'm not accusing
you of anything.

958
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:12,704
I just wanted to tell you
what we know

959
01:08:12,736 --> 01:08:15,373
and see if maybe you could
fill in a few holes for us.

960
01:08:19,543 --> 01:08:23,167
We have a witness that
saw you pickup Elise Steele

961
01:08:23,168 --> 01:08:24,949
in front of the Paladium
last Friday night.

962
01:08:26,551 --> 01:08:28,821
Did you know Miss Steele before
she got into your vehicle?

963
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:39,397
We also know that she had Rohypnol
in her system the following day.

964
01:08:42,866 --> 01:08:45,904
That same witness...

965
01:08:45,936 --> 01:08:50,675
saw you drop Miss Steele off in front
of her home just a few hours later.

966
01:08:53,445 --> 01:08:54,846
Please...

967
01:08:54,878 --> 01:08:58,049
I'm just asking for a
little cooperation here.

968
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:01,687
Listen, detective...

969
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:02,954
I know my rights.

970
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:05,591
I know how
this works.

971
01:09:06,691 --> 01:09:08,327
I don't mean to be obstinate...

972
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,531
but I'd prefer to share
any information I do

973
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:16,034
or do not know
in a court of law.

974
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:18,303
If and when
that should occur.

975
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:21,073
And by the way...

976
01:09:22,507 --> 01:09:25,509
your officer who didn't
have a warrant

977
01:09:25,543 --> 01:09:27,313
did a completely illegal
search of my premises...

978
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:29,880
and I'll press
charges if I need to.

979
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:34,953
Okay then.

980
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:37,455
I'm going to leave now.

981
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:44,096
And thank you for your service
to our community, detective.

982
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:06,084
Hi, Trudy.

983
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,755
What are you doing here?

984
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:11,990
I was in the neighborhood.

985
01:10:16,694 --> 01:10:18,397
How do you know
where I live?

986
01:10:26,771 --> 01:10:29,908
Let's not play games here
with each other, Trudy.

987
01:10:29,941 --> 01:10:31,810
I know you followed me
to the motel.

988
01:10:33,945 --> 01:10:35,514
-May I come in?
-No.

989
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:38,016
I don't want you to.

990
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:39,918
Why would you
follow me?

991
01:10:41,652 --> 01:10:42,920
I don't know what
you're talking about.

992
01:10:42,954 --> 01:10:44,123
No, I think you do.

993
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:49,026
You're afraid of me,
aren't you?

994
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:51,897
You should be.

995
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:55,500
-I'll scream.
-No, you won't.

996
01:10:57,668 --> 01:10:58,736
You know...

997
01:11:00,538 --> 01:11:02,141
I really thought that
we had a connection.

998
01:11:03,173 --> 01:11:04,575
I felt it.

999
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:05,777
Didn't you?

1000
01:11:10,013 --> 01:11:13,217
You have nothing.
Do you understand?

1001
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:15,020
Nothing.

1002
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:16,487
It's your word
against mine.

1003
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,125
You don't have a shred
of real evidence, so...

1004
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:22,227
unless you want to live
your life in fear...

1005
01:11:22,259 --> 01:11:24,762
how about you get off this little
vigilante crusade of yours...

1006
01:11:25,797 --> 01:11:27,766
and just go back to living
your pretty little life.

1007
01:11:36,007 --> 01:11:37,709
Stop.

1008
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:39,011
Stop.

1009
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,112
Go ahead!

1010
01:11:42,146 --> 01:11:43,782
Scream.

1011
01:12:03,312 --> 01:12:04,580
What the hell happened?

1012
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:06,716
-Was here.
-Who?

1013
01:12:06,749 --> 01:12:08,552
Donovan.
Saw us at the motel.

1014
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:10,386
My God, did hurt you?

1015
01:12:10,419 --> 01:12:11,788
No.

1016
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,422
But I know
it was him.

1017
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:16,192
Are you sure? You're not just
wanting him to be the guy?

1018
01:12:16,226 --> 01:12:17,594
No, I'm sure.

1019
01:12:17,627 --> 01:12:18,527
It has to be.

1020
01:12:18,561 --> 01:12:20,729
Okay, you need
to call Detective Jackson.

1021
01:12:20,762 --> 01:12:23,165
So she can tell me the
same thing you just did?

1022
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,735
That I'm projecting
my memories...

1023
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:29,238
that the witness' sketch doesn't
even match his description.

1024
01:12:29,271 --> 01:12:31,408
That damn motel clerk.

1025
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:32,843
Yeah, I did a little
research on him.

1026
01:12:34,276 --> 01:12:35,544
Several arrests.

1027
01:12:35,578 --> 01:12:37,815
Did a little time for B&E
and cocaine possession.

1028
01:12:39,315 --> 01:12:40,884
Maybe's working
with Donovan.

1029
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:42,319
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

1030
01:12:44,753 --> 01:12:46,089
I have a plan.

1031
01:12:47,222 --> 01:12:48,524
But I'm going to need your help.

1032
01:12:50,226 --> 01:12:52,462
Only if you're willing.

1033
01:13:18,288 --> 01:13:19,857
-Hello?
-Okay, He's in place.

1034
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,391
Take a shot for courage.

1035
01:13:23,593 --> 01:13:24,861
Okay.

1036
01:13:24,893 --> 01:13:25,896
Love your guts.

1037
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:27,431
Love you more.

1038
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:35,338
Can I have a shot
of bourbon, please?

1039
01:14:47,543 --> 01:14:48,512
Okay, we're on route.

1040
01:14:49,579 --> 01:14:52,249
Remember the crime scene.
Do not leave a trace.

1041
01:15:05,061 --> 01:15:06,663
I have some water
back there if you want.

1042
01:15:09,065 --> 01:15:10,433
Thank you.

1043
01:15:41,563 --> 01:15:42,798
You all right back there?

1044
01:15:44,334 --> 01:15:45,469
Yeah.

1045
01:15:46,535 --> 01:15:48,739
Yeah, I'm just sleepy.

1046
01:15:50,906 --> 01:15:52,441
You know what they say...

1047
01:15:53,743 --> 01:15:55,645
water's the best thing for you.

1048
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:56,779
Yeah.

1049
01:17:02,044 --> 01:17:03,780
-How're you doing?
-Good.

1050
01:17:03,812 --> 01:17:05,515
-Can I get a room?
-Yeah.

1051
01:17:06,716 --> 01:17:07,950
45 bucks for the night.

1052
01:17:07,984 --> 01:17:10,053
I'll need you to fill in
these out for me.

1053
01:17:16,558 --> 01:17:17,761
Hey, where the hell
is Green Street?

1054
01:17:19,061 --> 01:17:20,764
It's, downtown.

1055
01:17:20,797 --> 01:17:22,031
Canal district.

1056
01:17:22,063 --> 01:17:25,000
Okay, yeah.

1057
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:30,973
How long does it
take him to get here?

1058
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:35,445
This time of night, probably
about 15 to 20 minutes.

1059
01:17:35,477 --> 01:17:38,815
Okay. Thank you.

1060
01:17:40,048 --> 01:17:41,851
Car trouble.

1061
01:17:46,088 --> 01:17:47,490
So we all good here or what?

1062
01:17:47,522 --> 01:17:48,891
Yeah.

1063
01:17:48,924 --> 01:17:51,713
Listen to me, this is
the last goddamn time.

1064
01:17:55,527 --> 01:17:56,868
Hey, mira.

1065
01:17:58,234 --> 01:17:59,468
Here we go.

1066
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:04,947
So, Manuel's on his
way, but it's going

1067
01:18:04,948 --> 01:18:06,166
to take him like 20
minutes to get here.

1068
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:08,011
The guy inside, says's coming
down Canal District way.

1069
01:18:12,481 --> 01:18:13,716
Come on.

1070
01:18:19,688 --> 01:18:21,825
Had too much to drink.

1071
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:36,505
Come on.

1072
01:18:51,253 --> 01:18:52,821
I got a picture

1073
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:54,790
of you taking $200
from that douchebag.

1074
01:18:57,259 --> 01:18:59,128
Now...

1075
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,696
I know what you did.

1076
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:03,232
So why don't you
give me the master key

1077
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:04,768
and I won't tell
the cops what I know.

1078
01:19:06,869 --> 01:19:08,103
Whatever you want, bro.

1079
01:19:26,722 --> 01:19:28,224
Hey.

1080
01:19:28,257 --> 01:19:31,027
Why don't you go have a
chat with your boy Roger?

1081
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:34,897
Carlos and me, we've
got some work to do.

1082
01:19:34,931 --> 01:19:36,165
Thanks, Juan.

1083
01:19:38,734 --> 01:19:40,770
Hey, Trudy.

1084
01:19:40,802 --> 01:19:43,005
I told you,
I owe you one.

1085
01:19:52,615 --> 01:19:55,151
Hello, Roger. I'm Trudy.
Remember me?

1086
01:19:55,183 --> 01:19:56,919
Why don't you tell me
about that sketch?

1087
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,763
What the hell?
Where did go?

1088
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:09,165
Check the bathroom.
Check the bathroom.

1089
01:20:20,977 --> 01:20:22,112
It's locked.

1090
01:20:37,192 --> 01:20:38,695
What the hell?

1091
01:20:38,727 --> 01:20:40,596
Hey, who are you?

1092
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:41,797
Drop it. Drop it.

1093
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:43,999
Just the wrong room, man.
Just the wrong room.

1094
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:45,301
Call the police.

1095
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:46,736
Easy, man. Easy, easy.

1096
01:20:46,768 --> 01:20:48,103
I checked. This is the
wrong room. I know.

1097
01:20:48,137 --> 01:20:50,707
But Roger, told me
to come down to 105.

1098
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,609
You know, that's it.
That's all I was doing.

1099
01:20:52,642 --> 01:20:53,184
Shut up.

1100
01:20:53,185 --> 01:20:54,811
Hey, what's going on in
there? Hey, is she okay?

1101
01:20:54,843 --> 01:20:56,212
Yeah. She's fine.

1102
01:20:56,244 --> 01:20:57,646
All right, looks like...

1103
01:21:00,016 --> 01:21:01,150
Get off her!

1104
01:21:01,182 --> 01:21:02,752
Hey, get off her.

1105
01:21:02,785 --> 01:21:04,187
Get off her!

1106
01:21:04,219 --> 01:21:05,621
Get up!

1107
01:21:05,655 --> 01:21:07,290
-What took you so long?
-I'm sorry.

1108
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:08,892
What took you so long?

1109
01:21:09,892 --> 01:21:12,729
They're brothers.
They're brothers.

1110
01:21:12,762 --> 01:21:14,097
They're freaking brothers!

1111
01:21:16,731 --> 01:21:18,266
Take off the mask!

1112
01:21:18,299 --> 01:21:19,768
Take it off!

1113
01:21:26,409 --> 01:21:27,777
Hi, Trudy.

1114
01:21:33,915 --> 01:21:35,217
You're brothers?

1115
01:21:36,718 --> 01:21:39,021
-Trudy...
-How could you?

1116
01:21:41,723 --> 01:21:43,426
I trusted you.

1117
01:21:43,459 --> 01:21:45,061
God, I cared about you.

1118
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:47,929
You violated me!

1119
01:21:47,963 --> 01:21:49,199
You breached me!

1120
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:57,907
I'm going to make sure that they put
you away for a long, long time.

1121
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:01,076
But you know they won't.

1122
01:22:02,244 --> 01:22:03,380
I'll see you in five years?

1123
01:22:04,746 --> 01:22:06,249
Free on good behavior.

1124
01:22:08,484 --> 01:22:09,886
I'll be waiting.

1125
01:22:16,758 --> 01:22:18,895
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.

1126
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:20,963
I'm sorry.

1127
01:22:29,003 --> 01:22:30,972
You won't believe
what they said.

1128
01:22:31,005 --> 01:22:32,208
When they thought
I was unconscious.

1129
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,676
Don't tell me.
Don't.

1130
01:22:34,944 --> 01:22:37,179
All I know is I got
in the wrong car that night.

1131
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:41,817
Okay, well. We're going to stick to the
plan. You have to get out of here.

1132
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:43,753
Okay. You have
the pepper spray?

1133
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:44,788
Yeah.

1134
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:46,990
I guess it came in handy.

1135
01:22:48,223 --> 01:22:49,324
Okay.

1136
01:22:51,326 --> 01:22:53,029
I love your guts.

1137
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:54,363
I love you more.

1138
01:22:55,364 --> 01:22:56,433
You got the DNA sample?

1139
01:23:00,069 --> 01:23:01,838
That's my girl.
