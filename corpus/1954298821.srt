1
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:36,527
I can't believe you have
done this to my husband.

2
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,790
- I'm truly sorry, Mrs Block.
- Sorry?

3
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:47,714
- You made him look like a clown!
- I was stunned as you are, Mrs Block.

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,074
This will have consequence, Mr Tovar.

5
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,493
You will see.

6
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:46,023
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph called.
- Good morning, Mr Tovar.

7
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:51,320
You made Mr Block look like a punk.
What were you thinking?

8
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,531
I was trying to make him look nice.

9
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,327
- I'm sorry?
- Younger, maybe.

10
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:03,290
Mr. Block wasn't young,
wasn't nice, he wasn't skinny.

11
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:07,127
And painting his face up
ain't gonna change that.

12
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,714
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:15,928
Our job is to make the
deceased look good for the families.

14
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,056
Now I got a lot on my mind right now,

15
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,142
and you're not making things easier.

16
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,800
<i> The first eye witness
accounts of this grisly development</i>

17
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:48,919
<i>came from people who were understandably
striking and almost incoherent ...</i>

18
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,713
- Aunt Lou?
- Good morning, Junior.

19
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,559
- You got a minute?
- Always for you, Junior.

20
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,596
Aunt Lou, I'll tell you.
I've just about had it with that girl.

21
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,350
- Service didn't go well?
- No, it did not.

22
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,829
DyeAnne cosmetized
the body for viewing.

23
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,272
I thought she was ready.

24
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,649
Needless to say, Mrs Block
was none too pleased.

25
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:14,611
- Three strikes?
- Well ... Yeah.

26
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,319
Alright, I'll give DyeAnne
her 2 weeks notice.

27
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,673
You just pretend like
you don't know anything.

28
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,955
- Just got too much on my mind right now.
- Of course you do.

29
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,529
Thank you.

30
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:29,655
Oh, got the Del Amos
waiting in your office.

31
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:34,002
And I set up an interview with a really
nice young woman looking for a job.

32
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:38,594
- Two appointments this morning?
- Junior, she's a mortuary school graduate.

33
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,556
You really should meet her.
Real nice, smart.

34
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:46,313
I know she can't replace
Bobby Kimball, but ...

35
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:50,523
if you get along with her,
she could do Bobby's work.

36
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,293
- An institute?
- That's right.  Graduated from P.I.M.S.

37
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,831
You didn't say anything
about salary, did you?

38
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,846
Okay.
No more appointments this week, right?

39
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,207
The computer says ...

40
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,009
No ...

41
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,220
I gotta go check on
something.  I'll be right back.

42
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,657
Just give the Del Amos ... some
more copy of a magazine or something.

43
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,776
- Well, you know I will.
- Thank you.

44
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,965
<i>- ... over there and then we'll be
able to give a more definite view.</i>

45
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,042
<i>Thank you very much, Chief McHullond.</i>

46
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,320
<i>This is Bill Cardill,
WIIC, Teville Avenue.</i>

47
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,258
- Good morning, Gerald.
- Morning, Russ.

48
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,994
I'm just getting started here.

49
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:03,645
I can see that.
Russ, who's car is that?

50
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,221
Oh, yeah.  I was going to
tell you.  This guy came by ...

51
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,621
What guy?

52
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,730
Werner Gottshok, State Inspector
Division of Funeral Cemetery.

53
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,407
Russ, did this Gottshok
guy say anything?

54
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,532
He just handed me his card
since there was no one around.

55
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,461
And you just let him?

56
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:21,877
He seems real official.

57
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:24,340
I don't know, I thought you were
expecting him or something.

58
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,120
- I mean, he's from the state.
- Where did he go?

59
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,707
- The cemetery, the old hill, I think.
- Oh hell!

60
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,377
Russ, keep that cage locked!

61
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,923
I will keep it locked, Gerald.

62
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,627
Thing is, now I sometimes
gonna walk out of here.

63
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,494
Help me.
Help me.

64
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,723
I'm sorry, Mr Gottshok.
I truly am.

65
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,435
- What?
- I didn't mean it to be this way.

66
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:15,287
Russ, well I told you!
No deliveries right now.

67
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,831
Okay, stop, stop, stop!

68
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:19,185
Find the guy?

69
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,449
Yeah, I found the guy.
That's all taken care of.

70
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,724
No deliveries from them,
until further notice.

71
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:24,813
But they're with that company.

72
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,046
I know what company they're with.
You just go tell 'em.

73
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,808
Okay, I'll tell 'em.

74
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,088
I don't know.  He doesn't
want you here right now.

75
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:45,450
- What's with the bloody shovel?
- What?

76
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:47,126
Bloody shovel.
Why are you ...?

77
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:51,365
Gophers.  Forget about the
damn shovel will you, Russ.

78
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,068
- Have you left that door open today?
- What?

79
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,130
- No.
- Big boy.

80
00:08:57,231 --> 00:09:00,321
Yes, for a couple of minutes.
I went inside to get some water.

81
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,656
- Shit!
- What?

82
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:05,837
Shit!
That door locked now?

83
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,515
- Yes
- Give me the keys.

84
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,350
What is the big deal?

85
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,636
It couldn't have been opened
for more than a couple of minutes.

86
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:30,946
Morning, folks.  I'm Gerald Tovar,
your new Funeral Director.

87
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,666
Francis Del Amo.

88
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,264
- My wife, Honey.
- Well, that's a sweet name.

89
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:42,583
- It's nice to meet you, Mr Tovar.
- How are you folks this morning?

90
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,379
Can't complain.

91
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,612
I'm sorry.  There's
no smoking in here.

92
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,949
Right.

93
00:09:57,184 --> 00:10:00,252
So, what can Tovar & Son
Mortuary do for you?

94
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:06,298
Dad's in a nursing home, and
they said it could be any time now.

95
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:10,360
- So we thought we should make a plan.
- Ahh, funeral package.

96
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,014
We have a few to choose from.

97
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:15,887
If you like, later we can
look at the casket selection.

98
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,896
We have mainly half couches,

99
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:22,153
steel, fiberglass, wood.
I like a nice oak myself.

100
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,044
Well, we don't exactly
know what Dad wants.

101
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:31,298
But he has always
been very ... frugal.

102
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,592
Cheap.

103
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,178
Nice.  Well.

104
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,792
I don't necessary
recommend it, Mrs Del Amo

105
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:42,675
but our most economical
model is a cloth cover casket.

106
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:45,312
We call it the "minimum casket".

107
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,857
Basically, fiberboard
covered with black felt.

108
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,194
Dignified, very affordable.

109
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,583
Mr. Tovar, since dad
never really talked about it,

110
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,662
and now we can't express his wishes

111
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,082
We were thinking ...

112
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,252
Cremation.

113
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,446
I see.

114
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,057
<i>- Did I frighten you?
-  No, it wasn't you.</i>

115
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:27,354
<i> Something happened back on the road
there.  We stopped and speak to some men.</i>

116
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,733
<i> Oh, the driver told us they weren't
men at all, but said they were corpses.</i>

117
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,934
- So, Christine.
- Ah, Cristie.

118
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:39,743
Alright, Cristie.  I see you
got references.  That's good.

119
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:44,421
If you don't mind me asking Mr Tovar,
where did you get your mortuary training?

120
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:47,767
Right here.
On the job, with my daddy.

121
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:52,396
I didn't really plan on anything.
It just sort of work out that way.

122
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:56,016
So you took over the family
business here from your father?

123
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:01,305
Yeah.  Daddy worked with bodies with
his daddy back in the Czech home town.

124
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,444
Can't really pronounce the name.
I'm the first Tovar born over here.

125
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,652
And this is the only
mortuary in Hinzmanville?

126
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:14,221
Yeah.  We got the corner of
the market.  One-stop shop.

127
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:21,825
Look at the ... We can start you out
as an apprentice, if you want the job.

128
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,020
- I do, thank you!
- Can you start today?

129
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,540
- Sure, I can start right now.
- Good.

130
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,260
Things ain't fancy
here, but they'll do.

131
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,100
Of course, I'm gonna have to
supervise your work at first.

132
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,401
Of course.

133
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:39,377
You also offer cremations
here, don't you?

134
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:44,864
You know ...  We don't
do too much of that.

135
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,027
But we got an oven.

136
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,480
I'll take you over to Aunt Lou.

137
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:53,212
She'll tell you what your salary will
be.  Pay is low to start, but it's fair.

138
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:54,792
Lou will get you a set of keys.

139
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:58,732
Certain rooms are off limits for
right now, so you won't have those.

140
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,660
Thank you, Mr Tovar.

141
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,463
Call me Gerald.

142
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,938
That's your cold room.

143
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,198
Follow me.

144
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:23,929
<i>-  ... the men who steal these corpses.
-  Why do you drive like that you fool ...</i>

145
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:27,474
<i> worse is that could have been.
We might have been caught.</i>

146
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,935
DyeAnne ...

147
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:35,991
I want you to meet Christine ...
Cristie Forrest.

148
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,089
Hi, I'm DyeAnne.

149
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,995
Hi.  Nice to meet you.
Cristie.  Diane?

150
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,682
DyeAnne, with a Y and a E.

151
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:57,838
DyeAnne here has been with us for
about three months.  She's still training.

152
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,027
Not ready for
embalming work just yet.

153
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:03,927
You two can get to know each
other as you work on Mr Hadley.

154
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,910
I've got to go check on something.

155
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,889
DyeAnne, you show
Cristie where everything is.

156
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,261
Okay.

157
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,825
So once we wash the body,
we massage the muscles.

158
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,012
Makes it feel like more
easy prep for embalming.

159
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,566
I heard he took meths.

160
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,577
OD'd.

161
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:40,756
Well, they all get the same
respect once they get to us.

162
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,459
Go ahead and work on
the bicep a little bit more.

163
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,265
I know how to break with her.

164
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

165
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:19,904
Well wait.  Gerald didn't tell
me where you went to school.

166
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:27,386
Junior still wants to
say a goodbye to me.

167
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,146
Junior?

168
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:33,016
I don't even
know why I plan this.

169
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,261
I was told it sucks.

170
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:38,989
You mean late nights, fresh calls?

171
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,802
No!  I love working alone.

172
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,747
Late at night.

173
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:55,639
For the rest of the time,
during the day with people.

174
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,359
Hey, Dye ...

175
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:42,729
Oh, whoa.  I am sorry.
I thought you were DyeAnne.

176
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:48,302
- No it's okay.  I'm Cristie.
- This is Cristie Forrest.

177
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:52,197
The new assistant Funeral Director.

178
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,973
You make it sound so
formal.  I just starting.

179
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,748
That's nice to meet you.
Have you seen Gerald around?

180
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,341
I know where he is.

181
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,961
- Ah so, later DyeAnne.
- I'll text you.

182
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,641
Nice to meet you, Cristie.

183
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,902
- Aunt Lou?
- The prodigal brother returns.

184
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,814
Gerald.

185
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,308
Harold.

186
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:47,579
- Guess I'm supposed to be surprised.
- Wow.

187
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,982
You look different.

188
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:52,650
Did you lose some weight?

189
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:00,476
Well, I guess I'll leave
you two boys alone.

190
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,246
Especially you got a
lot of catching up to do.

191
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:09,151
Nice to see you again, Aunt Louise.

192
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,213
So ...

193
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:17,451
You kept locking the crematorium now?

194
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,045
We got some issues in there.

195
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,806
Guess we need to talk.

196
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:28,562
<i>Can I just add that, Gerta, it seems God
poured his bucket of rich natural resources</i>

197
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:33,984
<i>down here on the heartland so that ....</i>

198
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:38,530
<i>and in the hands of the great down to
earth patriots who value hard work</i>

199
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,535
- What's on the tube, Lou?
- Oh, about Sister Sara.

200
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,084
Sister Sara?  Really?

201
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:51,485
<i>that has been forgotten on our own
doorstep here.  As we all know on ...</i>

202
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,507
- Did you talk to DyeAnne yet?
- Not yet, Junior.  You know I will.

203
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:59,927
Can you turn that up?
She is tremendous.

204
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:08,644
<i>...patriotic Americans.  Well Gerta, I of
course, infuriate those who would say</i>

205
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:12,900
<i>that because the former
Vice President lacks a pulse in there</i>

206
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:19,700
<i>that makes him as the main stream
media is so very fond of saying</i>

207
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:21,740
<i>one of the walking dead</i>

208
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:26,509
<i>or a zombie, also.</i>

209
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,885
Do you smell it?

210
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,825
- Smell what?
- The whiff of cook.

211
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,639
Just got a little stronger in here.

212
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:42,594
- Aunt Lou, do you understand that woman?
- T bonics.

213
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:46,431
Okay, fine.  You can laugh all you want.
Mark my words, that woman

214
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,175
is the face of the new movement.

215
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,593
Become a teabagger, have you?

216
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:55,290
You do know what
"teabagging" is, don't you?

217
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:58,527
That is an inappropriate term.

218
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,904
Now Gerald ...

219
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:06,278
Well, guess everyone loves
their own kind of misery.

220
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,836
America!

221
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,680
<i>... here to tell 'em
we're no longer listening.</i>

222
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,926
<i>This is what happens when the
Constitution starts shaking her fist.</i>

223
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,348
No one comes around here.
It's off limits.

224
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,908
He never touched this one!

225
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:48,119
What?

226
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,401
He ain't touched this shit.

227
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:51,990
He hasn't touched this since he died.

228
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:56,735
No.  I come in here every now
and then just to be by myself.

229
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,849
Is it still in there?

230
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,643
Daddy's broom handle?

231
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:23,687
- That brings back some memories.
- Daddy let you play with it, biddy?

232
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,374
- Yeah.
- Now, now Harold.

233
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:30,990
This is not a toy.
This is worse than money.

234
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:43,073
I remember this too.
Dad's old mini-fridge.

235
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,202
Well, I don't think there's
anything in there you want.

236
00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:48,743
Huh.  You want to wet
my whistle.  I'm not picky.

237
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,953
I'm just not buying.

238
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,274
- What have we found?
- Go ahead and take it.

239
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,197
It's not diet.

240
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,376
You're right.  It's not.

241
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,122
It's kind of ... but it's still good.

242
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,932
You got that dull useless
look about you, Harold.

243
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:40,756
Look, it's nice to see
you again too, Gerald.

244
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:48,238
What brings you back?  You're tired of
treating the doggies and the kitty cats?

245
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,168
No.

246
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,087
No, I ...

247
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,803
I closed the veterinary clinic.

248
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,420
Oh?

249
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:04,969
I had to.

250
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,175
I need money, Gerald.

251
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,483
Okay, Harold.

252
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:21,021
No. No, no ...

253
00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:25,817
Real money.

254
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,784
Well, little brother.

255
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:32,241
You got all your money in tin foil
if you think I got any money.

256
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,157
No look, Gerald.

257
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:41,291
You inherited the mortuary, the house,
the real estate that it's sitting on

258
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,773
not to mention the farmhouse.
I need money.

259
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:49,816
And I will challenge
the will, if I have to.

260
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:52,427
You gonna start that
shit again, are you?

261
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,492
I haven't seen you in ten
years and you come in here ...

262
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,798
You didn't even come to daddy's funeral.

263
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,795
I was in a bad place.

264
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:05,983
What makes you think I'd give a half Tovar
like you any money, even if I had any?

265
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,910
Damn it, Harold.

266
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,938
I'm sorry.

267
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:22,058
Listen, you caught
me at a real bad time.

268
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,578
We're still brothers and all.
Nothing's changed there.

269
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,977
Why don't you let
me make it up to you.

270
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:32,943
Come on down to the old place tonight,
I'll fix you supper.  We'll talk about it.

271
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:36,271
You fix me supper?

272
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:47,091
Unless you'd rather fish something
out of that old mini-fridge.

273
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,369
That's a close one.

274
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,802
That settles it then.

275
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:57,601
Be back here at 7 tonight.
We'll drive out together.

276
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,570
Alright, brother.

277
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,958
Alright.

278
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,202
Okay if I come in for a second?

279
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:42,118
Well, you're kind of already in,
Russ.   What's on your mind?

280
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:45,955
The door.  It was only open for
five minutes.  I swear to God.

281
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,302
I believe you, Russ.

282
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:54,424
Listen, I got a lot
on my mind lately.

283
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,054
Oven room's broken,
just hired a new girl.

284
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,500
Work's backing up.

285
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,394
You might have noticed
a little odour creeping out.

286
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:07,092
Yeah.

287
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:13,193
Well, let's just keep that between
you and me for now.  You with me?

288
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:17,177
Sure, ... but the

289
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:21,885
crematorium ...
Doesn't this work at all?

290
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:27,166
Well, let's just say the fire
doesn't work for me, Russ.

291
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,588
- Okay.
- Say Russell?

292
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:37,506
You got a brother, works over
at the Henry Cooper place, right?

293
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,054
Oh yeah.  That's my
twin brother, Owen.

294
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:42,331
He's kind of a slacker.

295
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,927
He has like a ponytail.
It's gross.

296
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,396
Alright.  Well.

297
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,861
Why don't you go on
and wash the cabbie.

298
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,318
- And say Russ!
- Yeah?

299
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:58,808
Don't forget your keys.

300
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:04,840
And stay out of that oven room
until further notice, you got me?

301
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:06,651
I got it.

302
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,303
You got everything laid out.
Disinfected?

303
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,415
Yes, Mr Tovar.

304
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,076
Smell like menthol.

305
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:38,349
My special cologne just for you.

306
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:44,798
It is always nice to look at the face of
somebody God took a little extra time on.

307
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:48,733
Too bad this ain't one of them.

308
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,170
Alright, let's get down to it.

309
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,881
You got all your tools here.  You got
your mouth formers in a box over there.

310
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,202
That's your eye caps.

311
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:02,626
Now if you run out or you can't
get the eyes to close just right

312
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:07,765
use superglue.  All trick to the trade.
- I did not know that.

313
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,016
Closing mouth, I don't have
one of them fancy injector guns,

314
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:14,148
just good old fashion
needle and string.

315
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,441
I actually have my own injector gun.

316
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:24,032
Well, that's fine, if
you know how to use it.

317
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:26,497
And by the looks of it, you do.

318
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:31,181
Ahh, trocar.

319
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,142
My daddy calls it
the embalmer's spear.

320
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,349
You always want to be careful
when inserting a trocar,

321
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,232
especially if the departed
appears to be gassy.

322
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:45,694
That's one more reason
we wear our face shields.

323
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:48,741
Oh yeah.

324
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,655
I have something to attend to.
- DyeAnne you help Cristie.

325
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,886
Cristie, you go and set the features.
I'll be right back.

326
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,358
Come on!

327
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,385
- Dad's T87?
- Yup.

328
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,139
- Get in.
- What did you do?

329
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,551
What didn't I do?

330
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:25,704
That's daddy.

331
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:33,875
Take your time.
I'll be in the house.

332
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:23,307
- You remember where the dining room is?
- Yeah.

333
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,440
Hello?

334
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:27,049
Hey, Mr Tovar.

335
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:29,269
Okay.

336
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:32,893
Okay.

337
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:38,793
Yes, we understand.

338
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,643
Shit!

339
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,555
What?
Is that Gerald?

340
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:51,962
Junior.

341
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:57,472
Got tied up.  Wants us to go
ahead and embalm the body.

342
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,648
We'll check your work later.

343
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,234
I'm supposed to be your assistant.

344
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,830
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

345
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:14,507
I think I knew this dude.

346
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:19,859
Yeah, I bought grass from this
guy once.  What happened to him?

347
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:21,478
I'm sure he died.

348
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,329
Die with ... or what?

349
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,476
- We gonna take care of this guy first.
- Right now?

350
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,789
You mean embalm Mr Hadley.

351
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:39,304
I think wait around
for a bit and come back.

352
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:45,419
Oh no, I'm cool.  I was on top of
all this when Bobby was here.

353
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:50,883
- Alright, but don't stay too close.
- He's not going to bite.

354
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,144
Yeah, it actually takes like
a whole lot to make me sick.

355
00:35:56,323 --> 00:36:00,635
<i>WHNZ news time 8 o'clock.
In local news, for you fans of Sister Sara</i>

356
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:03,562
<i>the new book tour make a stop
tomorrow at the Hinzmanville Mall</i>

357
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:06,120
<i>where she'll be signing her
new book "Getting In There".</i>

358
00:36:06,753 --> 00:36:08,523
Well, that's enough of that.

359
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,871
Hope you don't mind
drinking a beer with your eggs.

360
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:19,813
Coffee would have been preferable.

361
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:27,637
I'm out of coffee.  There is not a
whole lot else in the house.  I'm sorry.

362
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,876
For water running I get cold water.

363
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:35,779
- Bottled water?
- Just regular tap water.

364
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,349
No!

365
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,956
I never drink tap water.

366
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,292
Afraid of what's in it?

367
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:48,751
You think fluoride is the only
thing they put in the water?

368
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,081
Perfect paranoia,

369
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,808
is perfect preparedness.

370
00:36:58,286 --> 00:37:01,854
Well, what suits you,
don't usually suit me.

371
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,398
That's the way it's been, ain't it?

372
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,747
Yup.

373
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,324
Something like that.

374
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,708
So ...

375
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:22,450
You really haven't done a
thing with this house, have you?

376
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:27,755
Look around, little brother.
This is your million dollar show place!

377
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,505
Just can't get pass it.

378
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:01,615
Dad's death.
Yes, I know.

379
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,480
He's everywhere I look.

380
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:11,999
I just wasn't ready for it.
It's been 30 years in that place with him.

381
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,063
Maybe it's better
you just sell it, Gerald.

382
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,424
Whatever in the
house, just let it go.

383
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:24,487
- It's like dad.
- Live in the here and now.

384
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:31,220
The here and now sitting in front of
me, wants money.  Demands money.

385
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:33,457
But I don't much care.

386
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,099
I got big problems.

387
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:41,628
The oven in the crematorium?
Just get it fixed.

388
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:47,084
Ain't that simple.  Give me that
beer if you ain't gonna drink it.

389
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:52,007
Well.  I'm here now.

390
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:53,720
Let your brother help.

391
00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:01,307
- You think you want to know my problems?
- Absolutely.

392
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:04,850
Like shit, I'll tell you.

393
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,656
It was a good idea to take a break.

394
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:25,486
I thought you'll chill up with
like beer or something.

395
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,243
This is a good idea.

396
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:33,561
- This is good stuff.
- Yeah.

397
00:39:49,706 --> 00:39:50,936
Zombies?

398
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:55,013
I didn't call them that.  You did.
I don't know nothing about zombies.

399
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,770
Okay.

400
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,906
Wait.
Let's get this straight.

401
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,045
So you're telling me ...

402
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:07,526
That there are corpses
at the mortuary ...

403
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,082
and they're moving ...?

404
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:13,956
At the crematorium.
Yeah, they're moving.

405
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,992
Some of them are getting up.

406
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,605
Okay.  Alright.

407
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:24,727
So, let me ask you.

408
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,117
Do they move fast
or do they move slow?

409
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,847
Are they shamblers
or are they sprinters?

410
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,710
Well, they move real slow,
Harold.  They are dead.

411
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,033
Romero zombies.

412
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:46,777
Okay.

413
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:48,408
Well.

414
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:58,479
- I believe I will have that beer now.
- No, no, no.  I'll get it.

415
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,790
You stay put.

416
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:14,868
<i>You have reached the law offices
of Boyle, Snyder and Wright.</i>

417
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:17,949
<i>If you know your party's
extension, press it now.</i>

418
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,876
Hey Dan, it's Harold.

419
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:28,063
Listen.  I think I have what we
need to deal with my brother.

420
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:31,154
I want you to look into
mental incompetence,

421
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,918
and I will call you at
the office in the morning.

422
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:35,975
Thank you.
Bye.

423
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:30,226
Why didn't you say that
you went to school there?

424
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:31,227
I didn't.

425
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:34,938
She's a necro.

426
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,590
What?

427
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:43,069
- What is that?
- I like dead people.

428
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,023
You mean ... like sex?

429
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:58,472
Don't be silly.
No, not like that.

430
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:01,994
That is awesome!

431
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,084
Jesus, Gerald!

432
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,836
How could this have
even gotten started?

433
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:22,472
Daddy had a side business going for
years.  Government deal medical waste.

434
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,158
Federal government?

435
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:30,344
Daddy would accept stuff they didn't
want to report.  So, they rolled on in.

436
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:34,818
He just burned whatever they
brought along that paid him cash.

437
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:36,354
Really?

438
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:46,467
Shit storm started about
a couple of weeks ago.

439
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:50,871
That company delivered
a real thick body bag.

440
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,344
Okay.

441
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:57,584
And?

442
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:11,712
Well, I have heard about incidents
like this, as a matter of fact.

443
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:16,793
- Government.  CRAC.
- Crack?

444
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:21,114
- This ain't about drugs, Harold.
- No, no, no ...

445
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,596
It is an anachronism, Gerald.

446
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:28,705
Initials.  C.R.A.C stands for ...

447
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:34,158
Corpse Re-Animation Cover-up.  Don't you
read "The Grudge Report"?   Cover-ups.

448
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:40,259
Socialist-run internment camps.
Area 51, that ring a bell to you?

449
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:43,078
Jesus.  And ...

450
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:48,715
Zombie operation.
Pittsburgh in 1968 and then '78.

451
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:53,240
And Louisville in 1985 and
again in Pittsburgh in 1990.

452
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:58,122
They say that one is very similar to
the outbreak in '68 only more gory.

453
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:01,321
Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.

454
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:05,160
That is where it all started.
According to the "Grudge Report"

455
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:08,563
That city is the zombie
capital of the world.

456
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:12,294
And Hinzmanville
is not that far away.

457
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,976
How do you know
so much about this shit?

458
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:19,339
- From the internet, so it must be true.
- Jesus, Harold.

459
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:23,469
Even I know you can't believe
everything you read on the internet.

460
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:25,485
I mean, let me ask you something.

461
00:47:26,286 --> 00:47:29,216
Will you hear this about everything
on the internet being true.

462
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,694
On the internet?

463
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,530
So, what?  You think
I'm a drunk or a crazy?

464
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:38,997
Oh, no, no, no.

465
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:40,761
- Yeah.
- No.

466
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,617
Well, I'll show you.

467
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:50,054
Cristie?
Hey, you okay, Cristie?

468
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,217
- Are you okay?
- I told you we should have told her.

469
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:58,529
You've done E before, right?

470
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:02,678
E?

471
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:04,904
Ecstasy.

472
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,731
Russell's second income.

473
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:12,267
Hey. You cool, you cool ....

474
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,898
You should chill out for a little bit.

475
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:26,240
You don't believe me?  We'll go
over to the mortuary right now.

476
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:31,025
Come on, Gerald, it's late!
You've been drinking, you can't drive.

477
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:35,142
- You can drive a stick shift, can't you?
- Of course. Yes.

478
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:39,728
Here you go.  When we get over
there we'll both sober up real quick.

479
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:42,691
Alright fine.  But we're
stopping to get coffee.

480
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:46,976
I want you at least a little sober
so this isn't a total waste of time.

481
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,093
Close that.

482
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:12,869
Oh, my God!

483
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,311
Oh, God!

484
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:23,738
This.  Put a dab under your nose.

485
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:31,369
Oh, my God.

486
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:37,280
Gerald!  There must a
hundred bodies in here.

487
00:49:37,287 --> 00:49:40,147
I figured you are a 2nd
Amendment kind of guy.

488
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,957
- I'll stick to my shovel.
- A shotgun?

489
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,780
You gave me a shotgun.
What are we walking into here?

490
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:50,383
You stay right behind me now.

491
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:54,543
If you trying shock them on
me, mission accomplished.

492
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:58,043
- Be careful.  That thing is loaded.
- Right.  Right.

493
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,601
Oh, my God!

494
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:08,372
Help me.

495
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:11,845
Harold!

496
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:17,605
What is this?

497
00:50:18,419 --> 00:50:21,491
You remember that Tea Bag
or express bus accident?

498
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:24,190
Happened a few days ago,
you probably heard about it.

499
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:27,605
I did.  I had no idea
they were brought here.

500
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:32,721
Oh, no.
These are good Americans.

501
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:36,568
The guru, Dirk Ermey, was at the wheel.
Drove them all right into a ditch.

502
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:37,973
Oh no.

503
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:44,390
They started coming back
to life about two weeks ago.

504
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:47,716
A few days before that,
the company brought up this

505
00:50:47,717 --> 00:50:50,346
new protective light body bag.

506
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:54,905
There was something real strange,
real corrosive in that bag.

507
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:59,117
Daddy accepted everything they
brought in, put it in the fire real quick.

508
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,805
But you didn't do that.

509
00:51:04,548 --> 00:51:06,388
There was something special in them.

510
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,473
Gerald!

511
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:14,674
What?

512
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:25,894
Gerald, why didn't you just burn
these bodies and get rid of them?

513
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:29,339
- The fire.
- What?

514
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:31,380
You weren't around,
so you wouldn't know.

515
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:34,278
Daddy always handle
the cremation himself.

516
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,355
I couldn't even help him.

517
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:39,541
I tried.

518
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,995
But I never could.

519
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:47,183
Okay, so you ... just

520
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,161
took the bodies and the money.

521
00:51:53,397 --> 00:51:56,825
- This was never about money.
- Okay.

522
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:59,760
When daddy passed, I just kind
of lost it for a couple of weeks,

523
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:01,896
and a couple of weeks
became a couple of months.

524
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:05,397
And then you know,
things just pile up on you.

525
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,379
I guess I'm what some people call ...

526
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,722
- ... procrastinator.
- Right.

527
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:18,261
Anyway, come on over here.

528
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:38,628
What the ...

529
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:41,041
... fuck is this?

530
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:43,985
Bobby Kimball.

531
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:49,346
Why is he up there like that?

532
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:53,889
Bobby's special.
Like the son I never had.

533
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,779
Worked with me here for years.

534
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:01,100
When the time came, I was
going to give everything to him.

535
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:06,687
But that all got shot to shit when
he got torn in half by an 18 wheeler.

536
00:53:07,112 --> 00:53:09,318
Like you see him now.

537
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,096
But ...

538
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:16,053
Why is he tied up like that?

539
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:21,266
When the others
came back, I figured ...

540
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:27,541
Maybe if I tied him up,
I can control him.

541
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:31,240
- If he came back.
- Gerald, he's dead.

542
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:33,584
Back from the dead.

543
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,179
See when they come back,
they come back real slow.

544
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,185
- Slow?
- Umm.

545
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:46,003
So slow, you can hardly notice it.

546
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,901
I thought I was going crazy.

547
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:55,603
And the I borrowed that
video cam of my girl DyeAnne.

548
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:59,907
Recorded all night.
But the taping didn't see nothing.

549
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,674
No movement.

550
00:54:07,464 --> 00:54:10,429
It wasn't until I accidentally
hit the fast forward button,

551
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,457
that I saw one of them move.

552
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:26,308
So I had time to deal with
my little corpse problem.

553
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:29,803
I just had to keep an eye on
things, get them under control.

554
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:34,297
Late at night, I fired up the
chainsaw and de-animate them.

555
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:52,501
Gerald, that sounds like a good creepy
story but you have to listen to yourself.

556
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:56,463
You sound like a crazy person.
And frankly all I see here ...

557
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,287
are a bunch of mutilated bodies,

558
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:01,009
that should have been burned
or buried a long time ago.

559
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:05,781
God damn it!  I show you all this
and you fucking don't believe me.

560
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:06,845
Oh Gerald.

561
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:09,967
Pick up the camera right over
there.  Come on, I'll show you.

562
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:25,244
Battery is dead.

563
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,936
We'll go to my office.
I got more tapes in there.

564
00:55:29,937 --> 00:55:32,133
No, no, no. No!

565
00:55:32,168 --> 00:55:35,478
I'm done.
I've had quite enough!

566
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:39,718
It's been a long night.
I'm going to my motel.

567
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:47,681
Your shotgun.

568
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,849
Jesus, Gerald!

569
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:04,531
Shit!  Never a god damned
zombie around when you need one.

570
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:07,657
Junior!  Are you in here?

571
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:11,305
Junior?  Junior?

572
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,500
- Aunt Lou?
- Oh, Lord!  What a stink!

573
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:18,345
What are you doing here so late,
dear?  You shouldn't be in here.

574
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:21,732
I forgot my purse.  I was on
the way back from the casino.

575
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:25,476
I drove all the way out there for
nothing.  Can you imagine that?

576
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:30,018
So anyway, I came back, and I
thought I heard voices in here so I ...

577
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:32,830
Junior ...

578
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,008
What's going on in here?

579
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,839
All these bodies like ...

580
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:53,925
Aunt Lou!

581
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,066
Aunt Lou!

582
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:06,828
Oh, sweetheart.

583
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,385
I'm so sorry.

584
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:16,812
Now, come on here.
Come on.

585
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,178
Come on, dear.

586
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:31,337
We gonna take care
of you over here, well.

587
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:34,916
We'll set you down
on the old couch.

588
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:38,272
Ah, you gonna be good as new.

589
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:42,964
Lay on down here.
There you go

590
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:46,684
- Now, feeling better?
- Oh, Junior.

591
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:49,333
I don't understand Junior.

592
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:52,999
I have bit real bad.

593
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:55,791
What was that thing?

594
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:58,656
Was this something like
some sort of crazy person?

595
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:05,740
Shouldn't we be going to a hospital?
Why aren't we going to a hospital?

596
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:09,295
I can't take you to a hospital Lou.

597
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:14,299
I'm pretty sure they couldn't
do anything for you anyway.

598
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,531
And I sure as hell know
they wouldn't understand.

599
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:22,703
What understand?

600
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:27,910
Are you saying that
the thing killed me?

601
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:34,973
Just lay your head back now.

602
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:39,575
Close your eyes.
Rest.

603
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,140
I'll be back in a while.

604
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:47,081
Then everything'll be ...

605
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:50,872
just he way it's supposed to be.

606
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:54,730
You get some rest now, Lou.

607
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:08,393
Why is this all happening now, Dad?

608
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:15,450
I tried to do everything
just like you wanted.

609
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:46,931
Aunt Lou?

610
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,999
- Up here.
- Gotcha.

611
01:01:56,634 --> 01:02:01,296
Oh, my.  This is where you
bring the deceased, Dee Dee?

612
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:05,044
I told you it's DyeAnne.

613
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:10,155
Well, I have to tell you, I'm not a
big fan of being around the dead.

614
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,480
Now about the living,
making a difference.

615
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:17,460
But I do want to thank you both
for getting me a giving me a ride

616
01:02:17,462 --> 01:02:22,034
while the limo man
waits for the um ...

617
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,063
Ah, tow truck is the word
that you're looking for.

618
01:02:25,629 --> 01:02:28,788
Do you have a
Purell and a Diet Coke?

619
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:35,596
- Excuse me, a Diet Coke?
- Let me go check.

620
01:02:36,014 --> 01:02:39,144
Thanks honey, you're a sweetie.
And a bendy straw.

621
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:42,863
Oh, my God!  There's
something wrong with Aunt Lou!

622
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:44,607
What's happening?

623
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:46,308
Oh, fuck!

624
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:50,346
Shit!

625
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:53,829
Oh, no, no.
Fuck.  Fuck that!

626
01:02:55,734 --> 01:02:58,845
- Somebody help her!
- Come with me.  Here.

627
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:01,321
Fuck that!

628
01:03:03,826 --> 01:03:05,459
God.  What is she doing?

629
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,396
What the hell's wrong with her?
She looks like she's fucking dead.

630
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:10,579
- I don't know!
- Hey, hey, hey, get the fuck back!

631
01:03:10,983 --> 01:03:12,484
We've got to stop her!

632
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,159
Russell!  Here, use this!

633
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,470
- Be careful!
- You be careful.

634
01:03:23,471 --> 01:03:26,336
I'm a little busy right now!

635
01:03:41,638 --> 01:03:44,362
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck?

636
01:03:51,473 --> 01:03:56,478
Oh, why the heck would that
crazy lady in there attack me?

637
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:58,739
Everybody likes me.

638
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:00,427
Aunt Lou?

639
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,879
No idea.

640
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:11,526
It almost like seeing
a movie of zombie.

641
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,263
I mean that's what they look like.

642
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:20,152
Well, I don't get it, DyeAnne,
watch those kind of movies.

643
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:22,104
Too morbid.

644
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:28,302
Well, I'm kind of like, dizzy there.

645
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:33,874
In the movies,
they are like animals, yes?

646
01:04:35,918 --> 01:04:37,856
And they could eat brains.

647
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,555
I'm sorry, what did you say there?

648
01:04:42,634 --> 01:04:46,506
About what the ghouls crave?

649
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:48,911
Brains.

650
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,717
Brains?

651
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:53,235
Oh!

652
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,153
- Oh, god.
- Oh, Christ, DyeAnne!

653
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:07,837
- What the hell is happening?
- I don't see her anywhere.

654
01:06:07,872 --> 01:06:09,122
Crazy bitch killed her.

655
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,941
Look, I don't know
what's going on but

656
01:06:10,942 --> 01:06:12,770
we need to find her and
we need to lock her up.

657
01:06:12,905 --> 01:06:17,260
The crematorium.  I have the keys.
It's got the strongest door.

658
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,276
Whatever it is we can put it in there.

659
01:06:19,277 --> 01:06:22,363
That'll be the safest places.  I've got
to put a bunch of stiffs in there.

660
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:24,260
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

661
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:02,890
It was meant to be.

662
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:08,853
When he came back, I knew.

663
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:11,530
You ...

664
01:07:12,691 --> 01:07:15,768
You ... dug Dad up?

665
01:07:16,445 --> 01:07:19,490
Daddy came back fast
after I gave him the taste.

666
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:24,519
Faster than the others.
Some of them took days.

667
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:27,853
You see, I knew there was a reason
I wasn't supposed to burn them.

668
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:31,376
He had it in his will to be
cremated, but I didn't do it.

669
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:34,327
I brought him up here to be with me.

670
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:36,325
And now he's back.

671
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:40,602
You dug dad up

672
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:44,822
and you gave him some of
that fluid from the bank?

673
01:07:44,928 --> 01:07:46,445
Life's blood.

674
01:07:56,793 --> 01:08:00,279
- Dad, it's Harold.
- I wouldn't get too close.

675
01:08:13,744 --> 01:08:15,038
Gerald ...

676
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:20,092
I didn't before,
but I believe you now.

677
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:26,817
- Seeing is believing, Harold.
- But it doesn't solve your problem!

678
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:31,595
What are you going to do with
all the others at the mortuary?

679
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:35,190
This is serious, Gerald.

680
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:39,156
People are in danger.  What
about Aunt Lou?  She's family!

681
01:08:40,954 --> 01:08:43,897
No.  She got bitten.

682
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:47,813
- Pretty sure she's zombiefied by now.
- What?

683
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:51,614
Gerald!

684
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,031
My, God!

685
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:58,168
What have you done?

686
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,550
What are we going to do?

687
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:08,037
I brought daddy back, Harold.

688
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:11,324
Right now, everything
else is kind of foggy.

689
01:09:11,325 --> 01:09:12,785
Okay, okay, okay.

690
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,912
Okay, okay, okay.

691
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:19,022
Clear heads prevail.

692
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,160
Okay.

693
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,025
I think that we can keep
the authorities out of this

694
01:09:27,026 --> 01:09:30,272
and we won't burn them, Gerald.

695
01:09:30,307 --> 01:09:34,613
But we've got to keep that crematorium
locked.  Do you understand me?

696
01:09:35,184 --> 01:09:38,321
Locked and locked tight.
And then ...

697
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:44,614
We go green.
- What are you talking about, Harold?

698
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:50,739
Maggots!  Maggots, Gerald.
I know where I can get a lot of maggots!

699
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:52,396
I will help you.

700
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:58,187
I will help you.
But not for free.

701
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:02,303
I have to get something in return.

702
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:09,136
Daddy old briefcase.

703
01:10:10,652 --> 01:10:13,710
And there's $30,000 in there.
That's all I got.

704
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:24,490
That's a start but it's not enough.

705
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,815
What do you want?

706
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:36,540
Gerald, what do you know
about tissue harvesting?

707
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:44,015
Human body is worth $200,000

708
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:48,848
when it's divided up and sold to
companies who buy human tissue.

709
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:52,493
Here's the beauty.
You get rid of your problem,

710
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:56,690
and you go into the tissue
harvesting business with me.

711
01:10:56,773 --> 01:10:58,464
Tissue harvesting?

712
01:10:58,465 --> 01:11:02,265
Yes, the maggots get rid of the
bodies that are too far gone ...

713
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,615
... and we take what
we want from the rest,

714
01:11:06,618 --> 01:11:09,414
and the new clients who come up.

715
01:11:09,494 --> 01:11:13,415
Bones, Gerald are very valuable.

716
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:20,300
Before the funeral, we are going to
have to replace the bones with ...

717
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:25,404
Now ... just thinking
of the top ... PVC pipe.

718
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:27,318
Whose gotta know?

719
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:30,681
And you want to do
that out of my mortuary?

720
01:11:30,682 --> 01:11:32,419
Sure, chump.

721
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:37,215
That's a question!  I want no
part in disrespecting the dead.

722
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:42,753
Gerald!  That's what
you have been doing!

723
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:46,148
Protecting daddy's legacy
is what I'm doing!

724
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:51,102
I'm no grave robbing tissue grabber!

725
01:12:02,038 --> 01:12:03,774
Poppa!

726
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:25,267
Well little brother, you
won't be coming back again.

727
01:12:25,762 --> 01:12:31,208
I'd like to help you, but I'm afraid
there's no cure for that bite.

728
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:34,054
This is a good spot for you.

729
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:38,884
With family.
At home.

730
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,045
Gerald, pick up!

731
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,438
DyeAnne.

732
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:19,354
Cristie?

733
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:22,492
Now is not a good time.

734
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:25,538
What?

735
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:29,910
Oh Jesus.
Calm down.  Calm down.

736
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:34,710
Alright.  Listen, stay put.
I'll be there as quick as I can.

737
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:57,215
Look here, Cristie, I know this
probably ain't the right time.

738
01:13:57,316 --> 01:13:59,482
But there ain't no right time.

739
01:13:59,857 --> 01:14:03,094
- We got to deal with DyeAnne.
- What do you mean?

740
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:07,882
- She's coming back.
- She's coming back?

741
01:14:10,242 --> 01:14:11,627
Like Aunt Lou?

742
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:14,935
Yeah, like that.

743
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:19,138
When you called, you said you
and Russ were attacked by some

744
01:14:19,139 --> 01:14:21,609
frothing at the mouth
crazy bitch, right?

745
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:26,458
Well, same thing is
going to happen to her.

746
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:29,995
What you gonna do?

747
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:36,849
This ain't DyeAnne any more.

748
01:14:39,963 --> 01:14:43,342
I want you to get out of here and go
on in the other room.  Don't come back.

749
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:48,282
Go on.

750
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:27,199
Holy hell.

751
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:32,108
- She didn't deserve that.
- We have to go get Russell.

752
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:37,971
Get Russel.  I though you said he got
pulled into the oven room.  He's dead.

753
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:39,499
We don't know that he's dead.

754
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:44,800
Don't you even care?

755
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:47,943
Of course I care.
Russel didn't deserved it either.

756
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,447
Don't you want to even try?

757
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:52,835
If I thought there was half a chance,
you know, I'd go in there and get him.

758
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,576
You think there's a chance?

759
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:07,081
- Ever used a gun?
- No.

760
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,892
Well, you pull the trigger.

761
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:20,430
Alright.  We are gonna
go into the back here.

762
01:16:20,497 --> 01:16:23,542
I'm thinking most of them will be up
near the front where they grabbed Russ.

763
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:28,530
- Why did you have this cage installed?
- For security.

764
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:31,817
Why would have a metal cage in front
of the back door of a crematorium?

765
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:35,629
- Keep your voice down.
- What happened here?

766
01:16:35,664 --> 01:16:38,020
That's gonna have to be
a story for another time.

767
01:16:38,557 --> 01:16:40,581
Let's just go get Russ.

768
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,361
Stay right beside me.

769
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:57,978
- Oh Jesus!
- Stay focused on what's ahead.

770
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:01,196
Breathe through
your mouth if you can.

771
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:06,499
Use that and make sure
you aim for the forehead.

772
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:15,076
Oh, God!

773
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:33,223
- I don't see Russell.
- Me neither.

774
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:42,462
- Gerald.
- Oh, God.  That's him?

775
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:51,149
- He's still alive.
- Cristie, that ain't him.

776
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:58,286
- He's just a corpse in Russell's.
- What?

777
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:00,780
He'd been dead for too long.
You can tell by the corpse.

778
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:07,062
Seems like his mind is trying to,
hang on but that ain't Russ.

779
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:09,596
Another word here,
I can't watch him like that.

780
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:11,398
What you gonna do?

781
01:18:11,499 --> 01:18:14,776
Open each one.  Then we
gonna get the hell out of here.

782
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,196
Gerald, look!

783
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,776
Cristie shoot that thing!

784
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:11,278
Shoot her!  Cristie!

785
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:55,340
Cristie!

786
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,426
Cristie, where are you?

787
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:04,388
<i>Get off, get off me ... Now.  Shit.</i>

788
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:08,345
God damn it, Bobby!
Get off of her!

789
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:13,897
Get out of here, Cristie!
Go on.

790
01:20:13,922 --> 01:20:15,257
I'll be right behind you!

791
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:02,821
Come on inside.
I'll fix you up.

792
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:04,346
Come on.

793
01:21:17,428 --> 01:21:19,371
Here you are.
Gonna sit you down.

794
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:40,152
You're in shock, Cristie.

795
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:43,193
You need to get some fluids in you.

796
01:21:45,989 --> 01:21:47,318
Thank you, Gerald.

797
01:21:49,368 --> 01:21:50,848
Here you go.

798
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:55,652
Drink this.  It's warm and
it may not taste so good.

799
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,570
But it'll do the trick.

800
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:02,989
- What is it?
- It's one of them energy drinks.

801
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:10,894
- Red Bull or Monster?
- Something like that.

802
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:20,849
Go on, drink it.  It will make you
feel like a new woman, I promise.

803
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:01,518
What did you give me?

804
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,601
You poisoned me!

805
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:17,758
Not poison, Cristie.
Life's blood.

806
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:20,884
- You'll see.
- No!

807
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:26,596
You're special.
Wasn't no accident you came here to me.

808
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:28,812
I can see that now.

809
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:40,642
When you come back,
I'll take care of you.

810
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:08,181
Don't you worry now.

811
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:11,025
I'll be right back.
