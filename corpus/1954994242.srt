00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:30,122
Hey.

3
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:32,906
This is the part where you say,

4
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,242
"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."

5
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:38,635
Yes.

6
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:43,050
How long since your last confession?

7
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:45,931
I've, actually, uh...

8
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:49,290
I've never had a confession before.

9
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:51,721
You've never had the
Sacrament of Reconciliation?

10
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:55,241
No, I've never had any sacraments

11
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,258
that I can think of,
not that I can remember.

12
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,531
I mean, I may have had one by accident.

13
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,450
To tell you the truth, I
actually never even been

14
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,337
inside of one of these, or
like a church or anything,

15
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,802
but there was a funeral... I'm sorry.

16
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,466
I didn't know who else to talk to.

17
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:13,515
You're the deputy from that Oswalt thing.

18
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,842
Well... I'm not on the force anymore.

19
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:19,562
But you are him, right?

20
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,033
Yeah.

21
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,442
So...

22
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,650
if I... if I tell you something,

23
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:30,794
it stays between us, right, like lawyers?

24
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:33,641
Yeah, but I'm gonna ask
you not to tell me anything

25
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,746
that I can't unhear,
if you know what I mean.

26
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,147
Okay.

27
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,578
Do you believe in evil?

28
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,691
I mean, of course you do, you know.

29
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:47,114
You mean, do I believe in the supernatural?

30
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:50,378
Ghosts and demons, and the devil himself.

31
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,769
Something like that, yeah.

32
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:56,619
This is about your friend, your case.

33
00:04:58,474 --> 00:04:59,818
What did you find?

34
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,441
I don't know, I can't explain it.

35
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:05,066
It's something, uh...

36
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,202
otherworldly.

37
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,571
And you want to know how to stop it.

38
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,905
Yes.

39
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,889
What do you want me to say?

40
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:17,034
You should carry a cross and holy water,

41
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:20,619
and shout, "The power
of Christ compels you?"

42
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,378
Why, would that work?

43
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,297
No.

44
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,835
Right.

45
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,321
- You want my professional advice?
- Yes.

46
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:31,370
You don't stop evil.

47
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,185
You can only protect yourself from it.

48
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,106
Do I believe things that
you're talking about exist?

49
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:37,707
Yes.

50
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:41,226
And I believe they exist to
lure men like you into them.

51
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,170
Stay out of it, whatever it is.

52
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:50,283
Whatever happened to the Oswalts

53
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:51,690
is only gonna happen again.

54
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,617
It's a question of when and where.

55
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:30,665
Gotcha!

56
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:33,066
- What?
- You didn't make the noise. You didn't say the words.

57
00:06:33,097 --> 00:06:34,953
- No, I killed you.
- I shot you in the back.

58
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,746
- You're hit. I got you!
- Uh-uh.

59
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:38,697
No, I got you, I killed you!

60
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:40,298
You did not make the noise.

61
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:43,241
Boys. Boys!

62
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:45,578
Did you guys take those
out of their packages?

63
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:48,170
No. They were in a bin like this.

64
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,290
You're putting 'em back.

65
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,217
Pick out your cereal.

66
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:03,498
Dude, these are so much better than yours.

67
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,555
Yeah, but these are healthy.

68
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,801
You're supposed to pick sugar,

69
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,403
that's the whole point of cereal.

70
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,306
No, no. One box each.

71
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:17,929
- They all look so good.
- Can we get two each?

72
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:19,563
No.

73
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,922
You boys stay close, okay?

74
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:24,874
Okay.

75
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:47,626
What is it, Mom?

76
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:48,906
You boys remember what to do

77
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:50,730
when Mama says "rutabaga", right?

78
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,585
We run.

79
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:54,602
Yeah, and stay close together.

80
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,969
Rutabaga.

81
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:07,435
Rutabaga!

82
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:17,097
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey!

83
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,049
Wait, wait a minute. Slow down!

84
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,330
- Dylan!
- What's wrong?

85
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:23,179
That man back there just
touched one of my boys.

86
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,826
Hey, son. You need to step back.

87
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,555
What'd she tell you?

88
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:37,481
Seatbelts.

89
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:38,506
Yeah.

90
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,243
Yeah, it's her, all right.

91
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,187
Race you inside.

92
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:03,625
What?

93
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,442
Dylan?

94
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,937
You okay?

95
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,546
What is it?

96
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,330
Okay, well, I think I'm gonna
go finish up work for a bit.

97
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,186
You think you can make
dinner with your brother?

98
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,289
Okay.

99
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:31,082
Hey.

100
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:32,618
You did good today.

101
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:49,834
Yeah, hi, I'm calling
about the Jacobs property.

102
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:51,498
Yeah, I'm looking at the listing.

103
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,282
Uh, is it still available?

104
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,009
Oh, it is.

105
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,481
Okay. No, that's great.

106
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,417
My clients are gonna be
very, very happy about that.

107
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:05,097
Yes, they, um... they
are aware of the incident.

108
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:07,241
Yeah, their only question is

109
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,929
has anyone lived on
the property since then?

110
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,354
No one.

111
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,698
It's been vacant for that long?

112
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:21,130
Okay. No, no, I'll, um...

113
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:22,601
I'll let them know.

114
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,330
Okay, thanks.

115
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,337
Mom.

116
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,098
Yeah, sweetie?

117
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:56,681
- Dinner.
- Okay.

118
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,089
I'll be... I'll be there in a minute.

119
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,369
Dylan?

120
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,649
You okay, baby? What's wrong?

121
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,586
Nothing.

122
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,770
Hey, Dylan. It's just
an old building, baby.

123
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:27,273
I know.

124
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,890
How long are we gonna be out here?

125
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:42,986
Not long. I promise.

126
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,226
I'm worried about Dylan.

127
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:46,921
Why?

128
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,225
He's just...

129
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:50,761
different out here.

130
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,218
Yeah, well...

131
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:57,482
he'll come around. He will.

132
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,722
But he's gonna need a
little help from his brother.

133
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,409
Do you think you're up for it?

134
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,642
Good.

135
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,858
'Cause I really can't do this alone.

136
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,970
I need my boys.

137
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,018
Good night.

138
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,938
Sweet dreams.

139
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,729
- Hi, Milo.
- Hi, Dylan.

140
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,618
What are you doing here?

141
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,122
I have something to show you.

142
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,394
I'm supposed to be asleep.

143
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,593
Your mom just started working.

144
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:54,378
She'll be out there for hours.

145
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,041
What if she comes back?

146
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:59,177
She won't.

147
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:02,057
- How do you know?
- I just know.

148
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:04,585
Do you trust me?

149
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,353
What's down there?

150
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:27,145
You'll see.

151
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,394
It's back there.

152
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,122
Come on.

153
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:58,954
Should I open it?

154
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,209
What's on them?

155
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:17,866
There's only one way to find out.

156
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,417
How'd you know this was here?

157
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,649
This is where I left it.

158
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,521
Hey, Ted. What are you doing here?

159
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,498
Milo said he was gonna show you the thing.

160
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,978
This one's mine.

161
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,081
We shouldn't be watching this.

162
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:45,417
Turn it off, Milo. Let's get...

163
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,538
Shh.

164
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,776
What the hell?

165
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:06,666
Uh...

166
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:08,586
Mom!

167
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,282
Mom!

168
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,745
- Hey!
- Whoa, hold on, ma'am.

169
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:18,506
No, no, no. This is private property.

170
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,201
Wait, wait, wait! No, I was
told the house was for sale.

171
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:21,705
The listing said it was available.

172
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,528
Doesn't give you a right to be out here.

173
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,449
You're trespassing and you know
it. What are you doing here?

174
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,369
I'm a private investigator.

175
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,280
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- What?

176
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:33,002
- How the fuck did you find me?
- Hold on, what?

177
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:34,952
Was that your partner back
there at the grocery store?

178
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:36,393
Partner? No, I work alone.

179
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,409
You listen to me, okay? You listen to me.

180
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,330
- Okay.
- You are not taking them.

181
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:42,985
He is not taking them,
do you understand me?

182
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:45,066
- Okay.
- I don't care who his friends are.

183
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,306
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

184
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:49,544
Good, okay.

185
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:56,906
Okay, you look like a reasonable man.

186
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:58,536
You do. Are you a reasonable man?

187
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:00,425
Um...

188
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:01,960
I mean, yeah, I guess.

189
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,137
What's it gonna take?

190
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:06,216
I mean...

191
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:09,512
What is he paying you?

192
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,425
I don't have a lot, but I...

193
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,832
I will pay you what I have

194
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:16,393
to make sure that you never saw us, okay?

195
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,329
So just tell me what it's gonna take.

196
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,817
Coffee.

197
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,161
Excuse me?

198
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:28,073
A cup of coffee. It's
been a really long trip,

199
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,632
and I think that there has
been a huge misunderstanding.

200
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:39,786
Um... have you ever heard

201
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:42,632
of someone named Ellison Oswalt?

202
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,649
Yeah. Yeah, who hasn't heard about that.

203
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:46,058
That was terrible what happened.

204
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,369
Mr. Oswalt was a friend of mine.

205
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:49,064
I was helping him on his
book that he was writing

206
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:50,985
- about the case...
- Oh, so...

207
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,738
Are you here 'cause of
what happened at the church?

208
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:54,793
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,552
You think they're related?

210
00:20:56,585 --> 00:20:57,993
No, they...

211
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,816
The crimes share a lot of similarities.

212
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:02,505
I'm just following up on
cold cases that look similar.

213
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,520
Hmm. How's there any money in that?

214
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:06,697
There's not, really.

215
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:09,417
But fortunately, there's always somebody

216
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,209
that needs a private detective

217
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:13,321
to check in on a spouse or an employee,

218
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,336
- so when I'm not doing that...
- You do this.

219
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,874
Yeah.

220
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:19,497
Uh...

221
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,362
Have you ever seen
anything on your property

222
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:25,704
that looks like this?

223
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,329
No.

224
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,682
Mmm. You weren't supposed to be here.

225
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:42,665
I was told that this place was empty.

226
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:45,096
Right. My friend Jillian,
her dad owns the land now,

227
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,498
and when things between my
husband and I went south,

228
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:49,256
she was nice enough to put us up here,

229
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:52,105
but she told me that
nobody ever comes out here.

230
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,656
Oh, so... So the boys, is that...

231
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,257
Do you have legal custody, or is that...

232
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,496
I do, yes. It's, uh...

233
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,256
It's temporary, though.

234
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,953
Well, look, you...

235
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:05,001
You're welcome to stay
awhile and look around,

236
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,681
- whatever you need.
- No, it's getting late.

237
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:11,720
You don't want to creep around
a murder scene in the dark, huh?

238
00:22:11,753 --> 00:22:13,513
No, ma'am.

239
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,304
In all honesty, I do not.

240
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:18,345
- It's Courtney.
- Okay, Courtney.

241
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:20,168
Do you mind if I come back here tomorrow

242
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,129
and have a look around?

243
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,432
No, but on one condition.

244
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:25,865
- Anything.
- Nobody gets to know that we're here.

245
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:28,234
No one.

246
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,760
I don't know who I'd tell.

247
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,553
Good.

248
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:50,058
Goddamn it. Damn it!

249
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:55,144
<i>Karen! Karen?</i>

250
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,721
Boys, let's, uh...

251
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,192
Let's get ready for bed.

252
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:07,529
Brush your teeth.

253
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,321
Can we just watch till the next commercial?

254
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:12,168
- No, now.
- Come on!

255
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,481
I don't like it when you boys

256
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:15,176
watch stuff like that before bed, okay?

257
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,256
It's not real, Mom. It's
okay if it's not real.

258
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:18,793
Yeah, but it'll still give you nightmares.

259
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:19,848
So let's go, come on.

260
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:22,760
Brush your teeth.

261
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,520
What did that man want today?

262
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,282
- Uh...
- Was he one of Daddy's friends?

263
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:29,288
No, no, no. He was just
looking for something.

264
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,977
Was he here about what
happened in the church?

265
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:34,344
What do you mean what
happened in the church?

266
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:36,009
We know about the church, Mom.

267
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,897
We're not stupid.

268
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,369
Hey, who told you two about
what happened in the church?

269
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,481
We just heard about it.

270
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,921
Yeah, everyone knows.

271
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:52,520
All right, well, I don't want you two

272
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:54,280
thinking about that, okay?

273
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:58,026
Dylan? Is that why you're
afraid of the church, baby?

274
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,024
You don't have to worry about that, okay?

275
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:03,689
There's nothing in that
church that can hurt you.

276
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,561
Hey! Hey, you guys.

277
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:09,417
Hey, hey, okay, okay.

278
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,945
Okay, okay, come on.
Brush your teeth, let's go.

279
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:13,897
What happened in the church?

280
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,568
What?

281
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,426
What the...

282
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,096
What...

283
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:46,857
What?

284
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:34,536
Come on. Let's watch another.

285
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,801
No, I don't want to watch any more of them.

286
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,617
Hi, Emma.

287
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:09,929
Are you having the dreams?

288
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,272
We all had the dreams.

289
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:14,056
The movies make the dreams go away.

290
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:15,785
Once you watch them all,

291
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,672
you never have a bad dream again.

292
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:18,824
For real?

293
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:20,873
Swear.

294
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:45,480
Let's watch another.

295
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,929
No. I don't wanna watch any more movies.

296
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,784
But you have to.

297
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:53,257
You haven't watched the best ones yet.

298
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:56,904
Besides, you won't have
any more bad dreams tonight.

299
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,697
Or tomorrow if you watch another.

300
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:03,177
Good night, Milo.

301
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:18,185
You aren't so special, you know.

302
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,584
- What?
- I can see them too.

303
00:29:20,616 --> 00:29:22,729
You aren't so special.

304
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:28,329
Aren't you gonna say anything?

305
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:35,208
Hey, answer me. Pussy.

306
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,129
Zachary Collins, what did
you just call your brother?

307
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:38,857
- Nothing.
- Don't you tell me "nothing".

308
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,944
Okay, remember what I told you boys?

309
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,609
Speak only when spoken to,

310
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:47,722
and tell you what he asks us.

311
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,872
So here it is.

312
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,231
The scene of the crime.

313
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:06,152
So how were they killed? Do you know?

314
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:07,880
Unfortunately, I do.

315
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:09,736
Tell me.

316
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,384
Trust me, you don't want to know.

317
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:17,224
Uh...

318
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:19,112
I'm gonna look around in
here for a few minutes.

319
00:30:19,144 --> 00:30:21,609
I'm gonna compare the space to
some of the crime scene photos.

320
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,785
Yeah, sure. Uh, please.

321
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:25,384
Come back to the house
if you have any questions.

322
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,208
I will.

323
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:28,137
Thanks.

324
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:34,314
Okay.

325
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:56,521
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

326
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,657
Oh.

327
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:48,617
Come on.

328
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:54,728
What?

329
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,703
Oh!

330
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:07,657
Hello?

331
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:10,121
- Deputy?
- <i>Well, I'm not really on the force anymore.</i>

332
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:12,649
No, right. Of course, I'm sorry.

333
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,280
<i>Who is this?</i>

334
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:17,160
I'm Dr. Stromberg. We
spoke a few months back.

335
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:19,368
<i>You're like, the new
Professor Jonas or something?</i>

336
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,289
God, I hope not.

337
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,048
Jonas is missing.

338
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,153
<i>The police just
called off the search.</i>

339
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:28,648
Well, what happened to him?

340
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,993
<i>Look, I need you to, uh...</i>

341
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,720
<i>to come out here as
soon as possible.</i>

342
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:34,599
Uh, I'm a little tied up
with something right now.

343
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:37,865
Look, Jonas left...

344
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:42,184
he left something behind.
Something unbelievable.

345
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:44,137
<i>I think it could be
the key to all of this.</i>

346
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,576
Then tell me.

347
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:48,328
No. No, no, no. I can't-I can't risk that.

348
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,112
- Not on the phone.
- Okay.

349
00:34:51,145 --> 00:34:52,904
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- <i>Yeah, okay, that's good.</i>

350
00:34:52,936 --> 00:34:54,696
<i>Great, thank you.</i>

351
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:39,016
Hey.

352
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:45,481
Dylan, right?

353
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,809
How do you like it out here?

354
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:54,152
Be better if I didn't live

355
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,233
where so many people got killed.

356
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:02,088
So how you dealing with that?

357
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:06,888
I get it.

358
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:09,736
I'd be scared too.

359
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,487
And I'd have nightmares
in a place like this.

360
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:16,616
You having nightmares?

361
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,456
Yeah.

362
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:24,169
Yeah, I have really bad
dreams too sometimes.

363
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,216
About dead people?

364
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:30,824
A friend.

365
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:35,753
What do you do?

366
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:37,544
To stop the dreams.

367
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:43,433
Well, when I'm awake, I try to help people.

368
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:47,303
You know, make the real world
a little less like the dreams.

369
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:52,232
You let me know if the dreams start to feel

370
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:53,992
a little too real, you know?

371
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,537
I'm pretty good at dealing with nightmares.

372
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:07,624
Oh, no.

373
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:21,512
You cut your hair.

374
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:23,367
Bastard.

375
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,713
How dare you show up here?

376
00:37:28,263 --> 00:37:30,600
What the fuck is this?

377
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:33,512
I told you this would happen.
Told you I'd come for 'em.

378
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:36,424
No, no, this is bullshit.
You don't have a court order.

379
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,152
- You can't do this.
- Step aside, ma'am.

380
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:40,872
You need a court order.
Boys, get back in the house!

381
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:42,215
- Step aside.
- Get back.

382
00:37:42,248 --> 00:37:43,913
- Ma'am...
- No, you can't do this!

383
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:45,959
- You need to step...
- Let's see the order.

384
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:48,936
Step aside, sir. Now.

385
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,377
Who's the officer in charge?

386
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:51,849
I'm in charge, asshole.

387
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:54,152
Okay, okay, Officer...

388
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:56,137
Shermer. Where's the sheriff?

389
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,119
We're state troopers.
We don't have a sheriff.

390
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:00,329
- Now if you could...
- I know, I know. I can read the car.

391
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,801
I know that you're state troopers.

392
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:04,999
But I also know that
child custody transfers

393
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,632
is the responsibility of the sheriff.

394
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,776
And I can tell you from experience

395
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:10,792
that the only reasons that
the sheriff isn't here today

396
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,457
is because he either doesn't know about it,

397
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:13,831
or he doesn't want to know.

398
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:16,231
So, you want to call him? You know what?

399
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:18,152
I'll call, I got it. Don't worry about it.

400
00:38:18,184 --> 00:38:19,496
Sir, put the phone away
or I'm gonna throw you

401
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:21,320
in the back of the car myself.

402
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,112
Are you saying that you'd arrest me?

403
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:25,960
In a heartbeat.

404
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:29,096
Well, then I should probably inform you

405
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:32,873
that I was arrested a few years
ago on a big capital offense.

406
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:36,519
It was a major news story.
All the charges were dropped.

407
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:38,855
But if I were to be arrested again,

408
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:42,407
that'd be pretty big news. Yeah.

409
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,032
Whew! If the press got a hold of it...

410
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:48,519
Ugh. I would hate to be the uniform

411
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,048
that was trying to make a child abduction

412
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,456
look like a custody transfer.
State cars and everything?

413
00:38:56,488 --> 00:38:59,335
That just might be the
worst day of that guy's life.

414
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:00,264
Sir.

415
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:07,177
- Let's go.
- Gary? Hey.

416
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,679
I'm not leaving without my boys.

417
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:11,047
Look, that douche canoe
over there is right.

418
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:13,096
We don't have any legal
authority to be here.

419
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:15,079
He called our bluff.

420
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:16,904
I'm sorry, I can't lose my job over this.

421
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:17,865
I got kids too.

422
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,216
This isn't over.

423
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:27,175
Whore.

424
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,808
Thank you.

425
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,015
Thank you so much for doing that.

426
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:51,240
It's, uh... it's really no problem.

427
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:52,359
We gotta get outta here.

428
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,439
What? No, no... No.

429
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:56,104
- No, no, you, um...
- What?

430
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:57,575
You can't leave.

431
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:01,032
- Why?
- Uh, did you, um...

432
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:03,368
Did you have a restraining order?

433
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,128
No. No.

434
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,984
He had too many character witnesses.

435
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,104
I was lucky I got custody.

436
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:10,599
You have to stay because those officers

437
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:12,584
can testify that they saw you here today,

438
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:16,135
and if you leave overnight, then...

439
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,216
he will have a case that
you're a flight risk.

440
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,160
And he could get the boys.

441
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:23,304
Yeah. Yeah, he could.

442
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,912
But you saw him.

443
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:29,704
He'll come back.

444
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:33,128
Will you stay?

445
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:38,311
Maybe just... for dinner?

446
00:40:39,752 --> 00:40:41,385
Sure.

447
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,784
Sorry, I, uh...

448
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:02,792
They're used to...

449
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:04,359
Clint always ate first.

450
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,239
Well, I'm not Clint, so go ahead, eat.

451
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,103
So, were you a cop or something?

452
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:17,799
Oh, yeah.

453
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,655
A sheriff's deputy.

454
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:20,935
So you saw dead bodies and stuff?

455
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:22,600
- Zachary.
- What?

456
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,911
Cops see dead bodies.

457
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:26,247
That's okay. Um... Yeah, I did.

458
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,783
More than I'd like.

459
00:41:27,815 --> 00:41:30,311
- Did you catch...
- Did you catch a lot of bad guys?

460
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:35,112
Uh, not bad guys. Just people.

461
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:37,256
Having bad days.

462
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,336
But you're not a cop anymore.

463
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,224
- No.
- Why not?

464
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:43,656
Uh...

465
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:46,792
Because I got tired of seeing
people on their bad days.

466
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,184
I think you're good at dealing with people

467
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:52,679
on their bad days.

468
00:41:52,712 --> 00:41:54,089
Thanks.

469
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:11,816
Uh, thanks. Thanks for dinner.

470
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:13,480
You don't have to leave.

471
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,815
No, I... I have a really
long drive in the morning,

472
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,759
and it's... it's dark.

473
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:21,031
Does this place really spook you that much?

474
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:23,271
No, it's not like that.

475
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:25,736
Yes, it really does.

476
00:42:25,768 --> 00:42:27,976
It's really no problem.
I can fix up the couch.

477
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,472
- No...
- Please stay.

478
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:48,840
Oh, shi...

479
00:42:56,102 --> 00:42:58,344
What the hell am I doing here?

480
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,064
Jesus Christ.

481
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:48,327
You can't sleep, huh?

482
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:54,536
No.

483
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,056
Do you smoke?

484
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:00,360
Uh... no.

485
00:44:00,391 --> 00:44:03,624
Not really, um... This
is a secret cigarette,

486
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:05,704
- 'cause I'm a secret smoker.
- Gotcha.

487
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:07,016
You can't say anything to my boys.

488
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:08,583
They don't know.

489
00:44:08,614 --> 00:44:11,623
Okay, sure. I don't know when I would.

490
00:44:11,654 --> 00:44:14,215
I'm not their dad. That's weird.

491
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:16,104
That is weird.

492
00:44:16,135 --> 00:44:17,640
Don't say that.

493
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:19,975
It's like, oh, well, I wish you were.

494
00:44:26,023 --> 00:44:28,295
Was that true today what you said earlier,

495
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:29,767
about getting arrested?

496
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,544
Yeah. It's true.

497
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:36,648
You didn't do it... did you?

498
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,880
No, no. God, no. No,
it's nothing like that.

499
00:44:41,576 --> 00:44:43,591
That writer I was telling
you about, Ellison Oswalt.

500
00:44:43,622 --> 00:44:45,127
He's a friend of mine.

501
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:46,887
I gave him some files and some information,

502
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,807
even after my boss told me not to.

503
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:50,727
And since I was the last
person to talk to him,

504
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:52,968
and the only other person
they saw coming and going

505
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,880
from his home, I was a really easy suspect.

506
00:44:55,911 --> 00:44:57,544
I was cleared of all the charges.

507
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:59,592
Your boss was pissed 'cause
you went behind his back.

508
00:44:59,624 --> 00:45:01,479
Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:03,304
Fired me the day that I was cleared.

510
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,520
You miss it, huh?

511
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,016
Most days.

512
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:13,351
- Yeah, I do.
- Mmm.

513
00:45:15,752 --> 00:45:17,256
Can I ask you something?

514
00:45:17,286 --> 00:45:19,143
Sure.

515
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,455
Ask away.

516
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:23,464
Was it Dylan?

517
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:25,192
What do you mean?

518
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:29,255
That he hit.

519
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:33,928
How could you tell?

520
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,343
It's just that he reminds me of me.

521
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,688
Clint beat him real bad.

522
00:45:43,718 --> 00:45:45,895
He sent him to the emergency room.

523
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:51,399
All his cop buddies
weren't gonna do anything.

524
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:53,288
So you left.

525
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,232
Yeah.

526
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:00,295
So what's the plan?

527
00:46:00,326 --> 00:46:03,016
Uh... get the hell out of here.

528
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:07,239
Know where you're gonna go?

529
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:09,353
Far as I can.

530
00:46:11,558 --> 00:46:13,223
What are you gonna do?

531
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:14,600
Get a job, I guess.

532
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:17,318
- Yeah, furniture stuff?
- Yeah.

533
00:46:17,351 --> 00:46:19,111
- Yeah, I saw inside the church.
- Yeah.

534
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,455
- It's really cool.
- Thank you.

535
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:24,168
It's antique restoration, actually.

536
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:27,783
It feels almost magical
to turn something worn out

537
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:29,959
into something that's...

538
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:31,944
something that's beautiful again, you know?

539
00:46:31,974 --> 00:46:36,327
Like, polished and worthwhile.

540
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:40,391
Something that's gonna be
here long after you're gone.

541
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,312
Yeah.

542
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:43,240
Like kids.

543
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,456
Yeah, like kids.

544
00:47:02,248 --> 00:47:05,128
Come on.

545
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,504
I don't want to.

546
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:09,959
I want to go back to sleep.

547
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:11,784
Sweet dreams.

548
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,847
This one's mine.

549
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:23,815
Just play it.

550
00:49:16,295 --> 00:49:18,184
I know you're there.

551
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:23,014
Why'd you have to pick him?

552
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:25,894
Because you're not good
enough to be one of us.

553
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:30,024
You're not smart enough
to do what he can do.

554
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:32,455
Uh-uh. I'm better than
him. I'm smarter too.

555
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:35,846
If you were, then we would have chosen you.

556
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:40,712
Tell anyone of this,
and he'll take you first,

557
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:42,279
then kill your whole family.

558
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:43,432
Who, Dylan?

559
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:47,655
Then who?

560
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:52,358
Okay. Okay.

561
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,248
Okay, okay.

562
00:49:54,278 --> 00:49:55,399
Ooh!

563
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,487
- I can...
- Shh.

564
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:59,048
Now, listen up. Listen up.

565
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,447
- I live alone, so...
- Shh. Okay.

566
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,976
My God, I have to go to bed.

567
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:05,544
I have to go to sleep.

568
00:50:05,575 --> 00:50:06,727
Okay.

569
00:50:19,174 --> 00:50:20,967
It's been so long since I felt safe.

570
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:24,359
Sorry.

571
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,312
No, don't... it's not sorry.

572
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:34,502
I, um... I need to go to bed.

573
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:36,551
Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow...

574
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:39,398
I have... Um... I have a long...

575
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,734
- I have a long drive tomorrow.
- Okay, okay.

576
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,142
Are you gonna be okay?

577
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,935
- Yeah. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

578
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:46,886
- Okay.
- Okay.

579
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:47,846
Okay, good night, Courtney.

580
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:48,967
Good night.

581
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,247
Hey!

582
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:08,648
Oh, hey.

583
00:51:12,326 --> 00:51:13,766
Got you this for the road.

584
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:16,231
You didn't have to do that. Really. Thanks.

585
00:51:16,263 --> 00:51:18,184
You're going to have to
bring that back, though.

586
00:51:18,215 --> 00:51:19,816
Oh, I promise. I'll be back tomorrow.

587
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:21,831
But... But listen.

588
00:51:21,864 --> 00:51:24,296
Whatever you do, don't...
don't leave the house. Okay?

589
00:51:24,327 --> 00:51:25,320
Trust me.

590
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:26,631
Okay.

591
00:51:26,663 --> 00:51:28,551
Okay. All right, and I
left my number inside.

592
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:31,015
Yeah, I got it. That's mine.

593
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,550
So call me when you get there safe

594
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:34,343
and if you need anything.

595
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:38,023
Yeah, okay. Um, same deal.

596
00:51:38,055 --> 00:51:39,079
Okay.

597
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:40,103
- Okay.
- Okay.

598
00:51:40,134 --> 00:51:41,191
- I'll see ya.
- See ya.

599
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:48,870
"Same deal"?

600
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:50,824
Same deal.

601
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:52,231
Jesus.

602
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:04,902
Sorry. Uh, thanks.

603
00:52:04,934 --> 00:52:06,214
Oh, yeah, sure, man.

604
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:08,424
Uh, so, uh...

605
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:09,832
I'm not really sure...

606
00:52:09,863 --> 00:52:11,303
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

607
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:12,711
Uh, just a little too much coffee.

608
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:14,215
Um, you wanna take a seat?

609
00:52:14,246 --> 00:52:15,495
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

610
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:18,598
Great. Um, here, uh...

611
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:24,006
Look, I really appreciate
you making the trip.

612
00:52:24,038 --> 00:52:25,128
You're helping me.

613
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:26,311
Yeah.

614
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:27,270
You want a drink?

615
00:52:27,303 --> 00:52:29,606
No, that's okay.

616
00:52:29,638 --> 00:52:31,686
I'm going to have a drink. Cheers.

617
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:36,519
Um... what is all of this about?

618
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:39,848
Um...

619
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:42,279
have you ever seen one of these?

620
00:52:42,311 --> 00:52:44,071
This? Yeah, sure, it's a ham radio.

621
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:47,303
Oh, great, then you've heard
of the Norwegian bughuul.

622
00:52:48,327 --> 00:52:49,288
No.

623
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,942
Um...

624
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:53,158
years ago,

625
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,622
back in the '70s,

626
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:57,990
several ham radio enthusiasts,

627
00:52:58,022 --> 00:53:01,478
they ran across a strange transmission.

628
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,583
One night, out of nowhere,

629
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:08,488
on a rarely used band,

630
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,454
this... this children's piano

631
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:14,887
starts tinkling.

632
00:53:14,918 --> 00:53:16,679
And for years... I
mean, this thing would...

633
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,896
it would come and go...

634
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,968
I mean, it became an urban legend

635
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:24,038
until one day,

636
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,247
in the late '90s...

637
00:53:28,615 --> 00:53:31,047
someone finally caught it on tape.

638
00:53:37,766 --> 00:53:41,094
<i>Eight, nine, nine...</i>

639
00:53:41,127 --> 00:53:44,103
<i>five, zero, zero...</i>

640
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:47,719
<i>one, zero, seven...</i>

641
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:50,919
<i>five, one, nine...</i>

642
00:53:50,951 --> 00:53:53,352
<i>Stop.</i>

643
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:11,078
W-What were the numbers?

644
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,512
- Coordinates.
- To where?

645
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:17,478
A house. A farm.

646
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:20,392
In the middle of Norway, where
an entire family was murdered...

647
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:23,079
in 1973.

648
00:54:26,694 --> 00:54:29,991
So tell me, this murder...

649
00:54:30,023 --> 00:54:31,175
is there a...

650
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:32,455
Missing child?

651
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,374
<i>...bughuul...</i>

652
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:48,391
<i>...bughuul...</i>

653
00:54:48,423 --> 00:54:50,951
Bughuul.

654
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:52,263
Are there other broadcasts like this?

655
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:54,119
There are at least three others like it.

656
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:56,519
Now, this radio I have seen
over with Jonas' things,

657
00:54:56,551 --> 00:54:57,992
along with this map.

658
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,126
But Jonas found the pattern.

659
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:08,070
Yet the families are only
murdered after they leave the house

660
00:55:08,102 --> 00:55:09,382
where Bughuul found them.

661
00:55:09,415 --> 00:55:10,824
That's how I've been stopping it.

662
00:55:10,855 --> 00:55:11,943
I've been burning the houses down.

663
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,448
Wait, so the Oswalt house? That was...

664
00:55:14,886 --> 00:55:15,783
Yeah.

665
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:20,424
The pattern isn't the only
thing that Jonas found.

666
00:55:20,454 --> 00:55:24,967
He also realized the piano
was of particular significance.

667
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:28,391
There are fragments... references...

668
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:31,432
to Bughuul... the Bogeyman...

669
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:34,086
across all cultures, over
the centuries, that...

670
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:36,998
some cultures believed

671
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,855
that it lived in another realm,

672
00:55:38,886 --> 00:55:41,255
reachable only by ritual

673
00:55:41,286 --> 00:55:43,047
or sacrifice.

674
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:45,991
And others believed that it... it fed

675
00:55:46,022 --> 00:55:47,655
off of the corruption of innocents,

676
00:55:47,686 --> 00:55:50,727
but no matter what,

677
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:52,774
there are always three things in common.

678
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,663
There's a murdered family,

679
00:55:54,695 --> 00:55:56,231
missing children,

680
00:55:56,262 --> 00:55:59,015
and some form of iconological totem

681
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:01,479
or a thematic offering.

682
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:04,103
An image, literature, music.

683
00:56:04,134 --> 00:56:08,742
Okay, so the murders
are captured through art?

684
00:56:08,775 --> 00:56:10,983
It's aesthetic observance of violence.

685
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:17,159
But that little girl,

686
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:18,727
the piano,

687
00:56:18,758 --> 00:56:20,263
what exactly did she say?

688
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:24,006
It's Norwegian.

689
00:56:24,038 --> 00:56:26,086
She says...

690
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:31,591
"Quiet, Bughuul can't hear
me over your yelling, Mom."

691
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:40,295
It's the kids.

692
00:56:40,326 --> 00:56:42,534
He gets the kids?

693
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,991
<i>It's the kids.</i>

694
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:47,399
<i>He gets the kids?</i>

695
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,902
<i>It's the kids... kids...</i>

696
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,959
Okay, you should probably
destroy that thing,

697
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:55,143
like soon.

698
00:56:55,174 --> 00:56:56,646
Yeah, yeah, I really should.

699
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,535
Listen to me. There's another problem.

700
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,414
I found another house.

701
00:57:01,447 --> 00:57:03,496
Then burn it down. Break the chain again.

702
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:05,160
I can't. It's not that simple.

703
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:06,728
There's already a family
that's living in there...

704
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:08,230
a mother and her two...

705
00:57:08,263 --> 00:57:09,319
and her two boys.

706
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:11,303
Jeez... What... Detective!

707
00:57:16,615 --> 00:57:17,607
Say it!

708
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:19,174
- Stop it!
- Say it!

709
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,582
Say I'm better than you!

710
00:57:20,614 --> 00:57:22,599
Say it!

711
00:57:22,629 --> 00:57:25,286
Say it! Say it! Say it!

712
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:26,407
Okay, okay.

713
00:57:26,438 --> 00:57:27,399
You're better than me.

714
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:28,711
You're better than me.

715
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:30,759
Say you're nothing.

716
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,198
Say you're weak.

717
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,864
Say they made a mistake.

718
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:51,144
I hate you. I hate all of you.

719
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:52,231
I'm telling Mom.

720
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:53,511
You hear that? I'm telling Mom.

721
00:57:53,543 --> 00:57:56,391
Shh.

722
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:04,134
You don't deserve that.

723
00:58:04,165 --> 00:58:06,023
You should do something about him.

724
00:58:06,054 --> 00:58:07,590
And your father.

725
00:58:07,623 --> 00:58:09,128
And your mother.

726
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,264
My mother didn't do anything.

727
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,616
Exactly.

728
00:58:29,702 --> 00:58:32,134
Damn it, Zachary! What were you thinking?

729
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:33,670
- But Mom!
- "But Mom" what?

730
00:58:33,703 --> 00:58:35,623
Give me one good reason, one good reason,

731
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:37,543
why it was okay for
you to hit your brother?

732
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:39,558
Never mind. I'm sorry. Okay?

733
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,310
Okay, you t... you tell
that to your brother.

734
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,191
Fuck you, Dylan!

735
00:58:46,374 --> 00:58:47,431
Fuck you too.

736
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,767
Cunt.

737
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,695
What, are you going to
hit me now? Like Dad?

738
00:58:58,854 --> 00:59:01,350
Go to your room...

739
00:59:01,383 --> 00:59:03,558
and do not take a single step out

740
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:04,615
until I say so.

741
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:10,470
I didn't do anything, Mom.

742
00:59:10,502 --> 00:59:11,527
I know, sweetie.

743
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:13,095
Just weak.

744
00:59:13,126 --> 00:59:14,854
You are not weak.

745
00:59:14,886 --> 00:59:17,990
Don't you ever say that
about yourself. Okay?

746
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,591
You're strong.

747
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:20,807
Okay? You're like me that way.

748
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:22,087
Zachary, he's just, um...

749
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:23,366
Like Dad?

750
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:24,615
No, I didn't mean that.

751
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:27,399
But it's true, and you know it.

752
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,607
Dylan, I'm never going
to let anybody hurt you.

753
00:59:29,638 --> 00:59:31,526
You let him.

754
00:59:31,558 --> 00:59:33,094
And you let Dad.

755
01:00:42,374 --> 01:00:43,559
You're going to like this one.

756
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:47,174
It's my favorite.

757
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:52,902
No. I don't want it. Not today.

758
01:00:52,934 --> 01:00:54,598
It has to be tonight.

759
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,126
If we don't do this tonight, then...

760
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:58,087
Then what?

761
01:00:58,118 --> 01:00:59,654
He'll get real mad at us.

762
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:02,470
You don't want to make him mad.

763
01:01:02,502 --> 01:01:06,278
Please, Dylan. This one's mine.

764
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:07,400
I made it.

765
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:17,223
This is the last one.

766
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:20,391
No. No more.

767
01:04:20,422 --> 01:04:24,198
Just... on... more.

768
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,158
No.

769
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:26,950
Yes!

770
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:31,910
It's downstairs, Dylan.

771
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:24,487
Last chance to watch the last movie, Dylan.

772
01:05:27,781 --> 01:05:29,254
No, Mylo.

773
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:34,343
I won't watch any more movies.
I don't want to be like you.

774
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:39,173
That's fine.

775
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:40,998
They weren't really meant for you anyway.

776
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,047
What?

777
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:46,695
You did what we needed you to do.

778
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,199
Zach. Zach.

779
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:32,070
Zach.

780
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,671
Zach!

781
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:34,950
Zach!

782
01:06:34,982 --> 01:06:35,911
Zach!

783
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,062
Go to bed, Dylan.

784
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,998
Tell anyone,

785
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:51,846
and we'll kill you and your whole family

786
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:56,646
and watch the film over and over and over.

787
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:29,767
What the hell does this say?

788
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:32,198
There was an emergency hearing last night.

789
01:07:32,229 --> 01:07:33,830
Sorry you couldn't be there.

790
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:38,213
Judge T. Simmons. Tory
Simmons' boys work for you.

791
01:07:38,245 --> 01:07:40,838
Well, you'd be hard-pressed to
find anybody within five counties

792
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:44,134
that doesn't have a
family that works for me.

793
01:07:44,165 --> 01:07:45,797
This isn't right.

794
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:46,949
This isn't legal.

795
01:07:46,982 --> 01:07:48,551
Oh, you want to ask the sheriff?

796
01:07:52,774 --> 01:07:54,278
Don't...

797
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:56,390
let the kids see you in cuffs.

798
01:07:56,423 --> 01:07:57,542
You're not taking my boys.

799
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,334
Our boys.

800
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:01,158
I'm just taking them where they belong.

801
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:04,646
You're welcome to come with me if you like.

802
01:08:04,678 --> 01:08:05,607
Fuck you.

803
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:11,494
Either you can stay here without the boys,

804
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:15,654
fighting the courts for custody
until you run out on money,

805
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:18,566
or you can come home with me,

806
01:08:18,597 --> 01:08:21,382
spend all the time in the world with them,

807
01:08:21,413 --> 01:08:24,997
making cute little tables and chairs.

808
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:27,237
Either way, I'm taking them.

809
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:38,471
Dylan, I need you to pack
your stuff quickly, okay?

810
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,422
Honey, the police are downstairs,

811
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:42,085
and if you don't come out on your own,

812
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,301
then they're going to come up here.

813
01:08:43,334 --> 01:08:44,582
Mom, I can't go.

814
01:08:44,614 --> 01:08:46,086
We have to, baby. We have to go.

815
01:08:46,117 --> 01:08:47,366
You don't understand.

816
01:08:47,397 --> 01:08:48,934
You don't know what's going to happen.

817
01:08:48,965 --> 01:08:49,894
Nothing's going to happen.

818
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:51,207
He's going to hurt us.

819
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:54,758
I don't like this any more than you do.

820
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:57,382
But I won't let that happen.
I'm going to take care of us.

821
01:08:57,415 --> 01:08:59,557
Now, get your stuff.

822
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:00,999
Okay?

823
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:02,310
Come on.

824
01:09:50,725 --> 01:09:52,102
No.

825
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:55,238
No.

826
01:10:10,598 --> 01:10:11,751
Fuck.

827
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:29,574
Smells good.

828
01:10:35,718 --> 01:10:37,863
Come on. Come on.

829
01:10:50,373 --> 01:10:51,845
Pass the mashed potatoes.

830
01:11:01,509 --> 01:11:02,598
Thank you, son.

831
01:11:22,565 --> 01:11:23,814
You haven't touched your food.

832
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,437
I'm not very hungry.

833
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:28,518
Come on, buddy.

834
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,302
I got a big day planned for us tomorrow.

835
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:32,551
You're going to need all that energy.

836
01:11:35,269 --> 01:11:36,774
Eat!

837
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,247
Clint! Stop that now!

838
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:00,422
Boys have to eat.

839
01:12:09,957 --> 01:12:10,918
I'm sorry.

840
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,479
Okay?

841
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,222
Mr. Collins, I know that it's late

842
01:12:29,253 --> 01:12:31,110
but... but I need to speak...

843
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,509
You need to speak with me? Or my wife?

844
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:34,886
What? no.

845
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,389
No, it's not... it's not like that.

846
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:37,829
- You don't understand...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

847
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:39,206
I understand.

848
01:12:39,237 --> 01:12:41,510
Once you get a piece of a woman like that,

849
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:43,013
it's hard to shake it off.

850
01:12:43,046 --> 01:12:45,510
Okay, you are in danger.

851
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,910
I'm in danger?

852
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:49,286
Okay, just listen.

853
01:12:50,822 --> 01:12:52,262
I'm in danger? Huh?

854
01:12:52,294 --> 01:12:54,086
Listen.

855
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:56,198
- I'm trying to...
- Say it again!

856
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,510
I'm in danger?

857
01:12:59,621 --> 01:13:00,901
Say it again!

858
01:13:13,253 --> 01:13:15,718
Now...

859
01:13:15,749 --> 01:13:17,957
if you ever try to contact my wife again,

860
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:20,870
first I'm going to take it out on her hide.

861
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,726
And then I'm going to come and find you,

862
01:13:22,758 --> 01:13:24,327
and I'm going to shoot you.

863
01:13:25,797 --> 01:13:28,614
Am I making myself perfectly fucking clear?

864
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,966
Now, get off my property
while I go fuck my wife.

865
01:13:57,125 --> 01:14:00,134
All right, just stand up straight.

866
01:14:00,165 --> 01:14:03,174
Keep your eyes on the
ball. All right? Ready?

867
01:14:03,204 --> 01:14:04,197
Oh, good, baby.

868
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:05,765
Come on.

869
01:14:11,078 --> 01:14:13,766
Sure they're gonna like this one.

870
01:14:13,797 --> 01:14:16,326
Ready? Go for it. Hit the ball.

871
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:18,374
Jesus, why are your hands like this?

872
01:16:13,668 --> 01:16:15,589
I'm gonna make the best one yet.

873
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:18,565
Zach?

874
01:16:18,597 --> 01:16:22,598
Is that you? Zach?

875
01:16:22,629 --> 01:16:24,965
Zach! Zach!

876
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:29,158
Zach! Zach...

877
01:17:29,638 --> 01:17:30,662
Oh, God.

878
01:18:06,309 --> 01:18:08,101
Okay, listen. It's me. I'm here.

879
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:09,669
Just hold still. All right?

880
01:18:09,702 --> 01:18:11,046
It's okay. I'm going to get you down.

881
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:12,998
I'm gonna get you down.

882
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:15,301
Okay. It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

883
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:16,390
I got you.

884
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:17,798
Okay. Give me your hand.

885
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,495
It's okay. Dylan.

886
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:25,797
Hold still.

887
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:29,573
Okay. You all right?

888
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:30,725
- Huh?
- Baby.

889
01:18:30,757 --> 01:18:32,005
You better finish this, Zach.

890
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:38,726
Zach!

891
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:40,134
- No, run! Now!
- Zach!

892
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,589
Okay.

893
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:20,966
Oh!

894
01:19:20,998 --> 01:19:22,566
- It's okay. Hurry.
- I'll tie it. Hold it.

895
01:19:22,597 --> 01:19:25,254
Oh, God!

896
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:36,005
Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

897
01:19:46,117 --> 01:19:49,221
They're here somewhere, Zach.

898
01:19:49,254 --> 01:19:50,470
It's time to find them

899
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:51,621
and finish your movie.

900
01:20:00,388 --> 01:20:02,278
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

901
01:20:09,573 --> 01:20:11,686
We gotta get in here. Come on.

902
01:20:11,717 --> 01:20:12,837
Quick.

903
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:16,838
Shh.

904
01:21:26,245 --> 01:21:27,493
In here.

905
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:52,071
Run! Courtney!

906
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:35,302
Hey!

907
01:22:44,197 --> 01:22:45,542
No, no.

908
01:22:45,572 --> 01:22:46,565
It's over, Zach.

909
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:49,349
You're not making them a film.

910
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:54,789
No. No, no, no!

911
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,580
No! No!

912
01:22:56,612 --> 01:23:00,582
No!

913
01:23:06,245 --> 01:23:08,101
Please be another camera.

914
01:23:08,132 --> 01:23:09,541
Please be another camera.

915
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:10,854
Please be another camera.

916
01:23:13,252 --> 01:23:15,077
Oh!

917
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:23,653
He's going to be mad.

918
01:23:23,686 --> 01:23:25,254
He's going to be so mad.

919
01:23:25,284 --> 01:23:26,821
It's over.

920
01:23:26,853 --> 01:23:28,709
You can never come back.

921
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:31,237
No, I'm not finished!

922
01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:32,549
It's too late.

923
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,181
You had to kill them all.

924
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:56,965
Zach? Zach!

925
01:23:56,996 --> 01:23:58,437
He's gone!

926
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:00,485
No, no, no, Courtney. He's gone.

927
01:24:00,518 --> 01:24:01,957
We have to go.

928
01:24:01,988 --> 01:24:03,876
We have to go.

929
01:24:03,909 --> 01:24:06,534
Courtney, we have to go.

930
01:24:06,564 --> 01:24:07,653
We have to go.

931
01:24:07,685 --> 01:24:09,894
Go! Now! Go! Go!

932
01:24:24,932 --> 01:24:26,853
I got her.

933
01:24:26,885 --> 01:24:27,909
I love you, Mom.

934
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:55,142
Be right back.

935
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:24,614
<i>The kids. It's the kid... kids.</i>

936
01:25:24,645 --> 01:25:26,788
<i>It's the kids. He gets the kids.</i>

937
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:29,189
<i>It's the kids. He gets the kids.</i>

938
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:34,277
<i>Deputy.</i>

939
01:25:34,308 --> 01:25:36,997
<i>Deputy.</i>
