1
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,083
- Ernie?

2
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,500
-Glenda.

3
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,583
- Samantha?

4
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,000
- Yeah.

5
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,583
- I'm Michael.

6
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,041
They sent me to come get you.

7
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,166
- Great.

8
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,583
- The boat's over here.

9
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,375
- Okay.

10
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,792
I'll do this all by myself. That's okay.

11
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:56,625
That's fine.

12
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,458
- I'm gonna go open the house.

13
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:14,667
- Okay.

14
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,208
I wasn't expecting it to be furnished.

15
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,709
- Well, they did die in here.

16
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,166
Water's good, electric is good.

17
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,917
You should be good to go.

18
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,207
- How about wifi?

19
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:33,207
- You gotta call it for the internet.

20
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,001
Takes about three weeks

21
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,001
- Three weeks?

22
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:37,917
- It's an island.

23
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:41,834
You ever drive a boat?

24
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,250
I filled it up yesterday.

25
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,207
Try to keep the gas half full.

26
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,457
You don't wanna get stranded out here,

27
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:48,917
especially with the storms we get.

28
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,917
And there's an oar here just in case.

29
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,582
As far as getting this thing going,

30
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:54,917
you wanna make sure it's in run.

31
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:55,834
This is run up here.

32
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,291
That's off.

33
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,834
Up is run.

34
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,667
Away from you is forward,

35
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,709
towards you, reverse.

36
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,250
And then when you wanna turn it off,

37
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,333
red button over here.

38
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,834
Anything else?

39
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,166
- Best place to buy some
fresh fruits and vegetables?

40
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,125
- Couldn't tell ya.

41
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,875
Anything else?

42
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,750
- Not that I can think of right now.

43
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,875
- All right. And be careful out there.

44
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,291
Especially late at night.

45
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,291
We don't need any more missing tourists.

46
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:31,834
- I'm not a tourist.

47
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,542
- Right.

48
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,125
- Shut up and fish.

00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:52,125

60
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,792
Hi, it's Carl.

61
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,834
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

62
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,290
- Hi Dad.

63
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm here and it's just like I remembered.

64
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,417
I wish you would come.

65
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,917
Think about it. Love you.

66
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,250
So I woke up
in the middle of the night

67
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,500
because I was stressed,

68
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,750
so I was walking from
my bedroom to my kitchen

69
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,875
to grab a glass of water,

70
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,917
and I just really looked and realized

71
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,500
that it was pitch black in my apartment.

72
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,709
I couldn't see anything, I
was trying to feel around.

73
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,417
And I went to turn the lights
on and wake up even more.

74
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,542
And then I was like, I
don't know, halfway there,

75
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:46,959
I accidentally kicked
something from the hall.

76
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,417
Like accidentally.

77
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:52,959
I'd really like to emphasize accidental.

78
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,792
And so I felt so bad.

79
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:57,083
Because, yeah, I couldn't see,

80
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,542
where I was, I was walking and...

81
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,500
- Are you the girl on Elm Tree Island?

82
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,792
- I am. How do you know?

83
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,166
- No secrets around here.

84
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,583
Anyway, hey, I'm Mort.

85
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,583
I do boat repairs

86
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,625
so if you have any boat problems,

87
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,458
let me know.

88
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,417
- It says Cliff.

89
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,125
- Oh, I wrote it on the other side

90
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,417
- That you did.

91
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,709
Thanks.

92
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:45,542
- My pleasure.

93
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,625
- I'd be careful out there.

94
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,000
- I will. Thanks.

95
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,208
- You must be Samantha.

96
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,959
I heard you were coming.

97
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,041
- Yes, sir.

98
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,750
You officer Thompson?

99
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,458
- That's Sheriff
Thompson, but call me Sam.

100
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,959
We keep it simple around here.

101
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,667
- Were you the one who
found my grandparents?

102
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:10,667
- Awful night. Just awful.

103
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,959
I'm sorry for your loss.

104
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:14,709
- Thank you.

105
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,458
- Your grandparents were a fixture

106
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,709
in these islands for 65 years.

107
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,417
- This is only my second time out here.

108
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:24,917
First came when I was nine

109
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:26,250
and then my dad had a
falling out with them

110
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,417
and we moved out west.

111
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,709
- Oh, I remember. Where's back west?

112
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:32,959
- Vegas.

113
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:35,250
- Oh, is it nice there?

114
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,542
It's hot.

115
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,375
Last night I came out and there was a boat

116
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,208
about a hundred feet out there

117
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,250
and I shot my flashlight at him,

118
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,709
he turned off his lantern and drove away.

119
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,542
- Was it a male?

120
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,333
- I couldn't tell.

121
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,125
- Probably night fishing.
Did you call out?

122
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:53,959
- No.

123
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,125
- We deal with a few
drunk boaters around here

124
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,001
and an occasional fight at the bingo game,

125
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,917
but not much else.

126
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,583
- Dispatcher on Radio]
Sheriff, got a call about

127
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,041
some teenagers in the cove.

128
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,542
- Lacey kids again?

129
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,500
I think so.

130
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,583
- All right. I'll head over.

131
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,792
And teenagers.

132
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:13,917
Nice meeting you.

133
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,291
I just stopped by to say hi.

134
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,250
- You scared me.

135
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,250
- I knocked.

136
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,041
- I was in the shower.

137
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,083
- Okay. Checking on you.

138
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,208
Feeling good?
- I'm good.

139
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,667
- Okay, good.

140
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,959
- You were right about the internet.

141
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:02,792
Three weeks.

142
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,750
- Sounds about right.

143
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,792
- Okay, well, if I do need anything,

144
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:14,583
what's the best way to get ahold of you?

145
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,000
- You'll see me. I'll be around.

146
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:24,709
- Okay. I'll see you around then.

147
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:27,917
- Okay.

148
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,083
- Okay.

149
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,041
Hi, it's Carl.

150
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:02,333
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

151
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,291
- Can I help you?

152
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:03,250
Micheal?

153
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,542
- 911. What's your emergency.

154
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,833
- That's an interesting story.

155
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,417
- So you don't believe me?

156
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,750
- What happened to the box?

157
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:38,708
- I don't know.

158
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,250
It was gone after I called you.

159
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,875
Last night, someone was in my house.

160
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,792
- You saw someone?

161
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,625
- I saw a shadow,

162
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,625
and then I saw a boat
on the backside leaving.

163
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:52,750
- Was anything stolen?

164
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,958
- I don't think so.

165
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:58,917
- Probably some kids playing a prank.

166
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:01,875
- But Michael's boat?

167
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,959
- My guess is he went diving

168
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,959
and the boat broke free from the anchor.

169
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,125
- Yeah. Okay.

170
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,417
- Let me be honest with you.

171
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,583
I don't know much about
what happens in Vegas

172
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,834
but some people around
here don't like change.

173
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,041
Maybe you rubbed somebody the wrong way.

174
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,834
- So this is my fault?

175
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,792
- I'm just saying it might
take some time to fit in.

176
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,041
Carol.

177
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,417
Yeah Sam?

178
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,500
- Keep an eye out from Michael McKenzie.

179
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Let him know we have his boat.

180
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,333
Will do, Sheriff.

181
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,583
Got a call out at the bingo hall.

182
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,834
- Duty calls.

183
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:49,792
I'll send somebody out here
to collect Michael's boat.

184
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,792
You might wanna lay low for a few weeks

185
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,542
and don't upset any of the locals.

186
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,125
- I'm on a way.

187
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,333
- Are you gonna take a report?

188
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,417
- I'll take some notes when I get back.

189
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:04,417
Have a nice evening.

190
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:08,667
- Great.

191
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:35,000
Hi.

192
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:37,583
Can you help me?

193
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:50,208
Hello?

194
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:54,792
Hello?

195
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,792
Can you please help me?

196
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,041
Hello?

197
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,875
Huh!
- Jesus Christ, girl!

198
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:56,875
Mort. I'm sorry.

199
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,834
- What the hell are you doing out here?

200
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:01,625
- I was looking for help

201
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,625
and there was this woman and I...

202
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,834
- Mrs. Hunter. Forget it.

203
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:10,291
Just be wasting your time.

204
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,083
- Why is that?

205
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,959
- 'Cause she's a mute.

206
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,750
And she don't like company either.

207
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,333
- How'd you know I was here?

208
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,333
- Saw you walking into the
woods as I was passing by.

209
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,208
Figure you might be in trouble is all.

210
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,875
- I'm out of gas.
- Huh.

211
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:36,583
Dangerous place to be running out of gas.

212
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,166
- I can handle myself.

213
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,709
- Yeah. Seems like it.

214
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,959
When was the last time
you filled this thing?

215
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:52,959
- Two hours ago.

216
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,709
- You can't burn a full tank that fast.

217
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:59,001
- I know.

218
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,250
I think someone siphoned it
while I was getting food.

219
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,709
- Best be going.

220
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,917
Meat don't last long in the sun, you know.

221
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,500
- I'm vegetarian.

222
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,333
- What now?

223
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,583
- I only eat vegetables, fruits, nuts.

224
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,458
Some dairy.

225
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,458
- Really? Like what?

226
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,291
A rabbit?

227
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:23,375
- I guess so.

228
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,625
- You still got my card?

229
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,667
- Yeah.
- Good.

230
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:34,500
You have any more of these
mysterious boat troubles,

231
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,875
you give me a call, okay?

232
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,667
- I will. Thanks.

233
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,542
- It's probably just a local teen

234
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,458
trying to get your attention.

235
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,500
- With a dead rabbit?

236
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:54,250
- I'll take it back,

237
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,500
dust it for prints.

238
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,834
- This is funny to you?

239
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,125
- I'm sorry. Bad joke.

240
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,625
I'll go around to the other islands

241
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,542
and see if anybody else
is getting these boxes.

242
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:04,375
Okay?

243
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,458
- What about Michael?

244
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,834
- Michael?

245
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,959
- Did you find him?

246
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,709
- Oh, Michael was never missing.

247
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:16,417
He didn't even know his boat
drifted away from his dock.

248
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:22,041
- Okay. Thank you.

249
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,792
- You have plenty of gas.

250
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,083
- The sheriff came out here this morning.

251
00:44:58,417 --> 00:44:59,250
- Really?

252
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,500
You don't have a gas leak.

253
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:08,500
- Someone left a box with
a bloody dead rabbit in it.

254
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,625
- Now why the hell would
someone do something like that?

255
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,625
- I thought you might be able to tell me.

256
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:20,709
- Really? Why?

257
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,792
- Yesterday you said I eat like a rabbit.

258
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,834
- I say a lot of shit.

259
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:29,458
Just making conversation is all.

260
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,709
I don't care what you eat

261
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,208
- Then tell me what's going on.

262
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,959
Why does everyone want me to leave?

263
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,166
- Couldn't tell ya.

264
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,667
I like having you here.

265
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,417
- What's the wolf all about?

266
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:57,208
- Engine's fine.

267
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,875
Can't find anything wrong.

268
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,542
I can't talk to you about
this out in the open.

269
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:06,792
If you wanna know the truth,

270
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:09,959
meet me tomorrow, Crooked Creek, 2:00 PM.

271
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,959
That's all right. You can pay me tomorrow.

272
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,458
Might wanna buy an extra gas can though.

273
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:29,291
- What do you want?

274
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:39,458
- Mrs. Hunter?

275
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,375
I am so sorry.

276
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,834
I can't tell you how
bad I feel for almost...

277
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,709
Would you like some coffee?

278
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:54,750
Tea.

279
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,291
Danger.

280
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,125
What kind of danger?

281
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,834
This island is mine.

282
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:54,333
My grandparents left it to me.

283
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:07,542
Wolves.

284
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,333
I keep seeing that, what does that mean?

285
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,458
What is going on?

286
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,166
I'm not going to leave
because they don't like me

287
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,250
or I don't fit in.

288
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,417
This is my house.

289
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:07,750
I don't mean to be rude Mrs. Hunter,

290
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,709
but where I come from,

291
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,417
if you didn't stand your
ground, you became a target.

292
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:48,959
- Mrs. Hunter?

293
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,792
It's Mort!

294
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,333
I just need to talk to you.

295
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:07,458
Help!

296
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,041
- Don't move.

297
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,834
Turn around.

298
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,792
Now put the hammer down
and slide it to me.

299
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:12,041
Slide it to me, Michael.

300
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:23,959
Lay down on your stomach

301
01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:25,542
and put your hands on your head.

302
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:29,542
Do it.

303
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,291
Why did you come here, Michael?

304
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,792
Why are you trying to hurt me?

305
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,375
Sheriff is on his way. Just
tell me why you're doing this.

306
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:50,709
- Sheriff's not coming.

307
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:55,208
- Michael.

308
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,792
It doesn't it have to
end this way, Michael.

309
01:04:50,834 --> 01:04:52,250
Just tell me why.

310
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,458
Michael!

311
01:05:48,959 --> 01:05:50,500
- We found what seemed to be some sort

312
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,500
of shrine Michael made in
the attic of his house.

313
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:56,709
- A shrine?

314
01:05:56,709 --> 01:06:00,333
- He had dozens of photos of you, candles,

315
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,125
a couple of pieces of your clothing.

316
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,917
I'm sorry, this might
be a bit much for you

317
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:07,792
to hear right now.

318
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:11,959
I can't imagine how shaken up you must be.

319
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,333
Probably be heading back to
Vegas after this ordeal, huh?

320
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,917
- You ever been to Vegas, Sheriff?

321
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:23,625
- No, ma'am. I like it right here.

322
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:26,917
