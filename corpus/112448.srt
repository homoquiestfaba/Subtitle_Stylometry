1
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,726
I am a prosecutor.

2
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,522
I'm a part of the business of accusing...

3
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,732
...judging...

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,692
...and punishing.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,446
I explore the evidence of a crime...

6
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,741
...and determine who is charged...

7
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,994
...who is brought to this room...

8
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,288
...to be tried before his peers.

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,960
I present my evidence to thejury...

10
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,088
...and they deliberate upon it.

11
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,800
They must determine
what really happened.

12
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,929
If they cannot...

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,434
...we won't know if the accused deserves
to be freed or to be punished.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,272
If they cannot find the truth...

15
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,441
...what is our hope ofjustice?

16
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,288
Where's Nat?

17
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,707
Burying a goldfish.

18
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,087
That he forgot to feed.
Kid's gotta learn responsibility.

19
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,880
He's nine.

20
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,092
When you were nine,
you fed the animals on the block...

21
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,386
...and made dinner,
did everyone's homework...

22
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,972
...and, in your spare time,
you practiced law.

23
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,808
I didn't practice law until I was ten.

24
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,977
Listen to this.

25
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,897
"In their first face-to-face debate,
Nico Della Guardia...

26
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,733
"...appeared to throw
Raymond Horgan off stride...

27
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,778
"...with an opening swipe
at the prosecuting attorney's...

28
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,949
"...twelve-year tenure as
'an uninterrupted retreat from reality...

29
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:24,162
"'... and slow-motion surrender to thugs,
punks and hand-wringing liberals."'

30
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,373
The guy's unbelievable.

31
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:31,044
I'm finally starting to get used to that rug
on Della Guardia's head.

32
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,797
Don't eat standing up. Sit down.

33
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,050
Food goes down easier.
It has the help of gravity.

34
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,594
Oh, God.

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,513
Yet another lawyer.

36
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,733
I won't be home till late.
I got a game after school.

37
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,322
Like his father, he doesn't come home
till he has to.

38
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,575
If Raymond loses this election,
I could be home a lot.

39
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,286
Rick, I looked this over last night.

40
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,455
Top count, max.

41
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,207
It's a first offense!

42
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,043
No plea to anything
but the A-1 felony. Period.

43
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,419
On all of them?

44
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,712
All of them.

45
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,215
And no promises on the sentence.

46
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,970
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

47
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,057
This is for you.

48
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,644
Someone put it under the door last night.

49
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,646
I found it when I came in.

50
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,069
Mr. Big Cheese wants to see you now.

51
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,487
I'll be right along.

52
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,364
He said "now," now.

53
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,347
What's wrong?

54
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,018
Carolyn Polhemus was murdered last night.

55
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,521
Her cleaning lady found the body
this morning.

56
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,441
Some creep got into her place
and strangled her.

57
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,652
It looks like she was raped.
He tied her up...

58
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,781
...he beat her with some instrument
and strangled her.

59
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,659
No weapon. No sign of forced entry.

60
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,955
Unless you want me here,
I'm supposed to meet the coroner.

61
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,666
That's all right. Go on, get out of here.

62
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,252
I can hear Della Guardia now.

63
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:21,882
"If Raymond Horgan can't protect his own
attorneys, how can he protect citizens?"

64
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,886
Tommy Molto's secretary said
he wasn't coming in today.

65
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,849
Some fucking Acting Head of Homicide
he turned out to be, the little creep.

66
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,936
I should have fired him when we fired Nico.

67
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,563
If I had balls, I'd do it now.

68
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,317
I want you to handle this case personally.

69
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,402
I will assign it to somebody.

70
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,530
Who will you assign it to? Homicide?

71
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,782
Tommy Molto? For Christ's sake!

72
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,495
Della Guardia would love that.
Molto would tip him off on everything.

73
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:56,250
They're so close you can see Molto's nose
sticking out of Nico's bellybutton.

74
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,130
Listen to me.

75
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,968
What a waste.

76
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,930
Beautiful, sexy gal. Hell of a lawyer.

77
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,768
That's her ending. That's her au revoir.

78
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,896
The first thing we got to think about...

79
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,400
...is what the public thinks
in the middle of an election.

80
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,866
Take charge of this one for me, okay?

81
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,618
If you care about my health.

82
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,455
You're the only around here I can trust.

83
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:41,670
Greer's a good investigator, but I'd prefer
someone I'm used to working with.

84
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,255
Lipranzer.

85
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,882
Whatever you want.

86
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,968
Just catch me a bad guy.

87
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,338
So, I'm here.

88
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,802
What the hell was she doing with a B file?

89
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,889
Bribery of elected officials.
The case number is on her computer.

90
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,184
But the case itself isn't among
the papers in her files.

91
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,270
Why? Did she take it home? What?

92
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,896
Maybe it was taken?

93
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,982
Check the apartment.
What do you got here?

94
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,109
Bunch of pictures of a dead lady.

95
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,111
- No weapon found, yet?
- Nada.

96
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,696
It's a weird one.

97
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,740
She was strangled by the ropes
but by the way he tied her...

98
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,660
...it's like he put himself
between her legs and pumped...

99
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:41,290
...so they tightened up like he was trying
to let his weight strangle her.

100
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,709
Like he was trying to fuck her to death.

101
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,377
Look at the next one.

102
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:56,763
Check the computer for sex offenders
and cross match on Carolyn's name...

103
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,474
...or this business with the ropes.

104
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,646
Find out which of the creeps she put away
is out on parole.

105
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,401
I never did understand why you put her
in charge of rape and all that sicko shit.

106
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,905
She wanted it. And she was good.

107
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,407
Yeah, too good, maybe.

108
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,410
I'm not grabbing this, yet.

109
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,121
You worked with this broad.

110
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:24,875
She wouldn't leave her fucking door
and windows wide open.

111
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,171
She was drinking with him. She gave him
a glass of beer, like she was entertaining.

112
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,173
- Fingerprints on the glass?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,175
Greer sent it down to the lab.

114
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,763
You mean somebody she let in opened
the windows so it looked like a break-in?

115
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,100
She wasn't going to let some sex maniac
she sent to jail in for a beer.

116
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,688
On the other hand, we're talking Carolyn.

117
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,899
Mac...

118
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,945
...tell me what Carolyn Polhemus
was doing with a bribery file.

119
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,074
I had no idea Carolyn was interested
in crimes above the waist.

120
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,786
It's on her computer,
but not on mine or the department's.

121
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,538
That makes no sense.

122
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,832
Why don't you ask Raymond?

123
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,334
Ready for something else?

124
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,212
Molto's left.

125
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,466
His secretary came back from lunch
and found his desk cleaned out.

126
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,937
Exercise?

127
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,899
Masturbation.

128
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,444
The refuge of the lonely housewife.

129
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,657
Missed the 8:35. I tried to call,
but you weren't here.

130
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,952
Nat had dinner at Josh's,
and I was at the university.

131
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,289
I tried to get in a little extra time
on the mainframe.

132
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,791
Get anything done?

133
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,378
Who am I kidding?

134
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,632
Still working on my dissertation at my age.
It's ridiculous.

135
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,384
You were the best mathematician
in your class.

136
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,888
Second best just made
full professor at MIT.

137
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,474
All I've made are beds.

138
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,684
And now, the Channel Six local news.

139
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:52,606
Carolyn Polhemus, assistant prosecuting
attorney in Raymond Horgan's office...

140
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,776
...was found brutally murdered
in her Southside apartment.

141
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,821
Police are about to release a statement
about the circumstances of her death...

142
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,031
You hear?

143
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,576
Eugenia was thrilled to be messenger
of bad tidings.

144
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,247
Yeah, I'll bet.

145
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,793
From top to bottom
we are riddled with cruelty.

146
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,295
We must expose and punish it...

147
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,550
...especially when inflicted
upon the impotent and the ignored.

148
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,846
You sound like a woman with a mission.

149
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,639
I am.

150
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,934
The murder of Ms. Polhemus...

151
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,604
You have a suspect?

152
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,773
We have diddly-shit.

153
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,991
So Dan Lipranzer and Rusty Sabich
will work night and day for two weeks...

154
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:47,035
...to catch Raymond a killer.
That's the strategy.

155
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,455
You're in charge of this investigation?

156
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,001
Raymond insisted I take it on.

157
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,632
With 150 lawyers, they couldn't find one
who didn't fuck her to put in charge?

158
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,512
Did you tell Raymond?

159
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:09,224
This is a conflict of interest.
Is that professional?

160
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,313
Barbara, I'm Raymond's chief deputy.

161
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,648
You are so predictable.

162
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,320
It's your way of reliving the whole thing.

163
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,323
She's dead and you're still obsessing.

164
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,002
Rusty.

165
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,046
Nico.

166
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,256
She was just...

167
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,843
- Splendid.
- That's it. Very good.

168
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,597
Raymond's pressing hard
on that case, I imagine.

169
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,850
Raymond presses hard on every case, Nico.

170
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,229
You know who would've been hard
to beat? You.

171
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,524
You would've been tough. Very tough.

172
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,194
You are really something.
Where's Tommy Molto?

173
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,695
Molto?

174
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,823
I thought he'd come to the funeral
of his favorite colleague.

175
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,159
You must really have him scrambling.

176
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,541
Judge.

177
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,840
Who's that with Raymond?

178
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,300
I'm told that's her ex-husband.

179
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,471
I didn't know she had one.

180
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,684
Teaches college someplace.

181
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,144
Carolyn Polhemus worked for me.

182
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,689
I hired her...

183
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,941
...over the objections of...

184
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,279
...many of our prosecutors
who felt shejust didn't have the stuff.

185
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,991
I see those prosecutors here today...

186
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,995
...along with thejudges she defied...

187
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,832
...and the defense attorneys she defeated.

188
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,836
Why are they all here?

189
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,008
They're here because Carolyn Polhemus
stood for something.

190
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,595
She stood forjustice.

191
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,239
The Prosecutor's Office,
under my leadership...

192
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,533
...has a conviction rate of over 91 percent.

193
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,660
Mr. Della Guardia, or...

194
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,373
...as he is known to those of us
who have had to work with him, "Delay"...

195
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,584
There's food here for 100 people.

196
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,127
A lot of no-shows.

197
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,546
They smell a loser.

198
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,967
- Good speech.
- What the hell is happening with Carolyn?

199
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,178
Everything's in the works.

200
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:55,015
I reassigned her cases, and this afternoon
I gotta deal with Molto's stuff.

201
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,267
What's with this reassignment shit?

202
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,852
Goddamn it, Rusty!

203
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:02,189
I told you to give this investigation
top priority.

204
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,152
Nico is eating me alive with this thing.
The election is in ten days.

205
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,072
If you don't find Carolyn's killer,
we are both history.

206
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,408
Turn all of that administrative bullshit
to Mac.

207
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,786
Mac has more than she can handle.

208
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,039
And let me remind you,
we lost two key PA's in one day.

209
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:22,709
You only have time for the election.
I've got to run the office.

210
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:25,921
Fuck the office!
Don't you see what's happening?

211
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,383
If you don't find me a killer,
there is no fucking office!

212
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,595
I want you right on top
of Carolyn's case, understand?

213
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,016
Run out every ground ball and do it
in an orderly goddamned fashion!

214
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,646
Start acting like a fucking professional!

215
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,232
The campaign is a total disaster.

216
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,403
Haven't taken a poll in two weeks.
We don't know where the hell we are.

217
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,656
You're ten minutes late
for the bar meeting on criminal procedure.

218
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,242
Call them and tell them I'm on my way.

219
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,916
Did you assign a bribery case to Carolyn?

220
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,002
There's a file missing.

221
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,922
Loretta, find my driver.
Tell him to be ready to leave.

222
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,092
She had a case on her computer
we can't account for.

223
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,595
It was logged in as a B file.

224
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,933
Nobody knows where it came from.

225
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,437
Nobody knows where it went.

226
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,815
Where the hell is my speech?
It was right here on my desk.

227
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,275
Cody has it.

228
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,527
You're giving me a runaround.

229
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,781
Cody, pull the car around.
I'll meet you down in front.

230
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,202
Give me a straight answer, will you, Boss?

231
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,299
There's the B file, Tiger.
Read it, and we'll talk.

232
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,720
"Dear Mr. Horgan.

233
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,807
"This is about a deputy prosecuting
attorney who is taking bribes.

234
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:04,269
"Five years ago,
a person I'll call 'Noel' got arrested.

235
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,147
"I gave him $1,500 to pay somebody off.

236
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:12,152
"We went out to North Branch.
A secretary who seemed to know Noel...

237
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:17,157
"...took him into the PA's office, where
a man he could not see talked behind him.

238
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,829
"Ten days later, Noel went to court
and a lawyer from the PA's office...

239
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,123
"...told the judge that
the case was dismissed.

240
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,335
"I can't remember the lawyer's name.
I hope you get him.

241
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,588
"I hope you get Noel, too.
He has let me down."

242
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,091
- Unsigned.
- Unsigned.

243
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,760
Five years ago.

244
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,054
That guy must write real slow.

245
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,473
"Noel equals Leon."

246
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,018
This is Carolyn's handwriting.

247
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,188
Looks like she went to North Branch
to see Kenneally.

248
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,825
You'll love what I got from Painless.

249
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,498
There's this guy's semen
inside her vagina...

250
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,250
...but there's nothing outside.

251
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,337
Painless figures she didn't spend
much time on her feet after sex.

252
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,465
He says, normally,
he'd see the guy's little thingies...

253
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,927
...swimming upstream in the womb,
when he looked under the microscope.

254
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,513
Instead, this guy's was all dead.

255
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,183
Nothing went nowhere.

256
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,476
So Painless figures he's sterile.

257
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,937
He's got blood type A.

258
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,523
My very own.

259
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,693
I thought of that. But you got a kid.

260
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,697
Anything from hair or fiber?

261
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,782
No hair or skin fragments under her nails.

262
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,743
Carolyn would've fought back.

263
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,454
Maybe she was playing sex games
with the wrong guy.

264
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,957
The rope is K-Mart, Sears, Walgreen's.
You name it.

265
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,878
They found carpet fibers
from some other location. Zorak V.

266
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,172
It's only the biggest seller.

267
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:59,218
You call the Fingerprint Lab
on the bar glass?

268
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,595
Oh, I forgot.

269
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,097
You are a class-A fuck-up, you know?

270
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,558
They ain't going to expedite it for me.

271
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,978
I got the phone company printout
on her apartment.

272
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:17,402
I notice that one of the numbers
that comes up is yours a number of times.

273
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,738
At the office.
We were working cases together.

274
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,740
No, she's calling your home.

275
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,538
She never called me at home.

276
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,299
I made these calls...

277
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,427
...to Barbara from Carolyn's apartment.

278
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,389
"Late again, kid."

279
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:49,434
"This trial's a bitch.
I'll catch dinner in town."

280
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,109
I'd just as soon you'd let it go.

281
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:03,615
If Barbara sees a phone company
subpoena, now, she'll bust a gut.

282
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,956
Under the circumstances,
if you don't mind...

283
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,542
...l'd appreciate it.

284
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,630
I gave Barbara...

285
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,302
...enough pain.

286
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,474
Polhemus was bad news.

287
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,396
Know what they're calling you
and your partner downtown?

288
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,480
Spare me.

289
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,441
"Mission lmpossible."

290
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,611
Guerasch, bring that shit in my office.

291
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:45,407
So you're figuring what? The guy
she was having cocktails with did her?

292
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:49,495
I figure it was somebody who knew
what he wanted it to look like.

293
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,747
Cop. PA. A private dick.

294
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,542
Remember that lady PA
who was here four months ago?

295
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,169
Yeah, nice set of lungs.

296
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,422
This kid's gonna make a copper.
Never forgets a bra size.

297
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,508
He wants to know
what she was looking for.

298
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,511
She was looking for someone
by the name of Noel.

299
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,140
It took me a week to find this crap.

300
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,101
Five years back,
they booked 150 a day then.

301
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,603
Public indecency.

302
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,022
They were cleaning out the faggots.

303
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,234
Back when Raymond got some balls
for a day and a half.

304
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,862
- She find anything?
- I don't know.

305
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,699
When I gave these files to her,
they were in nice order.

306
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,327
The bitch just trashed them.

307
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,413
She never gave a shit
about anybody else's work.

308
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,624
One's completely missing. Look.

309
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,210
See right here? It skips a number.

310
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,296
Tommy Molto been looking at these?

311
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,507
What does Molto have to do with this?

312
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,926
Would there still be a court file
on this case?

313
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,555
That far back, it'd have to be in storage
on microfilm by now.

314
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,396
You don't want to say
what this is about, maybe?

315
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,231
Gee, Lionel, I can't.

316
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,317
She used to ask about you, you know.

317
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:06,154
Five, six years ago when she worked
out here as a probation officer.

318
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,866
- Five years ago I didn't know her.
- Sure you did.

319
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,326
The night you brought the Night Saints in.

320
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,954
You were hot stuff. A regular fucking hero.

321
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,373
Breaking the meanest guy
this side of Watts.

322
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,501
There was a lot of talk
you'd end up in Horgan's job.

323
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,920
She wanted to know what you were like.

324
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,756
I told her you didn't fuck around.

325
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,260
Dad, look who's here.

326
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,890
- How are you?
- Good. Mom's in a good mood.

327
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,850
How'd you know I'd be on this ferry?

328
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,476
Took a chance.

329
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,605
How was your day?

330
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:43,775
Well, I figured out today,
it's ten years this week...

331
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,778
...that I'm working on my dissertation.

332
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:50,282
I thought we'd celebrate.
Going to take us to dinner?

333
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,703
Why don't you just give up
on that dissertation?

334
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,580
It makes you miserable.

335
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,208
Your mom's not a giver-upper.

336
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,376
Maybe that's her problem.

337
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,795
I sure wouldn't do math unless I had to.

338
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,215
You got my genes in the math department.

339
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,967
If not for your mom,
I'd still be taking algebra.

340
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:11,053
I had to be good at something.

341
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,222
You were good at everything.

342
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,224
School.

343
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,727
Did you ever cheat?

344
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,188
Like borrow someone else's homework?

345
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,690
Copy it and pretend it was mine?

346
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:29,613
Why do I have the feeling that question
has some personal relevance?

347
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,406
I didn't say I did.

348
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,283
It's all right, kid.

349
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,996
It's good to see you guys happy.

350
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:46,630
Pretty.

351
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,258
It's new.

352
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,302
It's very pretty.

353
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,941
Mr. Polhemus? I'm Rusty Sabich.

354
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:53,113
Seems so strange to be talking about her
after all these years.

355
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,533
You hadn't had much contact
with her, then?

356
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,494
None since she left.

357
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,954
What about her family?

358
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:03,624
I have no idea where she came from.

359
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,504
She lied her way into the university.
Made up some kind of background.

360
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,382
She was very good at playing roles.

361
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,429
When she left me, I lost all pride.

362
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,723
I begged her not to leave.

363
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:24,019
The last time she looked at me,
it was with disgust.

364
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:27,898
Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to
could be so weak.

365
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:32,903
At that moment, I had the most
desperate wish that she were dead.

366
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,410
Maybe she made a man feel like that
who actually acted on his fantasy.

367
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:46,041
Would you like to see what she looked like
at that time?

368
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,420
Yes, I would.

369
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,676
They were taken at about the time
we were married.

370
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,818
This isn't just work?

371
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,530
No.

372
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:41,471
On the Polhemus thing, what the fuck
is happening to the fingerprints report?

373
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,809
Don't give me that computer crap!
You know I don't understand that shit.

374
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,229
They want to know how big a field
you want it run against?

375
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:50,898
We could do convicted felons...

376
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:54,067
...anybody ever fingerprinted,
county employees, etc.

377
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,571
Just do felons.
We'll do the rest if we need them.

378
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:00,199
Do them all. I may never get back on.

379
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,326
Do everybody. How soon?

380
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,245
What the fuck takes a week?

381
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,831
The man has the biggest murder case
in the city...

382
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:10,000
...and he has to kiss your ring?

383
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,503
I know. I know.

384
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:17,341
We don't have jurisdiction
over the computer.

385
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,430
- A week. Probably ten days.
- I need them yesterday.

386
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,975
I'll push, but I don't think
you'll see them any sooner.

387
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,729
Have your copper get the glass back
from Evidence and down to the lab...

388
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,940
...in case they need it for anything.

389
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,110
Ah, Mr. Sabich.

390
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,780
Real important stuff.

391
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,491
We got the chief deputy with us.

392
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,369
Lipranzer and I were wondering,
on your report...

393
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:49,957
...are you indicating the guy bashed her
after she was strangled by the ropes?

394
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,500
Read the fucking report.

395
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,793
This report?

396
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:56,004
No, not that report. My report.
The autopsy.

397
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,844
See anything with bruises on the wrists...

398
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,930
...bruises on the ankles,
bruises on the knees?

399
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,975
Are you saying she was raped
and then tied up?

400
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,893
Tied up last, yeah.

401
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,938
She already died
from multiple head injuries.

402
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,482
Rape? Now I'm thinking...

403
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:17,359
...no.

404
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,569
Why?

405
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,071
Read the fucking report.

406
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,573
- This report?
- No.

407
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,659
This report? The chemist's report?

408
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,578
Yeah, the chemist's report.

409
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,582
She had a two percent solution
of nonoxynol-9 in her vagina.

410
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,752
A spermicide used with a diaphragm.
That's why his sperms were dead.

411
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:38,922
Diaphragm? You missed a diaphragm
in the autopsy?

412
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,218
No. You've been to autopsies.
You slice her wide open.

413
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,637
No diaphragm in that lady.

414
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,514
What happened to it?

415
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,516
Somebody took it.

416
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,645
I think it's a setup.

417
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,606
This man...

418
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,859
...is her lover. He comes over.
They have drinks.

419
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:02,779
This lady has intercourse with him.
Real nice. Okay?

420
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,783
But he's an angry guy.
Picks up something, kills her.

421
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,203
Tries to make it look like rape.

422
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:10,662
Ties her up.

423
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,623
Pulls out the diaphragm.

424
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,250
That's what I think.

425
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,713
What does Tommy Molto think?

426
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,887
You got his phone number right there.
Want to jot it down in case you need it?

427
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:29,223
Next time you talk to him...

428
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,266
...tell him to call me so I can find out...

429
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,353
...what's going on
in my own fucking investigation.

430
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:36,897
Painless...

431
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,858
...you tell Molto, and you tell Nico, too...

432
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,611
...that this is cheap, cheap politics.

433
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,905
Cheap Police Department bullshit.

434
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:49,284
God better help them and help you, too.
I can't make a case for tampering.

435
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:54,414
Our poll shows Della Guardia's leading
Horgan by four percent. Eight days left.

436
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,000
At least it's made somebody happy.

437
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,002
I don't want to see you out of here.

438
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,963
Come on, pal. We're old news.

439
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:05,259
I'd miss you. Who else here can talk
morality and ethics and not break me up?

440
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:10,097
Voters smell an exhausted man who's lost
sight of all the important issues.

441
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,974
Issues? Bullshit.

442
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,477
The only issue is Raymond Horgan
has respect for the law...

443
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:19,898
...and Nico Della Guardia will fuck the law
for politics. That's the issue.

444
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,236
Rusty...

445
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:27,406
Have you ever been to an Irish wake?

446
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:31,493
Come on over and pull up a glass.

447
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:35,497
Know what Della Guardia
is going to find out?

448
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:38,000
You run for office because...

449
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:42,296
...you think you can make people do things,
make things better.

450
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,630
But you can't.

451
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,090
Nobody can.

452
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,720
You get a few potholes filled,
keep the lid on the best way you can.

453
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,138
But in the end...

454
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:54,474
...all you can do is try to hang on
to the fucking job.

455
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,315
I never used to drink when I started here.

456
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,985
Then, you still believed
you could make a difference.

457
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,698
Funny, part of me still does.

458
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,328
A guy as tough as you are...

459
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:18,207
...you're still hanging on
to the shreds of your ideals.

460
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,709
The shreds are all I got.

461
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:24,713
You're a good man, Rusty.

462
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,550
God bless you.

463
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,556
So, tell me, who's our bad guy?

464
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,727
It could be a boyfriend.
Some guy she picked up.

465
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:44,858
Whoever it is knew enough about her
to know what to make it look like.

466
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:47,653
Could be a law-enforcement type.

467
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,323
Jesus.

468
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,741
One of us.

469
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,879
You and Carolyn have a thing?

470
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:10,175
Don't beat around the bush.
Just come right out and ask the question.

471
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:17,850
I'll say that the decedent and I
were both single and both adults.

472
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,103
I had a thing with her.

473
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,273
She thought like everybody else thought...

474
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,608
...that I wasn't going to run again.

475
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:30,571
That I could just hand the mantle over
to anyone I chose...

476
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,491
...so why not a broad?

477
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:36,076
Why not her?

478
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,454
One more question?

479
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:42,541
I gave her the B file
because she asked me for it.

480
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,045
Because I was fucking her.

481
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,048
Stupid, huh?

482
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,094
She went over to Northside...

483
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:58,182
...shoveled through the records.

484
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,310
There wasn't anything there.

485
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,481
At least that's what she told me.

486
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,528
What are you going to do now?

487
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,822
Once the party's over?

488
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:15,532
I don't know.

489
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:17,701
I got an idea.

490
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,580
Suppose we try to get you on the bench.

491
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,667
I should still have enough clout
to pull that off. What do you say?

492
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,962
Why don't we just see
what the future holds.

493
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:36,011
Would that have satisfied her?

494
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:37,471
What's that?

495
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:38,680
A judgeship.

496
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:42,226
I wonder if a judgeship
would've satisfied Carolyn Polhemus.

497
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,784
Rusty!

498
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,162
Come say hello to Carolyn Polhemus.
Have you met?

499
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:04,373
I've seen Rusty.

500
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:08,043
I want to bring Carolyn on board
as a prosecuting attorney.

501
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:12,840
She's been working probation, Northside,
and she just passed her bar exam.

502
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,008
Congratulations.

503
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,260
Thank you.

504
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:18,929
She comes very highly recommended.

505
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,975
Why don't we see if we can find
a nice place for her.

506
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,060
I'd like the Index Division.

507
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:27,896
That's not a job, it's a jail sentence.

508
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:30,691
Rape, sex crimes, child molestation.

509
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,277
We can do better than that.

510
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:37,656
It's hard to get a conviction on a rape.
It's a dead-end for someone ambitious.

511
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,410
So you get the worst attorneys
trying the hardest cases?

512
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:46,081
Listen to this. We got another idealist
in the office.

513
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,259
He's five years old.

514
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:01,263
The doctors found 23 healed fractures
from old wounds.

515
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,601
Victim of his own beloved mother.

516
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,604
I need your help.

517
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:10,939
Your wife called.

518
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,195
Why don't you fire her?

519
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,406
Civil service. They're here forever.

520
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,035
Why don't you give this to Nancy.
You haven't had experience with kids.

521
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,953
Nancy's not available.

522
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,248
And, besides,
I'd like to try this case myself.

523
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:31,793
With your help.

524
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,213
Outline it for me.

525
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,757
About a month ago...

526
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,219
...the mother brought him
into the West End Pavilion Hospital.

527
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:43,138
The boy was unconscious
from severe head injuries.

528
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:44,890
She said he fell.

529
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,433
The doctor says...

530
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:50,562
...the head wounds were too symmetrical
to be the result of a fall.

531
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,481
He told me...

532
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:56,652
...he was treating a child whose mother
had crushed his head in a vise.

533
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,073
We have any proof it was the mother?
You got the vise?

534
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:03,408
Just the testimony of the child.

535
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:07,788
When he sees the mother in
the courtroom, he'll recant. An iffy case.

536
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,375
I've examined him several times and...

537
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,710
...I think he's begun to trust me.

538
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:17,714
Look, how many child abuse cases
does this office handle in a year?

539
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,091
Over a thousand.

540
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,176
Every one of them terrible.

541
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:23,679
Every one of them heartbreaking.

542
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:27,057
But I can't stop everything else
to take care of one case.

543
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,269
You're going to have to get somebody else
to help you.

544
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,938
You don't like me, do you?

545
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:37,359
I think you've turned out to be
a damn good prosecutor.

546
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:42,072
You're angry I didn't have to go
through the channels like everyone else.

547
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,659
Clearly, you're not like everyone else.

548
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:50,164
You think I got this job because
I fucked some fat-cat friend of Raymond's.

549
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,252
Look, it's late...

550
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,841
Come on, I'll drive you to your ferry.

551
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,471
This is not the way to the ferry.

552
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,724
I want you to meet somebody.

553
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,018
Wendell, this is Rusty Sabich.

554
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,523
He's a very important man in our office.

555
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,693
He's going to help me
when we go to court.

556
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,030
Remember what I told you about court?

557
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:24,406
Yeah.

558
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:26,658
Now, tell me.

559
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:30,037
There's a judge and some nice people.

560
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,997
They're called a jury.

561
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,791
And you're gonna ask me questions.

562
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,585
About what?

563
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:42,007
About what happened.

564
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:43,550
When?

565
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:45,761
When I got hurt.

566
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,180
What else did I tell you?

567
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,059
You said that if I told what Mommy did...

568
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:56,021
...the judge and the nice people
will protect me...

569
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,857
...and Mommy wouldn't hurt me anymore.

570
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,568
Do you think you can do that?

571
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:03,862
Answer my questions in court?

572
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,865
And tell what Mommy did to you?

573
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,537
I think you can.

574
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,705
Mommy will be there.

575
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:17,793
She can't hurt you.
She can't even talk to you.

576
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,462
You'll be completely safe.

577
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,383
You promise?

578
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,553
I promise.

579
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,021
His father got to him last night.

580
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:41,275
Told him God would put him in hell
if he testified against his mother.

581
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,442
He's terrified.

582
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:45,904
If you're not ready, we'll ask the judge
for a couple more days.

583
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:46,989
No.

584
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,783
We've got to do it now
or we'll lose him for good.

585
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:53,203
Your mommy took you to the hospital
because you were hurt.

586
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,706
What part of you was hurt?

587
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:57,541
My head.

588
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,210
How was it hurt?

589
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:07,217
Wendell, how did you hurt your head?

590
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,389
I don't remember.

591
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,729
Have you ever seen this?

592
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,230
Yes.

593
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:21,523
Where?

594
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,692
- In the cellar.
- At home?

595
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:24,902
Yes.

596
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,571
Did somebody put your head inside it?

597
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,365
Wendell?

598
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:36,079
What did you say when somebody
put your head in the vise?

599
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:41,335
You told me you screamed
when your head was put in the vise.

600
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:43,879
Remember?

601
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:45,756
You told me.

602
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,219
"I promise...

603
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:51,970
"...l'll be a good boy.

604
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:53,764
"I'll be a good boy."

605
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,517
Did somebody answer?

606
00:41:58,769 --> 00:41:59,978
Mommy.

607
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:03,440
Mommy said I was a bad boy
and I deserved to die.

608
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:06,109
And then what did Mommy do?

609
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:09,071
She made it tighter and tighter.

610
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,614
On your head?

611
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:13,617
She hurt my head.
My mommy hurt my head.

612
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,871
No further questions, Your Honor.

613
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:20,082
The doctors have told us...

614
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,959
...that the wounds...

615
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:25,337
...that Wendell suffered
could not have come from a fall...

616
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,965
...as the defense would have you believe.

617
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:32,803
The police told us they found a vise
at the home of the defendant.

618
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,931
Medical experts have testified...

619
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:39,518
...that the size and the shape
of the jaws of that vise...

620
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:44,606
...exactly match the size and the shape
of the wounds to the little boy's head.

621
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,317
And this evidence is clear...

622
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:49,486
...and uncontested.

623
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:54,199
But the most compelling evidence
in this trial...

624
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:57,077
...comes not from doctors,
or police officers...

625
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:59,496
...or other expert witnesses.

626
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,832
The most damning testimony...

627
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:05,252
...comes from an abused
and frightened child...

628
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:08,422
...who overcame his fear and his pain...

629
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:11,717
...to tell you, in his own words...

630
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,511
...what really happened.

631
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:20,017
If you're to remember nothing else
as you begin your deliberations...

632
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,102
...remember Wendell's words:

633
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:25,022
"My mommy hurt my head."

634
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,734
"My mommy hurt my head."

635
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,199
"My mommy hurt my head."

636
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:15,239
Congratulations.

637
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,163
It's gonna be so good.

638
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:02,197
You're still in love with her.

639
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,036
It was never love.

640
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,873
What was it, then?

641
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:19,214
It was never love.

642
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,887
What did she have
to make you feel so much?

643
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:39,067
Ladies and gentlemen...

644
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:41,236
...Raymond Horgan.

645
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,795
Thank you. Thank you.

646
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:03,050
I wanted to come down
and say a few words...

647
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:07,429
...before I call Mr. Della Guardia
and congratulate him on his victory.

648
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,098
No, no, no. Come on.

649
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:15,270
Of all the wonderful things
that have happened to me in 12 years...

650
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:17,940
...the best has been...

651
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:21,276
...knowing and working with all ofyou.

652
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:24,822
Wait till you hear what's going down.
It's strange.

653
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:28,075
Someone's fucked up over at the Hall.
It's way wrong.

654
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:29,868
- Why?
- I get a message.

655
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:34,039
I'm supposed to be in the chief's office
8:00 tomorrow to be interviewed.

656
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,123
By Molto.

657
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:37,167
No discussion. Interview.

658
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,836
It's like they're after me, right?

659
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,213
Another thing. When I came back tonight...

660
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:44,800
...they took all the receipts
of the evidence I inventoried on Polhemus.

661
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:46,635
No questions asked.

662
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:48,679
Sounds like you're off the case.

663
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:51,139
Sure. Fine, but figure this in.

664
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:55,185
I'm at the North Branch before 5:00,
going through the microfilm.

665
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,188
All of this hits by 6:00, 6:30.

666
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,984
Look what I picked up
while I was out there.

667
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:04,403
The case number matches
the complaint number...

668
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,905
...that was missing
when you saw Kenneally.

669
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,991
Five years ago. Bingo.

670
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,661
And look who's listed
as Leon's probation officer.

671
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:16,248
"Carolyn Polhemus."

672
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:18,333
Wait. Here's the best.

673
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:22,212
Who do you think was the deputy
handling the case?

674
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,175
Tommy Molto.

675
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:30,929
You keep this because I don't know
what the fuck is happening with me.

676
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:39,354
Tommy Molto.

677
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,901
Tommy Molto once worked here,
but we think he might be dead.

678
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,445
Raymond's inside.

679
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,363
We've been waiting for you.

680
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:57,664
Rusty.

681
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,959
Molto and Delay...

682
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,714
...have questions about
the Polhemus investigation.

683
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:08,884
This should not be handled this way.

684
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,470
You should speak with Rusty alone.

685
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:13,472
What's this about?

686
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:16,850
You were at Carolyn's apartment
the night she was killed.

687
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,227
Bullshit.

688
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,401
What was it, a Tuesday night?

689
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,573
Barbara was at the university.
I was babysitting.

690
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,784
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

691
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,078
We got the fingerprint results...

692
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:38,705
...the ones that you could never remember
to ask for.

693
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:41,291
They're your prints all over the bar glass.

694
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,377
Yours, Rozat K. Sabich.

695
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,922
Five feet from where the woman
was found dead.

696
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:51,260
Or maybe you didn't remember
that all county employees get printed.

697
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:57,266
This is absurd.

698
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,936
The phone records
you told Lipranzer not to get?

699
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,313
We had the phone company
pull them this morning.

700
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:05,357
You were calling her all month.

701
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,443
There's a call from your house
to hers that night.

702
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:16,118
My God, you're serious.

703
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:21,957
Tommy, for Christ's sake!

704
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,208
Sabich.

705
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:26,086
I want you to know one thing. I know.

706
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,087
Sure you do.

707
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,298
Go ahead, play cool. I know.

708
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:31,758
You killed her. You're the guy.

709
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:33,760
Oh, yeah?

710
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:36,763
Yeah, you're right. You're always right.

711
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:46,815
They think I killed her.
They're going to charge me.

712
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,819
Don't be seen with me, man.
They'll fucking bury you.

713
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:56,783
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

714
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,162
Are you sick?

715
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:07,169
Nico and Molto are charging me
with Carolyn's murder.

716
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:13,592
They found my fingerprints
on a glass of beer in her apartment.

717
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:19,097
What does this mean?

718
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:21,266
Grand jury investigation.

719
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:26,438
They will or they won't indict me.
If they do, there'll be a trial.

720
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,527
It's not going to go that far.

721
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,865
I'm going to need a lawyer.

722
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,870
A very, very good lawyer.
Expensive lawyer.

723
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:47,876
It could break us financially.

724
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,213
We can mortgage the house.

725
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,049
Or sell it if we have to.

726
00:52:57,302 --> 00:52:59,221
What time does Nat get home?

727
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:01,932
Nat?

728
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,103
Oh, Rusty!

729
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,703
A lot ofpeople think Raymond
shouldn't run again.

730
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:28,542
If he agrees to step aside, the party
will let him decide who will take his place.

731
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:33,005
They know he won't hand it all to Nico.

732
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,548
That's for sure.

733
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:37,885
Who would he choose?

734
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:41,513
Somebody from the office.

735
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,391
Carry on his traditions.

736
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:45,559
You?

737
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,356
Mac, maybe.

738
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,360
She'd make a great candidate,
in that wheelchair.

739
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,946
That chair is not very telegenic.

740
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,700
I think he'd pick you.

741
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:05,913
You're the natural.

742
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:13,212
Rusty...

743
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:16,256
...if you let him know you want it,
it'll be you.

744
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:19,885
I should just tell Raymond his time is up?

745
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:21,929
- You could be tactful.
- No.

746
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:24,223
Why not?

747
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,601
I'm not going to bite that hand.

748
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:30,437
If Raymond wants out, that's up to him.

749
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:34,233
He's still the best candidate around,
against Della Guardia.

750
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:37,444
Without Raymond,
Nico doesn't have an issue.

751
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,657
Pull the party's people and Raymond's
people together behind somebody else...

752
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,701
...that person would walk
into the PA's office.

753
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:46,870
It wouldn't be close.

754
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:57,798
You've thought a lot about this.

755
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:00,425
He just needs a push.

756
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:06,431
Push him yourself. It's not in me.

757
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:13,856
What?

758
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:17,401
Were you all set on being chief deputy?

759
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:20,362
Carolyn...

760
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:26,076
...if I can get away tonight
shall I get some take-out?

761
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,746
I like you, Rusty, but I think it's over.

762
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:33,458
It's just not right for me now. It's over.

763
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,252
I don't accept that.

764
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,045
You don't accept it?

765
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,672
Do I have a say?

766
00:55:41,216 --> 00:55:43,343
I don't want us to end up enemies.

767
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,854
Mac said it was all right.

768
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:55,689
Have it your way.

769
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:00,694
Someone's in my office.

770
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:03,864
What is it, Rusty?

771
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:06,867
I wanted to talk about this rapist
you habitualized.

772
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,577
There's some problems.

773
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,371
I'm late for an appointment.

774
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,875
I would appreciate it
if you could put it in a memo.

775
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,044
You keep avoiding me.

776
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:20,714
You communicate through memos.
You skip meetings I'm supposed to go to.

777
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,466
It's affecting work.

778
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:23,675
My work?

779
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:26,053
My work.

780
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,556
I tried to make it easier for you.

781
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:34,728
You make me feel uncomfortable.

782
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:37,981
I just want to be with you.
Can't we just talk about it?

783
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,027
I'm involved with someone else.

784
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:44,404
Since when?

785
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:46,907
What is it you want from me?

786
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:50,410
What do I have to do?

787
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:53,747
Grow up.

788
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,203
Rozat K. Sabich?

789
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:37,583
Rusty, I don't like to be here.

790
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:39,918
A search warrant for these premises.

791
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:44,131
Come on in.

792
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:03,400
They're taking swatches from your suits.

793
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,820
They'll try to match threads
from my clothing and the carpet...

794
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:09,740
...with fibers they might find
at her apartment.

795
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:12,326
They're not looking for a murder weapon?

796
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:14,578
I wouldn't be stupid enough
to bring it home.

797
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:18,832
If they look for it and don't find it,
they'll have to admit that in court.

798
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,668
I'll have to give a blood sample.

799
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:23,504
If you refuse?

800
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:25,839
They've got a warrant.

801
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,633
It's all routine.

802
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:31,678
I'm going to ask Sandy Stern
to take my case.

803
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:39,019
Hi, Sandy.

804
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:50,280
I realize you would like to avoid
public places at a time like this...

805
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:53,951
...but I don't think it is wise
for you to go into hiding.

806
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:58,497
I'm flattered that you want me
to represent you in this case.

807
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,208
You have been my toughest adversary.

808
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:06,129
Did you get my subpoena
from the grand jury?

809
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:09,299
This morning.
Clearly, we will not let you testify.

810
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:14,388
Sandy, you expect me
to take the Fifth Amendment?

811
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,056
Of course.

812
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:19,309
That I cannot do.

813
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:25,107
You don't want to prepare the prosecutor
by giving him pretrial statements.

814
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,902
Sandy, I don't think this case
is ever going to go to trial.

815
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:33,073
If I take the Fifth and refuse to testify
before the grand jury...

816
00:59:33,157 --> 00:59:35,325
...it could destroy my reputation.

817
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,247
The results of the blood tests
have come back.

818
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,959
They have identified you as someone
who secretes A-type antibodies...

819
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:47,421
...just like the man who had last been
with Ms. Polhemus.

820
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:50,757
Chances of this being a coincidence
are one in ten.

821
00:59:50,883 --> 00:59:54,928
So, I believe you will be charged
and that you will go to trial.

822
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:59,766
Have you anything to tell this grand jury
about the death of Carolyn Polhemus?

823
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,769
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

824
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:07,399
Wouldn't it be fair to say you were rather
well acquainted with Ms. Polhemus?

825
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,902
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

826
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:12,779
Weren't you, in fact,
intimate with the lady?

827
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:16,992
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

828
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:21,246
You are under arrest.
"You have the right to remain silent.

829
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,333
"Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

830
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:28,128
"You have the right to have a lawyer
present during questioning.

831
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:32,508
"If you cannot hire a lawyer,
one will be appointed to represent you.

832
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:37,429
"You may stop answering questions
at any time."

833
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:40,224
Do you understand the rights
I have explained to you?

834
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:42,392
Call Sandy Stern to make bail.

835
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,992
Sandy should be available in a few hours.

836
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:00,994
Let's see what they got.

837
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:04,164
Can't believe there could be
any more surprises.

838
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:07,584
That's when they come.
That's why they're called surprises.

839
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:13,924
Do we now understand
Della Guardia's case?

840
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:16,844
Yes, I think I do.

841
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:19,596
Let me hear it.

842
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,853
Sabich is obsessed with Polhemus.

843
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,689
She ditches him for another man.

844
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:31,024
Sabich becomes enraged.

845
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,693
He can't let go.

846
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,529
One night, knowing his wife is out...

847
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:38,365
...he calls her and begs her
to see him again.

848
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:40,951
Carolyn finally agrees.

849
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,038
She rolls around with him
for auld lang syne.

850
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,832
Then something goes wrong.

851
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:50,377
Sabich is jealous. He wants more
than she's willing to give.

852
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,254
He blows it.

853
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:55,048
Gives her what for
with some heavy instrument.

854
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:57,593
Decides to make it look like rape.

855
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:01,763
Sabich is a prosecutor,
knows there'll be dozens of suspects.

856
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:03,891
He ties her up.

857
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:07,394
Opens the latches to make it look
like someone slipped in.

858
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:10,981
And this is the diabolical part...

859
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,651
...pulls out her diaphragm
so it looks like rape.

860
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:18,030
But in his haste and confusion,
he makes mistakes.

861
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,991
He forgets the glass he drank from.

862
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:25,287
He doesn't think the forensic chemist
will be able to ID the spermicide.

863
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,582
But we know he did evil to this woman...

864
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:33,295
...because he lied about his presence
in her apartment the night she was killed.

865
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:35,923
His fingerprints on the glass...

866
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,675
...his blood type A identified from semen...

867
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:43,055
...fibers from the carpets in his home,
tell us he was there.

868
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:46,767
Very convincing.

869
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,271
But their evidence of motive is weak.

870
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:53,440
That's where we must attack.

871
01:02:53,899 --> 01:02:58,070
Is there any proof of prior
amorous relationship between the two?

872
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,404
A few telephone calls.

873
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,615
They can be accounted for
by business needs.

874
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:02,950
- Any diary?
- No.

875
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,745
No note that came with flowers?
No lovers' correspondence?

876
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:07,996
- No.
- Good.

877
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,665
Gossip will not be admitted.

878
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:13,752
There are calls from my home to Carolyn's
in October of last year.

879
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,880
You were trying the case
of Wendell McGaffney then.

880
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:18,924
Reason enough for calling her.

881
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:22,344
Why did I tell Lipranzer not to get
my home phone records?

882
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,806
I take it for granted that a person
of an innocent state of mind...

883
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,933
...would rule himself out as a suspect...

884
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:31,019
...and save a busy detective
from wasting time.

885
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:36,275
Clearly, they hope to win the case
on the strength of their physical evidence.

886
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:39,403
I'd like to look at that glass.
It could help me.

887
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,822
List a motion for production
of physical evidence.

888
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,491
I want an inventory of everything
in that apartment.

889
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:46,952
Where's the contraceptive jelly...

890
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:51,039
...the chemist is saying he finds present?
In her medicine cabinet?

891
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:52,583
I don't know.

892
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:57,379
I'll hear worse in court.
