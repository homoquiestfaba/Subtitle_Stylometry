547
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:52,849
Which is that l have to
immediately, um,

548
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:56,986
increase the ad pages here
by 20 percent.

549
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:03,231
20 percent? Carter,
only a startup magazine
can do that.

550
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:06,837
Yeah, well, l think
this team can do it, Dan.

551
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:08,701
Um, how?

552
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,669
Well, Morty,
basically what we--

553
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:13,142
God,
that<i>'</i>s an awesome question.

554

<i>''</i>How?<i>''</i>

555
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:18,509
And the answer

556
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,419
is synergy.

557
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,260
We need to team up here.

558
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,464
Yeah, we need to synchronize

559
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:35,824

560
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,426

568

So?

569
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:59,850
So we talk to
our brothers and sisters
over at Krispity Krunch.

570
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,358
We make a deal
where we supply

571
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,326

to their boxes.

572
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,659

<i>Sports America</i>
Krispity Krunch

575
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,194
He<i>'</i>s definitely buying
more Krispity Krunch

576
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,670
and not Krunch <i>'</i>n Krackle

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,232
which, by the way,
looks and tastes
exactly the same.

578
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,404
But guess what?
No sports factoids.

579
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,574
And Krispity Krunch
is so happy they guarantee us
28 pages a year.

Besides which,

Yes! Factoids! Synergy!

591
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,907
And what else?
Uh, box scores. And ads!

592

like a 100,000 hits

of one ad page

Are you getting it, people?

595
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:58,746

just a portal

596
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,876
to a synergized world
of cross-promotion.

597
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:02,647

in having an awesome wingman.

the benefit for me
at this point in my career

Yeah, l<i>'</i>d rather not get

Didn<i>'</i>t we decide
to let him go?

00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:20,353
Uh, no, we let Enrique Colon
go instead. Remember?

Yeah. That<i>'</i>s right.

Okay. Riff them?

Reduction in forces.
Shitcan them.

Right. Um, but l think

So l don<i>'</i>t think

Well, sooner or later

You know, l<i>'</i>d love to, but l<i>'</i>m

Well, better not, then.

Uh, l<i>'</i>d better

No one.

Hey, sweetheart.
This is Carter Duryea
from the office.

Thank you so much

Baked ziti! Uh, this is...
This is so perfect.

799
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:21,174
That baked ziti.
That<i>'</i>s so...
This is what l need.

800
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:25,086
Like a-- Like a real,
home-cooked thing.

801
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:26,680
This is great.

802
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,250
ls there something wrong
with him?

803
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:30,624
Clearly.

804
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:34,028
Let<i>'</i>s just feed him
and get him the hell
outta here, okay?

805
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:35,793
He<i>'</i>s really young.

806
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,835
He<i>'</i>s a lot younger than you.

807
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:40,462
Yeah. Thank you for that.
Thank you.

808
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:41,698
[chuckling]

809
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:45,142
So, um,
l did the numbers on NYU.

810
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,174
Do you know how expensive
that place is?

811
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,679
Hmm.
Plus living expenses.

812
00:37:49,747 --> 00:37:52,580
Plus Jana<i>'</i>s orthodonture.
Plus baby costs.

813
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,674
Don<i>'</i>t worry about it.

814
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,914
Well, that<i>'</i>s not actually
a solution to a problem.
<i>''</i>Don<i>'</i>t worry about it.<i>''</i>

815
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:59,081
l think we may have to
take out a second mortgage.

816
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:02,854
Why don<i>'</i>t l just go
into the living room
and ask my boss for a raise?

817
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:14,694
Oh, hey.

818
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:16,967
l was, uh, just looking
at you and...

819
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,235
And you<i>'</i>ve...

820
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:19,298
We never got to...

821
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:20,571
That day in the elevator.

822
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:22,010
My name<i>'</i>s Carter Duryea.

823
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,809
Yeah, l know who you are.

824
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:28,650
Does my dad
know you<i>'</i>re here?

825
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,688
Uh, your dad invited
me over for dinner.

826
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:33,255
Technically.

827
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:36,624
Uh, who<i>'</i>s that?

828
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:38,321
Uh, it<i>'</i>s Dad<i>'</i>s new boss.

829
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:40,990
You can<i>'</i>t be Dad<i>'</i>s new boss.
You<i>'</i>re too young.

830
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,664
Yeah, and he<i>'</i>s also
scared shitless.

831
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:45,962
Wow, good memory.

832
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:48,062
And you<i>'</i>re too cute
to be Dad<i>'</i>s boss.

833
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,767
Oh, well, thank you.

834
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:51,866
[phone ringing]

835
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,240
l got it!

836
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:57,545
[sighing]

837
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,320
So, uh, how<i>'</i>s it going?

838
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:05,148
Okay.

839
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:10,350
So what are you
doing here, really?

840
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:16,928
Uh, my wife left me,
and today<i>'</i>s the anniversary
of our first date.

841
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:21,802
l found the idea
of going home
to be so depressing

842
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,736
that l kind of leeched
onto your dad

843
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,243
and invited myself over
for dinner.

844
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:29,139
[snickering]

845
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:33,013
Wow, you<i>'</i>re sort of a
bizarrely honest guy. Huh?

846
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:35,443
No.

847
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:37,746
No. Honestly, l<i>'</i>m...

848
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:38,720
[chuckling]

849
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,688
l<i>'</i>m not.

850
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:41,486
Just around you,
for some reason.

851
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,323
People would probably say
that l<i>'</i>m
an emotionally guarded

852
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,295
anal-retentive asshole.

853
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:53,063
You wanna play foosball?
Okay.

854
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:54,798
Cool, l<i>'</i>ll just change.

855
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,237
Okay.
Good. Yeah.

856
00:39:56,474 --> 00:39:59,739
Do you think Alex could cope
with living in the city
on her own?

857
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:00,800
[sighing]

858
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:03,972
Well, l<i>'</i>m less worried
about her coping with it
than l am about you.

859
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:06,710
Yeah, well, frankly,
l<i>'</i>d rather keep her
under house arrest

860
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:08,718
with a homing device
around her ankle.

861
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:11,346
Then why did you agree to it
without even talking to me?

862
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:12,753
[grunting]

863
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:15,723
And why is your
teenage boss here?

1035
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:43,856
We were bought out last year
by this company called
Continental Brands.

1036
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:46,095
Apparently, the company
that bought us

and the company
that bought you

1038
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:51,633
are having a feud over
wireless communications
in Europe.

1039
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:53,976
Wireless communications?

1040
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:56,604
What--what the hell
does that have to do
with our business?

1041
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,548
Nothing. But we have
this corporate policy now.

1042
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:02,882

Oh, my God! lt<i>'</i>s like
you don<i>'</i>t get it or something.

That was a huge client.

a bottom line here.

l have to increase pages.

1055
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:38,919
We already got Harry, Pete,
and Alicia
on the Ford account.

1056
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:40,616
Morty<i>'</i>s the logical choice.

1057
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:43,387
Oh, and the new woman
at Pepsi thinks
that Louie<i>'</i>s a sexist.

1058
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,052
Guess why.
He called her <i>''</i>sugar tits.<i>''</i>

1059
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:46,426
He<i>'</i>s an idiot.

1060
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:48,761
Come on,
you can<i>'</i>t fire these guys.

1061
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:50,424
These are my guys.

1062
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,435
They<i>'</i>ve been with me
for eight years.

1063
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:54,198
l hired them
at the same time.

1064
00:49:54,271 --> 00:49:55,431
Yeah, l know, Dan.

1065
00:49:55,506 --> 00:49:57,337
That<i>'</i>s why
they have huge,
bloated salaries.

1066
00:49:57,408 --> 00:49:59,933
And they<i>'</i>re not
pulling their weight.

1067
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:01,708
l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1068
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:06,515
Well, l<i>'</i>ve been here

1069
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:10,109
My salary<i>'</i>s
bigger than theirs.
Why don<i>'</i>t you just fire me?

1070
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:12,382
Do you want me to fire you?

1071
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:14,623
Because l could, Dan.

1072
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:16,520
You have
a family that loves you.

1073
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:17,855
You have a kid on the way.

1074

You have people
who need you.

Yeah.
l<i>'</i>ve just, uh...

1174
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:25,322
l<i>'</i>ve always been
interested in stories

1175
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:28,560
and escaping
into other people<i>'</i>s lives.

1176
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,734
l guess <i>'</i>cause
mine always seems so boring.

1177
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:34,196
l<i>'</i>m cursed with
a functional family.

1178

But writing
isn<i>'</i>t exactly practical.

1179
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:39,571
So l think
l might double major
in business.

00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:41,975
Oh, no. Don<i>'</i>t do that.

She<i>'</i>s this kind of hippie.

1191

So she<i>'</i>s not really into
the corporate thing.

1192
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:14,809
And my dad left home
when l was 4,

1193

so, you know,
l never really
got to know him.

1194

His family had money,

1195
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:22,246
but, uh,

1537
01:16:38,574 --> 01:16:40,906
What do you want me to say,
Dad?

1538
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:47,246
[sighs]

1539
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:48,911
Get up.

1540
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:50,643
What?

1541
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,016
Get up.

1542
01:16:57,593 --> 01:16:58,651
Dad!

1543
01:16:58,727 --> 01:17:00,786
Pardon me, sir,
but l don<i>'</i>t think
you should treat--

1544
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:04,390
Back off,
before l drop-kick you
across this restaurant.

1545
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:07,763
You are a piece of shit!

1546
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:09,064
Dan, l love her.

1547
01:17:09,138 --> 01:17:10,469
You what?

1548
01:17:11,407 --> 01:17:12,806
l love her.

1549
01:17:13,075 --> 01:17:14,667
[Carter panting]

1550
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:17,777
l love you.

1551
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:21,883
You love her?
She<i>'</i>s my daughter.

1552
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:25,413
She<i>'</i>s in college.
She<i>'</i>s a college student.

1553
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:28,320
l took out
a fricking second mortgage
so she could go.

1554
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,654
Three years ago
she was in braces.

1555
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:33,660
l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1556
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:39,230
This guy.

1557
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:41,669
You had to sleep with him?

1558
01:17:41,737 --> 01:17:43,034
Dad, l...

1559
01:17:43,672 --> 01:17:44,934
Dad...

1560
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:48,903
(Alex)
Dad.

[groans]

1562
01:17:51,113 --> 01:17:52,444
Dad! Wait, l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1563
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:54,277
This had nothing
to do with you.

1564
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:55,783
He<i>'</i>s my boss, Alex.

1565
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:58,547
l know.
But it just happened.

1566
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:01,146
We made a deal,
remember?

1567
01:18:01,523 --> 01:18:04,424
We made a deal
we<i>'</i>d always be honest
with one another.

1568
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:07,257
Dad, l was like 5 years old
when we made that deal.

1569
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:09,559
Yeah.
l liked you better then.

1570
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:11,923
That<i>'</i>s awful.

1571
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:15,466
That<i>'</i>s an awful thing
to say.

1572
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,562
Dad, please don<i>'</i>t walk away.
l want to talk to you.

1573
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,767
Why?
You don<i>'</i>t need my advice
about anything.

1574
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:43,988
[door opening]

1575
01:18:44,566 --> 01:18:45,692
Hey, you.

1576
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:46,860
Hey.

1577
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:49,460
Hey, Carter.
Wow, that<i>'</i>s some shiner.

1578
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:51,128
Thanks.

1579
01:18:51,507 --> 01:18:54,101
Maya, could we have
some privacy, please?

1580
01:18:54,176 --> 01:18:56,303
Sure. Absolutely.

1581
01:19:00,382 --> 01:19:01,679
[growls]

1582
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:07,913
Sit down.

1583
01:19:09,825 --> 01:19:11,793
Hey, can l get you some ice
for that?

1584
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,691
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

1585
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:17,890
[clears throat]

1586
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,831
Um, there<i>'</i>s no ice.

1587
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:22,400
But the soda<i>'</i>s cold.

1588
01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:24,328
Oh, thanks.

1589
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:30,501
Look, l wanted to apologize,
uh, for my timing when...

1590
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,314
Uh, with the <i>''</i>L<i>''</i> word.

1591
01:19:33,382 --> 01:19:35,350
lt just kind of slipped out.

1592
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:37,817
But l<i>'</i>ve been thinking
about it a lot lately,

1593
01:19:37,886 --> 01:19:40,650
and it<i>'</i>s how l feel.
lt<i>'</i>s really important to me--

1594
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:42,883
Oh, that<i>'</i>s really sweet.

1595
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:48,356
Well, l mean it.

1596
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:54,130
l know
you probably think you do.

1597
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:58,533
But l-l<i>'</i>ve been doing
a lot of thinking, too,

1598
01:19:58,607 --> 01:20:00,666
and l<i>'</i>m

1599
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:04,913
taking
anthropology classes.

1600
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,607
And l<i>'</i>m doing a double major.

1601
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:07,808
Yeah.

1602
01:20:07,883 --> 01:20:10,408
And l<i>'</i>m just...
l<i>'</i>m really busy.

1603
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:12,611
Yeah.
Uh, l<i>'</i>m just not...

1604
01:20:13,922 --> 01:20:16,413
l<i>'</i>m not ready
for a big commitment.

1605
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:17,784
Yes, that<i>'</i>s...

1606
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:20,351
[chuckles]
That<i>'</i>s what l<i>'</i>m saying.

1607
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:24,031
[sighs]

1608
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:28,936
Look, when l said
l loved you,

1609
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:33,202
l didn<i>'</i>t mean
that l wanted to
interfere in your classes

1610
01:20:33,275 --> 01:20:35,835
or, you know, whatever.

1611
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:40,780
l<i>'</i>m not talking
about marriage
or anything yet.

1612
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:43,443
Carter. Look.

1613
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:46,654
l<i>'</i>ve had an amazing time
with you,

1614
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:48,952
and l think
you<i>'</i>re a great guy.

1615
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:52,719
But you are on the rebound.

1616
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:54,153
No, l<i>'</i>m not.

1617
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:55,856
Carter, you are.

1618
01:20:55,931 --> 01:20:59,458
l mean,
it was not that long ago
that your wife left you.

1619
01:20:59,535 --> 01:21:01,560
Best thing
that ever happened to me.

1620
01:21:01,637 --> 01:21:03,400
Well, that<i>'</i>s great.

1621
01:21:08,177 --> 01:21:11,908
But then that<i>'</i>s a good thing
whether you<i>'</i>re with me or not.

1622
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:14,346
l think we should stop
seeing each other.

1623
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:15,942
Alex.

1624
01:21:18,487 --> 01:21:20,387
[laughs]
Alex, come on.

1625
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:33,959
l just want you to know

1626
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:38,698
l enjoyed talking to you
more than

1627
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:41,640
maybe anyone
in my entire life.

1628
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,445
Thank you.

1629
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:50,481

1631
01:22:10,839 --> 01:22:12,136
Dad,
where have you been?

1632
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:13,401
Your cell phone was off.

1633
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:15,375
l tried to call you
like a thousand times.

1634
01:22:15,444 --> 01:22:16,775
What happened?
Where<i>'</i>s your mom?

1635
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:35,558
(Ann)
There you are.

1636
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:37,397
Are you okay?

1637
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,494
l<i>'</i>m fine. Yes, l<i>'</i>m fine.

1638
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:41,229
The baby<i>'</i>s fine.

1639
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:44,097
l had a little scare.

1640
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:46,234
There was some bleeding.

1641
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:48,904
What? What is it?

1642
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:51,240
A placenta previa.

1643
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,645
lt sounds bad,
but, uh, it<i>'</i>s okay.

1644
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:55,876
[chuckles]

1645
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:57,885
l just need some rest.

1646
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:02,250
lf anything
ever happened to you,
l<i>'</i>d just have to pack it in.

1647
01:23:02,324 --> 01:23:06,055
Oh, l<i>'</i>m afraid
you<i>'</i>re going to be
stuck with me for a while.

1648
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:12,591

How<i>'</i>s she doing?

1651
01:23:18,106 --> 01:23:19,471
She<i>'</i>s okay.

1652
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:31,484
You know,
l broke up with Carter.

1653
01:23:34,923 --> 01:23:36,015
Because of me?

1654
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:38,457
No. Because of me.

1655
01:23:44,366 --> 01:23:46,391
l<i>'</i>m sorry l lied to you.

1656
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:51,336
But, you know,
l think you should know

1657
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,931
that Carter didn<i>'</i>t try
to seduce me
or anything.

1658
01:23:54,009 --> 01:23:55,806
lf anything,
it was the other way around.

1659
01:23:55,877 --> 01:23:58,505
l really don<i>'</i>t want
to hear the details.

1660
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,638
[grunts]

1661
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:03,981
l mean,
unless you want to
tell me, and...

1662
01:24:04,386 --> 01:24:06,479
No. No, not particularly.

1663
01:24:06,688 --> 01:24:07,882
Good.

1664
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:10,920
[sighs]

1665
01:24:11,993 --> 01:24:14,291
You must think
l<i>'</i>m disgusting.

1666
01:24:14,396 --> 01:24:15,886
Disgusting?

1667
01:24:17,032 --> 01:24:19,330
Why on earth
would l think that?

1668
01:24:19,401 --> 01:24:22,598
l didn<i>'</i>t know
that you took out
a second mortgage.

1669

l don<i>'</i>t need to go to NYU.

SUNY<i>'</i>s fine.
lt<i>'</i>s fine.

1671
01:24:26,174 --> 01:24:28,506
No, no,
you are staying at NYU.

1672
01:24:31,813 --> 01:24:33,212
Look, Alex.

1673
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:39,852
You<i>'</i>re a really smart woman.

1674
01:24:41,556 --> 01:24:43,649
And you can take care
of yourself.

1675
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:46,421
And l<i>'</i>m going to try

1676
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,697
and adjust.

1677
01:24:52,067 --> 01:24:54,297
You don<i>'</i>t have to change,
Dad.

1678
01:24:57,906 --> 01:25:00,739
Yeah. l do.

Good to see you.

Hi. Oh, nice brooch.

Thank you, sir.

1686
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:38,545
Must be paying her
too much money.

Mark Steckle.
Hi.

1688
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:42,745
Ah, Mark Steckle,

1689
01:25:42,818 --> 01:25:44,410
Very psyched.
How<i>'</i>s it going?

Very good.
Good, good.

1691

Right this way.

Oh, yes. Cell phones.

Yes. Thank you.

Well, that<i>'</i>s the flagship.

01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,698
What happened to your eye?

1701
01:26:07,309 --> 01:26:09,368
Yeah, what happened there?

1702
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:13,244
l fell--
l fell asleep at my computer.

1703
01:26:13,315 --> 01:26:16,182
Just kind of
banged right into the monitor.

1704
01:26:16,818 --> 01:26:18,581
Those things
can be dangerous.

Keep up the good work.

01:26:25,193 --> 01:26:27,457
if he announces
another big takeover today.

1709
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:28,826
Teddy K.!

1710
01:26:33,768 --> 01:26:35,861
(Teddy K.)
Great to see you. Thank you.

1711
01:26:37,806 --> 01:26:39,637
(Teddy K.)
Thank you.

1712
01:26:40,942 --> 01:26:44,605
Synergy. What does it mean?

1713
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:48,706
(Teddy K.)
Why does a business
swim with it

1714
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:50,250
and sink without it,

1715
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:52,548
in this new ocean
of megabytes,

1716
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:54,987
streaming video
and satellites?

1717
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,520
Every day,

1718
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,924
the world becomes
more complex.

1719
01:27:00,362 --> 01:27:03,024
And to survive
in a complex world,

1720
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:06,534
we need complex bonds
to interface with it.

1721
01:27:09,037 --> 01:27:10,834
ln this room,

1722
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,341
l see this.

1723
01:27:20,048 --> 01:27:24,144
What we<i>'</i>re trying to get to,
is this.

1724
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:28,419
(Teddy K.)
This is unbreakable.

1725
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:32,556
This is inevitable.

1726
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,691
(Teddy K.)
What are we building here?
ls it a company?

1727
01:27:38,767 --> 01:27:42,567
Or are we building
a new country
with no national boundaries?

1728
01:27:43,038 --> 01:27:45,472
A new democracy
for the consumer.

1729
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,270
A new democracy
with a new electorate.

1730
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:52,473
24-hour music videos
in Kuala Lumpur.

1731
01:27:52,547 --> 01:27:55,448
Computers with parts
manufactured in Japan,

1732
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:57,542
Greenland, ldaho, lndia.

1733
01:27:58,019 --> 01:28:00,783
A soft drink ad
going out simultaneously

1734
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:03,115
to seven different continents.

1735
01:28:03,391 --> 01:28:06,554
The Dalai Llama
eating his Krispity Krunch

1736
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:09,222
while uploading prayers
onto the Net.

1737
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:12,432
<i>Woman's World</i> magazine.

1738
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,958
Well, why not
Woman<i>'</i>s World Channel
across the world?

1739
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:17,265
Computers.

1740
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:21,207
Why not a computer section
in <i>Sports America</i> magazine?

1741
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:22,776
[chuckles]

1742
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:26,678
(Dan)
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

1743
01:28:28,516 --> 01:28:29,608
Yes?

1744
01:28:29,918 --> 01:28:31,180
Uh, uh...

1745
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:35,218
Uh, my name is, uh, uh,
Dan Foreman. l...

1746
01:28:35,423 --> 01:28:39,689
l work for <i>Sports America</i>
and l<i>'</i>m not sure

1747
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:42,628
l--l understand
what you<i>'</i>re talking about.

1748
01:28:44,933 --> 01:28:47,026
(Dan)
W-what l mean is--is

1749
01:28:48,603 --> 01:28:51,037
what do computers have to do
with sports?

1750
01:28:51,106 --> 01:28:53,631
Are you...
Are--are you literally saying

1751
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:56,199
that there should be
a section in the magazine

1752
01:28:56,277 --> 01:28:57,938
about computers?

1753
01:28:59,247 --> 01:29:01,613
Who<i>'</i>s going to want to
read that?

1754
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:07,481
Um...

1755
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:09,550
[clears throat]
And, uh...

1756
01:29:09,624 --> 01:29:10,682
[sighs]

1757
01:29:10,759 --> 01:29:12,590
l-l<i>'</i>m not sure
l understand

1758
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:14,652
how the way
the world is changing

1759
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:17,493
is actually going to change
how we do business.

1760
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:21,763
We<i>'</i>re still selling
a product, right?

1761
01:29:21,836 --> 01:29:23,963
Which hopefully
someone needs.

1762
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:27,099
We<i>'</i>re human beings
with other human beings
for customers.

1763
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:31,441
So l don<i>'</i>t see how
this company is like
its own country.

1764
01:29:31,513 --> 01:29:34,744
l mean,
just because we sell
different kinds of things,

1765
01:29:34,816 --> 01:29:38,616
that doesn<i>'</i>t mean
we should operate
by our own laws, does it?

1766
01:29:40,388 --> 01:29:44,256
Besides which, countries,
at least democratic ones,

1767
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,287
they have some obligation
to their citizens,
don<i>'</i>t they?

1768
01:29:49,831 --> 01:29:51,731
(Dan)
So how do layoffs

1769
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,662
and bottom line thinking
fit into that?

1770
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:09,983
Dan Foreman.

1771
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,478
<i>Sports America.</i>

1772
01:30:15,523 --> 01:30:18,754
You ask
some excellent questions.

1773
01:30:18,827 --> 01:30:21,125
Excellent,
excellent questions.

1774
01:30:21,763 --> 01:30:23,788
l<i>'</i>m glad you asked them.

1775
01:30:26,835 --> 01:30:28,996
And l<i>'</i>m leaving it to you,

1776
01:30:29,771 --> 01:30:32,740
to all of you,
to answer them.

1777
01:30:38,379 --> 01:30:39,505
Hmm.

1778
01:30:48,623 --> 01:30:49,885
Teddy K.!

1779
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:53,559
(Steckle)
Teddy K.! Teddy K.!

1780
01:30:57,599 --> 01:30:59,658
(Carter)
Oh, my God, Dan.
Oh, my God.

1781
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:01,326
(Steckle)
Good, you<i>'</i>re both in here.

1782
01:31:01,402 --> 01:31:02,960
You,
l<i>'</i>ll talk to in a second.

1783
01:31:03,037 --> 01:31:05,699
You, have you lost
your frigging mind?

1784
01:31:06,141 --> 01:31:09,008
Well, he said
they were excellent questions.

1785
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:11,102
Okay,
you think this is funny.

1786
01:31:11,179 --> 01:31:13,977
You think it<i>'</i>s funny
to disrespect a great man.

1787
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,278
Do you know
who you were just talking to
in there?

1788
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:19,184
That was Teddy K.!
Teddy K., God damn it!

1789
01:31:20,555 --> 01:31:21,988
Look,
we<i>'</i>ve been carrying

1790
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:23,990
your fat, bloated salary
for way too long.

1791
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:25,821
(Steckle)
l want you
out of this building

1792
01:31:25,894 --> 01:31:26,952
within the next
10 minutes.

1793
01:31:27,028 --> 01:31:28,427
l<i>'</i>m going to my office.

1794
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:30,088
l<i>'</i>m going to smoke
a nice Cuban cigar

1795
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:31,962
and try to forget
that you ever existed.

1796
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:33,864
You, in my office now.

1797
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:35,698
Mark, don<i>'</i>t do that.

1798
01:31:37,338 --> 01:31:38,464
Excuse me?

1799
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:39,666
Look.

1800
01:31:39,774 --> 01:31:41,139
The guy busts his ass and--

1801
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:42,301
And what?

1802
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:44,208
Nothing. l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1803
01:31:45,914 --> 01:31:49,145
(Carter)
l just... lf you fire him,

1804
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:55,314
you<i>'</i>re going to have to
fire me, too.

1805
01:31:58,459 --> 01:31:59,585
Wait.

1806
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:02,022
Let me get something
straight here.

1807
01:32:02,096 --> 01:32:04,394
You<i>'</i>re throwing yourself in
with him?

1808
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:07,491
With this useless,
over-the-hill loser?

1809
01:32:07,569 --> 01:32:09,628
Think here.
Think about what you<i>'</i>re doing,

1810
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:13,333
because if you<i>'</i>re not careful,
you could end up like him.

1811
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:17,606
l guess that
that would be okay.

1812
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,549
All right.

1813
01:32:23,785 --> 01:32:26,185
Then you<i>'</i>re fired, too,
you little shit.

1814
01:32:27,622 --> 01:32:28,680
Well, that<i>'</i>s too bad,

1815
01:32:28,756 --> 01:32:32,192
<i>'</i>cause, uh, you<i>'</i>re gonna lose
a huge account that
Dan and l<i>'</i>ve been working on.

1816
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,659
lt was gonna save
the year for us.

1817
01:32:33,728 --> 01:32:35,753
Without it,
the magazine<i>'</i>s
pretty deep in the red.

1818
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,627
Really? What account is that?

1819
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:39,428
You think
we<i>'</i>d actually tell you?

1820
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:45,198
You<i>'</i>re bluffing.

1821
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:46,830
l don<i>'</i>t bluff.

1822
01:32:47,008 --> 01:32:48,498
l<i>'</i>m not
that good of a salesman.

1823
01:32:53,081 --> 01:32:55,106
Yeah, well,
l don<i>'</i>t give a crap.

1824
01:32:55,183 --> 01:32:56,445
l think Teddy K. will.

1825
01:32:56,517 --> 01:32:58,644
See, l<i>'</i>m gonna call him
and l<i>'</i>m gonna tell him

1826
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,245
that you single-handedly drove
his most profitable magazine,

1827
01:33:01,322 --> 01:33:03,847
his flagship,
right into the ground.

1828
01:33:04,592 --> 01:33:06,116
And he<i>'</i>ll remember my name.

1829
01:33:06,194 --> 01:33:07,957
He likes
what l did with cell phones.

1830
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,604
You<i>'</i>ve got 24 hours,
or you<i>'</i>re both gone.

1831
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:25,741
[sighs]

1832
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:29,815
Any ideas?

1833
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:32,245
One.

1834
01:33:50,104 --> 01:33:51,594
You got
all your research?

1835
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:52,765
Yep.

1836
01:33:53,975 --> 01:33:55,533
Follow my lead.

1837
01:33:57,478 --> 01:33:59,173
(Kalb)
So, um,
how are your daughters?

1838
01:33:59,247 --> 01:34:00,908
They<i>'</i>re great. Thanks.

1839
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:02,313
How about
your grandkids?

1840
01:34:02,383 --> 01:34:03,577
Uh, they<i>'</i>re fine.

1841
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:06,279
My son-in-law
has just enrolled our oldest,
Ralphy,

1842
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:09,380
in a computer camp,
whatever the hell that is.

1843
01:34:10,425 --> 01:34:12,586
Uh, this is my boss,
Carter Duryea.

1844
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,821
lt<i>'</i>s a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Kalb.

1845
01:34:14,896 --> 01:34:16,887
You have
a really awesome company
here.

1846
01:34:16,965 --> 01:34:19,126
You...
lt<i>'</i>s a really awesome,
awesome--

1847
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,998
Your boss?
He looks more like
your nephew.

1848
01:34:22,637 --> 01:34:25,231
Well, l<i>'</i>ve, uh, certainly been
learning a lot from Dan.

1849
01:34:25,306 --> 01:34:27,001
So what happened to your eye?

1850
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,635
That<i>'</i>s one of the things
he learned from me.

1851
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:33,078
Are you saying
that you punched him
in the eye? Why?

1852
01:34:33,147 --> 01:34:36,776
Well, it<i>'</i>s...
We don<i>'</i>t have to
really go into it here.

1853
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:40,480
No, no, no, please, please.
l<i>'</i>m--l<i>'</i>m--l<i>'</i>m rather curious.

1854
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:43,418
Why did l hit you?

1855
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:50,458
He called me
a dinosaur.

1856
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:51,998
He said
l was out of date.

1857
01:34:52,066 --> 01:34:54,557
That l<i>'</i>d better
step in line.

1858
01:34:55,703 --> 01:34:57,330
So you slugged him?

1859
01:34:57,405 --> 01:34:59,430
lt was a fair fight.
Hmm?

1860
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,035
Right.

1861
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:07,277
Mr. Kalb,
we have a sister company,
Krispity Krunch,

1862
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:10,181
that l think we could do
a really exciting
cross-promotion with here,

1863
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:12,116
all in the GlobeCom family.
Carter, Carter.

1864
01:35:12,186 --> 01:35:13,483
l think that we
could achieve--

1865
01:35:13,554 --> 01:35:14,851
Carter, it<i>'</i>s ok.
Mr. Kalb,

1866
01:35:14,922 --> 01:35:18,323
l don<i>'</i>t want get into facts
and figures with you today.
You know them already.

1867
01:35:18,393 --> 01:35:20,122
(Dan)
l just want to ask you
one question.

1868
01:35:20,194 --> 01:35:21,354
What is your hesitation

1869
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:24,489
about advertising
with <i>Sports America</i> magazine?

1870
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:31,500
My hesitation is
that our ad budget
is already overextended.

1871
01:35:31,706 --> 01:35:35,301
My son-in-law has put
a lot of money
into cable and online.

1872
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:39,210
And now he wants to plow
even more money back into it.
But...

1873
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,745

Yeah. Carter.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

God,
that was actually fun.

What Kalb
really needed to see

what the best thing is?

lt<i>'</i>s the right thing to do.

Of course l do.

Teddy K. was buying

# <i>By the rose bush</i> #

2046
01:45:52,993 --> 01:45:57,930
# <i>Laughing with roses</i>

2047
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,734
# <i>The time when</i> #

2048
01:46:03,137 --> 01:46:06,129
# <i>we counted every black car</i> #

2049
01:46:06,206 --> 01:46:10,700
# <i>passing your house</i>
<i>beneath the hill</i> #

2050
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:14,572
# <i>and up until</i> #

2051
01:46:15,816 --> 01:46:19,149
# <i>someone caught us</i>

2052
01:46:19,653 --> 01:46:22,019
# <i>with knives</i> #

2053
01:46:22,122 --> 01:46:24,181
# <i>A mountain range</i> #

2054
01:46:25,426 --> 01:46:27,792
# <i>A piggy bank</i> #

2055
01:46:28,729 --> 01:46:32,392
# <i>A vision to removed</i>
<i>to mention</i> #

2056
01:46:32,466 --> 01:46:36,994
# <i>But, please,</i>
<i>remember me</i> #

2059
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:47,076
# <i>And then</i> #

2060
01:46:47,147 --> 01:46:49,513
# <i>they went on to say</i> #

2061
01:46:50,384 --> 01:46:53,114
# <i>that the pearly gates</i> #

2062
01:46:54,254 --> 01:46:58,088
# <i>are so eloquently repeated</i> #

2063
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:03,027

2064
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:06,263
# <i>And don't look down</i> #

2065
01:47:06,734 --> 01:47:11,171

2066
01:47:11,238 --> 01:47:12,865
# <i>And, please</i> #

2067
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:17,570
# <i>remember me silently</i> #

2068
01:47:19,446 --> 01:47:23,542
# <i>ln the car</i>
<i>behind the corner</i> #

2069
01:47:23,851 --> 01:47:25,512
# <i>you hold my hand</i> #

2070
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:28,780
# <i>between your knees</i> #

2071
01:47:28,856 --> 01:47:31,381
# <i>You turn from me</i> #

2072
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:36,425
# <i>Said the trapeze,</i>

2073
01:47:36,497 --> 01:47:40,900
# <i>But never</i>

2074
01:47:41,535 --> 01:47:44,766
# <i>The clouds</i>
<i>have passed</i> #

2075
01:47:44,838 --> 01:47:47,966
# <i>So we just come up</i>
<i>with anger</i> #

2076
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:50,839
# <i>And then</i> #

2077
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:53,880
# <i>The circus moved</i> #

2078
01:47:53,947 --> 01:47:57,348
# <i>The parking lot</i> #

2079
01:47:57,618 --> 01:48:01,247
# <i>Hiding out,</i>
<i>a hint of danger</i> #

2080
01:48:01,321 --> 01:48:05,519
# <i>So, please, remember me</i> #

2081
01:48:06,727 --> 01:48:09,491
# <i>fondly</i> #

2082
01:48:09,997 --> 01:48:14,934

2086
01:48:28,949 --> 01:48:31,975
# <i>And Lucifer</i> #

2087
01:48:32,052 --> 01:48:35,146
# <i>A boy and girl</i> #

2088
01:48:35,222 --> 01:48:40,125
# <i>An angel kissin'</i>

2089
01:48:41,495 --> 01:48:44,293
# <i>The aftermath</i> #

2090
01:48:44,698 --> 01:48:48,099
# <i>A marching band</i> #

2091
01:48:48,202 --> 01:48:52,730
# <i>All around the fray</i>
<i>just trapeze swinging</i> ##
