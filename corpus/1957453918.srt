Hi, Mom it's Josh.

10
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,778
Obviously, got your message.

11
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,614
Just been practicing.

12
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,450
I know, surprise, right?

13
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,522
Um, anyway, the piece
is really shaping up.

14
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,923
Can't wait to play it for you.

15
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,424
I can't really get there

16
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,861
before morning, so hopefully it
can wait.

17
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,630
Um, okay, see you for breakfast.

18
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,532
Love you.

[peddle thudding]

21
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:01,582
- Good morning, Charlotte.
- Morning.

22
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,951
- Where are you going now?
- Just going.

23
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,687
- You're always going.
- What can I say?

24
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,954
I'm busy.

25
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:09,724
[Corinna sighs]

26
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:14,294
Happy birthday, Grandma.

27
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,763
- Coconut chocolate?
- Of course.

28
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:16,664
Oh!

29
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,433
When are you going to
sit down and practice?

30
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,868
You're welcome.

31
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,436
Thank you, dear.

32
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,838
When are you going to practice?

33
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,338
January.

34
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,974
Show me your hands.

35
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,547
These fingers have not touched
the piano.

36
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,480
- All up here.
- Oh!

37
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,850
All up here. [speaks in foreign
language]

38
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,787
Internet is ruining your work
ethic, everything is too easy.

39
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,823
It is Grandma, especially
that pest, YouTube,

40
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:43,558
filling our brains with
infinite amounts of information.

41
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,526
I'm surprised you have
any brain left at all.

42
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,894
Grandma, why are you on my
case?

43
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:49,697
[Corinna sighs]

44
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,899
Got it, I promise.

45
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,735
Go, prove it to me.

[bright piano music]

47
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:17,558
It's tomorrow, yes?

48
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,493
Whatever happens, happens.

49
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,394
Up against some tough pianists.

50
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,798
That's never stopped you
before.

51
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,934
Back in my day, we just made
music.

52
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,036
We didn't have to compete to
earn a living for ourselves.

53
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,004
I know, I know.

54
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,807
"Competition's are for
horses not artists."

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,843
- Who said that?
- Your grandpa. [chuckles]

56
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,945
But Bartok said at first,

57
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,817
If you are going to have to
compete to earn your supper,

58
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,619
you've got to commit.

59
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,023
You will be up against
kids that eat, drink,

60
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,794
and sleep with Bach,
Beethoven and Horowitz.

61
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,796
- [laughs] Grandma.
- Laugh all you want,

62
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:58,733
but I know that Victor Zabov
has a new favorite to win.

63
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,869
Uh, Jake or Josh or something.

64
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:05,706
A favorite, it's not a horse
race.

65
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,108
And what do you mean, you heard?

66
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,510
My musical school is a
hot topic at bridge club?

67
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:11,879
This is serious, believe me.

68
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:13,981
Zabov knows all the tricks.

69
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,483
Please, if there was
someone of that caliber,

70
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,519
- I'd know about him.
- You can't just

71
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:21,022
float through this one.

72
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,990
I don't think I'm going to
compete.

73
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,759
Yes you are.

74
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,359
And besides, if I'm there
too long then who's gonna

75
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,996
- take care of you?
- You don't worry about me.

76
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,498
You just get yourself ready.

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,868
I've never asked you for
anything,

78
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:37,038
but I am asking you to
take this one seriously.

79
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,107
- Grandma, don't get all-
- Charlotte,

80
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,910
I've got to know you'll
be okay after I die.

81
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:45,445
- Grandma, stop.
- I've got to know.

82
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,914
I need to know.

83
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,381
It's just the competition.

84
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,885
We both know that's not true.

[soft piano music]

86
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,105
You remind me of your mother.

87
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,474
Naturally gifted, incredibly
stubborn.

88
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:21,582
You're going to win that
competition tomorrow.

89
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:23,416
And she'd be so proud.

Yeah, it was, I'll give you
that.

99
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,213
- When am I gonna see you?
- Oh, gosh, soon.

100
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,214
- I'm here.
- Yeah?

101
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,582
- I'm here.
- All right.

102
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:02,950
[Man] I'm back.

103
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,920
- Mm!
- So good to see you.

104
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,489
- Good to see you.
- It's good to be back.

105
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,527
Hey, Josh!

106
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,930
Josh, wait up!

00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,898
[bike rattling]

108
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:18,799
Josh!

[dog barking]

110
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,273
What do you want?

111
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,644
Just a moment to talk with my
son.

112
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,014
You're 20 years too late.

113
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,783
I know, but I'm back for good,
I swear.

114
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:36,884
I'm here for good.

115
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,120
I can't deal with this right
now.

116
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:40,821
Josh, Josh, stop!

00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,694

119
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,235
Thank you.

120
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,104
Thank you.

121
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,776
Your mom tells me about the
competition.

122
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,311
She says every pianist who's won

123
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:07,648
goes on to have lucrative
careers.

124
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,283
That's exciting.

125
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,851
I'm proud of you.

126
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:17,224
Hey, you know, it would mean
a lot to me if you'd come by.

127
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:22,063
It's no big London
competition, but it's a start.

128
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,298
For me to be here for good.

129
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:31,806
You would name an entire
gallery after yourself.

130
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,278

Good morning, Barbara.
[door closes]

134
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,126
How you doing, you look well
today.

135
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,261
Uh, thank you, your
mom's in the kitchen.

136
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:55,262
Thanks.

137
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:57,665
[pills rattling]

138
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:02,203
Ew, boy, when was the
last time you showered?

139
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:05,306
You can't keep a schedule like
this without getting sick.

140
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,276
You need sleep and food that
doesn't come from a paper bag.

141
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,045
Why do you give him the time
of day?

142
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,713
How did he even know where to
find you?

143
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,681
- Josh.
- And you're okay with that?

144
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,349
You can just pick up
right where you left off

145
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,985
whenever he feels like showing
up?

146
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,688
There are things you
don't understand yet.

147
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,723
And I don't like what's
been happening to you.

148
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,725
You're in the practice room day
and night.

149
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:25,960
It's not healthy.

150
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:30,998
Look at you, how many hours
a week are you working now?

151
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:32,800
I do it for you.

152
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:36,270
I'm going to make things better
for you.

153
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,106
He's your father, you need
him.

154
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,111
I forgot, look what I have.

155
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,115
And it's not your
job to take care of me.

156
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,016
Mom.

157
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,286
[laughs] A real Broadway show!

158
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,288
Uh, touring, but yeah.

159
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:59,460
People change, Josh.

160
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,429
Take Barbara, you know, it'll
be fun.

161
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,231
You're coming, right?

162
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,933
I have to work tonight.

163
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:10,104
Not to his thing,
tomorrow, the competition.

164
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,139
- I have to work, sweetie.
- Okay, my point exactly.

165
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,042
I don't like how much
you're working lately.

166
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,044
I keep telling you, I could get
a job.

167
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,145
It might be nice change.

168
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,481
We're not gonna get into this
again.

169
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:23,017
Getting through school is your
job,

170
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,986
putting you through school is
mine.

171
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,923
So many rich people go to that
school.

172
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,859
And maybe I could find you
some new clients, you know?

173
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,360
One of them would equal three
Barbaras.

174
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:35,062
Watch your mouth!

175
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:40,401
Those people don't need me,
the Barbaras of the world do.

176
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,770
I'm going to win for us.

177
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,975
[sighs] Come say hi to
Barbara.

178
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,010
Mm, I need to get back to
practice.

179
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:53,847
Boy, you better get
in there and say hello.

180
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,985
So I understand you're leaving
us.

181
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,987
Hope so, especially now.

182
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,991
Well, you win and you
get to see the whole world.

183
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,426
And take your mom with you.

184
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,961
Yes, that's the point.

185
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,096
Stop, both of you.

186
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,265
If I win, you're coming with
me.

187
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,536
Otherwise, all my hard work
will have been for nothing.

188
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,504
[Barbara chuckling]
Am I doing mom-guilt properly?

189
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:18,405
Yes, very well done. [laughs]

190
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,206
Hmm.

191
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,842
Did you see your father
earlier?

192
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,145
Barbara, how did you know
that was Josh's father?

193
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,114
I'm old, not dumb.

194
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,283
They are the spitting
image of one another.

195
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,818
Yeah, well looks are
all we have in common.

196
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,519
Josh!

197
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,292
Take a shower and go to bed.
[Josh sighs]

198
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,794
All right, peace and blessings.

199
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:43,464
- Bye, Barbara.
- Good luck, Maestro.

200
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:44,832
[bell ringing]

201
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:48,002
[students chattering]

202
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,506
[door opens]

203
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,110
[door closes]

204
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,078
Is it too much to ask

205
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,518
that one of you will be at
the piano when class begins?

206
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:06,020
A little enthusiasm, people.

207
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,557
Beatrice, Beatrice.

208
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,527
Let's hear your Beethoven.

209
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,162
Yes, Mr. Dempster, yes, sir.

210
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:23,937
[dramatic piano music]

211
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:38,352
[door opens and closes]

212
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:46,260
[chair clicks]

213
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:01,075
I think we've heard enough.

214
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:08,382
You all have smartphones, right?

215
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:14,088
I've been reading about apps
lately.

216
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,023
I've heard they have one
were you can keep track

217
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,593
of how many hours you practice.

218
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,427
Um, would anyone like

219
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:25,399
to volunteer to help me download
an app?

220
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,300
You, sir.

221
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,470
You can leave now.

222
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,573
You seem so much more
enthusiastic

223
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:35,442
about this technology
than you do the music.

224
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:36,477
I'm serious!

225
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:42,650
I don't have room in this
class for dilettantes!

226
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,155
If any of the rest of you

227
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,691
would rather play with your
phones,

228
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:52,393
you're free to go with him!

229
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,495
[door opens]
I don't care

230
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:57,030
if you know how to download an
app!

231
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:00,100
Just like I don't care if you
have

232
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,669
[phone buzzing]
rehearsals scheduled

233
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,605
or classwork to do.

234
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:07,642
And I particularly don't care,
if you have a social life!

235
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,978
You're all here for one thing,
the music!

236
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,615
Oh, and for those of you
that have been chosen

237
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:16,116
for the final round of the
competition,

238
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,519
the only thing you'll be doing

239
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:20,454
between now and tomorrow is
practicing!

240
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,257
You've never experienced this
kind

241
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,260
of competition with these kinds
of stakes!

242
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,162
Nerves will take over!

243
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:34,468
London Prize only comes
around once every five years.

244
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,739
So you won't get another shot!

245
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:39,373
Josh, you're next.

246
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,326
[dramatic piano music]

247
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:30,123
You think you're expressing
innocence, but it's not working.

248
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,597
You need to play this
piece from the viewpoint

249
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,734
of an old man, as though
he's remembering his youth.

250
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,302
Listen to yourself, dig deep.

251
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:47,107
Let me hear you as if
you were 70, understand?

252
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:52,814
Now, go practice, you all
know what you need to do.

253
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:56,316
It's been years to this point,
folks.

254
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,286
And now it's tomorrow night.

255
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,324
If you've made it this far,
you have what it takes to win.

256
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:05,760
[bell ringing]
Although I'm starting

257
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:08,395
to wonder if it's all a fluke.

258
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:14,669
Come on.

259
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,776
[door closes]

260
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,479
[dramatic piano music]

261
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:28,516
[footsteps tapping]

262
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,585
So now we're supposed

263
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:34,254
to play from the point
of view of an old man.

264
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,456
Sometimes I wonder if
we're in a music school

265
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,326
or is this a real acting school.

266
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,361
[dramatic piano music]

267
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,329
Charlotte.

268
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:50,103
And you're the Josh
I've been hearing about.

269
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,507
Don't worry, it's okay.

270
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,510
Uh, I don't know who
you've been talking to.

271
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:58,646
Well Zabov is crazy
about you, that's obvious.

272
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,782
[dramatic piano music]

273
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,684
You look like you could use a
break.

274
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,752
Wanna hang out, get out for a
while?

275
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:06,386
Did you hear him?

276
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,791
I can't go anywhere, shouldn't
you be practicing too?

277
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:11,224
Even if you're not in the
competition,

278
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,528
like Zabov expects it.

279
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,698
Consider that a tip from one
of his most abused students.

280
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,766
So you practice because he
tells you?

281
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,668
I practice because I
wanna win the competition.

282
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,570
I wanna have a career.

283
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:29,911
So are you coming with me?
[dramatic piano music]

284
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,346
You know, I could help you.

285
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:35,783
- Help me?
- Yes.

286
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:38,285
[Josh scoffs]

287
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,388
[bright piano music]

288
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:06,514
Tell you what, why not play
hooky for this afternoon?

289
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,617
Or are you afraid Zabov will
catch you?

290
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:10,585
[Josh scoffs]

291
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:11,886
You know how crazy things get
around here

292
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,320
before a competition.

293
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,622
That's called practicing.

294
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,791
You see a guy standing on his
head

295
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:19,226
while he practices, you know
you've been here for too long.

296
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,293
What guy?

297
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,763
You know when you see him,

298
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:26,567
and when you do, you know
it's time to get out of here.

299
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:27,702
[Josh sighs]

300
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,404
[dramatic piano music]

301
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:34,307
Well, if you change your
mind, I'll be around.

302
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,748
You know, you're not going
to find what it means

303
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,416
- in the practice room.
- And what exactly...

304
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:43,751
[door closes]

305
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,821
[footsteps tapping]

306
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,590
It's way too tethered,
do you understand?

307
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:50,858
[students chattering]

308
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,492
Ah, Joshua Irving.

309
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,696
A word, please.

310
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,866
What happened in class today?

311
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,502
You seemed distracted.

312
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,270
Nerves, I guess.

313
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,941
If you win this competition,
you'll be in demand.

314
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:11,946
They won't all be big concerts,
but concerts, nonetheless,

315
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,549
college towns, small cities.

316
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:16,450
[phone ringing]

317
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,485
Did you know that there are
people

318
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,923
who don't want to see you
in this competition, Joshua?

319
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:24,391
You have to want it.

320
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:28,261
I gave up everything
important for my career.

321
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,363
Are you ready to do that?

322
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,704
And you've got to work twice
as hard because of who you are.

323
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:37,939
Here you go.

324
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:40,975
Two totally different
interpretations of your Beethoven.

325
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,511
Listen, get some ideas.

326
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,713
Hey oh, I'm sorry.

327
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:46,914
I didn't know you had a student
in here.

328
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:47,749
I'll come back.

329
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:49,917
No, no, we're winding up right
now.

330
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:51,018
This is Josh.

331
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,755
He's in the finals tomorrow.

332
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,857
That's quite an honor,
what piece have you chosen?

333
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,325
- Uh, "Pathetique."
- Really?

334
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,728
Well that's quite an intense
piece for a man so young.

335
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:04,699
He handles it like a
man beyond his years.

336
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:05,767
You'll never get another
chance

337
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,702
like the one you have tomorrow.

338
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,737
Victor, will I see you tonight?

339
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,606
Ah, crowds aren't my thing.

340
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,441
[woman chuckles]

341
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:21,481
Uh, thanks for these.

342
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:24,051
Josh, you may think I'm harsh,

343
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:29,557
but out there are people
who will judge you harshly

344
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,426
based on everything from your
technique to your skin color.

345
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,696
You've got to be flawless.

346
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,964
You've got to play so

347
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:40,835
that they have no excuse not to
hire you.

348
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,469
Do you understand?

349
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,406
All right.

350
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,918
[soft violin music]

351
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:59,887
[woman vocalizing]

352
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,726
[Josh sighs]

353
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:09,396
- [woman shrieks]
- Dude, get out!

354
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,398
[door closes]

355
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,502

[bright piano music]

358
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,769
[Josh sighs]

359
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,606
[soft piano music]

360
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,374
[drums banging]

361
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:24,505
[drums continue banging]

362
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,844
Hey, Mom, Um, I know you're at
work.

363
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:33,714
I'm just here practicing,
probably for a few more hours

364
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,016
and then I'm gonna head home
early.

365
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,785
So call me if you need anything.

366
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,728
[traffic whirring]

367
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:05,112
[Josh sighs]

368
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:09,183
[soft piano music]

369
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,196
[phone buzzing]

370
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,779
[Father] Hey, your
mom gave me your number.

371
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:42,149
Uh, said I should call.
[dramatic piano music]

372
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:45,619
You know how convincing she can
be.

373
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:50,057
Anyway I'm really hoping you'll
come to the opening tonight.

374
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:52,226
It would mean a lot to me.

375
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,697
I just wanna share this with
you.

376
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:00,601
[pounds keys]

377
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,570
[birds chirping]

378
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:05,740
[students chattering]

379
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,647
Saw him?

380
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,819
Yeah, it's something like
that.

381
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,721
I just needed a break.

382
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:25,626
What's with the balloons?

383
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,595
They're for my niece.

384
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,131
You know, when I asked you to
hang out

385
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:34,702
for a while, I mean, it was
longer than just a break.

386
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,038
I have to be somewhere now.

387
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:40,608
And we're gonna be there a
while.

388
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:41,308
Why me?

389
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,577
Why not?

390
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:49,316
Coming or not?

391
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,126
You got a car?

392
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,229
[bright piano music]

393
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:07,134
[bike rattling]

394
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,695
[children playing]
Happy birthday, Amy.

395
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:36,997
Kazoos, thanks, Aunt Char.

396
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:41,268
Who are you, are you my aunt's
boyfriend?

397
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,804
Daddy, who's that man?

398
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:46,874
Well, I hope for his sake,
the balloon delivery man.

399
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:49,410
- Daddy, you silly.
- [laughs] Yeah.

400
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,778
Cute, yours?

401
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:54,882
So how did my sister rope you
into this?

402
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,817
I volunteered.

403
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,018
Huh, that's what he thinks.

404
00:26:58,052 --> 00:27:00,121
Uh, take this. [chuckles]

405
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:02,022
Um, I'm sorry I don't have a
present.

406
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,257
Oh no worries.

407
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,825
All the presents are donations

408
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,827
for the local animal shelter,
anyway.

409
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:09,763
- Amy insisted.
- She's a weird child.

410
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,265
Laney.

411
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,766

412
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,402

[children chattering]

[upbeat kazoo music]

415
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,277
All right, well, I guess
we'll cover this later.

416
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,712
- Okay.
- Sorry.

417
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:30,417
- What is she up to?
- Oh, give 'em a break.

418
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,386
- They're a cute couple.
- It's not so fun

419
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,388
when it's your party, is it?

420
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:37,258
Ah, could you go get the cake,
please.

421
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:42,296
[upbeat kazoo music]
[children playing]

422
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:48,836
Uh, go sit over there, come on.
[chuckles]

423
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:55,142
I'm Bryn, by the way.

424
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,044
Oh, sorry, Josh.

425
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:59,413
And you've met Laney,
our neighbor's daughter.

426
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:01,982
But she's here so much, she's
like family.

427
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:04,351
And inside's my husband Milo.

428
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,988
So how long have you known my
sister?

429
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:09,290
Oh, we just...

430
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,425
Not long. [chuckles]

431
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:12,661
And do you play piano?

432
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:17,198
Yeah, actually, apparently
we're at the same conservatory.

433
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:19,033
"Apparently."

434
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:22,369
We have a family full of
musicians.

435
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:25,039
Um, Amy is just starting to take
lessons,

436
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:26,807
and Milo plays cello.
[upbeat kazoo music]

437
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,109
Though, not so much anymore.

438
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:32,479
Um, are you competing
tomorrow in the London com...

439
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:34,915
[upbeat kazoo music]

440
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,484
You like our song, Amy and
I are gonna start a band.

441
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,320
- Oh.
- The Kazoo Keepers.

442
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:40,321
You get it, you get it?

443
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:43,824
[laughs] It's very cute.

444
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:46,260
So is Josh coming tonight?

445
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:48,395
Is that within our schedule?

446
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,164
Well, I have to go practice,
actually.

447
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:51,533
So I don't think that's gonna
happen.

448
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:55,302
Oh, you could take a
page out of his book, huh?

449
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:56,870
See, Charlotte's so naturally
gifted,

450
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:57,871
she takes things like
practicing.

451
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,240
- We have to go.
- For granted.

452
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:00,374
Look at that.

453
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,343
- Here you go.
- Oh.

454
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:04,144
But we haven't had cake yet.

455
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:07,181
[bright jazz music]

456
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:09,783
Poor kid.
[Bryn sighs]

457
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:12,753
[children playing]

458
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:14,855
Cake!

459
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,024
[children cheering]

460
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:19,059
So where can I drop you?

461
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:20,194
We had an understanding.

462
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,996
You said you wouldn't weird out
on me.

463
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,464
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

464
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:26,300
You say like I said something
I didn't.

465
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:30,170
Well, we're here now
and it's still early

466
00:29:30,204 --> 00:29:31,338
and I know you want to be alone

467
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,307
and this competition is a big
deal

468
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,142
to you, but I'm gonna be
late if I don't go now

469
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:36,578
and it's on the way back

470
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:39,113
to school and I promise
we're gonna go right back

471
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:42,349
to school and I'll be out of
your hair.

472
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:46,020
It's on the way?

473
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:51,892
Okay.

474
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,261
[door opens]

475
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:02,903
[muffled jazz music]

476
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:16,950
[students cheering]

477
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:20,321
- This my friend Josh.
- Woo!

478
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,357
[indistinct chattering]

479
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,326
Right, rock stars, button it
up.

480
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,327
Wanna show Josh what we worked
on?

481
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,494
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

482
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:31,231
One, two.

483
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,103
[smooth jazz music]

484
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,398
[hard rock music]

485
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:39,967
- [students cheering]
- Woo, yeah!

486
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,034
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

487
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:45,272
[students laughing and
chattering]

488
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:50,712
You composed that?

489
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,312
I mean, then they busted
out with that rock riff.

490
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:54,214
I don't even understand
where that comes from.

491
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:57,151
Like how, what made
you put that with jazz?

492
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,620
I put things I like.

493
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:01,989
Um, like what kind of
music do you listen to?

494
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:05,058
- What do you mean?
- What's on your playlist?

495
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,128
I don't know, Beethoven, Bach,
Mozart.

496
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:09,531
[Charlotte mimics snoring]

497
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:13,100
[chuckles] What, what's on
yours?

498
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:16,370
Led Zeppelin, John
Coltrane, Taylor Swift.

499
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:17,605
Taylor Swift?

500
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:20,240
You can't live in the
world doing the same thing

501
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:23,076
over and over and expect to be
inspired.

502
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,314
Besides, Taytay knows how
to get the party started.

503
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,518
So why classical?

504
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:34,087
What do you mean?

505
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,191
Why are you studying classical
music, why did you pick it?

506
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:38,959
I don't know, I...

507
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,597
It picked me, I guess.

508
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,635
I mean, I was around age six
when I started taking lessons.

509
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,404
And it came easy in a way.

510
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:53,675
You know, my anger just seemed
to flow right into the music.

511
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,176
Why were you angry at six?

512
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:01,381
Um, so what's the deal with
you and those kids anyway?

513
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:02,684
Like, are you like a teacher?

514
00:33:02,717 --> 00:33:04,552
I volunteer there once a week.

515
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,754
Music helped me when I was a
kid.

516
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:11,258
Figure it was something small
I could do to bring back.

517
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,694
Besides, it's fun.

518
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:14,762
[Josh chuckles]

519
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:18,633
Speaking of ways to have fun,
how's working with Zabov?

520
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,435
Huh!
[Charlotte chuckles]

521
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,270
How long have you been with
him?

522
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:25,339
- Four years.
- Oh my God.

523
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:26,340
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

524
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,208
Wanna hear something funny?

525
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,209
Okay.

526
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:32,346
My grandma and Zabov
used to have a thing.

527
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:33,715
A thing?

528
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:36,116
And it was serious,
apparently.

529
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,585
She talks about him all the
time,

530
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,821
but she would never admit that.

531
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:41,723
I think it's hilarious.
[siren wailing]

532
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:46,059
It's basically the reason why
I avoided studying with him.

533
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,596
So how's that going anyway?

534
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,431
What, your grandma and Zabov?

535
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:52,734
You and Zabov.

536
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:56,538
[chuckles] He's tough.

537
00:33:56,571 --> 00:33:58,105
I need that.

538
00:33:58,138 --> 00:33:59,206
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

539
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,709
You know, like discipline.

What?

542
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,716
We've been in the same school,
both

543
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,853
about to graduate, and yet
I have never ever seen you.

544
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:13,855
You've never been to a single
party,

545
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,824
to a single school competition
or show.

546
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:19,794
I mean, I bet you spent all of
your time in a practice room.

547
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:21,529
This little 10 by 10 practice
room,

548
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,330
doing nothing but practicing all
day

549
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,165
and eating food delivered to
you.

550
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:26,500
I mean, I'm sorry, but that's
just

551
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:27,735
some unpleasant problem with
discipline.

552
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,872
You have me all figured out,
huh?

553
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:32,840
Well, you missed the part

554
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,877
where I haven't been here all
four years.

555
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,714
Zabov pulled strings
and got me in this year.

556
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,786
Apparently, he felt community
college was beneath me.

557
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:45,887
Yeah.

558
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,725
Tell you what, the $30
classes weren't beneath me.

559
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,326
Look, it's your first year

560
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:54,896
at conservatory and you made the
finals.

561
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,164
- You're gonna win.
- Huh.

562
00:34:57,197 --> 00:35:00,668
Well, I guess if having
no life is winning.

563
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:05,840
So I was right, all of
your time in a practice.

564
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:11,646
I have to win.

565
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:14,281

a birthday party tonight.

575

00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:50,845
How do you know him?

709
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:51,979
Seriously, I would give anything

710
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,948
just to be a fly on his wall.

711
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:56,617
Well, he is right there,
you can break in anytime.

712
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,587
[chuckles] No, seriously, how,
how?

713
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,188
- Grandma.
- She knows him?

714
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:02,957
She's been there?

715
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,993
They used to play
together a long time ago.

716
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:07,661
And she's the one having the
birthday?

717
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,063
Yes, every year.

718
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:10,631
It's a tradition.

719
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:14,969
So are you coming?

720
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:17,838

[Josh sighing]

722
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:25,012
Yes, yes.

723
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:30,751
Ooh, just one more
stop on the way, okay?

724
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:33,154
[knocking]

725
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:34,722
Hey, Charlotte.

726
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:38,259
Late as always, glad you could
make it.

727
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,027
Hi, come on in.

[bright classical music]
[guests chattering]

729
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:43,597
Welcome to the Kraken Factory.

730
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:45,866
We do this thing where we,
playing and stuff for each other.

731
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,069
Kind of like the guys over
Ireland has.

732
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:50,237
Except these are the class
clowns.

733
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:53,274
Shut up, I prefer to think
of ourselves as open-minded.

734
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:57,978
Welcome to our somewhat
famous alt classical enclave.

735
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:02,783
What are you doing?

736
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:04,819
And what are you talking
about?

737
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:05,853
Who is he?

738
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:08,656
- Just a friend.
- Holy crap.

739
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:09,957
- He's the guy.
- No.

740
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,392
The guy from the competition
tomorrow.

741
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,194
The guy that you've been
stalking.

742
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:14,328
No, I wasn't stalking him.

743
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:17,665
Are you purposely trying
to sabotage the poor kid?

744
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:19,366
I was just curious, don't be
weird.

745
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,970
Hey, hey, what's been going on
with you?

746
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,176
I kinda don't wanna do the
competition.

747
00:43:30,377 --> 00:43:33,247
And I haven't rehearsed like at
all.

748
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,882
Charlotte, you could
win that competition

749
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:37,017
with your eyes closed and
your fingers chopped off.

750
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,886
This time, it's different.

751
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:41,322
He's really good, like really
good.

752
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:43,190
Why do you care about
the competition at all?

753
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:45,326
You can just quit.

754
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,227
Grandma.

755
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:50,364
I'm sorry, sweetie, you are so
screwed.

756
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:54,235
[guests chattering]

757
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:55,669
- All right, everyone.
- Woo!

758
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:56,670
- Yeah!
- Woo!

759
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:58,739
Let's get this thing rolling.

- Woo, all right!
- Woo!

[musicians laughing]

766
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,881

[musicians cheering and
laughing]

768
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,420
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

769
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:57,291
Goodnight.

770
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,460
See you next week.

00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:16,578
You ready?

775
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:18,279
This is so weird.

776
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:20,114
Why?

777
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:23,050
I don't know, it just is.

778
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,919
[soft keyboard music]

779
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:29,456
You just haven't gotten to
know it yet.

780
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,357
Come.

781
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:33,327
Hmm, come.

[woman clears throat]

784
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:16,270
Are you forgetting something?

785
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:17,605
Crap, grandma!

786

[audience chattering]

788
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,648
- Hello, beautiful lady.
- Oh, Margerie, dear.

789
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:28,650
- How are you?
- Wonderful.

790
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:30,417
Happy birthday.
[Corinna chuckles]

791
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:33,287
Will you be singing for us
tonight?

792
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,955
Excuse me, dear.

793
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,056
Where's Charlotte?

794
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,525
Oh, you know, she's always
late.

795
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,026
Your husband should be here.

796
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,027
Well, he had to wait for the
sitter.

797
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,994
He'll be here soon.

798
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:43,230
[chuckles] I don't
need all of this anyway.

799
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:46,233
Oh, it's your birthday,
we have to celebrate you.

800
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:48,168
Besides, it's some
unwritten law that we have

801
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:50,971
to annoy our family members
with cake and presents.

802
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:52,139
[Man] Corinna, Corinna!

803
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:54,308
- Oh!
- How are you, my sweet?

804
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:57,010
It is so good to see you, happy
birthday.

805
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:00,582
I cannot wait to hear you
dazzle us on the keys tonight.

806
00:48:00,615 --> 00:48:02,416
- Uh.
- Bryn, tell her

807
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:07,388
this is her night and she
can have whatever she wants.

808
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:10,124
[Corinna chuckles]
Is everything okay over here?

809
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:11,992
- What he says?
- You get whatever you want.

810
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,327
[both laugh]

811
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,928
Isn't this nice?

812
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:17,131
Beautiful night, great friends.

813
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:19,900
Great music and no more protest.

Oh, she's so old.

817
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,543
- Grandma.
- That is so delicious.

818
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:03,177
I dare you to throw it out.

819
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,546
Someone I want you to meet.

820
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:05,446
Oh!

821
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,482
This is my friend Josh.

822
00:49:08,516 --> 00:49:10,618
Oh, yes, Josh the pianist.

823
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:12,687
Uh, happy to meet you, ma'am.

824
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,523
Please, ma'am is not
necessary.

825
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:20,294
So you are a Victor Zabov's new
student.

826
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:23,096
The next one in line for
all the accolades, yes?

827
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,264
[Josh chuckles]

828
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:26,233
I'm surprised he let you out
tonight.

829
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:30,237
He usually keeps very close
guard on all his musicians.

830
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:33,741
Hothouse musicians, we used to
call them.

831
00:49:33,775 --> 00:49:37,044
So this is Charlie's idea, I
presume.

832
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:40,080
Gotta hand it to the girl.

833
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:41,482
She's a wily one.

00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:44,586
[upbeat piano music]

835
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:54,796
It's my birthday.

836
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,799
And I want to hear my
granddaughter play.

837
00:49:57,832 --> 00:50:00,200
Hmm, I'm not getting up there.

838
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:01,101
Why not?

839
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,438
Okay, I'll tell you what

840
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:07,274
if that bartender does a
cartwheel before she gets back

841
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:10,578
to the bar, you'll get up on
that stage.

842
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,247
Wait for it, wait for it.

843
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,682
It's gonna happen.

844
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:19,086
It did not happen, okay.

845
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,823
[Corinna laughs]

846
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:23,223
I'll tell you what.

847
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:24,692
Go up there, I go up there.

848
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:26,393
Oh, please.

849
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:31,131
The silly arguing, both of
you, you're musicians, yes?

850
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:33,267
Get up on that stage and play.

[bright piano music]

852
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:39,406
You know what?

00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:43,745
Push.

854
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:45,513
Yeah.

00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:51,786
- [audience applauding]
- Bravo, oh, bravo.

00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,527
Come on Mr. Beethoven.

[Charlotte] Yes!

863
00:53:18,132 --> 00:53:21,268
- Did that just happen?
- Yes, it did.

864
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:24,839
That was unreal. [laughs]

865
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:26,941
Not too shabby, Mr. Beethoven.

866
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:29,376
That's my roommate's
girlfriend calls me.

867
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,612
She said it's 'cause I'm
a slob like Beethoven.

868
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:34,347
Oh, really?
[Josh laughs]

869
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:37,852
You look like a young Denzel
Washington when you laugh.

Rock!

Plymouth Rock landed on us!"

[chuckles] It's Denzel.

873
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,926
As it's Malcolm X.

874
00:53:46,694 --> 00:53:50,330
- Is that a movie?
- Oh, Charlotte.

875
00:53:50,363 --> 00:53:51,298
No, no, no.

876
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:56,470
I've seen every Denzel
movie at least six times.

877
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,438
And not just because he's hot.

I, I'm sorry.

881

- Did I...
- No.

882
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:18,893
- Should I not have?
- No.

883
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,863
[chuckles] I'm not good at
this.

884
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:25,066
It's me, I shouldn't
have kept you out so long.

885
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:29,670
You have an important day
tomorrow and you should go.

886
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:32,305
Yeah, actually, yeah.

887
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:33,541
- Yeah.
- Okay, uh.

888
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,909
- Yes.
- Um, okay.

889
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,979
I'll just go grab a water.

890
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:40,815
- Sure, yes.
- For the long bus ride home.

891
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:45,853
[soft piano music]
[crickets chirping]

892
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:54,095
Really been a rough night in
there.

893
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:56,831
- Thank you.
- You know, heroes.

894
00:54:56,864 --> 00:54:59,600
Mm. [exhales]

895
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:04,605
Are you out here fake smoking
again?

896
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:05,873
[Milo exhales]

897
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:08,810
[group chattering]

898
00:55:08,843 --> 00:55:11,344
[Bryn laughs]

899
00:55:11,378 --> 00:55:12,713
Some show, huh?

900
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,484
Well maybe we should go
easier on her, she is only 20.

901
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:19,620
Old enough to know what she's
doing.

902
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:20,555
You see it, right?

903
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:21,656
She's doing the same thing to
that kid.

904
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:24,692
You know what, maybe this
time it'll be different.

905
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:26,594
People don't change.

906
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:31,498
Are you forgetting that
maybe if things hadn't happened

907
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:34,467
that way we wouldn't have
happened?

908
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:39,574
Another drink, we got a
sitter.

909
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:41,776
Certainly that's cause for
celebration.

910
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:43,578
[both laughing]

911
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:46,781
[upbeat jazz music]

912
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:48,149
Ah, two waters please.

913
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:49,951
- You bet.
- Thank you.

914
00:55:49,984 --> 00:55:52,086
There he is, man of the hour.

915
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,486
[Josh chuckles]

916
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,622
That's nice playing.

917
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:55,957
Thank you, thanks.

918
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,826
Did you ever do the
Beethoven cello sonatas?

919
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,695
No, but I'd love to.

920
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:02,163
- Mm.
- Anything else, gentlemen?

921
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:03,831
- No, we're okay.
- What are we drinking?

922
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:06,000
[glasses clink]
Yours truly did

923
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:08,569
many years ago at the
conservatory.

924
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:11,038
My accompanist was just a kid.

925
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:12,405
What was that like?

926
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:13,674
Humiliating!

927
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,843
[both chuckle]

928
00:56:15,877 --> 00:56:17,945
Aren't you gonna ask me why?

929
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:19,046
- Uh.
- We just started the first

930
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,948
movement and she took off like a
bat out

931
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:23,017
of hell, Just ramrodded
through the whole thing.

932
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,619
Just pure ego.

933
00:56:24,652 --> 00:56:26,587
She was a real piece of work,
that one.

934
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:28,589
I got slammed by the papers, but
the kid,

935
00:56:28,623 --> 00:56:30,892
she gets rave reviews, they
loved her.

936
00:56:30,925 --> 00:56:33,895
They just can't wait to
see your next appearance.

937
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:35,529
She was just a kid, right?

938
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,865
I'm sure she didn't mean
to, you know, sabotage...

939
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:39,432
Just watch yourself.

940
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:41,836
And what you see is not what you
get.

941
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:43,704
We will have no crying in our
beers

942
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,973
- at this party, thank you.
- Mm.

943
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:48,676
Oh, and they just put out
scallops wrapped in bacon.

944
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:51,579
Speaking my language.
[Josh and Bryn chuckle]

945
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:54,081
Here is to Beethoven ala bacon.

946
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:59,020
Mm, this vodka's gone bad.

947
00:56:59,053 --> 00:57:03,524
Taste like water. [laughing]

948
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:05,726
Uh, yeah, excuse him.

949
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,961
Yeah, it's okay.

950
00:57:06,994 --> 00:57:10,231
Um, nice performance earlier.

951
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:13,601
I didn't expect that, I thought
you were strictly classical.

952
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:16,570
Well, tonight's been
different.

953
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:18,773
This whole day has.

954
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:20,207
Are your parents coming?

955
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:23,144
I'd love to meet the
people who raised that one.

956
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,546
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say
something wrong?

957
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,515
No, no, it's okay.

958
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:29,951
Um, they're no longer with us.

959
00:57:30,985 --> 00:57:32,853
There was a car accident.

960
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:36,489
I don't think Charlie even
remembers them.

961
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:38,693
She never talks about them.

962
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:40,928
I'm sorry.

963
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:45,533
Now she's the only one
who ever really got Charlie.

964
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:47,702
- Your grandmother?
- Yeah.

965
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:49,870
I mean, when Mom and Dad passed,

966
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:51,539
I was already pretty much out

967
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:53,908
of the house and Charlie
was still a toddler.

968
00:57:53,941 --> 00:57:55,643
Well that explains the accent.

969
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:56,978
Oh, yeah.

970
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:59,146
Well, and Grandma raised
Charlie,

971
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,048
but I think she picked up the
accent

972
00:58:01,082 --> 00:58:03,584
on purpose to be closer to her.

973
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:05,219
She's pretty great.

974
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:08,589
On the piano.

975
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,192
On the piano, yeah.

976
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,628
Look, Josh, I know it's none

977
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:17,131
of my business, but
that London competition.

978
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:18,632
Uh, don't remind me.

979
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,267
My teacher would yank
me from the competition

980
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:22,770
- if he knew I was here.
- So you do know that...

981
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:24,572
- No, ooh, hi.
- Mm.

982
00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:25,773
- Hi.
- Hi.

983
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,808
Okay, well we'll talk later.

984
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:28,976
- Okay.
- Come, you.

985
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,711
- All right.
- Let's, let's, let's...

986
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:31,912
He's a good guy.

987
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,914
Hello everyone, hi, um...

988
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:34,882
Can I get two more
waters, please, sorry.

989
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:37,284
I would like to thank
our guest of honor.

990
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:38,953
And thank you all for coming.

Corinna.

993
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:47,294
I think as a thank you gift for
us,

994
00:58:47,328 --> 00:58:50,765
for her birthday, she should
sing us or play us something.

995
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,166
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

Thank you.

I must know a hundred melodies,

1014
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:04,064
but the last few years I've been
playing

1015
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:06,367
the same ones over and over.

1016
01:01:07,134 --> 01:01:12,239
I sit at the piano and it's
the same melodies all the time.

1017
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:13,874
I don't know if I was trying

1018
01:01:13,908 --> 01:01:17,912
to perfect them or if I'm
just a creature of habit,

1019
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:21,415
but then my hands couldn't
stretch as far.

1020
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,687
And then it became
difficult to play at all.

1021
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:31,125
And it's hard to admit
that even here on my,

1022
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:35,029
hmm, birthday.
[crowd laughs]

1023
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:39,500
When you love something
and then one day it's gone,

1024
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:44,205
you realize that maybe
it's good that you decided

1025
01:01:44,238 --> 01:01:48,976
to have a life outside the
music, but I have no regrets.

1026
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:51,979
I have lived fully.

1027
01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:55,049
And I have loved fully.

1028
01:01:56,217 --> 01:02:01,422
And now my Charlie is going
to take over in my footsteps

1029
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:04,491
and make her grandma so proud.

I thought you left
without saying goodbye.

1034
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:22,009
Why is he here?

1035
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,377
I think it's because of
grandma.

1036
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,979
No, no, you said they weren't
a thing.

1037
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:27,181
- They're not.
- Okay, I have to leave

1038
01:02:27,214 --> 01:02:29,216
before he sees me here,
but my bag is inside,

1039
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:33,220
my bike is out front,
what am I supposed...

1040
01:02:33,254 --> 01:02:34,355
There's something else.

1041

What, what else?

1042
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:37,491
Josh, I need to tell you
something.

1043
01:02:37,525 --> 01:02:40,127
What, what, Charlotte, what?

1044
01:02:41,462 --> 01:02:43,964
There you are, missy.

1045
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:48,202
I don't appreciate you
forcing me up on that stage.

1046
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:49,803
And you, where are you
off to in such a hurry?

1047
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:50,904
I have to go.

1048
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:51,772
Zabov is gonna pull me

1049
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:54,041
from the competition if he sees
me here.

1050
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:56,343
That's absolutely correct.

1051
01:02:57,878 --> 01:03:00,881
Victor Zabov, nothing has
changed.

1052
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,884
You're still an ass.

1053
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:05,819
That's crass, Corinna.

1054
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:07,988
If you don't let your
musicians live a little,

1055
01:03:08,022 --> 01:03:10,357
how are they going to bring
any life into their music?

1056
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:12,092
He's a good teacher,
Corinna, he's just trying-

1057
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:14,161
- I can handle my own battles,
Josh.

1058
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:17,599
Oh, you said something he
has always been able to handle.

1059
01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:18,600
His battles.

1060
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:21,835
Let me take you home,
I have a car waiting.

1061
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,037
Why?

1062
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,472
So you can lock me in a room
like you do your musicians?

1063
01:03:25,507 --> 01:03:27,408
Not letting them live their
lives.

1064
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:29,476
I do that for their own good.

1065
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:31,312
Joshua wouldn't have gotten this
far,

1066
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,014
if it wasn't for strict
discipline.

1067
01:03:34,048 --> 01:03:36,584
And now he's playing
for one of the greatest

1068
01:03:36,618 --> 01:03:39,386
- competitions in the-
- Oh, posh!

1069
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,455
It doesn't matter who you're
playing for

1070
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:43,023
or what you're playing.

1071
01:03:43,057 --> 01:03:46,260
A musician has to connect
with his audience.

1072
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:49,096
I don't care if you play
every single note perfectly.

1073
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:53,200
If you don't have anything
to say, don't waste my time.

1074
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:56,236
And you, what you did in there
tonight,

1075
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,006
now that was something special.

1076
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:01,442
- Oh, oh!
- Grandma!

1077
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:05,913
- [Corinna groaning]
- Corinna, are you all right?

1078
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:07,549
I told you I was gonna take you
home.

1079
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:08,916
Now I'll take you to the
hospital.

1080
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:12,086
[Corinna groaning]
Lift her up. [grunts]

1081
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:15,489
- Josh, grab my purse.
- Hold her, hold her.

1082
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:17,458
Come on, go ahead, go.

1083
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:18,425
Go, go, go.

1086
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:25,899
I don't think she missed us one
bit.

1087
01:04:25,933 --> 01:04:28,135
Gosh, seeing those kids tonight

1088
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:30,137
reminded me of how I used to be
with us.

1089
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,271
When was the last time we were
all goofy

1090
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:33,173
and playful like that?

1091
01:04:34,509 --> 01:04:35,376
Baby, hey,

1092
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:39,547
it happened, it's over.

1093
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:42,449
Besides, she's not the reason
you stopped playing, remember?

1094
01:04:42,483 --> 01:04:44,451
Come on, why did you stop
playing?

1095
01:04:44,485 --> 01:04:46,153
Because I quit auditioning.

1096
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,054
Why?

1097
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,991
'Cause that curmudgeon

arthritis.

Oh, come on, why?

1100
01:04:55,496 --> 01:04:57,364
'Cause I was losing my soul.

1101
01:04:57,398 --> 01:05:00,000
And it became about winning.

1102
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,447
Do you regret our life together?

1103
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,415
What, no.

1104
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,985
No, I love our life.

You're right.

I still think she should see a

She needs an x-ray.

have been a mini-stroke.

keeps saying this was nothing.

tomorrow

What I want to know is what's
going on between you two?

careers, your music?

- For four weeks.

- This is the first night

- I left, okay?
- And he was practicing.

1155

- I'm sorry.
- And I was helping him.

You actually had what it takes
to win.

And then you go and do
something stupid like this.

try to tell me, Charlotte?

that

I was somehow special and you
wanted to hang out with me?

perfect

were everyone's favorite.

same thing instead of...

would have changed anything?

1230
01:11:41,903 --> 01:11:43,738
not taking anything seriously,
just...

1231
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:46,007
And somehow you got into the
finals

1232
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,441
of one of the most prestigious
competitions in the worst!

1233
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:51,411
Why is everyone making
such a big deal out of it?

1234
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:53,614
Everyone's gonna know who's
Beethoven in a hundred years,

1235
01:11:53,648 --> 01:11:57,018
will they know who Josh Irving
is?

1236
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,554
Oh, shit, Josh, I didn't
mean it like that.

1237
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:00,453
Josh!

1238
01:12:01,122 --> 01:12:03,057
No, I'm sorry, I meant all of
us.

1239
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:07,360
You are not the person
I thought you were.

1240
01:12:07,394 --> 01:12:08,796
Neither are you.

1241
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:13,801
You act like everyone is
abandoning you,

1242
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:15,703
but you're the one who choose
all of this.

1243
01:12:15,736 --> 01:12:18,139
You choose to spend your
life in a practice room.

1244
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:20,541
You choose to think that
you're somehow different

1245
01:12:20,575 --> 01:12:21,843
so you couldn't have any
friends.

1246
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,410
And you choose to think

1247
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:25,813
that you have to be
perfect to have a career.

1248
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:27,715
I don't know what the
thing with your father is,

1249
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:29,884
but at least you have one.

1250
01:12:33,588 --> 01:12:36,924
- What about your bike?
- I'll take the bus!

1251
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:42,763
[traffic whirring]

1252
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:56,777
[Josh screams]
[fist pounds]

1253
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:05,119
[indistinct chattering]

1254
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:07,822
[bus rumbling]

1255
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:40,453
[Josh sighs]

1256
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:51,565
[traffic whirring]

1257
01:14:19,527 --> 01:14:22,196
I'd never seen her happier,
hmm.

1258
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:25,933
Mm, you were her whole world.

1259
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:28,803
You were the light of her life,
man.

1260
01:14:28,836 --> 01:14:32,840
After you were born, she
didn't need anything.

1261
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:34,608
Not her art, not me.

1262
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:40,982
[scoffs] You were hardly
there.

1263
01:14:41,015 --> 01:14:43,684
You don't know what she needed.

1264
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:47,487
I know, and I'm sorry.

1265
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:55,563
You know, this photograph,

1266
01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:00,968
this photograph is the thing
that got me painting again.

1267
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:03,871
Deepened my love for art.

1268
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:06,073
Your mom and I had just come
from a little flea market

1269
01:15:06,107 --> 01:15:09,110
and I bought her a used
Roller-flex.

1270
01:15:10,044 --> 01:15:12,113
And I snapped that on the fly.

1271
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:15,783
And later that night, she told
me she was pregnant with you.

1272
01:15:15,816 --> 01:15:17,284
Why are you here?

1273
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:22,823
Why are you suddenly hellbound
on staying?

1274
01:15:23,657 --> 01:15:27,061
I had an opportunity, I had to
leave.

1275
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:30,664
I'm not saying it's right,

1276
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:32,767
but it was what I felt I had to
do.

1277
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,301
[dramatic music]

1278
01:15:34,335 --> 01:15:37,238
But looking back, all the
traveling, all the places,

1279
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:39,573
all the running around, trying
to get the perfect shot,

1280
01:15:39,607 --> 01:15:40,474
the perfect sunset.

1281
01:15:40,509 --> 01:15:43,577
I would trade all that in a
heartbeat

1282
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:47,715
to get back the moments I
lost with you and your mom.

1283
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:50,751
I didn't know it then, but I do
now.

1284
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:54,255
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

1285
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:56,090
Like tonight, this competition,

1286
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:59,860
whatever happens, I'm
gonna be here for you.

1287
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:03,330
If moving mom away, is what you

1288
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,904
and she wants, then
I'll go wherever you go,

1289
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:16,744
'cause it's not about where I am
anymore,

1290
01:16:18,145 --> 01:16:19,980
about where you are.

1291
01:16:20,014 --> 01:16:22,750
And I'm gonna prove that to you.

1292
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,357
If you knew how hard
mom worked all these years

1293
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,362
while you were out living it up.

1294
01:16:35,396 --> 01:16:37,898
All pompous with your travel log
photos

1295
01:16:37,932 --> 01:16:40,334
and drinking wine with
these pretentious idiots

1296
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:43,904
who think you're some kind of
genius!

1297
01:16:43,938 --> 01:16:47,007
And then you come here and
pretend

1298
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:51,745
to be interested in what I'm
doing every couple of years.

1299
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:54,315
You have no idea what it's like.

1300
01:16:55,816 --> 01:16:57,651
You don't care about me

1301
01:16:57,685 --> 01:17:01,255
or my music or about my goals
to move mom away from here.

1302
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:02,957
It's all about you!

1303
01:17:06,894 --> 01:17:08,062
Still.

1304
01:17:08,095 --> 01:17:11,765
[dramatic music continues]

1305
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:18,939
[door opens]

1306
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:22,309
Hey grandma, shouldn't
you be at the doctors?

1307
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:24,145
I'm back, I'm fine.

1308
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,014
I told you.

1309
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:30,184
Where is Zabov?

1310
01:17:30,217 --> 01:17:33,420
[scoffs] He went to buy
some groceries to make lunch.

1311
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:35,122
Stubborn old fool.

1312
01:17:35,156 --> 01:17:37,925
[dramatic music]

1313
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:40,427
What you did last night-

1314
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:42,263
- I know, I'm sorry.

1315
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:45,733
[speaking in foreign language]

1316
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:47,835
What you did was wrong.

1317
01:17:48,903 --> 01:17:51,338
You're better than that.

1318
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:53,240
But I take some fault.

1319
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:56,944
I pressed you too hard to win.

1320
01:17:56,977 --> 01:17:58,445
No, Grandma, it's not...

1321
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:01,815
I forgot what it's like to be
young.

1322
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:06,820
Have a life of opportunity
in front of you.

1323
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:08,155
In love.

1324
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:09,990
I'm not in love.

1325
01:18:10,024 --> 01:18:11,058
You are so head over heels,

1326
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:14,728
you can't walk unless
you're doing a handstand.

1327
01:18:14,762 --> 01:18:16,764
I was so worried about your
future.

1328
01:18:16,797 --> 01:18:19,466
I could only see that
competition.

1329
01:18:20,569 --> 01:18:25,839
It was the love of the music,
not the fame, not the money.

1330
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:28,876
It was always the music.

1331
01:18:29,944 --> 01:18:34,148
When I watched you and
Josh up there last night,

1332
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:40,020
a new fire got lit in this
old dusty heart of mine.

1333
01:18:41,488 --> 01:18:44,091
Oh, I haven't felt that since-

1334
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:46,327
- Grandpa?

1335
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,428
No, before.

1336
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:52,099
Do ever regret not taking a
chance?

1337
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,736
[door opens]

1338
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:03,010
I'll meet you in the kitchen.

1339
01:19:10,351 --> 01:19:15,022
Sometimes, but then I wouldn't
have you or your sister.

1340
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:19,960
[Charlotte chuckles]

1341
01:19:23,831 --> 01:19:27,001
You have to figure out
what it is you want,

1342
01:19:27,034 --> 01:19:29,336
not what the rest of us want.

1343
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:32,574
Everyone is just trying to
figure out their own shit.

1344
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,474
Grandma!

1345
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:38,412
Yes, your grandma
curses on occasion too.

1346
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:40,515
Practice, don't practice.

1347
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:44,151
I'm going to get myself some
lunch.

1348
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:46,854
[bright music]

1349
01:20:00,301 --> 01:20:02,036
I would've stayed.

1350
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:04,238
I know.

1351
01:20:05,906 --> 01:20:07,308
That's why I left.

1352
01:20:10,612 --> 01:20:13,548
[Corinna chuckles]

1353
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,217
Hey, package for Josh Irving.

1354
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:19,486
- Yeah, that's me.
- All right.

1355
01:20:19,521 --> 01:20:21,455
Just sign here, please.

1356
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:26,427
- You have a good day.
- Thanks, you too.

1357
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,328
Okay.

1358
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:51,919
[paper tearing]

1359
01:20:53,287 --> 01:20:56,490
[dramatic piano music]

1360
01:21:25,452 --> 01:21:28,656
[dramatic piano music]

1361
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:14,334
[indistinct chattering]

1362
01:22:23,678 --> 01:22:26,548
You, I saw you at the piano
bar.

1363
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:30,017
That was magnificent, young man.

1364
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,218
The caliber of your talent is
gonna

1365
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:33,454
put you on the world stage.

1366
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:37,090
I look forward to what your
future holds.

1367
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:40,394
And look at that face, the full
package.

1368
01:22:40,427 --> 01:22:41,295
Fabulous.

1369
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:44,566
You're ready.

1370
01:22:44,599 --> 01:22:46,133
You're ready.

1371
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:47,167
Confidence.

1372
01:22:48,603 --> 01:22:51,071
Saturday is gone, take a deep
breath.

1373
01:22:51,104 --> 01:22:52,674
[both inhaling]

1374
01:22:52,707 --> 01:22:54,408
Deep breaths.

1375
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:58,045
Now, once you perform, you
come backstage and wait.

1376
01:22:58,078 --> 01:23:00,013
The results will be announced
immediately

1377
01:23:00,047 --> 01:23:02,015
following the competition.

1378
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:03,984
So Beatrice, you're up.

1379
01:23:08,255 --> 01:23:10,457
- Good luck. [sighs]
- Thanks.

1380
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:12,059
You too.
[Beatrice sighs]

1381
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:15,095
[footsteps tapping]

1382
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,803
[bright piano music]

1383
01:23:21,836 --> 01:23:26,373
I'm glad to see you've
come to your senses.

1384
01:23:26,406 --> 01:23:29,544
Potassium for the nerves,
smart boy.

1385
01:23:31,813 --> 01:23:33,781
- Victor.
- Corinna.

1386
01:23:33,815 --> 01:23:34,682
Hmm.

1387
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,621
I just wanted to tell
you good luck tonight.

1388
01:23:39,654 --> 01:23:41,823
You are a stellar pianist.

1389
01:23:41,856 --> 01:23:45,325
And just remember, play from
your heart.

1390
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:47,194
Hmm?

1391
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:51,633
- May I help you off?
- Certainly.

1392
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:54,736
[bright piano music]

1393
01:24:04,177 --> 01:24:06,179
Why do you play, Josh?

1394
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:08,616
I, because...

1395
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:11,285
'Cause why?

1396
01:24:12,185 --> 01:24:14,187
Do you love it?

1397
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:17,224
I've taught you everything I
can.

1398
01:24:17,257 --> 01:24:20,193
Now it's up to you to
do what's in your heart.

1399
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:22,129
Trust your instincts.

1400
01:24:22,162 --> 01:24:24,264
Don't let any moment get away.

1401
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:28,235
[bright piano music continues]

[dramatic piano music]

1407
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:56,751
Now that we got that over
with.

1408
01:27:00,588 --> 01:27:01,989
Once upon a time,

1409
01:27:03,991 --> 01:27:07,829
a young Beethoven got
to play for his idol,

1410
01:27:07,862 --> 01:27:09,564
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

1411
01:27:09,597 --> 01:27:13,634
in the hope that he would
get to study under him.

1412
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:18,940
Uh, the story goes that
Mozart had no interest

1413
01:27:19,741 --> 01:27:22,677
in being interrupted by
something

1414
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:25,445
so frivolous and was even colder

1415
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:30,852
when Beethoven played a
studied piece of Mozart's.

1416
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,624
Beethoven begged for another
chance.

1417
01:27:36,657 --> 01:27:40,427
Mozart played a tune
that the young composer

1418
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,530
could never have possibly heard.

1419
01:27:42,563 --> 01:27:46,500
Beethoven then went on to
improvise on that tune.

1420
01:27:46,534 --> 01:27:49,737
Rumor has it that after
Beethoven played,

1421
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:52,774
Mozart said, "Look out for that
boy.

1422
01:27:53,808 --> 01:27:56,811
One day he'll give the world
something to talk about."

1423
01:27:56,844 --> 01:27:59,847
Beethoven never went on
to study under Mozart,

1424
01:27:59,881 --> 01:28:04,752
but he became beloved all on
his own, doing his own thing.

1425
01:28:08,723 --> 01:28:10,858
Now, if you'll indulge me,

1426
01:28:14,361 --> 01:28:16,597
I'd like to try my own thing,

1427
01:28:16,631 --> 01:28:18,699
inspired by Beethoven and

1428
01:28:22,737 --> 01:28:24,337
a few new friends.

1429
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:29,811
For you tonight.

[bright piano music continues]

1436
01:30:37,071 --> 01:30:40,473
Sorry, Grandma, my heart's not
in it.

1437
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:45,179
But everything will be fine,
promise.

1438
01:30:46,881 --> 01:30:47,815
Love you.

- You quit.

And you are still here,

Hey.

We're gonna go home and
get our stuff and shower.

Back to rehearse, you
know, in like an hour?

Yeah, yeah, that's perfect.

1476
01:34:21,695 --> 01:34:24,865
I'll be done with the choir by
then.

1477

How did you know where to find
me?

The other kids are great
at music, awful with secrets.

1479

It's wonderful what you do
for those kids in the church.

1480
01:34:44,919 --> 01:34:46,120
I don't get it.

1481

You got everything you want,
why are you still here?

1482

you quit.

Well, at least you have
it, that's something.

I...

Ooh, the great Charlotte lost
for words,

1488
01:35:19,486 --> 01:35:24,258
Hmm, I guess there's a first
time for everything, huh?

1489
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:30,431
When I was watching you
play, you really loved it.

1490
01:35:32,866 --> 01:35:34,735
But I don't feel that.

1491
01:35:36,503 --> 01:35:39,440
I feel like when I'm
playing with all the kids.

1492
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:44,278
I feel like when I'm playing
with a gig on the toy piano.

1493
01:35:46,847 --> 01:35:48,782
And I feel it with you.

1494
01:35:51,085 --> 01:35:54,188
The performance, the
competition, you were amazing.

1495
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:57,791
And my grandma couldn't
stop talking about you.

1496
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:01,395
She told me that the judges
were arguing for hours.

1497
01:36:01,428 --> 01:36:02,363
Is it true?

1498
01:36:04,965 --> 01:36:07,401
Okay, yes, all right, uh...

1499
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:09,503
I just wanted to say that I'm

1500
01:36:09,537 --> 01:36:12,473
I'm sorry for messing up your
life,

1501
01:36:13,508 --> 01:36:15,109
for ruining it and

1502
01:36:17,978 --> 01:36:19,179
I'm just sorry.

quit the competition.

01:36:33,561 --> 01:36:35,963
I cared why you quit on me.

1506
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:44,004
You left after all of that.

1507
01:36:44,038 --> 01:36:47,341
And you say you feel all of
that, but you

1508
01:36:49,143 --> 01:36:50,411
you walked away.

1509
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:58,052
I know I messed up, but I
can't take it back. [sniffs]

1510
01:36:59,086 --> 01:37:00,220
I was alone.

1511
01:37:02,323 --> 01:37:03,190
Again.

1512
01:37:12,099 --> 01:37:16,270
I didn't stay for you,
because of you or whatever.

1513
01:37:16,303 --> 01:37:17,171
I know.

1514
01:37:19,006 --> 01:37:20,374
I stayed for me.

1515
01:37:21,643 --> 01:37:23,911
This is where I wanna be.

1516
01:37:30,451 --> 01:37:32,920
I would just prefer you here

1517
01:37:36,423 --> 01:37:37,291
