I love the settlements,

179
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:02,354
balances

180
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:04,998
exchange station
burning ...

181
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:07,497
And stalls offer!

182
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:09,654
Welcome to the world of Fausta!

183
00:43:09,776 --> 00:43:11,824
You came for something else.

184
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:13,423
Shall I take this?

185
00:43:13,614 --> 00:43:15,088
To turn up?

186
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:17,573
Few seconds.

187
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,903
Go back to your world red
of envy and glory!

188
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:25,289
--I lose memory?
--Be young and wise!

189
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:27,254
How many guests?

190
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:28,796
--Hello!
--How are you?

191
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:31,664
I invited Abelardo Vaca.
No, have to pay.

192
00:43:31,762 --> 00:43:33,987
No. .. you Have to pay.
It's 10 pesos.

193
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,751
--It is a work of art!
--I came because I was invited!

194
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:38,799
--Get in!
--Thanks.

195
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,534
What I want is clear ...

196
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:45,880
His soul!

197
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,940
Not a bad deal ...

198
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,316
I want all of yours!

199
00:43:50,521 --> 00:43:52,405
Hallelujah!

200
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:53,934
What has life to life!

201
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:57,729
The future welcomes you!

202
00:43:58,755 --> 00:43:59,929
It's my aunt.

203
00:44:01,492 --> 00:44:03,779
The future welcomes you!

204
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,291
To be young is to be naked.

205
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:11,994
Youth is naked!

206
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:23,763
Soon the time talks!
Alas ...

207
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:25,223
What beautiful thing.

208
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,790
And it is better than the preachers.

209
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,455
Take it!

210
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:57,262
Silence!

211
00:44:58,009 --> 00:44:59,009
Silence!

212
00:44:59,023 --> 00:45:00,525
I am the author, damn it!

213
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:02,164
Silence!

214
00:45:03,816 --> 00:45:06,478
I Abelardo Castex Vaca, the author.

215
00:45:07,283 --> 00:45:09,154
Abelardo Vaca Castex.

216
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:12,502
God ...

217
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:13,715
Oh, what a waste!

218
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,749
--It is critical now?
--Abelardo!

219
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:19,926
Why not see anyone.
Only one failed after a light.

220
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:22,002
This time this
light is the truth.

221
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,132
Really?
Its light is a shit!

222
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:25,756
Sets the tone, please.

223
00:45:27,831 --> 00:45:28,914
Come here.

224
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:30,125
My dear ...

225
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:32,282
Josephinel
Come here!

226
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,624
Tetro, what are you doing?

227
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,641
Please look at me.
I'm crying.

228
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,402
Okay, okay, okay.

229
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:43,064
Please!
What are you doing? I'll kill you!

230
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:44,293
Bastard!
Come here!

231
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,835
Josephinel

232
00:45:50,627 --> 00:45:52,142
Firm flesh!

233
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:56,366
Silky hair ...

234
00:45:56,502 --> 00:45:58,946
Legs hard!

235
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,990
Tits hard!

236
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:24,740
Touch my flesh and feel ...

237
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:26,220
What penetrating aroma ...

238
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:28,999
And it's not content ...
Mercy!

239
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,609
What vulgar woman!
It's Chanel No. 5.

240
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:36,639
Please!
Chanel No. 5?

241
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:38,479
What is this?

242
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,580
These lines are a disaster!

243
00:46:41,744 --> 00:46:44,570
You do not understand!
Why do I speak Castilian ...

244
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:48,939
What you said is not important.
This language is dead!

245
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,361
Go fuck yourself!
Come with me.

246
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,987
Okay ... Come ...

247
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,761
Come on.

248
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,285
Down!

249
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:58,346
Son of a bitch!

250
00:46:58,947 --> 00:47:01,008
Do not throw that chair!

251
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:09,478
Son of a bitch!

252
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:14,980
Abelardo ...

253
00:47:26,692 --> 00:47:28,699
Welcome back, Alone.

254
00:47:37,843 --> 00:47:39,140
Ladies and Gentlemen,

255
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:41,487
is a pleasure to have you with us.

256
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,584
Alone.

257
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,272
Welcome back, Alone.

258
00:47:54,424 --> 00:47:58,616
I understand here this being
represents a new work in verse.

259
00:47:58,759 --> 00:47:59,775
Fausta.

260
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,059
--Yes.
--Correct?

261
00:48:01,136 --> 00:48:02,178
Yes ..

262
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,399
"Faust" as a woman.

263
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,856
It's fun, you will like.

264
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:09,477
For me it is very fun.

265
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,047
A woman ...

266
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:13,918
But to continue to work.

267
00:48:14,285 --> 00:48:16,674
It will be an honor for us.

268
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:21,821
Come on, boys, come on!

269
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,355
At your posts!

270
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:25,397
Careful with that!
Come!

271
00:48:25,462 --> 00:48:27,854
His clothes, Josefina!
Come!

272
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:29,814
--It is important!
--Come on!

273
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:30,815
Come!

274
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:32,370
--Caio!
--Coming!

275
00:48:33,385 --> 00:48:35,231
Josefina, Hurry up!

276
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,194
--It is a disaster, a disgrace!
--Hurry up!

277
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:39,614
--All ...
--The accordion, please.

278
00:48:39,702 --> 00:48:42,781
Mrs. Alone, champagne?

279
00:48:56,423 --> 00:48:58,476

His father is Carlos Tetrocini?

285
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,047
Of course, as I did not notice that?

286
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:42,801
But you told me in "La Colifata"
your father was...

287
00:50:43,147 --> 00:50:44,512
Was a failed writer.

288
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:46,410
--Do you remember?
--This was me ...

289
00:50:46,464 --> 00:50:48,212
I told you many stories.

00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:52,526
You even stole!

291
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,892
Dammit, Bennie!

292
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:31,636
What did you do?
What is this?

293
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:33,219

Tetro, I go with him.
So what can I call.

What are you doing?

319
01:15:38,227 --> 01:15:39,457
Don't touch me!

I'm the only person who is
always at your side.

325

Always at your side
supporting you.

326

The only person in this damn
life that loves you.

327
01:15:59,145 --> 01:16:00,306
And still want to beat me.

328
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,391

He is 18 ...

335
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,533
This is the famous work of Tetro?

336
01:19:33,806 --> 01:19:36,236
What everyone talks of
but no one saw?

337
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,279
Okay?

338
01:19:44,443 --> 01:19:46,832
I am very happy that
you are here, you know?

339
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:51,845
Need something, Bennie?

340
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:02,170
Ending? Well!

341
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:11,652
We parents and our families
are attached for some time.

342
01:20:14,438 --> 01:20:16,090

Well, well ...

"The desire to travel."
The new work of your brother.

356
01:21:10,002 --> 01:21:11,018
It is very good.
