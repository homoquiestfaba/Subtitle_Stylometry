1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:04,167
(dramatic instrumental music)

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,367
(gentle instrumental music)

3
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,967
- Are you ready to
 call it a night?

4
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,433
- What are you talking about?

5
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,400
Hey, I'm just getting started.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
- It's 1:30, Jeff.

7
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,367
- One more drink?

8
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:33,633
I'm buying.

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,200
(car engine running)

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,867
(upbeat instrumental music)

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,300
(cheering and clapping)

12
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,633
(glass clinking)

13
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:24,133
And to growing old gracefully.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
- You're 26.

15
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,367
- But I feel like an old man.

16
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,300
- You're an old dork.

17
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,367
(laughing)

18
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,367
- We should do this more often.

19
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,667
- What, go out to clubs?

20
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,167
- No, hang out.

21
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,767
I hardly ever get
 to see you anymore.

22
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:42,700
- I know.

23
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,867
This new job at the college

24
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,833
is a little more
 than I'd planned for.

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,133
I mean, there's
 so much to learn,

26
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,700
and the hours are
 totally insane,

27
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,700
and, Jeff, put down the lamp.

28
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,533
Hello?

29
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:55,900
(glass clattering)

30
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,800
Shit, shit.

31
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,567
- Sorry, Cindy.

32
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,300
- And you weren't
 even listening to me?

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,567
- I'll get some paper towels.

34
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:05,767
- No, let's just go.

35
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,600
Let's just go.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
- No, just stay here.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,567
I'm gonna be right back.

38
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,233
(mumbling)

39
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:13,900
(upbeat instrumental music)

40
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,400
- I saw what happened.

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,733
- That was an accident.

42
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,633
- I hope your
 girlfriend's not too mad.

43
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,533
(laughing)

44
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,700
- She's not my girlfriend.

45
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,733
- No?

46
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,100
- No, it's my sister.

47
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,067
- How cute.

48
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,533
- I'd better be going.

49
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,767
- What's the rush?

50
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,067
(cheering)

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,433
(laughing)

52
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,867
- Are you for real?

53
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,367
- Is this real enough for you?

54
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,333
(cheering)

55
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,467
(booing)

56
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:23,100
(gentle instrumental music)

57
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,567
- Jeff.

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,633
Jeff?

59
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,133
Jeff?

60
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,900
Jeff.

61
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:43,667
(insects chirping)

62
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,500
Jeff.

63
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,067
Jeff.

64
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,367
Jeff.

65
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,600
Jeff.

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,067
Jeff.

67
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:55,167
(car engine running)

68
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,333
(siren ringing)

69
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,167
- You live here?

70
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,500
- Yeah, something wrong?

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,867
- Just kind of industrial.

72
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:25,433
- I need a lot of
 space for my work.

73
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,533
- Really, what kind
 of work you do?

74
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,933
- I'm a sculptor.

75
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,533
I work with metals.

76
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,300
- Can I see it?

77
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,567
(foreboding instrumental music)

78
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:38,567
That's nice.

79
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,233
- Are you coming or not?

80
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,700
- It's kind of cold in here.

81
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,200
- You've never done
 this before, have you?

82
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,400
- Of course I have.

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,900
- You wanna go back?

84
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,567
I can take you back.

85
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,700
- Come on, Tisa.

86
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,633
- You don't have to
 if you don't want to.

87
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:12,300
(gentle instrumental music)

88
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,600
- What's that for?

89
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,767
- You can touch,
 but you can't look.

90
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,267
- No fair.

91
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:11,700
- Play by my rules,
 or don't play at all.

92
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,300
- It's kind of tight.

93
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,067
- Don't worry.

94
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,733
(upbeat instrumental music)

95
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,067
- What the,

96
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,067
(dramatic instrumental music)

97
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,467
(grunting)

98
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,967
No. (yelling)

99
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,500
(car engine running)

100
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,167
(phone ringing)

101
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,067
- Hello?

102
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,500
- Cindy, it's Will.

103
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,067
- Hey, you're in town.

104
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,067
I thought you weren't
 supposed to be here

105
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,267
till this afternoon.

106
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,067
- Flight got in a little early.

107
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,133
How are you doing?

108
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,500
- Just trying to keep sane.

109
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,100
It's not easy.

110
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,167
- Everything okay?

111
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,733
- Yeah, I guess.

112
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,067
I still can't believe--

113
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,700
- Yeah, I know.

114
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,067
Hey, you gonna be around
for a little while?

115
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,567
- Yeah, why?

116
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,800
- I thought I'd come on by,

117
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,533
and we can grab
 something to eat,

118
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,833
if you feel up to it.

119
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,100
- I really don't feel
 like going anywhere

120
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
or doing anything,

121
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,333
but if you come by here,

122
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,700
I can make us something.

123
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,267
- You don't have to do that.

124
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:01,567
- No, really, I'd love to.

125
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,933
Do you remember how to get here?

126
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,800
(gentle instrumental music)

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,867
(car engine running)

128
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,067
- What the fuck is this, Tom?

129
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,667
- It looks like some
 sort of cult thing,

130
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,667
yeah, maybe Satanists,
 possibly witchcraft.

131
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,300
I got some guys
researching that symbol.

132
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,600
- And?

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,933
- Nothing yet.

134
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,167
- Well, you better
 find out something

135
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,333
before the next murder happens.

136
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,567
- How do you know
 there's gonna be one?

137
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,067
- This isn't just some
 garden variety serial killer.

138
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,933
Whoever did this is
 following some ancient ritual

139
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:59,767
that tells them how
 and when to kill.

140
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,767
They'll try and do this again,

141
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,533
only next time, you'd
 better be there.

142
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,233
Who else has seen these?

143
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,433
- Nobody outside the precinct.

144
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,767
- Good, I don't want this thing

145
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,200
getting out to the press.

146
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,867
They love making celebrities
 out of these assholes.

147
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:15,367
- Don't worry about it, Chief.

148
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,733
I'll take care of it.

149
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:20,400
(gentle instrumental music)

150
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,867
- Lord, we commit the soul
 of your humble servant,

151
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:47,200
Jeffrey Rodrick Lawton,

152
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,467
and commit his
 body to the ground.

153
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:50,900
Ashes to ashes,

154
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,000
dust to dust,

155
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,500
in the name of the father,
son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.

156
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:04,700
- Thanks.

157
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,400
So how's Seattle treating you?

158
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,300
- Okay, I guess.

159
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,833
My practice is working out.

160
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,633
We have a lot of new clients.

161
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,100
- How long has it been
 since you've come back here?

162
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,900
- Last year, remember?

163
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,800
- Yeah, you came back
 for Jeff's birthday.

164
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,767
- Cindy, I'm sorry.

165
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,800
I didn't mean to bring that up.

166
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,633
- It's okay.

167
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:36,467
It's okay.

168
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,900
It's not your fault.

169
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,867
- You okay?

170
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,300
- Yeah, I'm fine.

171
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,600
God, I miss him so much.

172
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,333
I just can't believe it

173
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,567
that he's gone,

174
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,600
and I keep expecting
him to come in the door

175
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,767
and tell me that it's just
 all a big joke, you know,

176
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,700
but it's not.

177
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,200
He's gone,

178
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,733
and it's my fault.

179
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,967
- Come on, Cindy.

180
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,133
How can you say that?

181
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,433
- Well, the last
 time that I saw him,

182
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,100
we were in this club,

183
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,467
and he went to the bathroom,

184
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,167
and he didn't come back.

185
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,267
I finally went to
 go look for him,

186
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,433
and that's when I saw him leave

187
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,800
with this woman.

188
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,233
- You never told me that.

189
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,200
What woman are
 you talking about?

190
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,767
- I don't know who she was.

191
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,567
- Did you tell
 this to the police?

192
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,433
- Yeah, yeah, course I did.

193
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:30,233
They said, "Not much to go on."

194
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,233
- Did they ever say
 anything about Jeff?

195
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,767
- Not really.

196
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,400
- After they found him.

197
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,567
- No actually.

198
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:42,133
It almost seemed like they
 were holding something back.

199
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:44,900
- Do you remember the name
 of the detective in charge?

200
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,133
- Yeah, Graves.

201
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,600
- Tom Grieves?

202
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,100
- Yeah, that's it.

203
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,867
Where you going?

204
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,767
- Tom and I go way back.

205
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,400
He may be able to
 help us on this.

206
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,233
- I don't want you
 getting involved in this.

207
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,667
- I already am.

208
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:05,400
(upbeat instrumental music)

209
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,667
(cheering)

210
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
(metal clanging)

211
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,733
(laughing)

212
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,833
- Oh, you are something else.

213
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,600
What'd you say your
 name was again?

214
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,067
- Kyra.

215
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,967
- What's that short for?

216
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,600
- It's short for I wanna
fuck your brains out.

217
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,500
(laughing)

218
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,367
- Let's do it right here.

219
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:33,267
- I prefer something
 a little more private.

220
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:34,600
- How about my place?

221
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,067
- I was thinking about mine.

222
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,267
- Whatever makes you happy.

223
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:03,300
- What brings you out
at this late hour, Will?

224
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,733
- Leaving town tomorrow,

225
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,333
thought we could catch up.

226
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,600
- Come on, Will.

227
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,700
You expect me to believe that?

228
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,467
I am a cop, remember?

229
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,067
It's about Jeff
 Lawton, isn't it?

230
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,900
- What do you know about Jeff?

231
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,967
- Well, I know he's dead,

232
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,700
and I saw you at the funeral.

233
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,500
- What were you
 doing at the funeral?

234
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,333
- My job.

235
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,700
What about you?

236
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,967
- Jeff and I've been
 friends since high school.

237
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:39,767
He and his sister are
two of my best friends.

238
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,700
- Sorry, I didn't know.

239
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,967
I wish there was something
 I could tell you about--

240
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,067
- How did he die?

241
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,067
- He was murdered.

242
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,067
- Oh, come on, Tom.

243
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,567
Stop feeding me that shit.

244
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,167
You know something.

245
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,067
Tell me.

246
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,533
I promise it won't
 leave this room.

247
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,600
- Oh, yeah, I know you, Will.

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,100
I don't want you running around

249
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,067
with some badge acting
 like a detective.

250
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,167
- Something you've never
seen before, isn't it?

251
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,733
(gentle instrumental music)

252
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,067
Something awful,

253
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,067
something that scares
 the shit out of you

254
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,833
when you think about it.

255
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,167
- Was nice seeing you, Will.

256
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,100
- Anytime.

257
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,067
(gentle instrumental music)

258
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,167
- This is too much.

259
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
- I'm just getting started.

260
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,367
Do you like music?

261
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,267
- Anything but country.

262
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,400
(upbeat instrumental music)

263
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,867
(gentle instrumental music)

264
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,300
(metal clicking)

265
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,533
What was that?

266
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,467
I know what I saw.

267
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,100
- You're seeing things, baby.

268
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,667
- I knew this was
 too good to be true.

269
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,600
- Come on.

270
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,067
Let's finish what we started.

271
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:11,967
- I don't know what
 you got going on here,

272
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,867
but I'm not interested,

273
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,867
crazy bitch.

274
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,967
(dramatic instrumental music)

275
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:21,800
Fuck, man.

276
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,100
Fuck.

277
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,967
(metal clattering)

278
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,767
(footsteps)

279
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,833
(dramatic instrumental music)

280
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,533
(screaming)

281
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:29,367
(energy whirring)

282
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,533
(groaning)

283
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:52,067
(gentle instrumental music)

284
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,433
- To growing old gracefully.

285
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,767
- [Cindy] You're 26.

286
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,200
- But I feel like an old man.

287
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,800
We should do this more often.

288
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,067
- Jeff, put down
the lamp, hello.

289
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,967
(glass shattering)

290
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,833
(wood thudding)

291
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,633
Will?

292
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,067
Will, is that you?

293
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:27,700
(gentle instrumental music)

294
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,133
(dramatic instrumental music)

295
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,367
(grunting)

296
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,467
Oh my God, Will.

297
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,700
- What are you doing?

298
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,267
- I thought I heard
 somebody come in.

299
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:06,933
- Yeah, it was me.

300
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,567
I was trying not to wake you.

301
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,733
- I called out.

302
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,333
Didn't you hear me?

303
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Oh God, I am so sorry.

304
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,367
(groaning)

305
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,633
Let me get you something
for your shoulder.

306
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,467
Come here.

307
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,433
(mumbling)

308
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,767
- Oh my God. (grunting)

309
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,067
- Let me get something.

310
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,500
I insist.

311
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
- It's okay.

312
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,533
Just no.

313
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:50,467
- Let me get something.

314
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,733
Let me see it.

315
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:55,633
- Come on, Cindy.

316
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,933
It's fine.

317
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:59,700
- This is no time
 to be stubborn.

318
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,400
Oh.

319
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,500
- It's just a bruise.

320
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,533
It'll be healed by morning.

321
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,467
- Shut up.

322
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,700
You always did like arguing.

323
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,233
(laughing)

324
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,967
How'd your meeting go?

325
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,300
- You were right.

326
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,067
Tom's holding something back.

327
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,267
I don't know why,

328
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,600
but I'm gonna find out.

329
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,467
- No, it's okay, Will.

330
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:30,967
Don't push it.

331
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:31,933
I mean, I'm sure
 the police are doing

332
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,700
everything that they can.

333
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,333
- That's the problem.

334
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,167
I'm sure they are too,

335
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,167
but it's not enough.

336
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,600
- Well, what else can we do?

337
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,300
- Got a few ideas.

338
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,600
I'm gonna stick around
here for a little while

339
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,067
and find out what's going on.

340
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:46,233
- Will, you know, I
 don't want you getting

341
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,567
in trouble though, so.

342
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,133
- I'm not leaving
 until I find this out.

343
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,967
- Whatever you find out,

344
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:56,300
it's not gonna bring him back.

345
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,400
- I know,

346
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,600
but Jeff was your brother,

347
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,900
and he was my best friend,

348
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,567
and we all miss him.

349
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,633
(plastic crinkling)

350
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,867
- [Cindy] I think
 it's going down.

351
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,067
- Let's get some sleep.

352
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:10,067
It's been a hell of a day.

353
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,933
Where do you keep your blankets?

354
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,267
- Down the hallway.

355
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,167
- Okay.

356
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,133
- No, you stay here,

357
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:18,367
and we'll be right back.

358
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,367
(plastic crinkling)

359
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,200
How's this?

360
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,333
- Fine.

361
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,067
- You ever think about
 the way it used to be,

362
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:52,667
all of us together?

363
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,600
- Yeah.

364
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,900
(gentle instrumental music)

365
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,633
- You think about me,

366
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,233
about us?

367
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,200
I do.

368
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:13,167
You sure you wanna
sleep out here tonight?

369
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:21,633
(upbeat instrumental music)

370
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,733
- Just like the last guy.

371
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,233
- He's cut up the same,

372
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,633
probably with the same weapon.

373
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:55,433
This facial expression is
 virtually the same too.

374
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,967
- Yeah, well, you'd
 look like that too

375
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,600
if someone cut you up like this.

376
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,900
- Whatever the cause of death,

377
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,067
it had nothing to do
 with these wounds.

378
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,400
- What do you mean?

379
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,067
- On the last victim,

380
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:08,233
the cuts were postmortem.

381
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:09,667
Somebody killed him,

382
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,500
then they cut him up.

383
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,100
- Well, so how did he die?

384
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,700
- Hard to say.

385
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,800
My first inclination
 was a heart attack,

386
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,800
but it looks as if
 his vital fluids

387
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,833
have all been drained,

388
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,167
like someone sucked the life

389
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,967
right out of him.

390
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,267
- This is crazy.

391
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,267
I mean, how could they--

392
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:33,067
- I don't know.

393
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,333
I've never seen
 anything like it.

394
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,067
Whoever's doing this,

395
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,933
they have more on their
mind than just murder.

396
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:43,600
(gentle instrumental music)

397
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,267
(car engine running)

398
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,567
(birds chirping)

399
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:52,700
- Jeff.

400
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,467
Jeff.

401
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:57,500
Jeff.

402
00:25:58,533 --> 00:25:59,367
Jeff.

403
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,133
- Will.

404
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,167
I thought you were leaving town.

405
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,433
- Cindy's still pretty upset,

406
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,067
so I thought I'd stay
 for a few extra days.

407
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,833
- Well, what are
 you doing down here?

408
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,933
- Same thing as you, probably.

409
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,500
- Oh?

410
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,167
- There's been another murder.

411
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,967
- What makes you so sure?

412
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,300
- I can see it in your face.

413
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,433
You always were
 easy to read, Tom.

414
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:46,333
- Why don't you stay
 out of this, Will?

415
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:47,233
- I can't.

416
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,433
I already know too much.

417
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:49,667
- Oh yeah?

418
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:50,500
Like what?

419
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,067
- Jeff left the
 club with a blond.

420
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:55,667
- That's old news, Will.

421
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,333
- They left in a
 blue pick up truck.

422
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,600
License plate was
 B, V, O, 7, M, E.

423
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,767
- How do you know that?

424
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,600
- Cindy and I were talking
 about this last night,

425
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,300
and it suddenly came to her.

426
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,233
Check it out, Tom.

427
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,933
It'll take you two minutes.

428
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,600
- You check this out, Will.

429
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,067
Now we've been friends
 for a long time,

430
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,900
but if I catch you
 snooping around here again,

431
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,233
I'll arrest you.

432
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,667
(car engine running)

433
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,067
Hey, Owen, Tom,

434
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:32,300
listen, check out a vehicle
 ID for me, will you?

435
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,533
Ohio, Bravo, Victor, Oscar,

436
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,167
seven, Mike, Echo.

437
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,333
It's just a hunch.

438
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,500
Car belongs to a prostitute

439
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,100
who's been missing for months.

440
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,200
Her name is Tisa Andrews.

441
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:52,867
- Yeah, that's her.

442
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,100
- Are you sure?

443
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,700
- Well, she looks a
 little weird here,

444
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,300
but yeah, I'm sure.

445
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:01,533
She's the one who left the
 club that night with Jeff.

446
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:04,700
- Well, I also found
 this in her room.

447
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:11,067
Have you seen that
 symbol before?

448
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,367
- Doesn't look familiar, no.

449
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:17,300
- Whoever killed Jeff
 carved that in his chest.

450
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,567
Same with the other guy.

451
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:20,733
(gentle instrumental music)

452
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,933
I'm guessing she's our killer.

453
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:24,333
- Bring me in on this, Tom.

454
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,333
Come on, you've done
okay by me in the past.

455
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,667
- Look, Chief will
 never go for it.

456
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,900
- Come on, Tom.

457
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,433
There's a killer out there.

458
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:32,700
The more time we spend
 talking about it,

459
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,800
the more time they have
to find another victim.

460
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,667
I mean, they're probably
doing it right now.

461
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,267
How much longer do you
 want this to go on?

462
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:39,900
- No way, forget it.

463
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,133
- Look, I know what
 you're thinking.

464
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,067
- I'm surprised you
 even had the nerve

465
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,500
to bother me with this.

466
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,533
- Will knows about the murders,

467
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,933
about that symbol.

468
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,933
- So does half the city.

469
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,367
Have you seen this?

470
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,833
- I'm just trying to help out.

471
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,300
- Well, we don't need your
 kind of help, Spanner.

472
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,733
- It's gonna happen again.

473
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:58,867
- Really?

474
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,700
What makes you so sure?

475
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,267
Are you the killer?

476
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:04,700
- Let's just say that I know
 what we're dealing with,

477
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,867
and you don't.

478
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,200
- That's right.

479
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,467
I forgot.

480
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,067
You're a psychic.

481
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,567
Psychotic's more like it, huh?

482
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,367
Look, you may have him fooled,

483
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,733
but I've been around long enough

484
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,900
to know the reason
 why you got kicked

485
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,533
out of the DA's office.

486
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:22,067
Didn't you know, Tom?

487
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,600
Spanner here is
 into black magic,

488
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,467
thinks he's got
 some kind of contact

489
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,700
with the supernatural.

490
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,233
- Excuse me, Chief?

491
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,133
- Can't you see I'm in the
 middle of something here?

492
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:33,767
- This is pretty
 important, Chief.

493
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,933
We just got a call from
a lady in Smith Grove.

494
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,433
They found another body.

495
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,733
Looks like the same guy.

496
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:40,567
- Thanks.

497
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:43,800
This meeting's over, Grieves.

498
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,833
(gentle instrumental music)

499
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:47,667
- I'm going too.

500
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,767
- The hell you are.

501
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,067
- Oh, come on, Chief.

502
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,567
We need all the help
we can get on this one.

503
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:53,900
- Partners, huh?

504
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,733
Alright, go ahead.

505
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,467
I never heard about it.

506
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:01,533
Grieves, if anything
 gets screwed up,

507
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,033
it's your ass.

508
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:06,000
Now get out of my office.

509
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
- You got it.

510
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,733
(gentle instrumental music)

511
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:12,833
(car engine running)

512
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,433
What's all that talk
 about black magic?

513
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,367
- No, he doesn't
 understand a fucking thing.

514
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,567
- Me neither.

515
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,033
You wanna clue me in?

516
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:25,900
- In college, I did
 a lot of research

517
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,633
into certain taboo religions,

518
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,667
like Voodoo, or Wiccan.

519
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:30,500
- What?

520
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:34,567
- Witchcraft, I want to see
 if there's any truth to it.

521
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,300
- Is that what we're
 dealing with here?

522
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,767
- Maybe,

523
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,667
or maybe something a lot worse.

524
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:43,333
(upbeat instrumental music)

525
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:08,067
(wood thudding)

526
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,567
(metal clattering)

527
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,900
(water running)

528
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,167
(yelling)

529
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,067
- Oh my God.

530
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,067
- I'm sorry.

531
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,100
- I thought you were somebody.

532
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,233
- Are you okay?

533
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,567
- I'm just a little spooked.

534
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,433
I thought I saw somebody
watching me earlier

535
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:07,433
when I was running.

536
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:08,733
- You sure?

537
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,067
What'd they look like?

538
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:11,233
- I don't know.

539
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,733
It was probably
 just the neighbor.

540
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,733
What are you doing
 back so early?

541
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,067
Did you find something?

542
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,067
- Not yet.

543
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:20,500
We're going back out tonight,

544
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,833
gonna check out the clubs.

545
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,067
- Let me come.

546
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,400
- I don't think
 that's a good idea.

547
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,533
- Why not?

548
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:26,633
I'm the only one
that's seen this woman.

549
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,367
- She's seen you too, Cindy.

550
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,267
I just can't risk it.

551
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,900
- Promise me that
 you will find them.

552
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,767
- I will, for you and for Jeff.

553
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:40,433
(gentle instrumental music)

554
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,333
- [Woman] Easy, boy.

555
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,800
- Wow, so that's it?

556
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,433
- Were you expecting
 more than that?

557
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,200
- No, I just thought,

558
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,233
when can I see you again?

559
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,500
(laughing)

560
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:26,400
What's so funny?

561
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:33,100
Man, you are one freaky chick.

562
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:39,967
(car engine running)

563
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:43,800
(dramatic instrumental music)

564
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,500
- How many times are you
 gonna go around this block?

565
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,667
- As many times as it takes.

566
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,733
(car engine running)

567
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,467
- [Will] Here, pull over here.

568
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,400
- [Tom] Do you see her?

569
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
- No, no, I wanna get out.

570
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,100
I think I'll have better luck.

571
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,233
- You going inside?

572
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:18,800
- Yeah.

573
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,067
Park over there.

574
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,833
I'll be back in
 about five minutes.

575
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,467
(upbeat instrumental music)

576
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,733
(yelling and cheering)

577
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:57,667
(insects chirping)

578
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,367
(cheering and clapping)

579
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:12,067
(upbeat instrumental music)

580
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,933
(insects chirping)

581
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:05,467
- This the spot, or what?

582
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:08,533
- My car's down the street.

583
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:09,367
You wanna go?

584
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:10,667
- Let's go then.

585
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:11,500
- You.

586
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,333
- Fuck.

587
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,600
- Who the fuck are you?

588
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,867
- I just saved your life.

589
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:18,700
(dramatic instrumental music)

590
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,567
- You asshole.

591
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,533
- Shit.

592
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:47,533
(car engine running)

593
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,067
Freeze.

594
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:00,800
Get down.

595
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:04,100
- Stay right there.

596
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,333
- Get down now.

597
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,667
Drop it.

598
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,567
(insects chirping)

599
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:14,600
Hey, drop it.

600
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,167
(gun firing)

601
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:30,067
(wood clattering)

602
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,767
(gentle instrumental music)

603
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,633
(dramatic instrumental music)

604
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:46,067
(gun firing)

605
00:38:50,267 --> 00:38:52,100
Well, it's over, Will.

606
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,867
Thank God it's over.

607
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,800
(insects chirping)

608
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,800
(birds chirping)

609
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:26,433
- You know, I hate to say it,

610
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,600
but I'm glad she's dead.

611
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
- I just hope we got
 the right person.

612
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,667
- Well, who else could it be?

613
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,467
I mean, she was with him.

614
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,233
She took him away.

615
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:37,700
- We still don't
 know who killed Jeff.

616
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,367
It could be anybody.

617
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:41,633
- She did it.

618
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:43,467
- I hope so.

619
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,167
- I can do that.

620
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:51,733
- I wish I didn't have to leave.

621
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:52,567
- I know.

622
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,667
I just thought--

623
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,167
- I'll come back.

624
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,067
- When?

625
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,367
- I don't know.

626
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:03,767
I'll call you when I
 get back to Seattle.

627
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:09,300
(phone ringing)

628
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:18,100
- Hello?

629
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:21,267
Tom, yeah, he's still here.

630
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,467
- Tom.

631
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,133
- What is it?

632
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,100
What happened?

633
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,467
- They found another body.

634
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:39,967
- Oh God.

635
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,700
- Tom wants me to come
 down and take a look at it.

636
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,833
- What are you gonna do?

637
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,667
- I can't leave now,

638
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:48,733
not until this is finished.

639
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:50,733
(gentle instrumental music)

640
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:53,800
(car engine running)

641
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,933
- We're doing everything
we can, I assure you.

642
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:03,800
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.

643
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Yes, I know.

644
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,067
Know who that was?

645
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:15,733
Chester Atkins, that's Mayor
 Atkins to you two schmucks.

646
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:17,100
He's ready to tear me a new one

647
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,700
because of this mess.

648
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,133
- Will and I have been working
 overtime on this thing.

649
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,600
- Then maybe you
 should take a rest,

650
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,067
a permanent one.

651
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:28,567
Your investigation
 hasn't turned up shit.

652
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:30,067
- What about that
 girl last night?

653
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,800
- Oh, the one whose brains
 you blew all over the street?

654
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,933
She isn't much help to us dead.

655
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:37,100
- Yeah, but she was
 connected to this,

656
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,367
Cindy Lawton ID-ed her.

657
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,133
She was wearing the symbol.

658
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,533
- Yeah, yeah, I
 heard it already,

659
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,900
but that doesn't
 bring us any closer

660
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,533
to finding the son of
a bitches who did this.

661
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:47,900
For all I know,

662
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,267
you two killed some
 poor, dumb girl

663
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:52,233
who was just trying
 to hustle some guy

664
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,200
for a back alley blowjob.

665
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,800
I got seven dead bodies

666
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,733
and not a single suspect,

667
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,267
and what are you
 still doing here?

668
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,800
I thought your ass would
 be back in Seattle by now.

669
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,200
- Tom called me, thought I
 could still be of some help,

670
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,300
so I stayed.

671
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,567
- Don't bother.

672
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,733
As of now, you're
 both off the case.

673
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:10,200
- What?

674
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,267
You gotta be kidding.

675
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,833
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

676
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:15,900
I'm putting Boyle
 and Harris on it.

677
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,933
Maybe they'll come up with
 something more substantial

678
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,300
instead of wasting civilians.

679
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,267
- Look, Chief, we just
 need one more day on this.

680
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:23,733
We're this close.

681
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:26,067
- You must think I'm
really stupid, Grieves.

682
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,900
- We know who's
 behind these killings,

683
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,667
and we know where to find them.

684
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,200
- So why didn't you bring
 them up here to meet me?

685
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,900
- We have to wait until tonight.

686
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,333
That's when they come out,

687
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,100
and that's when you take them.

688
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,733
- What are you
 gonna do, Spanner?

689
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:40,200
Wave your magic wand

690
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,667
and cast a spell on them?

691
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:43,833
Alright, fine,

692
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:49,233
I'll give you two
 one more night,

693
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,267
but if you fuck up,

694
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:54,200
I'm telling you right now,

695
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,100
I'm putting you on suspension

696
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,100
and you on the first
 plane out of here forever.

697
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:02,167
Got it?

698
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:05,833
(gentle instrumental music)

699
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,333
- [Tom] Have you seen
 that symbol before?

700
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,733
- Doesn't look familiar, no.

701
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:15,267
- [Tom] Whoever killed Jeff
 carved that in his chest.

702
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,933
(phone ringing)

703
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:21,700
- Hello?

704
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,900
- [Man] Cindy Lawton?

705
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,400
- Yeah.

706
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
- [Man] Tell your friend
 to mind his own business,

707
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,567
or you'll both end up
just like your brother.

708
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:33,167
- Who is this?

709
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:35,167
- [Man] Don't forget, Cindy.

710
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:37,200
We're watching you.

711
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,867
(gentle instrumental music)

712
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,067
- Where'd they find Jeff's body?

713
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,500
- The auto scrapyard here.

714
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
- [Will] And the second victim?

715
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,367
- Here.

716
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:06,100
The third was in a parking
 lot on Clifford here.

717
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,600
- And the one we saw
 today was right here.

718
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:18,133
(gentle instrumental music)

719
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:22,067
- Shit.

720
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:23,800
- There's gonna be
 more murders, Tom,

721
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,600
at least two more from
 the looks of this.

722
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,367
Then the ritual's complete.

723
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,967
- Even if you're right, Will,

724
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:33,233
this only shows us where
they dump the bodies.

725
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,800
It doesn't show us where
they pick the men up

726
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,333
or where they kill them.

727
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,700
- That's why we have to go out
 again to the clubs tonight.

728
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,067
(gentle instrumental music)

729
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:44,867
Cindy?

730
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,267
Cindy, you home?

731
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
- Looking for something.

732
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,933
- What are you doing with that?

733
00:46:13,933 --> 00:46:15,933
- I should ask you
 the same thing.

734
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:17,433
- It's just a book.

735
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:18,833
- It's a spell book, Will,

736
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,867
and what the hell are
 you doing with it?

737
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:23,533
- It's something I've
 had for a long time.

738
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:24,900
If you just let me explain--

739
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,367
- I can read what's in here.

740
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,200
It's witchcraft.

741
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,067
It's black magic.

742
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:31,267
- It's not black magic.

743
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:33,767
- What the hell are you
doing with this shit?

744
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:35,833
- I've been into
 it since college.

745
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,267
I never told you and Jeff.

746
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:38,767
It was kind of a secret.

747
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,533
- You practice magic.

748
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,333
- Cindy, please, I--

749
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,567
- Get away from me.

750
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,267
For all I know, you've
 had something to do

751
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:48,067
with this whole fucking thing.

752
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:49,767
- Listen to what you're saying.

753
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:51,400
I've been trying to
find out who killed Jeff

754
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,100
and all those other people.

755
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,267
If it wasn't for this book

756
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:55,433
and these spells,

757
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:57,733
we wouldn't have gotten
as far as we have.

758
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:59,200
- What about this, then?

759
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,633
You told Tom that you
 had never seen it before.

760
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:03,833
- [Will] It's a symbol
of the Order of Shades.

761
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,300
- [Cindy] Order of what?

762
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,367
- The Order of Shades was
 a society of magicians

763
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,133
back in the 1600s.

764
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,533
They committed human sacrifice

765
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:13,133
in hopes of gaining
 supernatural powers.

766
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,300
- Well, why didn't you
 tell us this before?

767
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,067
- At first, I wasn't sure.

768
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,267
Plus, I didn't
 want to upset you.

769
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:20,167
Besides, neither of you
would have believed me,

770
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,467
but now I'm sure.

771
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:22,700
I mean, it's the same,

772
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,533
the snake symbol, the
 murders, everything.

773
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:26,967
- I don't understand.

774
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:28,167
You're talking about something
 that's over 400 years--

775
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:29,200
- I know it's hard to believe,

776
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,133
but it's real,

777
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,567
and it's happening here tonight.

778
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,067
- Oh my God, Will,
 I'm so scared.

779
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:37,100
Somebody called a
 couple of hours ago.

780
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,433
They knew you were here,

781
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:40,300
and they said that if
 you didn't stay away,

782
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,567
that we'd both end up dead.

783
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,333
Oh my God.

784
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,067
- Cindy, we have to stop them

785
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:49,067
before they complete the ritual.

786
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:51,067
- How are you gonna do that?

787
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:52,633
- Tom and I have a plan.

788
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:54,233
- Right, and you're
 gonna leave me out

789
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:56,500
while you guys go out
 and risk your life again.

790
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,433
Well, not this time.

791
00:47:57,433 --> 00:47:58,267
- I told you before, Cindy.

792
00:47:58,267 --> 00:47:59,100
It's too--

793
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,067
- I know, I know.

794
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:01,500
It's too dangerous.

795
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,433
Well, I'm tired of being on
 the outside of this thing.

796
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:03,100
Whether you like it or not,

797
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,833
I am involved.

798
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:07,933
(car engine running)

799
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:26,533
- You're late.

800
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,500
- Cindy wanted to come.

801
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,633
- So what'd you do?

802
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:34,200
- Put a spell on her.

803
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,133
- You're a funny guy, Will.

804
00:48:36,133 --> 00:48:40,600
Well, I hope your plan
 is better than your joke.

805
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,700
- Having second thoughts?

806
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,733
- What the hell?

807
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:48,733
Chief's gonna put my
 ass in a sling anyway,

808
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:50,200
and you're going home tomorrow.

809
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,067
- I'm not going anywhere
till this is over.

810
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:55,200
- Whatever.

811
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,867
Let's get this done.

812
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,700
(tape ripping)

813
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:12,267
You and Cindy got
 something going on?

814
00:49:12,267 --> 00:49:15,667
- We used to date
 back in college.

815
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:16,733
- I mean now.

816
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,533
- Yeah.

817
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:27,100
- Well, she seems like
 a pretty nice girl.

818
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,167
I'd bang her.

819
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,267
- So you done with this?

820
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:36,267
- Say something.

821
00:49:37,633 --> 00:49:39,300
- You are a fuckwad.

822
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,633
- Alright, get out of here.

823
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:54,333
Pretty sure of
 yourself, aren't you?

824
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,667
- I think I know what
 they're looking for.

825
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:59,333
- Yeah, well, you be
 careful with that mic.

826
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,433
We lose that,

827
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,933
you're on your own.

828
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:12,067
(car engine running)

829
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:21,867
(upbeat instrumental music)

830
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:25,133
(cheering and yelling)

831
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:57,500
(insects chirping)

832
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:23,367
(upbeat instrumental music)

833
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:26,633
(cheering and yelling)

834
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,500
- [Rana] Hey, is
this seat taken?

835
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,267
- No, go right ahead.

836
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:42,267
- [Rana] You're
 not alone, are you?

837
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,433
- Not anymore.

838
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,600
- I mean, you look anxious

839
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,800
like you were
 looking for somebody.

840
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,300
I'm Rana.

841
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,700
- Will.

842
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:53,900
(gentle instrumental music)

843
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,733
I'm sorry.

844
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:57,500
Would you like
 something to drink?

845
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,067
- Sure, that'd be great.

846
00:51:59,067 --> 00:52:00,367
- What are you having?

847
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,333
- I'll have what you're having.

848
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,067
- I'll be right back.

849
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,933
(upbeat instrumental music)

850
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:08,200
(insects chirping)

851
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,633
- I'm here.

852
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:11,133
- [Will] I've got one.

853
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:12,267
- Are you sure?

854
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:13,200
- [Will] I'm sure.

855
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,133
She's wearing the symbol.

856
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:14,933
- Alright, I'm coming in.

857
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:17,400
- [Will] No, no, wait.

858
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,167
I'm gonna pull a (mumbling).

859
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:23,933
- Okay, okay, you
 keep her there.

860
00:52:25,067 --> 00:52:26,467
I'm watching your back.

861
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:27,867
- [Will] Will do.

862
00:52:29,633 --> 00:52:31,067
(upbeat instrumental music)

863
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:34,333
(cheering and clapping)

864
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,433
- Here's to your
 chance encounters.

865
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,767
So you live around here?

866
00:52:57,767 --> 00:52:59,333
- Actually, I'm just
 passing through.

867
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,300
I'm here for the convention.

868
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,700
- Which one?

869
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,133
- Real Estate Developers
of Southern California.

870
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:06,367
- Sounds interesting.

871
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:09,400
- Yeah, right, just a
bunch of stiffs in suits

872
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,067
trying to figure out where
 to build the next mini-mall.

873
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,067
Just what America needs, right?

874
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:16,400
- You don't seem
 like a stiff to me.

875
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,867
Wanna go somewhere?

876
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:19,633
- What have you got in mind?

877
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:20,867
- A little out of the way place

878
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:23,600
where we can get to know
each other, hang out.

879
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,933
What do you say?

880
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:27,300
- Sure.

881
00:53:28,633 --> 00:53:31,067
(insects chirping)

882
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:33,933
So you gonna tell me
 where we're going?

883
00:53:33,933 --> 00:53:34,967
- Can't do that.

884
00:53:34,967 --> 00:53:35,800
- Really?

885
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,733
Why not?

886
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,067
- It'd ruin the surprise.

887
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:40,367
- [Will] What surprise
 are you talking about?

888
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:42,467
- [Rana] You'll find out.

889
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,800
(car engine running)

890
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:23,900
- So do I pay you now or--

891
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,467
- You think I do this for money?

892
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,400
Don't be insulting.

893
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,167
I do this for the thrill,

894
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,067
for the danger,

895
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:35,567
but you're not
 dangerous, are you?

896
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:36,633
- I might be.

897
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:42,233
(car engine running)

898
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,600
(gentle instrumental music)

899
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,833
- So make yourself at home.

900
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,933
- You got any light?

901
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:59,233
I like to see what I'm doing,
 if you know what I mean.

902
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:00,467
- Sure.

903
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:04,100
(gentle instrumental music)

904
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,333
Here, let me help you with that.

905
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,900
- Oh, I got that.

906
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:22,333
- Okay, whatever.

907
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:31,500
Now it's your turn.

908
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,767
- You got a bathroom?

909
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:35,467
(laughing)

910
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:37,233
I've been drinking,
 you know, and--

911
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,533
- You're not chickening
out on me, are you?

912
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:42,233
I might have to kill you.

913
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:43,300
Right down the hall,

914
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,833
first door on the right.

915
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,767
You might wanna
 take this with you.

916
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,933
Don't be too long, now.

917
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:54,767
- Thanks.

918
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,133
(gentle instrumental music)

919
00:56:12,433 --> 00:56:13,267
Tom.

920
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:15,267
Tom, can you hear me?

921
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:17,700
I'm in a warehouse
 with the girl.

922
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,967
(mumbling)

923
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,233
Fuck.

924
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:28,500
- I'm tired of waiting, Will.

925
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,533
- Oh, I'm ready to go.

926
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:33,333
- Good, 'cause I want you now.

927
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:37,067
(upbeat instrumental music)

928
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,200
(car engine running)

929
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,833
See, I told you
 that wouldn't hurt.

930
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,700
- I've got to go.

931
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,967
- What's the rush?

932
00:57:13,967 --> 00:57:15,100
Come on, baby.

933
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,933
- Some other time.

934
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,733
- Stay a little longer.

935
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:18,567
- No.

936
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,433
Later.

937
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:30,900
- Suit yourself.

938
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,567
(gentle instrumental music)

939
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,333
(dramatic instrumental music)

940
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,800
(energy crackling)

941
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,967
- Who are you?

942
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,900
Do you really think
 you can stop me?

943
00:57:58,733 --> 00:58:00,900
(yelling)

944
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,433
- Freeze.

945
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,500
Let him go now, you fuck.

946
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,267
(gun firing)

947
00:58:15,267 --> 00:58:17,167
(coughing)

948
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:19,867
(grunting)

949
00:58:19,867 --> 00:58:21,067
Will, come on.

950
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:22,067
You alright?

951
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:23,100
- Tom, don't go there.

952
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,067
Don't, don't.

953
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,633
He's not moving.

954
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:26,800
Tom, oh, shit.

955
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:30,733
Tom, let's go.

956
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:32,167
Tom, let's go.

957
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,833
Now, Tom, goddammit.

958
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,333
- [Tom] What the
 fuck is this thing?

959
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:37,167
- Goddammit, let's go.

960
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:38,100
(gun firing)

961
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:38,933
Come on.

962
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,867
(energy whirring)

963
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:44,700
- No.

964
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,867
(yelling)

965
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:52,967
(energy whirring)

966
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:53,800
- Tom.

967
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,133
Tom.

968
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,767
(dramatic instrumental music)

969
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:01,600
Fuck, Tom.

970
00:59:09,433 --> 00:59:10,267
Fuck.

971
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:19,067
(brakes squealing)

972
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,267
(phone ringing)

973
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,100
- Yeah.

974
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,367
- Burns, it's Will.

975
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:35,067
- Where the fuck are you?

976
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,067
- You have to come down
to the warehouse now.

977
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:39,533
- I haven't heard anything
 from you guys all night.

978
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:40,933
Put Tom on the phone.

979
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:41,900
- I can't.

980
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,367
- Why the hell not?

981
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:44,700
- He's dead.

982
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,967
- Look, if this is
 your way of saying

983
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:47,067
you haven't found anything--

984
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:48,500
- Get your men together.

985
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,933
Come down to the warehouse
 on Fifth and River.

986
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:51,600
I'll meet you there.

987
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:56,533
(gentle instrumental music)

988
00:59:58,633 --> 01:00:00,367
The body was right here.

989
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,733
He must have hid
it or something,

990
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:05,433
or maybe he came
 back and took it.

991
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:07,267
- Search the building.

992
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,500
You wanna tell me what's
really going on here?

993
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,533
- Last night, we found
 one of the girls.

994
01:00:15,533 --> 01:00:16,700
We followed her here,

995
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,167
then moved in.

996
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:19,000
They killed Tom,

997
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,833
and tried to kill me--

998
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,000
- Wait a second.

999
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,533
The girl you're
 following killed Tom?

1000
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:24,167
- Not the girl,

1001
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,400
someone else.

1002
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,633
The girls aren't
 doing the killing.

1003
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:27,833
They're working for someone,

1004
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,433
someone with the power
 to make them kill,

1005
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:31,433
even kill themselves.

1006
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:33,033
The girls are just slaves.

1007
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,200
- So it's some
 kind of cult thing,

1008
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,600
like Jim Jones or Manson.

1009
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,567
- No, Manson was just a man.

1010
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:41,600
We're dealing with something
 completely different here.

1011
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,767
- All I know is that you and
Tom both owe me an explanation.

1012
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:51,333
Now go home, and
 clean yourself up.

1013
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,000
We'll take care of it here.

1014
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,900
(car engine running)

1015
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,567
(gentle instrumental music)

1016
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,933
- Cindy.

1017
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,800
- Who's there?

1018
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,633
- It's me.

1019
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:12,467
Open up.

1020
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:17,800
- [Cindy] I don't
 want you in here.

1021
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,400
- Cindy, open the door.

1022
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,967
I can explain.

1023
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:22,167
- I don't wanna see you again.

1024
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:23,600
- Please, please.

1025
01:01:28,733 --> 01:01:30,300
- What do you want?

1026
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,600
- I have to tell
 you what happened.

1027
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,633
- I know what happened.

1028
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:36,833
You put a spell on me

1029
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,500
so that I wouldn't
 wake up, you bastard.

1030
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,733
- It was for your own good.

1031
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:41,067
I was only trying
 to protect you.

1032
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:43,367
- Protect me from what?

1033
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:44,733
- Tom's dead.

1034
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:46,133
- What?

1035
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:47,433
- He's dead, Cindy.

1036
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:48,933
They killed him.

1037
01:01:48,933 --> 01:01:50,133
- How do you know that?

1038
01:01:50,133 --> 01:01:50,967
- I was there.

1039
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:51,800
I saw it.

1040
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,933
I saw everything.

1041
01:01:52,933 --> 01:01:54,067
It's worse than I thought.

1042
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:55,500
It's not even human.

1043
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,833
- Not human, what are
 you talking about?

1044
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:01,067
- The Order of Shades,
 it's real, Cindy.

1045
01:02:01,067 --> 01:02:02,933
It's not just something
from an old book.

1046
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:04,133
This guy's going around,

1047
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:06,067
and he's killing people
as human sacrifices.

1048
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:08,200
That's how he gets his power.

1049
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,733
- I don't believe you.

1050
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:11,567
You're crazy.

1051
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:13,100
- They just have
 one more sacrifice

1052
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,433
to complete the ritual tonight.

1053
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:17,067
- Well, then, why don't
we just call the police?

1054
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,400
- The police won't help us.

1055
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,633
Nobody will.

1056
01:02:19,633 --> 01:02:21,067
It's up to us.

1057
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:22,567
- What can we do?

1058
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:24,200
- There's a few things
 I'll need to prepare,

1059
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
but we can't do it here.

1060
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,067
They know we're here.

1061
01:02:27,067 --> 01:02:28,067
They know about me.

1062
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:29,433
They know everything.

1063
01:02:29,433 --> 01:02:30,500
We have to leave.

1064
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,867
- Where are we going?

1065
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:33,733
- I'll figure it out on the way.

1066
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,633
We just can't stay
 here any longer.

1067
01:02:35,633 --> 01:02:36,633
I need to pick up a few things

1068
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:37,467
from the bedroom,

1069
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:38,300
and then we can--

1070
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,133
(wood thudding)

1071
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:39,967
- Open up.

1072
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:40,900
It's the police.

1073
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,633
(dramatic instrumental music)

1074
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:43,800
Spanner, we know
you're in there.

1075
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,600
Open up, or we're coming in.

1076
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,433
(dramatic instrumental music)

1077
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,800
(car engine running)

1078
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,133
Shit.

1079
01:03:13,433 --> 01:03:17,100
(gentle instrumental music)

1080
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:45,500
- The Order of Shades
 committed human sacrifices

1081
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,067
to the serpent god Malius.

1082
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:49,667
Victims were typically seduced

1083
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:52,200
and then killed by
 the high priest.

1084
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,667
Six victims were
chosen at random

1085
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:58,800
with the final victim
sacrificed at midnight.

1086
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,467
(phone ringing)

1087
01:04:05,267 --> 01:04:06,333
Hello?

1088
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:07,567
- It's Will.

1089
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:08,500
- I can't talk to you.

1090
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,667
- Please, Cindy, don't hang up.

1091
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:11,533
- Did you kill him?

1092
01:04:11,533 --> 01:04:12,933
- What?

1093
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,233
- The police found Tom's body.

1094
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:15,300
They think you did it.

1095
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,133
- Come on, Cindy.

1096
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:17,133
You know me.

1097
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,400
- I thought I knew you.

1098
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,567
- No, I know you're scared,

1099
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:23,333
but I didn't kill anyone.

1100
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,167
This whole thing's a set up.

1101
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,833
Now, please, listen.

1102
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,067
I need your help.

1103
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:28,967
- I can't.

1104
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:29,933
They're after you.

1105
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,667
- In the bedroom, my suitcase,

1106
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:32,933
did they take anything?

1107
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:34,167
- No.

1108
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:35,800
- Good, I'm gonna need
 some of that stuff.

1109
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,300
Now I'm gonna come
 by the house tonight.

1110
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,533
- Will, hold on.

1111
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:40,100
- Just promise me
 you'll be there.

1112
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,767
Cindy, I love you.

1113
01:04:41,767 --> 01:04:45,433
(gentle instrumental music)

1114
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,533
Cindy?

1115
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:24,733
(wood thudding)

1116
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:30,167
Cindy?

1117
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:37,833
(phone ringing)

1118
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:40,767
Hello?

1119
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:41,967
- [Man] Will Spanner?

1120
01:05:41,967 --> 01:05:42,900
- Who is this?

1121
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,500
- [Man] You know who this is.

1122
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,900
We have Cindy here with us.

1123
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,867
- What do you want?

1124
01:05:47,867 --> 01:05:49,633
- [Man] If you value her life,

1125
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:50,833
you'll come to us.

1126
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:52,100
- Let me talk to her.

1127
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,333
- [Man] I make the
 demands here, not you.

1128
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:57,600
Come to us now, or Cindy dies,

1129
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,167
and come alone.

1130
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:01,667
We'll know if you try anything.

1131
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,867
- Alright, I'm coming.

1132
01:06:03,867 --> 01:06:05,133
Just don't hurt her.

1133
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:08,067
- [Man] Look forward
 to seeing you, Will.

1134
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:11,733
(gentle instrumental music)

1135
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,700
- You must be Will.

1136
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,700
The master is waiting.

1137
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,867
Follow me.

1138
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:49,233
(gentle instrumental music)

1139
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:51,567
(footsteps)

1140
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:09,767
After you.

1141
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:21,233
- Hi, Will.

1142
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:23,300
Nice to see you.

1143
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,700
- Where's Cindy?

1144
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,633
(laughing)

1145
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:29,467
I want to see her now.

1146
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:31,867
Cindy.

1147
01:07:31,867 --> 01:07:33,600
(screaming)

1148
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,700
- [Cindy] No.

1149
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:37,367
- Calm yourself, Will.

1150
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,067
I could kill her in a heartbeat.

1151
01:07:39,067 --> 01:07:40,533
- Let her go.

1152
01:07:40,533 --> 01:07:43,833
- I will, but first, you
 must submit to your fate.

1153
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,100
Kneel before me.

1154
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,400
- Fuck you.

1155
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,767
I'm not doing shit until
Cindy's out of here.

1156
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:50,267
- Fair enough,

1157
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:51,800
but I have what I want.

1158
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,733
What do you have, Will?

1159
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,533
- I'll snap her fucking neck.

1160
01:07:57,533 --> 01:07:59,533
(laughing)

1161
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,900
(mumbling)

1162
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,367
- Will, Will, Will.

1163
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:05,933
- [Will] You think I'm kidding?

1164
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,200
(gentle instrumental music)

1165
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,600
- They're nothing to me, Will.

1166
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,600
They'll do anything I tell them,

1167
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,733
even enjoy their own death.

1168
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:19,733
(moaning)

1169
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:22,067
(screaming)

1170
01:08:33,533 --> 01:08:36,933
But I need you to
 complete the ritual.

1171
01:08:36,933 --> 01:08:38,967
That's why I summoned you.

1172
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:42,133
You will be the final sacrifice.

1173
01:08:42,133 --> 01:08:44,700
(ropes creaking)

1174
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,867
(panting)

1175
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:49,900
- No, no, Will.

1176
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:57,500
- Who the hell are you?

1177
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,767
- Don't you know yet, Will?

1178
01:08:59,767 --> 01:09:01,867
I've been around for ages,

1179
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:04,100
much longer than you.

1180
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,333
- Bullshit.

1181
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:06,700
You're just some
wannabe warlock,

1182
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,067
pissed off at the world.

1183
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:10,667
- You're a fool to
 talk like that, Will.

1184
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,700
Do you want to know who I am?

1185
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:13,867
I'll show you.

1186
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:16,500
(dramatic instrumental music)

1187
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,167
(screaming)

1188
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:20,167
I am Malius.

1189
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:24,767
For centuries, I've
waited for this moment.

1190
01:09:24,767 --> 01:09:27,800
Tonight, we begin a new era,

1191
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,800
an eternity of darkness.

1192
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,567
- Are you done yet?

1193
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:36,800
- Usually I'll wait till
 they are dead to do this,

1194
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,233
but in your case, I'll
 make an exception.

1195
01:09:42,067 --> 01:09:44,400
(screaming)

1196
01:09:45,967 --> 01:09:48,133
(panting)

1197
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:52,067
(growling)

1198
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,900
Oh, don't die yet,
 Will, not yet.

1199
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,867
I want to savor this moment.

1200
01:09:57,867 --> 01:10:00,133
(grunting)

1201
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,333
Goodbye, Will.

1202
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,600
- [Cindy] No.

1203
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:09,667
(growling)

1204
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:12,700
(screaming)

1205
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,700
- [Malius] Kill her now.

1206
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,933
(grunting)

1207
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:25,033
- No.

1208
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:27,867
(energy whirring)

1209
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,900
Oh my God, Will.

1210
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,700
- Will, you'll never
 leave here alive.

1211
01:10:51,033 --> 01:10:53,367
The ritual must be completed.

1212
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:56,133
The final sacrifice
 must be made.

1213
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,567
- Cindy, don't look.

1214
01:10:59,567 --> 01:11:01,967
- She cannot resist me, Will.

1215
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:04,467
- No, Cindy.

1216
01:11:04,467 --> 01:11:08,767
- Come to me, Cindy. (growling)

1217
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:09,833
- I love you.

1218
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,733
- [Malius] Come to me now.

1219
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:14,067
(growling)

1220
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,933
(energy whirring)

1221
01:11:20,933 --> 01:11:23,267
(screaming)

1222
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:30,067
(metal clattering)

1223
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:34,300
(panting)

1224
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:45,500
(gentle instrumental music)

1225
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:51,267
- Oh, God, Will.
