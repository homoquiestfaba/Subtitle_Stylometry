1
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:04,572
(tense music)

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,150
(Jenny sighs)

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,452
[Jenny] Where do I begin?

4
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:22,690
My father would say,
"Start with history."

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,593
But do you start at
the beginning of time

6
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:28,763
or just current events?

7
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,163
Anywhere in the world,

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,567
or just at home?

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,167
Our nation is the enduring dream

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,572
of every immigrant who ever
set foot on these shores

11
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,742
and the millions still
struggling to be free.

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,547
This is a great contest
between hope and fear.

13
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:49,651
This is a contest between
unity and division.

14
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,654
A contest between
the courage to change

15
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:55,188
and the comfort
of the status quo.

16
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,492
We are looking on the edge
of a revolution of young people

17
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,228
who are starting to realize
that we, our generation,

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,764
put them four trillion in debt

19
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,699
and they don't like
it and they shouldn't.

20
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,535
My name is Anita F. Hill.

21
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,671
I was scared and I was alone.

22
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:11,438
Can we all just get along?

23
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,240
Can we get along?

24
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:18,278
(tape rewinding)
(intense punk music)

25
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,787
[Jenny] Maybe I should
start with my story.

26
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:30,692
(intense punk music)

27
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:47,575
So...

28
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,477
Why Harvard?

29
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,748
When I was nine years old,
I visited Harvard with my dad.

30
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,717
I remember standing
in the Harvard Yard

31
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,885
and seeing all the fall colors.

32
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,921
It was like something
out of the movies.

33
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:05,158
I remember everybody there
seemed so important, so serious,

34
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,395
and that my dad was one of them.

35
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,230
It was like the
best of the best.

36
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,636
And that's when I realized
that I wanted to be one, too.

37
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,340
(students chattering)

38
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,144
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

39
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,347
Let me see this.

40
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,751
Uh, what asshole put
AP chem first period?

41
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:32,419
- I know, I'm gonna die.
- Oh my God.

42
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,621
How was your summer?

43
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,956
It was fun. I
hung out with Drea.

44
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:35,823
Oh, good.

45
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:37,457
Hola, chica.

46
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,360
What is on the menu for today?

47
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,797
I actually have AP
chem first period.

48
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,231
Oh my gosh.

49
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,300
Same! We can be study buddies.

50
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,836
Owen, I've known you
since freshman year.

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,872
We both know you don't study.

52
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:51,873
Oh.

53
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:55,510
You hurt me.

54
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,412
Kelly Norman, what's up?

55
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,715
Owen Riley, color me surprised.

56
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,382
(Owen chuckles)

57
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,584
(bell rings)

58
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:04,986
Well, enjoy your
ridiculous science.

59
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,821
I'll see you in English.

60
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,723
Ready for chemistry?

61
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,358
[Teacher] Good morning, and
welcome to the wonderful world

62
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,228
that I like to
call AP chemistry.

63
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,465
The wonderful world of AP chem.

64
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,267
So what are you looking
forward to this school year?

65
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,703
What I'm really
looking forward to

66
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:22,737
is this year's election.

67
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,838
[Interviewer] And why is that?

68
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,908
Because I'll be 18 in time.

69
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,442
Have you been
following the coverage?

70
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,610
Oh yeah.

71
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:32,714
When Ross Perot dropped out in
July, I couldn't believe it.

72
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:34,414
Was he the candidate you
were going to vote for?

73
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,850
Oh, no.

74
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,819
But it made everything
so much more interesting

75
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,386
with his third party run.

76
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,755
Let's sort of do a quick summary

77
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:42,990
of what we discussed before
in terms of where we are,

78
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,391
then we'll go to the solution.

79
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,860
I've offered a
comprehensive plan.

80
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,328
And my agenda for
American renewal,

81
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,733
an integrated, comprehensive
set of answers.

82
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,267
We're going to ask the
rich to pay their fair share

83
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,270
so the rest of America
can finally get a break.

84
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,941
I wish it were that
easy, but it is not.

85
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:03,511
And it will take new solutions,
comprehensive solutions...

86
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,881
Since we're dealing
with voodoo economics,

87
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:11,284
a great young lady from
Louisiana sent me this voodoo stick

88
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,554
and I will use it as
my pointer tonight.

89
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,858
Why is this an important
year in US history?

90
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,328
It's the year of the election.

91
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,933
Why is this an
important election?

92
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,836
[Girl] Because
it's the President.

93
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,540
(students laughing)

94
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,308
This is the first
presidential election

95
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:39,514
since the fall of the Soviet
Union, the end of the Cold War,

96
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,851
followed by a brief
but controversial

97
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,053
Gulf War in the Middle East.

98
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,924
Last year, a man was
pulled from his truck

99
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:52,894
and beaten by cops.

100
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:58,633
This spring, the
officers were acquitted,

101
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,903
sparking riots that
lasted for days.

102
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,006
We're in an economic downturn.

103
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,011
What is the temperature
of the country right now?

104
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,854
This year is touted as
the year of the woman.

105
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,523
There are how many
female candidates

106
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:23,891
on the ballot in November?

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,664
How many of you will
be old enough to vote?

108
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:38,338
Congratulations, it is
an honor and a right.

109
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,141
This is one of the foremost

110
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,375
pieces of literature
in the world,

111
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,979
quoted and analyzed to death,

112
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,981
and you will do the same.

113
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,917
I need four volunteers
to read act one.

114
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:55,690
Mr. Riley, how lovely to
have you in my class, again.

115
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:56,924
Always a pleasure.

116
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:58,993
Mm-hm.

117
00:05:59,026 --> 00:05:59,827
All right.

118
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:04,431
Okay, you three young ladies,
please open your books.

119
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,035
Ms. Johnson, how
was your summer?

120
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:08,903
It was fun.

121
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,138
Thank you, how about yours?

122
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,673
Short.

123
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,908
Yeah.

124
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,943
I'm applying early
decision to Harvard

125
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,979
and I would appreciate
some help on my essay.

126
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:21,782
Well, when you have a draft,
we'll schedule some time.

127
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:24,652
Tell me something I can't
read in your application.

128
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,821
Who are you?

129
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,892
What are the things
that make you, you?

130
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:34,494
Movies, books,
television, music.

131
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,598
Everyone who applies for
Harvard has an excellent GPA,

132
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:40,001
is overloaded with
extracurriculars,

133
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,469
and some are legacies
like yourself.

134
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,971
What makes you stand out?

135
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,578
So tell us about your interview.

136
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,546
It was okay.

137
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,084
You tell him about your 4.0,

138
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:59,086
your literary magazine,
all your classes?

139
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,922
Oh mom, the mole is so good.

140
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:01,989
Mm-hm.

141
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,426
[Jack] Delicious.

142
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,631
[Michael] It's pretty good.

143
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,099
(Camelia chuckles)

144
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,035
[Michael] I think you should
sign up for the SAT again.

145
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,106
But I did so well.

146
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,978
Statistics show
that students score

147
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:27,181
at least 100 points better
the second time around.

148
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,916
[Jenny] But I got a 1460.

149
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,119
Then a 1560 would get you

150
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:34,155
closer to a perfect
score, won't it?

151
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,227
[Camelia] So, how
was your day, Jack?

152
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,165
Upper management...

153
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,202
Came up with some new nonsense

154
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,104
and everybody nods
their head and says,

155
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,907
"Yes please, I want some more."

156
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,042
Like lambs to a slaughter.

157
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,048
Maybe you should do
something fun this weekend.

158
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:02,616
You know, go see a movie.

159
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,651
Go for a bike ride.

160
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,687
[Jenny] Who am I?

161
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,190
Who am I?

162
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,863
Who am I?

163
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,064
[Jack] You have no idea!

164
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,933
[Camelia] Jack!

165
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,568
[Jenny] Who am I?

166
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,206
Do you ever feel like there's
a black hole inside of you?

167
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,877
(intense punk rock music)

168
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,683
The music fills me up,
but sometimes I wonder...

169
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:37,752
♪ Oh, traitor traitor ♪

170
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:38,953
Maybe I want to get sucked in.

171
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,757
♪ Whoa, traitor traitor ♪

172
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,927
♪ Whoa, traitor traitor
traitor traitor ♪

173
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:51,966
♪ Whoa, yeah ♪

174
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:56,637
♪ Whoa oh oh ♪

175
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,105
♪ Whoa oh oh ♪

176
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,240
Oh, open. Oh, sorry.

177
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,108
Dad stop.

178
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,043
- What?
- Stop.

179
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,044
- What?
- No, stop.

180
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:03,844
Oh, that would've...

181
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,279

00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,360
First time I have
the opportunity

364
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,730
to go to the Republican
National Convention,

365
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,298
it's here in Houston, I'm
not even sure I want to go.

366
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:22,837
Bush is talking about
all this new policy,

367
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,806
this new attitude.

368
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,741
Well, I already
know his attitude.

369
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,678
[Jenny] I kept waiting for
them to notice something.

370
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,516
I wonder if I looked
different somehow.

371
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,851
If they would be able to tell.

372
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,656
(upbeat punk music)

373
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:43,591
[Jack] You follow the money.

374
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,693
Well, I know where
his money comes from.

375
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:47,762
(Jack seal barking)

376
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,630
So...

377
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,331
I'm interested in...

380
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,883

Mom, why did you
never teach us Spanish?

396
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,372
Um, they say it's harder

397

401
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,783
I told your father never
to speak Spanish again.

402

Did he ever, did he
ever try to learn for you?

That's assuming I'll get in.
- You'll get in.

541
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:17,771
Mm, and if not, then
community college.

542
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,774
Apply again in a year or two.

543
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:22,176
Probably not a bad idea anyways.

544
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,145
It would be so much cheaper.

545
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:29,683
I don't, I don't
even have a plan B.

546
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:32,052
Uh well, duh, you're
going to Harvard.

547
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,355
Yeah, but I don't know.

548
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:36,757
I never even thought of like,
what if I don't go to Harvard?

549
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,791
It doesn't matter.

550
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,160
You'll get in.

551
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:42,696
I'll go to UT and
I'll get financial aid

552
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,266
and maybe a scholarship or four.

553
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,268
You know, I'm the
one who has to stick

554
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:51,438
with the stay in school and
don't get pregnant plan.

555
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:52,406
You can do whatever you want.

556
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,108
Fuck the plan.

557
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:57,411
Eh, I can't get pregnant,
or do any, you know what?

558
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:01,282
I'm not. I'm a bad Riot Grrrl.

559
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,184
(Drea laughs)

560
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:04,318
Don't make me laugh.

561
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:09,089
(upbeat punk rock music)

562
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:11,325
I think it looks
pretty, and cool.

563
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:15,329

564

Oh my God, your parents...

567
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,312
Hey, quit it.
(Jenny chuckles)

568
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,213
Whoa, what happened?

569
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:34,081
[Jenny] Nothing.

570
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,416
(game music blaring)

571
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:38,252
- You made me die!
- Oh whatever, that was you.

572
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:39,086
(controller smacks)

573
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,821
- Ah!
- Shit.

574
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:43,357
(Camelia speaking in Spanish)

575
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,925
[Michael] Mom.

576
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:46,961
(Jenny sighs)

577
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:47,828
Shit.

578
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:57,071
You should probably
hold his head down.

579
00:28:57,104 --> 00:28:57,938
Que pasó!

580
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,009
I just needed a change.

581
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:04,512
You look like a boy.

582
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,149
(Camelia sighs)

583
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:14,388
I'm starving, is
the food ready yet?

584
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,456
What happened buddy?

585
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:21,262
What happened?

586
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:22,463
It was an accident.

587
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,898
Cutting your hair
was an accident?

588
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,467
What? No, I just
needed a change.

589
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:28,135
What kind of impression
is this gonna make?

590
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:31,005
- It's a haircut.
- You look like a lesbian.

591
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,273
(Jenny scoffs)

592
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:34,275
You don't have permission
to mutilate your body.

593
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:35,876
I didn't.

594
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,378
It's hair.

595
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,280
It's my hair, it's my body.
I can do whatever I want.

596
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:40,948
What's gotten into you?

597
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:41,549
Nothing has gotten into
me, I'm just sick and-

598
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,383
Go to your room.

599
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:44,118
[Camelia] Jack.

600
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:47,087
You know what? Whatever,
I'm going back to Drea's.

601
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,455

00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:02,836
I just want to go to my room.

acting like an asshole.

00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:07,434
Jennifer.

624
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:10,672
What is this?

625
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,574
It's nothing, Mom.

626
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:17,411
(Camelia sighs)

627
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:20,180
Come with me.

628
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,185
(soft music)

629
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:34,529
I don't understand.

630
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,029
Your father doesn't believe

631
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,465
so he did not want you to
be raised in the faith.

632
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:43,036
But, I baptized you myself
when you were babies.

633
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:47,341
Who cares about what dad says?

634
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,276
You are so lucky.

635
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:55,550
My father didn't like
for me to go to school.

636
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:58,452
Even my own mother thought I
should simply learn cooking

637
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:03,190
and taking care of the
house, but I wanted to go.

638
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:05,025
I wanted to learn.

639
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,562
I wanted to be a doctor.

640
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,263
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

641
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,634
But my grades
weren't good enough.

642
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:15,670
And without the
support of my family...

643
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:18,640
Eh.

644
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:25,312
But your father, he works very
hard to give you the best.

645
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,652
You should trust him to
know what's best for you.

646
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:38,325
Whenever I have a problem or
a worry I come here and I sit.

647
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,093
And pray?

648
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:43,430
To God?

649
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,298
Mm-hm.

650
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,636
(soft music)

651
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:15,329
Mijo no, you must say a prayer
for each candle you light.

652
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,566
Who do you light a candle for?

653
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:20,535
My family.

654
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:23,671
In Mexico?

655
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:30,578
And you and Michael,
and your father.

656
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,051
Say a prayer, light a candle.

657
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:43,591
For what?

658
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,292
That is up to you.

659
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:49,429
(pensive music)

660
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:29,469

661
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,172
(pensive music)

662
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,748
(Jenny sighs)

663
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,318
Miss Johnson.

664
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,355
Did you take every
pamphlet we have out?

665
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:25,727
Oh dear, what happened to
Harvard early decision?

666
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:28,428
That's still the plan.

667
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:32,800
Just wanted to see what
else was out there.

668
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,770
What are you planning
on majoring in?

669
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,407
My dad says to
keep my options open,

670
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,810
excel in every subject
and decide in college.

671
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:45,747
Is that what you think?

672
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:50,652
Well, see, I'm
good at every subject

673
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:53,655
so that's not really
that big of a deal,

674
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:57,692
but the only subject that
I really love is English.

675
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:59,961
Well, brown-nosing me isn't
going to get you anywhere.

676
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:01,596
I'm serious, I do.

677
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:04,866
I love the words, the
imagination, the impact but,

678
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:08,703
like what career do
you make out of this?

679
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:09,771
Like a writer?

680
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,305
Teacher?

681
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,577
Tell me about the haircut.

682
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:20,280
It's just a haircut.

683
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:22,950
Not many people would
make such a radical change.

684
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,452
Well, I'm still me.

685
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:30,825
Just wanted to try something
new, something different.

686
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:33,961
Is that important to you?

687
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,263
Trying something new, different?

688
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,369
Hm, we have big universities,

689
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:45,606
small liberal arts
colleges, Midwest,

690
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,309
East Coast, California,
Reed College.

691
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:52,914
I like the
nontraditional structure.

692
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:54,549
[Miss Johnson] Do you now?

693
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:56,951
I don't know.

694
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:57,819
I just...

695
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:03,024
I don't know.

696
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:07,729
It just feels like any and
everything is interesting. Ah.

697
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:12,834
Well, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

698
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:16,504
Doesn't really matter
where you go to college.

699
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:18,305
What matters is what you
do when you get there

700
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:19,439
and what you do when you leave.

701
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:20,908
Who you become in the process.

702
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,580
How's the essay coming along?

703
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:31,451
How am I even supposed
to know what to write about

704
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:33,921
if I can't even figure
out where to apply to?

705
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:35,355
Oh, that's the easy part.

706
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:36,858
It's called a personal
statement for a reason,

707
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:39,026
because it's personal
and it's a statement.

708
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:41,529
Kinda like that haircut.

709
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:47,902
(inquisitive music)

710
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,828
[Owen] Oh, when did this happen?

711
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:18,800
Just needed something different.

712
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,867
It's soft.

713
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:23,571
You don't think
I look like a dyke?

714
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,308
You're still gorgeous, if
that's what you're asking.

715
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,047
Are you telling
me you like girls?

716
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,850
(Jenny laughs)

717
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:42,723
What do you do when everything
just seems to be too much?

718
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:49,597
Any and all mood
enhancing substances.

719
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,432
Not the biggest fan of alcohol,
but it'll do in a pinch.

720
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:56,070
How do you function
at this school?

721
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:01,075
I have a genius IQ,
a State Rep father,

722
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,410
and a mother on
the school board.

723
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:10,450
I just, I just need to get
out of my head, you know?

724
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:18,025
I don't have anything on me
right now, too bad, so sad.

725
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:23,064
But, there are other ways
of getting out of your head.

726
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:38,813
Mr. Riley.

727
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:41,782
Miss Johnson.

728
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:44,986
Control yourselves, or I
will have to write you up.

729
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:49,891
(Owen and Jenny laugh)

730
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:51,926
(phone ringing)

731
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,060
[Camelia] Hola.

732
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:56,030
"Hamlet: Is this is a
prologue or the posy of a ring?

733
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,933
Ophelia: 'Tis brief my Lord.

734
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:02,103
Hamlet: As woman's love."

735
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,607
I would go crazy too, Ophelia.

736
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:14,115

(Camelia speaks in Spanish)

739
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:02,096
[Jenny] What the
hell just happened?

740
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:05,833
(distorted chattering)

741
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:08,069
What the hell just happened?

742
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,237
How am I supposed ever
figure out who I am

743
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,206
if I don't even know
where I came from?

744
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,874
Welcome to adulthood.

745
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:28,222

I made your favorite
for dinner tonight.

753

Tamales?

Okay, I guess.

758
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,160
You're gonna wear this.
You're officially an adult now.

759

Oh my gosh don't say
that. Don't say that.

761
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:12,833
Everybody make sure
you've got your goggles on.

762
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:17,171
Now, if it's acidic,

763
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,774
what color should the
litmus paper turn?

764

765
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:26,080
[Boy] Red.

766
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:27,181
You got it.

Cool.

(Owen gasps)

770
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:49,970
It's acid.

771
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:54,175
Stop, you'll poison
yourself one of these days.

772
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,710
Most drugs are
laced with something.

773
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:57,878
Jesus Christ, now I'm
gonna think about it

774
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,146
the next time I do it.

775
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:01,916
Next time?

776
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:04,985
Yeah.

777
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:10,324
Also, why are you doing
all the work? Here.

778
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:11,992
Pipette, enjoy.

779
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:21,302
Me gusta mucho tamales.

781
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:24,705
Bravo.

782
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:31,178
(insects buzzing
in the distance)

783
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:49,697
So, Dad, how was your day?

784
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,000
Long.

785
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:03,177
You want to go see
a movie this weekend?

786
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:07,348
Yeah, sure.

787
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:08,215
What's out?

788
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:12,853
I don't know.

789
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:16,257
But I heard that there's
this new theater policy.

790

00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,571
Oh my gosh, I only
get these things here.

811
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:11,438
I like your hair.

812
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:13,474
I had a similar cut
when I was young.

813
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:14,942
Really? In Vietnam?

814
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:18,279
My daughter, she lucky
to know you as a friend.

815
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,281
Going to Harvard.

816
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:22,349
You can learn so much from her.

817
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:24,318
(Drea scoffs)

818
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,020
I got to get to work.

819
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:30,824
(Drea laughs)

820
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,233
I love my mom, I do.

821
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,402
And I feel like an asshole

822
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:44,271
because I know how much
she sacrificed but,

823
00:46:46,508 --> 00:46:49,143
sometimes I just
want a mom, you know?

824
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:54,415
Someone to make me waffles
and tell me to go to bed.

825
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:57,117
Someone to wake me
up if I've overslept

826
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:58,385
and drive me to school.

827
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:00,487
She's a survivor.

828
00:47:00,522 --> 00:47:05,392
She's like the fucking
toughest person I know.

829
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:09,296
But as soon as my brother and I

830
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,499
were able to do some
things by ourselves,

831
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:15,869
she needed us to take
some of that pressure off.

832
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:20,474
Now it just feels like we're
all just surviving together.

833
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:28,015
Damn.

834
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:33,287
Both my parents are role
models in different ways.

835
00:47:35,122 --> 00:47:37,157
I appreciate my
father's work ethic

836
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,059
and my mom's devotion
to the family.

837
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:51,038
In my family, the man
has all the power.

838
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:56,377
(whispered chattering)

839
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,048
If our bodies are a battleground,
then what are our minds?

840
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:02,416
Are they separate or the same?

841
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:06,554
If you control my body,
do you control my mind?

842
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:10,924
There are no laws for
thought, only for action.

843
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:15,630
But people believe that
if you control one,

844
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:17,998
you control the other.

845
00:48:21,536 --> 00:48:24,506
Miss Johnson. (sighs)

846
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:26,674
This is a mess.

847
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,010
"They're calling this
the year of the woman

848
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:33,615
and movements like Riot Grrrl
that don't ask for equality

849
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,650
but take it without apology.

850
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:38,218
In my family, the man
has all of the power,

851
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:41,288
so how am I supposed
to find my own?"

852
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:46,126
Dissecting how society's
patriarchal dynamics

853
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,327
play out in your own family

854
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:51,265
as you explore your independence
as a woman is a good start,

855
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:56,203
but this is an emotional
torrent of victim hood.

856
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,472
You're not showcasing how this

857
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:00,542
will fuel your further studies

858
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:02,544
or your contributions
to society.

859
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:07,615
This whole women in punk music

860
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:11,285
is always talking about
accepting your anger

861
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:15,523
and standing up and
fighting for your rights.

862
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:18,091
It's all so inspiring but I
just, I don't, I don't know.

863
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,027
I don't know how
to put it out there

864
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,530
without sounding
like a huge mess.

865
00:49:22,564 --> 00:49:24,131
Well you edit it.

866
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:26,967
Use that critical mind
you've honed here.

867
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:31,205
Carving out sense from something
emotional is difficult.

868
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:34,441
Yes, especially when you're
so biased, but not impossible.

869
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:37,177
You think I'm biased?

870
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,613
Well, let me ask you this,

871
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,583
your mother chose your father

872
00:49:41,616 --> 00:49:44,652
and every time he
acts like a patriarch,

873
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:47,187
she chooses him again, why?

874
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:53,026
So you're saying
that she wants that?

875
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:55,429
And that's not okay?

876
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:59,634
You want your parents to
respect your choices an adult.

877
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,268
Can you accept theirs?

878
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:06,406
Do you believe that your
father, in his mind,

879
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,242
is doing what he
thinks is right?

880
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,647
I mean, he could do
it in a better way.

881
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,115
Well, are you always
doing everything

882
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,251
to the best of your abilities?

883
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:23,825
I was just, I'm just...

884
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:25,660
I hate how I can't
change anything.

885
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,363
I mean he never listens.

886
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,566
I have no power, my
mom has no power.

887
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:37,672
There is no perfect choice.

888
00:50:37,705 --> 00:50:41,676
Just a choice, which leads
to another and another.

889
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,778
But thinking and
planning and stressing

890
00:50:43,811 --> 00:50:46,548
doesn't give you any more
control over the outcome.

891
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:50,183
Your father is still
fighting that lesson.

892
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:52,820
You have a chance
to learn it now.

893
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:54,689
Oh.

894
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:58,693
This is so exhausting.

895
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:02,597
Go back over your paper

896
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,799
as if you were an
admissions person.

897
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:06,601
Use emotion where
it's effective,

898
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:09,102
but make sure the
reasoning is sound.

899
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:13,106
[Moderator] I just want
to thank the three panelists

900
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,610
and thank the three
candidates for participating,

901
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:18,478
President Bush, Governor
Clinton and Mr. Perot.

902
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:21,749
They will appear again
together on October the-

903
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:29,857
(Camelia humming
in the distance)

904
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:35,697
Why don't you take
out your college essay

905
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,197
and we'll go over it together.

906
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,635
Ms. Scattergood
has it covered.

907
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:44,204
Jennifer.

908
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:45,272
It's not finished.

909
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:47,809
Then we'll work on it together.

910
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:54,549
(Camelia singing in
foreign language)

911
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:39,226
(Jack clears his throat)

912
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:43,631
(Jenny sighs)

913
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:17,832
What is this?

914
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:28,375
All I've ever wanted
was for you to succeed,

915
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:33,413
to be anything you ever
dreamed of becoming.

916
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:37,819
I work so hard to make sure

917
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:42,289
that you have anything you need

918
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:44,424
and I'm some sort of monster?

919
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,528
Your mother and I,
we are partners.

920
00:53:47,562 --> 00:53:48,629
She is not a victim.

921
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:50,397
You treat her like dirt.

922
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:54,869
You never let her speak

923
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:56,470
and you never let her
speak Spanish to us,

924
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:57,839
which probably makes you racist,

925
00:53:57,872 --> 00:54:00,273
which I don't even want to
know what you think of me.

926
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:05,312
And you think, you think
that Mom agrees with you,

927
00:54:06,614 --> 00:54:08,516
because it's
impossible for anybody

928
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:10,618
to have another opinion
other than yours.

929
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:16,758
And you may not beat us, but
you definitely control us.

930
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:17,825
Hey, Jennifer.

931
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:20,728
Are you done?

932
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:21,596
No, I'm not.

933
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,668
You can't dictate me.

934
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,037
I'm 18 and I'm going to college

935
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:32,874
and I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing with my life.

936
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:36,544
I'm scared to try anything new

937
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:37,879
because I'm scared of failing.

938
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:42,349
But I don't want
to go to Harvard.

939
00:54:50,091 --> 00:54:52,794
(tense music)

940
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:02,970
We used to be pals.

941
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:15,650
When did you decide you
couldn't talk to me?

942
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:21,689
I don't know if I ever could.

943
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:29,530
(melancholy music)

944
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:34,467
(Jack clears throat)

945
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:41,843
The kids that go to
that fancy private school

946
00:55:41,876 --> 00:55:46,881
that you go to are
from wealthy families,

947
00:55:48,749 --> 00:55:50,017
prominent in the community.

948
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:54,155
They are all going to
Ivy League schools.

949
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,824
They have trust funds.

950
00:55:57,725 --> 00:55:58,826
You don't.

951
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:04,665
What you do have is access

952
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,437
to a very exclusive club,

953
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,774
one that can open
up any door for you.

954
00:56:15,176 --> 00:56:18,546
You want to experiment?
You want to explore?

955
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:24,719
They have the power
for you to do that.

956
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:26,053
They can give you all of that.

957
00:56:27,622 --> 00:56:32,526
Don't throw it away
before you even get there

958
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,929
because they don't
let you in twice.

959
00:56:45,773 --> 00:56:48,910
Not very smart for a
smart girl like you.

960
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:54,849
(pensive music)

961
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:33,054
Not very smart.

962
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:34,055
[Jenny] Fuck him.

963
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:36,590
[Jack] I'm some sort of monster?

964
00:57:36,624 --> 00:57:37,825
For you to succeed.

965
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:38,960
Your mother and I,
we are partners.

966
00:57:38,993 --> 00:57:40,161
She is not a victim.

967
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:43,698
[Jenny] I don't
wanna go to Harvard.

968
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:46,801

Good evening from the
University of Richmond,

979
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:25,206
where tonight the
candidates and the voters

980
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:27,108
mix it up in a
freewheeling format

981
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:29,143
that's never been tried before.

982
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:31,812
This evening will be part
debate, part game show,

983
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:34,248
part talk show,
and all important.

984
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:37,918
For your reports
on the election,

985
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:41,022
I want you to watch
the TV coverage tonight

986
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:45,226
and write a summary of
the event and its results.

987
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:50,031
What if our parents
won't let us stay up late?

988
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:54,869
Get up early in the morning
and read the newspaper.

989
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:57,738
Mr. Riley.

990
00:58:57,772 --> 00:58:59,240
Can we do it as a group project?

991
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,110
I suppose.

992
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:05,980
[Jack] Excited?

993
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:07,948
[Jenny] What if I punch the
wrong one and vote for Bush?

994
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:09,850
[Jack] You're not supposed
to say who you're voting for.

995
00:59:09,884 --> 00:59:13,220
[Jenny] I said who
I'm not voting for.

996
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:15,289
Where is everyone?

997
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:17,758
[Owen] At some
election night thing.

998
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,063
They didn't make
you go with them?

999
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:25,766
They try and give me space.

1000
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:28,702
When I told my dad
I was coming here,

1001
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:31,672
he was expecting this
whole big political party.

1002
00:59:31,705 --> 00:59:32,339
Nope.

1003
00:59:34,175 --> 00:59:35,142
Just little old me.

1004
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:39,847
[Isabel] Ah ah!

1005
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,818
(speaking in Spanish)

1006
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,929
Isabel's tamales are bomb.

1007
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:56,197
She makes 'em like once a week

1008
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,665
and I just eat my
way through them.

1009
01:00:00,234 --> 01:00:04,171
(speaking in Spanish)

1010
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,142
Gracias, Isabel.

1011
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:13,214
(Isabel speaks in Spanish)

1012
01:00:15,316 --> 01:00:18,252
So you wanna get
fucked up tonight?

1013
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:21,856
You can.

1014
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:23,858
You don't have to worry,
I'll take care of you.

1015
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,192
No one's here to stop you.

1016
01:00:29,864 --> 01:00:32,099
So you wanna get fucked up?

1017
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:35,336
I already feel fucked up.

1018
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,876
Wanna get out of your head?

1019
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:52,086
(soft music music)
(Jenny and Owen panting)

1020
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:58,225
Is it wrong that I
kinda think that's sexy?

1021
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:01,962
(Owen grunts)

1022
01:01:01,996 --> 01:01:03,264
[Jenny] Take your shoes off!

1023
01:01:03,297 --> 01:01:06,167
(both laughing)

1024
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:08,002
Yes!

1025
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,277
Is this okay?

1026
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,214
What?

1027
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:22,716
I don't know.

1028
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,984
I just keep asking
myself, so this is it?

1029
01:01:26,453 --> 01:01:29,223
(both chuckle)

1030
01:01:30,525 --> 01:01:32,726
(Jenny sobs)

1031
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,495
Oh, shit.

1032
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:37,064
No just don't, don't stop.

1033
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:46,173
(Owen sighs)

1034
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:52,413
Did you vote today?

1035
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:53,247
Mm.

1036
01:01:56,784 --> 01:01:58,118
What? It's not gonna
make a difference.

1037
01:01:58,152 --> 01:01:59,753
Texas is solid red.

1038
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:02,289
You asshole.

1039
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:05,960
Oh, are we breaking
up all ready?

1040
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:10,264
I'm kidding. I
voted with my dad.

1041
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:17,004
(soft music)

1042
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:27,348
- Jesus, Mom.
- Where were you?

1043
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:30,251
I was watching the
election for my assignment.

1044
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:31,852
The election
doesn't go this late.

1045
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:33,988
- I fell asleep on the couch.
- What's going on?

1046
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:36,357
Aye Mija, I was
not born yesterday.

1047
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,965
I will always worry about you.

1048
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,243
(phone line trilling)

1049
01:02:56,277 --> 01:02:57,478
[Drea] Hello.

1050
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:00,814
(Jenny exhales)

1051
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:02,249
Hey asshole, you
should get a life

1052
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:04,318
and stop calling teenage
girls just to breathe heavily

1053
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:06,387
and not say anything, all right?

1054
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,489
Fuck off, don't call again.

1055
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,359
(Jenny laughs)

1056
01:03:16,497 --> 01:03:18,065
(phone line trilling)

1057
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:18,899
[Drea] Are you kidding me?

1058
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:19,967
Drea, it's...

1059
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,901
(Jenny laughs)

1060
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:21,569
It's Jenny.

1061
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:25,906
(Jenny sighs)

1062
01:03:25,939 --> 01:03:28,275
So, what happened?

1063
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,378
[Student] Um, Clinton won.

1064
01:03:33,013 --> 01:03:35,149
[Jenny] Why does having
sex mean you're now a woman?

1065
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:38,252
Why does it mean we
have to be together?

1066
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:40,421
[Teacher] But not in Texas.

1067
01:03:42,456 --> 01:03:45,492
[Jenny] I don't even know
what I'm thinking or feeling.

1068
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:48,462
Although for a minute, I
forgot about everything.

1069
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:55,069
We now have six women in the
Senate and 47 in the House.

1070
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,471
Six out of 100 in the Senate

1071
01:03:57,505 --> 01:04:01,875
and 47 out of 400 in the
House isn't exactly a lot.

1072
01:04:02,544 --> 01:04:05,913
Well it's more than before.

1073
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:07,981
We've had so many
election cycles

1074
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:10,918
when we said this is the year
when women are going to win

1075
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:13,521
and then, you know,
something happens.

1076
01:04:13,555 --> 01:04:17,391
That horizon of gender
equity is limitless for us.

1077
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:22,630
And what we see today is
simply a dress rehearsal

1078
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:25,966
for the day and time
we meet in convention

1079
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:27,968
to nominate Madam President.

1080
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:29,436
(crowd cheering)

1081
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:33,374
So, is this change,

1082
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:35,577
or is this progress?

1083
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:40,280
[Jack] Making me
out to be the bad guy.

1084
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:41,448
You're driving a
wedge between us.

1085
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:42,449
[Camelia] No, all I wanted-

1086
01:04:42,483 --> 01:04:44,519
[Jack] No, you read that essay.

1087
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:45,419
God damn it.
(glass shattering)

1088
01:04:45,452 --> 01:04:49,624
[Camelia] Jack.

1089
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:52,527
(ominous music)

1090
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,264
(indistinct shouting
in the distance)

1091
01:04:57,297 --> 01:04:58,198
[Michael] Jenny.

1092
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:02,369
Hey.

1093
01:05:04,037 --> 01:05:06,273
[Jack] What are you doing,
putting ideas in her head.

1094
01:05:06,306 --> 01:05:07,107
[Camelia] No!

1095
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,242
(door slams)

1096
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:10,144
Let me go tuck you back in.

1097
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,484
We don't just need
a new generation,

1098
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,320
we need a new gender of
leadership in America.

1099
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:23,190
(people cheering)

1100
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:24,491
[Announcer] You don't
have to go this far

1101
01:05:24,526 --> 01:05:26,427
for a new Cadillac
or Oldsmobile.

1102
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,662
Westminster Motors knows

1103
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:30,998
you have to go a
little bit further.

1104
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:33,601
I uh, didn't apply.

1105
01:05:33,635 --> 01:05:35,469
[Jack] Sure you did.

1106
01:05:35,503 --> 01:05:37,304
Application's
completely filled out.

1107
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,509
I can't believe you opened it.

1108
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,345
Robert McGill, the
guy that interviewed you

1109
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,215
is having a holiday
party next week

1110
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:49,517
and he's extended the invite.

1111
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:53,020
His son, who also
goes to Harvard,

1112
01:05:53,053 --> 01:05:56,390
is having a few of his friends
over that you can meet.

1113
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:58,526
[Camelia] And you get
to wear your new dress.

1114
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:01,696
[Jack] I'm so proud of you.

1115
01:06:01,729 --> 01:06:03,197
This is really good news.

1116
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:05,733
Oh.
(Jack snaps fingers)

1117
01:06:05,767 --> 01:06:07,569
News, news is about to start.

1118
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:08,969
Where's the remote control?

1119
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:12,105
The news is starting right now.

1120
01:06:14,642 --> 01:06:15,543
Congratulations.

1121
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:16,544
[Jenny] I didn't apply.

1122
01:06:16,578 --> 01:06:17,344
[Jack] Sure you did.

1123
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:18,713
Application's
completely filled out.

1124
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:21,482
[Camelia] You get to
wear your new dress.

1125
01:06:21,516 --> 01:06:24,485
(melancholy music)

1126
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:26,220
[Owen] Ruh Roh.

1127
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:32,527
I got into Harvard.

1128
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:35,195
What?

1129
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:37,197
- Yay.
- That's awesome.

1130
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:42,102
You deserve it, it's
what you wanted.

1131
01:06:44,606 --> 01:06:46,206
It's what I want.

1132
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:50,277
It is what I want.

1133
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:52,647
[Jack] Congratulations.

1134
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,681
[Jenny] I didn't apply.

1135
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:55,115

(Jenny sighs)

1138
01:06:57,752 --> 01:07:00,622
What I want, is
to get fucked up.

1139
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:05,527
[Jack] Application's
completely filled out.

1140
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,661
[Camelia] You get to
wear your new dress.

1141
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:07,461
[Jack] Congratulations.

1142

This is your night, enjoy.

1145
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:25,479
Jack.

1146
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:27,782
- Robert, good to see you.
- You too, how are you?

1147
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:29,182
Fantastic.

1148
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:29,784
You remember my
daughter, Jennifer.

1149
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:31,351
I certainly do.

1150
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,555
She left quite the
impression at her interview.

1151
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:34,689
My son Parker's right over there

1152
01:07:34,722 --> 01:07:36,323
if you want to say hello.

1153
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:42,797
Let's get you a drink.

1154
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:44,131
[Jack] Let's do that.

1155
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:51,438

01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:57,177

Martin?

1158
01:07:58,646 --> 01:08:00,147
You went to my school.

1159
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,149
- Class of 1990.
- Yeah.

1160
01:08:02,182 --> 01:08:04,752
I'm sorry, what is your name?

1161
01:08:04,786 --> 01:08:06,654
Jenny. Jenny Johnson.

1162
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:09,591
How funny, it's
like the Jetson's.

I'm Parker, Robert's son.

1167

Uh, do you go to Harvard?

1168
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:20,635
[Parker] I graduated last year,

1169
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:22,269
now I oversee bonds in the city.

1170
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:24,739
So you're a legacy?

1171
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,508
Yeah.

1172
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:28,375
Lucky you.

1173
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:37,150
Well, it was great
to see you again.

1174
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:39,319
And it was so good to meet you.

1175
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:40,655
Yeah, all right.

1176
01:08:41,823 --> 01:08:42,657
Bye.

Hey, dad.

1179
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:18,693
- Excuse me.
- All right.

1180
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:20,862
Can we go?

1181
01:09:20,895 --> 01:09:22,664
I'm kinda tired.

1182
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:24,297
We just got here.

1183
01:09:27,535 --> 01:09:29,804
Some of these people
may be your future.

[Camelia] Hola,
Johnson's residence.

1187
01:09:57,565 --> 01:09:58,766
Hi, Mom.

1188
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:01,803
Could you come pick me up?

1189
01:10:01,836 --> 01:10:04,572
I'm bored and Dad
doesn't want to leave.

1190
01:10:04,605 --> 01:10:06,239
[Mom] Mija, give it a try.

1191
01:10:06,273 --> 01:10:09,276
Not just for your future
but for your father, too.

1192
01:10:10,812 --> 01:10:12,513
Okay.

1193
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:13,380
Bye.

1194
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:20,922
(Jenny sighs)

1195
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,402
Hey, where were you?

1196
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:36,436
Your father called.

1197
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,939
He is worried sick.

1198
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:39,339
He's on his way home.

1199
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:40,875
Why?

1200
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,677
He wanted to stay, I wanted
to go, so I called a taxi.

1201
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:46,647
(tense music)

1202
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:55,857
What's gotten into you?

1203
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,728
What's wrong?

1204
01:11:00,762 --> 01:11:02,797
Everything is wrong, Dad.

1205
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:05,700
I don't want to go to Harvard

1206
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:07,835
and you're just not
listening to me.

1207
01:11:10,004 --> 01:11:13,908
Everybody gets nervous.
It's perfectly normal.

1208
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:15,009
You're gonna be okay.

1209
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:17,912
Everything's gonna be fine.

1210
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:33,561
Is that the best hug
you can come up with?

1211
01:11:33,594 --> 01:11:35,897

1212
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:47,474

whispered chattering)

1213
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,458
[Owen] Happy Friday.

01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:08,529
[Jenny] Owen.

1215
01:12:08,563 --> 01:12:10,698
No way, J, what are you doing?

1216
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:11,933
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1217
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:13,868
Party at mine?

1218
01:12:15,503 --> 01:12:16,971
Maybe.

1219
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:19,807
There's actually this
concert coming up, yeah.

1220
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:22,710
Oh cool, scary chicks
screaming. I can dig it.

1221
01:12:22,743 --> 01:12:26,446
Hey, they're proving
a point, you know, okay?

1222
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,583
They're angry, women are angry

1223
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:30,051
and they have every
right to be angry

1224
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,451
about so many different things

1225
01:12:31,484 --> 01:12:33,453
and you wouldn't know
about this, okay?

1226
01:12:33,486 --> 01:12:34,689
Okay, okay, you're right.

1227
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:37,959
You know what? You
don't get it, whatever.

1228

1229
01:12:42,997 --> 01:12:45,967

It's a punk concert.

Where is this concert?

1249
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,602
Does it matter?

1250
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:56,604
I'm 18, I can go wherever
I want with whoever.

1251
01:13:56,637 --> 01:13:57,470
(hand slams)

1252
01:13:57,505 --> 01:13:58,639
Jack!

1253
01:13:58,673 --> 01:13:59,774
That's enough of this.

1254
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,581
I'm not gonna
tolerate that behavior

1255
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:09,717
while you are under this roof.

1256
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:13,020
Are you kicking me out?

1257
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:13,988
What? No.

1258
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:17,825
No, of course not.
- Dad.

1259
01:14:17,858 --> 01:14:20,995
Are you kicking me out?

1260
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:24,598
You're 18.

1261
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:27,234
An adult under the law.

1262
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,839
But let me remind
you of something,

1263
01:14:31,872 --> 01:14:33,473
you're still in high school,

1264
01:14:35,276 --> 01:14:37,979
a school I pay a
pretty penny for

1265
01:14:39,246 --> 01:14:43,718
Then I'll go to a public
school or I'll get my GED.

1266
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:52,626
Is that what you want?

1267
01:14:55,096 --> 01:14:57,164
Throw all of your hard work,

1268
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:59,633
everything you've worked
for, right down the drain?

1269
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:02,737
Just tell me.

1270
01:15:04,605 --> 01:15:05,239
Tell me.

1271
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,210
'Cause I just might
grant you your wish.

1272
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:15,149

1273
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:19,053

1274
01:15:19,086 --> 01:15:20,554
[Mom] Hello?

1275
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:22,089
I'm sorry Andrea, Jenny's
not available right now.

1276
01:15:22,123 --> 01:15:23,190
Mom, I got it.

1277
01:15:23,224 --> 01:15:25,026
[Drea] Oh, hey.

1278
01:15:25,059 --> 01:15:26,994
Drea, my parents
are being psycho.

1279
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:28,029
- Jennifer!
- [Drea] Uh.

1280
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:29,230

I dropped acid.

01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,176

1314
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:36,190
Was it Andrea?

1315
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,225
Maybe you should take
her to the hospital.

1316
01:17:38,259 --> 01:17:39,260
A doctor can't do anything.

1317
01:17:39,293 --> 01:17:41,262
Maybe we should call the police.

1318
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:43,464
I'm 18, I could go to real jail.

1319
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:44,899
We gotta call the school.

1320
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:46,300
If you got that from
anybody, anybody!

1321
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:48,335
You could get expelled.

1322
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:49,937
You could get brain damage.

1323
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,138
Brain damage.

1324
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,873
Your kids, they're gonna
have birth defects.

1325
01:17:52,907 --> 01:17:56,177
Brain damage.
(Jenny chuckles)

1326
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:59,180
You do realize that
I'm, like, hallucinating?

1328
01:18:06,287 --> 01:18:08,422

1329
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:12,459
[Jack] Why would you do this?

1330
01:18:12,493 --> 01:18:14,929
[Camelia] Don't wake Michael.

1331
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:16,197
She's not listening Jack-

1332
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,831
[Jack] I told you
she would lose focus.

1333
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:19,366
[Jenny] I need a
pencil and paper.

1334
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,801
I have to write
something down. A pen?

1335
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:22,036
[Jack] Hush!

1336
01:18:22,069 --> 01:18:22,836
[Jenny] I need to
write something down.

1337
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,004
[Jack] No, damn it!

1338
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:25,372
I need a highlighter,
Sharpie, quill...

1339
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:27,841
Oh.

1340
01:18:29,176 --> 01:18:30,277
I need a crayon.

1341
01:18:30,311 --> 01:18:32,379

1344
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,351

1345
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:38,352
What's gotten into you?

1346
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:40,387

1347
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:42,489

01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:51,398

01:25:34,602 --> 01:25:36,738
And me and your brother.

1426
01:25:40,675 --> 01:25:42,710
He has a weird
way of showing it.

1427
01:25:45,647 --> 01:25:48,683
Sometimes we hurt the
ones we love the most.

1428
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:52,720
That's terrible.

1429
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:56,824
You'll understand someday.

1430
01:25:56,858 --> 01:25:57,925
No, I won't.

1431
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:13,473
You want me to rub your
back and sing you a lullaby?

1432
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:15,843
Yeah.

1433
01:26:17,244 --> 01:26:17,879
Yeah?

1434
01:26:23,618 --> 01:26:27,454
(singing in foreign language)

1435
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:09,764
[Jenny] I can't
believe I did that.

1436
01:27:10,798 --> 01:27:12,399
But somehow I feel lighter.

1437
01:27:14,736 --> 01:27:15,570
Relieved.

1438
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:19,907
Happy to be alive.

1439
01:27:24,912 --> 01:27:26,748
[Camelia] Breakfast!

1440
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:40,895
How are you feeling?

1441
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:41,963
I'm good.

1442
01:27:51,839 --> 01:27:53,508
So, you want to go see a movie?

1443
01:27:57,578 --> 01:27:59,781
No, I don't want to see a movie.

1444
01:27:59,814 --> 01:28:01,381
Mikey, you wanna go see a movie?

1445
01:28:24,839 --> 01:28:26,541
Harvard costs a lot of money

1446
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:29,811
and I'm not sending you
halfway across the country

1447
01:28:29,844 --> 01:28:31,679
if that's how
you're gonna behave.

1448
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:38,019
I already told you I
don't want to go to Harvard.

1449
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:42,690
All schools cost a lot of money.

1450
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:44,892
Then I'll apply
for financial aid.

1451
01:28:44,926 --> 01:28:46,561
- It won't be enough.
- I'll get a job.

1452
01:28:52,033 --> 01:28:54,135
Then I'll take a gap year,

1453
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:55,570
and I'll figure this out.

1454
01:28:55,603 --> 01:28:57,437
[Jack] Where are you gonna live?

1455
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:58,873
How are you gonna
support yourself?

1456
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:02,944
You can't choose my path for me.

1457
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:12,053
So you expect me to pay
for all of your choices,

1458
01:29:12,086 --> 01:29:13,888
like the choice you
made last night?

1459
01:29:18,926 --> 01:29:20,795
You could have been
severely injured.

1460
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:27,134
And you put your mother
and me through hell.

1461
01:29:36,978 --> 01:29:38,411
It won't happen again.

1462
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:47,989
I love you.

1463
01:29:56,197 --> 01:29:57,899
I love you, too.

1464
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:13,480
Could you pass me the syrup?

1465
01:30:31,232 --> 01:30:34,035
(Jenny sighs)

1466
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:37,104
Can't believe I did
something that crazy.

1467
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:43,010
Maybe you should just stick
to other forms of escape.

1468
01:30:52,119 --> 01:30:54,088
I just don't know what to do.

1469
01:30:55,823 --> 01:30:58,059
My parents have
spent a lot of money

1470
01:30:58,092 --> 01:31:02,163
trying to help me,
give me the best.

1471
01:31:05,599 --> 01:31:09,770
In middle school I even spent
some time in an institution.

1472
01:31:12,073 --> 01:31:12,974
What, why?

1473
01:31:13,007 --> 01:31:14,608
I'm better now.

1474
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:16,711
Functional, the doctors say.

1475
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:21,983
I pass my classes, I ace
my standardized tests,

1476
01:31:22,016 --> 01:31:24,719
haven't gotten arrested,
play nice with others.

1477
01:31:29,056 --> 01:31:31,559
So I made a deal
with my parents,

1478
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,062
as long as I'm not
slitting my wrists

1479
01:31:35,096 --> 01:31:37,965
or jumping off bridges,
they let me be.

1480
01:31:43,037 --> 01:31:45,239
How can you be that honest?

1481
01:31:51,746 --> 01:31:53,080
I'm a terrible Riot Grrrl.

1482
01:31:53,114 --> 01:31:54,115
(both laughing)

1483
01:31:54,148 --> 01:31:55,249
What?

1484
01:31:55,282 --> 01:31:56,817
I thought you were pretty-

1485
01:31:56,851 --> 01:31:58,919
[Jenny] I wish I had
some big revelation

1486
01:32:01,322 --> 01:32:02,757
and figured it all out.

1487
01:32:04,592 --> 01:32:08,162
♪ Pushing forward,
not looking back ♪

1488
01:32:08,195 --> 01:32:12,099
It felt like defeat and
triumph wrapped in one.

1489
01:32:13,267 --> 01:32:16,904
♪ Not looking back,
I had your back ♪

1490
01:32:16,937 --> 01:32:18,039
♪ You stabbed my back ♪

1491
01:32:18,072 --> 01:32:21,809

♪ Underneath your bed ♪

1495
01:32:30,384 --> 01:32:32,219
I'm trying real
hard to understand

1496
01:32:32,253 --> 01:32:33,788
what's going on
with you right now.

1497
01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:39,727
Everybody knows
what they want to do.

1498
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:41,295
What they want.

1499
01:32:42,863 --> 01:32:44,131
Kelly's going to Spelman.

1500
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,233
Owen doesn't fucking care

1501
01:32:46,267 --> 01:32:48,702
but he's gonna end up at
some Ivy League think tank.

1502
01:32:48,736 --> 01:32:50,171
I mean, even you
know what you want.

1503
01:32:50,204 --> 01:32:51,205
Don't be a bitch.

1504
01:32:54,008 --> 01:32:56,177
You have everything you
could ever fucking want.

1505
01:33:02,883 --> 01:33:03,717
Fuck.

1506
01:33:04,385 --> 01:33:06,120
I'm worried about you.

1507
01:33:14,929 --> 01:33:16,030
Yeah, I don't
think I'll be doing

1508
01:33:16,063 --> 01:33:17,832
anything like that anytime soon.

1509
01:33:23,838 --> 01:33:26,340
Silly rabbit,
trips are for kids.

1510
01:33:27,942 --> 01:33:30,144
(both chuckle)

1511
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:37,718
Will you still be my best
friend when we're real adults?

1512
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:38,352
Always.

1513
01:33:43,357 --> 01:33:45,359
Congratulations.

1514
01:33:45,392 --> 01:33:47,128
Early decision, Harvard.

1515
01:33:47,161 --> 01:33:48,395
It's not binding,

1516
01:33:48,429 --> 01:33:50,197
so I can still apply
and decide in April.

1517
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:52,299
It's frowned upon.

1518
01:33:54,201 --> 01:33:56,036
It's the best I
can do right now.

1519
01:33:57,438 --> 01:34:00,174
Nice work on the
literary magazine.

1520
01:34:00,207 --> 01:34:02,009
They're a little unpolished.

1521
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:03,377
I thought that was the point.

1522
01:34:07,781 --> 01:34:10,885
"If it be now, 'tis not to come.

1523
01:34:10,918 --> 01:34:13,787
If it be not to
come, it will be now.

1524
01:34:13,821 --> 01:34:17,958
If it be not now, yet it will
come, the readiness is all.

1525
01:34:17,992 --> 01:34:20,194
Since no man of aught
he leaves knows,

1526
01:34:20,227 --> 01:34:21,862
what is it to leave betimes?"

1527
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:24,365
Let be.

1528
01:34:27,301 --> 01:34:28,435
This is awesome.

1529
01:34:31,772 --> 01:34:32,406
Thank you.

1530
01:34:34,074 --> 01:34:35,309
[Rehnquist] Governor, are
you ready to take the oath?

1531
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:36,977
[Clinton] I am.

1532
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:39,413
Will you please raise your
right hand and repeat after me?

1533
01:34:40,915 --> 01:34:42,149
I, William Jefferson Clinton...

1534
01:34:42,183 --> 01:34:44,084
[Jenny] I wish I could
say everything changed,

1535
01:34:45,219 --> 01:34:47,121
that everything
was better, fixed.

1536
01:34:50,391 --> 01:34:51,792
But the truth is...

1537
01:34:53,928 --> 01:34:54,929
Complicated.

1538
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:59,266
Though we march to
the music of our time,

1539
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:02,937
our mission is timeless.

1540
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:05,339
Each generation of Americans

1541
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:08,709
must define what
it means to be...

1542
01:35:10,411 --> 01:35:12,880
[Jenny] Maybe I'm
remembering this all wrong.

1543
01:35:13,981 --> 01:35:15,382
Maybe I'm missing the point.

1544
01:35:19,019 --> 01:35:21,155
But all of these moments
are frozen in my memory

1545
01:35:21,188 --> 01:35:23,390
