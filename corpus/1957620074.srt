00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,371
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,406
(soft music)

3
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,468
- Wayne, I have something to tell you.

4
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,169
- What, Sarah?

5
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,139
- We're going to have a baby.

6
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,641
(soft music)

7
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,358
(soft music)

8
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,111
(dramatic music)

9
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,655
- The baby's asleep.

10
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,491
- Good.

11
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,360
- Would you like something to eat, son?

12
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,628
- No, thanks, ma.

13
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,030
Why don't you and dad go home and get some sleep.

14
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,531
- Well, we're going to spend the night again

15
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,300
and help you with the baby.

16
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,470
- You both need your rest been up for days.

17
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,272
Pam and I will be fine.

18
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,173
- It's no problem for us to stay.

19
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,809
- I know, dad, but we'll be fine.

20
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,611
Ma, I'll see you in the morning.

21
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,548
Dad, I'll be coming back to work tomorrow.

22
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,385
(dramatic music)

23
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,218
(soft music)

24
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,307
(soft music)

25
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,928
(telephone ringing)

26
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,835
- Afternoon, Christian Film Library.

27
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,237
Hey, Harry, how you doing?

28
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,139
Doing fine, fine.

29
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,674
The convention

30
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,810
well, no, I won't be going this year.

31
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,545
Well, the doc asked me to take it easy,

32
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,013
you know, no traveling.

33
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,783
My old tickers slowing down a little bit, Harry.

34
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,785
Wayne well I'm not sure.

35
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,154
He hasn't decided yet.

36
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,922
- I know I need to go.

37
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,357
I just don't wanna leave Pamela.

38
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,259
- Hey, your mother and I will take care of her.

39
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,894
You have nothing to worry about.

40
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,696
- I'm not worried, dad.

41
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,131
- Well, what is it then, son?

42
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,235
- When Pamela was born I made a commitment to the Lord

43
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,136
that I'd pray with her every night,

44
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,439
so far I've been able to keep that commitment.

45
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,375
If I go to the convention, I don't see how I can.

46
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,209
- I see.

47
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,646
Well, I'll pray with her that won't be a problem.

48
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,947
- It's not that, dad.

49
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,682
Just that I made the commitment,

50
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,118
and I don't wanna break it.

51
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,520
- Son, the film convention's very important.

52
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,955
You really need to go.

53
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,123
- I know, dad.

54
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,326
I just wanna do the right thing.

55
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,995
- Wait a minute, Wayne

56
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,663
I've got an idea.

57
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,733
I think I know how you can do both.

58
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,235
(soft music)

59
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,343
- Master, what is the greatest commandment?

60
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,345
Jesus answered and said,

61
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,647
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God

62
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,750
"with all thy heart, with all thy soul

63
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,652
"and with all thy mind.

64
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,756
"This is the first and great commandment", right?

65
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,590
- Right.

66
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,098
Daddy, I have Jesus in my heart.

67
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,436
- Where's your heart, Pamela?

68
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,503
- Right here.

69
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,980
♪ Happy birthday to you

70
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,283
♪ Happy birthday to you

71
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:21,520
♪ Happy birthday dear Pamela

72
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,857
♪ Happy birthday to you

73
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,493
(family applauding)

74
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,497
- [Wayne] Say I prayer and blow out the candles.

75
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,140
- What'd you pray for, honey?

76
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,609
- Well, now she's not supposed to tell ya that.

77
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,811
That's a secret between her and the Lord.

78
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,680
- He's right, ma, sorry.

79
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,181
What'd you pray for, Pamela?

80
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,282
- Dad,

81
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,550
(family laughing)

82
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,053
I'm not supposed to tell you, but I will.

83
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,354
I didn't ask for anything.

84
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,823
I just told God how much I loved my grandparents

85
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,458
and my father.

86
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,228
- Now isn't that nice?

87
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,931
- Lord, thank you for our family and for this special day.

88
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,600
Continue to guide us and teach us

89
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,036
through your word and your Spirit.

90
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,139
In your Son's precious name, amen.

91
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,341
- Amen, thanks, dad.

92
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,243
- You're welcome good night.

93
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,310
- Night, dad.

94
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,216
- 16 years old.

95
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,589
You're becoming a beautiful young woman

96
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,358
just like your mother.

97
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,893
(soft music)

98
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,827
Good night.

99
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,169
(students talking loudly)

100
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,237
- Hey, why don't you take Mitzy?

101
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,039
- [Jerry] Nah, we're just friends.

102
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,275
Besides I went with her last year.

103
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,676
- You've been out with every Christian girl

104
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,777
in this world haven't you, Jerry?

105
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:52,878
(Jerry laughing)

106
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,380
- Not quite, Andy.

107
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,054
I haven't been out with Pamela Bucklin yet.

108
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,523
- Nobody's been out with her.

109
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,324
- Nobody?

110
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,728
- She's sweet 16 and never been kissed.

111
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,466
- Never.

112
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,604
- Jerry Clark asked me out for a date today?

113
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,872
- What'd you tell him?

114
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,607
- I told him I had to ask my father.

115
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,642
- Yeah, you know how I feel about dating.

116
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,411
- He just wants me to go to the game with him.

117
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,947
It's not really a date.

118
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,348
He's a good Christian guy, dad

119
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,318
probably the best Christian in the whole school.

120
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,921
(students talking loudly)

121
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,199
- Hey, how you doing?

122
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,734
- Hi, Jerry.

123
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,936
- So what's the good news we gonna go to the game?

124
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,872
- Jerry, I think you're a great guy and everything,

125
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,874
but I can't go with you.

126
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,010
- Well, why not?

127
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,745
- My father won't let me.

128
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,280
- What do you mean your father won't let you?

129
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,815
I'm not asking you to marry me.

130
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,750
I just want you to go to the game.

131
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,584
- I know.

132
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,487
I'm sorry I can't go.

133
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,923
- Look you said I was a great guy.

134
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,525
Butter up your dad a little.

135
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,592
- I can't.

136
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,728
He won't change his mind.

137
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,630
- Alright I get it.

138
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,198
I'm just not good enough for you.

139
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,200
- No, Jerry, that's not it at all.

140
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,638
My father won't let me go out with anybody I'm sorry.

141
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,439
- You don't have to make any excuses.

142
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,941
I get the picture.

143
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,148
- Are you crazy?

144
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,950
I'd die if he asked me out.

145
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,418
I can't believe you said no.

146
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,352
- My father won't let me.

147
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,954
What else was I supposed to say?

148
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,389
- What's wrong with your dad, Pam?

149
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,357
He won't let you go out with anybody.

150
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,259
My father let's me go out with whoever I want

151
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,694
as long as he's a Christian.

152
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,129
- Well, he wants me to wait for the Lord

153
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,630
to bring the right guy along.

154
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,566
- But how are you supposed to know who the right guy is

155
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,135
if you never go out with anybody?

156
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,770
- How am I supposed to know who the right guy is

157
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,572
if I never go out with anybody?

158
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,173
- Pamela, who've you been talking to?

159
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,341
- Doesn't make sense, dad.

160
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,642
I don't see why I can't go out with a guy.

161
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,877
Nothing's gonna happen.

162
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,912
- I've told you why I don't want you to date.

163
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,581
- Dad, I'm wanna get married someday.

164
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,649
I don't wanna be single my whole life.

165
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,552
- (laughing) You just turned 16.

166
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,854
You'll probably be married before any of your girlfriends.

167
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,889
- I doubt it.

168
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,490
- Look I know it's hard.

169
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,693
All your friends are dating and you're not,

170
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,630
but it's for your own protection just trust me.

171
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,335
- So what kind of a guy does your dad want you to marry?

172
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,904
- He wants me to marry a guy who's never kissed a girl.

173
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,405
- He what?

174
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,940
- He wants me to marry a guy who's never kissed a girl.

175
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,908
- You're kidding.

176
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,409
- Nope.

177
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,278
- Pam, your dad wants you to marry a guy who doesn't exist.

178
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,946
- He thinks he does.

179
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,515
- So why won't he let you date?

180
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,251
- He wants me to remain pure.

181
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,086
He doesn't want me to be tempted to kiss anyone

182
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,520
until my wedding day.

183
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,422
- Wait a minute your dad wants you to wait

184
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,091
until your wedding day to kiss a guy,

185
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,325
and he wants your husband to wait

186
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,727
until his wedding day to kiss a girl.

187
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,995
- That's right.

188
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,063
Jessica, please don't repeat that to anyone.

189
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,099
Everybody thinks I'm weird enough as it is.

190
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,568
- Don't worry I won't.

191
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,969
Pam, I like your dad and everything

192
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,605
but he's living in a dream world.

193
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,773
What's his thing about kissing?

194
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,808
I've kissed guys before and I feel bad.

195
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,911
Kissing's fun you're really missing out.

196
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,980
- Jessica's father lets her go out with guys

197
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,682
as long as they're Christians.

198
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:20,319
- I wonder what Jessica's husband would say if he knew that?

199
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,154
- What do you mean?

200
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,890
- Pamela, whenever we come to a point in our lives

201
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,558
when we're not sure what to do,

202
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,960
we should always look ahead

203
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,195
and view things from that perspective.

204
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,698
For example, in your case about dating

205
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,767
let's look ahead to your wedding day.

206
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,001
You'll be getting married to the

207
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,037
man you love with all your heart.

208
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,171
This is the man you're going to spend

209
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,640
the rest of your life with.

210
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,978
Now let's go ahead a little further to your wedding night.

211
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,380
When you lie down on your wedding bed,

212
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,250
what kind of a man do you want your husband to be?

213
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,486
Do you wanna man who saved all his love just for you

214
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,755
one who never even kissed another woman

215
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,391
so he could share that just with you,

216
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,361
or do you want a man who's been with other women before

217
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,597
one who kissed other women and didn't wait for you?

218
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,667
Which one would you prefer?

219
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,603
- I prefer the one who waited.

220
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,939
- And so would your husband.

221
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,844
- Hi, Pam.

222
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,079
- Hi, Jerry. - How you doing?

223
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,014
- I'm doing okay.

224
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,248
- The game's tomorrow night,

225
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,350
and I'm still not going with anybody.

226
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,051
Did your father change his mind?

227
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,187
- No, he didn't sorry.

228
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,688
- I'd really like to go with you.

229
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,424
Maybe we could meet and sit together just as friends?

230
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,328
- I'd like that, Jerry, I really would but I can't.

231
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,529
- You know I think it's great and all

232
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,432
you respect your father I really do,

233
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,168
but you're not a little girl anymore.

234
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,002
See ya.

235
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,108
(dramatic music)

236
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,333
(dramatic music)

237
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,387
- Hi, Pam. - Hi.

238
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,928
- Lots of kids are laughing at me

239
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,164
because of your old fashioned ways.

240
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,332
- There's nothing old fashioned about purity.

241
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,301
- You can't show me one verse in the bible

242
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,336
where it says it's wrong to date.

243
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,905
- Pamela, what's gotten into you?

244
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,707
- Nothing it's just I'm not a little girl anymore.

245
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,076
- I know that, but I'm still your father

246
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,079
and I'm responsible for your well being.

247
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,747
- You don't trust me that's what it is.

248
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,848
You don't trust me.

249
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,616
- I trust you very much.

250
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,952
- Then why won't you let me go to the game with Jerry?

251
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,221
- Because it's against my better judgment.

252
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,923
- But you're making my life miserable, dad.

253
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,091
Don't you see that you're making it miserable?

254
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:13,926
- Pamela,

255
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,861
Pamela.

256
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,630
(door slamming)

257
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,779
(soft knocking)

258
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,613
Pamela,

259
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,149
(soft knocking)

260
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,017
Pamela, may I come in it's time to pray?

261
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,488
- I've already said my prayers good night.

262
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,689
- [Wayne] I've prayed with you every night

263
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,857
since the day you were born.

264
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,791
- Good night.

265
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,626
- Pamela. - Good night.

266
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,900
- [Wayne] Dear Lord, we love you.

267
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,004
Thank you for this day.

268
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,039
Please watch over Pamela.

269
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,878
Help me to be the father you want me to be

270
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,546
in Jesus' name amen.

271
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,384
Good night, Pamela.

272
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,832
(dramatic music)

273
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:56,261
(telephone ringing)

274
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,732
Christian Film Library this is Wayne.

275
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,800
- Hey, dad.

276
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,435
- Pamela, hi.

277
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,803
- Dad, I'm going to the game a little early tonight

278
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,138
so I won't be home for supper.

279
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,173
I've got yours ready though it's in the oven.

280
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,241
- Alright thanks.

281
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,542
Who you going with?

282
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,744
- I'm going with Jessica.

283
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,813
- Okay, be home on time.

284
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,049
- I will, dad, love ya bye.

285
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:18,817
- Bye.

286
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,395
(crowd screaming)

287
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,234
(cheerleaders cheering)

288
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,548
(crowd chanting)

289
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,384
(dramatic music)

290
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,897
- I'd better go on from here.

291
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,365
- Is everything okay?

292
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:44,069
- Yeah, it's just my dad he's a little over protective.

293
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,371
You understand? - Yeah.

294
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,775
But what's your hurry it's not very late.

295
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,845
(tense music)

296
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,765
(tense music)

297
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,642
- Sorry I'm late.

298
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,882
(students talking loudly)

299
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,289
- So how was it?

300
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,025
- Jessica, why is everybody looking at me?

301
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,393
- Probably because the whole school knows

302
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,695
about you and Jerry?

303
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,729
So what'd you think of kissing?

304
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,630
Did you like it?

305
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,664
- I didn't kiss him.

306
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,532
- That's not what I heard.

307
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,933
- What did you hear?

308
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,201
- Well, I heard that you and Jerry

309
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,870
made out for a while in the living room.

310
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,871
- That's not true.

311
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,339
Who'd you hear that from?

312
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,508
- Well, Mitzy told me and she heard it from Andy

313
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,576
and he probably heard it from Jerry.

314
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,811
- Jerry's lying.

315
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,446
He tried to kiss me but I didn't let him.

316
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,748
He didn't even come into my house.

317
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,184
- That's not what's going around.

318
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,354
- So Jerry told everyone he kissed you.

319
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,157
- He didn't, dad, why is he saying that?

320
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,525
- Well, first of all

321
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,060
maybe the Lord's trying to teach you a lesson.

322
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,463
If had obeyed your father, none of this would've happened.

323
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,297
- I know.

324
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,866
- You also deceived me.

325
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,768
You said you were going to the game with Jessica

326
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,471
which you did but you met Jerry there.

327
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,740
Now Jerry's telling everyone he went out with you

328
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,043
which he did but what happened is another story.

329
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,711
- I don't know why I did it.

330
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,915
All the other girls were going on dates and I wasn't.

331
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,518
- Pamela, I would never ever do anything to hurt you.

332
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,187
I love you.

333
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,522
- I know, dad, and I'm really sorry.

334
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,758
I'll never do anything like this again.

335
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,259
Please forgive me.

336
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,762
- I forgive you.

337
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,665
- I love you, dad.

338
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,899
- Love you too.

339
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,671
Pamela, a kiss is something you shouldn't just give away.

340
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,673
It's very special.

341
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,741
What does the minister say just after he's

342
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,977
pronounced the couple husband and wife?

343
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,980
He says, "You may now kiss bride."

344
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,485
Please keep out any root of bitterness

345
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,753
from springing up in our hearts.

346
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,722
Help us not to be angry.

347
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,426
We pray for Jerry and ask that you would work in his life.

348
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,462
Thank you for what you're teaching us in this situation

349
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,130
in Jesus' name amen.

350
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,499
- Amen.

351
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,734
Thanks, dad.

352
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,269
- Your welcome.

353
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,640
- Dad, I never thought Jerry would spread a lie about me.

354
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,375
- People lie to cover themselves.

355
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,143
Maybe Jerry did some bragging to his buddies,

356
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,814
and now he has to live up to it by lying I don't know.

357
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,950
- What can I do everybody thinks I did something I didn't?

358
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,886
- You could transfer to another school.

359
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,720
- I wish.

360
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,057
- Or you could do what Jesus did.

361
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,826
Remember when he stood in front of Pilate

362
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,494
and they falsely accused him?

363
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,429
He didn't say anything.

364
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,399
Jesus didn't defend himself against the lies,

365
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,268
and Pilate was amazed.

366
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,769
You know why?

367
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,338
Because he saw the humble reaction of Christ,

368
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,741
and it showed him who was really lying.

369
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,309
Well, you could do the same.

370
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,846
Don't say anything, don't defend yourself, don't get upset.

371
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,948
Just be patient and let the Lord

372
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,450
have control of the situation.

373
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,809
- [Andy] Hi, Pam.

374
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:18,710
- Hi, Andy.

375
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,279
- Pam, I was just wondering

376
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,149
if you'd like to go to the game with me this Friday night?

377
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,351
- No, I can't thanks anyway.

378
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,919
- Are you going out with Jerry again?

379
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,090
- No, I'm not going out with Jerry and he didn't...

380
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,496
No, I'm not going out with anybody.

381
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,333
(dramatic music)

382
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,064
- But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,

383
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,166
concerning them which are asleep.

384
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,571
That ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope.

385
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,440
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

386
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,210
even so them also which sleep in Jesus

387
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,545
will God bring with him.

388
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,448
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord

389
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,017
that we which are alive and remain

390
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,685
until the coming of the Lord

391
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,488
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

392
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,724
For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout

393
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:43,862
with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God.

394
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,898
The dead in Christ shall rise first.

395
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,667
Then we which are alive and remain

396
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,703
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

397
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,972
to meet the Lord in the air

398
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,841
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

399
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,712
Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

400
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,287
(students speaking loudly)

401
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,333
Do you know what a Christian Film Library is, Fredric?

402
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,270
- It's got something to do with Christian films, right?

403
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,504
- Right.

404
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,773
We distribute films to churches, schools,

405
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:32,110
and other groups interested in spreading the gospel.

406
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,713
My father started the library back in 1945

407
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:39,250
but he just went to be with the Lord last month.

408
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,552
Pamela's been coming in after school

409
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,253
helping with the book work.

410
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,290
Now I need someone back here to help with the films.

411
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,058
The job would be every day after school

412
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,626
for about three hours.

413
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,994
Would that work in your schedule?

414
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,863
- Yes, sir that'd be good.

415
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,364
- All right.

416
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,467
Well, why don't you tell me something about yourself.

417
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,068
Pamela says you're new in school.

418
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,236
- That's right, sir, we just moved here

419
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,105
this summer from Seattle.

420
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,107
Let's see I'm a senior,

421
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,009
and I became a Christian when I was nine years old.

422
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,578
I've been wanting to work in a ministry,

423
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,113
and when I saw your sign at school,

424
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,048
it looked like a good opportunity.

425
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,883
I don't know much about film libraries,

426
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,284
but I'm willing to learn.

427
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,519
Promise to work real hard

428
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,955
and try to do the best job I can.

429
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,525
- You think you'd like to work here, Fredric?

430
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,194
- Yes, I'd like to give it a try.

431
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,697
(soft music)

432
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,812
- Ready to watch the film?

433
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,881
- Nah, I don't feel like it tonight.

434
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:20,218
- It's a new release just came in today.

435
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,855
Where's Jessica tonight?

436
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,424
- She's out with her boyfriend.

437
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,227
- Should be a great film.

438
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,896
Why don't you watch it with me?

439
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:32,964
- No, thanks.

440
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,187
- Hi, Jessica, come on in.

441
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,689
- Hi, Mr. Bucklin.

442
00:30:58,856 --> 00:30:59,824
Is Pam home?

443
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:00,692
- Yeah, she's up in her room.

444
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,526
- Thanks.

445
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,029
- Jessica, are you alright?

446
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,864
- Yeah.

447
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,469
(dramatic music)

448
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,104
Last night we went out for pizza

449
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,673
and then we took a drive.

450
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,010
We stopped and parked and then we made out

451
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,712
and it was great.

452
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,915
(dramatic music)

453
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,517
Then he said our relationship had reached a turning point

454
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,688
and that if we really loved each other we should...

455
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,892
I can't believe it happened.

456
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,895
If I would've said no,

457
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:41,499
he would've thought that I didn't love him.

458
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,540
I should've known better after what he did to you.

459
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,245
I feel so guilty.

460
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,849
What am I gonna do?

461
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,199
- Dad,

462
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,003
I need to talk to you about something.

463
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,738
- What is it, Pamela?

464
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,341
Pamela.

465
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,445
- Something bad happened to Jessica last night.

466
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,780
- What happened?

467
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,283
Pamela.

468
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,818
- She just wanted Jerry to love her dad.

469
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,920
She didn't mean for anything to happen.

470
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,323
- What are you talking about?

471
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,291
- Jessica

472
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,963
went out with her boyfriend.

473
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,636
(dramatic music)

474
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,187
She came to me for help today,

475
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,323
but I didn't know what to say.

476
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,525
She feels so guilty.

477
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,694
She won't forgive herself.

478
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,931
What can I tell her?

479
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,368
Dad, what can I tell her?

480
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,940
- The Pharisees brought a woman

481
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,910
caught in the act of adultery to Jesus.

482
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,514
They said, "The law of Moses says to stone her.

483
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,483
"What do you say?"

484
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,152
Jesus knew what they were up to.

485
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,821
He said, "He who is without sin

486
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,557
"let him cast the first stone."

487
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:50,862
One by one they all left just the woman remained.

488
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,764
Jesus said to her,

489
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,832
"Did anyone condemn you?"

490
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,201
She said, "No one, Lord."

491
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,203
He said, "Neither do I",

492
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,775
but then he gave her a command.

493
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,145
- "Go and sin no more."

494
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,318
- Be with Jessica tonight, Lord

495
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,154
comfort her, heal her,

496
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,124
draw her close to you

497
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,793
in Jesus' name amen.

498
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,896
- Amen.

499
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,830
Thanks, dad.

500
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,698
- You're welcome good night.

501
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:28,699
- Night dad.

502
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:33,905
- Pamela,

503
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,174
- Yes, dad.

504
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,643
- You mentioned a boy's name tonight, Jerry

505
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,778
is that Jerry Clark?

506
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,712
- Yes, dad.

507
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,283
- Good night.

508
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,085
- Night.

509
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,392
- Our records show it went out on Monday, John.

510
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,128
It should've been there the next day.

511
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,831
Yes, but I can't run a tracer at 6:00 p.m. on Friday.

512
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,533
You needed to call me earlier at least yesterday

513
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:06,237
then I could've gotten another one to you.

514
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:10,708
Not unless you can come down and pick one up.

515
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,477
I'm very sorry, John.

516
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,545
Right.

517
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,715
- What happened Mr. Bucklin?

518
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,218
- Faith Community didn't get their film for tonight.

519
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,386
They're having a big youth rally that starts at eight.

520
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,255
It's about two hours from here.

521
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,090
- I know I shipped it out on Monday.

522
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,859
- It's not your fault, Fredric.

523
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,495
Every once in a while something like this happens.

524
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,930
I do whatever I can to go the films there

525
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,099
but there's not much I can do about it tonight.

526
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,567
It's my mother's birthday.

527
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,069
Pamela's cooking a big dinner.

528
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,837
In fact I'm late now.

529
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,142
- Well, I'm really sorry about the film, sir.

530
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,510
- Yeah, I am too.

531
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,844
Look do you mind locking up for me?

532
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,112
- No, not at all.

533
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:48,946
- I'll be through in about five minutes.

534
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:49,780
- Thanks.

535
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,183
Have a good weekend, Fredric.

536
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,417
- You too, sir

537
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,253
and tell your mother happy birthday for me.

538
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,821
- Thank you I will.

539
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,206
(soft music)

540
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,562
I got a call this morning from the pastor at

541
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,863
Faith Community.

542
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,199
He said you got the film there just in time.

543
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,001
He was very thankful.

544
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,803
That's a great thing you did, Fredric

545
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,471
but you didn't have to.

546
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,706
- I wanted to.

547
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,240
- Well, thank you very much.

548
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,475
- You're welcome.

549
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,977
- I'll be sure to pay you for the extra hours.

550
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:29,513
- No, Mr. Bucklin, that's not why I did it.

551
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,083
- I know but I want to.

552
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,718
- Thanks.

553
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,853
- Pastor said four kids made a profession of faith

554
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,688
after seeing the film.

555
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,522
- Yeah.

556
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,503
(soft music)

557
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,330
- Fredric, hi. - Hi, Mr. Bucklin,

558
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,264
how are ya?

559
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,900
I'm sorry to come over so unexpected,

560
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,336
but I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute?

561
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,305
Mr. Bucklin, I'd like to start working full time

562
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,408
at the library trying to help more with the ministry.

563
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,244
I really feel like this is what the Lord wants me to do.

564
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,479
I talked it over with my parents,

565
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,548
but I know you have the final word.

566
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,049
Just wanted to let you know.

567
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,185
- Well, this comes as a surprise.

568
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,686
I was thinking that with you graduating

569
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,822
I'd be losing you at the end of the summer.

570
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,824
Now you wanna stay on full time.

571
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,258
- If you need time to think about it,

572
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,860
pray about it I understand.

573
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,361
- Nah, I don't need any time.

574
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:28,065
Starting Monday you're a full time employee.

575
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,467
- Really, sir.

576
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,935
- Really, sir.

577
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,703
- Well, thank you, thank you very much.

578
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,704
- Thank you.

579
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,941
- There is one other thing.

580
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,076
I was going to take a ride over to the rock formations,

581
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,645
and if it's okay with you and okay with Pamela

582
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,316
I was wondering if she'd like to come along?

583
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,720
(soft music)

584
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,310
- My grandfather used to bring my dad up here a lot

585
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,246
when he was a little boy.

586
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,149
He said that this was a good praying spot.

587
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,784
He said that God cut a little hole in the rock

588
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,419
so you could look up to Heaven.

589
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,188
This is where my dad proposed to my mom.

590
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,623
- Oh, yeah.

591
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,358
- This is also where my mom told my dad

592
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,060
she was gonna have a baby, me.

593
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,195
- Pretty special place, huh?

594
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,029
- Yeah.

595
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,800
- I'm really sorry about you mother.

596
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,636
- My parents were both in their 30s when they got married.

597
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,937
My mom was working at a church,

598
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,839
and she was returning a film to the library

599
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,308
that's how they met.

600
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,278
- Pamela, if it's not too personal

601
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,313
how did your mother die?

602
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,781
- She died the day I was born

603
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,317
from something called amniotic fluid embolism.

604
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,019
It's kind of complicated to explain.

605
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,687
It's pretty rare.

606
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,088
- I'm really sorry.

607
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,891
It must've been tough on your dad.

608
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,326
You'll both see her in Heaven one day.

609
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,160
- Yeah.

610
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,297
- Hey, thanks for coming with me today.

611
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,265
I hope I didn't put you on the spot back at your house.

612
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,601
- No, not at all this has been nice.

613
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,037
I've really enjoyed myself.

614
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,539
(soft music)

615
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,302
(soft music)

616
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,028
(soft music)

617
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:49,133
("O Come All Ye Faithful")

618
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,399
(soft knocking)

619
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:26,537
- Fredric, hi.

620
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,638
- Hi, Mr. Bucklin, how are you?

621
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:28,539
- Fine, how you doing?

622
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,740
- Good thanks.

623
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,141
Hey, the house looks good.

624
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,242
- Thanks.

625
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,411
Pamela's been decorating all afternoon.

626
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,613
In fact I think she's upstairs putting some

627
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:39,450
finishing touches on Christmas tree ornaments she made.

628
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,085
Pamela, Fredric's here.

629
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,455
- [Pamela] Okay, I'll be down in a few minutes.

630
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,123
- Do you wanna help decorate tree?

631
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,324
- [Fredric] Sure.

632
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:48,559
- You can start with some of these ornaments

633
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,694
Pamela made and put them on first.

634
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,996
Try to find the best spots.

635
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,999
(Fredric chuckles)

636
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,507
- Mr. Bucklin, there's something I'd like to ask you.

637
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:04,908
- [Wayne] Sure.

638
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,511
- Mr. Bucklin, I'd like to ask you

639
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,014
for your permission to marry to Pamela.

640
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,682
I love her very much, sir

641
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,318
and I know she's the one the Lord has for me.

642
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,688
- How do you know that, Fredric?

643
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,591
- Well, when I was younger I told the Lord

644
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,594
that I wanted to marry the girl that he wanted me to

645
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,262
so I promised him that I wouldn't kiss a girl

646
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,897
until my wedding day.

647
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,166
If I did that if I waited,

648
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,634
he'd show me who the right girl was

649
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,704
by bringing me someone who did the same thing.

650
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,873
I know Pamela's that girl.

651
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,285
- Hi.

652
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,420
- Hi. - How are you?

653
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,088
- Good, How are you? - Fine.

654
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,289
- Decorations are really nice.

655
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,124
- Thanks I'm not quite done yet.

656
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,961
I still have a few more things I wanna put up.

657
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,138
- Pamela, I was just talking with your father and

658
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,111
I love you very much and I want you to be my wife.

659
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,781
("O Come All Ye Faithful")

660
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:21,885
Pamela,

661
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,523
will you marry me?

662
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,125
- Yes, I'd love to.

663
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:30,794
- Bless you.

664
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:31,962
God bless you.

665
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,231
I love you both.

666
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,067
- Thanks, dad.

667
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,168
- Congratulations.

668
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,169
- Thank you.

669
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,644
- [Minister] Okay.

670
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,179
Okay, now turn and take his arm

671
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,414
and pause for just a moment.

672
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,649
(minister mumbling)

673
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,418
(Pamela laughing)

674
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,687
Then slowly proceed out.

675
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,823
You two stay here until they get all the way out.

676
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,259
Okay, no need to go any further thank you.

677
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,093
Very nice.

678
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,369
- [Bestman] Hey, is there anything I can do for ya?

679
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,837
- Yeah, could you run to the car

680
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,706
and get those papers they really signed tonight.

681
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,374
- Okay. - Thank you.

682
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,410
- How you doing? - Good.

683
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,212
I feel like the most blessed man on Earth.

684
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,414
- That's how I felt the night before I got married.

685
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,850
I had so much joy in my heart I couldn't contain myself.

686
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,519
- That's about how I feel now.

687
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,121
- I'm very grateful for who you are, Fredric.

688
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,224
I love you like a son, and I trust you.

689
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,493
I know you'll take very good care of my daughter.

690
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,061
- Thank you I will.

691
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,531
- You know Sarah and I were married

692
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,000
for two years before she died

693
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,870
but those two years have carried me the next 22.

694
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,672
I just wanna tell ya

695
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,141
love your wife with all your heart.

696
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,743
Cherish her.

697
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:56,180
You never know when the Lord will call one of you home.

698
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,181
- Thank you.

699
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,585
- May your presence, Lord, be very real for them

700
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,254
all the days of their lives.

701
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,590
Always keep them close to you

702
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,759
and close to your word.

703
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,695
In Jesus' precious name amen.

704
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,930
- Amen.

705
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,964
Thanks, dad.

706
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,499
- You're welcome.

707
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,836
- I'm gonna miss you praying for me every night.

708
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,637
I love you very, very much.

709
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,839
- I love you very, very much.

710
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,075
I've got something for you.

711
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,881
- It's the cross mom wore on her wedding day.

712
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,683
- I was hoping you'd wear it tomorrow.

713
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,284
- I will thank you.

714
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,639
- Good night.

715
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,142
- Night, dad.

716
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,578
(soft music)

717
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,792
- And as you have both come today

718
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,562
in the presence of God All Mighty

719
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,064
to commit yourselves one to another

720
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,335
and to the glory of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ

721
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:30,140
on this glorious day I say first to you, Fredric

722
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,577
do you take Pamela to be your lawful wedded wife

723
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,514
to love her, honor her, provide for her

724
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,718
and lead her always in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ?

725
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,552
- I do.

726
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,823
- Pamela, do you take Fredric to be your

727
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,059
lawful wedded husband

728
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,396
to love him, care for him, respect him,

729
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,332
and submit to his leadership

730
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,235
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ?

731
00:48:58,235 --> 00:48:59,069
- I do.

732
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,042
- As a sign of your love and faithfulness,

733
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,376
would you now exchange the rings

734
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,478
you have for one another?

735
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,083
(soft music)

736
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,209
By the authority of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ

737
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,411
and by the laws of the state

738
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,480
it gives me great joy to announce

739
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,151
that Fredric and Pamela are now husband and wife.

740
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,021
What therefore God hath joined together

741
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,790
let not man put asunder.

742
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,893
Fredric, you may now kiss your bride.

743
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,744
(soft music)

744
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,249
(soft music)

745
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,661
(soft music)

746
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,618
(telephone ringing)

747
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:09,653
- Hello.

748
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:10,554
- Hi, dad.

749
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,122
- Pamela, hello.

750
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,124
- I just wanted to give you a quick call.

751
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,059
- I'm surprised to hear from you.

752
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,361
- Well, I wanted to talk to you for a minute.

753
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,764
I knew you'd be going to bed soon.

754
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,800
Well, I just wanted to pray with you one more time.

755
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,834
- Okay.

756
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,469
If it's alright with Fredric.

757
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,837
- It is.

758
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,740
Dad, this time let me pray.

759
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,510
(soft music)

760
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,511
- All right.

761
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,681
- Are you ready?

762
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,218
- Ready.

763
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,993
- Dear Lord,

764
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:54,164
thank you so much for my daddy.

765
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,536
(soft music)

766
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,063
(soft music)
