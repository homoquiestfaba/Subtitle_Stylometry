1
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,980
Notice the elegance of the proof.
It’s beautiful!

2
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,350
It reminds me
of a quote from Socrates:

3
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,510
"If measure and symmetry are absent
from any composition. - 

4
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,750
- The ruin awaits both the
ingredients and the composition."

5
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,830
"Measure and symmetry are beauty
and virtue the world over."

6
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,470
- Do you think he’s straight?
- Yeah, he’s too boring to be gay.

7
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,980
- Is it 5: 15?
- Yes, it is.

8
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,670
Thank you...

9
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,350
I'm releasing you a half hour early
today. I have... an appointment.

10
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,350
I’m giving a lecture on my new book
tonight. You are all welcome.

11
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,350
Thank you.

12
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,150
Rose, get that mask off your face.
It’ll clog your pores.

13
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,390
You’re going to be late.
It’s almost seven o’clock.

14
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,110
You bum! Three million dollars
a year! For what?

15
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,150
Come on.
Just one more out.

16
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,070
- Barry Neufeld.
- Hi, it’s Rose.

17
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,670
Hi... Not again.

18
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,230
I think it’s an allergic reaction
to something I ate.

19
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,470
- My throat’s starting to close up.
- It sounds like you’re dying.

20
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,750
- Sure you’re not allergic to me?
- That’s a terrible thing to think!

21
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,670
Every Manhattan restaurant hates me
for not keeping reservations.

22
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,510
Why don’t you call me next week?
If you still want to.

23
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,270
- Feel better.
- Thank you. Bye.

24
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,910
- Should I start with a joke?
- No, there’s not enough time.

25
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,950
- For what?
- To develop a sense of humor.

26
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,270
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the author of "Absolute Truth". - 

27
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,110
- Columbia’s very own
Professor Gregory Larkin.

28
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,270
You’re going to be fine.

29
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,900
Thank you. I’m honored by this
warm and gracious welcome.

30
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,510
Being here, at the end of a journey,
I’m reminded of Descartes" words:

31
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:20,470
"Whether I am awake or asleep, two
and three will always make five."

32
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:26,870
"It does not seem possible that
such a truth can be questioned."

33
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,990
This book has taken me
over 14 years to write.

34
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,100
It is with sadness I say goodbye
to it consuming my days and nights.

35
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,950
And nights...

36
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,460
And as I stand here...

37
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,550
In coming up...
summing up...

38
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,350
Excuse me,
I’m feeling a little dizzy.

39
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,990
I thought it would feel differently.
I thought I'd know more. I don’t.

40
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,230
I don’t know anything, really.

41
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,870
Thank you all for coming.

42
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,110
What did I say?

43
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,980
It was fine, though you shouldn’t
work for a suicide hotline.

44
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:41,070
- You did fine until Candice came.
- Don’t start. I just forgot to eat.

45
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,390
It’s natural. She left you what,
a year ago?

46
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,740
Thank God Candy left when she did,
or I’d never have finished the book.

47
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,620
You’re a guy who can’t have sex
and chew gum at the same time.

48
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,510
When I’m with someone, I tend
to get a little sidetracked.

49
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,110
- 14 years? Is that sidetracked?
- I bet she’s still out there.

50
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,310
If I know Candice, she’s out there.

51
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,140
She’s out there.
Face her like a grown-up.

52
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,710
- Don’t let me go home with her.
- It would be odd not to invite...

53
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,710
Just don’t let me go home with her.

54
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,950
Are you all right?

55
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,220
- It was the stupid wine. Hello.
- You look great.

56
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:44,790
I hope you don’t mind me showing up
like this on your big night.

57
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,740
It’s just that I've been
thinking so much about you lately.

58
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,540
- Do you want to go get a drink?
- I’d better not.

59
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,310
- A bite to eat?
- No, I’m not hungry.

60
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,180
- Do you want me to take you home?
- Okay.

61
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,710
- Good to see you, Henry.
- But Greg...

62
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:15,110
- Don’t leave. Aren’t you staying?
- Well, we’re done.

63
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,950
- I still have feelings for you.
- But I dumped you for another man.

64
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,820
- And I'm still sort of with Paul.
- I thought that was over.

65
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,390
He cheated. I wanted to feel better
about myself before I see him.

66
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,310
- That’s why you’re here?
- Well, yeah.

67
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,230
You were always a nice guy.
But let’s face it. - 

68
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,790
- We’ve nothing in common except
sex, and the fact you idolize me.

69
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,190
I really do care for you.

70
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,910
- I just can’t wind up with you.
- Can I call you sometime?

71
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,230
What for?

72
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,230
- Are you going?
- No, I cancelled.

73
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,990
What do you want to do for dinner?
Make that pasta with artichokes.

74
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,830
Later we can figure out what to do
with your hair for Claire’s wedding.

75
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,830
What is this?

76
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,950
Look at that.

77
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,990
The mating ritual
is both speedy and violent.

78
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,510
The lesser male often covers
the larger female.

79
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,750
If unsuccessful in mounting, the
male is often eaten by the female.

80
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,270
We're the girls of 1-400 Hot Talk.

81
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,350
Briana, Tina, Marla
and me: Felicia.

82
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:02,190
Anything you want to talk about,
call me...

83
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:11,830
- I don’t know where to begin.
- Are you lonely tonight, darling?

84
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,070
- So am I. What are you wearing?
- Nothing special.

85
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,710
- Can I ask you a question?
- I'm just wearing a towel.

86
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,790
I was drying myself off,
after a hot shower...

87
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,630
Why do women leave?

88
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,590
Why do they leave? Especially
pretty ones. I can’t do it any more.

89
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:44,070
Life is very complex.
There are no guarantees.

90
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,630
The mathematical world
is completely rational.

91
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,350
You think too much. Don’t you want
to know how big my tits are?

92
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,270
No! I just want to share my life
with someone.

93
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,750
Someone
I'm not sexually attracted to.

94
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:09,510
How can two people come together
in lasting respect and affection?

95
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,190
- The world’s run by sex ads.
- Take out your own ad, I guess.

96
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,350
An ad?

97
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,350
Look at me. I'm a grown woman
wearing a prom dress.

98
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,630
I look like an over-the-hill
Barbie doll. And it’s too tight.

99
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,900
- I want something in my colour.
- Maids of honour don’t wear black.

100
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,070
- Why aren’t you wearing make-up?
- I am wearing make-up.

101
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:17,790
- You’d look good with a perm.
- Like Shirley Temple on crack.

102
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:25,430
Where is she? She can’t stand that
I'm getting all the attention.

103
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:32,190
- We should’ve had her committed.
- For excessive vanity?

104
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,430
How wonderful! Two compassionate
daughters. No make-up today?

105
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,060
I am wearing make-up.

106
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,790
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It’s an imitation Scassi.

107
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,150
- You’re my mother, not the singer.
- I'll go home and change.

108
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,510
Stop it. We’re late.
The priest is sweating.

109
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,590
All celibates sweat, dear.
If they didn’t, they’d explode.

110
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,190
I bought a snack. If I sit through
this without eating, I'll pass out.

111
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,510
It’ll only take 45 minutes.

112
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,790
Marrying outside your faith,
and on the Sabbath...

113
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,510
All I know about the Sabbath is that
Bergdorf’s isn’t too crowded.

114
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,220
I want you to remember,
today is my day.

115
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,230
Behave, or I'll blow up your birth
certificate into a Christmas card.

116
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,750
I should have never
encouraged you to speak.

117
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,790
Maybe she’ll look back
and turn into a pillar of salt.

118
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,910
Alex looks nervous.

119
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:56,150
- I hope I'm doing the right thing.
- I think you are.

120
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,070
The party is about to get started.
The dance floor is all yours!

121
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,950
Okay girls, lick your lips.

122
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,190
Tell Claire I'm looking for her.

123
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,980
Your husband’s a lucky guy.

124
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,790
- Waiter! Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.

125
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,790
- Two more drinks, when you can.
- This looks delicious.

126
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,510
- I can’t believe he’s married.
- And that he chose Claire over you.

127
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,430
- I told you not to introduce them.
- She was married, I didn’t think.

128
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:51,310
- How are you handling all this?
- No more fantasies of handsome men.

129
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,310
- There’s a guy out there somewhere.
- Who? Barry Neufeldt?

130
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:03,390
What’s wrong with him, other than
that he looks like Gumpy?

131
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,550
Gumby, not Gumpy.

132
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:14,590
- I'm no great prize, either.
- You’re a great person and teacher.

133
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,910
I think I've reached the point where
you know you’ll never get married.

134
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:27,110
Married? What’s marriage? A ring,
a contract. Fighting, compromising.

135
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:33,950
It can be more than that. You know
what I envy about people in love?

136
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,430
I'd love it
if someone really knew me.

137
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:45,460
What I like. What I'm afraid of.
What kind of toothpaste I use.

138
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,150
I think
that would really be wonderful.

139
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,310
Hey, sister-in-law,
having a good time?

140
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,790
- Have you seen Claire?
- No, I'll find her for you.

141
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,660
You look beautiful tonight. I'm not
just saying that. You really do.

142
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,140
I heard you.

143
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,830
Why don’t you have some coffee?
I'll find Claire.

144
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,630
- Alex is looking for you.
- Brother, it’s starting already?

145
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,420
How could you do this?
I'll never forgive you.

146
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,630
- Yes. .!
- I'm Professor Gregory Larkin.

147
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,270
I'm calling about the response to
my ad. Is this Professor Morgan?

148
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,350
- I'm her sister. She knows nothing.
- Then maybe we shouldn’t talk.

149
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,470
No! Rose would never answer herself.
Most of these guys are creeps.

150
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,070
But when it said you taught
at Columbia, something just clicked.

151
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,110
- You have seen her picture, right?
- Yes.

152
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,950
- And. .?
- And what?

153
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,310
Nothing. Great.

154
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,270
Make way, please.

155
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,950
This is the scene
at my sister’s wedding.

156
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,590
She’s getting drunk, regretting that
she got married for the third time.

157
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,270
My mom’s sprouting snakes from her
hair in jealousy. It was perfect...

158
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,350
We’ve got three feminine archetypes:
The divine whore, Medusa -

159
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,110
- And me. What archetype am I?

160
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,510
- The Virgin Mary?
- Thanks a lot, Trevor.

161
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:55,020
No, the faithful handmaiden. Always
the bridesmaid, never the bride.

162
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,990
It proves what Jung said all along.

163
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,180
Myths and archetypes are alive
and well and living in my apartment.

164
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,870
As I stood beside the altar beside
my sister and her husband to be. - 

165
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,510
- It struck me that this ritual,
a wedding ceremony. - 

166
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,270
- Is the last scene of a fairy tale.
They never say what happens after.

167
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:27,790
That Cinderella drove the prince mad
by obsessively cleaning the castle.

168
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,390
They don’t say what happens after
because there is no after.

169
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,030
The be-all and end-all
of romantic love was... Mike?

170
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,140
- Sex?
- You have sex on the brain.

171
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,150
- Marriage.
- But it wasn’t always like that.

172
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:53,070
The 12th century had "courtly love",
which had nothing to do with sex.

173
00:19:53,230 --> 00:20:00,470
The relationship between a knight
and a married lady of the court...

174
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,710
And so they could never
consummate their love.

175
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:11,510
They rose above "going to the toilet
in front of each other" love. - 

176
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:17,270
- And went after
something more divine.

177
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:23,590
They took sex out of the equation,
leaving them with a union of souls.

178
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,700
Think of this. Sex was always
the fatal love potion.

179
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,670
Look at the literature of the time.

180
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,510
All consummation could lead to was
madness, despair or death.

181
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,620
Experts, scholars and my Aunt Esther
are united in one belief:

182
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:48,710
True love has spiritual dimensions,
while romantic love is a lie.

183
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:55,510
A myth. A soulless manipulation.
And speaking of manipulation...

184
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,350
It’s like going to the movies
and seeing the lovers kiss...

185
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,110
The music swells,
and we buy it, right?

186
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,110
So when my date kisses me, and I
don’t hear strings, I dump him.

187
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,910
The question is,
why do we buy it?

188
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:21,430
Because, myth or manipulation,
we all want to fall in love.

189
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,140
That experience makes us feel
completely alive.

190
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:34,470
Our everyday reality is shattered,
and we are flung into the heavens.

191
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,990
It may only last a moment, an hour,
but that doesn’t diminish its value.

192
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,030
We’re left with memories we
treasure for the rest of our lives.

193
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:50,540
I read, "When we fall in love,
we hear Puccini in our heads."

194
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:59,460
I love that. His music expresses our
need for passion and romantic love.

195
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,580
We listen to La Boheme or Turandot,
or read Wuthering Heights. - 

196
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,830
- Or watch Casablanca, and a little
of that love lives in us too.

197
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:15,390
So the final question is:
Why do people want to fall in love -

198
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,030
- When it can have such a short run
and be so painful?

199
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,140
- Propagation of the species?
- We need to connect with somebody.

200
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:32,180
- Are we culturally preconditioned?
- Good, but too intellectual for me.

201
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,060
I think it’s because,
as some of you may already know...

202
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,430
While it does last,
it feels fucking great.

203
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,750
I'm almost finished,
and you haven’t started yet.

204
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,870
The perfect bite.

205
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,510
You need a therapist.

206
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,950
Do we have to have the TV on?
Can’t we have a conversation?

207
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,110
I'm not intellectually stimulating,
like your university people...

208
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,350
I'm sorry. How was your day, Mother?

209
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,510
- Who gives a shit?
- I said I was sorry. Let’s talk.

210
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,220
I've lived too long.
I should be dead.

211
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,780
Give me that! Talk to me already!

212
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:55,270
All right. You haven’t even noticed
I had my hair done differently.

213
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,390
I thought you looked different.
It looks great.

214
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:09,390
- What’s different about it?
- The...

215
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:15,710
Nothing. You’re just like
your father. So easy to trip up.

216
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:25,310
- So, how was work?
- Same as always.

217
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,100
Though I had one customer in
for a make-over. She needed one.

218
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:35,670
Dyed blonde hair. Blue eye shadow.
Ash-brown foundation. Hideous.

219
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,910
- She was shocked over my age.
- How old were you?

220
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,220
Sorry.

221
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,590
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.
He cornered me in the elevator.

222
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,380
He invited me to an Alzheimer’s
benefit. I said forget it.

223
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:03,110
I can’t believe he still asks you.
Why don’t you go with him sometime?

224
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,900
No... I raised two daughters.
I buried a husband. That’s my life.

225
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,910
I don’t want to start another.
And he knows my situation with you.

226
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,790
You won’t see him because of me?

227
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,790
How would it look? The mother’s
dating and the daughter stays home?

228
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,470
Who’s looking?

229
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,670
Hello... Hi.

230
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,910
Hello, this is...

231
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,430
Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin.

232
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,620
Professor Gregory Larkin.

233
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,900
Answer the phone. I'm sleeping.

234
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,110
Is Professor Larkin there?
I mean, is Professor Morgan there?

235
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:05,430
- Barely. Who’s this?
- Gregory Larkin.

236
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,590
I'm a professor
in the math department at Columbia.

237
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,310
I was just calling to see...

238
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:22,910
- How are you tonight?
- I'm fine. How are you?

239
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,620
Fine.

240
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:39,830
I hope it wasn't presumptuous
of me, but I went to your class -

241
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,940
- And was very impressed. I hoped
we could eat dinner Saturday.

242
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,910
- Louder!
- I sat in on your class.

243
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,780
- Hold on. Don’t go away.
- I was impressed by your teaching.

244
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,990
I was hoping
we could have dinner Saturday.

245
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,390
I can do this!

246
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,470
Can you hear me?

247
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:14,750
- Okay... You want to eat dinner.
- I sat in on your class.

248
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,590
- Who’s on the phone?
- Quiet! No, not you.

249
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,990
Gregory Larkin.
Math department. Columbia.

250
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,710
- I saw you pass by.
- I was just passing by...

251
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:16,870
- I'm sorry about calling...
- I was so confused.

252
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,150
- Are we on for Saturday night?
- Sure.

253
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,620
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Moi aussi.

254
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,990
He must be good-looking,
for you to go to all this trouble.

255
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,310
- I hate lipstick.
- Did you try the samples I brought?

256
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,020
- I'm not going.
- Oh, what do you want for dinner?

257
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,820
I don’t care. I'm upset.
Can’t you see that?

258
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:54,830
- You always cancel your dates.
- This is not a date.

259
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,300
Then why does it matter how you look
with this one?

260
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:04,270
Stop calling him "this one".
And nothing’s going to happen.

261
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:09,510
You need more colour.
Let me do it.

262
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,910
- Don’t make me look like a clown.
- You won’t look like a clown.

263
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,070
- Where’s the hairpiece?
- Shall I make you something to eat?

264
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,270
Make him wait. He mustn’t think he’s
the only date you’ve had in years.

265
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,710
Where’s the bow?

266
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,910
Hey, your mother did you up again.
Looks great! Can I get you a cab?

267
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,990
Sorry.

268
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,430
Are you sure?
You’re going to take me?

269
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,910
Here’s where I'm going, but don’t go
until I put up the window.

270
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,780
- They’re broke, lady.
- My hair!

271
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,950
Don’t complain to me.
Complain to the cab company.

272
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,310
- I'm sorry.
- For what? You’re exactly on time.

273
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:33,230
My hair. I must look like
I was attacked by wolves.

274
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,020
I didn’t even notice.

275
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,870
Could you excuse me while I go
to the ladies" room for a minute?

276
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,030
Do you enjoy dancing?

277
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,470
I used to love to dance
with my father. You?

278
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:03,070
I find it embarrassing.
I enjoy watching it.

279
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,670
- Watching?
- Pairs...

280
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,430
It’s interesting how coupling
appears in nature and mathematics.

281
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:17,510
- You were talking about pairs...
- Oh, the twin-prime conjecture.

282
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:23,310
It explores pairs of prime numbers.
Those only divisible by themselves.

283
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,070
Three-five. Five-seven.
Not seven-nine...

284
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:34,180
- Nine can be divided by three.
- That’s right.

285
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,550
11-13 and 17-19 and so on.

286
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,790
It was discovered that pairs
were often separated by...

287
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:51,460
- One number in between.
- Exactly. Did you read my book?

288
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,710
- No, I'm sorry.
- That’s okay. This is marvellous.

289
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,950
- A first date like a game show.
- I didn’t mean to lecture.

290
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,870
I'm sorry,
I didn’t mean to call it a date.

291
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:11,030
It’s just rare that I meet a person
I can discuss these things with.

292
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,670
- Some pepper?
- No, not for me.

293
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:21,270
Could you bring me a side dish
of extra dressing?

294
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,350
I don’t particularly like salad,
I just like the dressing.

295
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:33,990
Interesting theory. Are there still
pairs like that past a million?

296
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:44,660
I can’t believe you thought of that.
That is what is to be proven.

297
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,630
I have concert tickets next
Saturday. Can we do this again?

298
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,990
- Sure.
- Great. Terrific.

299
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:03,590
What was it you wanted to discuss
about my teaching?

300
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,860
I have to confess. That was
just an excuse to meet you.

301
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,190
I hope you don’t mind.

302
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:18,830
I found it interesting. I have many
questions, the first of which is:

303
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,710
How do you get them to stay?

304
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,830
Well?

305
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,910
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?

306
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,950
Don’t ask.

307
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,590
- You won’t be seeing him again?
- We’re going out next week.

308
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,110
So, he must like you.

309
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,550
Did he kiss you?

310
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,460
No.

311
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,710
That’s kind of sweet, actually.

312
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,540
Hi.
This is Cindy.

313
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,790
This is a spectrum analyzer.

314
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:36,270
It makes graphic representations
of the music. Watch.

315
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,670
- Who’s the girl?
- Rose Morgan.

316
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:48,620
Henry Fine is a professor
in anthropology.

317
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:55,270
Beautiful music, isn’t it?
Beautiful atmosphere.

318
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:19,550
I enjoyed that.
Thank you so much for inviting me.

319
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:26,190
Why don’t you come up? I'd like
to give you a copy of my book.

320
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:32,830
I'd love that. Your book, I mean.
Not to come up to your apartment.

321
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,670
But Rose, I'm inviting you.

322
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,860
If you like this kind of music,
I have some wonderful CD's, but...

323
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,580
...they’re also in my apartment.

324
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:51,860
I have to be honest with you.
I'm a bit out of practice with this.

325
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,190
I want you to feel comfortable.
That’s important to me.

326
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:01,510
I want to tell you upfront.
I'm not interested in sex.

327
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,190
- You’re not?
- And it has nothing to do with you.

328
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:11,380
It has to do with what you were
talking about in your class.

329
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,910
I, too, believe it’s illusions about
love and the emphasis on sex -

330
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:23,310
- That separate people today.
As you said, romance is a myth.

331
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,150
I was referring to academic opinions
that are purely subjective.

332
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:35,270
You were right! Relationships based
on romantic love are worthless.

333
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,950
Did you stay for my whole class?

334
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:44,190
I left when you mentioned the music
we hear when lovers kiss in films.

335
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:50,110
It is manipulative! In real life,
we don’t hear music when we kiss.

336
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,230
And the person you’re with isn’t a
movie star. It’s a malicious...

337
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:59,100
Fantasy? Is it all right
if I sit down for a minute?

338
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:06,910
The addiction to beauty and
perfection created by advertising -

339
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:13,150
- Feeds on people’s pathetic hopes.
They don’t have their own opinions.

340
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,430
The media tells us what’s beautiful.

341
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,460
TV shows tell us what a relationship
is supposed to be like. And sex!

342
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,950
I don’t even want to tell you
how that’s ruined my life...

343
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,030
Well, I go crazy.

344
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,470
When I want someone sexually,
I go out of my mind.

345
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,910
Do you remember that film
where the woman kills the bunny?

346
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:42,230
- "Fatal Attraction"?
- Granted, it was a film.

347
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:47,710
But I understand how she felt.
Not that I would kill an animal. - 

348
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:54,140
- But I know the feeling of wanting
someone so much that it hurts.

349
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:59,470
This fiction, known as love,
drives people crazy, as you said.

350
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:04,340
- Then you’re either mad, alone...
- Or dead. But that was fiction.

351
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,230
Right! We’re dead!

352
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:14,070
I do believe two people can
come together, even marry. - 

353
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,910
- For reasons
more concrete than sex.

354
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:24,830
A love that grows out of respect,
love, trust, common interest.

355
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,940
Have you noticed that friendships
last longer than marriages?

356
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:35,790
The 12th century was on to
something. Would you like coffee?

357
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:42,750
- Got any scotch?
- Yeah.

358
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,910
Are you busy this week? I was hoping
you could help me with my teaching.

359
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,150
You give yourself too little credit.

360
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,940
Maybe you could sit in
on one of my classes.

361
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:59,590
If X squared plus Y squared
equals 16. - 

362
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,670
- How do we find DYIDX
as an implicit function of X and Y?

363
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:08,270
Well, Y is a function of X...

364
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:19,940
You walk across the room like this,
and you’re into your own thing.

365
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:26,630
Your body language is very detached,
very alienating.

366
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:31,070
I think you have to relate more
to the kids.

367
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,790
You’re up there with your back to
the room, solving your own problems.

368
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:41,470
It’s like you’re having a math
party, and only invited yourself.

369
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:48,150
- Relax. Loosen up. Have some fun.
- Relax. Have fun... What else?

370
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:53,550
Loosen up. Put the pen down,
I'm not going to test you on this.

371
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,180
Come on. Teach me something.

372
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:05,230
If a ball is thrown up into the air,
and its height, H, equals 100 T...

373
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,710
What are you doing?
Turn around. Talk to me.

374
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,310
If T is time in seconds,
at what limit is the speed...

375
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:21,670
You lost me.
You have to put it in context.

376
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,910
- Jazz it up, put some humor in it.
- Humor in calculus?

377
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:32,430
- Well, try telling a story.
- A story?

378
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,710
Once upon a time...

379
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,430
...there was a ball.

380
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,220
It was thrown into the air.

381
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:55,110
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.

382
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,590
No one understands those, either.
Just kidding.

383
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:06,190
- Don’t give up. Try it again.
- Tell you another story?

384
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,710
Hi, Professor Larkin... Sorry.

385
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,590
That’s all right.

386
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,910
- Do we have an appointment?
- Actually, I wanted to make one.

387
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:29,260
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?

388
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:38,900
- My head is swimming. It’s hot.
- Put your head between your legs.

389
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,260
Pretty girl.

390
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,750
With all that make-up?
You don’t wear any, do you?

391
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,830
I'd still look like me,
only in colour.

392
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:58,190
You’re too smart for that. You’re
a confident, no-nonsense woman.

393
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,910
- I sound like an airline.
- I'm probably saying it wrong.

394
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,990
It’s just that
you don’t need any of that.

395
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,140
Thanks.
How’s your head?

396
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:20,310
- I think food will help you.
- Pizza, maybe?

397
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,750
Where can we go? Dancing?
Why did I say that?

398
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,510
There’s that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.

399
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,270
My mother would kill me.
What is that, Danish?

400
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,230
This is the one.

401
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,630
Trees are fascinating. They don’t
have to touch to propagate.

402
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,390
You would find that fascinating...

403
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,590
- How many do I need?
- One, two, three, four...

404
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,300
Why didn’t I see that?

405
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:00,150
- Thank you. I owe you one.
- It’s right in front of your eyes.

406
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,510
Six and a five.
I got you.

407
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:15,510
The pretzel! You can have mine.
You sounded excited on the phone.

408
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:21,750
I'm going to take my theory of love
as a man-made cultural creation -

409
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:27,470
- And expand it to include the
biological effect on the individual.

410
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,830
You need a hobby.

411
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,350
I can’t believe you’ve dated
for three months and haven’t kissed!

412
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,820
I can’t believe you’ve dated
for three months and haven’t kissed!

413
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,750
- How do you say hello?
- Well, we nod. It works.

414
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:50,710
- You mean you haven’t even touched?
- I fell once, and he picked me up.

415
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,180
We talk a lot. That’s what we do.

416
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:58,350
And I don’t worry about what I say,
what I wear, what I eat...

417
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,630
It’s a relief to eat with a man, and
not worry that he’ll be frightened.

418
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:09,390
He’s fun to be with. Maybe "fun"
isn’t the word. He’s interesting.

419
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,670
How many men can you say that about?
Is a tie too personal a gift?

420
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,380
Are you using it
on something other than his neck?

421
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:23,910
Does he look good in vests? Why do
you want him to meet your mother?

422
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:29,190
I kept saying I was a great cook,
so I offered him a birthday dinner.

423
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:35,460
Now I need something nice. After
meeting her, I won’t see him again.

424
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:42,740
- I'm starving. Can we eat?
- I can’t, I have a date.

425
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:48,780
- Find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.
- Who? We should get you some blush.

426
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:53,470
- I'm hungry, Claire.
- Fruit.

427
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,940
Why are you so grumpy?

428
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:01,140
If he wasn’t gorgeous, rich and
straight, I wouldn’t have bothered.

429
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:05,750
I'm sick to death of the man
I am bound to for eternity.

430
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,990
Why are you saying that?

431
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,990
No matter where I go, what I do,
there he is.

432
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,950
In the kitchen,
on the phone, on my finger.

433
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:20,740
I was asleep the other night.
When I wake up, he’s staring at me.

434
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:25,940
- I think that’s sweet.
- I think it’s strange.

435
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,390
Do you know
how weird that makes me feel?

436
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:34,390
A lesbian dream, and he’s staring
at me like I should include him.

437
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,630
I can’t even fantasize in private.

438
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:49,020
Mom said you’ve been seeing
someone steady. Is he cute?

439
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:56,070
- What?
- What are you doing here?

440
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:01,790
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?

441
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,870
Excuse me. I'm going
to the ladies" room. Alone.

442
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:18,620
Can you believe this weather? It's
almost April and it’s still cold.

443
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,710
I'm glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?

444
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,790
It’ll sound strange, but...

445
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:33,620
Is Claire happy?
I mean, do you think she’s happy?

446
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:39,190
Yes, I think she is.
Why?

447
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:43,140
I'm being silly.
I'm a first-time husband.

448
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:48,180
If she doesn’t wake up
and tell me she’s ecstatic, I worry.

449
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:58,430
Imagine, I have you to thank
for the fact that we’re married.

450
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:05,390
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.

451
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:10,830
- Don’t do that.
- What? What am I doing?

452
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,390
You don’t even know, do you?

453
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:21,430
Rose...

454
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:27,190
- Just tell Claire I had to run.
- Rose, I'm sorry.

455
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:37,710
I really thought I was over him.
I hate this. It’s so stupid.

456
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,670
I must sound so pathetic.

457
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:45,390
He asked if Claire was happy,
and I lied.

458
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:50,340
- Isn’t that awful?
- Nothing criminal.

459
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:56,380
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Are you feeling better now?

460
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,860
A little.

461
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:03,900
- You know, Rose, it takes time.
- Yeah, I know.

462
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:11,310
I want you to know our friendship
really means a lot to me.

463
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,390
I feel the same way,
which is why tonight...

464
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,030
I better go home, I have to get
dinner ready. I'll see you at eight.

465
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,550
Shall I bring anything
for your mother?

466
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,790
Yeah, a wooden stake
and a crucifix.

467
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:37,390
Rose loves to fold napkins.
It’s one of her idiosyncrasies.

468
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:45,030
I came home late and threw this on.
God knows how I look.

469
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,420
- I hope you like it.
- My God, Rose, it’s art!

470
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,190
It’s not art.

471
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:02,670
An artist isn’t only one who paints.
It’s one who sets the table. - 

472
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:08,860
- Prepares a meal, or teaches
in a certain way. You’re an artist.

473
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,790
Why didn’t you use the Limoges?

474
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,470
May I serve you?

475
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,070
- Rose!
- My hands are clean.

476
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,390
We go to all this trouble,
and Rose and I don’t eat very much.

477
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:30,030
I've always thought
she had a very healthy appetite.

478
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,110
I can’t stand women who eat
two bites and say they’re full.

479
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:42,710
Do you really need extra salt?
You know how it retains water.

480
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:50,390
- Can I have some? And potatoes.
- You don’t need them.

481
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:55,500
Have you ever sat in
on one of your daughter’s lectures?

482
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:00,230
- Rose!
- That’s the best part.

483
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,350
Rose tells me
you’ve never been married.

484
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,820
That’s all right, Rose.

485
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:20,830
That’s true, Mrs. Morgan. I guess
I haven’t found the right girl.

486
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:25,350
I've had relationships that haven’t
worked out, but that will change.

487
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,030
Really? Why?

488
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:35,460
As I told Rose,
I have a theory about love...

489
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,670
- And sex.
- Does anybody want coffee?

490
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:43,950
- What theory?
- Regular or decaf?

491
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:48,790
- Regular.
- I can make cappuccinos.

492
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:54,190
Would you like cappuccinos?
Greg, why don’t you help me.

493
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:59,270
- Why don’t you put the coffee on?
- I made dinner. You put it on.

494
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:05,380
I've raised two daughters, buried
a husband, I've made my coffee.

495
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,590
Alone at last.

496
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,990
- I've heard a lot about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you.

497
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:25,550
You’ve been seeing a lot
of my daughter.

498
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:31,510
I hope you don’t mind my asking...
What are your intentions?

499
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:37,020
My intentions?

500
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:44,470
What a lovely meal!
You’re a good cook.

501
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:49,070
- I didn’t oversell myself?
- Not at all, but the trouble...

502
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:53,430
Of course I had to go to
the trouble. It was your birthday.

503
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:59,860
What are friends for, but to give
each other presents and stuff...

504
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,740
Happy birthday.

505
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:09,110
Open it up!
I really hope you like it.

506
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,510
- Dice?
- They once were dice.

507
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:20,270
- Now they’re cuff links with...
- Prime numbers!

508
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:26,110
- They’re great! How’d you do that?
- I had them made just for you.

509
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:31,300
- They were done very fast.
- Thank you.

510
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,900
Well...

511
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:46,150
I've wanted to ask you something,
and I can only say this once...

512
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,190
Sit down.

513
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:55,540
We have a lot in common. Some
variables will remain unknown. - 

514
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,500
- As is the case
with most complex equations...

515
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:05,620
- Greg, talk to me.
- I'm not saying this right.

516
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:14,390
This feeling you have for Alex...
It won’t be the same with me.

517
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:21,310
You won’t have that ache in your
stomach, because we’re not in love.

518
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:26,110
I think we share
a genuine affection for each other.

519
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,470
We share a passion for knowledge
rather than a physical passion.

520
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:36,660
Although, if sex is something
that interests you. - 

521
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:42,030
- I'm sure I could provide that on
occasion, given enough warning.

522
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:47,870
- What are you saying?
- We were in love and miserable.

523
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,740
It’s a waste,
because as people, we’re valuable.

524
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:59,870
When I look at you, I see a woman
unlike any other I've known before.

525
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:06,190
Your mind, your humor, your passion
for ideas. I'm very fond of you.

526
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:10,790
When I'm with you, I feel as if...

527
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,790
...as if I'm home.

528
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,270
So I think we should get married.

529
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:25,870
People marry for sex or beauty. Are
my reasons more insane than those?

530
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:35,590
Are you in shock, or just appalled?
Blink if you can hear me.

531
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,830
Why are you laughing?

532
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:46,580
I'm sorry. This sounds silly,
but I was just thinking...

533
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:52,390
How could I marry someone
that I've never even...

534
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,750
You know...

535
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,350
...kissed.

536
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:17,630
There’s one thing I have to say.
I promised your sister I wouldn’t.

537
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:23,470
You love Claire, too?
You just slept with her?

538
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:27,340
- You want to?
- I don’t even know her.

539
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:32,030
It’s about how I found you.
I wrote this ad...

540
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,550
I think that’s kind of great.

541
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,630
- I thought you’d be upset.
- Why? You picked me.

542
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:47,350
Actually, I found you through this
charming woman on TV...

543
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,950
Well, well, well...

544
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:09,030
So?

545
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:13,390
Gregory just proposed to me.

546
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,870
Do you need a valium?

547
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:22,900
I know you don’t respect my opinion,
but I don’t trust him.

548
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:29,390
- I mean, where’s the attraction?
- He’s not attracted to me.

549
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:33,340
He doesn’t want sex.
He wants to be companions.

550
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:39,750
What sane person would agree to that
kind of marriage? It’s not natural.

551
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:46,790
Are Claire and Alex natural?
He wants me, Mother!

552
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:50,310
He wants you to cook and clean!

553
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:56,340
- He found you through an ad.
- I already know, Mom. Sorry.

554
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:04,790
It’s not your average proposal,
but let’s face it. - 

555
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:10,670
- They’re not standing in line
for me. And we like each other!

556
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:14,670
Then say yes!
I can live alone.

557
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:19,070
If you think such a marriage
is normal, then go ahead.

558
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:28,780
Why do you do that? Why do you
make it sound so pathetic?

559
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:36,540
You had a life. A husband who adored
you. Can’t I have some of that?

560
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:42,900
I'm getting older, too.
Why can’t you be happy for me?

561
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,430
But you can’t, can you?

562
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:52,540
You’re scared to death of
being alone. And you’re jealous.

563
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:59,630
Jealous because a man wants me.
A good-looking man. How ridiculous!

564
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:06,390
Well, you know something, Mom?
A man does.

565
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:27,510
Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose
Morgan have exchanged rings -

566
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,460
- And agreed to recognize each other
as equals.

567
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,910
They shall seek a life of
kindness and understanding.

568
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:42,100
The ceremony of marriage
is a means of establishing a home.

569
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:46,390
And as you have exchanged vows
before witnesses. - 

570
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:54,910
- By the authority vested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

571
00:58:55,070 --> 00:59:01,260
- Congratulations! She’s a great...
- Yes. I've heard so much about you.

572
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:06,350
- Likewise, about you.
- We all ought to...

573
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:11,110
Had I known you were this handsome,
I'd have answered the ad myself.

574
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:18,950
Congratulations. She’s the best. If
I were a man, I'd be all over her.

575
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:25,590
Congratulations. I'm sure you’ll
both be very fascinating to watch.

576
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:38,350
Rose, isn’t it amazing how many
books you accumulate over the years?

577
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:44,030
- I know what you mean.
- I can’t believe it. And the dust!

578
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:49,140
- This place needs a good cleaning.
- We’ll take care of that.

579
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:55,830
I made room for your books.
Need any help?

580
00:59:55,990 --> 01:00:00,550
Everything’s put in its place.

581
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:09,230
- What would you like to do?
- Go to bed.

582
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:16,630
To sleep... In order to sleep.
You go to the bed for sleeping.

583
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,100
- Do you want to do something else?
- What?

584
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:28,790
- I wasn’t going to say anything.
- Do you want the bathroom first?

585
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:34,430
- No, I can wait.
- No, you go. Please.

586
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,140
Your turn.

587
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,630
- Tired?
- Not really.

588
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:46,270
Me neither.
These are nice.

589
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:54,390
- You want to watch some TV?
- Sure. I have some old movies.

590
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:02,390
"It Happened One Night", "Lawrence
of Arabia", "Now, Voyager"?

591
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:07,310
How about "Lawrence of Arabia"?
it’s nice and long.

592
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:13,740
Okay. "Lawrence of Arabia" it is.

593
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:17,220
Just stick it in.

594
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:51,710
- Is it over?
- Yeah. Go to sleep.

595
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:10,430
Are you just looking or buying?

596
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:16,780
- I'm not sure yet.
- So, it it seems to be going well.

597
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,500
- Have you. .?
- No, and it’s made no difference.

598
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:26,270
- I give you both a lot of credit.
- Credit for what?

599
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:31,220
I was just telling Henry
how sex isn’t an issue for us.

600
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:37,580
It’s much less complicated this way,
not to mention sanitary.

601
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:23,460
It feels so good to be writing
again. I have so many ideas!

602
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:28,150
It’s coming so easily.
I have outlines for three chapters.

603
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:34,310
What a terrific idea to come here.
I've never written in the park.

604
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,750
Another one of these...

605
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:42,860
Is that Barry?
I think it is.

606
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:47,060
Barry...

607
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:53,420
- Hi. It’s Rose.
- How are you? This is Gloria.

608
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:58,510
- This is my husband, Gregory.
- Hi. This is Gloria.

609
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:04,430
- You got married. Congratulations.
- Thank you. You look good, Barry.

610
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:08,990
- Being engaged agrees with me.
- Congratulations!

611
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:15,500
- Finally, one who doesn’t cancel.
- Excuse me. Nice to meet you.

612
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:26,830
- I'm really happy for you both.
- Thank you, Rose. And take care.

613
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:59,310
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything’s okay.

614
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,790
What?

615
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:13,980
Jeans and a T-shirt is a good look
for you. Wear it to class sometime.

616
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:20,470
- I'd love to get the scores.
- I'll read the paper.

617
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:24,990
Oh, I didn’t tell you...

618
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:29,750
A few European universities have
invited me to lecture on my book.

619
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:35,110
I told them, of course, that I
wanted to check with you first.

620
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:40,430
- Sounds great. For how long?
- Three months.

621
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,350
Three months?

622
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:50,780
- All right, guys, let’s get going.
- How can baseball fascinate people?

623
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:54,390
You wind up
at the same place you started.

624
01:06:54,550 --> 01:07:02,270
This should interest you, because
it’s about stats and averages.

625
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:09,700
When a player comes up, they flash
a three-digit number, his average.

626
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:15,110
How many times he hits the ball,
in ratio to the number of attempts.

627
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:35,470
Anybody see the game yesterday?
Marrakesh, what a bum, huh?

628
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:41,940
Let me try
putting this another way.

629
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:47,390
If a batter hits a ball, how can we
determine how far it will go?

630
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:53,550
What variables add up to a home run,
assuming the bum could hit one?

631
01:07:53,710 --> 01:08:00,630
- The velocity of the ball?
- I have a question.

632
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,630
Does a rising fastball really rise?

633
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:11,590
I don’t know.
I'll have to ask my wife.

634
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:18,150
I could not believe it. Suddenly
the room was filled with energy.

635
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:24,230
We were exchanging ideas.
We were connected somehow.

636
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:29,230
They participated,
they questioned, they stayed!

637
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:36,750
I cannot thank you enough. I was
a better teacher because of you.

638
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:44,510
- Fresh pepper?
- Not for her, but I'll have some.

639
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:52,630
Could you bring her a side dish of
dressing? She likes a little extra.

640
01:08:52,790 --> 01:09:00,950
I feel I should return the favour.
Is there anything I can do for you?

641
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,190
I'll have to think about that.

642
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:14,510
Just glop it on.

643
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:18,310
Enjoy your dinner.

644
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:24,820
- You’re not eating.
- No, I'm watching your ritual.

645
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:28,430
I just about got your sequence now.

646
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:34,070
You start by rotating the plate
counterclockwise...

647
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:40,030
...cut on the diagonal...
remove unwanted elements...

648
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:46,060
And now comes my favourite part:
The loading of the fork.

649
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:50,990
It’s fascinating, the percentages
you use of different vegetables. - 

650
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:58,030
- To create that one
harmoniously-balanced, perfect bite.

651
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,260
You have a little...

652
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,990
Don’t smear it.

653
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:36,420
That might stain. You might want to
put a little soap on that.

654
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:40,380
I'll be right back.

655
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,630
I want to ask you something.

656
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:09,830
- Don’t stop.
- I'm not a machine.

657
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:16,470
We both have overwhelming feelings
for each other, don't we?

658
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:21,750
- You’re doing great. Keep it up.
- Okay. Ready?

659
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:27,910
- Doesn’t that music infuriate you?
- Yeah, I'm livid.

660
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:35,670
I came by your office today
for lunch, but you weren’t there.

661
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:42,590
- Were you at a staff meeting?
- I had lunch with Henry.

662
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:46,950
Rose, he’s a friend of mine,
but you have to watch out for him.

663
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:52,950
- Believe me, I'm not his type.
- He can’t always control himself.

664
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:59,590
- Did you pull something?
- I think so. Right here.

665
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:02,550
A little lower.

666
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:08,870
Lower.
Closer to the spine. There.

667
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:14,990
Lean back.

668
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:21,660
I thought you might like to meet me
in Europe after your classes end.

669
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:29,150
- We never had a honeymoon.
- That’s right. I'd love that.

670
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:33,020
Would you?

671
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:40,940
- Am I pressing too hard?
- No, but I'm all sweaty.

672
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:44,420
And I have to floss.

673
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:51,910
When you’ve got to floss,
you’ve got to floss.

674
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,740
I don’t know how to ask for it.

675
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:07,430
We’re so polite, I feel like we’re
room-mates in a charm school.

676
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,870
- I'm putting you on the speaker.
- I'm so frustrated, Claire.

677
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:18,870
- Give him an "I want sex" look.
- He’ll think something’s in my eye.

678
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:25,550
- You have to generate heat.
- Sometimes, I swear he feels it.

679
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:31,310
Men aren't that bright. It's easy.
Be subtle, mysterious, seductive.

680
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:37,870
Subtle, mysterious, seductive? Why
don’t men come with instructions?

681
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:47,670
- More coffee?
- Thanks. My tickets just arrived.

682
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:52,910
My first lecture is in Paris,
on the 24th. I leave Saturday.

683
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:56,950
- Do you want an English muffin?
- No, thanks.

684
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:03,030
- I'm off. I have an early class.
- All right. Have a nice day.

685
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:11,390
Oh... would saying now that I want
sex tonight be enough of a warning?

686
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:18,910
Or should we wait till you come back
from Europe? Yeah, that’s better.

687
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:23,860
No, no...
That’s fine.

688
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:30,870
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.

689
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,700
Have a nice day.

690
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:47,510
- Have you ever tried making love?
- It’s never been about sex.

691
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:54,020
I don’t understand. Things were
going so well. Sex now will ruin it.

692
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:57,110
You’re a very sick man.

693
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:33,470
- I have the game on for you.
- Oh, great.

694
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:39,540
- Some wine?
- I'll wake up with a headache.

695
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:45,580
- One glass.
- All right, one glass.

696
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:53,340
Same score?

697
01:15:56,150 --> 01:16:02,950
This is good. Sweet.
I normally don’t like sweet.

698
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:06,710
I'm glad you like it.
Do you...

699
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:15,630
Would you mind terribly
if we muted the TV?

700
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:27,190
- What are you doing?
- Nothing... much.

701
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:37,710
Would it be all right if I sat down?

702
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:51,670
- The wine made me warm.
- I can fix that.

703
01:16:56,350 --> 01:17:02,150
- Good game?
- I can’t hear.

704
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:15,750
That’s all right.

705
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:21,230
- Did I hurt you?
- No, you didn’t spill a drop.

706
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:26,420
- I guess...
- That’s funny? I guess it’s funny.

707
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:33,750
Do you think
we could turn the TV off?

708
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:40,510
That’s better.

709
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:45,190
- We have to relax.
- I agree.

710
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:53,950
- How are classes?
- Going well.

711
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:59,390
- And your book?
- The outline is actually...

712
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:07,580
It’s... It’s coming along.
It’s almost there.

713
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:14,110
It’s not at all what I expected.
It’s harder than I thought.

714
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:17,470
But I'll...

715
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:24,110
I'm sure that... I'll get there.

716
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:27,740
I want you to get there.

717
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:40,990
What did you say?

718
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:45,390
- Rose...
- Talk to me.

719
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,750
Oh, yes... Oh, no...

720
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:15,310
Oh, God.
Oh, Rose.

721
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:19,150
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

722
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:23,750
I don’t want to do this!
I'm sorry, Rose.

723
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:08,150
I have to say, Rose, that I'm a
little confused. A bit disappointed.

724
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:17,950
It was going so well.
At least, I thought so. Didn’t you?

725
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:24,910
Is that the truth, or some kind of
manipulation? Tell me the truth.

726
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:30,470
You knew the agreement, how I felt.
Did you think it would change?

727
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,910
Why?

728
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:40,470
I hoped, though I made the offer,
you’d see there was no need for it.

729
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:43,430
I'd hoped that we’d got beyond it.

730
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:46,510
Did you think
this was the next step?

731
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:54,670
What we have usually comes after
all this nonsense is over.

732
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:59,700
Most never get to where we are.
They try to keep the sex going. - 

733
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:06,750
- Or find another. Our relationship
works because it isn’t physical.

734
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:12,110
I took every precaution to make sure
there was no physical attraction!

735
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:18,950
Rose, I'm sorry.

736
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:29,030
I've never had this with a woman.
I can share everything with you.

737
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:36,350
Are you not satisfied with me?

738
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:44,670
Maybe this is something we have to
struggle through together.

739
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:52,100
Maybe this tour is coming at a good
time. Maybe we can use the distance.

740
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:57,710
Don’t you think?
I thought we were good friends.

741
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:06,230
Talk to me, Rose. Let me in.
I'm sorry.

742
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,230
Open the door.

743
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:25,030
Open the door, please.
Come on, Rose.

744
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:39,470
What are you doing here?

745
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:46,510
I just came to sleep in my own bed.
Is that okay?

746
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:50,510
What happened? Is it Gregory?

747
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:55,270
I don’t want to say I told you so,
but...

748
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,350
- Mom.
- What?

749
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:03,830
When I was a baby,
did you think I was pretty?

750
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:08,950
All babies are pretty.

751
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:14,230
No, I mean me.

752
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:23,350
You must have thought something
about how I looked.

753
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:29,990
Oh, what’s pretty, anyway?
What good did it do your sister?

754
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:41,270
Do you remember
when I was a little girl?

755
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:49,990
You told me to push up my nose
with my index finger.

756
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:55,150
- So it wouldn’t droop.
- I did not! Are you drunk?

757
01:24:55,310 --> 01:25:01,750
That’s what you told me. It’s funny,
I never would have thought -

758
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:08,390
- That I wasn’t pretty, if it
weren’t for those things you said.

759
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:13,630
If you came to say more cruel things
to me, I'm going to bed.

760
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:16,910
- Mom...
- What?

761
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:21,790
- How did it feel?
- What?

762
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:27,430
Being beautiful?
No, I mean it.

763
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:34,550
How did it feel having people
look at you with such admiration?

764
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:44,300
Looking at yourself in the mirror
with such appreciation?

765
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:50,430
How did that feel?

766
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:00,430
It was wonderful.

767
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,670
I bet.

768
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:26,990
- This is Gregory. Is Rose there?
- She's out. Can I take a message?

769
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:31,750
No. I've been giving you messages,
and she hasn’t called back.

770
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,700
- I want to say goodbye to my wife.
- I'll tell her.

771
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:54,460
I wanted to say goodbye to you
myself, not through your mother.

772
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:59,830
I don't like leaving this way,
but my plane is here.

773
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:04,030
I hope your mother
doesn't erase this message.

774
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:09,630
I don't know what else to say.

775
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:16,670
I wanted to say goodbye to you
myself, not through your mother.

776
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:34,980
- You’re up early.
- I haven’t been to bed.

777
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:40,990
- You haven’t been to bed?
- No.

778
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:46,390
Why not?

779
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:50,750
I had a lot to think about,
after you left.

780
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:55,430
It’s awful to leave a woman my age
alone with her thoughts.

781
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:06,070
You really love him, don’t you?

782
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:12,430
You do, it’s obvious.

783
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:18,950
That feeling...

784
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:23,630
...you have for Gregory...

785
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:32,350
I don’t think I ever felt that.
Not even for your father.

786
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:40,750
It’s not easy for me to say.
Especially to you.

787
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:48,030
It’s awful
to look back on your life -

788
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:52,510
- And realise that you’ve settled.

789
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:57,300
The problem was that I always felt
I had more time.

790
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:03,950
I was...
Now, inside, I feel young.

791
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:10,630
Like it’s the beginning.
Like I have everything ahead of me.

792
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:14,550
But I don’t.

793
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:20,670
So I guess I am jealous.

794
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:30,630
Parents don’t have a plan
to hurt their children.

795
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:38,990
- I never wanted to hurt you.
- I'm not that hurt.

796
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:44,430
Do you know what I thought
when you were a baby?

797
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:51,350
That you looked just like your dad,
and that Claire looked like me.

798
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:54,870
What’s that?

799
01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:04,590
She was so pretty, even then.
Look at those eyes. Those lips.

800
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,470
That’s not Claire, that’s you.

801
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:11,420
Me?
I never saw this picture.

802
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:17,630
- I found it when I was cleaning up.
- This was me?

803
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,310
I was pretty?

804
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:26,750
Your father adored you.
But you know that.

805
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:31,830
He never felt that way about Claire.
Only you.

806
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:36,750
I don’t think he ever held a baby
until you came.

807
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:41,190
He never wanted to let you go.

808
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:49,540
- I'm glad you found this.
- So am I.

809
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,110
She was very pretty.

810
01:30:54,270 --> 01:31:00,190
You were very pretty.
Remember that.

811
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:04,230
Thank you for your warm welcome.
It’s an honour for me to be here.

812
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:10,230
Rose, I'd love to speak with you.
I never seem to catch you at home.

813
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:16,260
We should discuss this, Rose. I have
no judgement over what happened.

814
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:21,300
I'm leaving for Venice tomorrow
and wanted to say happy birthday.

815
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:25,430
I have a present for you.
It’s a week at a baseball camp.

816
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:40,660
Hello, Rose?

817
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:45,510
Rose, are you there?

818
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:52,910
- Henry, have you heard from her?
- She cancelled her summer classes.

819
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:57,150
- How do you know that?
- I called her mother.

820
01:32:57,310 --> 01:33:04,150
- Rose, try this one. It’s an eight.
- I like the black one, in a six.

821
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:11,550
Rose, I can’t believe how childishly
you’re behaving. It’s unlike you.

822
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:15,070
- How did she finally persuade you?
- It’s a long story.

823
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:20,790
I'm changing my plans.
I'll be in New York on Monday.

824
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:27,550
My number here is:
01-71-25773-55.

825
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:31,750
All prime numbers, by the way.

826
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:47,510
Hello?

827
01:33:58,590 --> 01:34:02,060
Rose?
Are you there?

828
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:12,110
- Rose?
- I'll be right out.

829
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:37,710
May I have a glass, too?

830
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:05,830
Good to see you, Greg.
How was your trip?

831
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:10,460
Are you all right?

832
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:16,310
- Traveling doesn’t agree with me.
- You need a glass of water?

833
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:20,910
- What happened to you?
- I just made a few changes.

834
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:25,070
- What did you do to your hair?
- I lightened it.

835
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:34,190
- And you’re wearing make-up.
- Women do that from time to time.

836
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:39,030
It’s not like I had surgery,
although my mother offered.

837
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:42,550
- Are you hungry?
- You never wore make-up.

838
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:48,430
I know. The no-frills girl.
Like I said, I made some changes.

839
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:51,390
And you lost weight.

840
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:56,750
These have no oil or butter.
You just have to get used to it.

841
01:35:56,910 --> 01:36:03,470
- What have you done?
- I put on make-up and lost weight.

842
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:09,580
You don’t return my calls, you
completely cut me off, then this...

843
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:15,230
I'm... speechless.

844
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:23,710
- I guess you don’t like it.
- Don’t like it? I'm in shock.

845
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:28,270
I come home to find a completely
different woman. Why did you do it?

846
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:31,430
Why do I have to explain this?

847
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:36,830
I'm your husband. And I married
a woman who looked a certain way.

848
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:42,550
- I feel sort of betrayed.
- Oh, please!

849
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:46,710
You had no right.
Why did you do this to me?

850
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:53,110
Do what to you? What does it matter
how I look? You never look at me.

851
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:59,070
If appearance doesn’t matter,
what’s wrong with this appearance?

852
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,070
Sorry if it upsets
your mathematical equation.

853
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:07,020
"Handsome, frightened man marries
unattractive, desperate woman."

854
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:14,950
I was simply expecting someone else.
I'll just have to get used to it.

855
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:20,790
- You don’t have to get used to it.
- What do you mean?

856
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:24,740
I don’t want to continue.

857
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:29,740
I don’t understand.

858
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:38,390
I apologize. I settled
for something that I didn’t want.

859
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:45,110
I thought I could live with that.
But I lied, to myself and to you.

860
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:50,590
To be honest, I think your theory
about relationships is bullshit.

861
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:57,550
I believe in love, lust, sex and
romance, not in a perfect equation.

862
01:37:57,710 --> 01:38:02,340
I want mess and chaos. I want
someone to go crazy for me.

863
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:08,110
I want passion and heat and sweat
and madness! Valentines and cupids!

864
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:12,630
I want it all,
and I want to thank you. - 

865
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:17,420
- Because you forced me to look at
things I was too scared to look at.

866
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:22,110
Imagine, all this time I kept up
this ridiculous fantasy -

867
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:28,220
- That you, like Alex, would fall in
love with me. It was wrong of me.

868
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:32,350
- But I think...
- I know. Just let me finish.

869
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:37,300
- I feel...
- Strongly about your beliefs. Fine.

870
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:44,190
I'm sorry I broke the agreement,
but I fell in love with you.

871
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:49,140
But it’s all right now, because
I'm not in love with you any more.

872
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,740
What?

873
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:59,710
Which now makes me perfect for this,
but now I don’t want this marriage.

874
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:10,030
Suddenly dinner doesn’t seem like
such a good idea.

875
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:15,470
I should go.

876
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:22,150
- Are you going to your mother’s?
- Just until I find my own place.

877
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:29,990
I hope at some point we can pick up
where we left off, as friends.

878
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:36,420
Thanks. You’re the first man who
wanted to marry me, for any reason.

879
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:42,390
Can I call you tomorrow?

880
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:47,340
What for?

881
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:14,460
You all have copies of the syllabus?
There will be four short papers.

882
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:18,870
Be prepared to also discuss these
in class.

883
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:27,460
Some of my students from last term
can tell you how important...

884
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:33,110
What?

885
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:39,790
Yes, I have breasts. They cannot,
however, be the subject for a paper.

886
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:42,750
A double play!

887
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:48,310
I miss her, but I'm proud
that I stood up for what I believe.

888
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:53,950
It could have worked. Not with her,
but it was an invaluable experience.

889
01:40:55,990 --> 01:41:02,260
You’re in bad shape, aren’t you?
May I make a suggestion?

890
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:06,990
Put all your valuable possessions
in storage.

891
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:11,940
- Why?
- So you won’t break anything.

892
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:17,910
I just told you, I'm fine. I'm using
all of this in my next book.

893
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:21,150
Especially glass.

894
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:26,390
I miss him, Claire.
But I don’t think he’s ready for me.

895
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:33,590
I still can’t get used to seeing you
like this. It’s sort of unnerving.

896
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:36,060
You’re just like the rest of us now.

897
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:43,190
Now you’ll spend an hour in front of
the mirror, every morning and night.

898
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:49,380
Now you'll be scanning for who looks
better than you and who doesn’t.

899
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:52,940
As the years go by,
the numbers change. - 

900
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:58,270
- Until you walk into a room and
you’re the last one any man notices.

901
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:04,870
Rose?
My God! Rose!

902
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:09,980
- Hi, Alex.
- I can’t believe it’s you.

903
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:14,230
- Alex, get a fucking grip.
- You look incredible. Doesn’t she?

904
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:17,860
Yes, we already covered that.

905
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:54,190
I thought you hated salad.

906
01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:58,470
I can’t eat a cheeseburger
in the middle of the day any more.

907
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:02,750
- Doesn’t it bloat you?
- No.

908
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:08,590
I thought it went well with
the spareribs I had for breakfast.

909
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:17,190
- What’s the matter?
- I'm sorry.

910
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:22,950
I always thought we’d be in the
same boat. It made it easier.

911
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:32,190
I'll tell you what.

912
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:37,630
I'll give you half my salad if you
give me half your burger.

913
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:41,630
- We’ll need some more dressing.
- Definitely. Waiter!

914
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:45,630
We all want to be attractive.
But remember:

915
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:54,300
One of the first things
people notice is your smile.

916
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:59,340
Your appearance is probably
important to you.

917
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:04,630
We spend so much time, energy and
money in an effort to look good.

918
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:08,100
We all want to be attractive.

919
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:30,030
Hello, it's Alex.

920
01:44:30,190 --> 01:44:35,060
- How are you?
- I'm trying to get on with my life.

921
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:39,670
- What’s wrong with you?
- Claire's gone.

922
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:47,350
I came home to surprise her at lunch
and found her with her masseur.

923
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:51,590
It’s my own fault.
Claire hates surprises.

924
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:58,230
- Alex, I'm really sorry.
- I don’t know why she wasn’t happy.

925
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:03,910
- I couldn’t have loved her more.
- It wouldn’t have mattered.

926
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:11,190
- Claire was jealous of you.
- Jealous of me?

927
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:14,270
She got so mad
every time I'd talk about you.

928
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:17,550
She thought I had a crush on you.

929
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:21,940
Maybe she was right.

930
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:32,270
Do you want to have dinner with me?
I'm asking you to dinner.

931
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:39,270
I have to think about it.
I'll have to ask Claire.

932
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:46,550
- D! You’re improving!
- I don’t understand twin primes.

933
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:49,180
I'm explaining it!

934
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:55,540
An infinite set minus an infinite
number leaves an infinite number.

935
01:45:55,710 --> 01:46:00,740
We spent time on this! My wife
understood it on our first date!

936
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:06,940
Class dismissed!

937
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:11,510
Get out of here! Go!

938
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:25,830
Very enjoyable dinner.

939
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:29,910
- Did you cook it yourself?
- Yes, I did.

940
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:33,750
- What a liar.
- Yes, I am.

941
01:46:35,190 --> 01:46:37,910
What?

942
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:43,230
I only smoke when I'm with you.
I wonder why?

943
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:57,390
I can’t thank you enough
for the other day. For tonight.

944
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:04,300
You’re such an inspiration.
The way you’ve changed...

945
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:09,910
...evolved, I guess,
is a better word. - 

946
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:16,510
- Into this beautiful... smart...

947
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:21,470
...very sexy...

948
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:35,430
I must have loved you all along.
I just didn’t know it.

949
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:40,630
What an idiot.

950
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:52,750
Hannah, this is ridiculous.
She can’t not talk to me forever.

951
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:58,990
- What are you doing?
- I have to explain things.

952
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:03,830
- It’s a little late for that.
- No, I don't think so.

953
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:08,860
What Rose and I have goes far beyond
what normal people...

954
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:13,740
What's all that noise? What are you
trying to say? What is going on?

955
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:20,830
- Put her on the damn phone now!
- She's not here.

956
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:25,830
I might as well tell you,
she's with Alex now.

957
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:31,550
She’s with him now. You know
how much she’s always cared for him.

958
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:35,870
So I see no point in you
pursuing this any further.

959
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:51,580
I'm sorry to keep you waiting. So,
Mr. Jenkins, which do you like best?

960
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:56,670
To be perfectly honest,
I think you’re more beautiful now.

961
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:00,870
Good answer.

962
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:13,510
What did you mean by, you must
have loved me but didn’t know it?

963
01:49:13,670 --> 01:49:19,470
- I'd like an answer.
- You were different then.

964
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:24,950
- How could you have loved me then?
- I loved you for who you were.

965
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:30,950
So now you want who I am
because I'm not who I was any more?

966
01:49:32,030 --> 01:49:34,870
Rose, what?

967
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:40,110
I have dreamt about this moment
from the first day we met.

968
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:46,270
I've played out what you’d say and
what you’d think a million times.

969
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:51,830
- But you were better in my head.
- Maybe I've had too much to drink.

970
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:56,310
It’s not you, it’s me. I don’t
feel anything. Isn’t that great?

971
01:49:56,470 --> 01:50:00,630
I never thought about my feelings,
only yours.

972
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:07,350
- I didn’t think I was good enough.
- Oh, but you are!

973
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:13,350
I know. But Alex,
you’re not good enough for me.

974
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:23,110
She’s with Alex now, Henry.

975
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:27,470
I don’t know if it’s my head
or my stomach.

976
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:34,590
I might have Chinese food poisoning.
Maybe my Szechwan chicken was a cat.

977
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:38,750
I'm so dizzy.

978
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:44,670
I was all alone,
and I didn’t know what to do.

979
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:49,150
- I'm sorry, Henry.
- You’ll just stay here tonight.

980
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:53,550
Henry, I love Rose.

981
01:50:53,710 --> 01:51:01,190
The old Rose. The one with no
make-up who loves the perfect bite.

982
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:05,950
I love her. It’s real.
It’s not based on passion. - 

983
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:12,350
- Although I feel that. Or lust,
although I feel that.

984
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:21,310
Or even physical attraction. She...
Though I thought she was beautiful.

985
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:28,660
Her eyes, her mouth. The way she
held herself, made fun of herself.

986
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:35,030
She eats carrots now.
Isn’t that tragic?

987
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:37,390
What am I going to do?

988
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:42,750
In the last two years
I've been with 11 different women.

989
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:47,990
Most of them half my age. Not one
with a sense of humor I understood.

990
01:51:48,150 --> 01:51:53,710
I don’t do it because they’re smart.
I gave one "A Farewell to Arms". - 

991
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:58,110
- And she thought
it was a diet book.

992
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:22,230
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I want to see Miss Morgan.

993
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:28,790
It’s kind of late to visit. I don’t
think she’d want to be disturbed.

994
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:35,430
I believe... I know her
a lot better than you do.

995
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:40,430
Rose!

996
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:43,900
Do you hear that?

997
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:47,230
What the hell is going on?

998
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:55,230
- It’s him, isn’t it?
- Gregory!

999
01:52:55,390 --> 01:53:00,550
Oh, God!
I can’t believe this.

1000
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:05,550
- What is he doing out there?
- I'm going to find out.

1001
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:09,870
- He’s insane.
- I know. Isn’t it wonderful?

1002
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:18,630
Get the hell out of here!
People are trying to sleep.

1003
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:23,900
You had enough?

1004
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:27,950
- Stop!
- I'll call the police.

1005
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:32,510
- No, this is my husband.
- He doesn’t have a key?

1006
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:35,030
I said I knew her better than you.

1007
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:40,670
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

1008
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:43,710
Why did you come to see me?

1009
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:49,390
In light of our last conversation,
and after speaking with Henry...

1010
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:53,710
...although you might have serious
reservations about considering...

1011
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:58,630
Gregory, I'm aging here.
What is it you want to say?

1012
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:06,710
God, you’re beautiful.

1013
01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:11,550
Thank you.
Thank you, Gregory.

1014
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:19,910
What?

1015
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:27,790
I'm so sorry for the way I acted
and the things I said.

1016
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:32,820
I know that I hurt you.
That was the last thing I...

1017
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:38,390
- I accept your apology.
- Let me finish. This is important.

1018
01:54:41,790 --> 01:54:46,660
That night...
That terrible night...

1019
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:53,590
I wanted you so much,
I couldn’t see straight.

1020
01:54:56,550 --> 01:55:02,310
I have to make sure you know that.
It wasn’t you.

1021
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:05,150
You’re a very sexy girl.

1022
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:12,630
I know it’s unfair of me to say so,
now you’re with Alex.

1023
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:19,270
- Who said I was with Alex?
- Your mother.

1024
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:22,590
My mother? Oh, great.

1025
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:31,670
- I'm not with Alex.
- You’re not?

1026
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:40,710
- Well...
- Talk to me.

1027
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:45,870
Rose... I love you.

1028
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:51,350
And I want to be married to you.

1029
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:57,070
Gregory, you are married to me.

1030
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:02,710
That’s right. Yeah, right.

1031
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:11,670
- I'm getting a little dizzy.
- It’ll pass. Just hold on.

1032
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:17,230
- Rose, don’t ever leave me again.
- I'm not leaving you. I love you.

1033
01:56:17,390 --> 01:56:20,350
I couldn’t stand
being away from you.

1034
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:25,390
I don’t care if you are pretty.
I love you anyway.

1035
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:30,580
Everything will drop as I get older,
and I'm gaining weight as we speak.

1036
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:33,220
That’s comforting.

1037
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:32,030
- Get in, lady.
- Oh no, not you again!

1038
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:38,110
- Your windows are still broke?
- Complain to the cab company.

1039
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:39,000
