that was on my gun
when Maizie got shot.

1357
01:20:21,077 --> 01:20:25,255

coming back from makeup
with a fresh coat of powder,

1358
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:28,824
lipstick,
and Raven Red nail polish.

1359
01:20:30,564 --> 01:20:32,610
A perfect match.

the rest was easy.

1363
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:48,147
I told you Cromwell
was the blackmailer,

1364
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,454
although I wasn't quite sure
it was true at the time.

1365
01:20:50,584 --> 01:20:52,282
I figured
you'd haul over here

1366
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:54,371
and try to cream him
like you did me,

1367
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:57,853
only you missed and shot
Maizie Murdock instead.

I could've gone for you
in a big way, Dan.

1372

It would never work.

1373

do about it.

1375

just one more time.

I'm sorry, Ballantyne,
but your girl's headed
for the slammer.

What're you saying to me?

1388
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:11,491
Your fair-haired boy here
was blackmailing her,

1389
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:13,058
and she couldn't take it.

1390
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:16,235
She thought
I was the guilty party
and tried to kill me.

1391
01:22:16,366 --> 01:22:18,672
Only she missed and nailed
Maizie Murdock.

1392
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:23,939
If you ask me,
it's all Cromwell's fault.

I thought we were pals.

I don't know any of this
what he's telling me,
but I do know one thing.

1397
01:22:37,691 --> 01:22:41,478
You don't work
for Paravox anymore.

1398
01:22:41,608 --> 01:22:43,262
Bernie, I can explain.And I'll tell you
another thing.

By the time
I get through with you,
