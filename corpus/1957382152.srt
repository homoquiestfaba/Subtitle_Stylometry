00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:11,108
Okay, have you seen
"Fireworks at Beaumont"

177
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,343
with Patrick J. Michaels?

178
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,411
Uh, uh...
(stammering)

179
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,547
It's a classic '80s movie.
He spends all of senior

180
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,981
trying to get
with the prettiest girl

181
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,583
and it's not until the
very last day of school

182
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,418
that... that there's
this beautiful concert.

183
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:23,320
And he grabs the guitar,
and then boom, it happens.

184
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,089
And she falls in
love with him at the end.

185
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,358
It happens.
It will happen.

186
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,026
(thunder rumbling)

187
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,595
I can't describe my
high school experience yet

188
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:33,097
because it's not over.

189
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:34,932
It can't be.

190
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,169
Okay.

191
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:42,039
Get me the
essay by Sunday.

192
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,408
Sunday,
that's in a few days.

193
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,578
Yeah, that's me
giving you a break, okay?

194
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,081
If you don't turn it in,
you're not gonna graduate.

195
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:54,084
And your real high
school experience will be spent

196
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,186
in summer school with me.

197
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,990
That's not a
fun essay to write.

198
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,025
(thunder rumbling)

199
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,594
I can't write
your paper, man.

200
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,196
I gotta spend my
weekend looking for food trucks.

201
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,499
What?

202
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,968
Yeah, Donnie wants to get
into the grilled cheese business

203
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,936
before graduation.

204
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,939
So, you know, I don't know much,
but I do know this...

205
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,142
chicks don't dig
cheese. It's a fungus.

206
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,143
- (cell phone ringing)
- Just tell Donnie how you feel.

207
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:20,077
No!

208
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:21,478
(Zoey) Uh,
yeah, I'm outside.

209
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,649
No,
I'm not gonna walk to Starbucks.

210
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,050
Because it's raining!

211
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:29,420
I will see
you here. Thanks.

212
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,222
- Hi.
- What's up, cuz?

213
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,991
Hi. Oh, oh,
did you hear?

214
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,527
The closing act at
Front and Center this year

215
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,362
will be Lovelytheband.

216
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:40,464
- No way.
- Yeah, they just announced it.

217
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,598
My friend Liz
went last year.

218
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:42,666
She said it
was like totally lit.

219
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,102
I would kill
for wristbands,

220
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,438
but they sold out in
like two minutes, it's insane.

221
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:50,474
(phone chimes) Oh, wait.

222
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,377
(intense music)

223
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:06,557
(man vocalizing)

224
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,426
(music continues)

225
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,363
Okay, gotta go.
Uh, I'm coming, Kale.

226
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:15,999
My chaturanga
was unbelievable.

227
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,668
Oh, as always.

228
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:21,004
Kale.
Can't be his real name.

229
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,372
It's short for Kaleb, I think.

230
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:24,241
What does she even see
in the guy?

231
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:26,143
Are you kidding?

232
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,611
- What's up, Cam?
- (girl) Hey, Kale.

233
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,580
His name could be Catheter
and she'd still wanna date him.

234
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,381
Semantics, Michael.

235
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:33,417
Look, he'll be out of
the picture in no time.

236
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,086
- I have a plan.
- Oh, there's a shocker.

237
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,455
An insanely
great plan, bro.

238
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,057
I literally have no plan.

239
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,458
About Zoey?

240
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,193
No,
about Mr. Elmer.

241
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,395
I mean, how am I supposed to
write an essay in one weekend?

242
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:47,798
- It's unfair.
- Dude, seriously?

243
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:50,467
No, I'm 100% Team Elmer here.
Why don't you just finish it?

244
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,569
Well...
We're late for work.

245
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:54,438
You've been on it
for a year now.

246
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:56,173
You really need
to pull the trigger.

247
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,407
It's hard to get
her attention.

248
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:58,775
Her? Aren't we still
talking about Elmer?

249
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,544
No,
we're talking about Zoey.

250
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,046
Well, I don't know.
Here's a crazy idea.

251
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,482
Maybe you just walk
up to her in a heartfelt way,

252
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:07,417
say "I like you.
Do you like me?"

253
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,386
(popcorn kernels dropping)

254
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,722
"I like you, you like me?"
Really?

255
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,057
I can't say that.
She has a boyfriend.

256
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:20,130
(jazz music)

257
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,480
(Molly) I don't care what anyone
says, this still holds up.

258
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,781
- (Josh) Oh, totally.
- How many times do you think

259
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,416
we've seen this
movie since we were kids?

260
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,651
Probably like a million.

261
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,388
Okay, so would
Patrick J. Michaels

262
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:46,723
be afraid of his crush,
having a girlfriend?

263
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,759
No, no, he'd plant
his flag in the ground

264
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,494
and take a
beating in the name of love.

265
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,162
(man) Shut up!

266
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:53,664
Aren't you
supposed to be working?

267
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:55,065
Go back to sleep,
Jared!

268
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,402
(scoffs) Rude.

269
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,504
Mm,
mm-mm.

270
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,473
This part always
makes me nervous.

271
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:06,343
<i>I love you, Brittany.
I always have.</i>

272
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,744
<i>And I always will.
(fireworks whizzing)</i>

273
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:13,684
<i>♪ We only have tonight
my, my, my love... ♪</i>

274
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,686
(grunts)

275
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,321
The music,
the fireworks, I mean, that...

276
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,723
that is how a first
kiss is supposed to be.

277
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:20,757
- Mm-hmm.
- (sighs)

278
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,826
I so doubt she
was homeschooled.

279
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,761
(slurping)

280
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:26,763
Dude, come on.

281
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,532
One of us at
least has got to have

282
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:29,901
our
fireworks-on-the-dock moment.

283
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:30,767
You're right.

284
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,871
I need to be more like
Patrick J. freakin' Michaels.

285
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:35,639
- Yes, you do.
- Okay, I could play her

286
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,740
that mix that
I've been working on.

287
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:38,275
- Oh, that's such a good idea.
- Yeah.

288
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,443
I mean, high school's
almost over.

289
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:41,645
It's now or never,
Goosie.

290
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,548
(jazz music)

291
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,792
(boy on TV)
<i>It's Friday-Bye-Day,</i>

292
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:58,629
<i>and I'm very curious
what Zoey has to say.</i>

293
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:00,831
<i>Um, well, actually,
today's lunch would be</i>

294
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,834
<i>a literal
Friday-Bye-Day for me because..</i>

295
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,336
<i>(sighs)...
I am graduating early</i>

296
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,638
<i>and moving to Los Angeles.</i>

297
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,775
- <i>For reals?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

298
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,210
(bell dings)

299
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:17,247
(intense music)

300
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:20,918

so sad ♪

301
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,487

(record scratching effect)

303
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,927
- Josh?
- Josh?

304
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,765
L.A.! Can you believe it?

305
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:38,168
I really can't.
How about you, Josh?

306
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,404
Um,
when are you moving out?

307
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:43,373
Uh, I don't know.
Two or three...

308
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,776
- Weeks?
- Days, actually.

309
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,678
Yeah, I know, it all
happened like really fast.

310
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,680
Kale got a job
at an art gallery...

311
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:51,883
Well,
he's going too?

312
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,750
Yeah, yeah,
we are moving in together.

313
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:55,786
We'll see how that goes.

314
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:58,488
Wow, and Aunt Marie
is cool with that?

315
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,290
Uh, no, no,
not at all.

316
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:01,893
Phenomenal instincts,
that woman.

317
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,594
Well, it's not really
up to her, I'm 18.

318
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:05,997
If she can live with
her annoying boyfriend,

319
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,364
I can live with mine,
too.

320
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,967
Not that Kale is
annoying or anything.

321
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:12,536
Besides, maybe this is
like a good opportunity for me

322
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,271
to like further develop my art,
you know?

323
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,772
Your art?
What, what art?

324
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:18,642
I think it's a
bold move, cuz.

325
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:21,311
- Thank you.
- Okay.

326
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,548
Zoey, how do you know
you're not making a mistake?

327
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,516
Well, how do I know that I'm
not making the right decision?

328
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,318
'Cause it's a mistake!
(school bell rings)

329
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,454
Wow, you would really
get along well with my mom.

330
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:31,621
(girl) Hey,
Zoey. Come on.

331
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,557
Hey. Uh, I'll see
you later, guys.

332
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,624
I'll miss you.

333
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,495
That was good.
I like that.

334
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,297
Especially the
part where you tell her

335
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,531
that her dreams and
aspirations are a mistake.

336
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,735
(sighs)
Freakin' British people,

337
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:45,870
dude,
with their accents.

338
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,637
It's like their
superpower or something.

339
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:50,007
It's un... it's unfair.

340
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,443
Well...

341
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,678
(mimics British accent)
...there's not much to say.

342
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:56,747
(growls)

343
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,349
That's my in-between-the-knees
pillow, and I sleep in the nude.

344
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,953
What is wrong with you?

345
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,020
Nothing.
You should try it.

346
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:04,621
It's insanely breezy.

347
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,058
It's that redcoat Kale,
man.

348
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,825
He's a bad influence on her,
I'm telling you.

349
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,527
He's an artist, so now
she wants to be an artist?

350
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,828
Zoey's been into art
since she was a kid.

351
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,832
What is this?

352
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:18,502
Texas A&M?

353
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:21,471
The housing department?
You're leaving me, too?

354
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,640
No,
I'm not.

355
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,010
I just wanted optics,
but it's out of state, man.

356
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:27,711
I can't afford it.

357
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,981
And I can't just
move across the country

358
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,883
and abandon my brother.

359
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,451
It's been the
two of us for...

360
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:35,719
forever and...

361
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:38,355
(horn honking "La
Cucaracha" outside)

362
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:41,591
(tires screeching,
brakes whining)

363
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,659
You gotta be kidding me.

364
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:47,564
Check it out,
boys!

365
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:52,435
Don't say anything
about A&M.

366
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:54,304
Donnie, buddy!

367
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:56,640
Thought you
were gonna wait for me.

368
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,375
Yeah, well,
there was another buyer

369
00:15:58,408 --> 00:15:59,509
and,
you know, had to take it.

370
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,343
There was another buyer
for this.

371
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,979
Uh-huh, yeah, no.
She needs work.

372
00:16:02,013 --> 00:16:03,647
But trust me,
she's a gem.

373
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:06,951
Uh... you can fix that,
right?

374
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:08,752
So I'm
thinking about names.

375
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:14,091
The
Milleni-Yum Falcon. Y-U-M.

376
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:16,861
- (snickers)
- Right? Mm.

377
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,095
You can be Chewie.

378
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:19,329
I don't
want to be Chewie.

379
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,565
All right, I'm gonna let
you guys figure it out.

380
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:22,499
I gotta get to work.

381
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,903
Why wouldn't you
want to be Chewie?

382
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,704
Why wouldn't <i>you</i> want
to be Chewie?

383
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,907
'Cause I'm
the roguish one.

384
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:33,443
(Josh)
Maybe Mikey's right.

385
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,711
Maybe I
should just move on.

386
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:37,447
What? Heck no!

387
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,884
If you let this damsel that
you've been distressing over

388
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,652
leave before you have a chance
to profess your true feelings,

389
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:44,688
then, then you will
wind up a shell of man

390
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:46,991
forever haunted by
the cruel ghost of "what if."

391
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:48,692
But she's
leaving in two days.

392
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:51,095
(man on radio) <i>Who wants
wristbands to see Lovelytheband</i>

393
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,164
<i>at Front and Center?</i>

394
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:55,967
<i>That's right, Big Joe Henry
here giving away two wristbands</i>

395
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,068
<i>to the first caller.</i>

396
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,635
- <i>So call now.</i>
- Call!

397
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:00,704
Faster! Buttons,
push them!

398
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:03,908
- <i>And we have a winner.</i>
- Ahhh...

399
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,409
- <i>Congrats to Matt Baker.</i>
- Ohh!

400
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,979
<i>Cancel whatever you're doing
this weekend, Matt,</i>

401
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:10,047
<i>because you're
going to Front and Center.</i>

402
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:12,749
- Baker!
- Ugh!

403
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:15,086
Man,
Lovelytheband, front and center?

404
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,554
That would've
been a date to remember.

405
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,156
I mean, the romance
would have been off the charts.

406
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,725
Gah! It sucks for you.

407
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:26,496
(popcorn popping)

408
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,531
(fireworks exploding)

409
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,070
- Hello?
- Hey, dude, um...

410
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:36,673
my... my boss's
son has food poisoning,

411
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,576
something
about discount sushi.

412
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,145
Cool. Why don't you grab
a pen and the paper

413
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:42,812
and add that to the list
of things I don't care about?

414
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,081
He had three tickets
to Front and Center

415
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:46,217
- and he gave them to me.
- What?

416
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,685
- Get out.
- Yes, yes.

417
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,121
And if we leave by tonight,
we can make it

418
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,856
to Lovely by Sunday night,
we just need some wheels, bro.

419
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,591
- Yeah, leave that to me.
- Sweet.

420
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:56,626
And you just gotta help me
convince Zoey to come with us.

421
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,828
Dude,
no! Why? Why?

422
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,597
Price of admission.
Meet me in an hour.

423
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,966
You're the worst.

424
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,639
This is good.
This is really good.

425
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,676
Dude, that wasn't even
like a white lie,

426
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,712
that was like a
full-on Lance Armstrong.

427
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:17,081
This is bad.

428
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:19,150
Oh crap,
this is really bad.

429
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,184
I'm gonna cancel this
whole thing, what've done?

430
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:22,053
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, no, you can't do that.

431
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:25,957
Look, you set into
motion something big, okay?

432
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,858
Zoey's not gonna
say no to Lovelytheband,

433
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:29,860
and plus,
it's a road trip.

434
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:32,762
With friends,
just like in the movies.

435
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:33,730
When are we leaving?

436
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:36,100
We?

437
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:39,803
(cell phone vibrating)

438
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:47,912
Babe, do you think we should
exhibit this at the gallery,

439
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:49,981
or do you think
we should save it

440
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:51,715
for, like,
above our bed?

441
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:54,218
Babe?

442
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:57,121
Have you
seen my sketchbook?

443
00:18:57,955 --> 00:19:00,657
What is your jacket
doing on my sketchbook?

444
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,759
I like to take a peek
once in a while

445
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,128
and give some advice,
that's all.

446
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:05,662
But you know that I don't like
to show my stuff

447
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:07,664
- when it's not ready.
- I know you feel threatened

448
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,934
when you're
surrounded by real art.

449
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,535
But you can get to this level,
too, babe.

450
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,905
It just takes
time. I mean, look.

451
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:16,773
That piece there
took me nine years.

452
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:18,742
That one stripe
there took me a solid month.

453
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:21,711
Okay, can you just get over
yourself for a hot second?

454
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,614
I am sensing something
very awry in your aura.

455
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:27,852
Yes. Yes, my aura
is very awry.

456
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:30,321
We're not even close to
being ready to leave tomorrow.

457
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:32,589
And I don't know,
is the move too soon?

458
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:34,624
And, and maybe I should like,
look into local art programs

459
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:35,692
- or something...
- Ooh!

460
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,694
Artists don't need uni.

461
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:39,864
You don't learn art,
you...

462
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,933
- (sighs) You live it.
- You live it.

463
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,237
Look, do you think they could've
taught me that in school?

464
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:49,572
Hell to the no.

465
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,641
I was eating Frosted
Flakes one morning and then,

466
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:53,277
boom,
it hit me.

467
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,712
The Cereal
Killers collection.

468
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:04,155
Bedroom.

469
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:07,724
(♪♪♪)

470
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:10,660
(loud groan)

471
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,563
Okay...
(panting)

472
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,999
- Let's go!
- (whispers) Shh!

473
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:16,200
You're gonna
wake up your parents!

474
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,700
(whispers)
Oh, don't worry about them.

475
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:19,303
They're in Colombia
attending a symposium

476
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,105
on the
neuroscience of perception.

477
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,306
Then why
did you sneak out?

478
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:23,706
Oh, 'cause I've always
wanted to do that.

479
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,210
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

480
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:28,045
But I kind of like it now.

481
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,948
Oh, you are totally
not going to regret

482
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:32,615
me coming along.

483
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,985
Little known fact,
I'm an amazing wingman.

484
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,954
Woman. Wing woman.

485
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:40,157
(horn honking
"La Cucaracha")

486
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:46,596
What?
No way, for real?

487
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:51,235
The Milleni-Yum Falcon
at your service.

488
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:52,769
Dude, Donnie
let you take this?

489
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,039
Yeah! Yeah, I just left him
a nice little note

490
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:56,673
explaining
everything and we're cool.

491
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:59,210
Whoa, we're going
in this thing?

492
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,045
- Mm-hmm.
- Consider tone set.

493
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,947
- Hi, Molly.
- Hey.

494
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,950
I thought you only
had three wristbands.

495
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,187
Oh, I bought my own.
Yeah, months ago.

496
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:12,890
Dig me some Lovelytheband,
am I right?

497
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:16,227
Yeah, yeah. There's
nothing weird about that, so...

498
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,795
And I'm going to be documenting
the whole experience.

499
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:19,696
(camera clicking)

500
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,799
Hey, did you get
a hold of Zoey?

501
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,801
Yeah, man, she's on
her way right now.

502
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,103
She's gonna
confess her love for y...

503
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:27,404
No,
I haven't talked to her.

504
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:29,106
She was at Kale's
22 minutes ago.

505
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,077
You guys have
heard of social media, right?

506
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,012
It's a thing, yeah?

507
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,714
Good job, Molls.
All right, let's roll!

508
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,917
- (metal scraping)
- Gotcha!

509
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,885
(gasping)

510
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:43,354
And we're screwed.

511
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,924
"I borrowed the truck,

512
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:49,059
BRB next week."

513
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,263
How is next week "BRB"?

514
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:54,231
That was the nice note
you left him?

515
00:21:54,598 --> 00:21:55,866
Mikey,
we're supposed to be

516
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,201
working on the
truck all weekend.

517
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:00,803
Yeah, but Josh got wristbands
to Front and Center.

518
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:02,739
What?

519
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,775
Donnie, I'm sorry, bro,
we only have three wristbands.

520
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:06,977
I don't even think
Zoey's coming.

521
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:08,312
Donnie can just
use her wristband.

522
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,413
We haven't even
talked to her, man.

523
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:11,248
Semantics, Michael.

524
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:13,184
Okay, the semantics are
she's not going.

525
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:15,286
You're not going, you...
you're definitely not going.

526
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,022
No one's going in my
truck. Get out! Out, now!

527
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:19,890
I have an
extra wristband.

528
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:20,925
(bell dings)

529
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:25,362
Yep, yes,
I bought two

530
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:27,797
and I could sell
Donnie the extra wristband.

531
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,334
And who are you?

532
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,936
Oh, I'm sorry,
where are my manners?

533
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,938
My name's
Molly. Molly Jenkins.

534
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:36,106
Some would say a
wingman extraordinaire.

535
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,342
- Woman. Woman.
- Yeah, I got it, Molly Jenkins.

536
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,742
So how much
for the wristband?

537
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:42,012
How about
a Falcon ride's worth?

538
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:49,386
You know what's great
about Front and Center?

539
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,455
The music, but that's not
what you're going to say.

540
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:53,891
The food trucks, Mikey.
Food trucks

541
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:56,527
as far as the eye
can see. I'm in, I'm in.

542
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,362
(♪♪♪)

543
00:22:58,662 --> 00:22:59,964
- All right.
- See, I told you,

544
00:22:59,997 --> 00:23:01,899
I'm an amazing wingwoman.

545
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:04,969
(♪♪♪)

546
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:06,904
(engine sputtering)

547
00:23:06,937 --> 00:23:08,005
(tires screeching)

548
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:13,143
(Donnie) Wait,
wait, my bike!

549
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:15,246
We've been packing
for eight hours,

550
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,382
This is the perfect recipe
for a small mental breakdown.

551
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:21,185
Okay, well, maybe if
you would've helped me packed

552
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:23,220
instead of talking about
your stupid painting all night,

553
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:25,289
I would be less stressed.

554
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,057
Take that back.

555
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:30,060
(scoffs) You know what?

556
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:33,097
I will not let this
portal of negativity

557
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,199
enter my new LA flat.

558
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:37,067
It's called
an apartment, Kale.

559
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,269
(mock British accent)
We are not in London.

560
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:40,904
If I wanna be cultured
and call it a flat,

561
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:43,007
I will call it a
flat because it's flat!

562
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:48,212
You need to take a savasana,
work on your energy.

563
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:50,247
(cell phone ringing)

564
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:52,049
What!

565
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:55,886
What?

566
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,122
(Josh) Zoey, come on!

567
00:23:58,155 --> 00:23:59,123
Let's go! (music playing)

568
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:04,561
Zoey, come on!
Come on, let's go!

569
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:07,364
♪ Yeah, baby, I'll be there
Yeah, baby, I'll be there ♪

570
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:09,832
(♪♪♪)

571
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,001
We'll be
back in a few days.

572
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,436
But we committed
to hot springing

573
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,138
on the way to L.A.

574
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:16,473
Well, apparently I need
to work on my energy, so...

575
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:20,144
See you Monday.

576
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,513
Do schedules mean
nothing to you?

577
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:27,384
(♪♪♪)

578
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,428
Wow! Man,
you finally got it!

579
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:40,164
- This looks like a...
- Garbage can with paint.

580
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,299
Yeah, yeah, it does.

581
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,169
Hey, I can't believe you
got wristbands for this thing.

582
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:46,904
I know, trust me,
I can't believe it either.

583
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:48,372
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

584
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,139
Insane, right?

585
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,977
- Hi, I'm Zoey.
- I know.

586
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:55,979
I mean, I don't. I don't know,
because we've never met

587
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:57,014
and I've never
heard anything about you.

588
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,151
All right, guys ready?
Let's go.

589
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:02,319
All right.

590
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:04,154
(overlapping cheering)

591
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:09,059
(♪♪♪)

592
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:19,470
(♪♪♪)

593
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:23,607
(screaming)

594
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:30,581
(music stops, metal creaking)

595
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:34,952
(creaking continues)

596
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,366
Uh, thank you
for inviting me.

597
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,468
You know, I'm like
obsessed with Lovelytheband.

598
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:52,703
Oh, I know.

599
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:53,971
I've seen the
inside of your locker.

600
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:57,007
In passing.

601
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,219
(sighs, phone pings)

602
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:10,554
(phone swooshes)

603
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:18,362
(sighs)

604
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:24,234
(overlapping swooshes and beeps)

605
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:38,649
You know I can just switch
places with Molly if you want.

606
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:42,119
- No, no, no, no, it's...
- No! No!

607
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:45,355
No, I'm, um,
there's these puppies.

608
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,758
What's that?

609
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:50,494
Uh,
it's a sketchbook.

610
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,562
Cool,
what're you doing?

611
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:55,065
Sketching.

612
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,504
Um,
would you want to see?

613
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:03,674
Yeah,
is that cool?

614
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:06,543
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, cool.

615
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,448
This is amazing.

616
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:16,019
Like professional level amazing.

617
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,523
I had no clue
you were so talented.

618
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,695
I mean, what on earth...
(both laughing)

619
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,164
Oh, no, that's like,
that's a work in progress.

620
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:29,533
I don't normally show
people my stuff,

621
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,301
but if everyone reacts like you

622
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:32,669
then maybe I
have a shot in L.A., huh?

623
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,775
I mean, I think you
have a shot anywhere.

624
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,645
Doesn't have to be L.A.

625
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:43,413
You know,
the local college has

626
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:44,581
- a pretty good art program.
- No, no, no, no.

627
00:27:44,615 --> 00:27:47,284
You don't learn art,
you live it.

628
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:49,286
I mean, unless you're
Caravaggio or Da Vinci,

629
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,421
or any of the other
masters who've pretty much spent

630
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:54,224
their lives studying,
like, right out of the womb.

631
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,694
Or not.

632
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:04,234
You know, I'm not
doing it for him, right?

633
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:07,404
The whole move for Kale, it's
not like a chasing a guy thing.

634
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,339
That's not what this is about.

635
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:10,641
I didn't say you were.

636
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:12,242
I want to
become an artist.

637
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:17,681
I think you're
already an artist.

638
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:23,554
That's
really sweet of you.

639
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:26,256
(phone swooshes)

640
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:34,231
- Really, I'd be fine if we switched places.
- No! No, no, no.

641
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:35,365
- It's totally cool with me.
- Just, um...

642
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:38,669
(♪♪♪)

643
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:51,381
(♪♪♪)

644
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,722
(Josh) "How was your
high school experience?

645
00:29:06,296 --> 00:29:08,165
"Well, to be honest, I haven't
had many worth writing about.

646
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:13,270
But like I said,
high school isn't over yet."

647
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,138
(Mikey) Are we
planning on eating anytime soon?

648
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,441
(Zoey) We're getting
hangry. Pull over, dude.

649
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:19,343
(Molly)
Literally anywhere.

650
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:21,144
(barkers shouting)

651
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,512
Here you go.

652
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,619
Carnival food
for breakfast, great.

653
00:29:28,652 --> 00:29:29,720
Corn dogs are
breakfast food.

654
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:31,121
It's like
pancakes and sausage.

655
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,590
Hey, hey, hey,
okay, so,

656
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:35,359
I found a guy
with wristbands.

657
00:29:35,392 --> 00:29:37,294
What? Molls,
you're incredible.

658
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:39,429
Are you serious?

659
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:41,365
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

660
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:42,466
So, where do we
meet this guy of yours?

661
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:44,635
The Motel Mermaid.

662
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:47,939
You know,
it's close to the festival.

663
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:49,740
I think we'd be
idiots if we didn't stay there.

664
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:51,174
Looks cheap. I'm in.

665
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:55,345
Hey, Molly, you want to like,
hit the ring toss or something?

666
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,547
- Scope out the carnies?
- Love me some carnie scoping.

667
00:29:57,581 --> 00:29:58,715
All right.

668
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:03,220
Now, see, that is why I
never joined varsity anything.

669
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,889
Although there was
like a hot second when I was

670
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:06,323
on the cheer squad
'cause of the cute outfits.

671
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:07,791
(laughing)

672
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:10,327
Uh, so,
home school? What's that like?

673
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:12,529
Uh, it's rigorous work, yeah.

674
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,197
Wake up at 4:00
a.m. every morning,

675
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,867
and I milk the cows,

676
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,235
I churn the butter,
et cetera, et cetera.

677
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:21,505
Okay. So, so, so what're you
gonna do after high school?

678
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:23,273
You gonna like,
reject the system,

679
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:24,574
build a community garden,
all that?

680
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:26,243
Yeah, no, totally.
Yeah, I mean,

681
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:27,544
the parents might
not be for that idea.

682
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,546
But me? Phew. (laughs)

683
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,648
No, actually I'm probably just
gonna go to the local college,

684
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:33,684
my dad teaches there,
and major in psychology.

685
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:36,386
Wow, that's actually
really cool.

686
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,355
You are full of surprises.

687
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:41,458

690
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:47,798
- No...
- None whatsoever...

691
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:49,433
(overlapping chatter, laughter)

692
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:51,234
- We suck at this.
- We do.

693
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,303
Although, we're doing
much better than they are.

694
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:56,606
(Molly) Ah, yeah.

695
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,742
- They need some help.
- Okay, so are you related

696
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,811
to them on their
mom's side or their dad's side?

697
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:03,346
Uh, Mom's, thank god.

698
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,682
- Dad was a creeper.
- I heard.

699
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:07,684
Did he really run
off with that woman

700
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:09,020
right after the
mom passed away?

701
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:11,856
I mean, that's,
that's messed up.

702
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:13,490
Yeah, no, he did.

703
00:31:13,724 --> 00:31:14,892
How did you
know about that?

704
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:15,993
Oh,
I heard it from Josh.

705
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,795
Oh yeah, Josh and I,
we tell each other everything.

706
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:21,999
Sometimes he tells me too much,
quite frankly, you know?

707
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,768
- Darts?
- Darts.

708
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,838
(bell dings)

709
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:28,638
Did she see?

710
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,676
Yeah, man, she just
canceled the move.

711
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:35,312
All right, let me take
a whack at it.

712
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:36,948
And after this, we
gotta hit the road, that wa...

713
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:39,382
(truck pulling away)

714
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:42,920
Ohh...

If he could marry that
food truck, he would.

719
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:52,562
Bro, at some point,
you're gonna have to tell him

720
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:54,932
- how you feel.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

721
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:57,267
Soon as you tell Zoey
how you feel, I'll tell Donnie.

722

Everyone that's been
passing through here

723
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:02,539

Oh, hey.

726
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:06,576
Hey, Zoey, can I
give it a shot?

727
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,479
Oh, I didn't know
the lady was spoken for.

728
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,015
- Oh, no.
- Oh, we're not...

729
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:12,049
Hey there, mister, you know
what'd be great?

730
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,416
Is getting this
man some darts.

731
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:17,554
- Three tries.
- Okay.

732
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:23,727
- That was terrible.
- It was my first try.

733
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,762
- Excuse you.
- Excuse me? Uh...

734
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,666
You, uh, you ain't from
around here, are you?

735

Uh,

interested, okay?

No, no, no, no...

839
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:22,685
- What?
- 'Cause people

840
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,421
usually get
offended when I do it.

841
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,457
For example,
I read my Aunt Belle once,

842
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,392
and it kind of
ruined Thanksgiving.

843
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:30,027
She threw a 40 at me.

844
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,129

by the way.

845
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:33,464
But it was after I
told her that alcohol

846
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:35,866
was negatively
affecting her life, so whatever.

847
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,903
Oh now, come on,
now you gotta read me.

848
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:42,039
Psychoanalyze me until I cry.

849
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:44,475
- (nervous chuckles)
- Okay. But, um...

850
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:46,776
Don't say I... I
didn't warn you.

851
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:47,378

853
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:55,319
You market yourself like
this extroverted dream girl,

854
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:57,154
but deep down,
you're sick of it,

855
00:38:57,188 --> 00:38:59,423
the people calling
you beautiful because

856
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:02,059
you know they're just
talking about the surface and...

857
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:05,229
Like every girl ever, there's
so much more to you than that.

858
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:09,066
But you don't advertise your
real talents, like your art.

859
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,202
And maybe it's because it's
on a brand or you're afraid that

860
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:13,736
people won't like your work,
which will leave you feeling unappreciated.

861
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,207
So instead, you fill that void
with superficial relationships

862
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,375
with older,
seemingly self-assured guys.

863
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:20,010
And you know
this isn't healthy,

864
00:39:20,044 --> 00:39:21,946
but you tell yourself
it's whatever, because

865
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,480
at the end of the day, you're
aware that you're doing it.

866
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:25,416
But soon, you're
gonna find yourself stuck living

867
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,151
under the cloud of
someone else's dream,

868
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:28,919
convincing yourself to do things
that you never wanted to do

869
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:30,753
in the first place,
like move in with Kale.

870
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:38,395
Or not. Sorry, uh...

871
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,464
Half the time, I don't
know what I'm talking about.

872
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,934
It's a good thing
I don't have a 40.

873
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:44,902
(nervous chuckle)

874
00:39:44,935 --> 00:39:46,337
Okay...

875
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:50,874
All right,
you gotta give me something.

876
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:52,142
Preferably a long
list of your screw-ups

877
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:53,877
so I don't feel
bad about myself.

878
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:57,814
Well, I don't have much
in terms of dating.

879
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:01,485
Uh, and by not much,
I mean, like nonexistent.

880
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:03,454
I've never
even kissed a guy.

881
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:05,990
Oh, shut up.

882
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,926
What? Why? Why?

883
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:11,028
Uh, I just...

884
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:17,401
Okay, I... I think
a first kiss should...

885
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:19,069
- should be kind of a big deal.
- Okay

886
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:21,505
And I want the whole shebang,
you know?

887
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:24,341
Like,
like I want a romantic setting,

888
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:27,945
underneath the stars,
and a twinkle in my eye

889
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:30,447
that signals that
we're supposed to kiss and...

890
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,250
and then
magical fireworks explode.

891
00:40:35,252 --> 00:40:36,487
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

892
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:39,957
Okay, well, now
it's my turn to read you.

893
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,260
You overthink things.
With the right guy,

894
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:45,296
it's not like, about all
the fireworks and stuff.

895
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:49,199
Um, turn.

896
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:51,535
But you and Josh,
you guys seem super close.

897
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:53,137
- (laughing)
- What?

898
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,873
- No, no, no.
- What?

899
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:57,541
Not that there's
anything wrong with Josh,

900
00:40:57,574 --> 00:40:59,343
because he, he is great.

901
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,312
And, you know,
now that I think about it,

902
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,180
he's kind of cute,
right?

903
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,416
And I mean, ooh, you
should see him at matinee time.

904
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:07,584
Woof. Can't keep
those geriatrics off of him,

905
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:08,585
if you know
what I'm sayin'?

906
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:12,856
- Yeah, Josh is sweet.
- Yeah.

907
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,160
(♪♪♪)

908
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:18,996
Where did you find this place?
Did you know this was happening?

909
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:20,497
I did not.
(cell phone beeps)

910
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:29,073

911
00:41:29,473 --> 00:41:30,574

913
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,388
Oh, hey, okay,
so, wristband...

914
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:46,156
What?

915
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:48,959
Uh,
nothing.

916
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:51,628
It's too much, right?
Like this, this hair thing,

917
00:41:51,662 --> 00:41:54,331
- and the sparkles...
- No, no, it's...

918
00:41:54,365 --> 00:41:55,265
It's nice.

919
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,603
- Um, the wristbands.
- Yes, all right.

920
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:02,072
So he is going to
text me when he gets here.

921
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:03,173
I think you should
give me the money now

922
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:05,109
that way you can just like,
focus.

923
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:07,177
Yeah. These are my savings.
Where'd you meet this guy?

924
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:08,946
- Oh, Craigslist.
- Craigslist?

925
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:11,548
- What're we waiting for?
- Let's go party!

926

Mikey, Mikey, I found
my tribe, I found 'em.

930
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,352
Whoa, Alcoholics Anonymous.
Maybe chill out on the drinks

931
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:50,120
'cause I can smell
you from like a mile away.

932
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:52,990
(chuckles)

933
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:54,691
This is my baby brother.

934
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:57,594
I took care of him,
and now he's taking care of me.

935
00:42:57,628 --> 00:42:59,563
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

936
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:03,534
Oh, guys, something
pretty awesome happened.

937
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,335
We are now members,

938
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,304
boom,
of the FTG.

939
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:10,340
What's, what's
the Food Truck Guild?

940
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:12,476
Uh, the greatest thing
in the world

941
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,711
if you drive a food truck,
yeah.

942
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,747
Luca hooked it up,
we're basically <i>familia</i> now.

943
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,148
We're in.

944
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:20,050
Y... you paid
money for this?

945
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,052
Uh, yeah,
you bet I did.

946
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:23,287
It's gonna
pay off in spades.

947
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:27,524
We're celebrating.
It's a celebration.

948
00:43:28,325 --> 00:43:30,027
Celebration!

949
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,695
- Hey.
- Hey!

950
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,231
I'm Donnie.

951
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:36,533
I'm screwed.

952
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:40,070
Hey, Zoey,
uh...

953
00:43:40,103 --> 00:43:41,238
(girl) Zoey,
you made it!

954
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,006
Oh my God, hey!
Liz, how are you?

955
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,374
I'm with Hunter
and Nick, say hi!

956
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:46,743
Uh,
hold on, I'll be back.

957
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,147
Hey,
hey.

958
00:43:51,014 --> 00:43:54,384
She's not here with them,
she's here with you.

959
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:56,253
And I have some
inside information for you.

960
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:58,255
(whispering) She's
ignoring Kale's calls.

961
00:43:58,288 --> 00:43:59,590
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

962
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:01,592
You're in the game,
buddy. You're in the game.

963
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,427
Yes, okay.

964
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:06,029
I just gotta get
her attention somehow.

965
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:08,499
You girls down, huh?
You wanna?

966
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:10,667
No.
Have a good night.

967
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:15,205
All right, yep,
you too.

968
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:18,108
Read the room,
man.

969
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:20,410
Not everyone is as passionate
about food trucks as you are.

970
00:44:20,711 --> 00:44:22,646
Are you not passionate about the food
truck? Is that what you're saying?

971
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:24,515
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

972
00:44:24,548 --> 00:44:25,716
It sounded like that's
what you're saying.

973
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:28,051
Do you hear yourself
when you talk?

974
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:29,520
"Hey, let me show you my
truck out in the parking lot."

975
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:31,588
That sounds like
you might abduct them.

976
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:35,792
Yeah, no,
I see that.

977
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:38,095
The night's still young,
there's plenty of girls.

978
00:44:38,128 --> 00:44:39,763
Uh,
no more food trucks.

979
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:41,231
No more food trucks,
perfect.

980
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:42,599
No more food trucks,
no more food trucks.

981
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:45,469
Just talk to them about,
uh, science and culture...

982
00:44:45,502 --> 00:44:50,340
(♪♪♪)

983
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:51,675
(Josh) I'll just go over
there and ask her to dance.

984
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:54,044
People still like to dance,
right?

985
00:44:54,244 --> 00:44:55,812
People love that stuff.

986
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,615
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

987
00:44:58,649 --> 00:45:00,851

Ohh! Yeah,

996
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:18,535
He's walking. It's fine,
let's go.

997
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:19,369
I have a DJ!

998
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:22,539
- This is a bad idea.
- No, no, no,

999
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:23,707
- you can figure it out.
- He said it's pre-recorded,

1000
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,375
these are all
just backtracks.

1001
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:26,610
- I do not know what that means.
- These are just fragments

1002
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:29,313
pre-recorded to
play while he runs his set.

1003
00:45:29,346 --> 00:45:30,581
Look,
that's even better.

1004
00:45:30,614 --> 00:45:32,449
No, no, the opposite
of better, no bueno.

1005
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:34,651
Look, this is gonna take
me forever to mute or sync.

1006
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,654

you were that talented.

1060
00:49:49,773 --> 00:49:53,510
It was this
100-piece art set.

1061
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:57,982
It was like, a pretty souped
up gift for ten-year-old me.

1062

You know the ones
that fold open like suitcases?

Art was never really
my thing.

1064
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:07,859
My drawings tended to
look like Rorschach tests.

What's a Rorschach
test?

1066
00:50:09,526 --> 00:50:11,929
You know, like,
the ink blot thing.

1067
00:50:11,963 --> 00:50:13,965
Like in the interrogation
scene of "Teen Genius."

1068
00:50:15,832 --> 00:50:17,400
Not an '80s movie fan?

1069

No, I mean,
I kind of am, yeah...

- Who?

1071
00:50:21,906 --> 00:50:23,707
Patrick J. Michaels?

1072
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:26,110
- No? No?
- No...

1073
00:50:26,143 --> 00:50:28,478

Where did that come from?

1079
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:41,125
You know how you don't like
to show anyone your art?

1080
00:50:45,162 --> 00:50:48,165
Well,
I'm must say,

1081
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:49,766
I'm very glad that
you finally shared it.

1082
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:52,169
You were great.

1083
00:50:52,203 --> 00:50:54,105

Yes, totally.

1090
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:12,689
It's a DJ
Obie-D2 original.

1091
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:16,459
Yeah.

1092
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:17,627

1095
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,608
You're a good dancer.

1096
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,546
Sorry, I didn't mean to like,
scare you or anything,

1097
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:38,515
I just saw you out on the dance
floor and I wanted to, like,

1098
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,151
come over and say hi.

1099
00:51:40,985 --> 00:51:41,919
I'm Sebastian.

And don't you forget it.

1103
00:51:52,729 --> 00:51:53,630

1105
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:57,134
Where you from,
Molly Jenkins?

1106
00:51:57,168 --> 00:51:58,835
Oh, well, I mean,
I could tell you,

1107
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:00,804
but like,
do you honestly care?

1108
00:52:00,837 --> 00:52:02,672
You have a funny way
of flirting, Molly Jenkins.

1109
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:05,775
- (laughing)
- What? Do I?

1110
00:52:06,277 --> 00:52:08,678
Flir... flirt? I... no,
no,

1111
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:10,714
I... I do not flirt,
sir.

1112
00:52:10,747 --> 00:52:12,682

I... whew! It is...

1113
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:15,585

1114
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:18,990
Almost... hot... hot,
not like hot, like like "hot."

1115
00:52:19,023 --> 00:52:20,657
Like, just... I'm
sorry. It's like, above

1116

temperature in this place.

why don't, um, I don't know,

1118
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:28,531

with some of my friends?

1119
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:30,234
They're just like hanging out,
listening to music,

1120
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:33,004
and, uh,
there's air conditioning.

1121
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:34,504
Uh...

1122
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:40,277
Yeah. Yeah, sure,
why not?

1123
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:41,745
- Let's go.
- Okay, cool.

1124
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:50,787
- What are you doing?
- You broke my heart.

1125
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,123
You betrayed me,
Fredo!

1126
00:52:52,156 --> 00:52:54,191
Okay,
we've reached the

1128

his name was Mikey.

00:52:58,628 --> 00:53:00,031
Okay,
is it your goal for the night

1131
00:53:00,064 --> 00:53:01,165
to scare every
single girl away?

1132
00:53:01,198 --> 00:53:03,100
We dreamt
the food truck.

1133
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,869
That was our dream,
Mikey!

1134
00:53:04,902 --> 00:53:06,770
- What are you talking about?
- You! You!

1135
00:53:06,803 --> 00:53:09,106
You're thinking you're so smart
all the time and you're not.

1136
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,607
You know what you are?

1137
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,708
- What?
- Stupid.

1138
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:13,244
Oh, I'm stupid?
Oh, sick burn.

1139
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:15,712
You know what's stupid?
The Milleni-Yum Falcon.

1140

00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:50,327
Uh, his name
is Dr. SpaceCakes.

1204
00:56:53,864 --> 00:56:54,932
Oh...

1205
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:56,100
That's our guy.

1206
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:03,274
(man) Hey, I got your stuff,
you got the money?

1207
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:06,210
You mean the wristbands?
How old are you?

1208
00:57:06,243 --> 00:57:07,344
Here you are, sir.

1209
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:10,847
(sirens wailing)

1210
00:57:10,881 --> 00:57:13,117
- Hands where I can see 'em!
- They're offering me drugs!

1211
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,485
(officer) All right,
you two just stay right there...

1212
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,120
Should we... run?

1213
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:18,322
That's a bad idea.

1214
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:24,094
(birds chirping)

1215
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:26,030
(cell phone ringing)

1216
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:30,301
(phone swooshing)

1217
00:57:36,507 --> 00:57:40,810
(knocking on door)

1218
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:43,113
Okay, relax, Josh,
I'm coming.

1219
00:57:43,614 --> 00:57:46,216
Hello, babe.
I've called you nonstop.

1220
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,951
Did, uh,
did your phone break?

1221
00:57:47,985 --> 00:57:50,254
I, um...

1222
00:57:50,287 --> 00:57:53,891
(stammering) No, uh, yeah,
the service is like super shoddy here.

1223
00:57:53,924 --> 00:57:55,092
Well,
what are you doing here?

1224
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:57,261
Well, I saw you
on Liz's Snap,

1225
00:57:57,294 --> 00:57:59,596
so I dialed her up,
grabbed the first

1226
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:03,000
puddle jumper I could find,
and wham, voilà, here I am.

1227
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,569
Here you are.

1228
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:08,205
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day.

1229
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:10,541
I... I let my
chakras red line.

1230
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:13,210
Please, forgive me.

1231
00:58:18,982 --> 00:58:20,084
Come on.

1232
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:22,319
(both) Namaste.

1233
00:58:22,353 --> 00:58:23,654
And we're back.

1234
00:58:23,687 --> 00:58:25,489
You know you're
the paint to my brush.

1235
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,925
Okay, you just gotta stop
saying things like that.

1236
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,626
No, I'm sorry,
I'm an artist.

1237
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,228
I just think in pictures,
all right?

1238
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,197
I'm like a
turtle in a race car.

1239
00:58:34,098 --> 00:58:38,001
Never mind, I come
bearing gifts of great news.

1240
00:58:38,035 --> 00:58:39,937
Got a little hook
up from my compadre.

1241
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:41,638
- Hey.
- VIP wristbands

1242
00:58:41,672 --> 00:58:43,907
- to Front and Center.
- Look at that.

1243
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,342
And that's
not even the best part.

1244
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:47,578
Right now,
all your earthly possessions

1245
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:50,581
are boxed up on a little
freight train to Los Angeles.

1246
00:58:50,814 --> 00:58:52,950
I'm sorry, my possessions
are on a train to where?

1247
00:58:52,983 --> 00:58:54,385
Home, babe.

1248
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:56,920
They're on their way
home to the City of Angels.

1249
00:58:57,688 --> 00:58:59,456
Hey, have you seen...

1250
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:01,492
Kale? Um...

1251
00:59:02,726 --> 00:59:04,027
W... when did you get here?

1252
00:59:04,061 --> 00:59:05,462
Uh, just now, Joshypoo,
and yes,

1253
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:07,030
delighted to see you,
as well.

1254
00:59:07,698 --> 00:59:10,134
- Um, where's Molly?
- I don't know,

1255
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:12,002
she's probably still
with that guy from last night.

1256
00:59:12,403 --> 00:59:13,971
- What?
- Oh, it's okay.

1257
00:59:14,004 --> 00:59:16,173
Calm down, I... I'm
sure she'll be back soon.

1258
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:17,040
Why didn't you tell me
she didn't come back?

1259
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:20,043
We need to find her.

1260
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,212
Okay.

1261
00:59:22,246 --> 00:59:23,680
Intense
little bloke, no?

1262
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:30,387
(♪♪♪)

1263
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,360
Whoa, Kale.

1264
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:37,694
- Was not expecting that.
- Why is everybody

1265
00:59:37,728 --> 00:59:39,363
so surprised to see me?

1266
00:59:39,396 --> 00:59:41,632
You do realize that
Zoey is my girlfriend, right?

1267
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,134
That would imply
that we hang out a lot.

1268
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:45,369
Just didn't know that you
were coming here, that's all.

1269
00:59:45,402 --> 00:59:46,737
Yeah, well, maybe if
you'd answer my calls.

1270
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,238
- Okay.
- Molly's missing.

1271
00:59:48,272 --> 00:59:49,473
Missing what?

1272
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:51,475
She didn't get
to her room last night.

1273
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,610
Okay, we need to split up
and start knocking on doors.

1274
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:56,413
Yeah, you, uh, you wanna
check the parking lot

1275
00:59:56,447 --> 00:59:58,682
and I'll check the...

1276
00:59:58,715 --> 01:00:01,118
Great, we're still in
the silent treatment, good.

1277
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,019
I forgot we were eight.

1278
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,655
Do we make a
better couple than you?

1279
01:00:07,257 --> 01:00:09,026
Why is everyone
so intense here?

1280
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:12,629
(Molly) I know my rights,
sir, okay?

1281
01:00:12,663 --> 01:00:14,465
And I took AP law.

1282
01:00:14,498 --> 01:00:17,000
I have watched a
lot of lawyer shows,

1283
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:18,302
and I get a phone call.

1284
01:00:21,104 --> 01:00:22,706
You're something,
Molly Jenkins.

1285
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:26,643
Wow, you really love using
my full name, don't you?

1286
01:00:26,677 --> 01:00:29,580
Well, I mean, it's a...
it's a beautiful name.

1287
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,082
- Really?
- Don't sue me for it, though,

1288
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:34,218
'cause I think you'd win.

1289
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:38,088
- (laughs)
- Th... that was funny, um...

1290
01:00:38,689 --> 01:00:41,158
Ugh,
has anyone ever told you that

1291
01:00:41,191 --> 01:00:43,660
- you look exactly like...
- Patrick J. Michaels?

1292
01:00:43,694 --> 01:00:46,430
- Yes!
- Yeah, get it all the time.

1293
01:00:46,865 --> 01:00:48,265
I don't see the resemblance,
though.

1294
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:52,302
Really? Like... like really?

1295
01:00:52,503 --> 01:00:54,438
- No.
- I mean, you look

1296
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:58,275
- exactly like him.
- Nope, don't see it at all.

1297
01:00:58,308 --> 01:00:59,810
My mom was like a
huge fan of his, though.

1298
01:00:59,843 --> 01:01:01,745
Was an extra in like,
all of his movies.

1299
01:01:01,778 --> 01:01:04,715
<i>All right, you two,
I got some news for you.</i>

1300
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:07,317
<i>We got a call from
one of our other stations.</i>

1301
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:09,520
<i>They arrested an
Addison Preston Roberts,</i>

1302
01:01:09,553 --> 01:01:11,688
<i>AKA Dr. SpaceCakes.</i>

1303
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:13,357
<i>You're gonna be
good to go here soon.</i>

1304
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:15,225
Told you he was real.

1305
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:17,194
<i>Well,
what do you know?</i>

1306
01:01:17,227 --> 01:01:19,096
<i>Even cops can
be wrong sometimes.</i>

1307
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:23,233
Would you relax?
Zoey's right.

1308
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:25,168
Molly probably just
hooked up with that dude.

1309
01:01:25,202 --> 01:01:27,771
Oh, speaking of, you and Zoey
were pretty close last night.

1310
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:29,573
Like, so close, she
should have pepper sprayed you.

1311
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:31,441
What did you do?
What did you... did you...

1312
01:01:33,343 --> 01:01:34,578
Okay, the fact that
I'm having to pry you

1313
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:36,446
for information right
now is freaking me out.

1314
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,781
Did you guys
hook up or not?

1315
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:40,784
I mean, we didn't...
we didn't "hook up" hook up.

1316
01:01:40,817 --> 01:01:43,086
We had an
emotional hookup.

1317
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,656
I mean,
I... I played her my mix and...

1318
01:01:45,689 --> 01:01:47,324
You finally played her
that thing and she was into it?

1319
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:49,626
Yeah, dude, she...
she loved it.

1320
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,228
Wow.
(phone rings)

1321
01:01:51,261 --> 01:01:53,430
Molly? Molly?

1322
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:56,199
Hey, are you okay?
Where are you?

1323
01:01:57,501 --> 01:02:00,237
Where?
Yes, we're coming right now.

1324
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,338
All right.

1325
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,611
(♪♪♪)

1326
01:02:09,914 --> 01:02:11,715
Just a misunderstanding.

1327
01:02:11,748 --> 01:02:13,584
Okay, we gotta get her.

1328
01:02:13,617 --> 01:02:16,720
Okay, so we have to go get
our friend from jail.

1329
01:02:16,753 --> 01:02:18,622
Wow, you guys
must've had a wild night.

1330
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:20,591
Are you coming or not?

1331
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:25,829
(♪♪♪)

1332
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:39,576
(♪♪♪)

1333
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:06,637
You okay?

1334
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,872
Oh,
I... I'm fine.

1335
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:09,673
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1336
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,808
No teardrop tattoos,
that's a good sign.

1337
01:03:11,842 --> 01:03:13,243
Yeah, no,
it's all good.

1338
01:03:13,276 --> 01:03:16,780
I was imprisoned
for another man's crime.

1339
01:03:16,813 --> 01:03:18,515
I'll give you the
CliffNotes version.

1340
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:21,852
I was meeting a
friend who happened to have

1341
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:24,554
narcotics on him,
and I basically unwittingly

1342
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:26,423
ended up stepping
in on a sting operation

1343
01:03:26,456 --> 01:03:29,393
and the perp got away,
so they arrested us.

1344
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:31,395
Us?

1345
01:03:31,662 --> 01:03:33,697
(door opening)

1346
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,432
Thank you, officer.
I appreciate it.

1347
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:37,935
We are all set,
completely good to go.

1348
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:39,436
Ooh! Hi,
nice to meet you guys.

1349
01:03:39,469 --> 01:03:41,939
I've heard a lot about you.

1350
01:03:41,973 --> 01:03:43,573
Thank you, by the way, for
the ride to Front and Center,

1351
01:03:43,607 --> 01:03:44,841
I don't know
what I would've done.

1352
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:46,376
Appreciate it, thanks.

1353
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:47,644
This is my Sebastian.

1354
01:03:47,879 --> 01:03:50,380
(laughs nervously) Sorry, sorry!

1355
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,450
My friend who's named Sebastian,
you're not mine....

1356
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:54,851
You would think after
12 hours straight together

1357
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:55,920
she'd be a little less
tongue tied around me.

1358
01:03:55,953 --> 01:03:59,891
I am not tongue tied,
I just, I just talk a lot.

1359
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:01,425
I think it's cute.

1360
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:02,793
I think it's
completely adorable.

1361
01:04:02,826 --> 01:04:05,897
I mean, hey, who
knew jail could be like, fun?

1362
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,667
Hmm?

1363
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:12,536
Is that Kale?

1364
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:15,539
Yes, it is Kale, again!

1365
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:18,241
Zoey, we can we please go?
It's already half past the hour.

1366
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:19,810
Actually, he's right, we
should probably go to Front

1367
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:22,013
and Center 'cause that's what
we traveled all the way for.

1368
01:04:22,046 --> 01:04:23,714
I'm gonna do
that. I'm gonna go.

1369
01:04:26,984 --> 01:04:28,819
"Half past the hour."
What are you like 50?

1370
01:04:28,852 --> 01:04:30,520
- We have a little bit of an issue.
- Yeah, I'll say.

1371
01:04:30,554 --> 01:04:31,923
Don't worry,
I'll get rid of him.

1372
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:35,459
What? No, no, no.
I didn't get the wristbands.

1373
01:04:35,492 --> 01:04:37,028
The scalper
took all of your money.

1374
01:04:37,061 --> 01:04:39,496
- Are you kidding me?
- It's gonna be fine, okay?

1375
01:04:39,529 --> 01:04:40,998
Because Sebastian
actually knows people

1376
01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:42,867
that work at the festival,
so we should be good.

1377
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,569
Great, great, our only chance
is a convicted felon, lovely.

1378
01:04:45,602 --> 01:04:47,571
Okay, I mean, we're not
technically convicted,

1379
01:04:47,604 --> 01:04:50,007
so like, let's not make
this worse than what it was.

1380
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,309
Hey, doesn't he look exactly
like Patrick J. Michaels?

1381
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:54,377
He looks nothing like
Patrick J. Michaels.

1382
01:05:00,717 --> 01:05:05,622

So plan A is like,
dental school,

but plan B is
the rap game.

1394
01:06:02,013 --> 01:06:04,548
Oh, that's...
that's a choice.

1395
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:06,750
I mean, I think
it's a strong second choice.

1396
01:06:06,783 --> 01:06:08,552
- You've gotta have options.
- Yeah, I mean,

1397

third choices
are good to... hi!

Molls,
we're getting close.

1399
01:06:11,956 --> 01:06:13,858
If he can't get us there,
let's just chuck him out.

1400
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:15,759
Chuck him out?
What is wrong?

1401
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:18,095
Just chill, all right?
Focus on you-know-who.

- Don't you do it! Don't do it!

1404
01:06:28,705 --> 01:06:30,807
Mikey, Donnie,
stop it.

1405
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:33,144
Yeah, guys,
come on, stop.

1406
01:06:33,177 --> 01:06:34,912
You're always agreeing
with my girl, huh?

1407
01:06:34,946 --> 01:06:36,479
What is that
supposed to mean?

1408
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:38,582
- It means tha...
- It means

1409
01:06:38,615 --> 01:06:39,984
we should all
do a sing-a-long.

1410
01:06:40,017 --> 01:06:41,618
Am I right?
Not you, Sebastian.

1411
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:44,588

1414
01:06:55,066 --> 01:06:57,767
- Poor guy.
- Oh, is that a beak?

1415
01:06:57,801 --> 01:06:59,736
Yeah, I think that's
a huge ass bird.

1416
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:01,471
You happy?
You killed Big Bird.

1417
01:07:01,504 --> 01:07:03,406
- Nope, it's your fault.
- I've had enough.

1418
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,109
I'm calling a Lyft.
Zoey, pack up your things.

1419
01:07:05,142 --> 01:07:06,944
Oh, are you sure you don't
wanna pack them up for me?

1420
01:07:06,978 --> 01:07:08,913
- 'Cause you're so good at it.
- Adorable.

1421
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:11,148
- Do you have your wristband?
- No, Josh has them.

1422
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:14,051
Well, come on, chop-chop,
little man, wristband.

1423
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:16,988
- The engine's screwed.
- I can fix it, like I always do.

1424
01:07:17,021 --> 01:07:19,723
- Don't touch my truck.
- What is your deal, man?

1425

(♪♪♪)

1426
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,834
I can explain, Donnie.

1427
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:33,104
No, no, I know, I know,
'cause you explain everything.

1428
01:07:34,238 --> 01:07:35,572
How about this,
can you explain

1429
01:07:35,605 --> 01:07:37,875
what it's like to
be a kid one day

1430
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:39,944
and then suddenly you
wake up and you're a parent?

1431
01:07:42,947 --> 01:07:44,081
Good luck fixing the truck.

1432
01:07:44,115 --> 01:07:45,682
I spent all our
money on the FTG

1433
01:07:45,715 --> 01:07:47,118
because I thought
this was our dream.

1434
01:07:47,617 --> 01:07:49,220
Look, I... I could
sell my wristband

1435
01:07:49,253 --> 01:07:51,688
to pay for the
damages. Donnie!

1436
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:54,025
Josh,
I'm gonna need my wristband.

1437
01:07:54,058 --> 01:07:55,159
(Kale) Yeah...

1438
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:57,995
Where are the wristbands?

1439
01:07:58,029 --> 01:07:59,562
(Josh) I...

1440
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:01,899
I don't know.

1441
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:03,868
What do you mean
you don't know?

1442
01:08:03,901 --> 01:08:05,568
- They're at will call.
- Well...

1443
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:07,171
But there's no will call
at Front and Center.

1444
01:08:07,204 --> 01:08:08,873
Hold on, I thought you said
you picked them up from like,

1445
01:08:08,906 --> 01:08:11,008
a Dr. SpaceCakes?

1446
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,709
(nervous chuckle)

1447
01:08:12,742 --> 01:08:14,511
- Wait, didn't your boss give them to you?
- Yeah.

1448
01:08:16,746 --> 01:08:17,915
Josh?

1449
01:08:17,949 --> 01:08:20,483
Look,
I can explain.

1450
01:08:24,288 --> 01:08:26,823
I lied, I never had
any wristbands, guys.

1451
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:28,159
- Wait, what?
- I knew it!

1452
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:29,726
(Mikey) Wow,
that took a turn.

1453
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,029
- Screw us, right?
- Mikey, Mikey...

1454
01:08:32,063 --> 01:08:34,198
- Look, it was my fault...
- No, it's not your fault.

1455
01:08:34,231 --> 01:08:35,866
I was supposed to buy
the wristbands last night...

1456
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,701
Yeah, no, of course
it's not her fault.

1457
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,669
It's yours.
Why would you lie?

1458
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:41,939
Because, darling, this was all
a plan to hook up with you.

1459
01:08:41,973 --> 01:08:43,207
- What?
- Which seems like

1460
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,042
- it almost worked.
- What? No.

1461
01:08:45,076 --> 01:08:46,776
No,
nothing happened between us.

1462
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:48,145
Then why did I hear Josh
bragging this morning

1463
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:49,947
about your special night?

1464
01:08:50,414 --> 01:08:52,682
Look, Zoey,
I can explain...

1465
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:54,251
Look, baby, baby, baby.
Whatever happened, happened,

1466
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:56,187
all right?
I don't own you.

1467
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,888
You're free to hook
up with whoever you want.

1468
01:08:57,922 --> 01:08:59,589
It's just a little bit
of a blow to the ego

1469
01:08:59,622 --> 01:09:01,192
that it was with
that pillock over there.

1470
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,060
Okay, okay, nobody
hooked up with anybody.

1471
01:09:03,094 --> 01:09:03,894
(horn honking)

1472
01:09:05,595 --> 01:09:07,298
Look, let's just finish
this later, all right?

1473
01:09:07,331 --> 01:09:08,933
We don't even
need the wristbands,

1474
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:11,068
we've got an in with the VIPs,
so let's just go.

1475
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:16,639
(♪♪♪)

1476
01:09:16,673 --> 01:09:18,608
Zoey...

1477
01:09:18,641 --> 01:09:21,578
Zoey! Zoey,
wait. Zoey, wait...

1478
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:23,813
So this was all just
like a big plan to get me

1479
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:25,916
on your diving board
and to play your stupid mix?

1480
01:09:26,549 --> 01:09:28,319
- I thought we were connecting.
- I thought I was speaking

1481
01:09:28,352 --> 01:09:30,221
to somebody
who was being sincere.

1482
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:31,554
Even if we
had hooked up, like,

1483
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:33,224
what did you think
was gonna happen?

1484
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:35,759
'Cause I know. Nothing.

1485
01:09:36,193 --> 01:09:37,627
I would have
woken up the next day

1486
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,662
and I would
have still gone to L.A.

1487
01:09:40,464 --> 01:09:43,968
Grow up, dude.
You don't know me.

1488
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:45,535
You don't
even know yourself.

1489
01:09:47,637 --> 01:09:49,639
I think maybe we should
just get in the Lyft and go.

1490
01:09:49,672 --> 01:09:51,574
I mean,
we're here.

1491
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:53,944
You're going too?

1492
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:58,249
You know what? Fine, go.
Go have fun at the festival.

1493
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:00,084
Can you just hold on a second?
Josh!

1494
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:02,953
Go have fun with
your new friend.

1495
01:10:02,987 --> 01:10:04,654
(scoffs)

1496
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:07,024
Are you serious
right now? Fun?

1497
01:10:07,525 --> 01:10:09,360
Dude,
I came here to help you.

1498
01:10:09,393 --> 01:10:11,694
I was just
released from jail.

1499
01:10:11,728 --> 01:10:12,595
Your cellmate,
he's waiting.

1500
01:10:21,738 --> 01:10:22,940
No.

1501
01:10:23,207 --> 01:10:24,841
No,
you don't get to do this, Josh.

1502
01:10:26,277 --> 01:10:28,079
You don't get to dump
your emotions out on me

1503
01:10:28,112 --> 01:10:30,981
and then act
like it's my fault.

1504
01:10:31,549 --> 01:10:34,717
I am your wingwoman.
I am your best friend.

1505
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,718
I...

1506
01:10:37,754 --> 01:10:39,323
I've been here.

1507
01:10:39,924 --> 01:10:42,860
(♪♪♪)

1508
01:10:55,406 --> 01:10:56,373
(car engine starting)

1509
01:10:57,942 --> 01:10:58,741
Let's go.

1510
01:11:07,218 --> 01:11:08,352
(loud grunt)

1511
01:11:21,764 --> 01:11:23,800
(cell phone ringing)

1512
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:26,403
Where's my essay?

1513
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:28,638
I was,
uh...

1514
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:31,841
I don't have it.

1515
01:11:31,876 --> 01:11:33,210
I didn't do it. So,
you know what, just fail me

1516
01:11:33,244 --> 01:11:34,445
'cause I don't care
about the essay anymore.

1517
01:11:34,478 --> 01:11:35,980
<i>That's not what
I was expecting</i>

1518
01:11:36,013 --> 01:11:38,149
to hear you say,
Mr. Torres.

1519
01:11:38,182 --> 01:11:40,918
You told me you'd
get me the essay today.

1520
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:43,154
I don't care about
the essay, Mr. Elmer.

1521
01:11:43,187 --> 01:11:45,356
I'm stranded in middle of
nowhere and my life is a mess.

1522
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:48,392
Of course your life's a mess,
you're a teenager.

1523
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:50,161
Yeah, but everything was
finally going the way I wanted.

1524
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:51,794
You know, like in the movies.

1525
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:54,231
The movies?
Hey, do me a favor.

1526
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:56,333
Just calm down,
okay?

1527
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,801
- <i>Are you calm?</i>
- Yeah.

1528
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:01,704
Hey, I'm not your
therapist, okay? But...

1529
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,374
<i>you're a
nice kid. I actually</i>

1530
01:12:03,407 --> 01:12:05,442
dislike you
less than the others.

1531
01:12:05,476 --> 01:12:07,211
They annoy me like crazy.

1532
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:10,214
<i>So let me give
you a piece of advice.</i>

1533
01:12:10,481 --> 01:12:14,817
Don't place your happiness
into something that's not real,

1534
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:16,786

1536
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,294
Tsui Hangs,
best Chinese in town.

1537
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,397
It's too late, Mr. Elmer.
It's over.

1538
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,932
High school's over,
you were right.

1539
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:30,733
The weekend isn't over.
Get that essay to me.

1540
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,885
I'm gonna fix it,
I promise.

1541
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:49,420
Uh-huh.

1542
01:12:58,362 --> 01:12:59,964
I didn't... I didn't handle
the situation ideally.

1543
01:13:00,331 --> 01:13:01,365
You lied to me.

1544
01:13:02,499 --> 01:13:04,068
I'm sorry.

1545
01:13:05,035 --> 01:13:07,271
I'm not gonna go, Donnie.
I made a commitment to you...

1546
01:13:07,304 --> 01:13:09,173
Stop!
Would you just stop?

1547
01:13:09,506 --> 01:13:12,142
Stop? Stop being honest
with you? Stop telling...

1548
01:13:12,176 --> 01:13:13,978
Are you
trying to piss me off?

1549
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:16,547
I can't win with you.
Everything I say pisses you off.

1550
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,183
I'm not upset that you
applied to college, Mikey.

1551
01:13:19,216 --> 01:13:21,118
I'm upset that
you kept it from me.

1552
01:13:21,885 --> 01:13:23,287
How...

1553
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:26,090
How could you think
that I wouldn't support you?

1554
01:13:31,462 --> 01:13:33,197
This is your dream,
this, this...

1555
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:34,932
This is everything to you.

1556
01:13:35,266 --> 01:13:37,468
No, man,
you are.

1557
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:44,975
I'm not...

1558
01:13:47,478 --> 01:13:49,079
I'm not perfect,
you know?

1559
01:13:49,113 --> 01:13:50,381
But I'm gonna keep
doing what's best for you.

1560
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,850
You want to go to school,

1561
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:56,220
so we'll use my
savings and we get you there.

1562
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:58,322
You're going.

1563
01:14:04,428 --> 01:14:05,896

Yes!

1571
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,556
All right, so I was thinking
we go to the Motel Mermaid,

1572
01:14:32,589 --> 01:14:34,091

wrap up at the festival,

1573

He says,
"You feel it."

Maybe it's because

I thought that you
came here to be with me,

1705
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:49,292
and lying to you,
that was...

1706
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:51,028
No,
don't... don't worry about it.

1707
01:21:51,062 --> 01:21:52,763
I mean, like,
not calculating the risk

1708
01:21:52,796 --> 01:21:55,832
is actually on brand for me,
right?

1709
01:21:55,867 --> 01:21:59,070
Look, psychology is
not an exact science.

1710
01:21:59,103 --> 01:22:00,737
Some would say
there's a lot of guesswork.

1711
01:22:00,771 --> 01:22:02,305
No, no,
I think it was like,

1712
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:05,877
exactly what I needed to hear,
actually.

1713
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:07,611
Um,
how did it go

1714
01:22:07,644 --> 01:22:09,713
with the Mr.
Bowling Shirt?

1715
01:22:13,683 --> 01:22:15,887
I... nothing happened.

1716
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,556
Like,
we talked. He's nice.

1717
01:22:19,589 --> 01:22:22,793
We were in jail,
that kind of complicated things.

1718
01:22:22,826 --> 01:22:24,361
He's definitely very cute.

1719
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:34,805
(♪♪♪)

1720
01:22:41,545 --> 01:22:43,080
To Front and Center.

1721
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:47,919
Cheers.

1722
01:22:47,952 --> 01:22:51,088
Well, this tent's
nice and all, but, um...

1723
01:22:51,122 --> 01:22:52,556
How 'bout we
get outta here?

1724
01:22:52,589 --> 01:22:55,026
Lovelytheband's
taking the stage soon.

1725
01:22:55,059 --> 01:22:56,093
Okay.

1726
01:22:56,127 --> 01:22:57,661
Hey, Zoey,
you wanna come?

1727
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:02,699
Um, you know, I'm going
to catch you later I think.

1728
01:23:02,732 --> 01:23:05,468
- Are you good?
- Yes.

1729
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:06,938
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1730
01:23:11,842 --> 01:23:13,144
(exhales)

1731
01:23:13,177 --> 01:23:14,744
(laughing)

1732
01:23:14,778 --> 01:23:16,713
Love it!
Absolutely love it.

1733
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:18,481
They're going
mental out there.

1734
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:21,118
- Hey, Kale.
- One sec.

1735
01:23:21,152 --> 01:23:23,386
Kale.

1736
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,689
Just give me a second.

1737
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:27,859
Babe! My Birkenstocks!

1738
01:23:27,892 --> 01:23:29,693
Babe! Babe, babe,
babe. What's going on?

1739
01:23:29,726 --> 01:23:31,528
I'm in the middle of
connecting with Sophia.

1740
01:23:31,561 --> 01:23:34,564
All right? Just hang out here,
soak in the vibes.

1741
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:36,167
This is what our
life's gonna be like in L.A.

1742
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,169
I know,
so I'm leaving.

1743
01:23:38,202 --> 01:23:39,836
All right,
I will catch you later.

1744
01:23:39,871 --> 01:23:42,372
No, Kale. I'm leaving.

1745
01:23:47,011 --> 01:23:48,980
Wait, you're not
coming to L.A.?

1746
01:23:49,013 --> 01:23:51,448
- No.
- Well, why? Why not?

1747
01:23:51,481 --> 01:23:53,084
Why the... why the change?

1748
01:23:53,117 --> 01:23:54,618
(Zoey sighs)

1749
01:23:54,651 --> 01:23:56,954
L.A. is your dream, Kale,
it's...

1750
01:23:56,988 --> 01:23:58,521
It's not mine.

1751
01:23:58,555 --> 01:24:00,824
This is what's
best for both of us.

Hey.

1758
01:24:30,154 --> 01:24:32,822
How... what...
what're you doing here?

1759
01:24:32,857 --> 01:24:35,059
I had some unfinished
business...

1760
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:38,162
What're you... wait,
where's...

1761

I, uh...

1763
01:24:44,068 --> 01:24:46,770
broke up with him.

1764
01:24:46,803 --> 01:24:48,772
You did?

1765
01:24:48,805 --> 01:24:50,640
Yep, I did.

1766
01:24:53,576 --> 01:24:55,779
I'm so sorry
if I did anything...

1767
01:24:55,812 --> 01:24:57,614
No, no. Although
you did, you know,

1768
01:24:57,647 --> 01:24:59,984
drag us out here
and lie about it, but...

1769
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:01,618
if it weren't for you,
I'd probably be

1770
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:04,188
in L.A. right
now hating life, so...

1771
01:25:04,221 --> 01:25:06,958
I actually feel kind of
liberated or something.

1772
01:25:09,559 --> 01:25:11,896
And I just want to
make something clear

1773
01:25:11,929 --> 01:25:14,531
between the two of us.

1774
01:25:14,564 --> 01:25:17,667
I like you,

1775
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,703
but just as a friend.

1776
01:25:19,736 --> 01:25:22,539
And that's
all it's gonna be.

1777
01:25:22,572 --> 01:25:24,808
That's fine, because I only
want to be friends, too.

1778
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:26,609
I mean,
for the longest time

1779
01:25:26,643 --> 01:25:27,979
I actually
thought I loved you.

1780
01:25:28,012 --> 01:25:29,280
- Yeah, no, I know.
- No, like full-on,

1781
01:25:29,313 --> 01:25:30,647
thought of you
all night love you.

1782
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,117
Oh, wow, okay,
got it.

1783
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:37,154
But here's the thing.
Over this past weekend, I...

1784
01:25:37,188 --> 01:25:41,691
Yeah, Josh, every girl knows
when a guy is into them,

1785
01:25:41,725 --> 01:25:44,728
and every girl knows when
a guy is into somebody else.

1786
01:25:44,761 --> 01:25:47,697
- So what are you doing here?
- Where is she?

1787
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:49,033
She went with Sebastian
to go see Lovelytheband

1788
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:51,268
and I think that you
should move quick, fast.

1789
01:25:51,302 --> 01:25:52,635
Go, go, go,
go.

1790
01:25:52,669 --> 01:25:57,574
(♪♪♪)

1791
01:25:57,607 --> 01:26:00,077
Wait, I thought that we
were gonna see Lovelytheband.

1792
01:26:00,111 --> 01:26:02,612
There's like,
a great spot like, right there.

1793
01:26:02,645 --> 01:26:05,815
Oh, yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, I know, but, um...

1794
01:26:05,849 --> 01:26:08,919
I know a better one.

1795
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:11,654
(♪♪♪)

1796
01:26:17,361 --> 01:26:18,795
Shall we?

1797
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:24,035
Oh, man, these
are really good.

1798
01:26:24,068 --> 01:26:26,070
- Yes!
- Oh yeah.

1799
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:27,972
- Here, get in on this.
- Oh yeah!

1800
01:26:28,005 --> 01:26:30,774
(girl) I heard these are
the best grilled cheeses.

1801
01:26:30,807 --> 01:26:31,909
(man) Everyone
is talking about them.

1802
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:36,746
(indistinct chatter)

1803
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:39,984
We've officially sold out!
Thank you, Front and Center!

1804
01:26:40,017 --> 01:26:43,220
But the Milleni-Yum Falcon
is jumping to light speed.

1805
01:26:43,254 --> 01:26:45,856
And may the fromage
be with you.

1806
01:26:47,191 --> 01:26:48,292
(all groaning)

1807
01:26:55,665 --> 01:26:56,901
- Hey!
- Looks like you guys

1808
01:26:56,934 --> 01:26:58,335
are already in business.

1809
01:26:58,369 --> 01:27:00,905
Oh, you know, just
for one night, cuz.

1810
01:27:00,938 --> 01:27:02,672
Oh, and we officially
have enough money

1811
01:27:02,705 --> 01:27:05,109
- to make it home.
- Oh, great.

1812
01:27:05,142 --> 01:27:07,211
Just in time too,
Lovelytheband's about to take the stage.

1813
01:27:07,244 --> 01:27:10,713
Oh,
are you alone right now?

1814
01:27:10,747 --> 01:27:13,616
Yeah, yeah, I am, it's, uh,
it's a new thing I'm trying.

1815
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,019
Get used to it.

1816
01:27:15,052 --> 01:27:16,753
Wait,
where's our boy?

1817
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:19,323
(man) Have they
started singing yet?

1818
01:27:23,793 --> 01:27:25,662
(announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen.

1819
01:27:25,695 --> 01:27:28,399
And now, the moment
you've been waiting for.

just met, right?

And... and you have technically

01:29:58,282 --> 01:30:00,184
not asked me on,
like, a formal date,

1856
01:30:00,217 --> 01:30:04,989
and, uh, we don't
know each other, like, at all.

1857

maybe relax for a second, okay?

1858
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:10,561
And just
chill. Let's just...

1859

I'm sorry I missed
the fireworks.

1883
01:31:40,117 --> 01:31:41,352
I was running
through the field

1884
01:31:41,385 --> 01:31:42,920

If you would
have told me yesterday

1908
01:32:58,262 --> 01:33:01,398
I was chasing
after a false dream,

1909
01:33:01,432 --> 01:33:05,335
that I was trying to live
a movie version of myself,

1910
01:33:05,369 --> 01:33:07,271
I would have
said you're crazy.

gotta fall before you realize

How was my high
school experience?

1914
01:33:17,147 --> 01:33:20,050
One of waking up.

1915
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:23,387
And you know
what I realized?

1916
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:26,557
Life isn't a movie.
