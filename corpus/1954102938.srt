00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,911
First floor there's
a bed where we--

366
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,147
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Used to be
the maid's room, but we don't

367
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:09,981
have--

368
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,550
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
welcome, welcome.

369
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:16,420
Make yourself at home.

370
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,356
-Oh, wow.

371
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,124
Hey.

372
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,027
Who is this guy?

373
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,928
Hey, buddy.

374
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,129
-That's Bonnet.

375
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,964
-Hi cutie fruity patootie.

376
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,701
That is the best name
ever for a pup.

377
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:31,669
-Let me show you--

378
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,904
Let me show you your digs.

379
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,005
Oh man.

380
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,976
Let's get some fresh
air in this room!

381
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,546
Oh.

382
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,115
Sorry.

383
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:48,119
Yeah, this used to be
our live in's room.

384
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:52,623
I know it's stupid to think that
we'd need a housekeeper.

385
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,758
I don't even have a job.

386
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,727
But, you know, she
was a godsend.

387
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,864
Because when I got pregnant
with Logan, you know, I

388
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,332
thought, I'm not gonna
have a baby nurse.

389
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm not gonna need
any of that.

390
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,868
You know, I'm gonna-
I'm a mother.

391
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,836
My body is built for this.

392
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,505
And then came home, milk
didn't come in.

393
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:11,442
Tried and tried to nurse,
couldn't latch on.

394
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,245
Apparently my nipples
are too small.

395
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:17,615
So, he wouldn't stop crying for
anybody except for Luce.

396
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:22,153
And she's just so calm
that she just--

397
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,854
Ugh.

398
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,791
When Logan got into school, we
had to let her go, you know?

399
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,327
And then we maybe thought for
a minute we were gonna have

400
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,463
another kid, and then we-- or it
was gonna be an office for

401
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,331
me, or--

402
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,732
-I like this color.

403
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,202
This room would look really
good in this color.

404
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:41,105
Do you ice skate?

405
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:41,839
-Oh, these?

406
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,541
Well, you know.

407
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,876
For a hot New York minute.

408
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:46,510
Got my--

409
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,046
My skate on.

410
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,282
-My mom always told me that I
should surround myself with

411
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,083
good people if I want good
things to happen.

412
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,190
I'm 55 days sober, so good
people are really important.

413
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,424
-Oh my god.

414
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,260
McKenna, that's amazing.

415
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,527
Congratulations.

416
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,729
Wow.

417
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,498
-My mom's a witch.

418
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,166
The Wiccan kind of
witch, you know?

419
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,904
Sometimes I think I
might be one too.

420
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,876
Is that my bathroom?

421
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,278
D-d--

422
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,947
Do you need clean towels?

423
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,282
We have company.

424
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,153
-Go, go, go, go, go.

425
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,254
I'm listening.

426
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,023
-We have company.

427
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,391
-Who's here?

428
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:36,861
-Have you ever heard of the
Espresso Yourself truck?

429
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:41,732
-The coffee they make, Jeff,
is like you cannot believe.

430
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,035
You know when people just
make one thing right?

431
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,469
It's great.

432
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,837
-It's obsession worthy.

433
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,638
-OK.

434
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,906
-So, I started--

435
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:49,940
I started to follow the
truck on Twitter.

436
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,542
-I thought you hated Twitter.

437
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,210
-I don't hate Twitter, Jeff.

438
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,545
I'm not--

439
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,215
I lurk on Twitter.

440
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,083
-You're a lurker.

441
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,718
-Just not a Tweeter.

442
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,554
So, a few weeks ago, the truck
was parked right across the

443
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,822
street from Sam's.

444
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,357
Wait, let me get you--

445
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,024
Let me get you some--

446
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,959
-Sam who?

447
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,194
-Uh, Hofbrau.

448
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,662
Sam's Hofbrau.

449
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,664
That was the strip bar, or like,
you know, topless place

450
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,800
or whatever that we went to.

451
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,435
Oh, you need cutlery.

452
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,437
Anyway--

453
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:22,373
who would've thunk it--
ran into McKenna.

454
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,275
-I don't know who McKenna is.

455
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,610
-Oh, she, um--

456
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,179
She's the dancer that--

457
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:32,283
She's the dancer that gave me
that private thingy when we

458
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,184
were there.

459
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,618
-You mean the stripper?

460
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,721
-OK, sure.

461
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,557
The stripper, is in
the maid's room.

462
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,026
-The stripper's in
the maid's room.

463
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,794
-Yeah.

464
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,564
-How did the stripper get
in the maid's room?

465
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:49,233
-I put her there.

466
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,069
So, I kept going back to the
Espresso Yourself truck, and

467
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:55,439
every time I would go there, I
kept running into McKenna.

468
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,775
So we just started talking.

469
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,511
Anyway, she was, like, between
apartments, her car was

470
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:01,946
getting towed.

471
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,148
She had nowhere to stay tonight,
and you know all the

472
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,318
work that I do for the homeless
at the J, and, you

473
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,953
know, I thought, here's--

474
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,956
OK, Here's actual homelessness
right in front of me.

475
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:16,193
-So you invited her to
stay here in our

476
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,562
house with our child?

477
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,498
-Just for like a-- two nights.

478
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,466
Like, one night maybe.

479
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,869
You won't even notice
she's here, Jeff.

480
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,070
JEFF (OFFSCREEN): (WHISPERING)
I don't wanna

481
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:26,837
meet her right now.

482
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,038
I think we should just--

483
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,373
-Shut up.

484
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,381
Just a few days.

485
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,483
OK, we gotta keep quiet.

486
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,056
I love you.

487
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,364
-Morning.

488
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:54,832
-Uh, hey.

489
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,635
Hey.

490
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,936
-I remember you.

491
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,138
You guys were, like, the
cutest couple ever.

492
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,540
-Oh, thank you.

493
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,641
We work at it.

494
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,109
Actually, we don't.

495
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,244
Do you want some coffee?

496
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,246
-Um, do you have tea?

497
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,781
-Yeah.

498
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,821
-Oh, wow, look at
this, a tea box.

499
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:20,958
-We're sort of-- sort of
hooked up that way.

500
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,227
-Yeah.

501
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:26,063
I'll take a chai spice.

502
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,165
-Yeah, why not?

503
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,167
I have to say, that was, like,
the best sleep I've had in

504
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,335
five years.

505
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,236
Not joking.

506
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,804
Hollywood is so noisy.

507
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,640
-Yeah, sometimes I find the
birds in this neighborhood can

508
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,609
be rather cacophonous.

509
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:42,046
You know, loud and chirpy.

510
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,320
-Rachel told me that
you invent apps.

511
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,154
-She wasn't lying.

512
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,156
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN):
I love apps.

513
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,557
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

514
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,425
-Yeah?

515
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:55,459
-You like your job?

516
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,963
-Um, I used to.

517
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:04,201
I recently sold the, or
got bought, merged.

518
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:09,139
There are any number of ways to
describe what actually went

519
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,941
down with Happy Farm.

520
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:11,909
Logan, hey.

521
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,044
-Buddy, this is McKenna.

522
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:17,815
She's, um, uh, a friend
of your mom's.

523
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,050
I've heard a lot about you.

524
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,018
-Yeah?

525
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,987
I love your monkey backpack.

526
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,589
-I asked for an elephant.

527
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,291
-Well, talk to your mom.

528
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,893
-I did.

529
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,895
-We're gonna get you hooked up
with breakfast real quick, Mr.

530
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,264
Man, because we are running
a little late.

531
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,266
-OK.

532
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:36,267
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

533
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,501
-Hi.

534
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,636
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN):
Uh, good morning.

535
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:39,336
Logan, you met my
friend McKenna?

536
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,104
-Yeah.

537
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,438
McKenna, Jeff.

538
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,072
You got it.

539
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,875
-Great.

540
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,277
How did you--

541
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,278
How did you sleep?

542
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,646
-Really, really good.

543
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,580
-Oh good.

544
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,048
Oh good, you--

545
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,982
Good.

546
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,183
-Quiet in here.

547
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,618
-Yeah.

548
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,822
So, um, uh, you can take
Logan to school today?

549
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,559
Jeff, I just want to make
sure that McKenna is--

550
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,127
-Got it, I am on it.

551
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,194
--taken care of.

552
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,195
-Thank you.

553
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,564
-OK, great.

554
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,265
You need milk.

555
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,667
-OK.

556
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,101
OK, she looks like a completely
different person,

557
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,870
-I know.

558
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:13,504
-She looks like a college
kid or something.

559
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:14,405
-Right?

560
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,573
Dancing is just her job.

561
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:16,473
A job does not define
who you are.

562
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,608
-Right.

563
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,676
-I really think I
can help her.

564
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:19,710
She had a really
difficult life.

565
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:20,678
-Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

566
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,146
OK, all right.

567
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,180
I'm shaking it out.

568
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:23,914
There's a stripper in my pool.

569
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,082
No big.

570
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,517
-OK.

571
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,351
Oh, that's a nice looking one.

572
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,252
-Yeah, is that OK?

573
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,019
What do strippers like?

574
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,454
-Not that, because she's sober.

575
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,221
-Oh.

576
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:31,989
Good for her.

577
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:35,092
-Imagine that you're
cleaning out a rim.

578
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,093
-OK?

579
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,528
-Cleaning out a rim.

580
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,596
It's a big rim.

581
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:39,463
It's more like a
trash can size.

582
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,464
-OK.

583
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,465
-Oh, like a garbage can rim.

584
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,700
-Her shame is trapped there.

585
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,802
We gotta get that exercised.

586
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,904
Be gentle with it.

587
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:47,538
-Shame.

588
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,405
-Stephanie!

589
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,139
-I really got this.

590
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,541
-Stephanie!

591
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,543
-You're waking up
in the morning.

592
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:54,545
-Should we give her a pole?

593
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,546
-You want--

594
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:56,547
-Oh shit.

595
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:57,181
-Yeah.

596
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,148
-Body.

597
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,883
-No, you guys.

598
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,753
-Those are the guys that come
in and they're like, lap

599
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:06,423
dance, lap dance, lap
dance, every night.

600
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,326
And they always have their
favorite girls.

601
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:13,931
And they're the ones that tell
you things like, oh baby, I'm

602
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,533
gonna be the one that gets
to see you for real.

603
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:17,801
I'm gonna help get you
down off of this

604
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,638
pole, blah, blah, blah.

605
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,506
We call them Captain
Save-a-Ho.

606
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,475
-Captain Save-a-Ho,
that's hilarious.

607
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,014
-Yeah, I made $6,000
of one once.

608
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,686
-Wait, 6,000 just for dancing?

609
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,255
-Well, some girls dance
just to dance, right?

610
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:42,426
But I like to use the club for
networking, meeting people,

611
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,194
building relationships.

612
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,830
I'm not the kind of girl who's
gonna tell you that she'll

613
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,166
strip but she won't get naked,
or she'll give you a lap dance

614
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,569
but she won't touch you, or
she'll touch you, but she

615
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,737
won't give you oral.

616
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,273
I'm pretty much down
for anything.

617
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,808
Full service sex worker.

618
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,718
-Um, what--

619
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,987
What is a sex worker?

620
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:16,260
This one guy Warren, I mean,
he pays via Paypal.

621
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,227
It's awesome.

622
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,028
There's no cash exchange.

623
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,064
It's very clean.

624
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,434
And then there's this Jack, and
he's been my regular on

625
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,469
Tuesdays for like
a million years.

626
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,104
I love him like a brother.

627
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,242
He's your kind of run
of the mill, typical

628
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,745
vanilla kinky guy.

629
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,014
He's into some weird shit.

630
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,817
He sometimes likes
a girl to watch.

631
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,225
You should come, Rachel.

632
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,593
-Yes, you should.

633
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,061
You really should.

634
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:55,566
I'll take Logan to soccer
so you can go.

635
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,502
-Thank you, that would
be a huge help.

636
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,570
Sorry.

637
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,872
I'm gonna ruing a perfectly
good blow out.

638
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,409
Hey Captain Save-a-Ho.

639
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,011
She's a hooker.

640
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:41,979
-Sh, it's OK.

641
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:42,880
-No, it's not OK.

642
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:43,647
-Yeah it is.

643
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,182
-Is that a nursing bra?

644
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,150
-Oh, yeah.

645
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,117
-Logan's five.

646
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,120
Throw it the fuck out.

647
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,157
-You didn't know about
that part, right?

648
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,359
The friends I see sometimes?

649
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,628
-You were right about that.

650
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,963
-You still want me to
stay at the house?

651
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,969
-If you want out of that
life, I can help you.

652
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,172
-I mean, I've saved first
and last month's rent.

653
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,440
I could give that to you.

654
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,075
And I could help take
care of Logan.

655
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,511
-Exactly, but no money.

656
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:18,549
-I'd feel weird taking
something from you.

657
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:21,218
If you think that I
can help you, I

658
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,954
promise, you're not taking.

659
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,991
-It's inappropriate.

660
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,693
-Aren't you supposed to
be non-judgmental?

661
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,830
I'm supposed to be clear mirror,
baccarat crystal.

662
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,265
Excuse me, I have to
eat something.

663
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,834
I was recently diagnosed with

664
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,269
perimenopausal low blood sugar.

665
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,309
I brought quinoa from home.

666
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:59,022
-She just seems way too young
and, I don't know, healthy to

667
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,158
be spending her time having
sex for money.

668
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,060
-Isn't that her choice?

669
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,962
May I share something?

670
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,730
When Portia was in
graduate school--

671
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,565
-No, Lenore, I don't wanna
hear about Portia.

672
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,034
I think that's inappropriate.

673
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,904
-I don't know why I wanna
take care of McKenna.

674
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:17,040
I mean, what if I listen to you
and I'm like, oh, Lenore

675
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,710
says it's inappropriate, so I
guess it's inappropriate.

676
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:20,944
So I go home and I'm like,
sorry, McKenna.

677
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,013
Turns out, this is
inappropriate.

678
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:28,151
So, out she goes, back on the
street, robbed of her one

679
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,120
opportunity she had
to finally escape

680
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,421
from being a sex worker.

681
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,723
-What's a sex worker?

682
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:33,590
-That's what she calls it.

683
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,591
-She's a prostitute.

684
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,393
-That is such an awful word.

685
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:40,030
-It's a highly accurate
word, Rachel.

686
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,632
-I think I need a break
from therapy.

687
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,200
-Well, I think that's
ill advised.

688
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:45,335
Just last week, you were
complaining about how you and

689
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,004
Jeff are no longer
making love.

690
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,439
I mean, if you wanna
choose words, let's

691
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,241
just call it not fucking.

692
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,544
-I think you should start
coming in twice a week.

693
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,117
-Mwah.

694
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,485
-Bye.

695
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:03,086
Oh, hey.

696
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,055
Uh, this is, uh--

697
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,124
This is, um, Amanda
and Meredith.

698
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:11,128
-Nice to meet you.

699
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,463
-Bye.

700
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,431
-Stephanie.

701
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,399
-Oh, McKenna.

702
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,233
Oh my gosh.

703
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:16,867
You're still here.

704
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,637
-Yeah, uh, um, I'm teaching her
about drop offs in case

705
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,072
she has to do a drop off.

706
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:24,107
Well, I'll see you guys soon.

707
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,108
-OK, bye.

708
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,445
-If it's a Monday, you wanna
bring his math stuff with

709
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,079
you--

710
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,847
-And if it's a Friday,
you wanna--

711
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:34,518
Did you ever get my sign up
paper for Craftacular?

712
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,652
-Oh.

713
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:36,420
-Because I didn't
see your name.

714
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,788
-I'm so sorry.

715
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,456
I'm sorry, I forgot.

716
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,190
-Hi.

717
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,358
Who's this?

718
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,994
-Oh, uh, this is Logan's
new nanny.

719
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,062
This is McKenna.

720
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,597
-McKenna, this is Jennie.

721
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,066
-Oh, nice to meet you.

722
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,934
-Wow, you been thinking about
going back to work Rach?

723
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:51,868
-Yeah, thinking about
thinking about it.

724
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,636
JENNIE (OFFSCREEN): Great.

725
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,904
Where you from?

726
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:55,105
-I'm from Chico in Northern
California.

727
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:56,807
-Yeah, I found her through
an agency.

728
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:00,110
-Well, careful, because I am
known to steal nannies.

729
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,878
I am a nanny stealer.

730
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,146
Hey.

731
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,581
Do you wanna--

732
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,984
Do you wanna captain a table
at Craftacular, McKenna?

733
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,853
It's, like, a lot of kids doing
crafts, raising money

734
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,421
for Jewish women with cancer.

735
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:15,192
-Jennie, I am so sorry, but I
gotta show McKenna where the

736
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:15,826
dry cleaners is.

737
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,694
It was nice to meet you.

738
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:18,862
-I'll register.

739
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,197
I promise.

740
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,936
Just like another week, until
she gets on her feet.

741
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:31,274
What exactly do you intend
to do for her?

742
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,043
-Help her tell her story.

743
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:37,080
Maybe I can help her
set up a blog.

744
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:38,949
She and I could co-blog.

745
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:40,150
-You wanna--

746
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:41,952
You wanna blog with her?

747
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:44,721
A lot of good things have
come from blogging.

748
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,824
-Name one good thing that's
come from blogging.

749
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,494
-OK, that crunchy kale
salad that I made.

750
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:53,063
That was from someone's blog.

751
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,565
Blogging's amazing.

752
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:59,202
-So, and we are recording.

753
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,704
OK.

754
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,539
So, we are not sure what this is
going to be yet, if this is

755
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:08,378
gonna be a blog, a co-blog,
article, podcast.

756
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,079
We're going to just--

757
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:10,347
Who knows?

758
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,515
Keep it loose.

759
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,949
Right now we're just
gonna have a--

760
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,152
just a-- just going to call--
call it a conversation.

761
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:15,752
-Yeah.

762
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,320
-OK.

763
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:21,358
You are a sex worker.

764
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,192
-Yes.

765
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:23,627
I'm a sex worker.

766
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:28,165
-And you have been, uh, working
in sex for how long?

767
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,232
-Two years.

768
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,834
I started when I was 20.

769
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,039
-You told me you were 19.

770
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,475
I tell all my customers that.

771
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,577
It's like, a barely
legal thing.

772
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,046
It turns them on.

773
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:48,318
-What does it mean to see other
people as customers?

774
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,088
-Doctors have customers,
psychiatrists have customers,

775
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,123
people that work in stores
have customers.

776
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,858
A lot of people in this
world have customers.

777
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,426
-What if those customers
had wives?

778
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,662
-So?

779
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,864
-You didn't feel a sense
of responsibility or--

780
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,099
-No.

781
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:02,966
-Sisterliness?

782
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,401
-No.

783
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,936
-Compassion?

784
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:09,139
-Yeah, I feel compassion for a
world where men have a way

785
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:14,611
higher sex drive, and it's a
proven fact, and their wives

786
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,847
lose interest in having
sex with term.

787
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,982
Yeah, I feel compassion
for that.

788
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,454
-Oh my god.

789
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,957
-Thank you for coming home.

790
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,525
-Thank you for calling
me home.

791
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,798
This is not at all what I had
scheduled for my afternoon.

792
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,447
-Hey.

793
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,214
-What?

794
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,449
-Open your eyes.

795
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:53,216
-What?

796
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,050
-Do me a favor.

797
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,051
Open your eyes.

798
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,052
Hey.

799
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,053
Hi.

800
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:59,856
-You wanna try having
an eyes open orgasm?

801
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,525
Yeah?

802
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:02,492
Like this?

803
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,460
-There you are.

804
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:04,227
-Hey, hello, how are you?

805
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,997
-Hey, long time.

806
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,298
You know what?

807
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,932
Close them.

808
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,367
-I'm sorry.

809
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,067
Just keep them closed.

810
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:15,906
-Do what you gotta do.

811
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,440
-Sorry.

812
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,909
-Oh, I'm good.

813
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:22,112
-Yeah.

814
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,446
-I can get back in there.

815
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,182
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

816
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:25,882
-No?

817
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:29,853
-Takes a second to get
back on the bus.

818
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,554
-Yep.

819
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,489
-Been a while.

820
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,024
Glad we did it though, so.

821
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:34,991
-Yeah, yeah.

822
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,159
-Nice work.

823
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,627
-Right.

824
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:43,200
-Um, so, I can when I get back
later tonight from work.

825
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,134
Yeah?

826
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:48,371
-Um, actually, I'm gonna be
much later than I thought.

827
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,673
-No worries.

828
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,540
-Because I had to reschedule
this conference

829
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,576
call and I have to--

830
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:53,577
[phone vibrating]

831
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:54,611
-Hold on.

832
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:55,545
Someone's calling me right now.

833
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,246
Hello?

834
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:57,147
Yeah, hey.

835
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,148
This is Jeff.

836
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,051
If they're still on the call, I
need you to patch me through

837
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,385
right away.

838
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,340
--We're running late, honey.

839
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,308
-My legs are stuck.

840
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,310
-Logan.

841
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,979
Logan, you have to help me.

842
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,014
-Flex your legs.

843
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,349
Let go.

844
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,089
[knocking]

845
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,423
-Mhmm.

846
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,960
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Hi.

847
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:46,763
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Jeff
said that you were sick.

848
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,199
-Oh, I feel Shit City.

849
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,834
I'm all right, I think.

850
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,636
-You know your body's
not gonna heal

851
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,304
if you mind's tweaking.

852
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,071
-I'm not--

853
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,473
No, wait, I--

854
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,041
McKenna, I have to reach out.

855
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,743
I have to reach out to hot dog
vendors for this Craftacular

856
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,012
or Jennie is going to kill me.

857
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,113
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN):
Do you have any of

858
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,281
that menthol rub stuff?

859
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,315
Do you know what I'm
talking about?

860
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,452
-McKenna, I'm fine.

861
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,420
-Ah, ah, ah.

862
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,688
You do have it.

863
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,323
-McKenna, I don't
need anything.

864
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,858
-Do you have a sock?

865
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,459
-Can I use these?

866
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,494
-I mean, those are gross.

867
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,261
I don't know what you're even.

868
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,296
-Smells fine.

869
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:19,929
-You don't have to do anything.

870
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,097
-OK.

871
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,699
-I don't even--

872
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:25,068
-Give me your foot.

873
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,336
-Again, honey.

874
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:29,072
Please, I am total--

875
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,407
-Put it down.

876
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,275
-I am fine.

877
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,043
Lay down.

878
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,477
-Lady.

879
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,446
I am fine.

880
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,580
-OK?

881
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,082
Just pause.

882
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,887
OK.

883
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,439
My grandma used to do this
to me and my cousins

884
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,107
when we were sick.

885
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,241
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Grandma.

886
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:06,509
-Yeah.

887
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,044
Grandma Ninny.

888
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,088
-Did you say Ninny?

889
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,089
-Mhmm.

890
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,457
My mom's mom.

891
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,859
I lived with her a lot.

892
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,762
You have to keep
your feet warm.

893
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,101
-You do not have to do this.

894
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,271
-Makes me happy.

895
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,165
I can feel in your feet
where you're blocked.

896
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,236
In your right hip.

897
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,041
We'll just shake it out.

898
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,376
OK.

899
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,481
Just shake it out a little.

900
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:33,329
Oh yeah, it's really
right in here.

901
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,536
[whispers]

902
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,070
OK.

903
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,375
Can I open this?

904
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:49,612
-Um.

905
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,347
I'm not wearing a bra.

906
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,849
-Just breathe.

00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:44,467
[heavy breathing]

908
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:53,943

909
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,316
-Hey, cute dress.

910
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,183
-Thanks.

911
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,119
-You look so pretty.

912
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:37,453
Where you going?

913
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,996
-Do you really wanna know?

914
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,798
-Of course.

915
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,401
-I'm going to play with Jack.

916
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,835
-Oh, is that the--

917
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,504
Is that the Paypal
one, or the--

918
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:55,305
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): No,
he's the other one.

919
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:56,272
-Oh, the nice one.

920
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:56,973
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Mhmm.

921
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:59,142
-Oh, good.

922
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,410
OK.

923
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,583
Are you sure you wanna go?

924
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,151
-Yeah, my mom called.

925
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:11,854
Um, she's getting evicted, so I
need to make her some cash.

926
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,624
-But I mean, if you--

927
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,259
I you want me to pay you
instead of the room.

928
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,963
I make $250 an hour.

929
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,298
-OK, well I know you're not
asking for my permission, so.

930
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:25,868
OK, bye.

931
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,003
-Bye.

932
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,338
-See ya.

933
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,544
Do you need a ride?

934
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,451
OK.

935
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,757
OK.

936
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:49,959
Are you sure you don't
need a ride home?

937
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,961
He always calls me a cab.

938
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,596
-Oh.

939
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,131
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN):
Thank you.

940
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,202
Bye.

941
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,470
-Bye.

942
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,040
-Hi Willy.

943
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,421
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Are
you kicking the table?

944
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:19,389
LOGAN (OFFSCREEN): Mhmm.

945
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:20,123
-Stop.

946
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,325
It's rude.

947
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,860
Thank you.

948
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,563
The road to dessert is paved
with chicken, sir.

949
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:28,965
-That's right.

950
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,667
I really want dessert.

951
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:31,668
-And you're gonna get some.

952
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,002
-Stop kicking the the table.

953
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,404
-The road to dessert is
also paved with beef.

954
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:35,271
Come on.

955
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,473
[door opening]

956
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,342
-There she is.

957
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,243
-McKenna, you hungry?

958
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,477
Plenty of food.

959
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:42,879
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN):
Uh, no thanks.

960
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,081
I'm gonna go straight to bed.

961
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,082
Good night!

962
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:47,784
-OK, sleep tight.

963
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,369
-Finally.

964
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,305
Oh my god, wow.

965
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:10,206
Look at you.

966
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:10,973
You look unbelievable.

967
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,075
-Hey baby.

968
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,409
Look what you did.

969
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:14,110
I'm proud.

970
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:15,378
-You did so good.

971
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,012
-Wow.

972
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:17,880
I'm so proud of you.

973
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,616
-Take it easy Horn
Dog McCrosby.

974
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,051
Look, Rachel's got
her boobies out.

975
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,986
-What the what, Rachel?

976
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:25,588
-Come over here.

977
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,322
Make a little Matty sandwich.

978
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,090
-OK.

979
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,291
-Hold on.

980
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,058
Everybody.

981
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,927
-All right, we gotta go.

982
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:31,794
-All right, where's
your mansicle?

983
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:32,562
-Uh, you mean Jeff?

984
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:33,796
He's over there.

985
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:34,831
-Sup Jeff Boyardee?

986
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:35,531
JENNIE (OFFSCREEN): This way.

987
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,232
This way.

988
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:36,866
Excuse me.

989
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,134
-Yeah?

990
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:38,968
-Don't freak out.

991
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,603
OK.

992
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:41,637
Get a bracelet on this one.

993
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,206
-Oh, yep.

994
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,109
-And, uh, I don't mean to be
unkind, you guys, but I sweat,

995
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,011
if I see anybody walking around
without a bracelet, I'm

996
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,413
gonna shit myself.

997
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,814
-Yeah, I--

998
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,082
I'm really sorry about what
happened last year.

999
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,150
-No, don't even worry
about it, because

1000
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:56,519
Actually, that was completely
your fault, but I'm

1001
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:57,987
totally over it.

1002
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,956
All right, I want you here with
Amanda, and just figure

1003
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,325
out between the two of you
who's gonna do bracelets,

1004
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:03,559
who's gonna take credit cards.

1005
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:04,694
-Uh, I'm--

1006
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,229
I'm doing hot dogs
with Stephanie.

1007
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,931
-Oh, honey, all due respect, you
kinda dropped the ball on

1008
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:12,301
the hot dogs, so I
gave it to Alisa.

1009
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:13,603
Sorry, I--

1010
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,104
I need to borrow my husband
for one second.

1011
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:15,938
I'm so sorry.

1012
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,606
-What?

1013
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:17,340
-You're leaving?

1014
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:18,074
-Yeah.

1015
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,443
-Because that's how it works.

1016
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,211
The women tell the men where to
set up the folding table,

1017
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,213
and the men set up the folding
table so men are free to go.

1018
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,214
-That's gross.

1019
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,582
-Just hang with Steph, OK?

1020
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,151
Talk shit about the moms.

1021
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:29,152
You guys'll have fun.

1022
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:30,019
-I'm off of hot dogs.

1023
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:33,723
-You don't get to make fun
of me and go surfing.

1024
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:35,124
I'm with fucking
kosher Amanda.

1025
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,227
This is fucking kosher Amanda's
face all the time.

1026
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,061
-You're right.

1027
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:39,962
That is her face.

1028
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,364
-Yeah.

1029
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:42,131
-That's her resting face.

1030
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,666
That is her face.

1031
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:44,634
-This is her baseline.

1032
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,002
-I wanna see how it feels.

1033
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,069
Huh, this is how it feels
to be kosher Amanda.

1034
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,538
-Mm-mm.

1035
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,705
-All right, I'm going surfing.

1036
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:50,406
-I can't believe you're
leaving me.

1037
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,374
-Bye.

1038
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,909
It's not fair, Jeff.

1039
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:17,934
-Seriously, I'm--

1040
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:20,269
I'm doing it.

1041
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,304
Whoa.

you feel better.

-Going to Jack's?

with a Z on the end.

Surf Godz with a Z.
I don't care Want.

00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:43,112
-Maybe.

1089
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,447
-Shelly.

1090
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,289
[knocking]

1091
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,824
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Coming.

1092
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,361
Hey, baby.

1093
00:49:58,363 --> 00:49:59,895
-Hi.

1094
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,241
-Hey.

1095
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:14,410
-How are you?

1096
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,445
-Good, how are you?

1097
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,413
-I'm really good.

1098
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:20,182
And, uh, this is my friend.

1099
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,117
-Savannah.

1100
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,985
-Savannah.

1101
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:25,021
-Hi Savannah.

1102
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:26,355
-Hi.

1103
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,193
-Can I take your coat?

1104
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,161
-Oh, please.

1105
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,463
Uh, thank you.

1106
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,032
-Wow.

1107
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,366
You're beautiful.

1108
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,370
May I get you a drink.

1109
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,339
-Uh, yes, thank you.

1110
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:43,973
-Scotch.

1111
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:45,274
-Yes.

1112
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,424
-Here you go.

1113
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:02,992
-Thank you.

1114
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:06,328
-Yeah.

1115
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,431
Savannah, there's no pressure.

1116
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:12,334
McKenna told me you wanted to,
um, share the experience, and

1117
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:14,670
I, uh, I really admire that.

1118
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,772
-Oh, thank you.

1119
00:51:16,774 --> 00:51:20,643
-I'd really love for
you to just watch.

1120
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,178
-Great, that's what I'll--

1121
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,446
That's what I'll do.

1122
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,481
-Totally get me off.

1123
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:27,049
Um.

1124
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:30,086
And, if, at any time, you feel
uncomfortable, then you just

1125
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:32,788
come on out here and, you know,
sit down and chill.

1126
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:36,492
-So, this won't be happening
in this space, then?

1127
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:39,528
It's gonna be somewhere else?

1128
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,496
Or is-- is it thi--

1129
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:41,697
Is this where it happens?

1130
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:42,898
-She's cute.

1131
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,300
You told me she's cute,
but she's cute.

1132
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:46,302
You're cute.

1133
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:47,269
No.

1134
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,404
It happens in the bedroom.

1135
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,472
-Ah, of course.

1136
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:50,873
-May I show you the bedroom?

1137
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,007
-Oh, you don't have to.

1138
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:52,908
I mean--

1139
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:57,179
whatever you guys normally--

1140
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:58,047
You know.

1141
00:51:58,049 --> 00:51:59,281
Whatever.

1142
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,082
You know.

1143
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,984
you go--

1144
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:04,253
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Why don't
you just come sit down?

1145
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,387
-She's sweet.

1146
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,656
Give some of this
to your friend.

1147
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:10,593
-Thank you.

1148
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,194
JACK (OFFSCREEN): I think
it's time for bedroom.

1149
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:13,395
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Let's go.

1150
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:13,996
JACK (OFFSCREEN): Come
on, let's go.

1151
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,297
-OK.

1152
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,832
You ready, Savannah?

1153
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,470
-Yeah.

1154
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,105
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN):
OK, let's go.

1155
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,476
-Get me hard.

1156
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,444
-I will.

1157
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:30,479
I will.

1158
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,481
You know that I will.

1159
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,421
-Sitting on this
chaise lounge.

1160
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:40,389
Beautiful.

1161
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,624
JACK (OFFSCREEN): Oh yeah.

1162
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,125
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Mm.

1163
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,131
-Oh, I'm sorry, one
more question.

1164
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:51,600
Sorry, I didn't mean to put
a damper on anything.

1165
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:52,368
-You're not.

1166
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,636
-OK, good.

1167
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:54,770
I just was, uh, wondering
how long these

1168
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:56,805
sessions usually last.

1169
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:58,340
-Uh, like about an
hour, right Jack?

1170
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,642
-Yeah, about an hour.

1171
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:00,543
-Oh, well great.

1172
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:01,877
Good.

1173
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:02,645
Don't have to make
a phone call.

1174
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:03,279
So, I'm good.

1175
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:03,979
Great.

1176
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:05,481
Wonderful.

1177
00:53:05,483 --> 00:53:07,149
Go about your business.

1178
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:11,020
I'll shut up now.

1179
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:11,820
-Oh yeah.

1180
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,822
Can you see, Savannah?

1181
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:15,457
Yes, I'm fine.

1182
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:16,392
I'm fine.

1183
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,860
-Yeah?

1184
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,261
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Oh my god,
you're getting so hard.

1185
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:20,529
-Fuck yeah, I am getting--

1186
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,664
MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Baby!

1187
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,431
-Are you sure you
can see, honey?

1188
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:23,399
-Mm-hm.

1189
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:25,534
-Oh yeah, that's it.

1190
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,336
I want you to see me.

1191
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,672
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): I do.

1192
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:34,176
-I don't think you can.

1193
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,512
[laughing]

1194
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:37,546
JACK (OFFSCREEN):
Come to daddy.

1195
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,116
-I'm coming!

1196
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,118
Hey.

1197
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,120
JACK (OFFSCREEN): Oh yeah.

1198
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,522
-Yeah?

1199
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:47,523
-Look at this, Savannah.

1200
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,058
Take it in.

1201
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:55,497
[moaning]

1202
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:58,500
-Savannah, can you
take my hand?

1203
00:53:58,502 --> 00:53:59,969
Come here.

1204
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:14,216
[moaning]

1205
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:21,290
[moaning]

1206
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,859
-Oh, yeah.

1207
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:34,069
[moaning]

1208
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:41,844
[moaning]

1209
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,389
-Are you OK?

1210
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:54,290
-Yeah.

1211
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,758
I think we should go.

1212
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,659
-Well, let me give
you your cash.

1213
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,193
-No, I don't want it.

1214
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,297
JEFF (OFFSCREEN): Babe?

1215
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:36,231
-Yeah?

1216
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,233
JEFF (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

1217
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,768
Guess what?

1218
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:44,640
JEFF (OFFSCREEN): I got up.

1219
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,608
-What are you talking about?

1220
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,609
JEFF (OFFSCREEN): I stood up.

1221
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:48,610
I got up.

1222
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:51,313
Your husband is a surfer.

1223
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,486
OK.

1224
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,360
What are you wearing?

1225
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:05,327
What is this outfit?

1226
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:06,495
What--

1227
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,097
why do you have all
this makeup on?

1228
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,601
-Um, after Craftacular,
I went to Nordstrom's.

1229
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,270
I let a very aggressive sales
lady do my makeup.

1230
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:16,038
-Huh.

1231
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,239
Where's Logan?

1232
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,775
-Jennie's playing with him.

1233
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:21,543
-OK.

1234
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,078
You look like someone else.

1235
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,512
Get in bed.

1236
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:06,121
[moaning]

1237
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,928
-Make sure you give your
brother a turn.

1238
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,363
Mazels, buddy.

1239
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:15,097
Tremendous spread.

1240
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,632
-Let's do it here.

1241
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:17,266
Makes life much easier.

1242
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,167
-Hey.

1243
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:19,401
Sorry, I just woke up.

1244
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:20,636
Sorry, I passed out.

1245
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:22,371
What are all these people
doing here?

1246
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:23,172
-What are you talking about?

1247
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:24,373
It's brunch.

1248
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,340
I told you I was going
to get bagels.

1249
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:26,442
-Do we have Half N' Half?

1250
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,543
-I-- no, I don't know.

1251
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:28,577
It's fine.

1252
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:29,645
Everyone's having a good time.

1253
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:30,879
-Hi, ladies.

1254
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,114
-Hi.

1255
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,115
-What's going on?

1256
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,116
-You are a mess.

1257
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:35,484
What's happening?

1258
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,152
-Did you just wake up?

1259
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,921
-Everyone's seeing things
under here.

1260
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,490
-Anyone tell you we were
coming here today?

1261
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:44,126
-I totally blanked on it.

1262
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,194
-Oh, no.

1263
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:46,728
-I've got to make my leave.

1264
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,064
You sure Mason has
growing foods?

1265
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,499
-I've got to go set up
for Women and Wine.

1266
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,500
-OK.

1267
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:53,035
-Women and Wine is tonight?

1268
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:54,837
-The men are playing poker, and
Logan can go to Meredith's

1269
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,371
to be with the boys
if he wants.

1270
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:59,608
-Oh, can McKenna come watch the
girls, just like, sit with

1271
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,044
them over at that,
uh, Amanda's?

1272
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,011
McKenna!

1273
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:05,848
Do you-- do you-- do you
have plans tonight?

1274
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:08,016
Like, do you want to come hang
out with like, four really

1275
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:10,452
cute girls, do a bunch
of dress up?

1276
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,254
It'd be so fun.

1277
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:12,888
-Sure.

1278
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,456
-I can do it.

1279
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:15,591
I can, don't worry about it.

1280
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:16,358
I will actually--
you know what?

1281
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,226
I'll just call--

1282
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:18,126
-No, no, it's fine.

1283
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:18,994
I had no plans tonight.

1284
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,063
-Oh, I love you.

1285
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:22,364
OK, good.

1286
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,332
-See you later.

1287
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,800
-Can we just do that?

1288
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:26,235
No, it's a great idea.

1289
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:27,002
-Yeah, yeah.

1290
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,403
-All right, I'm out of here.

1291
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,477
-I don't want McKenna to
sit the girls tonight.

1292
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:36,812
-What?

1293
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:38,881
-I don't want McKenna to
sit the girls tonight.

1294
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,391
Could you tell her it's not
gonna work out, or you found

1295
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:50,092
somebody else?

1296
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:53,395
-You want me to tell her?

1297
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:56,265
-Yes.

1298
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:57,966
I don't want to.

1299
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:58,634
-Well, wha--

1300
00:58:58,636 --> 00:58:59,768
I don't--

1301
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,603
-Just be my friend
and tell her.

1302
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,138
-Here you go.

1303
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,814
[knocking on door]

1304
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:14,349
Come in.

1305
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,757
Jennie called, and Meredith
found someone to watch the

1306
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:25,794
girls, so you're off the
hook for tonight.

1307
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,763
-Why?

1308
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:32,968
Honestly Rachel and I were
talking, and, I don't know.

1309
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,269
She's just a little
uncomfortable

1310
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,272
with the whole thing.

1311
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:38,807
-Rachel is uncomfortable?

1312
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,142
-Yeah.

1313
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:45,747
The girls are, um, really
young, you know?

1314
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,217
Two of them are in
preschool, so--

1315
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,119
-Yeah.

1316
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,354
Logan's in preschool.

1317
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:54,756
I babysit him all the time.

1318
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:59,461
Yeah, but just, you know,
other peoples' kids.

1319
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:02,030
-Right.

1320
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:05,133
-Plus, you don't really
know Amanda.

1321
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:06,468
-I've met Amanda.

1322
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,603
-Yeah.

1323
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,505
She's just, like,
super Jewish.

1324
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:15,377
Like, two sets of
plates Jewish.

1325
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:15,978
-OK.

1326
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,578
-OK?

1327
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,412
-Yeah.

1328
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:18,146
Cool.

1329
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:20,282
I get it.

1330
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,150
Um, so I have the night off.

1331
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:23,118
Right?

1332
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,453
-Yeah.

1333
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,358
Great.

1334
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,058
Well, thanks for
understanding.

1335
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,960
-Totally.

1336
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,029
-All right.

1337
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:35,430
See you soon.

1338
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:37,165
-Can you shut the
door, please?

1339
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,638
-Look how big you are.

1340
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,905
-So you're gonna go with--
what are you doing?

1341
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,474
You're in the driver's seat.

1342
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:48,410
Your son is driving
the car, Meredith.

1343
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:51,346
-Good girl.

1344
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:52,914
-Get back here!

1345
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,683
-Hi.

1346
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:57,419
[chattering]

1347
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:59,821
-Hi, pretty girl.

1348
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,323
I got you guys some presents.

1349
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,692
You're a princess tonight.

1350
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:08,363
Some nail polish, and some
bracelets, and some candy.

1351
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:09,965
A bunch of fun stuff.

1352
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,000
You're gonna be real
princesses, huh?

1353
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,336
-I'm so sorry I can't
be there.

1354
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,504
Somebody changed my plans.

1355
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,438
-What do you say?

1356
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,406
-Thank you.

1357
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:18,273
-Thank you.

1358
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:19,241
-You're so welcome.

1359
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:20,075
Have the best night ever.

1360
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:21,843
-Thanks, McKenna.

1361
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:22,878
Bye.

1362
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,246
-Look at these bracelets!

1363
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:35,290
-Hey.

1364
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:36,825
-Oh, peanuts.

1365
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:44,332
-Uh, guys are coming around
8:00, so, whenever.

1366
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,268
-Can I have a chip?

1367
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,803
-Yeah.

1368
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:51,339
-I'll be gone.

1369
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:53,041
-OK.

1370
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,342
-Have fun.

1371
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,682
-I'm here, I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

1372
01:02:00,684 --> 01:02:01,717
-What's up, my friend?

1373
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,418
-What's going on, my friend?

1374
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,453
-Yeah, it's good to see you.

1375
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:05,287
-That case looks so sinister.

1376
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,288
-Isn't it?

1377
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,156
-Well, there's guns in here.

1378
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:09,057
I'm just--

1379
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,392
-There's guns in here.

1380
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,326
-That's gonna be on
you, potentially.

1381
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:12,094
-Why?

1382
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:13,562
-You know why.

1383
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:14,896
-I didn't--

1384
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,998
I didn't know that was you.

1385
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,034
I cut him off. 'm sorry.

1386
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,136
-Are we ready to descend
to the gambling house?

1387
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:22,571
-Are these fingerlings?

1388
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:23,805
-Rach, are you seeing this?

1389
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:26,041
-Oh, it's beautiful.

1390
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:30,846
-So, this is where we
will Women and Wine.

1391
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:32,614
-It's very French, right?

1392
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,149
Is that what we're
going for here?

1393
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:36,251
The only thing that's
not French, no

1394
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,219
kidding, is the piano.

1395
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:40,122
It was my grandfather's--

1396
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,523
-Somebody had a five.

1397
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,291
-Fuck you.

1398
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:46,495
-So now it's to him, because
he's left of the dealer.

1399
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:47,496
[chattering]

1400
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:48,563
-Man, fuck.

1401
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:50,098
You're betting a million
dollars.

1402
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:54,669
It should be pronounced
"yuca," as in Yucatan.

1403
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:56,404
-Well, I guess it's in
most tequilas and--

1404
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,210
-It's 7:59.

1405
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,211
7:59.

1406
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,813
-Can I ask a question?

1407
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:07,682
-Where'd the fuck that fucking
ante come from?

1408
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:12,154
-Jennifer's into guys who are
approximately 100 pounds

1409
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:13,188
overweight.

1410
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,258
-They are full figured women.

1411
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,559
-Seriously, dude.

1412
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:18,527
Rachel found her.

1413
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,061
-Rachel found her.

1414
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,835
-Yeah.

1415
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,703
-We should have a
toast, ladies.

1416
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:30,105
-OK, let's toast it up.

1417
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:31,006
-We should have a toast!

1418
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:33,408
-To long marriages.

1419
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,309
-And long--

1420
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,043
-Long marriage!

1421
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:36,278
-And children.

1422
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,246
-Cheers.

1423
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:39,581
-Wait, wait, wait.

1424
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,582
This is, we have to look
each other in the eye.

1425
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:41,216
-What?

1426
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:41,817
-We did.

1427
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,185
We have to go like this.

1428
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:43,952
-This is

1429
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,353
We don't do it.

1430
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:46,054
-So make it real.

1431
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:47,789
OK.

1432
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,090
It's just something she
read in "Real Simple."

1433
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:51,293
-She's making everyone
have these moments.

1434
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,060
-OK.

1435
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:53,962
I'm sorry, but--

1436
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:55,030
-I'm so glad.

1437
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:55,831
-Cheers.

1438
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,532
-Cheers.

1439
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,201
-But, speaking of which,
if you want to go--

1440
01:03:59,203 --> 01:03:59,835
-Jennie.

1441
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:00,402
-Hi.

1442
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:01,403
-Jennie.

1443
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:02,571
-Speaking of, you want to--

1444
01:04:02,573 --> 01:04:03,605
I'm looking at you.

1445
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:05,140
-No, you need to look at her.

1446
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:06,141
You need to hold her hand.

1447
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,109
-I just looked at her!

1448
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:09,444
Oh my god.

1449
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:17,786
[laughter]

1450
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:29,497
[laughter]

1451
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,905
-When you get home and you take
off those things, there's

1452
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:40,275
There's no elegant way
to pull them off.

1453
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:41,409
And your whole body just--

1454
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:43,111
-Pot's getting too
good, right?

1455
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:44,479
Remember you used to be
able to smoke a joint?

1456
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:46,514
You smoke your joint
now, you die.

1457
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:47,482
-Hi.

1458
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:49,417
-Hello.

1459
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:50,018
-Hey.

1460
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,986
-Hi.

1461
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:52,721
-Thought you were going out?

1462
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:54,656
-Oh, I changed my mind.

1463
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,458
Look at this.

1464
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,993
You guys need company?

1465
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,162
-Yeah.

1466
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:03,498
Yeah, all right.

1467
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,733
-There was a thing that--

1468
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,268
-Stephanie, why are
you not drinking?

1469
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,970
-I know that normally I am a
borderline alcoholic, but, I

1470
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:12,307
wasn't gonna tell you
guys, I am preggers.

1471
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:15,243
I'm p It was a total surprise.

1472
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,111
-Oh, my god.

1473
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,412
-Yeah, so anyway--

1474
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,314
-Oh, my god!

1475
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:20,982
-Amazing.

1476
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:23,518
Oh, you guys are gonna
have two kids?

1477
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,686
That's good for me!

1478
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,658
Oh my god!

1479
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,559
You're trying to get
mad about three.

1480
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:33,528
-Yeah.

1481
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,830
-Not me, said Logan.

1482
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,067
-OK.

1483
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:40,335
-Anyway.

1484
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:40,969
-That is awesome.

1485
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:42,170
-Wow.

1486
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:43,171
-Congratulations.

1487
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:44,606
-That is, I mean--

1488
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:45,774
-Congratulations.

1489
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:46,541
-Thank you guys, Thank
you so much.

1490
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:47,375
Thank you.

1491
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:47,976
-When are you due?

1492
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:48,944
-March.

1493
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:51,446
-Wow.

1494
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:52,914
-Thank you.

1495
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,950
-Has anybody here wondered what
their aborted children

1496
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,518
would be like?

1497
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,552
-Oh, my god.

1498
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,954
-What is happening right now?

1499
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:02,590
Have we all not had-- who's
had an abortion here?

1500
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:03,458
And We've all--

1501
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,159
-Who hasn't?

1502
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:05,160
-Yeah.

1503
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:06,494
-We've all had the abortion.

1504
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,830
-I fucked so many people
in my 20's, you guys.

1505
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:10,165
It's like, all I did
was fuck people.

1506
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:11,599
-Everybody fucked everybody.

1507
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,567
-Exactly.

1508
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:13,668
-That's why you have 20's.

1509
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,803
-That's why you have
your 20's.

1510
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,171
I fucked the shit
out of my 20's.

1511
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:17,505
-The 20's are for fucking.

1512
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:18,873
-Thank you!

1513
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,208
-And they're for asking your
parents for money.

1514
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,044
-I want to hear about
everybody's abortions!

1515
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:24,446
-Guys, it's not gonna be--
it's not gonna be

1516
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:25,680
a super late night.

1517
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:27,115
So we should wrap it up.

1518
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:28,516
Who wants another drink?

1519
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:29,751
-This is--

1520
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,786
-I will, uh, I would
love a little bit.

1521
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:32,921
Thank you, darling.

1522
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:34,322
-I'm gonna go get
us some whiskey.

1523
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,457
I'll see you guys in a minute.

1524
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,224
Don't you dare look
at my cards.

1525
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:37,192
-We will not.

1526
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:38,326
-That would never happen.

1527
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,128
-We will not look
at your cards.

1528
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,664
-Everything but her cards.

1529
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,366
-Did she just go
get us drinks?

1530
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,871
She's the best nanny
in the world.

1531
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,543
-So I was a freshman at USC.

1532
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,112
-Oh, god.

1533
01:06:57,114 --> 01:07:01,182
-I was in my first week, and I
was in my dorm room, getting

1534
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:04,319
ready for my sorority rush,
because that's what all the

1535
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:06,621
cool kids were doing.

1536
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,158
And this guy, oh my god,
was it Mike or John?

1537
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,127
-No names.

1538
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:12,761
-John.

1539
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:14,095
Mike?

1540
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:14,896
-Where is this going?

1541
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:16,631
-Not anywhere good.

1542
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,967
-I fucking don't
know his name.

1543
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:21,236
-He just came walking on
into my dorm room.

1544
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:22,103
-Anyway, it happened, and--

1545
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:24,806
didn't even knock on
my dorm room door.

1546
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:26,941
-OK, I definitely don't like
where this is going.

1547
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:30,078
-Yeah, but he came in, he
told me I was pretty.

1548
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,614
And made me feel really
sorry for him.

1549
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:33,515
-And then he, and then
he raped you.

1550
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:34,549
-Started kissing me.

1551
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,850
-Is that where this is going?

1552
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:39,120
You guys, it's not-- this
is not a rape story!

1553
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:41,790
-It sounds a whole lot
like a rape story.

1554
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:44,292
-I literally just like-- that's
what s college is.

1555
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:45,193
-This is--

1556
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,594
-Nobody asks in college!

1557
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:47,762
-Could we just pretend like
it's my baby shower?

1558
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:48,997
I think that's appropriate.

1559
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:51,666
-It wasn't like a stranger,
you guys.

1560
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:54,903
We met in the cafeteria.

1561
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,504
-Oh, god.

1562
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:58,640
-What is going on with
you tonight?

1563
01:07:58,642 --> 01:08:02,544
-No, we managed to get through
this fucking amazing thing

1564
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,212
they used to serve.

1565
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,814
Oh, my god.

1566
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:10,452
It was like this foamy, light
green, whipped jello shit with

1567
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:11,352
like--

1568
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:12,120
-Oh, I remember that.

1569
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:12,987
What was that?

1570
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:14,389
-What was that called?

1571
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:14,989
-Fantasia.

1572
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:16,591
-It's Ambrosia.

1573
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:17,425
-It was Ambrosia.

1574
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,960
-It was Ambrosia.

1575
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:20,028
-You're doing it.

1576
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,696
-I make that all the time.

1577
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,031
-You still make it?

1578
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:25,467
-Where do you get the recipe
for something like that?

1579
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:26,401
-She got it from her bubba.

1580
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:27,368
-She just--

1581
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,503
-In my head.

1582
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:29,904
-What's your secret?

1583
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,873
-Um, there's really no secret.

1584
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,308
You just put stuff in it.

1585
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,277
It's jello, and then you just
add whatever you have.

1586
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,012
You know, fruit.

1587
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,515
Nuts.

1588
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:42,083
-You put nuts in the jello?

1589
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:44,185
You can put nuts in there.

1590
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:46,521
Cherries.

1591
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:47,155
Uh--

1592
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:48,356
-Nuts?

1593
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:49,891
-Yeah.

1594
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:50,725
Oh, stop it.

1595
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:52,060
Would you stop it?

1596
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:53,528
-When you bite down on a
piece of jello, you're

1597
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:54,596
not expecting a nut.

1598
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:55,830
That's what I'm saying.

1599
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:58,199
-So I got pregnant
by this kid.

1600
01:08:58,201 --> 01:08:59,434
-Oh, god, we're still on it.

1601
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:01,169
-And then I had to go
back home to my

1602
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,871
parents' house in Chicago.

1603
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:04,539
Had to go to the local clinic.

1604
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:05,707
Got an abortion!

1605
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,175
-Did your parents know?

1606
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:07,909
-Yeah.

1607
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,010
My mom knew.

1608
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:11,646
-I had to literally stay home
the rest of my freshman year,

1609
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,981
and I missed my Freshman year.

1610
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:14,282
Didn't even go back to fucking
USC, because I

1611
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:16,851
couldn't face that kid.

1612
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,154
Well No!

1613
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:22,190
So I just stayed home on
my parents' couch.

1614
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:26,361
I watched soap operas for
a year of my life.

1615
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:28,129
My god.

1616
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:29,130
Oh, my god, you guys.

1617
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:29,964
Soap operas.

1618
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:31,666
They're gone.

1619
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,369
They're all gone.

1620
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:36,337
[raucous chatter]

1621
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:37,539
-She has returned!

1622
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:42,243
She has returned with
beverages and--

1623
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:43,778
look at those tits too.

1624
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,182
-Come on!

1625
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,149
There we go!

1800
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:38,065
-You told me to go.

1801
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,500
I told you to let me go.

1802
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,401
-Are you OK?

1803
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:41,802
-No I'm not fucking OK.

1804
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:44,338
I told you to stop for a second
so I could cross.

1805
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,573
-I misread your signal.

1806

-You're missing everything
these days.

01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:47,341
You miss everything.

said I should--

-What was she doing
in our house?

1811
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:54,381
I worked so hard to buy us a
beautiful house, and you--

1812
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:55,783
Did you want me to fuck her?

1813
01:20:55,785 --> 01:20:57,218
Just tell me honestly.

1814
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:57,818
-No.

1815
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:59,353

Did you want to fuck her?

Just tell me honestly.

I won't be mad.

she was gonna do.

-You need something.

You need to figure
out what it is.

1851

You said you didn't
want another kid?

1852
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,496

thought I was dying.

Because I am now in a situation

means something to me.

1864
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,556
-OK.

1865
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:11,492
-Not out of this
marriage, Jeff.

1866
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:13,093
I want out of this head!

1867
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:14,094
I want out of this life.

It's fine.

-So, I'm glad I saw you, I
really wanted to reach out,

1881
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:10,217
but I also just wanted to
give you your space.

1882

Also, tell you I'm so sorry.

haven't really been living in

where I come from in the

-I think that's why I thought
that I could help her.

1887
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:33,140
-OK, Rach, but you had
to know better.

1888
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:38,645
Um, I meant to email you about
your room at Big Bear, for

1889
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:40,114
your family.

1890
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:42,049
I'm giving it to Amanda's family
because, you know, it's

1891
01:23:42,051 --> 01:23:44,418
gonna be awkward for the boy's
this time at the lake without

1892
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:48,155
their dad, so just kind of have
to be really strong for

1893
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:51,125
them, and I can't really do
that if you're there, so.

1894
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,232
-Amanda.

1895
01:23:58,234 --> 01:23:58,999
Hey.

1896
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:01,301
-Hi.

1897
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:04,705
-I know I got really drunk the
other night and I know I said

1898
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:06,640
some pretty awful things.

1899
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:07,975
I didn't mean to call you--

1900
01:24:07,977 --> 01:24:10,110
-Kosher Amanda.

1901
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,413
I'm actually not kosher.

1902
01:24:12,415 --> 01:24:14,982
-Oh, I think I just assumed.

1903
01:24:14,984 --> 01:24:16,417
-Sam keeps kosher, but
I love to cook.

1904
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:18,218
I love to cook.

1905
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,989
And there are so many things to
cook that are not kosher.

1906
01:24:21,991 --> 01:24:25,225
-But I do light the candles
on Friday nights.

1907
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:27,995
I don't know why that gives me
such a bad rap around here.

1908
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,433
Anyway.

1909
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:33,934
So, I'll see you.

1910
01:24:33,936 --> 01:24:35,269

1911
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,740

1918
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:14,341

with those moms anyway.

a war reporter.

1922

-I remember.

1923
01:25:26,856 --> 01:25:28,188
-You do?

1924
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,357
I said that, didn't I?

01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:31,625
-Yes, you said it.

doesn't remember.

I take copious notes.

going to leave you?

inappropriate.

with someone and take

1936

them for granted?

1937
01:26:23,746 --> 01:26:25,846
I did that with her.

1938
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:31,552
The moment I met her, I said to
her, I want to be looking
