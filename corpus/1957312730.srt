1
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:31,770
Excuse me, ma'am.

2
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:32,771
Excuse me?

3
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,079
Why are you going to the
Attorney General's office?

4
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,126
- Because I need
help with my kids.

5
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,477
My son's father works
for the Post Office,

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,044
making 28 dollars an hour.

7
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046
I need some help.

8
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,048
I have to walk to work,

9
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,484
I can't even afford bus fair.

10
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,624
- Hi
there, excuse me ma'am,

11
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:00,886
where's your kids' father?

12
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:03,933
I don't know where
he lives, but...

13
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:05,630
I do know he hasn't
help me financially.

14
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:06,762
I mean not that I need it,

15
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:07,893
but,

16
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,721
he hasn't seen his
son in six months.

17
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:22,082
- What
would like to say

18
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,083
to your kids' father?

19
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:28,523
- While you're out there
living with your girlfriend,

20
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,093
our son needs your health
insurance and benefits.

21
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:35,747
I need some help,

22
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:37,532
please.

23
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,998
My name is David Lee.

24
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,219
I'm a patent attorney for
Wallace and Wallace law firm.

25
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,353
Although the hours are long,

26
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,225
it's a very rewarding career.

27
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:17,795
I'm also a single father of
a little girl named Mary.

28
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,146
My daughter is my
heart and soul,

29
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,628
and I would lay down
my life for her,

30
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,196
no questions asked.

31
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,895
Even though it's hard
getting out of bed,

32
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,855
how do you make
it through the day

33
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:37,293
not knowing when you
will see your child?

34
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,342
I am truly lost without her.

35
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,084
- Kelly?

36
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:14,172
You up?

37
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,396
- I am.

38
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:22,616
- All right, well
get up and get dressed baby.

39
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,008
Breakfast is ready.

40
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:24,792
- Okay mom.

41
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,508
- My name
is Monica Sosa.

42
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:48,076
I'm a nurse assistant
in the Medical Center.

43
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,210
And, unfortunately I
work the night shift.

44
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,997
What makes my job so
hard is the walking.

45
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,653
and I walk at least
30 miles a week.

46
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,700
But, walking
through Hermann Park

47
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:08,139
gives me a peace of mind
of how things used to be.

48
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,146
Ricky and I used to
bring Travis here.

49
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,149
I would watch him play baseball,

50
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,500
and I would just read my books.

51
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,285
Oh my God,

52
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,854
I really do miss my family.

53
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:35,210
Ricky started changing
right before my eyes.

54
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,821
He started buying new clothes,

55
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:40,389
and coming home late, and later,

56
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,522
until he just moved out.

57
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,222
Susan Martinez,
she's my coworker,

58
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,877
said I should go to the
child support office

59
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,139
and they would make him pay.

60
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:55,230
Well, today's the day
I will finally do it.

61
00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:00,975
Ricky is out of control, and I
have to face a harsh reality.

62
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,108
My husband is with
another woman,

63
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:08,852
and he's not coming home.

64
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:14,989
The forecast,

65
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,991
plenty of sunshine through today
with seasonal temperatures.

66
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,558
We should reach our normal high

67
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,169
of about 82 degrees
by this afternoon.

68
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,563
Clear skies tonight
with a low near 70.

69
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,216
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow,

70
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,132
sticky and humid
with a high of 96,

71
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,656
with the winds out of the east

72
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,527
at 14 miles per hour,

73
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,921
it's currently 75 degrees.

74
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,594
- Jason.

75
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:57,466
Jason, get up.

76
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,243
Damn it!

77
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,160
What the hell?

78
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,605
Jason, Jason wake up,
it's time to go to school.

79
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,260
Boy, I know you hear me.

80
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,000
Get up.

81
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,442
Jason, get your ass up now.

82
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,965
- I'm up mom, I'm up.

83
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,926
- Get dressed and
come get some breakfast.

84
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,146
- I don't want no more oatmeal,
it makes my stomach hurt.

85
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,061
- Boy, I ain't got time to
argue with you right now.

86
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,323
Just like your father.

87
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,498
Get dressed.

88
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,067
All you do is eat and sleep.

89
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,417
I gotta fight with
you to get out of bed.

90
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,944
I have to call in to work today,

91
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,033
and now my paycheck
is gonna be short.

92
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,730
We're about to get kicked out

93
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,210
and I get no help from your dad.

94
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:42,049
- Wow,
what a spectacular view.

95
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,487
You know I've lived
in these apartments

96
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,097
for the last three years.

97
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:51,667
This city is my home.

98
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,501
This day started
like any other day.

99
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,635
Cold breakfast, hot shower,

100
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,681
then I head to work.

101
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,816
My life was pretty
simple back then.

102
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:14,385
However, that all
changed when I separated

103
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,344
from my daughter's mother.

104
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,695
I thought breaking up was easy.

105
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:23,699
I thought moving on
was a piece of cake.

106
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,224
Boy, was I wrong.

107
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,272
- David, this is John.

108
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,969
I just wanted to
congratulate you

109
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:35,580
on an excellent job
on our client case.

110
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,321
Because of your hard work,

111
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:40,237
we reached settlement
of 12 million dollars.

112
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,197
David, it's attorneys
like you that we need

113
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,068
in our executive administration,

114
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:48,202
and we'd like to promote to
vice president of Wallace firm.

115
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,465
Let's talk about it
over lunch today.

116
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,774
- John
Wallace, that's my boss,

117
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:58,299
and the CEO of Wallace
and Wallace Law Firm.

118
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:02,129
He's a good man,
and a fair boss.

119
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,784
Now where was I?

120
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:09,745
Oh yeah, Stephanie,
my daugher's mother.

121
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,922
We separated about
six months ago,

122
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,099
and it's a very
complicated breakup.

123
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:19,320
If you have children
with your ex-spouses,

124
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,322
please understand,

125
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,978
this will be on of
the most trying times

126
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,109
in your life,

127
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,286
and for your children.

128
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,561
- Thanks for the food
mom, it's really good.

129
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,347
- Sure honey, I know
it's your favorite.

130
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,437
I wanted to do something
special for you today.

131
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,481
- Thanks.

132
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,014
- So, you ready for
your game today?

133
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,711
- Yeah, I am.

134
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,148
I am so excited about this team.

135
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,193
- You should be.

136
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,977
It's been 25 years
since our team

137
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,283
went to the district
championship.

138
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:14,810
What's wrong honey?

139
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:15,985
- Nothing.

140
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,119
- Are you sure?

141
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,212
- I really need dad
to be at my game.

142
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,955
Can you please make
sure he's there,

143
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,174
please?

144
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:33,481
- Yeah, sure Kelly.

145
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,222
I'll reach out to your dad
and see if he can come.

146
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,877
But, you know he
works late sometimes.

147
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:39,966
Okay.

148
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,906
Well, if you're finished
with your breakfast,

149
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,037
let's get to school.

150
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,386
- Okay, let me go
grab my backpack.

151
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,213
- Okay.

152
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:17,585
- Hey mom.

153
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:18,803
How are you?

154
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:19,979
- I'm fine.

155
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,023
How are you?

156
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,851
- I'm okay, just taking a break.

157
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,593
I'm heading to the
child support office.

158
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,989
I just can't keep doing
this anymore, mom.

159
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,947
Ricky's gonna have to pay,

160
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,123
and he's gonna have
a huge surprise

161
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,125
when his wages are
garnished for child support.

162
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,130
- Monica, you
don't need his money.

163
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:44,046
Why don't you just
move back to Austin?

164
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,790
- Mom, come on you know that
Travis is in school here.

165
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,748
And he's settled in Houston.

166
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,230
Plus, it's time I take
charge of my life,

167
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:56,189
and that's starting today.

168
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,234
You know, I may not
have a car right now,

169
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:00,889
but in a few weeks I'm gonna
have money for bus fare,

170
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,717
and that's just gonna
be such a huge help.

171
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:06,329
- I just don't
like to see you struggle.

172
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:09,376
Travis is my only grandson,

173
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,464
and he would be better off

174
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,379
living here with
his grandparents,

175
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,468
until you establish yourself.

176
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:17,297
- Mom, it's gonna be okay.

177
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,170
I'm gonna be okay,
Travis is gonna be okay.

178
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:24,217
Ricky just met this woman
and completely changed.

179
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,395
But it's gonna be fine,
it's gonna be okay.

180
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,789
Listen, they are so slow at
the child support office,

181
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,269
and I want to be
first in line so,

182
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:34,662
can I call you later?

183
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:36,403
- Okay.

184
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,058
Be careful.

185
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:40,624
- I will mom.

186
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,799
- I love you.

187
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:42,800
- I love you, too.

188
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,118
- Come on.

189
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,121
- Please leave
a message after the tone.

190
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,168
- Stephanie, it's David.

191
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:52,087
Stephanie, why aren't you
picking up my phone calls?

192
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:56,439
We both made mistakes
in this relationship.

193
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,703
I just think it's unfair.

194
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:06,710
Can you at least let me
hear her voice, please?

195
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,236
Call me.

196
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,884
- No mom, alimony is not enough.

197
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,625
He needs to pay
child support, too.

198
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,583
And he's the one
who cheated on me.

199
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,542
Hold on.

200
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,544
Kelly, let's go.

201
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,067
You don't want to
be late for school.

202
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,080
- Okay, mom.

203
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,257
- Okay mom, I'll call you later

204
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,519
and let you know how it goes.

205
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:18,695
Okay, bye.

206
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,439
Ready?

207
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,266
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,224
- Let's go.

209
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,630
- Come on
Jason, hurry up,

210
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,675
I can't be late today.

211
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,440
Uh, Mom.

212
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:11,618
Coach Thomas said
I need 180 dollars

213
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:13,228
for new football equipment.

214
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,056
- Jason, I don't have it.

215
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,927
I don't even have
money for groceries.

216
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,755
Coach Thomas is just
gonna have to understand.

217
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,324
- But mom if I don't have it,
I get kicked off the team.

218
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,283
Man, we don't never
have any money.

219
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:25,893
- Boy, what did I say?

220
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,329
I don't have it.

221
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,157
I got too much going on
right now, I don't have it.

222
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:31,725
- Yes ma'am.

223
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,162
I guess I'll just get
kicked off the team.

224
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,511
- Boy, what'd you say?

225
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,514
Man finish your
breakfast, we gotta go.

226
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,258
Jason, what are you doing?

227
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,259
- Mom!

228
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:45,391
- Stop messing around.

229
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:46,087
Let's go.

230
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:03,757
- Dave, it's Taylor.

231
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,195
- Come on in man,
the door is open.

232
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:15,812
What's going on my brother?

233
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,074
Have a seat man.

234
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:20,121
Can I get you anything,
water, orange juice?

235
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,340
- Orange juice be good.

236
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,429
- All right,
coming up my brother.

237
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:26,997
- Hey thanks.

238
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,434
- Absolutely man.

239
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,396
All right Taylor, you said
you wanted to talk to me.

240
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,093
What's on your mind?

241
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,880
- Dave, I'm worried about you.

242
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,142
How you doing?

243
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,058
Ugh!

244
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:46,756
- How am I doing?

245
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,977
I'm not doing very well, man.

246
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,153
I'm still dealing
with this breakup.

247
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,198
- It's been six
months since you guys

248
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,504
went your separate ways.

249
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:58,028
That woman definitely
has it out for you.

250
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,074
Why can't she just move on?

251
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,467
- You know what?

252
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,990
It's because she keeps
talking about counseling,

253
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:06,080
and therapy, like we're
getting married or something.

254
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,126
You know what I
don't like Taylor,

255
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,085
is when parents break up,

256
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:12,565
they put their
kids in the middle

257
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,175
of all of their foolishness.

258
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,612
Mary has two parents,

259
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:18,788
but since we went
our separate ways,

260
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,137
I don't get to see her.

261
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,748
- Dave, that's crazy.

262
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:24,490
From my perspective,

263
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,406
I can tell that this woman
knows this is hurting you.

264
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,495
If you were one of
those deadbeat dads,

265
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,627
she'd be throwing
Mary all in your face.

266
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:34,848
- Yeah, but I'm
not a deadbeat dad.

267
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,633
You know that, and I know that.

268
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:38,678
And you know what?

269
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,070
She knows that.

270
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,725
No one loves Mary
more than I do.

271
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:45,336
I'm my daughter's biggest fan.

272
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,990
- I hear you, I hear you man.

273
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,252
It's just wrong.

274
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,559
I don't know how you
can go six months

275
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:52,213
without seeing your kid.

276
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:54,911
If it were me, that would
tear my apart inside.

277
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,654
And what about Mary, how's
she dealing with this?

278
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,048
I can't believe there
are women out there

279
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,442
that would use their kids
as leverage against you,

280
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:04,834
a good father.

281
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:08,664
- But you know what, man?

282
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,145
I'm gonna be honest with you.

283
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,757
I really believe she
loves our daughter.

284
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:16,455
She's a good mother.

285
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:21,242
But I am starting to second
guess her level of integrity.

286
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:25,551
Taylor, why am I
not seeing Mary?

287
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,816
Why is she avoiding
my phone calls, man?

288
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,687
I don't get to see her.

289
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,081
Her grandparents
haven't seen her

290
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:37,432
Hell man, nobody from
my side of the family

291
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,260
gets to see Mary.

292
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:43,264
- Well, you know what they say,

293
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,529
hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

294
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,618
There is no one
angrier than a woman

295
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,141
that's been rejected in love.

296
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:55,232
- Damn man, I wasn't trying
to go through this, man.

297
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:57,931
Ugh!

298
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:02,022
Child support office been
staring me in my face.

299
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,505
However, I cannot
avoid the inevitable.

300
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,206
Dude, I have to let you go man.

301
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,121
Work is piling up my brother.

302
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,821
So see yourself out man.
Got to call into to work.

303
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,475
I'm not going in today.

304
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,870
Well, we still on for tonight?

305
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,220
If Houston doesn't
win this game,

306
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:27,569
they're not gonna
make the playoffs.

307
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:31,834
Man, the last thing
on my mind right now

308
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,706
is hangin' at
Sammy's Sports Grill,

309
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,186
and nursin' a couple
of beers with you.

310
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,232
Man, why don't you just
give me a call tonight,

311
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:40,364
and let's just see
where my head is, dude.

312
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:41,583
You know I always got your back.

313
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,716
- Hey man, I appreciate you man.

314
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,630
All right

315
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:45,979
I'll talk to you man.

316
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:46,545
Okay.

317
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,197
All right.

318
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:28,238
- It's disgusting.

319
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,414
- It's really that bad?

320
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:33,504
- I don't even
know why I drink this mess.

321
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,031
Mm.

322
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,076
- This coffee is terrible.

323
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,209
- Yeah, Rhonda made it.

324
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,253
- Rhonda?

325
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,386
- Yeah,
tell me about it.

326
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:48,868
- I freakin' hate this place.

327
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,565
- Well, I love it, you know why?

328
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,262
- Why?

329
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:56,049
- Because I always put
some magic in my coffee.

330
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,661
- What, that's not
a good idea. What?

331
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,271
- It works, yeah.

332
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:02,446
- Jesus Christ.

333
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,926
- Rhonda supplies it.

334
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,363
- Hey y'all know I'm security
right, that's not good.

335
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,626
- You don't even have a gun.

336
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,149
- But I have a whistle.

337
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,368
- I know how to blow.

338
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:13,240
- Lunch
break you know,

339
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:14,633
you know we get our party on.

340
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:16,678
- She loves to party.

341
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:17,636
You haven't seen her.

342
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,985
- You all party together?

343
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,857
What kind of place
am I workin' at?

344
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,119
Jesus Christ.

345
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:24,077
- Don't ask me.

346
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,340
I mean I love it.

347
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,037
- See why I'm so
friendly by the end of the day?

348
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,649
- I just thought that
you was a perky person.

349
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,564
Jessica Bradley, line two.

350
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:35,175
Jessica Bradley, line two.

351
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,831
- Well guys, it's
about that time.

352
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,360
- Please don't tell me we
have to open up these doors.

353
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:48,014
- Gotta help
some ladies today.

354
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,843
- And guess what,
you get the honors.

355
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:51,539
- Me?

356
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:52,322
- Go open the door.

357
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,326

482
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,855

00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:12,082
Please fill out this

487
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,176
- Yes I do.

488
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:24,051
- Okay, then please go

Okay, now that was weird.

494
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,986
Fellas, don't think because you

00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:48,031
file child support on yourself,

496
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:51,121
that you deserve
a pat on the back.

497
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:56,039
News flash, there's no
homecoming for being

498
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,694
responsible for your children.

499
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,003

500
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,354
- Oh my God, girl.

501
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:08,138
You're not gonna believe this.

502
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:10,967
We finally got our unicorn.

503
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:14,623

May I see it?

517
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:50,268
Wow, nice.

00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,444
My name is David.

519
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:53,488

521
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,275

That's my daughter's name.

523
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:01,409
- Really?

524
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,197

525
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,897
Ma'am, you have a
beautiful daughter.

- Thank you.

527
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:15,293
- Absolutely.

528
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:19,645
Ever had a person

529
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:22,952
that didn't like you
for whatever reason?

530
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:25,868
They just picked on you,

531
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,915
for every little thing.

532
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:34,660
Well this my friend,
is a hot mess.

533
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:37,271
- Excuse me?

534
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:42,363

00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:44,539
- How ya doin'?

00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:48,413
- I'm good.

537
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:55,550
- I don't mean to be rude and
all up in your damn business,

538
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:58,988
but did I hear you
say you came here

539
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,468
to file child
support on yourself?

540
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:08,171
- Yes, I did, and I do
think you're being rude.

541
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,738
But if you must ask,

542
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:12,828
I'm no longer with
my daughter's mother,

543
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:14,090
and I'm just here to take care

544
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:17,137
of my financial
responsibilities.

545
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,356
Do you mind?

546
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:23,491
- What the hell?

547
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:27,800
Here this man come to file
child support on himself,

548
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:31,194
and me, I can't find my
kid's sorry ass father.

549
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:33,632
- What, what's
going on over there?

550
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:34,894
Everything good?

551
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,636
- I'm fine, thank you.

552
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,855
- I got my eye on you.

553
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,030
- Michael Johnson?

554
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,119
- It's about damn time.

555
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,258
- Come on back.

556
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,564
- Does it always take this long?

557
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:54,392
This has been horrible.

558
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:56,263
I just can't believe this.

559
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:57,307
- Come on
in and have a seat.

560
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:58,308
- laughing

561
00:39:58,352 --> 00:39:59,222
- Oh great!

562
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,310
- Surprise!

563
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:01,660
- What is this,
some kind of ambush?

564
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,966
What the hell is
Michelle doing here?

565
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,446
- Michael, I'm not
here to argue with you.

566
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,404
- Here, you want my wallet?

567
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,666
- Mister Johnson?

568
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,363
She legally does have
a right to be here.

569
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,365
- Fine, fine here.

570
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,801
Here are my pay stubs.

571
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,978
Here's my ID.

572
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:17,589
You can have a quart of
blood too, if you need it.

573
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:18,894
- Thank you, Mister Johnson.

574
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,984
- God,
this is ridiculous.

575
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:22,768
- God!

576
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,553
What are you doing here, anyway?

577
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:26,902
Really?

578
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,948
- I'm gonna stay one
step ahead of you, buddy.

579
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,308
- They
are trying to screw you, man.

580
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,919
Jessica Bradley, line two.

581
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,791
Jessica Bradley, line two.

582
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:47,880
That's a lot of clicking,

583
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:49,969
as long as it's under 500
bucks, I should be okay.

584
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,103
So, Miss Bradley?

585
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:57,019
How much is it, what's
the amount gonna be?

586
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:58,804
I mean, don't put me
in the poor house.

587
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,154
- Please let me explain.

588
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:03,461
All right.

589
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,462
- Here it comes.

590
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:07,943
- So, because you owe
back child support,

591
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:11,033
we divide into five years,
at 280 dollars a month.

592
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:13,427
So that's in addition
to your monthly payment

593
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,124
of 1000 dollars per month.

594
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:16,604
- What?

595
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:19,955
- So, your garnished wages
is 1,280 dollars a month,

596
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,043
based on your
- Oh my God.

597
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:21,914
current salary.

598
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:23,176
- No, this is unacceptable.

599
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,222
I can't pay that,
I can't pay that.

600
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,876
- I'm sorry sir,

601
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,095
that is the amount--
- No, this is unacceptable.

602
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,270
- Based on
your current salary.

603
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:30,966
- It's unacceptable,
I can't pay this.

604
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,054
This is ridiculous.

605
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,578
1,280 bucks a month!

606
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,535
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,841
Are you out of your mind?

608
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,191
Are you kidding me?

609
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:39,453
Oh my God, really?

610
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:42,151
You took it all, I don't
have anything left.

611
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:43,457
How am I supposed to live?

612
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:44,632
I'm broke now.

613
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:46,155
Oh my God, really?

614
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,461
- Oh Michael.
- Fine.

615
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,680
- Just pay it.

616
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:49,855
- Don't even bother.

617
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:55,295
- So, your baby mama didn't
make you come up here?

618
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,428
- Unbelievable.

619
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,300
- Are you a doctor?

620
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,523
Lawyer?

621
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:08,526
Are you gay?

622
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:12,181
'Cause I ain't ever heard of
this type of stuff before.

623
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,880
- You know what?

624
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:16,185
You really need to back up,

625
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:20,407
'cause you all up in
my personal space.

626
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,061
Can a brother breathe?

627
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:24,629
Just to answer your question,

628
00:42:25,238 --> 00:42:28,328
and to let you know, there's
a first time for everything.

629
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,244
I'm just here to
do the right thing.

630
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:38,338
- Damn, I was just
asking a question.

631
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:39,513
Man, you know what?

632
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:41,210
I'm not about to
sit here and let you

633
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:42,603
make my blood pressure come up.

634
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:43,648
Man, whatever.

635
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,563
Gay ass.

636
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:51,264
- This sister's trippin' man.

637
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:54,223
What the hell is going
on up in here, man?

638
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,922
- Damn it, Michelle.

639
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,053
- She's
your daughter, too.

640
00:42:58,097 --> 00:42:59,228
- You
just took it all.

641
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,578
You had to take everything!

642
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:01,579
I have nothing!

643
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:02,536
Nothing!

644
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:06,105
All my damn money,
1200 bucks a month.

645
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:07,889
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold on.

646
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:08,673
- What do you want?

647
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:10,109
- How much did you say?

648
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:12,154
- 1200 bucks, they're gonna
take all my damn money.

649
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:13,373
- Yeah I'd be mad too,

650
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,766
but you gotta take
that outside, brother.

651
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:17,246
Take it out, take it out.

652
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,204
- You're next bro.

653
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:21,076
Don't let them screw you
out of all your money.

654
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,122
I'm gonna be eatin'
frickin' jelly sandwiches

655
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:24,514
for the rest of my life.

656
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:25,951
God!

657
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:29,563
- I'll be back.

658
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:34,655
- David Lee?

659
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:38,398
- Thank God.

660
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:41,096
What a hot mess.

661
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:44,404
I gotta get the
hell out of here.

662
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:49,583
- Please have a seat.

663
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,193
- Thank you.

664
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:52,325
- You know,

665
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:57,330
I have been here
for eight years,

666
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:01,116
and you are the first
man who has volunteered

667
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,509
with no court order.

668
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,426
Most men have to be pushed
and dragged to come here.

669
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:09,298
You know, you are rare,

670
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:11,866
and I heard you stirred
up my lobby quite a bit.

671
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,130
- In all honesty,
your lobby is a zoo.

672
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,306
Thank you for saving me.

673
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:20,658
- Now look, if I may say this,

674
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,573
this place is like a torture
chamber for the average man.

675
00:44:24,357 --> 00:44:25,967
You can take away his food,

676
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:27,665
he could lose his girlfriend,

677
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,667
break his new sports car.

678
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,234
However, my mother always says,

679
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:35,150
a man's finances is his
most prized possession.

680
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,719
So many cases just go to court,

681
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:40,329
because fathers don't feel

682
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:43,463
they need to be financially
responsible for their children,

683
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:46,118
regardless of the relationship
status with the mother.

684
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,078
So, it is a really
good thing to know,

685
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:51,863
that there's still
good fathers out there.

686
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:54,213
- Ma'am, please allow me to say,

687
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:59,087
I believe money is important
to everyone, not just mothers,

688
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:00,785
but fathers as well.

689
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:04,223
I mean, we have bills,
we have to live too.

690
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:07,835
But jail, that's not
an option for me.

691
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:10,316
Okay, my parents taught me

692
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:13,711
to be responsible
for my daughter.

693
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,103
That's why I'm here.

694
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,323
- You know, I
completely understand.

695
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,368
Let's just start all over.

696
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:21,893
My name is Jessica Bradley.

697
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:23,416
I'm the Senior Child
Support Officer.

698
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:25,505
How may I help you?

699
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:29,074
- Miss Bradley, let
me be honest with you.

700
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:34,253
I have not seen or heard
from my daughter in months.

701
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:38,300
Her mother will not
pick up my phone calls.

702
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,826
I'm desperate, and
I'm out of options.

703
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,785
That's why I'm here
in your office.

704
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,962
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

705
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:51,009
Money doesn't matter to me.

706
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,099
I broke up with my
daughter's mother.

707
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:56,710
I never intended to break
up with my daughter.

708
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:00,932
And I'm hoping when my
daughter becomes an adult,

709
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:03,761
that she will
learn to appreciate

710
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:07,155
how hard I fought to
keep her in my life.

711
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:11,812
After all, she is my priority.

712
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:16,948
So, here is my application,

713
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,430
and here's my identification.

714
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:31,789
- Tameka Williams?

715
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:53,811
- Boy, what do you
think you're doing?

716
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:55,813
You know, you know better.

717
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:56,726
Take it to your room.

718
00:46:57,249 --> 00:46:58,076
- Man.

719
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:23,797
- Hello my dear,
how's my little man?

720
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,146
- He's doing his homework.

721
00:47:26,321 --> 00:47:28,846
- Well, did you go?

722
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,544
- Yes ma'am, I did.

723
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:33,894
I can't stand the
child support office,

724
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:35,200
they are so damn slow.

725
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,680
- Well, I'm
just glad you went.

726
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:40,683
Now you can finally
catch up on your bills.

727
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,295
- Yeah, but I'm not counting
on James to come through.

728
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,602
- Okay, well
you did the right thing,

729
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,866
by filing child
support on his ass.

730
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:54,828
- Mom, you won't believe
what happened in there today.

731
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:58,701
There's a man that walked
into the child support office,

732
00:47:58,745 --> 00:47:59,964
and guess why?

733
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:02,662
- Court's order?

734
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:07,406
- No, he came in there to
file child support on himself.

735
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:08,929
- What?

736
00:48:09,277 --> 00:48:10,931
I can't believe that.

737
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,324
- I was so mean to him.

738
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,240
All I could think about
was Jason and James.

739
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:16,937
I cursed him out bad.

740
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,028
- Tameka, don't hate
every man because of James.

741
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:24,727
This man should be
praised for understanding

742
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:28,688
that mothers need their help
to raise their children.

743
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,168
- I guess you're right.

744
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:32,953
Let me go start dinner.

745
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:35,956
Jason be way to quiet
in his room right now,

746
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,176
and he's gettin' so big.

747
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:39,960
I'll talk to you later.

748
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,041
- Yeah, yeah, walk along lady.

749
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,391
Yeah, listen to your
headphones lady.

750
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:05,306
Yeah, happy day isn't it?

751
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,178
Happy day.

752
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,876
$900 dollars,
that's unbelievable.

753
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:11,008
Let's go.

754
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,096
Come on, let's go.

755
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:14,359
It's a green light
lady, come on.

756
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:16,709
Come on.

757
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:18,189
Where is she?

758
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:22,497
Come on, come on man.

759
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,934
Come on, you're not
supposed to yield right now.

760
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:25,935
Hurry up.

761
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,068
I can't believe this.

762
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:29,548
My AC doesn't even work,

763
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:32,812
but yet she wants
900 dollars from me?

764
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:37,469
Come on, pick up the phone.

765
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,213
Pick up your phone!

766
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:48,523
Yeah come on, she has
to be here somewhere.

767
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:50,221
She has to be here somewhere.

768
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,920
Yeah, enjoy the art show lady.

769
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:55,965
Yeah, probably on
your husband's dime.

770
00:50:56,705 --> 00:50:57,967
That's why she's jealous,

771
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:00,535
she's jealous because
Veronica is independent,

772
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:02,494
and she's not, she
never has been.

773
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,104
How am I?

774
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:05,540
I have to pay to see my son?

775
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:08,543
I have to pay to see my son?

776
00:51:08,587 --> 00:51:10,197
Oh, I wish it were that easy.

777
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,330
I wish I could just
sign on the dotted line

778
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,114
and see my son.

779
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,073
Unbelievable.

780
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:17,726
It's too easy.

781
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,293
Where is she?

782
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:22,905
There she is.

783
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:30,217
Monica!

784
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,219
Monica!

785
00:51:34,526 --> 00:51:35,918
Monica!

786
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:41,359
Monica, I know you
hear me Monica.

787
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:43,926
Monica, I know you
hear me Monica.

788
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,103
Answer your phone Monica.

789
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,104
Monica?

790
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:49,149
Monica?

791
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,326
Monica, I know you
hear me, Monica.

792
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:55,286
God damn it, Monica!

793
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:58,158
Monica, I know you
hear me Monica.

794
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,160
Answer your phone, Monica.

795
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,642
Monica, I see you, Monica.

796
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,992
Monica!

797
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,740
Hey, I know you hear me.

798
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,045
- What?

799
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:16,959
- What the hell is going on?

800
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,352
- What do you want?

801
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:19,745
- I go to my office, my
boss hands me this letter.

802
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:20,746
What did you do?

803
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:21,660
Huh?

804
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:23,531
- I filed child support on you.

805
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:25,533
- Of course you filed
child support on me.

806
00:52:25,577 --> 00:52:26,447
You know what?

807
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:27,535
That's exactly why I left you.

808
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:31,148
- Ricky, I'm not about to
have this argument with you.

809
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:32,540
I walk to work every day,

810
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:34,542
and you never once
offered to give me a ride.

811
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,978
Not once.

812
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:38,198
- You getting to work
is none of my concern.

813
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,069
I don't care how you get there.

814
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:41,375
- Really? Uh huh.

815
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:43,377
And is Travis none
of your concern?

816
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:45,553
'Cause when he gets sick,

817
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:47,207
now I have to take
him to the clinic,

818
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,209
'cause you took him
off your insurance.

819
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,819
It's wrong, and you know it.

820
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:53,082
- You know Brian, Brian was
right what he said about you.

821
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:55,215
Look at you, you're
just a gold digger.

822
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,957
- Oh yeah, okay, a gold digger.

823
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,958
Really?

824
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:01,090
You know what?

825
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:02,483
Veronica's got your
mind so twisted,

826
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,269
you don't even know
up from down anymore.

827
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:08,272
Oh my God, that woman
has three children.

828
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:11,318
Three, and they get the
benefit of your entire salary,

829
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:13,146
while Travis struggles?

830
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,278
I won't have it.

831
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:15,801
- There she goes
about Veronica again.

832
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:18,195
Well her three kids are
none of your concern.

833
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:20,501
But 20% of my damn paycheck.

834
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:22,242
That's almost 900
dollars a month.

835
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:25,027
- And don't forget back child
support for nine months.

836
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,855
- You know I think I
just figured it out.

837
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:29,380
You're jealous, that's what
this whole thing stems from.

838
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:31,338
- Yep, I'm jealous.

839
00:53:33,035 --> 00:53:33,862
You know what?

840
00:53:33,906 --> 00:53:35,560
Miss Veronica can have you.

841
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,780
Sooner or later, she's gonna
figure out who you really are.

842
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,696
- You have no idea what
you're talking about.

843
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,611
- Whatever Ricky, you heard me.

844
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:47,267
I mean I am tired of
you and your lies.

845
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,531
I'm moving on, and I'm
gonna be strong for Travis.

846
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:52,620
So you can go
ahead with Veronica

847
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:55,057
and this new family
of yours or whatever,

848
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,103
but I'm gonna raise
Travis to be a strong man,

849
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:58,931
who's responsible for his kids,

850
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:01,325
unlike his sorry-ass father.

851
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,240
- Hey, god damn it.

852
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:04,589
- Get off of me.

853
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:06,808
- You all see that?

854
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:08,375
You know what, he's my son too.

855
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:09,898
And I'm not paying it.

856
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:11,813
I'm not paying it.

857
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,424
Anybody see that, she hit me.

858
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:12,309
- How's my little man?

859
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:16,182
- I'm just finishing
my math homework.

860
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,404
- Jason,

861
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:25,322
I wanted to apologize about
my attitude this morning.

862
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:28,760
I just want you to have all
the things

863
00:55:28,803 --> 00:55:30,065
that I didn't have as a kid.

864
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:34,156
- Mom, I know dad's not
helping you with money.

865
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,550
That's why we eat
so much oatmeal.

866
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:37,943
But I still love you.

867
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:39,336
And I still love dad.

868
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:42,774
- Okay Jason.

869
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:45,690
Finish up your homework

870
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:46,343
and I'll call you
when dinner's ready.

871
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:48,475
- Okay mom.

872
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:04,839
- Look at this.

873
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:06,450
I have no food in the house.

874
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,327
We have nothing to eat.

875
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:18,375
I can't keep doing this.

876
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,073
I can't keep doing this.

877
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:23,945
I can't keep doing this!

878
00:56:24,424 --> 00:56:25,599
I hate you, James!

879
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:27,427
I hate you!

880
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:32,954
- Mom!

881
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,521
Mom!

882
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:36,393
It'll be okay.

883
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:41,093
Don't cry, don't cry, okay.

884
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,488
It'll be okay.

885
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,318
It's going to be okay.

886
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,250
I never thought

887
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:09,904
I could hate my son's father.

888
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:16,128
I can still hear
Ricky screaming.

889
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:34,668
My God, why is he so angry?

890
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:48,595
- I stink.

891
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:51,293
I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower,

892
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:53,165
then do my homework in my room.

893
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:58,126
- I thought I smelled a
little something in the car.

894
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,040
It's just a little bit worse

895
00:57:59,084 --> 00:58:00,128
than when your dad goes fishing.

896
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:01,956
- Wow, really mom?

897
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:04,481
- I'm just kidding.

898
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,353
You played really hard today.

899
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:09,616
Why don't you go on up?

900
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,313
I'll come up and check
on you in a little bit.

901
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,314
- Okay.

902
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:18,277
- Oh Micheal,

903
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:20,714
look what you're
doing to our daughter.

904
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:23,369
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

905
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:28,766
Let me call mom.

906
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:16,204
- Hey, what's going on John?

907
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:19,338
- David, I
didn't see you today.

908
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,253
Is everything okay?

909
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,951
- I'm okay sir.

910
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,345
I just had some
personal business

911
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:28,347
I needed to attend to today.

912
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,568
- It's not like
you to just disappear.

913
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:33,047
Is your daughter okay?

914
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,962
- My daughter is fine.

915
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,052
I'll tell you what, John.

916
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:41,316
First thing in the morning
I will come to your office,

917
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,840
and we can talk about it.

918
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:45,233
- Sure thing Dave.

919
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:48,454
Okay, have a good evening, sir.

920
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,155
- No mom, I'm outside.

921
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:38,678
She's upstairs
doing her homework.

922
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,114
She can't hear me.

923
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:42,116
- You shouldn't
treat her father like that.

924
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,032
- Mom, why are you
taking up for him?

925
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:47,382
- I'm not
taking up for him.

926
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:51,125
Michelle, why are you trying
to make him to be a bad father?

927
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:52,300
He's not.

928
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,695
I'm so sick of you and Michael.

929
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,439
You need to go upstairs and
tell my granddaughter the truth.

930
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:03,485
Kelly thinks her
father is coming home.

931
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:08,055
Stop procrastinating,
stop blaming Michael,

932
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,840
and go talk to your daughter.

933
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:14,671
Now, I love you, and I'll
talk to you tomorrow.

934
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:16,977
- Okay mom, I love you too.

935
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:18,587
Bye.

936
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,829
- Michael,
of all people, why Karen?

937
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:44,875
- What do
you mean, why Karen?

938
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:45,702
Really?

939
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:47,007
You left me.

940
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:54,101
I can't do this anymore.

941
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:57,365
- Oh great, all
you do is nag nag nag anyway.

942
01:01:57,409 --> 01:01:58,715
Every time you open your mouth.

943
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,325
What the hell is
wrong with you, woman?

944
01:02:00,368 --> 01:02:01,979
- You
need to move out of the house.

945
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,110
- I'm out of here.

946
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,645
Michael, I'm done.

947
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:18,865
I want a divorce.

948
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:22,129
- Good,
that's fine with me.

949
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:23,522
I don't need you.

950
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:27,700
I've been waiting for
that, that's just fine.

951
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,745
You're gonna regret this.

952
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:30,398
I'll talk to my lawyer tomorrow.

953
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:32,487
I'm glad you asked for it first.

954
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:33,706
I'm gonna get everything.

955
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,012
You watch, I'm out of here.

956
01:02:35,055 --> 01:02:36,274
I don't need you.

957
01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:11,178
- Oh
my God, what a long day.

958
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,791
I'm just glad to be home.

959
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,795
You ever had a day

960
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:22,624
that you were so excited about,

961
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:25,366
then at the end of that day,

962
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,065
everything that could go wrong,

963
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:30,937
did go wrong.

964
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:34,680
What happened?

965
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:38,553
Why do I feel so empty inside?

966
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:41,818
Am I really all alone?

967
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:48,825
Oh boy, I really need a drink.

968
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:56,745
You know, I thought by filing
child support on myself

969
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:59,226
was the right thing to do.

970
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:04,101
After all, I'm no longer
with my daughter's mother.

971
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:08,932
I would have never
thought in a million years

972
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:13,197
a father would be
criticized, and laughed at,

973
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:18,028
for being financially
responsible for his child.

974
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:23,294
What really is the message my
parents taught me as a kid?

975
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:28,038
Ladies and gentlemen,
when your relationship

976
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:29,866
with your spouse is over,

977
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:32,825
in order to move on,

978
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:36,481
one must not
procrastinate the end.

979
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:40,398
You cannot move
on with your life,

980
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:44,968
until you've legalized
your separation.

981
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:06,206
- She
took my money, my money.

982
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,164
She took it all.

983
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,426
She took all of it.

984
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:12,560
Damn it!

985
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:18,915
I should have known.

986
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,438
I should have known!

987
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:23,397
God she's been,

988
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,790
She's been planning this.

989
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:27,880
How could I be so stupid?

990
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:30,230
God, she took my money.

991
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:34,191
I don't know,
something's gonna happen.

992
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:36,454
Something's gonna happen.

993
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:40,153
She failed me every time.

994
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:43,678
What comes around, goes around.

995
01:05:43,722 --> 01:05:46,029
I'm gonna get mine, too.

996
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:47,595
I'm gonna get mine.

997
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:48,814
I don't!

998
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,905
You're not gonna get
away with this, ever.

01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:41,040
- Hello sir, welcome to
Sammy's Sports Grill.

1014
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,259
- What?
- How many?

1015
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,218
- How many, you can't
see it's just me?

1016
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,611
Really?

1017
01:06:46,654 --> 01:06:47,655
What do they pay you?

1018
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,701
It's too much.
- Excuse me.

1019
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:52,312
- Who hired
that woman anyway?

1020
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,445
I can't believe she has a job.

1021
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:57,143
Ignorance running rampant.

1022
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:03,280
- Hi sir, what can I get you?

1023
01:07:03,323 --> 01:07:04,803
- Case in point, who are you?

1024
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:06,935
Don't you have a curfew?

1025
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:12,898
- Sir, you don't have
to talk to me like this.

1026
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:17,076
- Whatever, go find your
parents, they're lookin for ya

1027
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,338
Go text on your cell phone.

1028
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:20,036
Go find a toilet to clean.

1029
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,341
- What's your problem, man?

1030
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:23,256
- You, move along little girl.

1031
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,649
- Watchin' the game here.

1032
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:26,694
- Yeah yeah yeah, I heard you.

1033
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:32,439
- God, Mike.

1034
01:07:32,483 --> 01:07:33,092
- What?

1035
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:34,006
- Chill out.

1036
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,573
She is new.

1037
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:38,141
- Okay, I'm working
on it, I had a...

1038
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:39,925
You would not believe
the day I had today.

1039
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:42,710
- Okay, so how's it going?

1040
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:43,755
- How's it going?

1041
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,324
It's going horrible,
that's how it's going.

1042
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,543
The worst frickin'
day of my life.

1043
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:50,327
God.

1044
01:07:50,892 --> 01:07:52,459
You have no idea.

1045
01:07:52,503 --> 01:07:55,158
- Mike, calm down.

1046
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:56,115
Okay?

1047
01:07:58,117 --> 01:07:59,075
What happened?

1048
01:08:00,337 --> 01:08:02,426
- My wife, Michelle,
that's what happened.

1049
01:08:02,469 --> 01:08:03,601
This woman.

1050
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:07,648
She took it to a
whole new level today.

1051
01:08:08,258 --> 01:08:10,042
You know, when I
told her I was sorry,

1052
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,565
I said those words, they
came out of my mouth.

1053
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,959
I'm sorry, but did
she remember that?

1054
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:14,742
No!

1055
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:15,787
Oh no.

1056
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,530
We were separated, okay,

1057
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:21,184
before I even
started seeing Karen.

1058
01:08:21,227 --> 01:08:22,185
It was over.

1059
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,362
It was over, I wouldn't
cheat on my wife.

1060
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,928
I wouldn't cheat on my wife.

1061
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:28,060
I wouldn't do that.

1062
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,411
God!

1063
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:37,156
- Kelly?

1064
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:40,333
- Hey mom.

1065
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:42,857
- Hey baby, oh you're
smelling good now.

1066
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:45,121
- Yeah, I really needed it.

1067
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:47,166
- Do you have a minute?

1068
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,080
- Yeah.

1069
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,131
- So,

1070
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,046
I wanted to talk to you

1071
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:00,658
about what's going on
with me and your dad.

1072
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:03,748
- Yeah, I know.

1073
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:06,490
He hasn't been answering
any of my calls.

1074
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,187
What's going on?

1075
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:13,366
- You know your father's
going through a lot right now,

1076
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,935
but I think he's gonna be okay.

1077
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,243
Let's just give him a
little more time to adjust.

1078
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,202
More time?

1079
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:25,204
Mom, is dad mad at me?

1080
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,163
Is that why he
hasn't been answering

1081
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:30,122
any of my text messages
or calling me back?

1082
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:35,606
- No baby, your father
is not upset with you.

1083
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:36,998
Okay?

1084
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:39,827
Maybe a little bit with me,

1085
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:41,612
especially after today.

1086
01:09:42,395 --> 01:09:45,485
But, you know I'm
starting to just think

1087
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:48,184
that your father's
upset with himself.

1088
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:53,189
- Mom, I don't understand.

1089
01:09:57,105 --> 01:09:59,543
Mom, please don't tell
me you're leaving daddy.

1090
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:02,720
- Kelly please, let me explain.

1091
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:09,161
- Mom, are you and
dad getting a divorce?

1092
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:12,730
- Kelly, please,

1093
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:14,862
try to understand

1094
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:16,647
what I'm gonna
explain to you, okay?

1095
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:22,000
Your father, he loves
you very, very much,

1096
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,438
and he's always been
a good dad to you.

1097
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:31,531
But your father will no
longer be living with us.

1098
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:36,057
- Mom, no please.

1099
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,886
We all make mistakes, that's
what you tell me all the time,

1100
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,714
is to forgive my
friends at school.

1101
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,890
- I know, I know Kelly.

1102
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:47,155
And I know this is gonna
be really hard for you.

1103
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:53,161
But, your father and I
are getting a divorce.

1104
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:57,862
- No, Mom please, whatever
dad did, I know he can fix it.

1105
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:03,955
- Come here.

1106
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:04,999
I'm sorry.

1107
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:16,576
- Mom, please,

1108
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,665
please mom, don't give up.

1109
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:21,494
I know we can fix this together.

1110
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:27,065
- It's gonna be okay.

1111
01:11:27,544 --> 01:11:28,284
Okay?

1112
01:11:28,936 --> 01:11:30,198
We're all gonna be okay.

1113
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,113
Sorry.

1114
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:57,922
My daughter's room.

1115
01:11:59,576 --> 01:12:02,970
I really try to avoid
this part of the house

1116
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:05,103
as much as possible.

1117
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:10,238
However, I cannot
resist the temptation

1118
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:11,631
of coming in here.

1119
01:12:12,763 --> 01:12:15,418
Every time I step
into Mary's room,

1120
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:18,595
time stands still for me.

1121
01:12:19,596 --> 01:12:24,165
One time, I was in here for
two days without eating.

1122
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:32,870
Why is Stephanie
doing this to me?

1123
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:36,352
I even thought about
getting back together.

1124
01:12:37,614 --> 01:12:42,183
Then I realized, Mary
will grow up one day,

1125
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,577
and life is hard enough.

1126
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:51,715
People, never be in a
relationship for your kids.

1127
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:56,894
Love is truly an
unconditional choice.

1128
01:12:57,677 --> 01:12:59,810
The relationship will not work,

1129
01:13:00,288 --> 01:13:03,291
and you're just
avoiding the inevitable.

1130
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:08,296
Here, here it comes,
lets wave at him.

1131
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:09,950
Let's wave at him Mary.

1132
01:13:21,048 --> 01:13:22,006
Look at them.

1133
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:35,411
Okay Mary, come here Mary

1134
01:13:35,846 --> 01:13:36,629
You're asleep.

1135
01:13:36,673 --> 01:13:37,413
Come on baby.

1136
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:40,459
Come on, I know you're
tired, it's late.

1137
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:42,026
Come on, daddy got you.

1138
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:44,115
Come here baby, daddy got you.

1139
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:47,292
Come here, oh my baby
girl is gettin' big.

1140
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,207
Come here, daddy got you.

1141
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,774
Daddy got you.

1142
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:24,808
Whoa, whoa.

1143
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,245
You'd better hold on.

1144
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,901
You'd better hold on.

1145
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:33,120
Cause see, I can do
it with one hand.

1146
01:14:34,165 --> 01:14:35,993
See, I got do it with one hand.

1147
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:45,742
I'm so late.

1148
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:48,919
Is he gone?

1149
01:14:50,094 --> 01:14:51,095
I think so.

1150
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,011
Crazy ass.

1151
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,510
- How am I
supposed to live?

1152
01:15:14,814 --> 01:15:15,989
900 bucks a month.

1153
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:17,425
That's more than my rent.

1154
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:19,123
That is more than my rent,

1155
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:21,168
how am I supposed
to afford a house?

1156
01:15:21,212 --> 01:15:23,127
How am I supposed to
afford a house for Travis?

1157
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,564
This is supposed to be in the
best interest of the child.

1158
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:27,523
How is this in
his best interest?

1159
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:28,959
I can't even save.

1160
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:30,874
I can't even save
for a house payment.

1161
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,919
I can't even save
for a down payment,

1162
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:34,921
and now she wants 900 dollars?

1163
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:19,052
- Oh my God,

1164
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:21,272
that woman has three children.

1165
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:24,275
Three, and they get the
benefit of your entire salary,

1166
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:25,581
while Travis struggles?

1167
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:27,191
I won't have it.

1168
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:55,393
- What's up
baby, need a ride?

1169
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,594
- You know
what, he's my son too.

1170
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,118
I'm not paying it,
I'm not paying it.

1171
01:17:25,162 --> 01:17:26,380
Did anybody see that?

1172
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:27,381
She hit me.

1173
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,715
You're always callin' me.

1174
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:58,499
Always calls me
when she needs me.

1175
01:17:58,543 --> 01:18:00,371
When I need her now.

1176
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:03,330
When I need her now,
she's nowhere to be found.

1177
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:10,990
- Hey, how's it goin'?

1178
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:13,297
How's it goin'?

1179
01:18:14,298 --> 01:18:15,560
- Not so good right now.

1180
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,605
- Rough day at the office?

1181
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,349
- Dude, my life sucks
right now, okay?

1182
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:23,350
It sucks.

1183
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:24,917
Any more questions?

1184
01:18:24,961 --> 01:18:26,658
- Geez, no, it's all fine.

1185
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:27,703
- You sure?

1186
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:28,704
- What's his problem?

1187
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:29,487
- What?

1188
01:18:30,183 --> 01:18:31,228
You say something?

1189
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:32,403
- No, nothin', don't
worry about it.

1190
01:18:32,446 --> 01:18:32,882
It's all good.

1191
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:33,665
- Sure?

1192
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:36,624
- I'll
be right with you.

1193
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:37,495
- Thanks.

1194
01:18:38,148 --> 01:18:39,889
- Watchin' the game here.

1195
01:18:40,193 --> 01:18:41,760
- Yeah, I heard
you the first time.

1196
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:43,675
- Ah, take it
to the laundry mat.

1197
01:18:44,154 --> 01:18:45,416
- I'm gonna hit that guy.

1198
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:52,162
- Hey girl.

1199
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:53,598
- Hey!

1200
01:18:54,599 --> 01:18:55,556
How are you?

1201
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,688
- I'm good, good, how are you?

1202
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,690
- You look great,
come on, sit sit.

1203
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:01,780
- What's wrong with him?

1204
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:03,260
- Don't look over
there girl, he's crazy.

1205
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:05,784
This fool done came up
in here raisin' hell.

1206
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,743
- Wow.

1207
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:09,048
- His wife
done left him.

1208
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:11,442
She took the house,
the kids, and the dog.

1209
01:19:11,485 --> 01:19:13,052
- Your friend's been
waiting for you.

1210
01:19:13,096 --> 01:19:13,923
What can I get you?

1211
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:15,272
- Anything you want.

1212
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:16,142
- Just water, please.

1213
01:19:16,186 --> 01:19:17,796
- Water, okay.
- Me too.

1214
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,537
- Sure, I'll be right back.

1215
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,583
- Oh my gosh.

1216
01:19:22,627 --> 01:19:23,802
- Let's take a picture.

1217
01:19:29,982 --> 01:19:30,896
- Awesome.

1218
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,985
- Oh look, it looks so good.

1219
01:19:33,812 --> 01:19:35,422
Look at us being happy.

1220
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:40,340
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

1221
01:19:45,345 --> 01:19:46,564
- What's going on?

1222
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:47,783
- Girl, nothing much,
this place is a zoo.

1223
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:48,958
- Oh my God.

1224
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:49,915
- Don't look over there girl.

1225
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:51,395
He crazy, I'm telling you.

1226
01:19:53,745 --> 01:19:54,746
- Mike?

1227
01:19:55,268 --> 01:19:56,269
Mike.

1228
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:01,187
You're a good father, she
can't take that away from you.

1229
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:02,754
- I wouldn't doubt it.

1230
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:05,844
- That needs to be
your only focus now.

1231
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:07,933
And I'm sorry to say,

1232
01:20:07,977 --> 01:20:09,630
but I believe your
marriage is over.

1233
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:12,068
So you just need
to snap out of it.

1234
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:13,939
- I know you're right,

1235
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:16,507
and my focus does need
to be my daughter.

1236
01:20:18,204 --> 01:20:20,554
In fact, I blew it today.

1237
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,340
I was supposed to
be at her game,

1238
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:26,082
I told her I would be
there, I didn't show up.

1239
01:20:26,473 --> 01:20:29,215
I'm just so distracted
by all of this,

1240
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:31,783
with the, with that
woman, she's just.

1241
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:33,959
God.

1242
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,092
I owe my daughter an apology.

1243
01:20:36,135 --> 01:20:37,745
I was supposed to be
there and I didn't go.

1244
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,316
Wait a minute.

1245
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:46,276
I can't believe I missed this.

1246
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:49,496
What the?

1247
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:51,368
- What, what's up?

1248
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,674
- My wife, Michelle.

1249
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:57,417
What the hell was she doin'
at the child support office

1250
01:20:57,461 --> 01:20:59,245
before it even opened?

1251
01:21:01,508 --> 01:21:04,337
- Well, it sounds like she had
this planned a long time ago.

1252
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:06,296
- Yeah, yeah it does.

1253
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:09,734
God, I can't believe
I missed that.

1254
01:21:11,736 --> 01:21:14,478
Yeah, she's gonna back-charge
me child support, too.

1255
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:16,088
Do you believe that?

1256
01:21:16,132 --> 01:21:18,917
We agreed that I would leave
the house, we agreed on that.

1257
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:24,705
1280 dollars a month,

1258
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:26,664
for five frickin' years.

1259
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:29,232
No more boat, no more tickets.

1260
01:21:29,841 --> 01:21:30,842
Oh God.

1261
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:33,758
I'm gonna blow a gasket,
I'm just gonna chill out,

1262
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:35,891
and think about how
my life is gonna suck

1263
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:37,849
for the next five
frickin' years.

1264
01:21:40,678 --> 01:21:41,984
- That is a lot of money.

1265
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:44,029
What can I get you?

1266
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:46,902
- How about a bandaid
for my wallet?

1267
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:49,992
And a suppository, I'm
gonna need one of those.

1268
01:21:52,298 --> 01:21:53,821
- Seriously, what can I get you?

1269
01:21:53,865 --> 01:21:58,478
- Just, just give me my usual,
the Parmesan garlic wings,

1270
01:21:58,522 --> 01:22:02,439
and you know what?

1271
01:22:02,482 --> 01:22:03,701
Give me a soda.

1272
01:22:04,441 --> 01:22:05,833
- Soda?

1273
01:22:05,877 --> 01:22:06,878
No beer?

1274
01:22:08,271 --> 01:22:08,924
- No.

1275
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:12,840
No beer, in fact, no more beer.

1276
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:16,583
My focus is gonna be on Kelly.

1277
01:22:16,627 --> 01:22:18,063
I'm gonna stay sober for her.

1278
01:22:19,195 --> 01:22:20,979
There's gonna be
some change comin',

1279
01:22:21,023 --> 01:22:22,372
and it starts tonight.

1280
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:25,941
Calm Mike.

1281
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:28,465
- Calm
Mike, I like that.

1282
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:30,684
Sounds like a new beginning.

1283
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:51,504
- What's up, Taylor?

1284
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:53,071
- Dude, where are you?

1285
01:23:53,115 --> 01:23:55,073
Everybody's here at the bar
tonight, watching the game.

1286
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:56,379
This place is gonna be packed.

1287
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:59,077
- Man, I'm not
feelin' it tonight.

1288
01:24:01,688 --> 01:24:05,040
After talkin' to
you this morning,

1289
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,738
man I had to take care of
some personal business.

1290
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,609
- What, come on man.

1291
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:11,089
We've been waitin' for
Houston to get on the map

1292
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:13,091
for like 10 years now.

1293
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:14,310
What happened?

1294
01:24:14,353 --> 01:24:15,572
You turned off your phone

1295
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:17,313
and everything went
straight to voicemail.

1296
01:24:18,575 --> 01:24:21,012
- What's up with the
thousand questions, man?

1297
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:26,061
I'm good, I'm just gonna stay
home and chill for the night.

1298
01:24:26,104 --> 01:24:28,889
So, I'm not comin'
to the bar, man.

1299
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:30,891
- Dude, you're killin' me.

1300
01:24:31,936 --> 01:24:33,198
What happened?

1301
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:34,504
Did you go to the child
support office today?

1302
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,208
- Yes, I did go to
the child support office.

1303
01:24:43,252 --> 01:24:43,904
You know what, man?

1304
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:44,949
I'm good.

1305
01:24:47,647 --> 01:24:48,648
- Dude, are you sure?

1306
01:24:49,954 --> 01:24:51,086
- Yes I'm sure.

1307
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:54,654
Stacy's here man,
I gotta let you go.

1308
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,528
- All right well, I'll
talk to you later, man.

1309
01:24:58,571 --> 01:24:59,442
Good luck.

1310
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:00,399
- I'll holler at you.

1311
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:05,926
- Hey baby.

1312
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,319
- Hey, what's goin' on?

1313
01:25:07,537 --> 01:25:08,581
- I thought you were gonna watch

1314
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:10,366
the game with Taylor tonight.

1315
01:25:10,757 --> 01:25:15,327
- Yeah, I was, but I just
decided to stay home and chill.

1316
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:18,983
Besides, it's a beautiful night.

1317
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:20,506
- Yes, it is.

1318
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:22,117
- What's goin' on with you?

1319
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,119
- Oh my God, I'm so excited.

1320
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:27,905
So, we got the funding to
build a new youth center,

1321
01:25:27,948 --> 01:25:31,169
and guess who's in charge
of the entire project.

1322
01:25:31,778 --> 01:25:33,215
- Baby tell me it's you.

1323
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:34,129
- Yes.

1324
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:35,869
- Congratulations.

1325
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:37,132
- Thank you, baby.

1326
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,569
But that's enough about me.

1327
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:41,571
How was it today?

1328
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:45,227
- Not very good.

1329
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:50,623
Taylor was here earlier
today, and we were talking.

1330
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:56,977
In my opinion, the
Attorney General's office,

1331
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:58,501
it's a goddamn zoo.

1332
01:26:00,372 --> 01:26:02,200
The more I think about it baby,

1333
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:04,637
I don't think I should
have gone there.

1334
01:26:05,595 --> 01:26:07,684
I really think I made a mistake.

1335
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:10,904
- What are you talking about?

1336
01:26:11,209 --> 01:26:16,171
David, what you did
today, was noble and rare.

1337
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:19,304
This is why I was
so attracted to you.

1338
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:21,045
Remember our first date?

1339
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:22,568
You know I won't
let you forget it.

1340
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:23,874
- Yes.

1341
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,789
- And what you talked
about the entire time?

1342
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:27,921
It was a little something like,

1343
01:26:27,965 --> 01:26:30,185
Mary, Mary,

1344
01:26:30,228 --> 01:26:32,578
oh and some more Mary.

1345
01:26:34,276 --> 01:26:37,844
Come on baby, this is
silly, and it's chilly.

1346
01:26:46,636 --> 01:26:52,163
David, don't beat yourself
to death about this.

1347
01:26:52,642 --> 01:26:54,818
Look, I'm not a mother yet,

1348
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:56,036
but I know that you're

1349
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,214
one of the bravest
men I've ever known.

1350
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:01,041
What woman in her right mind

1351
01:27:01,085 --> 01:27:03,783
would not want you to be
the father of her child?

1352
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:06,221
Stephanie's hurting
because of the breakup,

1353
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:09,224
but she knows that
you love Mary,

1354
01:27:09,267 --> 01:27:12,227
and she knows that
you are a good father.

1355
01:27:16,796 --> 01:27:18,537
- Baby I don't think so.

1356
01:27:19,408 --> 01:27:21,714
I just got my ass
chewed out today

1357
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:24,674
by a bunch of angry
single mothers.

1358
01:27:24,717 --> 01:27:25,979
Why?

1359
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:28,765
Is it because I wear a
goddamn tailored suit?

1360
01:27:29,461 --> 01:27:32,464
Is it because I'm not
thugged out from the hood?

1361
01:27:32,508 --> 01:27:36,076
I had a woman today that
called me a gay ass.

1362
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,208
A gay ass!

1363
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,515
In the child support office.

1364
01:27:39,558 --> 01:27:42,996
Baby, I'm just trying to get
legal rights to see Mary.

1365
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,391
I'm just trying to get
some type of justice.

1366
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:50,265
I'm a goddamn attorney,
I can't even help myself.

1367
01:27:50,308 --> 01:27:52,310
What the hell is goin' on?

1368
01:27:52,354 --> 01:27:57,272
- David, baby, look
I know you're upset,

1369
01:27:57,315 --> 01:27:59,883
and I know you miss Mary.

1370
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:03,321
I miss Mary too, and
I never even met her.

1371
01:28:03,365 --> 01:28:05,889
But you still have to believe

1372
01:28:05,932 --> 01:28:08,674
that what you did
today was right,

1373
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:12,287
and all you want is equal
justice as a father.

1374
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:14,332
Like you said, that
place is a zoo.

1375
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:16,595
It's not made for
real men like you.

1376
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,858
It's made for deadbeat dads

1377
01:28:18,902 --> 01:28:20,686
that look at their
children like some type

1378
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:24,037
of financial responsibility
they want to run away from.

1379
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:25,996
That's not you.

1380
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:30,261
David, you are a good man.

1381
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,568
And you want to know
why that's the truth?

1382
01:28:32,611 --> 01:28:33,569
- Why is that?

1383
01:28:33,612 --> 01:28:35,745
- Because I'm always right.

1384
01:28:35,788 --> 01:28:38,051
- Yes, yes, you're always right.

1385
01:28:38,095 --> 01:28:40,576
- Baby, people
break up every day,

1386
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:45,232
but children still need to
be fed and taken care of.

1387
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:48,323
You know this, and I thank God

1388
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:50,237
that your parents raised you

1389
01:28:50,281 --> 01:28:53,023
to be such a responsible man.

1390
01:28:57,941 --> 01:28:59,464
- Baby, I know you're right.

1391
01:29:00,857 --> 01:29:02,032
It's just that,

1392
01:29:02,075 --> 01:29:04,295
I'm dealing with a pain,

1393
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:06,602
that I cannot describe.

1394
01:29:08,386 --> 01:29:10,693
I spend so much time
in her room now.

1395
01:29:12,129 --> 01:29:15,828
Baby, I'm missing
holidays, birthdays.

1396
01:29:15,872 --> 01:29:16,916
- I know baby.

1397
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,092
- Even school programs.

1398
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:24,184
Still, I thank God for you.

1399
01:29:25,577 --> 01:29:27,710
I don't know what I
would do without you.

1400
01:29:30,234 --> 01:29:33,193
Girl, where you
been all my life?

1401
01:29:33,237 --> 01:29:34,412
- Gettin' ready for you.

1402
01:29:34,456 --> 01:29:35,370
- Is that right?

1403
01:29:35,413 --> 01:29:36,588
- You better believe it.

1404
01:29:37,589 --> 01:29:40,853
Now, I've got one job for you.

1405
01:29:40,897 --> 01:29:41,854
- What's happenin'?

1406
01:29:41,898 --> 01:29:42,812
- Sit down.

1407
01:29:42,855 --> 01:29:44,553
- Hold on baby.
- Uh uh uh uh.

1408
01:29:44,596 --> 01:29:48,339
No, I didn't say ask
questions, I said, sit down.

1409
01:29:49,296 --> 01:29:50,776
I want you to put the game on.

1410
01:29:51,037 --> 01:29:52,082
- I can do that.

1411
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:53,605
- And now, I'm gonna
go make dinner.

1412
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:55,607
- No no no no, baby.

1413
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:56,652
You don't have to do that.

1414
01:29:56,695 --> 01:29:58,828
I was just gonna
order us a pizza.

1415
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:00,612
- No no no no no, baby.

1416
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:03,049
My man is not havin'
pizza tonight.

1417
01:30:03,093 --> 01:30:04,573
- Okay.

1418
01:30:04,616 --> 01:30:07,010
- That's right, I'm
making your favorite.

1419
01:30:07,053 --> 01:30:10,143
- Okay mamacita, you go
on with your bad self.

1420
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:11,449
- You better
believe I will.

1421
01:30:11,493 --> 01:30:12,972
- I'm gonna tell my mom.

1422
01:30:13,016 --> 01:30:15,061
- Oh, and can you also tell her

1423
01:30:15,105 --> 01:30:18,021
that I want the recipe for
her red beans and rice please,

1424
01:30:18,064 --> 01:30:19,979
for the third time.

1425
01:30:20,023 --> 01:30:21,459
- Yes ma'am.

1426
01:30:22,634 --> 01:30:24,157
- Thank you big daddy.

1427
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:06,199
- Excuse me?

1428
01:31:06,243 --> 01:31:09,246
Hi, weren't you at the child
support office this morning?

1429
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:11,770
- Yeah, I was there
tryin' to get some help.

1430
01:31:12,554 --> 01:31:14,512
- Look, it's pretty dark.

1431
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:16,253
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

1432
01:31:17,907 --> 01:31:18,995
- No, thank you.

1433
01:31:19,996 --> 01:31:21,301
- Where are you headed?

1434
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:24,566
- Just two miles that way.

1435
01:31:25,262 --> 01:31:27,830
It's really okay, I walk
this every day I work.

1436
01:31:27,873 --> 01:31:31,398
- Look, I'm just here to help
as many mothers as possible.

1437
01:31:31,442 --> 01:31:35,228
It's my job, and I really
do care about the children.

1438
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:42,932
- Are you sure?

1439
01:31:57,381 --> 01:31:58,295
Thank you.

1440
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:15,007
- So you think Houston's
gonna do it tonight?

1441
01:32:15,051 --> 01:32:16,313
- I hope so man,

1442
01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:18,184
we've been waiting for
this for a long time.

1443
01:32:19,055 --> 01:32:20,056
- Yeah we have.

1444
01:32:26,976 --> 01:32:29,935
I couldn't help but
hear your friend

1445
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:31,371
isn't gonna make it tonight.

1446
01:32:31,415 --> 01:32:34,287
- No, he's got a lot
goin' on, he's busy.

1447
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:38,509
- I'm Mike.

1448
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:40,859
Go ahead and shake it.

1449
01:32:41,599 --> 01:32:44,167
I'm not gonna bite
your head off, again.

1450
01:32:44,646 --> 01:32:46,038
- Taylor, nice to meet you.

1451
01:32:46,082 --> 01:32:47,213
- Nice to meet you, too.

1452
01:32:48,084 --> 01:32:49,346
- Hey, what can I get you?

1453
01:32:49,651 --> 01:32:50,869
- Can I get a draft beer please?

1454
01:32:50,913 --> 01:32:51,696
- You got it.

1455
01:32:53,437 --> 01:32:56,353
- I also owe you an apology.

1456
01:32:57,615 --> 01:32:58,964
I kind of took your
head off earlier,

1457
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,923
and I really didn't
have a right to do that.

1458
01:33:02,446 --> 01:33:04,404
I'm having some struggles
with my wife lately.

1459
01:33:04,448 --> 01:33:06,276
I took it out on
you, and I apologize.

1460
01:33:06,668 --> 01:33:08,757
- Man, it's all good.

1461
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,019
We all go through stuff.

1462
01:33:10,672 --> 01:33:11,629
- Thanks.

1463
01:33:18,027 --> 01:33:19,245
- Well,

1464
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:21,639
here's to Dave.

1465
01:33:22,379 --> 01:33:23,380
Good luck to him.

1466
01:33:26,818 --> 01:33:28,733
And congratulations.

1467
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:57,109
- So, this weather
we're having in Houston

1468
01:33:57,153 --> 01:33:58,633
sure is crazy, right?

1469
01:33:59,285 --> 01:34:02,549
I mean, one day it's hot,
the next day it's cold.

1470
01:34:02,593 --> 01:34:05,074
Oh, and then we get hit
by Hurricane Harvey.

1471
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:07,119
And then it snowed.

1472
01:34:07,163 --> 01:34:10,079
I mean when was the last
time it snowed in Houston?

1473
01:34:17,695 --> 01:34:19,305
I'm Jessica Bradly, by the way.

1474
01:34:19,349 --> 01:34:22,439
I'm Senior Child Support Officer
at our downtown location.

1475
01:34:25,094 --> 01:34:27,749
- Monica, that's my name.

1476
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:36,322
- So Monica, how many
kids do you have?

1477
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:41,545
- Just one.

1478
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:45,767
My son, Travis.

1479
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:48,770
- Ah, he's a
good-lookin' young man.

1480
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,904
So Monica, where do you work?

1481
01:34:53,731 --> 01:34:54,950
- In the Medical Center.

1482
01:34:55,254 --> 01:34:56,603
I'm a nurse assistant,

1483
01:34:57,561 --> 01:34:59,258
currently on the night shift,

1484
01:34:59,302 --> 01:35:00,695
trying to get on the day.

1485
01:35:02,218 --> 01:35:04,481
And the hours are long and
the pay's really crappy.

1486
01:35:04,524 --> 01:35:05,221
- Ugh.

1487
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,095
Hey Monica, do you have

1488
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:12,881
any clerical experience
by any chance?

1489
01:35:14,317 --> 01:35:16,667
- Yeah, I can type
like 90 words a minute.

1490
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,582
- Wow, that's pretty great,

1491
01:35:19,148 --> 01:35:20,453
because we actually do need

1492
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:22,281
a child support
officer in my office.

1493
01:35:22,325 --> 01:35:24,109
You should go online and apply.

1494
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:28,766
- But I don't have
any experience.

1495
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,289
- Don't worry about all that.

1496
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:32,030
We'll help you pay
for the training,

1497
01:35:32,074 --> 01:35:34,163
and we'll help you
get your license too.

1498
01:35:34,685 --> 01:35:36,165
So when's your next day off?

1499
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:39,298
- Thursday.

1500
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:40,996
- All right, tell you what.

1501
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:43,912
Why don't you spin by my
office, say around four?

1502
01:35:43,955 --> 01:35:45,522
We can talk all about it then.

1503
01:35:47,176 --> 01:35:49,134
- Yeah okay, I'll be there.

1504
01:35:49,178 --> 01:35:49,961
- Well great.

1505
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:12,174
- Hello?

1506
01:37:16,265 --> 01:37:17,614
Who is this?

1507
01:37:19,355 --> 01:37:20,356
Hello?

1508
01:37:23,054 --> 01:37:24,490
Is anyone there?

1509
01:37:26,057 --> 01:37:27,319
I can't hear you.

1510
01:37:28,712 --> 01:37:29,713
Hello?

1511
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:35,284
Hello?

1512
01:37:35,893 --> 01:37:38,026
- Hi daddy,
how was your day?

1513
01:37:38,896 --> 01:37:40,245
- Mary!

1514
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:43,031
Stacy, it's Mary.

1515
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:46,686
It's Mary.

1516
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:48,819
Oh my God, it's Mary.

1517
01:37:49,951 --> 01:37:55,260
My baby girl, oh God,
it's my baby girl.

1518
01:37:55,957 --> 01:37:57,262
My baby girl.

1519
01:37:58,742 --> 01:38:00,222
Oh God, it's Mary.

1520
01:38:11,102 --> 01:38:12,103
- Mommy,

1521
01:38:13,931 --> 01:38:15,106
daddy's crying.

1522
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:05,537
- What if
I told you there's a man

1523
01:41:05,581 --> 01:41:07,800
in the Attorney General's
office right now,

1524
01:41:07,844 --> 01:41:11,326
filing child support on
himself, without a court order?

1525
01:41:11,369 --> 01:41:12,631
- That's a first.

1526
01:41:13,632 --> 01:41:14,981
Good for his kids.

1527
01:41:15,504 --> 01:41:17,419
But I'm sorry, I'm
late, I've gotta go.

1528
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:21,162
- Hi there, ma'am.

1529
01:41:21,205 --> 01:41:23,077
Excuse me, you
look pretty happy.

1530
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,295
What happened in there?

1531
01:41:25,296 --> 01:41:27,690
- Well, they finally
found his cheating ass.

1532
01:41:27,733 --> 01:41:31,302
I just got 1280 a month.

1533
01:41:32,129 --> 01:41:34,697
Michael, it's over between us.

1534
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:37,091
I just need you to
take care of Kelly now.

1535
01:41:38,135 --> 01:41:39,049
Bye.

1536
01:41:42,879 --> 01:41:44,272
- Excuse me, sir?
Excuse me.

1537
01:41:44,533 --> 01:41:45,577
- What?

1538
01:41:45,621 --> 01:41:46,709
Are you just coming

1539
01:41:46,752 --> 01:41:47,492
from the Attorney
General's office?

1540
01:41:47,536 --> 01:41:49,407
Because you look really mad.

1541
01:41:49,973 --> 01:41:51,583
- Bro, I'm about
ready to blow up.

1542
01:41:51,627 --> 01:41:55,500
They got me for
1280 bucks, a month!

1543
01:41:55,544 --> 01:41:57,372
No more hunting, no
more season tickets.

1544
01:41:57,415 --> 01:41:59,156
I'm gonna get six
frickin' jobs to eat.

1545
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,505
I'm pissed!

1546
01:42:00,549 --> 01:42:01,941
Get out of my face.

1547
01:42:24,225 --> 01:42:25,835
- What the hell
are you doin' home?

1548
01:42:31,667 --> 01:42:34,017
- You dropping that damn top,
like five times.

1549
01:42:34,713 --> 01:42:36,106
But I'm five percent?

1550
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:47,030
- Excuse me?

1551
01:42:49,206 --> 01:42:50,468
- Yes?

1552
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:52,166
- How you doin'?

1553
01:42:53,384 --> 01:42:54,168
- What's up?

1554
01:42:58,215 --> 01:42:59,216
That's good.

1555
01:43:08,051 --> 01:43:09,574
- Movie magic.

1556
01:43:09,618 --> 01:43:14,579
We got the sound man under
the coffee table.

1557
01:43:14,623 --> 01:43:16,755
That's the only way
we're gonna be able

1558
01:43:16,799 --> 01:43:21,195
to get a perfect
picture without a glare.

1559
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:29,159
Shiny balls, will
never be out of style.

1560
01:43:31,466 --> 01:43:33,946
Summer, Winter, Fall.

1561
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:36,210
- Any season really. Shiny
balls.

1562
01:43:36,253 --> 01:43:37,515
- Go ahead
and it into position.

1563
01:43:37,559 --> 01:43:39,474
- Shiny balls all the time.

1564
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:41,302
- Sorry.

1565
01:43:44,087 --> 01:43:45,480
- Okay, you shall go straight,

1566
01:43:45,523 --> 01:43:47,221
and you shall turn
left at the light.

1567
01:43:48,439 --> 01:43:50,136
- All right, all right captain.

1568
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:02,366
- 800 dollars a month.

1569
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:03,846
800 dollars a month.

1570
01:44:03,889 --> 01:44:05,239
- 900, sir.

1571
01:44:07,719 --> 01:44:09,373
- 900 dollars a month.

1572
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:10,287
I can't even believe this.

1573
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:11,506
900 dollars.

1574
01:44:31,352 --> 01:44:33,049
- She hasn't said action yet.

1575
01:44:33,832 --> 01:44:37,358
You uncomfortable?
He's uncomfortable.

1576
01:44:41,318 --> 01:44:42,276
- Action.

1577
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:56,290
- And you, you're next bro.

1578
01:44:56,681 --> 01:44:58,117
They gonna take all your money!

1579
01:44:58,161 --> 01:44:59,249
All of it!

1580
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:00,729
Don't let 'em screw
you out of it.

1581
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:02,600
I'm gonna be eating
jelly sandwiches

1582
01:45:02,644 --> 01:45:04,298
for the rest of
my frickin' life.

1583
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:05,647
God.

1584
01:45:06,517 --> 01:45:07,431
- He eats jelly sandwiches.

1585
01:45:07,475 --> 01:45:09,128
I eat oodles and noodles.

1586
01:45:09,172 --> 01:45:10,173
Let me go handle this.

1587
01:45:15,396 --> 01:45:16,222
- Cut.
