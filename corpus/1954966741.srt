1
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:02,819
<i>I died on January 18, 1989.</i>

2
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:07,189
<i>I was the father</i>
<i>of three children,</i>

3
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:11,260
<i>the husband</i>
<i>of a wonderful wife.</i>

4
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:14,196
<i>A man with a great future.</i>

5
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:16,599
<i>I was 38 years old.</i>

6
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:43,993
You comin'?

7
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,529
Oh, honey, you know.

8
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,565
It's not gonna
stop me from asking.

9
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:54,736
I would feel so terrible having six new
students start with a substitute teacher.

10
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,675
I still can't convince
my wife to have a...

11
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:02,812
a lovely weekend
with her husband.

12
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,086
We can sleep in,
order room service.

13
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,921
Room service?

14
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:16,625
There probably
isn't room service, but...

15
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:21,363
We could... We could, uh, pick up some
hamburgers and some strawberry milk shakes.

16
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:24,833
Oh. You're getting me.
I'm listening.

17
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:28,504
Get all cozy. Put on
some "Love Me Tender."

18
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:37,612
Ohh.

19
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:39,514
I think we're
in a jailhouse rock now.

20
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:41,115
Ohh. How you doing?

21
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:42,483
Did you sleep well? Uh-huh.

22
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,617
Yeah? Yeah.

23
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,286
I think you're heavier.
Uh, yeah.

24
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:46,954
Did you grow again? Uh, no.

25
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:50,022
Rain check? IOU.

26
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,127
Where's your brother at?
I don't know.

27
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,562
- You don't know?
- No.

28
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,666
I gotcha. Oh! Ohh!

29
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:01,634
Ohh!

30
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,470
Good morning. How you doing?
Good.

31
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:06,306
Yeah? All right, guys,
there's not a lot of time.

32
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:10,644
Nicole, no dogs eating
at the table, please.

33
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,646
- Thank you, darling.
- Guys, there's not a lot of time.

34
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:14,314
Eat your food
real quick, please.

35
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:16,383
Mom, I would love
a cup of coffee.

36
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,090
Now, you know Daddy's gonna be
away for a couple of days, so...

37
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,759
<i>In January of 1989,</i>

38
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,495
<i>I attended a church conference</i>

39
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,197
<i>in the Trinity Pines suburb</i>
<i>of Houston,</i>

40
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,698
<i>where the focus</i>
<i>was on the growth</i>

41
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,001
<i>of the Union Baptist</i>
<i>Church Association.</i>

42
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:38,371
<i>I went because I was seriously
considering starting a new church.</i>

43
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:44,110
We know that God
is calling to us

44
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,880
to tell others about heaven

45
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:48,748
and how to go there.

46
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,820
The Gospel begins right here,
right where we are.

47
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:58,657
And it travels.

48
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:03,195
It travels
to every neighborhood,

49
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:05,797
every continent.

50
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,765
And the prize...

51
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:10,535
Mm.

52
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:13,771
The prize
that we shall receive...

53
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,810
is heaven.

54
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:25,315
Amen?

55
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,418
Amen.

56
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,153
Amen.

57
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:32,790
<i>Little did I know that some of
the people listening that day</i>

58
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,059
<i>would be there</i>
<i>to help me later on.</i>

59
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:39,897
You know you did something baptist
preachers almost never do.

60
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,419
Oh, yeah? What's that?
You finished early.

61
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:46,669
Well, good morning, J.V.

62
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:50,238
It seems like I have to
walk to talk to you.

63
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,274
If you walk the walk.

64
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:57,512
I have to keep the ticker on
track since my heart attack.

65
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,013
How's that going, by the way?

66
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:01,482
A whole lot better, thank you.
Oh, good.

67
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:06,154
Rumor has it that you're thinking
about starting a new church?

68
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:10,158
Well, you've started so
many successful churches.

69
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,927
It's a roller-coaster ride,
beginning a new church.

70
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:15,964
Three steps forward,
two steps back.

71
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:18,199
It's challenging.

72
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,934
Worthwhile, but challenging.

73
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:22,437
I believe it's time for me
to start a new congregation.

74
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,773
I would urge you to be certain

75
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,710
that this is what God
really wants you to do

76
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:31,044
and that your family's
on board with the idea.

77
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,449
Sometimes what inspires you

78
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,351
isn't what you end up doing.

79
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,720
It's about finding
your purpose.

80
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,658
Thank you. That's it.

81
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,827
That's what it's all about...
finding your purpose.

82
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,962
And remember,
it's not about you.

83
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:52,298
I appreciate that.

84
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,033
Thank you, J.V.

85
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,754
It's 10:00.

86
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,756
On the dime.

87
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,594
- How are you, darlin'?
- Grading papers.

88
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,096
How's it going? <i> Good, good.</i>

89
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,166
<i>No matter where you</i>
<i>are in the world,</i>

90
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,608
you always manage to call
me at 10:00 every evening.

91
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,938
Is it tradition or love?

92
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,742
<i>Love of tradition.</i>

93
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,910
Very nice.

94
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:48,084
So, I, uh... I had a good chat with J.V.
Thomas about opening a new church.

95
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,687
He was very encouraging.

96
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:54,090
I'd say there's a great chance I can
actually start something this year.

97
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:58,027
Oh, that's exciting. We're
behind you a hundred percent.

98
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:03,099
I think I'm gonna have
to wrestle the twins to bed.

99
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:06,936
I don't know. That might be the
sound of Nicole growing up.

100
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:10,840
<i>Oh, my, she'll be</i>
<i>a teenager soon enough.</i>

101
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,542
Well, she<i> is</i>
ordering coffee now.

102
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:17,046
That's right.

103
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:21,618
Well, my love,
it's bedtime for all of us.

104
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,087
<i>All right, darlin'.</i>

105
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,924
Have a good night.
And I miss you.

106
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,625
And I'll look forward
to seeing you tomorrow.

107
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,126
<i>I love you.</i> I love you.

108
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,796
Night-night. <i> Good night.</i>

109
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,334
<i>I remember</i>
<i>that only three weeks earlier,</i>

110
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,470
<i>I'd received a traffic ticket</i>
<i>for not wearing a seat belt.</i>

111
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,774
<i>Until I received that ticket, I'd
not usually worn my seat belt.</i>

112
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,643
<i>But after that,</i>
<i>well, I changed my ways.</i>

113
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,080
<i>That small act would be</i>
<i>a crucial decision.</i>

114
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,261
I believe in a great God.

115
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,832
I believe in Jesus,
the son of God.

116
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,835
I believe in the Holy Spirit.

117
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:22,338
I believe in baptism.

118
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
I believe in communion.

119
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,242
I believe in a great God.

120
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:25,607
He's dead.

121
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:02,179
- Don, hi.
- Oh, Donnie, you're so beautiful.

122
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:05,682
Can you hear me?

123
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:09,286
<i>State law decreed that a coroner</i>
<i>had to pronounce me dead</i>

124
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:12,188
<i>before my body could be removed</i>
<i>from the wreck.</i>

125
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,692
<i>There was no need for speed</i>
<i>because... I was dead.</i>

126
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:18,560
I got no pulse.

127
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:25,633
We got no pulse at all.

128
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:27,235
All right?

129
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:30,358
- Does anyone wanna call this thing?
- Yeah. I got it.

130
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,142
We need to clean this mess up
so we can get this bridge open.

131
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:37,145
Yeah, I got 12:15 now.

132
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:11,448
According to the report, the
collision occurred at 11:45 AM.

133
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:14,149
Well, it's 1:00 PM.

134
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:24,360
Hey. What's going on up there?

135
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:28,731
Uh, a truck crashed into a car
and another car over there.

136
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,332
Multiple cars got hit.

137
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:39,141
Officer.

138
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:41,409
Dick Onerecker. I'm a minister.

139
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:44,246
Is there anybody here
I can pray for?

140
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:46,481
Yeah. The people in those
two cars over there.

141
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:48,282
They're, uh... They're
shaken, but they're fine.

142
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:50,566
You can talk to 'em
if you'd like.

143
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,388
What about the, uh,
car up there?

144
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,056
The one with the tarp over it?

145
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:58,592
The man in the red Ford
is deceased.

146
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:00,093
I'd like to pray for him.

147
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:02,528
Well, like I said, he's dead.

148
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:09,001
I-I know it sounds crazy,
but, uh,

149
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,203
I have to pray for him.

150
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,139
If that's what you
wanna do, go ahead.

151
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,275
But I gotta tell you
it's an awful sight.

152
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:18,644
He's dead, and it's a real
mess under that tarp.

153
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:22,081
There's blood and glass everywhere,
and the body's all mangled.

154
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,916
I gotta warn you,
you do what you want,

155
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,319
but you've never
seen anybody this bad.

156
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,489
Try being a medic in Vietnam.

157
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,376
I only know God
told me to pray for you.

158
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,513
He died instantly. There's no pulse.
God, I pray...

159
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,215
Yeah, that's what they
said when I got here.

160
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,383
That his sins are forgiven...

161
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,852
We did everything we could, but
the impact probably killed him.

162
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,621
And that he's with you, God.

163
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,523
We need to get the jaws of life ready
for when the coroner gets here.

164
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,192
Okay!

165
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,194
I pray, God,

166
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:15,532
that he knew you.

167
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,638
His father

168
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,206
and his friend.

169
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:08,013
Oh, praise God!

170
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,682
He's... He's singing!

171
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:11,350
He's... He's alive!

172
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:12,751
He...

173
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:16,288
He's alive! He's... He's alive!

174
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,223
The man... The dead man
is singing in there!

175
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:20,192
Oh, really? He's alive!
He was singing with me!

176
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:22,294
You just set a world record
for exiting a wrecked car.

177
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:23,962
Listen to me. He's alive.
The dead man...

178
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,932
Sir, I know a dead guy when I see him.
That man is dead.

179
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,233
Listen. He's alive.
He was singing.

180
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:31,369
We-We-We know our business, okay?
He-He's dead.

181
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,905
No! Listen, look, look, look,

182
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:35,439
I'm gonna lay down
on this bridge.

183
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:38,376
You're gonna have to run over me
if you don't go check on him.

184
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,544
Just do me a favor. Just
check on his pulse, please.

185
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:43,046
Just... Just check
his pulse, that's all.

186
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:44,982
I'll check on him. Come on.

187
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,550
Praise God!

188
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:04,803
- We got a pulse!
- Yes!

189
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,639
Come on! Let's go!

190
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,183
On three, fellas.

191
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,351
One, two, three.

192
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:17,917
We learned a lot
about seals today, didn't we?

193
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,151
Yes. Yes.

194
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:21,320
So I would like for you

195
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:25,156
to please draw
your favorite underwater animal.

196
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,192
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

197
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:28,893
Yes?

198
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,961
I can't. I'm teaching a class.

199
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,638
Well, come anyway.
It's important.

200
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,236
That's good, Annie.

201
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,072
Mrs. Nell needs you
in the office right away.

202
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,607
I'll watch your class for you.

203
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:47,809
Okay. Thank you.

204
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,847
Hi, kids.

205
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:54,382
We're gonna get you
to the hospital soon.

206
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,752
Can you tell me your name?

207
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:59,821
Now, you just stay with me.
Try to stay awake, okay?

208
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,536
Please, sit down.

209
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,808
Don's been in a wreck.

210
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:22,878
What?

211
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,479
A wreck?

212
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,983
What do we got here?

213
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:32,019
Easy.

214
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:37,958
Airway looks clear.

215
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,994
We need to get two large 4-IVs in.
Check in the airway.

216
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:50,269
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

217
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:53,271
Have you heard anything?
No, nothing.

218
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:55,907
Thank you.

219
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,677
Let's cut that right sleeve.
Both IVs in there.

220
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,347
And the BP cuff's
gotta go on there too.

221
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,982
Oxygen, PQ.

222
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,386
Mr. Piper.

223
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:14,959
Mr. Piper. We're gonna do all
we can to save you, Mr. Piper.

224
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:19,129
Don has been taken to the Huntsville
Memorial Hospital just off the 1-45.

225
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,965
<i>He's conscious.</i>

226
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,133
<i>She should probably speak to him now.
It doesn't look good.</i>

227
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,502
- Would you like to speak to Don?
- Yes, I would.

228
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:30,140
<i>We don't let people speak to patients
unless it's a grave situation.</i>

229
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,741
All right.

230
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,280
- Hello?
- He's unable to hold the phone himself,

231
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:40,017
<i>so I'm gonna put it</i>
<i>up to his ear.</i>

232
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:45,221
<i>Don?</i>

233
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:46,889
How are you?

234
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,960
I'm so sorry
that this happened.

235
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,529
It's not your fault.

236
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:57,867
I just wanted
to come home, Eva.

237
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:01,403
Please let me come home.

238
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:11,146
Please let me go home.

239
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:13,983
All right. Thank you very much.

240
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:20,523
They're doing an assessment.

241
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:23,692
Uh, what do you mean...
Uh, what is "assessment"?

242
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,495
They need to assess his injuries
and try to stabilize him.

243
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:29,130
There's a chance
that Don may move hospitals.

244
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,834
I'll take
the twins home with me,

245
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:35,569
so you don't need to worry
about the boys. Thank you.

246
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,506
Hey, I'm driving you
to the hospital.

247
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,674
No, no, that's...

248
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:43,209
You don't have to.
I will drive you.

249
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:45,011
Thank you. Yeah.

250
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:48,514
He's deteriorating rapidly. I don't
think he's gonna survive the afternoon.

251
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:50,783
Put him in an ambulance
and take him to Houston.

252
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:52,785
This facility isn't equipped.

253
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:54,720
Don't you think we should
helicopter him to Hermann?

254
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,083
No. Nobody's flying
in this weather.

255
00:23:57,757 --> 00:24:01,259
<i>As my condition was</i>
<i>deteriorating rapidly,</i>

256
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,061
<i>it was decided</i>
<i>to move me by ambulance</i>

257
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:06,697
<i>for the 80-mile trip back</i>
<i>to Houston's Hermann Hospital</i>

258
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:09,100
<i>which had</i>
<i>a much better trauma center.</i>

259
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:13,103
<i>Still, I kept wondering</i>
<i>why God had brought me back.</i>

260
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,706
Ah, hey,
you gotta do something.

261
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,541
You gotta...

262
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:20,911
Medicine, plea... You gotta
give me some medicine.

263
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:24,214
- I've given you all I can.
- No, you gotta give me more.

264
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:46,004
Ma'am, my name is Eva Piper.

265
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,072
Has my husband,
Donald Piper, arrived?

266
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:50,275
- He's in transit and should be here any moment.
- He's not here yet?

267
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:53,237
No. He'll be coming in from
over there when he does.

268
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,982
Don? Don? I'm here. They're
gonna take good care of you.

269
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:00,917
Listen to me.

270
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,420
It wasn't your fault.
You're gonna make it.

271
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,462
Ma'am, we've gotta go.
You're gonna make it.

272
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:11,293
We need you to fill out
these insurance forms.

273
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:13,495
Thank you.

274
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:25,441
I know, uh,
Don's date of birth.

275
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:28,044
I don't know his
social security number

276
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:29,979
or his insurance company.

277
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:34,150
I don't know the amount
of the deductible.

278
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:37,653
Don's always taken care of this. I don't
have the answers... It's okay. It's okay.

279
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:40,496
These are the easy
questions for now.

280
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:44,794
All I know is that Don is supposed
to lead evening services.

281
00:25:44,796 --> 00:25:46,862
He's meant to preach tonight.

282
00:25:46,864 --> 00:25:49,025
They already have that covered.

283
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,901
I don't know any of this.

284
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:55,136
Ma'am, I filled out
what I could,

285
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,905
but I don't... I don't have
his information.

286
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:58,706
I'll get it to you tomorrow.
That's okay.

287
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:01,208
We deal with this situation every day.
Thank you.

288
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,920
Oh. <i>It was heartwarming</i>

289
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:16,357
<i>to know Eva had the support of our
friends and fellow church members</i>

290
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,892
<i>in her hour of need.</i>

291
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:28,837
<i>Surgeon Kelly,</i>
<i>please report to Room 25.</i>

292
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,272
It's been over an hour.

293
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:34,755
I can't stand the
tension of not knowing.

294
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:38,212
I'm gonna find out what's happening.
Eva, Eva.

295
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:39,780
I need answers.

296
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:45,518
Doctor? May I help you?

297
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,854
I'm trying to find out what's going
on with my husband, Donald Piper.

298
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:50,356
No one's been out
to see you yet?

299
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,625
No, no one. I've heard nothing.
I'm so sorry.

300
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:57,363
I'm Tom Greider, the
orthopedic surgeon on this.

301
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:01,767
Um, come on and I'll show
you what's going on.

302
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:04,436
Your husband is
very badly injured.

303
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:07,939
We<i> are</i> doing everything
we can to save him.

304
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:09,607
See this?

305
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:12,810
It's not just broken.
It's shattered.

306
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,547
He's missing significant
amounts of bone structure,

307
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,782
muscle and skin.

308
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:21,485
That's his right knee.

309
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:26,991
And this is where the left thigh
bone, or femur, should be.

310
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,327
Should be?

311
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:34,231
Well, he's missing a
significant amount of bone.

312
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,932
Four and a half inches.

313
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:39,603
Also, it seems that he
has a cracked pelvis.

314
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:43,473
But, uh, we're just gonna let
that go for the time being,

315
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:47,010
'cause we have to deal with these
other injuries right away.

316
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:49,245
As you can see,

317
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:52,582
only this soft tissue at
the bottom part of his leg

318
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:56,319
is connecting his whole lower
left leg to the rest of his body.

319
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,089
Would you like to see him?

320
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,192
Yes, I would.

321
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:03,826
Well, come on.

322
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,099
He won't respond to you.
He's heavily medicated.

323
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:16,705
We couldn't give him anything until
we'd finished our examination.

324
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:22,377
They're coming to take him
to surgery now.

325
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,749
God.

326
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,185
God help me.

327
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,024
Please help us.

328
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:42,295
I'm so scared.

329
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:49,970
You've always helped us.

330
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:52,872
Now, please...

331
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,373
please help us.

332
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,116
Please help us.

333
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:36,352
For I know the plans
they have for you.

334
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,894
<i>Plans to prosper you.</i>

335
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,364
<i>And to not harm you.</i>

336
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:56,772
<i>To give you hope and a future.</i>

337
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:59,708
<i>Survival was going</i>
<i>to be difficult</i>

338
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,579
<i>because heaven was so glorious.</i>

339
00:31:09,153 --> 00:31:10,552
Hi, Dad.

340
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:14,856
Okay.

341
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,561
Not good.

342
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,537
I don't know.

343
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,239
I don't know, Dad.

344
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:34,376
I'll see you tomorrow
with the kids.

345
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:40,982
<i>I just spoke to Don's parents.</i>

346
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:44,386
<i>They aren't getting here</i>
<i>until the day after tomorrow.</i>

347
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:47,489
<i>I love you too. Bye.</i>

348
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:55,397
The reason you haven't heard from us
is 'cause we worked on him all night.

349
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:58,601
- All night?
- Eleven and a half hours.

350
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:01,103
The good news is there's
no sign of brain damage

351
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:03,372
or internal injury.

352
00:32:03,374 --> 00:32:06,908
We stabilized his left arm and
put his left leg in traction.

353
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,945
We're taking good care
of your husband, Eva.

354
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:12,414
He's gonna be okay.

355
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,317
Thank you, Doctor.

356
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,888
There are a lot of people
in the hospital chapel

357
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,156
praying for Don right now.

358
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,329
How you doing? Okay.

359
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:35,536
I don't want you
to think about this now, but

360
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:38,372
you should consider
hiring an attorney.

361
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:47,046
<i>Enduring all</i>
<i>that I had to go through,</i>

362
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,449
<i>nobody put up</i>
<i>with more than Eva.</i>

363
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:52,285
<i>She would rise</i>
<i>every morning at 6:00,</i>

364
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:54,053
<i>rush to work at the school</i>

365
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,889
<i>and afterwards</i>
<i>hurry back to my bedside,</i>

366
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,791
<i>where she stayed with me</i>
<i>every night.</i>

367
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:02,161
<i>It was the same stressful
routine day after day for her.</i>

368
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:05,497
You're seriously injured.

369
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:09,068
We've done an MRI on you,

370
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,670
and it seems you've
escaped brain damage.

371
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:18,376
I hurt more than I believe
is humanly possible.

372
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,645
We can help you manage that.

373
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:25,483
I just want relief.

374
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:28,785
I understand.

375
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,553
Your family's here to see you.

376
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:34,257
<i>The hardest thing to endure</i>

377
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,959
<i>was having my family,</i>
<i>especially my children,</i>

378
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:39,662
<i>seeing me</i>
<i>in this physical state.</i>

379
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:42,197
Don?

380
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,667
It's okay, boys.
Say hi to your dad.

381
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:47,268
Nicole.

382
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,548
I love you, Daddy.

383
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:03,918
I love you, Dad. Love you.

384
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,790
I love you, Chris,

385
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:11,258
so much.

386
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:17,898
I have a Valentine's
Day dance coming up.

387
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,967
I'm very excited.

388
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,035
Although I don't know
if I have a Valentine.

389
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:28,207
Daddy will dance with you.

390
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,909
Two goals, Dad.
That's what I got.

391
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:33,178
One bounced off the pole.

392
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,680
Excuse me. It's, uh... It's
time for some cleaning.

393
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:36,914
Okay.

394
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,983
I'll see you guys soon.

395
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:41,485
Okay, bye. All right.

396
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:43,153
Come on, guys.

397
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:45,823
Go be with your grandparents
for a minute, okay?

398
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:47,324
Be good boys.

399
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:49,460
See you guys soon.

400
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:56,132
We have the best kids
in the world.

401
00:34:58,034 --> 00:35:00,035
Yeah.

402
00:35:00,037 --> 00:35:01,771
We sure do.

403
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:09,078
Hi. How y'all doing?

404
00:35:09,946 --> 00:35:12,079
You okay? Joe?

405
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,182
Okay.

406
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:17,345
Eva, I think the kids
should come home with us.

407
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,854
We'll find a school
for 'em close by,

408
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:24,457
and that way you won't have to worry about
if they're being taken care of or not.

409
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:28,261
Yeah, and-and that way you can
focus fully on taking care of Don.

410
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,366
Let me talk to Don first.

411
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:35,868
I'm not sure if that's a
decision he can make right now.

412
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,204
Dad. You live 250 miles away.

413
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:40,439
We won't be able to see
them every day. I know.

414
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:44,310
I know it's gonna be tough.
But Don needs you now.

415
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:49,113
And we can bring the kids
back anytime you want.

416
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,950
It's best if I speak with Don.

417
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:55,453
All right. Okay.

418
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,659
Hi.

419
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,696
How you doing today?

420
00:36:09,932 --> 00:36:12,333
Hmm? How you feeling?

421
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:20,241
My dad thinks
it would be better for them

422
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,409
to take the kids
back to Louisiana,

423
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:25,478
at least until we can get
you out of the hospital.

424
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:31,584
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

425
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:34,486
I know.

426
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:37,422
But it'll be better for them.

427
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:39,490
Because that way I don't
have to keep finding people

428
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:42,359
to take them to school
and pick them up every day.

429
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:45,930
It's not a good idea, Eva.

430
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:49,534
It's going to be
impossible for me

431
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,104
to return to teaching school
and maintain health insurance,

432
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:58,108
spend time with you and find the
energy to take care of our children.

433
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,610
No.

434
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:05,181
Don.

435
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,485
Letting my parents
take the kids

436
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:12,754
is the only sensible
solution we have here.

437
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,360
I want you to agree.

438
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:24,897
I will find peace if we
both agree to let them go.

439
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,545
I'm sending them home
with my parents.

440
00:38:28,303 --> 00:38:30,937
<i>Welcome to McDonald's.</i>
<i>Can I take your order?</i>

441
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,208
Hi. Yes. We will have
two cheeseburgers,

442
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,545
two shakes
and two fries, please.

443
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:42,107
<i>Thank you. Please pull
up to the window.</i>

444
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:20,793
<i>Until it was time</i>
<i>for me to come home,</i>

445
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:23,028
<i>Eva would never</i>
<i>sleep in our bed.</i>

446
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:27,166
<i>And that couch</i>
<i>was not comfortable.</i>

447
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,434
<i>I know, 'cause I've been there.</i>

448
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,477
Yes. Hello.
My name is Eva Piper.

449
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,812
I'm looking
to hire an attorney.

450
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:22,824
Mrs. Pepper? Piper.

451
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:25,494
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Cecil Beaumont.

452
00:40:25,496 --> 00:40:27,963
Pleasure. I am your Beau.

453
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:32,768
Before we start,
can I ask you a question?

454
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,336
Yes.

455
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:36,604
How did you hear about me?

456
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:39,541
Billboard. There was a
sign by a drive-through.

457
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:41,976
See there? A sign.

458
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:49,084
Something we all need in a time
of uncertainty, don't you think?

459
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:56,191
Your husband was hit by a
state truck from the prison,

460
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:58,193
is that right? Yes.

461
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:00,028
Cherry.

462
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:02,930
Driven by an inmate?

463
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:06,866
Cherry.

464
00:41:06,868 --> 00:41:11,905
Now, it's not illegal for them
to let an inmate drive a truck.

465
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:15,576
But it shows poor judgment on the
part of those officials at the prison

466
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:19,614
to let an untested,
inexperienced driver

467
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,883
take control of an
18-wheel tractor-trailer.

468
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:27,654
Triple cherry!
Ka-ching! Jackpot!

469
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,092
Several of my friends
are concerned

470
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:35,928
that there might be
some kind of a cover-up

471
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,131
or that the State of Texas will
try and deny who drove the truck.

472
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:44,002
Well, your friends,
are they attorneys?

473
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:46,637
No. Okay.

474
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,774
Their legal advice is worth
what you paid for it, okay?

475
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:53,810
There might be an attempt to alter the
circumstances surrounding the accident.

476
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:56,413
I mean, that's more likely
what they'll do.

477
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:58,314
Uh...

478
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:02,419
You know, they're on the hook
for a pretty big claim here.

479
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:07,724
So I think we can assume pretty stout
pushback from the State of Texas.

480
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,427
Do we have a case?

481
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,563
Excuse me.

482
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,201
918's Tulsa, isn't it?

483
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,703
I'm sorry. Wha... You, uh...

484
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:25,006
Did you just ask,
do we have a case?

485
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:27,975
Ma'am, I wouldn't be here
if there wasn't a case.

486
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:30,610
I am your Beau.

487
00:42:30,612 --> 00:42:35,848
And "mont," as in you have
a "mont-umental" case.

488
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:40,887
That's not that good, is it?

489
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:45,958
"Mon," as in
you have a "monster" case.

490
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:54,533
How about "mont," as in, you have
a case the size of "Montana"?

491
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:58,203
These medical bills
are gonna be astronomical,

492
00:42:58,205 --> 00:43:00,906
and you probably don't have the
resources to cover that, do you?

493
00:43:00,908 --> 00:43:02,707
No, we don't.

494
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,544
How are the children doing?

495
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:12,017
<i>Who wants to say grace tonight?</i>

496
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:14,487
Nicole said it
last night. Boys?

497
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:16,322
Um...

498
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:18,790
Joe? Chris?

499
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,161
Chris, you go ahead.
You're older.

500
00:43:23,163 --> 00:43:25,264
Like 10 minutes older.

501
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:28,000
Well, then you have
a head start, right?

502
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:31,537
Thank you, Father,
for the food on our table,

503
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:35,541
and please
look over our dad, and...

504
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:41,180
and for allowing me and my brother
to skip our homework tonight.

505
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:43,516
Well, this father's not
gonna allow that to happen.

506
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:47,019
Oh, yes, you are.

507
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,057
Can I help you?

508
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:25,794
You sounded like
you were in great pain.

509
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:29,063
What are you talking about?

510
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:30,697
You cried out.

511
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:36,970
God.

512
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:39,672
Is this what you
brought me back for?

513
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:42,674
Yes, dear, you came back to me.

514
00:44:44,144 --> 00:44:46,145
All right, breathe.

515
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:48,380
Deep. Deep breath.

516
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:52,184
Deeper.

517
00:44:52,186 --> 00:44:53,652
Huh.

518
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:55,321
Another.

519
00:44:57,091 --> 00:44:58,857
All right.

520
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,093
Let's get you ready.

521
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:04,595
- For what?
- Taking a breath.

522
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:12,836
You need to leave
this on, all right?

523
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,005
That's good.

524
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:29,715
Oh, God.

525
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:34,020
Please, God.

526
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:42,963
<i>I'm Dr. Houchins.</i>

527
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:46,466
You stop breathing on my watch,

528
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:48,433
I won't be undefeated.

529
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:55,207
All right, let's get you
into a position to win.

530
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:00,512
All right, take a deep breath.

531
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:02,848
Don't give up now. Keep trying.

532
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,550
Did you hear what I said? Do it, now.
Breathe. Do it.

533
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:07,519
Cough. Breathe and cough.
Do it.

534
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:10,154
Do it. Breathe.

535
00:46:10,156 --> 00:46:13,525
This is not a negotiation.
Do this right now. Breathe.

536
00:46:13,527 --> 00:46:16,928
I can't.

537
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,834
All right. Don't do it.

538
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:25,604
If you don't start
breathing and soon,

539
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:28,506
I'm gonna have to resort
to a ventilator.

540
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:30,675
You won't like that.

541
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:34,111
<i>What Dr. Houchins might have
lacked in bedside manners,</i>

542
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:37,448
<i>he made up for</i>
<i>in sheer bulldog determination.</i>

543
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,417
<i>He simply wanted me to breathe.</i>

544
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:42,352
<i>And I had stopped trying.</i>

545
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:56,801
Don?

546
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,470
You gotta breathe.

547
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:05,275
Please, can you breathe?

548
00:47:05,277 --> 00:47:07,211
For me?

549
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,714
You're not even trying.

550
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:15,784
Breathe!

551
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:19,354
Breathe.

552
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,968
Billie.

553
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:36,371
Sarge.

554
00:47:44,514 --> 00:47:46,982
He's this way.
How are you doing?

555
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,318
Well enough.

556
00:47:53,856 --> 00:47:56,491
Oh. Don's just through here.

557
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:59,494
He's stable. I'm sure
he'd love to see you.

558
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:01,864
I can't. I-I... I just can't.

559
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:04,132
No. Okay, that's okay.

560
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:06,702
It's all right. Here, come with me.
Come here.

561
00:48:06,704 --> 00:48:09,838
<i>I knew my mother would have</i>
<i>the most difficult time</i>

562
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,140
<i>seeing me in this condition,</i>

563
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:16,278
<i>and never entered my room during
the entire stay in the hospital.</i>

564
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,115
<i>No mother would wanna</i>
<i>see her son like that.</i>

565
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:20,983
I've got to make
this phone call, okay?

566
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:22,684
Okay. I'll be right back.

567
00:48:22,686 --> 00:48:24,352
<i>David, I don't know what to do.</i>

568
00:48:24,354 --> 00:48:26,623
<i>His mom can't even be in
the same room with him.</i>

569
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:27,456
<i>She's devastated.</i>

570
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,858
<i>He's not gonna make it</i>
<i>unless something happens.</i>

571
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,995
<i>You and Cliff</i>
<i>are Don's best friends.</i>

572
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:35,497
<i>He won't breathe.</i>

573
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,233
<i>He refuses to breathe.</i>

574
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:41,904
You're the only other person in the
world who will make him listen.

575
00:48:41,906 --> 00:48:44,674
<i>All right, I'll be there</i>
<i>as quick as I can.</i>

576
00:48:44,676 --> 00:48:46,796
<i>Probably around three hours.</i>

577
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,311
Thank you.

578
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:03,392
<i>World War II,</i>
<i>Korea and Vietnam.</i>

579
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:05,260
<i>That was my father.</i>

580
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:24,582
Son.

581
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:28,918
I'd give anything

582
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:32,354
to trade places with you.

583
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:02,888
David.

584
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,556
Thank you for coming.

585
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:08,160
He's this way.

586
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:11,563
<i>David Gentiles</i>
<i>was my best friend.</i>

587
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:13,799
<i>Like myself, he was</i>
<i>an ordained minister</i>

588
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:17,636
<i>who was by far the most loving
human being I'd ever known.</i>

589
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:49,139
You're gonna make it.

590
00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:52,508
You have to make it.
You've made it this far.

591
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,209
Uh...

592
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:58,781
I don't know
that I wanna make it.

593
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:00,282
You have to.

594
00:51:00,284 --> 00:51:03,619
Not for yourself,
then hold on for us, Don.

595
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:09,189
I'm tired.

596
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:15,628
I fought all I can

597
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,331
and I'm ready to die.

598
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,533
Well, then you won't have
to do a thing.

599
00:51:21,535 --> 00:51:23,601
We'll do it for you.

600
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,372
We won't let you die.

601
00:51:30,641 --> 00:51:32,408
Do you understand that, Don?

602
00:51:41,651 --> 00:51:43,552
We're gonna pray all night.

603
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:47,554
I'm gonna call everybody
I know who can pray.

604
00:51:49,824 --> 00:51:54,026
I want you to know that all
of us who care about you

605
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,662
will be up all night

606
00:51:56,664 --> 00:51:58,196
in prayer for you.

607
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,466
We're taking over from here.

608
00:52:06,237 --> 00:52:08,358
We're gonna take care of this.

609
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:24,119
He's in bad shape.

610
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:26,655
Emotionally,
there's no will to live.

611
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:33,694
What is there left
for us to do?

612
00:52:33,696 --> 00:52:35,429
Pray.

613
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:38,366
<i>We all have talents.</i>

614
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:40,735
<i>David's was organizing.</i>

615
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:43,972
<i>He was able to rally churches</i>
<i>from all over the world</i>

616
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:47,375
<i>to pray for me</i>
<i>simply by faxing them.</i>

617
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,453
How long will
my dad be like this?

618
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:57,556
Well, it's gonna take
some time to heal.

619
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:03,295
All I do is press
my palms together.

620
00:54:03,297 --> 00:54:04,963
It's not doing anything.

621
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:08,067
It's not making my mom
happy or my dad better.

622
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:11,003
Well, honey,
you gotta keep praying.

623
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:13,473
You know what they say
about faith.

624
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:15,741
You can have hope
without faith,

625
00:54:15,743 --> 00:54:18,610
but you can't have faith
without hope.

626
00:54:20,713 --> 00:54:22,814
Grandma loves you.

627
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:24,215
I love you too.

628
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:25,817
My sweet baby.

629
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:28,252
I want you to go
to sleep now, okay?

630
00:54:28,254 --> 00:54:30,053
I love you.

631
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:31,789
I'll see you in the morning.

632
00:54:40,499 --> 00:54:42,901
- Eva.
- Morning, Doctor.

633
00:54:46,405 --> 00:54:49,241
Don has developed
pneumonia in both lungs.

634
00:54:49,243 --> 00:54:51,376
If we can't do something
about his breathing,

635
00:54:51,378 --> 00:54:53,910
we're gonna have to do
something else drastic.

636
00:54:56,281 --> 00:54:57,914
How drastic?

637
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:04,554
The Ilizarov device stabilizes,

638
00:55:04,556 --> 00:55:08,191
and then at the same time, if
successful, which is a huge if,

639
00:55:08,193 --> 00:55:11,861
what it does is it stretches the
bone by pulling on both ends.

640
00:55:12,964 --> 00:55:15,598
See, new bone is created

641
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,403
by actually breaking the leg above
and below the original breaks.

642
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:25,041
We push the broken ends
closer and closer together

643
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:29,277
until they meet and then
they form a new femur.

644
00:55:30,546 --> 00:55:32,380
Will that work?
Ah, that's just it.

645
00:55:32,382 --> 00:55:34,614
I can't guarantee
that it'll work.

646
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:39,486
We can't give him the kind
of breathing treatments he needs

647
00:55:39,488 --> 00:55:41,921
as long he's
in the prone position.

648
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:43,757
See, we have to elevate him.

649
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:46,559
And that leaves us
with two choices.

650
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:50,930
One is that
we amputate the leg.

651
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:55,602
And the other is that we
try this Ilizarov device

652
00:55:55,604 --> 00:55:58,571
which is called the fixator.

653
00:55:58,573 --> 00:56:02,576
People take sometimes
months of counseling

654
00:56:02,578 --> 00:56:05,845
before they allow
this device to be used on them.

655
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:08,849
And, of course, in Don's case
we don't have that kind of time.

656
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:12,453
But there is a chance
to save the leg?

657
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:14,321
There is a chance.

658
00:56:19,427 --> 00:56:21,494
May I have a moment, please?

659
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:23,829
Of course.

660
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:54,728
I didn't realize you were home.

661
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,797
Brought the kids by
to pick up a few things.

662
00:56:57,799 --> 00:57:00,667
It doesn't feel like a home.
There's no, "Hi, Mom."

663
00:57:00,669 --> 00:57:03,703
Eva, it's gonna get better.

664
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:06,239
But how much worse?

665
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:08,908
We can't pay for anything.

666
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,644
This house is a mess.

667
00:57:11,646 --> 00:57:13,980
He might not come home.

668
00:57:13,982 --> 00:57:15,815
Will he even survive?

669
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,318
He might never walk again.

670
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,887
I'm so afraid.

671
00:57:21,889 --> 00:57:23,822
It's gonna be fine.

672
00:57:23,824 --> 00:57:27,393
We're gonna get through
this together as a family.

673
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:29,094
That's what families do.

674
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,416
Shh.

675
00:57:51,418 --> 00:57:53,451
I'm here.

676
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,120
I'm here. Help!

677
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,088
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

678
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:01,992
It's okay. It's okay.

679
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,527
It's okay.

680
00:58:04,529 --> 00:58:06,061
What is that?

681
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:11,466
It's a bone growth device.

682
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:15,203
What is that?

683
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,971
What is that?

684
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:18,940
A fixator.

685
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:24,044
Dr. Greider says it's the only chance
we have to save your leg. Okay?

686
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:26,647
Shh.

687
00:58:26,649 --> 00:58:30,291
And those rods go all
the way through my leg?

688
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:33,287
It's a new... And my arm?

689
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:35,622
It's a new technique.

690
00:58:35,624 --> 00:58:37,691
Shh.

691
00:58:39,393 --> 00:58:41,460
I believe it's worth the risk.

692
00:58:41,462 --> 00:58:43,962
Why did you let them
do this to me?

693
00:58:45,764 --> 00:58:47,164
Huh?

694
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:55,105
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

695
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:58,674
<i>these were the only fireworks left
in our marriage at this point.</i>

696
00:58:59,442 --> 00:59:01,043
Rodeo's over.

697
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:08,751
Fireworks are on.

698
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,652
<i>Eva's decision to keep my leg</i>

699
00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:15,824
<i>was so that I could continue to enjoy
skiing and biking with the children.</i>

700
00:59:15,826 --> 00:59:19,061
<i>I always felt bad about</i>
<i>how I spoke to her that day.</i>

701
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:27,902
Try to control your breathing.
Slow it down.

702
00:59:30,773 --> 00:59:33,474
You can scream if you want.

703
00:59:40,148 --> 00:59:42,047
Easy.

704
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,017
This pain...

705
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:47,918
I know.

706
00:59:49,354 --> 00:59:51,054
Almost done.

707
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,526
Good morning, Doctor.

708
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:02,965
How long do I have
to endure this device?

709
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,102
How long before I...

710
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:09,938
I know if it works?

711
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:14,309
How long before
I can walk again?

712
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,044
A few months.

713
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:20,115
How few?

714
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,217
Many months. Maybe more.

715
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,753
You mean possibly a few years?

716
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:28,655
A year maybe.

717
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:30,257
I really don't know.

718
01:00:31,993 --> 01:00:35,996
And there's no guarantee that I'm
gonna be able to keep these limbs?

719
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:38,064
No guarantee.

720
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:41,267
You could develop an infection and
we'd have to amputate the leg.

721
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:50,242
So I could endure this for months
and still end up with no leg?

722
01:00:50,244 --> 01:00:53,878
I'm hoping your left arm
has a better chance.

723
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,615
We took bones
from your right pelvis

724
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:58,249
and put them
in your left forearm.

725
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:03,587
It's kind of like
taking core samples

726
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:06,123
when you're drilling
for oil, as an example.

727
01:01:24,444 --> 01:01:29,146
We're going to have to move Mr. Piper to St.
Luke's tomorrow.

728
01:01:30,883 --> 01:01:33,818
Why do we have to move him?

729
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,341
I believe Don should
be able to stay here.

730
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:39,855
I agree.

731
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:43,726
But this is out of my hands.

732
01:01:45,395 --> 01:01:50,399
I've done everything I know
to prevent this from happening.

733
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:52,134
But I can't stop it.

734
01:01:58,741 --> 01:02:00,442
There's a situation
at the hospital.

735
01:02:00,444 --> 01:02:03,745
Our insurance no longer covers
Don's treatment here.

736
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:06,849
Is there anything you can do?

737
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:09,318
I need answers.
<i>Yes, of course you do.</i>

738
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,021
<i>I'm your Beau. You at the hospital?
</i> Yes.

739
01:02:12,023 --> 01:02:15,924
<i>Meet me in the cafeteria.</i>

740
01:02:19,596 --> 01:02:22,998
<i>I tried, but the administrator's right.
They're not gonna budge.</i>

741
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,636
There's nothing you can do
to change things?

742
01:02:27,638 --> 01:02:31,707
It's about what the hospital can
get from the insurance company.

743
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:35,210
What about our case?
Our settlement?

744
01:02:35,212 --> 01:02:37,880
Well, I've got good news
and I've got bad news,

745
01:02:37,882 --> 01:02:42,351
but the bad news takes out the good news,
so all we're left with really is bad news.

746
01:02:42,353 --> 01:02:44,152
What?

747
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:48,490
Well, in Texas, state employees are
indemnified by the State of Texas.

748
01:02:48,492 --> 01:02:51,793
Okay, how does this affect us?

749
01:02:51,795 --> 01:02:54,396
Well, the state,
in this case, Texas,

750
01:02:54,398 --> 01:02:59,633
has put a cap on all damages
that are able to be collected

751
01:02:59,635 --> 01:03:01,969
in any lawsuit
against the state.

752
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:04,338
And the cap is $250,000.

753
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:09,143
Now, insurance companies,
they have subrogation rights,

754
01:03:09,145 --> 01:03:12,080
which means that
they're gonna put a lien

755
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:15,750
against any kind
of claim and settlement

756
01:03:15,752 --> 01:03:19,821
or any funds received from a lawsuit,
to cover their medical expenses.

757
01:03:19,823 --> 01:03:21,856
In other words,

758
01:03:21,858 --> 01:03:25,093
your insurance company
is gonna take all the money.

759
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:27,394
Don will receive nothing?

760
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:31,498
No. You know, I had a friend
one time, he asked me.

761
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,837
He said, "What kind of cookies you
bake when you don't have any money?"

762
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:40,440
I said, "I don't know. What?"
He said, "Shortbread."

763
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:43,577
Unfortunately, Don's gonna have to
bake shortbread cookies on this one.

764
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:47,447
He'd been better off if he'd
been hit by a Budweiser truck.

765
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:51,785
And then we'd all be talking
about millions of dollars.

766
01:03:53,754 --> 01:03:57,891
Sorry. Partner,
can I give you that card?

767
01:03:57,893 --> 01:04:02,028
You show up here
just to tell me this?

768
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,896
<i>How we gonna do this?</i>

769
01:04:03,898 --> 01:04:07,834
We'll take him by ambulance.
You can drive your car.

770
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:16,076
<i>Even though St. Luke's was</i>
<i>only five blocks away,</i>

771
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:20,714
<i>it was such a painful move with
the fixators on my leg and arm.</i>

772
01:04:20,716 --> 01:04:24,218
<i>Every bump resonated</i>
<i>through my bones.</i>

773
01:04:27,555 --> 01:04:29,222
<i>Eva stayed strong,</i>

774
01:04:29,224 --> 01:04:32,426
<i>tried not to cry out as she</i>
<i>watched me go through this.</i>

775
01:04:32,428 --> 01:04:36,297
It's not very pretty here.

776
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:41,682
It's not ideal. I'm sorry.

777
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:48,844
I'm so sorry, Don.

778
01:04:58,588 --> 01:05:03,526
When they picked this color blue,
it must have been a cloudy day.

779
01:05:09,366 --> 01:05:12,986
Mr. Piper, Mrs. Piper, how
you guys doing today?

780
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:14,537
Hi there. Thank you.

781
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:18,808
Good, good. I've got some
relief for you, Mr. Piper.

782
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:22,811
I'm gonna take good care of you, okay?
Let me just have that arm.

783
01:05:22,813 --> 01:05:27,282
I'm gonna just
hook this up for you,

784
01:05:27,284 --> 01:05:29,525
and this will make you
feel a lot better.

785
01:05:34,823 --> 01:05:36,791
All righty.

786
01:05:36,793 --> 01:05:39,493
This is real simple, Mr. Piper.

787
01:05:39,495 --> 01:05:42,196
All you need to do is...

788
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:49,370
Anytime you feel
you need some relief,

789
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:54,375
this will just
take it all away for you.

790
01:05:54,377 --> 01:05:56,810
All I need you to do is push
this little button here,

791
01:05:56,812 --> 01:05:59,646
and it releases medication.

792
01:05:59,648 --> 01:06:02,349
All right?

793
01:06:02,351 --> 01:06:05,318
And just call me if you need me.
All right, Mrs. Piper?

794
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,921
- Thank you.
- All right. You're welcome.

795
01:06:19,234 --> 01:06:22,603
Mr. Piper and Mrs. Piper,
how you doing today?

796
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:24,672
We're fine, thank you. Good.

797
01:06:24,674 --> 01:06:27,541
And how about him?

798
01:06:27,543 --> 01:06:29,342
Hey, Mr. Piper.

799
01:06:30,211 --> 01:06:33,546
So, have you eaten today?

800
01:06:33,548 --> 01:06:35,581
Hmm?

801
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,617
Did you have therapy today?

802
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:41,788
Did Dr. Greider come by?

803
01:06:43,892 --> 01:06:47,660
Have you had
a bowel movement today?

804
01:06:48,895 --> 01:06:50,595
Maybe that's why
you're so grumpy.

805
01:06:52,698 --> 01:06:55,534
All right, I'll be back
later to check up on you.

806
01:06:55,536 --> 01:06:59,070
Just let me know if I can get
you anything. Thank you.

807
01:06:59,072 --> 01:07:00,605
You're welcome.

808
01:07:15,155 --> 01:07:17,122
Why don't you talk?

809
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,881
I can't figure out what's
going on inside of you.

810
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,169
What happened to you?

811
01:07:35,507 --> 01:07:38,076
Talk to me.

812
01:07:38,078 --> 01:07:41,680
Don, answer me.

813
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:48,187
I'm sitting right here. Please.
Why aren't you answering me?

814
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:55,160
Where do you go?

815
01:07:59,264 --> 01:08:01,733
You're not even here anymore.

816
01:08:10,443 --> 01:08:13,179
Is there something
you want to tell me?

817
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,453
Where's my husband?

818
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,226
He's not here.

819
01:08:39,473 --> 01:08:41,506
I miss him.

820
01:08:45,145 --> 01:08:48,147
Should I get that for you?

821
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:50,229
Should I answer that for you?

822
01:08:55,388 --> 01:08:57,522
Hello?

823
01:08:57,524 --> 01:09:00,359
How's Don?

824
01:09:00,361 --> 01:09:05,597
He doesn't talk, he lies here,
and he doesn't seem to care.

825
01:09:07,266 --> 01:09:10,067
- Hi, Dad.
- Let me call you back. Okay.

826
01:09:10,069 --> 01:09:11,669
What's that?

827
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:15,172
<i>I know I should have been</i>
<i>grateful to be alive.</i>

828
01:09:15,174 --> 01:09:19,076
<i>My downcast attitude was</i>
<i>taking its toll on everyone.</i>

829
01:09:19,078 --> 01:09:22,345
<i>But I just felt like</i>
<i>something was missing</i>

830
01:09:22,347 --> 01:09:25,082
<i>and I didn't deserve to be here.
</i> Hi, Daddy.

831
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:33,256
Okay, kids, it's time to get on the road.
We need to not tire out your father.

832
01:09:33,258 --> 01:09:36,260
It's okay, Dad. I'm gonna take them
on the first floor to the McDonald's.

833
01:09:36,262 --> 01:09:38,461
Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on.

834
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:45,701
Are you okay, Mom?

835
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:47,269
Yeah.

836
01:09:49,873 --> 01:09:53,153
I never would have dreamed that
cheeseburger and fries would be so good.

837
01:09:58,047 --> 01:09:59,748
I'm in love with french fries.

838
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:03,051
You're in love
with french fries?

839
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:04,652
Me too.

840
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:11,826
Do you think Dad will be home
for my birthday?

841
01:10:14,496 --> 01:10:19,500
I hope so. I know he wants to.

842
01:10:19,502 --> 01:10:23,270
Grandpa, um,
makes us do our homework

843
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:26,240
<i>before</i> we go to the lake.

844
01:10:26,242 --> 01:10:28,942
As he should.

845
01:10:28,944 --> 01:10:31,178
But he doesn't help us
like you do.

846
01:10:54,037 --> 01:10:58,673
Don, I came to say good night.

847
01:11:02,045 --> 01:11:04,413
You don't want to say
good night?

848
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,722
I am tired of this.

849
01:11:16,326 --> 01:11:18,695
You don't seem to care
about anything.

850
01:11:20,564 --> 01:11:23,533
You don't care that
you're back here with us.

851
01:11:27,137 --> 01:11:30,540
You don't care when the children
come and visit you.

852
01:11:35,312 --> 01:11:37,614
You don't want to grow old
with me?

853
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:43,385
Or see the children
get married?

854
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:47,789
You don't care.

855
01:11:53,763 --> 01:11:56,664
You can take your pain away
with that button,

856
01:11:56,666 --> 01:12:00,402
but you are causing it
to everyone else.

857
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:38,107
<i>Welcome to McDonald's.</i>
<i>Can I take your order?</i>

858
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:26,253
<i>Sorry. That's not on the menu.</i>

859
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:40,400
Lord.

860
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:47,507
Oh, God...

861
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:52,678
Does it really
have to be like this?

862
01:14:00,188 --> 01:14:04,823
The pain... of the injuries,

863
01:14:04,825 --> 01:14:06,725
I can handle that.

864
01:14:11,898 --> 01:14:14,966
Even seeing the pity

865
01:14:14,968 --> 01:14:19,871
and the helplessness in the
eyes of the people who love me

866
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:22,406
and care for me...

867
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:25,710
I can get through that.

868
01:14:32,484 --> 01:14:35,118
But if this is as good
as it's ever gonna get,

869
01:14:42,194 --> 01:14:44,127
I don't wanna be a burden.

870
01:14:45,329 --> 01:14:47,664
I was just trying
to get back to Alvin,

871
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:49,966
and you took me to heaven.

872
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:55,571
Why can't you take me back?

873
01:15:00,877 --> 01:15:02,577
Now.

874
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:11,019
I wanna go back to heaven,

875
01:15:15,024 --> 01:15:17,526
my home.

876
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:23,598
My home is heaven now.

877
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:29,703
Oh, Jesus, let me
come back home, please.

878
01:15:36,644 --> 01:15:39,478
Please let me come back home.

879
01:16:14,849 --> 01:16:18,785
Well, South Park hired me
to be your interim

880
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,020
while you're, uh,
incapacitated,

881
01:16:21,022 --> 01:16:23,890
so I guess you can say
I'm out of retirement.

882
01:16:27,261 --> 01:16:30,197
Uh, can I get you a magazine?

883
01:16:34,468 --> 01:16:37,204
Would-Would you like a...
a milk shake?

884
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:44,845
How about a hamburger? You lost
quite a bit of weight, son.

885
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:54,456
Would you like for me to

886
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:57,559
read to you from the Bible?

887
01:16:57,561 --> 01:16:59,361
Or any other book,
for that matter?

888
01:16:59,363 --> 01:17:03,331
Really, no.

889
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:05,967
Thanks for coming.

890
01:17:15,043 --> 01:17:17,364
You know, you really need
to get your act together.

891
01:17:21,149 --> 01:17:24,018
Sir? You need to get
your act together.

892
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:26,720
You're not doing
a very good job right now.

893
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:29,990
Uh, I'm not sure I understand.

894
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:34,894
Besides that,
you're a raging hypocrite.

895
01:17:34,896 --> 01:17:37,831
I don't know what
you're talking...

896
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:41,669
You got all these people
out there

897
01:17:41,671 --> 01:17:45,005
who care so much for you, and you
have no idea how much they love you.

898
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:46,673
I know they love me.
Oh, really?

899
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:49,076
Yeah. Well, you're doing
a pretty poor job

900
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:51,178
of letting them know
you're aware of that fact.

901
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,946
I don't think you're treating
them right.

902
01:17:52,948 --> 01:17:57,851
Now, they can't heal you, but they
would heal you if they could.

903
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:02,922
And if they could trade places with
you, many of them would do that.

904
01:18:02,924 --> 01:18:03,618
Yeah...

905
01:18:03,644 --> 01:18:06,393
And do anything for
you without any waver.

906
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:08,315
I don't want them
to do anything.

907
01:18:12,867 --> 01:18:15,034
Truth is, I don't even
want them to be here.

908
01:18:15,036 --> 01:18:17,636
I'd just as soon they not come.

909
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:20,805
I-I-I know it's inconvenient.

910
01:18:20,807 --> 01:18:23,875
They must have better things to do.
I know that.

911
01:18:23,877 --> 01:18:27,878
Why would I want anyone
to come see me like this?

912
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,747
Huh?

913
01:18:29,749 --> 01:18:33,650
It's awful.

914
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:38,221
It's not your call.

915
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:41,725
It's not about you.

916
01:18:41,727 --> 01:18:46,095
You spent the better part of your life
trying to minister to other people.

917
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:48,731
Trying to be there
for their needs.

918
01:18:48,733 --> 01:18:52,267
And to be there for them
through difficulty and tragedy.

919
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,902
I-I've tried to.

920
01:18:53,904 --> 01:18:59,774
And yet you have deprived them
of doing the same thing for you.

921
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,342
And that's all they have
to offer you, Don.

922
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:07,514
And you're taking that gift
away from them.

923
01:19:07,516 --> 01:19:11,085
I appreciate them. I do.

924
01:19:11,087 --> 01:19:14,455
I-I know they want to help, and I
think that's very fine and all,

925
01:19:14,457 --> 01:19:16,417
but... But nothing!

926
01:19:20,861 --> 01:19:24,030
Now, I want you to let
them in, you hear me?

927
01:19:24,032 --> 01:19:29,035
You're going to let them in
and let 'em help you.

928
01:19:29,037 --> 01:19:30,936
I can't.

929
01:19:34,307 --> 01:19:37,909
Well, if you don't feel
like you can for yourself,

930
01:19:39,378 --> 01:19:41,699
what about doing it for me?

931
01:19:44,884 --> 01:19:48,187
What about next time somebody walks through
that door and wants to do something for you...

932
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:51,690
I don't care what it is...
say yes.

933
01:19:51,692 --> 01:19:57,830
Let a few folks express their
love by doing something for you.

934
01:19:57,832 --> 01:20:00,633
I mean, promise me
that you'll do that.

935
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:02,568
Just...

936
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:06,739
Look, just try it for me.

937
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:12,044
You're gonna need
to get better at this.

938
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:14,880
Now, this is one of the lessons
that God wants you to learn.

939
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:20,385
All right, I promise.

940
01:20:24,256 --> 01:20:27,992
People are God's hands

941
01:20:27,994 --> 01:20:32,397
to meet your needs
and answer your prayers.

942
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:41,107
We'll just keep looking
till it feels right.

943
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:44,076
What kind of house
are we looking for?

944
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:48,881
Well, probably something
one-story.

945
01:20:48,883 --> 01:20:52,618
Manageable to get around in
for Dad.

946
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:57,356
Is Dad gonna be in a wheelchair?
Yeah.

947
01:20:57,358 --> 01:20:59,058
For a little while.

948
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,393
<i>As the medical bills</i>
<i>were mounting,</i>

949
01:21:01,395 --> 01:21:04,596
<i>Eva looked for a house</i>
<i>that we could afford,</i>

950
01:21:04,598 --> 01:21:08,299
<i>that would accommodate my needs once
I was discharged from St. Luke's.</i>

951
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:12,704
Hey, hey, hey. There he is.

952
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:15,173
Got something for you.

953
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,815
Look, let me do it.
Looks like you need my help.

954
01:21:23,817 --> 01:21:26,918
How are you today?

955
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,421
Not speaking to me again?

956
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:32,891
Hmm. Okay. It's a letter.

957
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:35,060
It says, "Hi, there.
We share wrenches."

958
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:38,496
Fortunately for both of us, our
fixators are interchangeable.

959
01:21:38,498 --> 01:21:42,133
"And we can borrow tools from
one another." That's so cute.

960
01:21:42,135 --> 01:21:44,235
Look it there.
It's a happy face.

961
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:47,439
Who is this?
Oh, this is from Christy.

962
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:50,241
Christy is a teenage girl
that lives in the next room.

963
01:21:50,243 --> 01:21:52,911
She was born with one leg
shorter than the other.

964
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:57,147
So she had to have surgery to attach
the Ilizarov frame, like yours,

965
01:21:57,149 --> 01:21:59,016
so that both legs
would be of normal size.

966
01:21:59,018 --> 01:22:02,285
She has a fixator too?
She goes on.

967
01:22:02,287 --> 01:22:05,622
"And we share
something else too. Pain."

968
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:09,258
She says, "I hear you scream at night
sometimes as you probably hear me too."

969
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:14,464
Although our nurse says
that you don't admit to it."

970
01:22:14,466 --> 01:22:18,769
Don't-Don't-Don't shoot me now. I'm
just the messenger, Mr. Piper.

971
01:22:18,771 --> 01:22:23,320
And she goes on and says,
"You're not alone.

972
01:22:23,346 --> 01:22:25,443
Sincerely, Christy."

973
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:28,546
That is so sweet.

974
01:22:28,548 --> 01:22:31,882
Can you get me a pen
and paper, please?

975
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:36,119
I can if you acknowledge me.

976
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:40,489
There you go.

977
01:22:40,491 --> 01:22:43,292
I like that. All right.

978
01:22:43,294 --> 01:22:45,860
I'll be right back.
That's my boy.

979
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:54,169
<i>Dear Christy, in some of my
worst moments of self-pity,</i>

980
01:22:54,171 --> 01:22:57,172
<i>I think of never</i>
<i>being normal again.</i>

981
01:22:57,174 --> 01:23:01,009
<i>I believe that when all of
the pain is over, Christy,</i>

982
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:03,144
<i>you will be</i>
<i>a normal young woman.</i>

983
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:07,848
<i>You will play and run and do</i>
<i>everything a normal teen can do.</i>

984
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:12,753
<i>You're doing something that positively
impacts the rest of your life.</i>

985
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:16,924
<i>Keep the faith. Kindest, Don.</i>

986
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:21,760
<i>If God brings you to it,</i>

987
01:23:21,762 --> 01:23:23,395
<i>he will bring you through it.</i>

988
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:41,845
It's not long
before you go home.

989
01:23:41,847 --> 01:23:44,681
This is your first step
in that direction.

990
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:55,025
My first step
is wanting to vomit.

991
01:23:55,027 --> 01:23:57,260
Yeah, nausea will get you
every time.

992
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:59,730
Your equilibrium has changed.

993
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:02,699
You've grown used to being
in a horizontal position.

994
01:24:02,701 --> 01:24:04,534
I'd like my tools back.

995
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:09,138
Hi. I'm Christy,
your long-lost pen pal.

996
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:12,041
Or Hopalong Cassidy,
as my friends say.

997
01:24:12,043 --> 01:24:16,111
Hi. I'm Don.

998
01:24:17,814 --> 01:24:21,315
How are you? Could be worse.

999
01:24:21,317 --> 01:24:23,584
How's that?

1000
01:24:23,586 --> 01:24:26,119
Okay, you got me.
It can't get much worse.

1001
01:24:26,121 --> 01:24:30,557
The endless reruns OO AM?

1002
01:24:32,393 --> 01:24:35,396
Yeah, well,
I wish my only problem

1003
01:24:35,398 --> 01:24:38,031
was getting hit in the face
with a football like Marcia.

1004
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:42,369
I'd take a broken nose
to dance normal.

1005
01:24:45,506 --> 01:24:47,307
You'll dance.

1006
01:24:52,078 --> 01:24:54,884
Only the truest friends show
up when you have to move.

1007
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,414
Trust me, this is a vacation.

1008
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:59,084
Oh, vacation?
Yes, from my children.

1009
01:24:59,086 --> 01:25:02,754
Ah, well, thank you.

1010
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:05,615
Remember when Don's parents
gave us this painting?

1011
01:25:05,641 --> 01:25:06,792
Oh, yes, I remember.

1012
01:25:06,794 --> 01:25:10,495
I remember you tried to pawn it
off on me, and then Susan,

1013
01:25:10,497 --> 01:25:13,098
and the Goodwill store.
That's not true!

1014
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,266
That is true. I never told Don.

1015
01:25:19,373 --> 01:25:23,109
Is all this stuff going to fit
in the new house? I think so.

1016
01:25:23,111 --> 01:25:24,710
This place just isn't
gonna work for Don.

1017
01:25:24,712 --> 01:25:27,612
You know, with all the stairs
and him being in a wheelchair.

1018
01:25:27,614 --> 01:25:30,782
Plus, the new home
is closer to the church.

1019
01:25:30,784 --> 01:25:33,284
That will be nice.

1020
01:25:37,356 --> 01:25:40,992
Just came by to check on you,
see how you were doing.

1021
01:25:40,994 --> 01:25:45,996
You're looking good. I hear you're
gonna be going home before long.

1022
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:48,699
Anything I can do for you
before I go?

1023
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:51,802
That-That's a very fine offer.

1024
01:25:51,804 --> 01:25:54,305
Um...

1025
01:25:54,307 --> 01:25:57,741
- I wish I had a magazine to read.
- You do?

1026
01:25:57,743 --> 01:26:01,811
Really? I think so.

1027
01:26:01,813 --> 01:26:03,712
I-I haven't read one
in a while.

1028
01:26:05,148 --> 01:26:07,382
Well, all right.
Give me just a minute.

1029
01:26:07,384 --> 01:26:10,853
<i>Jay B. Perkins,</i>
<i>a retired minister,</i>

1030
01:26:10,855 --> 01:26:12,988
<i>was a powerful</i>
<i>father figure to me.</i>

1031
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:17,159
<i>And I was grateful for his service to
my church while I was incapacitated.</i>

1032
01:26:17,161 --> 01:26:18,760
This ought to do you.

1033
01:26:20,028 --> 01:26:22,229
There you go.
Th-Th-Thank you much.

1034
01:26:22,231 --> 01:26:24,432
That'll keep you busy.
I'll read them a bit later.

1035
01:26:24,434 --> 01:26:26,700
Yeah. Anything else I can do?

1036
01:26:26,702 --> 01:26:29,770
No, that's... that's all I need.
Thank you.

1037
01:26:29,772 --> 01:26:31,438
You know,
when you open the door

1038
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,409
and let somebody do
something nice for you,

1039
01:26:35,411 --> 01:26:38,244
it turns out not to be
so hard after all, huh?

1040
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:40,680
You were right, J.B.

1041
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:47,620
I thought that relieving people
of the responsibility

1042
01:26:47,622 --> 01:26:51,190
of having to care for me
was the right thing to do.

1043
01:26:53,961 --> 01:26:56,095
It wasn't.

1044
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,367
They would heal me if they could,
and since they can't do that,

1045
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:05,538
they were caring for me in...
in the only way that they can.

1046
01:27:08,074 --> 01:27:12,211
I have denied them the...

1047
01:27:12,213 --> 01:27:15,080
the blessing of caring.

1048
01:27:15,082 --> 01:27:18,283
You've loved me enough
to tell me the truth.

1049
01:27:19,218 --> 01:27:21,118
I won't forget it.

1050
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,295
<i>And I never have.</i>

1051
01:27:34,566 --> 01:27:39,403
<i>After 34 surgeries and nearly
four months in the hospital,</i>

1052
01:27:39,405 --> 01:27:42,106
<i>Dr. Greider said</i>
<i>I could go home.</i>

1053
01:27:42,108 --> 01:27:43,674
Bye. Thank you.

1054
01:27:44,809 --> 01:27:48,245
Dr. Greider. Hold up a sec.

1055
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:52,115
Tell me something.

1056
01:27:52,117 --> 01:27:55,785
Just how bad was I when they brought
me in the night of the accident?

1057
01:27:55,787 --> 01:27:57,353
I've seen worse.

1058
01:27:58,254 --> 01:28:00,489
But they didn't live.

1059
01:28:03,526 --> 01:28:04,927
Thank you, sir.

1060
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:07,162
<i>He would become a friend of
mine from that day forward.</i>

1061
01:28:07,164 --> 01:28:08,863
Bye, Christy. Bye.

1062
01:28:08,865 --> 01:28:11,726
I want you to call me
when you get out of here.

1063
01:28:11,752 --> 01:28:12,525
Will do.

1064
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,198
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey, Dad.

1065
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,634
How do you like the new house?

1066
01:28:45,969 --> 01:28:50,072
What do you think? Welcome home, Daddy.
Welcome home.

1067
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:53,910
- I think I'm home.
- There's the kitchen.

1068
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,879
Did you put milk in it?
I'm just gonna do this.

1069
01:29:04,588 --> 01:29:08,990
I know. Is it good? Mm-hmm.

1070
01:29:08,992 --> 01:29:12,160
Smells good in there.

1071
01:29:14,664 --> 01:29:18,266
Why don't you... We're gonna play a game.
Okay, you ready?

1072
01:29:20,502 --> 01:29:23,905
<i>Eva organized something</i>
<i>called "The Don Patrol,"</i>

1073
01:29:23,907 --> 01:29:26,374
<i>a group of church members and
friends who took care of me</i>

1074
01:29:26,376 --> 01:29:30,845
<i>so that she could teach</i>
<i>and we could keep our insurance.</i>

1075
01:29:30,847 --> 01:29:34,916
<i>The Don Patrol would arrive around
9:00 while I was still sleeping.</i>

1076
01:29:36,885 --> 01:29:38,452
Good morning.

1077
01:29:38,454 --> 01:29:40,454
<i>I might awake to seeing</i>
<i>one of the Susans</i>

1078
01:29:40,456 --> 01:29:42,690
<i>knitting on the couch</i>
<i>at the end of my bed.</i>

1079
01:29:43,925 --> 01:29:45,892
<i>Or someone would be there</i>
<i>with a toothbrush</i>

1080
01:29:45,894 --> 01:29:48,762
- <i> so I could brush my teeth.</i>
- Looking good.

1081
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:52,600
<i>Oftentimes holding a glass of juice
before I was done doing that.</i>

1082
01:29:52,602 --> 01:29:55,536
<i>Maybe even offering</i>
<i>an electric shaver.</i>

1083
01:29:55,538 --> 01:30:00,041
All right, I've never actually
used one of these before.

1084
01:30:00,043 --> 01:30:01,709
It's pretty simple.

1085
01:30:03,878 --> 01:30:06,380
You know what?
It doesn't actually work.

1086
01:30:06,382 --> 01:30:08,382
<i>And a big lunch.</i>

1087
01:30:08,384 --> 01:30:13,320
Turkey sandwich,
oatmeal cookie, pickles.

1088
01:30:13,322 --> 01:30:15,388
You can't pass up baby pickles.

1089
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:16,990
I'll take the apple. Okay.

1090
01:30:16,992 --> 01:30:21,260
Another friend might be reading the
newspaper, ready to entertain me.

1091
01:30:21,262 --> 01:30:23,763
Yeah, whatever you need.

1092
01:30:23,765 --> 01:30:25,798
I'll even sing for you
if you want.

1093
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,702
Some guests would even make
themselves quite comfortable.

1094
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:36,441
Hey, Butterfly.

1095
01:30:36,443 --> 01:30:39,844
Come here.

1096
01:30:39,846 --> 01:30:41,513
Butterfly.

1097
01:30:41,515 --> 01:30:44,415
No!

1098
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:45,849
Butterfly, no!

1099
01:30:46,818 --> 01:30:48,318
Hey!

1100
01:30:51,121 --> 01:30:55,024
Hi, honey. Everything okay?

1101
01:30:55,026 --> 01:30:56,658
Uh-huh.

1102
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,829
You sure? Yeah.

1103
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:09,671
It smells like pee in here.
I know. It was the dog.

1104
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:14,276
It's okay if you can't make it
to the bathroom.

1105
01:31:14,278 --> 01:31:18,447
It was the dog.

1106
01:31:19,282 --> 01:31:20,715
Butterfly?

1107
01:31:28,792 --> 01:31:30,893
Hey, Dad.

1108
01:32:32,127 --> 01:32:33,727
Come on.

1109
01:32:33,729 --> 01:32:35,763
You can do it.

1110
01:32:55,252 --> 01:32:55,752
Aaah!

1111
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:03,891
I did it.

1112
01:33:09,397 --> 01:33:12,065
I did it.

1113
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:17,069
I walked!

1114
01:33:17,071 --> 01:33:19,071
I walked.

1115
01:33:19,073 --> 01:33:22,140
Oh, Lord, I walked.

1116
01:33:34,989 --> 01:33:38,658
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

1117
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:41,261
Ma'am. Ma'am. Where Don?
Where's my husband?

1118
01:33:41,263 --> 01:33:45,031
Ma'am. I'd like for you to
consider this as a private matter.

1119
01:33:45,033 --> 01:33:46,165
Private? Private.

1120
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:48,768
This is my house. I've seen it all.
Hey.

1121
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:51,837
- Bet you haven't seen this yet.
- What's going on?

1122
01:33:55,108 --> 01:33:59,011
I, uh, got my fixator
stuck to the toilet seat.

1123
01:33:59,013 --> 01:34:00,112
Oh.

1124
01:34:00,114 --> 01:34:03,148
Happy birthday!

1125
01:34:11,691 --> 01:34:16,895
This is a perfect day. God has given me
children so much better than I deserve.

1126
01:34:16,897 --> 01:34:21,032
How can I ever thank you
for all they mean to me?

1127
01:34:26,839 --> 01:34:29,808
You being alive is the gift.

1128
01:34:33,313 --> 01:34:35,080
Dad, will you dance with me?

1129
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:37,748
Ah, sweetie, I'd like to, but...

1130
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:41,085
Please, Dad. Please?
I don't think I can.

1131
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:57,130
I might need you
to help me up here.

1132
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:39,472
David! What are you doing here?

1133
01:35:39,474 --> 01:35:41,708
I'm in town for
a discipleship weekend.

1134
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,210
It's the excuse I use

1135
01:35:44,212 --> 01:35:47,914
to come into the house
and spend time with you.

1136
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:51,217
Thank you for your friendship.

1137
01:35:51,219 --> 01:35:56,555
And your relentless
commitment to prayer.

1138
01:35:56,557 --> 01:35:58,598
Of course, Don.
How you feeling now?

1139
01:35:59,459 --> 01:36:03,929
In pain.
But I'm always in pain.

1140
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:07,199
That's... That's not the worst
part of it for me right now.

1141
01:36:09,835 --> 01:36:14,372
There are things I can't
physically do anymore.

1142
01:36:24,016 --> 01:36:28,253
I'm not sure that God wants me
to continue at South Park.

1143
01:36:28,255 --> 01:36:33,324
I feel loved and needed there, but
I'm not sure it's where I should be.

1144
01:36:38,196 --> 01:36:42,733
What did you learn from y-your
accident and your recovery experience?

1145
01:36:44,836 --> 01:36:47,038
Letting other people inside.

1146
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:50,307
Allowing others to help me.

1147
01:36:50,309 --> 01:36:55,379
But in the midst of all
the suffering and despondency,

1148
01:36:57,215 --> 01:36:58,716
David,

1149
01:37:02,619 --> 01:37:05,688
I've learned
that heaven is real.

1150
01:37:07,991 --> 01:37:11,694
- What do you mean by that?
- I died that day.

1151
01:37:16,533 --> 01:37:20,903
The next moment
I stood in heaven.

1152
01:37:28,213 --> 01:37:30,981
Why haven't you
mentioned this before?

1153
01:37:30,983 --> 01:37:35,019
I have two very good
reasons for that.

1154
01:37:35,021 --> 01:37:37,688
Number one, I go around talking
about having been to heaven,

1155
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:40,224
and people will think I'm nuts.

1156
01:37:40,226 --> 01:37:42,159
Why would you think that?
You just told me.

1157
01:37:42,161 --> 01:37:43,660
- Number two...
- I don't think you're nuts.

1158
01:37:43,662 --> 01:37:45,863
Number two, I don't wanna go
over that experience again.

1159
01:37:49,166 --> 01:37:52,735
It's too personal, too special.

1160
01:37:52,737 --> 01:37:54,837
It's my sacred secret.

1161
01:37:56,606 --> 01:38:00,509
Is it possible
that God took you to heaven,

1162
01:38:00,511 --> 01:38:05,747
brought you back so that you could
share your experience with others?

1163
01:38:05,749 --> 01:38:10,485
Don't you realize what a powerful
encouragement you could be?

1164
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:16,124
I want you to make
a covenant with me.

1165
01:38:16,126 --> 01:38:18,960
What kind of a covenant?
It's simple.

1166
01:38:18,962 --> 01:38:21,228
Find someone you trust.

1167
01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:24,432
Share a little bit about your story
just to gauge their response.

1168
01:38:24,434 --> 01:38:27,468
If they think you're crazy
or you hallucinated,

1169
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:32,440
I promise, I promise you never
have to talk about it again.

1170
01:38:35,545 --> 01:38:37,546
But if they rejoice with you

1171
01:38:37,548 --> 01:38:42,051
and urge you to tell them more,
I want you to take it as a sign.

1172
01:38:42,053 --> 01:38:46,322
A sign that God wants you to talk about
those 90 minutes you spent in heaven.

1173
01:38:50,226 --> 01:38:54,329
- I think I can do that much.
- When?

1174
01:38:54,331 --> 01:38:58,666
Soon. I promise.
Very soon, right?

1175
01:38:58,668 --> 01:39:01,368
All right. Very soon.

1176
01:39:06,575 --> 01:39:09,243
Hi, honey. Hi, darlin'.

1177
01:39:09,245 --> 01:39:12,947
Hey, David.
Glad you could make it.

1178
01:39:12,949 --> 01:39:15,082
Soon as in now.

1179
01:39:25,494 --> 01:39:27,495
Honey? Yes.

1180
01:39:34,938 --> 01:39:39,341
Darlin', I want to tell you something.
What's that?

1181
01:39:44,114 --> 01:39:48,017
Remember the day I-I left
for the convention? Uh-huh.

1182
01:39:48,019 --> 01:39:52,621
Well, that morning just plays
over and over in my head.

1183
01:39:52,623 --> 01:39:55,857
And you said, "I.O.U."

1184
01:39:57,292 --> 01:39:58,960
Yes. And I do.

1185
01:40:01,063 --> 01:40:03,864
Well, in fact,
I think I owe<i> you.</i>

1186
01:40:03,866 --> 01:40:08,268
Oh, don't I know it. I've been
waiting a long time for that.

1187
01:40:10,805 --> 01:40:13,139
I owe you an explanation.

1188
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:17,110
Darlin', would you sit down
for a second?

1189
01:40:18,145 --> 01:40:19,545
Please.

1190
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:36,397
You know,
I died in that accident.

1191
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:43,904
When I woke up,

1192
01:40:45,339 --> 01:40:47,140
I was in heaven.

1193
01:40:51,778 --> 01:40:53,346
You went to heaven?

1194
01:40:56,549 --> 01:40:58,284
Yes.

1195
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:02,287
Tell me more.

1196
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:10,128
When I died,

1197
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:13,631
I didn't flow through
a long dark tunnel.

1198
01:41:13,633 --> 01:41:15,065
Uh...

1199
01:41:15,067 --> 01:41:18,202
I had no sense of fading away
or coming back.

1200
01:41:18,204 --> 01:41:21,003
I heard no voices calling to
me or anything like that.

1201
01:41:23,607 --> 01:41:29,278
Simultaneous with my last
recollection of seeing the bridge,

1202
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,112
<i>the rain,</i>

1203
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:37,052
<i>a light enveloped me,</i>

1204
01:41:37,054 --> 01:41:39,254
<i>with a brilliance</i>

1205
01:41:39,256 --> 01:41:43,225
<i>beyond earthly comprehension</i>
<i>or description.</i>

1206
01:41:46,563 --> 01:41:52,568
<i>In my next moment of awareness,</i>
<i>I was standing in heaven.</i>

1207
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:54,736
<i>It was perfect.</i>

1208
01:41:54,738 --> 01:41:59,274
<i>And I knew right then I would have
no needs and never would again.</i>

1209
01:41:59,276 --> 01:42:04,246
<i>I didn't even think of Earth</i>
<i>or of those left behind.</i>

1210
01:42:04,248 --> 01:42:07,349
<i>Though I did not see Jesus</i>
<i>face-to-face,</i>

1211
01:42:07,351 --> 01:42:10,419
<i>I did sense his presence</i>
<i>at every turn.</i>

1212
01:42:10,421 --> 01:42:12,754
<i>And I did see people</i>
<i>I had known.</i>

1213
01:42:12,756 --> 01:42:15,323
<i>As they surged towards me,</i>

1214
01:42:15,325 --> 01:42:19,360
<i>I knew instantly that all of them
had died during my lifetime.</i>

1215
01:42:19,362 --> 01:42:23,765
<i>Their presence</i>
<i>seemed absolutely natural.</i>

1216
01:42:23,767 --> 01:42:29,471
<i>It was as if God had removed anything
negative or worrisome from my consciousness.</i>

1217
01:42:29,473 --> 01:42:33,274
<i>And I could only rejoice at being
together with these wonderful people.</i>

1218
01:42:33,276 --> 01:42:38,013
Donnie, I'm so excited
you're here to join us.

1219
01:42:41,684 --> 01:42:44,218
<i>I saw Papa.</i>

1220
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:47,388
<i>You know, my grandfather</i>
<i>that everyone called Joe.</i>

1221
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:51,893
<i>I heard his voice</i>
<i>and felt his embrace.</i>

1222
01:42:51,895 --> 01:42:54,896
<i>I'd been with him when he'd</i>
<i>suffered a heart attack at home</i>

1223
01:42:54,898 --> 01:42:57,966
<i>and had ridden with him</i>
<i>in the ambulance.</i>

1224
01:42:57,968 --> 01:43:01,135
<i>I'd been standing just outside the
emergency room at the hospital</i>

1225
01:43:01,137 --> 01:43:04,172
<i>when the doctor walked out</i>
<i>and faced me.</i>

1226
01:43:04,174 --> 01:43:07,008
<i>The doctor shook his head</i>
<i>and said softly,</i>

1227
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:09,243
<i>"We did everything we could."</i>

1228
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:13,381
<i>As I walked among them,</i>

1229
01:43:13,383 --> 01:43:16,651
<i>I became aware</i>
<i>of the wide variety of ages.</i>

1230
01:43:16,653 --> 01:43:20,488
<i>Old and young</i>
<i>and every age in between.</i>

1231
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:23,158
<i>Many of them hadn't known each</i>
<i>other on Earth,</i>

1232
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:27,361
<i>but each had influenced</i>
<i>my life in some way.</i>

1233
01:43:27,363 --> 01:43:30,031
<i>Even though they</i>
<i>hadn't met on Earth,</i>

1234
01:43:30,033 --> 01:43:33,267
<i>they seemed to know</i>
<i>each other now.</i>

1235
01:43:33,269 --> 01:43:36,170
<i>One person in the greeting</i>
<i>committee was Mike Wood,</i>

1236
01:43:36,172 --> 01:43:38,505
<i>my childhood friend.</i>

1237
01:43:38,507 --> 01:43:41,008
<i>He was a popular kid</i>
<i>and became a hero to me</i>

1238
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:46,013
<i>because he lived the Christian
lifestyle and often talked about it.</i>

1239
01:43:46,015 --> 01:43:51,617
<i>After high school, Mike received a full
scholarship to Louisiana State University.</i>

1240
01:43:51,619 --> 01:43:56,021
<i>When he was 19,</i>
<i>Mike was killed in a car wreck.</i>

1241
01:43:56,023 --> 01:44:00,559
<i>When I attended his funeral, I
wondered if I would ever stop crying.</i>

1242
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:05,530
<i>I couldn't understand why God had
taken such a dedicated disciple.</i>

1243
01:44:05,532 --> 01:44:11,203
<i>Through the years since then, I had never been
able to forget that pain and sense of loss.</i>

1244
01:44:11,205 --> 01:44:13,972
<i>Then I saw Barry Wilson,</i>

1245
01:44:13,974 --> 01:44:17,676
<i>who had been classmate in high
school, but later drowned in a lake.</i>

1246
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:23,781
<i>Barry's smile radiated a happiness
I didn't know was possible.</i>

1247
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:29,787
<i>And I saw my great-grandmother</i>
<i>Hattie Mann.</i>

1248
01:44:29,789 --> 01:44:33,825
<i>As a child, I knew her only after
she had developed osteoporosis.</i>

1249
01:44:33,827 --> 01:44:36,561
<i>Her head and her shoulders</i>
<i>were always bent forward,</i>

1250
01:44:36,563 --> 01:44:39,798
<i>giving her a...</i>
<i>a sort of humped appearance.</i>

1251
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:45,470
<i>But the beautiful thing is, she
didn't carry these burdens in heaven.</i>

1252
01:44:45,472 --> 01:44:49,241
<i>Heaven was many things,</i>
<i>but without a doubt,</i>

1253
01:44:49,243 --> 01:44:53,145
<i>it was the greatest</i>
<i>family reunion of all.</i>

1254
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:00,819
<i>A holy awe came over me</i>
<i>as I stepped forward.</i>

1255
01:45:01,821 --> 01:45:04,089
<i>I had no idea what lay ahead.</i>

1256
01:45:04,091 --> 01:45:08,226
<i>But I sensed that with each step I
took, it would grow more wondrous.</i>

1257
01:45:09,862 --> 01:45:12,430
<i>Then I heard the music.</i>

1258
01:45:12,432 --> 01:45:16,668
<i>I can only describe it</i>
<i>as a holy swoosh of wings.</i>

1259
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:19,137
<i>But I'd have to magnify that</i>
<i>thousands of times</i>

1260
01:45:19,139 --> 01:45:22,441
<i>to explain the effect</i>
<i>of the sound in heaven.</i>

1261
01:45:22,443 --> 01:45:26,711
<i>It was the most beautiful and</i>
<i>pleasant sound I'd ever heard.</i>

1262
01:45:28,181 --> 01:45:30,782
<i>I saw a bright iridescence.</i>

1263
01:45:30,784 --> 01:45:35,020
<i>I peered through the gate,</i>
<i>yearning to see what lay beyond.</i>

1264
01:45:35,022 --> 01:45:37,322
<i>It wasn't an anxious</i>
<i>yearning, but,</i>

1265
01:45:37,324 --> 01:45:39,324
<i>uh, a peaceful openness</i>

1266
01:45:39,326 --> 01:45:43,895
<i>to experience all of the
grace and joy of heaven.</i>

1267
01:45:43,897 --> 01:45:49,000
<i>At that very moment I was about to realize
the yearning of every human heart.</i>

1268
01:45:49,002 --> 01:45:53,705
<i>I was in heaven and ready to go
through the pearlescent gates.</i>

1269
01:45:57,042 --> 01:46:01,812
<i>Then, just as suddenly as I'd arrived
at the gates of heaven, I left there.</i>

1270
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,517
I spent a lot of time
in the hospital

1271
01:46:06,519 --> 01:46:09,988
trying to make sense
of all of this.

1272
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:14,725
I was paralyzed by the notion
of not wanting to return.

1273
01:46:14,727 --> 01:46:16,929
I mean, why come back
to this much pain?

1274
01:46:21,867 --> 01:46:23,733
I think now I know.

1275
01:46:25,702 --> 01:46:27,904
I do too.

1276
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:35,276
I believe it's time for me
to go back to church.

1277
01:46:37,412 --> 01:46:39,446
I believe that too.

1278
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:44,917
Have you told anyone else
about this?

1279
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:52,625
Yes. David.

1280
01:46:54,527 --> 01:46:56,828
Are you hurt that I
didn't tell you first?

1281
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,633
No.

1282
01:47:03,736 --> 01:47:06,704
I feel elated to know,

1283
01:47:06,706 --> 01:47:10,775
because it enables me to understand
the man to whom I'm married.

1284
01:47:14,212 --> 01:47:16,980
- Eva.
- Yes?

1285
01:47:19,216 --> 01:47:20,816
Eva.

1286
01:47:20,818 --> 01:47:26,322
No one should have to do the
things that you had to do for me.

1287
01:47:26,324 --> 01:47:28,792
But you did them,

1288
01:47:28,794 --> 01:47:31,895
faithfully, compassionately
and without hesitation.

1289
01:47:38,969 --> 01:47:43,106
You come closest to really
knowing how painful

1290
01:47:43,108 --> 01:47:45,307
this journey has been for me.

1291
01:47:47,411 --> 01:47:51,748
Each day you endured it with me.

1292
01:47:58,322 --> 01:48:02,325
Eva, you are my gift from God.

1293
01:48:13,272 --> 01:48:17,876
<i>I was so enthusiastic about
finally returning to South Park.</i>

1294
01:48:17,878 --> 01:48:21,145
<i>I hadn't been out of bed for</i>
<i>more than an hour at a time and,</i>

1295
01:48:21,147 --> 01:48:25,550
<i>well, I overestimated my endurance and
suddenly felt incredibly fatigued.</i>

1296
01:48:27,787 --> 01:48:32,624
<i>Yet, the... the overwhelming response
from the congregation gave me</i>

1297
01:48:32,626 --> 01:48:34,393
<i>a new burst of strength,</i>

1298
01:48:34,395 --> 01:48:38,663
<i>and I knew right then that their praise
was for God's work and my healing.</i>

1299
01:48:38,665 --> 01:48:44,169
It's only taken me...
five months

1300
01:48:44,171 --> 01:48:47,373
to get from the conference at
Trinity Pines back to church?

1301
01:48:50,143 --> 01:48:53,746
I may be slow, but I'm faithful.

1302
01:49:00,021 --> 01:49:03,088
They would like for you to say
something to the congregation.

1303
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:05,991
Eva, I think I made a mistake.
I don't think I can do this.

1304
01:49:05,993 --> 01:49:08,059
You can.
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

1305
01:49:08,061 --> 01:49:10,128
You are.

1306
01:49:16,769 --> 01:49:19,604
Let's hear it, Don.

1307
01:49:19,606 --> 01:49:23,075
Say something, Don, please.

1308
01:49:58,216 --> 01:49:59,816
You prayed.

1309
01:50:03,954 --> 01:50:06,121
I'm here.

1310
01:50:19,402 --> 01:50:21,403
Oh, there he is. Hey, Don!

1311
01:50:21,405 --> 01:50:23,139
Don!

1312
01:50:24,441 --> 01:50:28,611
Hey! You made it. Yeah.

1313
01:50:28,613 --> 01:50:31,180
It's so good to see you.

1314
01:50:31,182 --> 01:50:35,919
I believe that I'm alive today
because you prayed me back to Earth.

1315
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:38,521
Tell you what. You buy me
lunch, we'll call it even.

1316
01:50:38,523 --> 01:50:40,257
All right, it's a deal.

1317
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:41,191
That's right.

1318
01:50:42,326 --> 01:50:44,160
I couldn't figure out
how to get inside,

1319
01:50:44,162 --> 01:50:46,796
so I just pried open the trunk,

1320
01:50:46,798 --> 01:50:49,465
knocked down the backseat
and crawled in that way.

1321
01:50:49,467 --> 01:50:52,168
But even when I was praying with
you, I didn't know it was you.

1322
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:55,337
Besides, no one lives through that.
Hmm.

1323
01:50:55,339 --> 01:51:00,742
Well, in my first moments of
consciousness, two things stand out.

1324
01:51:01,944 --> 01:51:07,115
First, I was singing.

1325
01:51:07,117 --> 01:51:10,285
I don't sing. No.

1326
01:51:10,287 --> 01:51:13,321
"What a Friend
We Have in Jesus."

1327
01:51:13,323 --> 01:51:16,858
And the second was that Dick had
climbed into the car with me,

1328
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:20,994
and... and his hand had gripped
mine and held it tight.

1329
01:51:20,996 --> 01:51:23,797
But the one thing
that is absolutely clear

1330
01:51:23,799 --> 01:51:26,299
was Dick being in the car
and praying with me.

1331
01:51:26,301 --> 01:51:31,004
That's true. He did get in
the car and prayed with you.

1332
01:51:31,006 --> 01:51:34,141
But, Don,
he never held your hand.

1333
01:51:37,912 --> 01:51:41,015
- Nope.
- I-I remember it so clearly though.

1334
01:51:41,017 --> 01:51:45,987
It was one of the most
vivid details.

1335
01:51:45,989 --> 01:51:50,191
- It didn't happen.
- It was physically impossible.

1336
01:51:50,193 --> 01:51:54,829
There's just no physical way possible
I could have reached your right hand.

1337
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:01,268
But...

1338
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:03,236
But I-I-I swear, I...

1339
01:52:03,238 --> 01:52:05,606
Someone was holding your hand.

1340
01:52:06,507 --> 01:52:09,175
But it wasn't Dick.

1341
01:52:09,177 --> 01:52:14,414
<i>Dick Onerecker was a real prayer
warrior before and after the accident.</i>

1342
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:18,685
<i>He would pass away only a few years
after praying for me on that bridge.</i>

1343
01:52:27,128 --> 01:52:29,163
Okay, you guys, right in here.

1344
01:52:48,552 --> 01:52:51,220
- Hey, darlin'.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm?

1345
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:53,156
I'll be right back. Okay.

1346
01:53:11,744 --> 01:53:15,179
Boy, that really hurts,
doesn't it?

1347
01:53:15,181 --> 01:53:19,083
Yeah, it hurts very much.
Yeah, I know.

1348
01:53:22,755 --> 01:53:27,625
Believe me, I know. You do?

1349
01:53:27,627 --> 01:53:30,327
Yeah. I had one too.

1350
01:53:34,099 --> 01:53:35,766
It's horrible.

1351
01:53:35,768 --> 01:53:38,602
Ah, it's... it's just horrible.

1352
01:53:38,604 --> 01:53:41,772
It's awful. I know that.

1353
01:53:41,774 --> 01:53:45,275
I wore one on my left leg
for 11 months.

1354
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:48,312
Nobody ever understands.
Well, they can't.

1355
01:53:48,314 --> 01:53:53,116
It's not something you can talk about
and have anyone understand your pain.

1356
01:53:54,818 --> 01:53:56,852
I'm Don. Mark.

1357
01:53:57,788 --> 01:53:59,722
Well, Mark,

1358
01:53:59,724 --> 01:54:03,693
you just met someone
who does understand the pain

1359
01:54:03,695 --> 01:54:08,196
and the discouragement
you're going through.

1360
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:13,935
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
Oh, you'll make it.

1361
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:17,405
You're gonna make it. Hey.

1362
01:54:17,407 --> 01:54:20,307
Hey, trust me. You'll make it.

1363
01:54:23,345 --> 01:54:25,679
What happened?

1364
01:54:25,681 --> 01:54:27,815
I had a skiing accident.

1365
01:54:30,552 --> 01:54:33,988
- You're a football player?
- Yes, sir.

1366
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:37,824
I'm gonna tell you something.

1367
01:54:37,826 --> 01:54:42,862
One day, you will walk again.

1368
01:54:42,864 --> 01:54:46,106
Might not be playing
football, but you'll walk.

1369
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,201
Here's my card.
Number's right there.

1370
01:54:49,203 --> 01:54:52,972
You can call me anytime, day or
night, 24 hours a day. All right?

1371
01:54:56,109 --> 01:55:00,546
Now, I'm gonna walk back
over there to my family.

1372
01:55:00,548 --> 01:55:03,416
I want you to watch me,

1373
01:55:03,418 --> 01:55:07,953
and as you watch, I want you to do
know that one day you will walk too.

1374
01:55:12,959 --> 01:55:15,160
You'll probably do it
better than I do.

1375
01:55:18,532 --> 01:55:22,935
You met someone who understands.
Give me a call, all right?

1376
01:55:22,937 --> 01:55:26,438
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1377
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:30,309
Hey, it's not about me.

1378
01:55:30,311 --> 01:55:35,648
<i>Before I died on that bridge, I was
unsure of what my purpose was.</i>

1379
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:37,916
<i>Now I see it more clearly.</i>

1380
01:55:37,918 --> 01:55:40,653
<i>Ministering and sharing</i>
<i>the hope I found.</i>

1381
01:56:06,915 --> 01:56:11,584
Over 25 years ago,
that big truck

1382
01:56:11,586 --> 01:56:15,688
took my life
on that old bridge.

1383
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:21,159
I am not the man I used to be.

1384
01:56:21,161 --> 01:56:26,998
I have been beaten up,
but I'm not beaten.

1385
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,503
I have chosen to be

1386
01:56:31,505 --> 01:56:34,507
not bitter, but better.

1387
01:56:34,509 --> 01:56:38,043
And it<i> is</i> a choice.

1388
01:56:39,212 --> 01:56:43,315
Every day of my life,
I still ask the same question

1389
01:56:43,317 --> 01:56:48,354
that I asked in that bed,
that hospital bed, every day.

1390
01:56:49,622 --> 01:56:52,691
Oh, Lord, why?

1391
01:56:52,693 --> 01:56:58,030
Why did you let me see heaven
and take it away from me?

1392
01:57:01,134 --> 01:57:06,805
I believe it is so that
I could be here with<i> you</i> today

1393
01:57:06,807 --> 01:57:09,307
and tell you to your face,

1394
01:57:11,643 --> 01:57:15,880
God still answers prayer.

1395
01:57:15,882 --> 01:57:19,483
God is still in
the miracle business today.

1396
01:57:19,485 --> 01:57:25,022
God is able to help us
find a new normal

1397
01:57:25,024 --> 01:57:29,493
and overcome tragedy and loss,
pain and suffering.

1398
01:57:31,896 --> 01:57:35,832
And God is building us
a better place.

1399
01:57:35,834 --> 01:57:39,269
Heaven is real.

1400
01:57:42,006 --> 01:57:46,610
I may not meet you here,
this side of heaven.

1401
01:57:48,679 --> 01:57:52,015
So my prayer for you today is,

1402
01:57:52,017 --> 01:57:56,252
if I don't meet you<i> here,</i>
one day,

1403
01:57:56,254 --> 01:58:01,357
I want to see you<i> there</i>
at the gates.

1404
01:58:03,728 --> 01:58:05,762
And may God help us

1405
01:58:05,764 --> 01:58:09,933
to be found faithful
until that day.
