1
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,338
Uh, you little fucking

2
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,506
- Go, go!
- Dickheads!

3
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,156
You think you're stronger than
me?

4
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,692
I'll eat your fucking face off!

5
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,061
Where's your brother? Where's
that shit?

6
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,097
Come on, come on, come on.

7
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,408
Fucking shit! You little shit,
I'll...

8
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,261
Woo!

9
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,134
You wanna hurry up?

10
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,537
You've been throwing half
shovel fulls all goddamn day!

11
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,471
Sick of it!

12
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,494
Dad's?

13
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,768
Probably looking for it now.

14
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,669
Where are we gonna go, Henry?

15
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,505
Far away from here.

16
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,075
How much money you got?

17
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,209
Not much.

18
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,711
I still gotta stop at Mr.
Barrow's

19
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,712
and get my pay.

20
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,716
We're gonna need all we can get.

21
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,489
- Hey. Mr. Barrow, it's me.
Jacob.

22
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,992
Jacob, how are you, son?

23
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,662
I'm good.

24
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,599
I was just wondering if I
could get my pay for last week.

25
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,834
Yes, of course. Come on up.

26
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,240
I wanna tell you boys a little
more

27
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,709
about the Battle of Khe Sanh.

28
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,446
One of the most important
battles of the entire Vietnam war,

29
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,315
if not in fact, the longest and
bloodiest.

30
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:14,087
6,000 Marines and their
garrison were held under siege

31
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,822
by the North Vietnamese Army.

32
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:21,928
And on January 21st, 1968,
shooting-

33
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,297
- I, I'm Sorry, Mr. Barrow,
- and...

34
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,066
but we really need to be going.

35
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,001
Can I please get my pay?

36
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,471
Sure can. My wallet's
on the kitchen table.

37
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,740
Thank you.

38
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,251
Thank you, Mr. Barrow.

39
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:49,689
Say boys, did you happen to see

40
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,193
the military transport up on the
hill?

41
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,995
I haven't heard one
like that in these parts

42
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,430
for some while, you know.

43
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,068
Peculiar sound, that vehicle.

44
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,874
And Miss Sally told me
it's heading way out north

45
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,910
to Pithole, I suppose.

46
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:16,950
Pithole, you said. Are you
sure about that, Mr. Barrow?

47
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,376
I just wanted to enjoy the
summer.

48
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,845
Hang by the Creek.

49
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,680
We're finally free.

50
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,815
This is more important.

51
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:56,816
Come on, Henry.

52
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,951
He's an old blind man.

53
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,186
Who even knows if it's true.

54
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,454
It's worth looking. It's Mom.

55
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,456
I know that, but we
don't even know where.

56
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,293
You heard Mr. Barrow. She's
there.

57
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,962
We're going.
- She left us.

58
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,396
Remember?

59
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,932
She didn't want us, so I don't
want her.

60
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:16,502
So what would you
rather, go back to Daddy?

61
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,139
Get beat so bad this time it
don't heal?

62
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:23,143
Keep mowing grass, picking
weeds and shoveling asphalt?

63
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,111
I'm done with all that.

64
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,447
This is our only shot.

65
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,116
Weren't things better when mom
was around?

66
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,319
She just didn't see it.

67
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,921
She'll come back.
- And what if she doesn't?

68
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:35,822
She will.

69
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,326
This is no time to be scared,
Jacob.

70
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,729
I'm not scared.

71
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,596
Well good.

72
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,502
Listen, we need a better life.

73
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,473
We deserve a better life
with Mom. That can happen.

74
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,379
We know where she is for the
first time.

75
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,913
And we've got no one else.

76
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:32,045
Okay, if we're gonna do
this, we've got to be prepared.

77
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,183
We've got our backpacks,

78
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,918
but we've got to get creative
and find more supplies.

79
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,791
I have some ideas.

80
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,061
Yeah, I don't now. He
didn't show up for work today.

81
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,830
I don't know what we're gonna
do.

82
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,235
So there I was in
the middle of the camp.

83
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,836
The helicopter camp just outside
Pleiku.

84
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,808
A little after midnight,
February 7th, 1964.

85
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,183
Sorry, but, uh, thanks.

86
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,385
I always love hearing those war
stories.

87
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,653
No problem, boys.

88
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,589
Enjoy the soup and beans.

89
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,768
Okay.

90
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,673
So we're here and Mom
is all the way up here.

91
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:44,278
It's a hard journey, but
it's definitely doable.

92
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:48,549
So we'll enter at the viaduct,
then move on to the boulders,

93
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,918
then the lake, then the
pines, and then Mom.

94
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,557
We should get there in a
few days if we're lucky.

95
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,321
W-what is it?

96
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:23,956
Dead people.

97
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,097
Looks like sacred land,

98
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,866
so don't touch or step on
anything.

99
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:06,166
Hey! Let's go.

100
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:08,802
Hey, wait up.

101
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,472
Whatever happened to Becky
Lawson?

102
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:02,342
What do you
mean, what happened to her?

103
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,612
I dumped her.

104
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,248
She was hooking up with Tommy
Briggs.

105
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,282
The hockey player?

106
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:14,054
Yeah, the hockey player.

107
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,905
Did you guys, you know, do it?

108
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,242
You're an idiot.

109
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:37,109
What?

110
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,258
Henry. Hey.

111
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:14,128
- Mm.
- What,

112
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:16,095
what's with your neck?

113
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,932
What do you mean, what's with
my neck?

114
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,301
It's not right.

115
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:24,003
Ah! Shit!

116
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,473
Hand me the gauze.

117
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:33,853
Yeah, you're just like
your fucking whore brother.

118
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,063
Look at me!

119
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,251
You ever see that before?

120
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,420
It's probably just
some kids messing around.

121
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,343
You want some?

122
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:03,397
Are you okay?

123
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,202
I can help with that bandage, if
you want.

124
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:10,069
Mm-mm.

125
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:41,388
Jacob.

126
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:44,558
Wait. Wait.

127
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:46,193
Wait.

128
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:04,644
No, no!

129
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:06,880
Henry? Henry!

130
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:08,748
Henry.

131
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:12,719
Henry.

132
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,388
Come on. Let's go.

133
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:18,592
Come on.

134
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,427
Henry, hey, its gonna be, it's
okay.

135
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,229
You're okay. Come on.

136
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:24,297
Easy, come on.

137
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,365
Hey, your neck looks pretty bad.

138
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,435
Maybe we should go get it
checked out.

139
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:39,506
We can always take a road to
town.

140
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:57,390
Hey Henry, you doing all right?

141
00:40:58,425 --> 00:40:59,259
Henry?

142
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:05,332
Henry? Hello?

143
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,401
If you wanna ignore me, fine.

144
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:11,004
This is your stupid
idea. Just remember that.

145
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:15,041
I just wanted to hang by
the creek this summer.

146
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,576
Is that too much to ask for?

147
00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:19,412
Hey, are you gonna answer me?

148
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:20,847
What's your problem, man?

149
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:51,911
Henry!

150
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:54,748
Henry!

151
00:41:56,549 --> 00:41:57,350
Henry!

152
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:00,687
Henry!

153
00:42:57,877 --> 00:42:59,979
Jacob!

154
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:01,514
Jacob!

155
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:02,515
Are you okay?

156
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:04,151
Jacob!

157
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:05,018
Jacob!

158
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:12,525
I told you not to mess with
anything!

159
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,561
What did you do?

160
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:19,133
Fuck!

161
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:23,036
Come on.

162
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:29,876
Come on, buddy. Come on.

163
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:32,078
You can make it. You can make
it, Jacob.

164
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:34,748
Come on. You're gonna walk.

165
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,015
Come on, Jacob.

166
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:49,529
It's gonna be okay, Jacob.

167
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:52,332
It's gonna be okay. I've got
you.

168
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:54,734
I've got you. You're gonna be
okay.

169
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:57,138
You're gonna be okay. It's
Henry, buddy.

170
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,472
It's Henry. Henry's got you.

171
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:02,143
I've got you. You're gonna be
okay.

172
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:04,711
Come here. You're gonna be okay.

173
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:07,347
You're gonna be okay. I got ya.

174
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:22,629
The blood of the male.

175
00:44:24,964 --> 00:44:27,534
The blood of the male.

176
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:31,771
The blood of the male.

177
00:44:34,774 --> 00:44:36,609
The blood of the male.

178
00:44:39,312 --> 00:44:41,148
The blood of the male.

179
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:45,819
The blood of the male.

180
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:18,017
The blood of the male.

181
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:29,996
The blood of the male.

182
00:45:54,288 --> 00:45:56,522
The blood of the young man.

183
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:30,550
Hey, you, ah...

184
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:31,884
You doing all right?

185
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:34,288
Yeah, I think so.

186
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:40,560
I think my neck is almost
healed.

187
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:41,428
That's good.

188
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:47,434
We don't have to keep going.

189
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:48,768
Given all that's happened.

190
00:47:49,669 --> 00:47:51,171
It might be time to head back.

191
00:47:53,506 --> 00:47:55,041
Really?

192
00:47:55,074 --> 00:47:56,809
Yeah, sure.

193
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,913
I just thought...

194
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:02,615
What?

195
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:06,986
Nah, forget it.

196
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:08,788
What?

197
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:16,829
I just thought that if Mom saw
us,

198
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:18,798
it would make a difference.

199
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:22,169
Maybe she would miss us or
remember us

200
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:24,837
or something, I don't know.

201
00:48:28,975 --> 00:48:30,043
Let's keep going.

202
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:32,346
Yeah?

203
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:34,481
Yeah.

204
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:37,484
We don't have to, you know.

205
00:48:40,154 --> 00:48:41,155
I want to.

206
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:46,005
- Mom?
- Mom?

207
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:51,345
Come with me.

208
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:00,786
What are you doing
here? You can't be here.

209
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,322
It's not safe.

210
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:03,856
We came for you, Mom.

211
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,225
We want you to come home.

212
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:11,030
Oh, my boys. I can't come home.

213
00:52:11,063 --> 00:52:12,399
I'm sorry.

214
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,534
Why not? Why don't you love us?

215
00:52:15,535 --> 00:52:17,204
What did we do?

216
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:19,839
Listen to me. He can't see you.

217
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:21,241
You have no idea the danger
you're in.

218
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:22,309
You need to go.
- What are you

219
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:23,577
talking about, Mom?
- Go, go.

220
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,077
- Mom, wait a minute.
- No, listen.

221
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:26,680
- Mom, slow down.
- Go, go.

222
00:52:26,713 --> 00:52:28,948
- Mom, there's something...
- Go and don't look back.

223
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,116
Just go.
- No, Mom-

224
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,983
- Go!

225
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:43,597
Hey, they didn't take
your knife, did they?

226
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,265
No, it, it's in this pocket.

227
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:50,437
Got it. Got it.

228
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:02,416
We can't just leave.
We've come all this way.

229
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:05,084
I know. We have to get her
alone.

230
00:53:05,117 --> 00:53:06,386
I know, but how?

231
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,623
We can wait until they're
asleep.

232
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,873
Welcome.

233
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,823
The blood of the young male is
pure.

234
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:51,998
It has special rehabilitative
properties.

235
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,335
We lust for youth,

236
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,838
and youth we shall receive.

237
00:59:00,473 --> 00:59:01,608
Longevity.

238
00:59:03,777 --> 00:59:04,811
Vitality.

239
00:59:06,479 --> 00:59:07,847
And you could give it to me.

240
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,620
Some people, well,

241
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:15,388
they would say that I'm
stealing.

242
00:59:18,024 --> 00:59:18,858
But I'm not.

243
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,695
It's not personal.

244
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:26,366
No. It's just necessary.

245
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:47,587
These are made out of wood.

246
00:59:49,055 --> 00:59:50,191
Very strong wood.

247
00:59:51,524 --> 00:59:53,893
I'm gonna take this
and I'm gonna pierce it

248
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:54,861
into your heart.

249
00:59:56,496 --> 00:59:57,697
You won't feel anything.

250
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:00,066
Don't be afraid.

251
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:03,369
You're not the first

252
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:05,972
and you certainly won't be the
last.

253
01:00:22,822 --> 01:00:23,623
Yeah.

254
01:00:25,024 --> 01:00:28,795
Ah.

255
01:00:32,532 --> 01:00:35,068
I sacrifice onto the!

256
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,243
Ah!

257
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:42,629
You boys may not know
it, but you saved me.

258
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,797
You saved us.

259
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:48,868
We want you to come with us,
Mom.

260
01:07:50,304 --> 01:07:53,140
I will, in time.

261
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,211
These people need me. I
recruited them.

262
01:07:58,545 --> 01:08:00,514
I need to make this right

263
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:02,782
with them and with you.

264
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:06,653
- Mom, please.
- I love you boys.

265
01:08:06,687 --> 01:08:08,355
I love you very much.

266
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:11,991
And I promise, I will explain
everything to you in time,

267
01:08:13,793 --> 01:08:17,631
but for now I need you
to go and make me proud.

268
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:20,032
And I will see you again
when our paths cross.

269
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:22,669
I love you, Henry.

270
01:08:23,537 --> 01:08:25,104
I love you, Jacob.

271
01:09:31,837 --> 01:09:34,040
You know, I'm glad we went.

272
01:09:34,073 --> 01:09:35,875
I'm not so sure.

273
01:09:35,908 --> 01:09:36,909
Why?

274
01:09:36,942 --> 01:09:40,447
Well, maybe you were right.

275
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,382
Maybe we should have let it be.

276
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,718
I'm sorry I pushed you so hard.

277
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:47,387
No, I'm glad we found out.

278
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:48,689
Found out what?

279
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:51,291
That moms still loves us.

280
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:56,630
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

281
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,502
- Hey, Henry?
- Yeah.

282
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:04,937
You think we can
hang out by the creek now?

283
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,006
Yeah, I think
that's a great idea.

284
01:10:11,877 --> 01:10:13,079
You know, maybe I can get you

285
01:10:13,112 --> 01:10:14,481
a job with Mr. Barrow.

286
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:17,584
He ain't so bad.
- Yeah, maybe.
