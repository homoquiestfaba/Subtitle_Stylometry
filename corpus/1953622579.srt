1
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,531
Have you ever dreamed of a
before you met him?

2
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:40,498
As you invented it but did not.

3
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,879
These things really happen.

4
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,507
Weird, incredible things.

5
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:54,845
I can swear that happen all
the time.

6
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,578
Wake up.

7
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,707
Get up.

8
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,003
Is it raining?

9
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,214
Sort of.

10
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:33,050
I thought this park.

11
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:35,094
But at night, looks like
a park.

12
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:01,245
And we were in Italy,
we would be Italian?

13
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,166
A could be the French who
live in Italy.

14
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,586
We enjoy the food and way
of life.

15
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,715
Yes, but now we're in someone's backyard
and I'm starving, so, hurry up.

16
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:17,887
We are French women who die
of hunger.

17
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:21,974
Shit.

18
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,894
You parked on my lawn.

19
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,729
Yes, it's really nice.

20
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,522
It is better to remove.

21
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,774
No problem.

22
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,652
It is better to immediately
remove.

23
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,447
I told you, all right!

24
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,660
I'm sorry for your lawn.

25
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,871
What did you say?

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,377
I've always loved to travel.

27
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,841
Manny & Lo
- Meninas de Ninguém -

28
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,699
The day when our mother died,

29
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:05,327
Lo hid behind ðubrišta car,
just in case.

30
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,664
That summer, she ran away
from her adoptive

31
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,041
and somehow I was kidnapped
from my own.

32
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,298
She said it was her job to
save me from

33
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,009
such families as the Gordons.

34
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,136
I did not think it was so bad,

35
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,389
except that I was forced
to sleep in the garage.

36
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,852
But I'd still rather be with Lo.

37
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,815
She's my sister, but a good man.

38
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,291
Will?

39
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,132
Do You Know What's this for?

40
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,802
Thank you.

41
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,228
It seems that is not the owner.
That's what I thought.

42
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:26,825
Lo, this is true of horses.
Really? Really.

43
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,786
Go check milk.

44
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,939
Lo says that there are familial types
of people, and those who are not.

45
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,776
It's no good to you if
you're wrong.

46
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,411
She said that since our mother
had was majèinski type,

47
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,039
it means that she and I are
naturally independent.

48
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,547
Therefore, it is planned to
become a flight attendant.

49
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,384
And how are you today? - Good.

50
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,512
Would you like something
to drink, gentlemen? Of course.

51
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,765
Luckily she had a natural gift
for turbulence.

52
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,311
How about you girls?
- Move.

53
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,772
What? - I have cramps.

54
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,275
Have already? - Lo, down.

55
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,361
All right.

56
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,260
Can I ask you something, I?
When are you going to grows out this?

57
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,931
We're out. We need to get some
more tomorrow.

58
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:16,894
In the car we Rajkar.
She did not smell of Rajkar.

59
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:21,440
Yes, you're right, it's not, and you
know why, because it smelled like.

60
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,906
What's wrong with you?

61
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,341
Will you take my side?

62
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:52,555
Really? - Just tonight.

63
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:16,162
Some things, or you notice it
or not.

64
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:22,585
As eyelashes, Lo tried without
anyone noticing.

65
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,630
What are you looking at?

66
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,175
It's nothing.

67
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:37,433
So we have persisted for so long.
We were just two girls passing by.

68
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,188
If you have a car that no one knows,
and you know to borrow petrol

69
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,024
with the help of hose, you
quite some time to travel.

70
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,775
Hey, Joey.

71
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,332
We just stuck with one rule.

72
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,668
Always on the move and will
not get caught.

73
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,775
Thank you.

74
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,861
I did not do it for you.

75
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:37,201
I know, but thank you anyway.

76
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:44,500
I got something for you.

77
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,431
What's this? It's a gift
for you.

78
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,767
Seriously?

79
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,894
Open.

80
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,319
What's this?

81
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,322
That's the blues. Try it.

82
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,408
Why?

83
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,997
I do not know, I wanted to see
how it looks.

84
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,249
And how do you think it fits?

85
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,085
Probably different.

86
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:30,629
I mean, it's nice.

87
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,548
Fuck you, Joey.

88
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,175
Why?

89
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,552
Why?

90
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,679
I did not mean anything by it.

91
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,472
Let me, let's go.

92
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,727
Wait, where are you going, I'll buy
you another one, with a different pattern,

93
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,731
drugaèe blouse, where are
you going? I love you.

94
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,112
Hurry up, I want you to practice.

95
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,074
We have a new tray.

96
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,954
I did not do that tonight. Why?

97
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,166
I do not know. Why?

98
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:15,132
Because you're too...
- Too what?

99
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,928
Are you saying I'm fat?

100
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,763
Lo're not fat, but...

101
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,224
Okay, I'm fat, ok, I admit,

102
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,852
It's not so much a surprise.

103
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,980
Read this.

104
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,608
What? - This.

105
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:45,663
Mix eggs, sugar, oil, corn syrup...
- This is eating every day.

106
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:56,799
The thing is, you can lose
weight whenever I want,

107
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,677
You just need the will, right?

108
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,596
And who has more will than me?

109
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,934
No Lo. That's right.

110
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,810
Shit.

111
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,201
Susie. - Yes.

112
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,581
You have not been here by now,
right?

113
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,583
No, this is my first time.

114
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,710
So how is it?

115
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,254
Brilliant. - Good.

116
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,636
You do not need to test my urine.
 I know what it is.

117
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,847
Deal.
- I am pregnant.

118
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,142
Are.

119
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,395
That's why I'm here, to take
care of it.

120
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,732
What do you think?

121
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,487
If sin will come to know when I die,
but now I do not have a choice.

122
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,447
As I said, I'm pregnant.

123
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,867
And you are long gone when you
could have something to do.

124
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,371
You can give birth tomorrow.

125
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,958
Will you do what I ask or not?

126
00:13:56,418 --> 00:14:00,756
Sit down to talk.

127
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,468
You and he have a lot to
catch up on.

128
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,848
I'm not here to talk.

129
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,037
You know what we need? What?

130
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,249
Something in the countryside.

131
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,211
Where can we keep before us
the hope.

132
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:44,800
And not only so we wander, we
need some stability, is not it?

133
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,178
Sure.

134
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,389
While not complete, and then
continue.

135
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,226
In which direction to go?

136
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,062
I think that way.

137
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,981
Sounds good.

138
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,336
What if your mom here and tell
her about the baby?

139
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,713
Since we, as a ghost?

140
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,467
No, I think she's still alive.

141
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,136
To sit in the back seat.

142
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,597
I normally talk to us.

143
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,851
What would you do? Depends
whether drunk or high.

144
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,312
Come on, Lo.

145
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,773
How would I know what to do, Me.

146
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,234
Why do you always ask stupid
questions.

147
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,197
You probably would have had
a bath.

148
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,285
Yeah, probably.

149
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,670
How We've been on this trip?

150
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,133
Thirteen minutes and 40 seconds.

151
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,594
And when we passed the last
house?

152
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,097
That time. - Surely you see the
mailbox for the mail?

153
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,140
Sure.

154
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,270
Some people privacy seriously.

155
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,899
Wait a minute.

156
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,215
What if there's anyone?
- What are we going to tell them?

157
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,384
To sell biscuits.

158
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,888
What? Èokoladne?
Just go.

159
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,944
Is there anyone?

160
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,868
It is not locked.

161
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,340
You know, I think people live
here.

162
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,426
But do not currently live.
This is the second homes.

163
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,137
There will be vraæati some time.

164
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,847
How do you know?

165
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,767
See skis? - Yes.

166
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,645
Can you see the snow?

167
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,483
There is no food in the fridge.

168
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,113
And a bunch of cans. Food for
the winter.

169
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,618
Go check it out beds.

170
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:43,664
Tomorrow we have to get some
things that we need.
- What?

171
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,795
As the book. We must begin
to impart.

172
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:56,719
I saw the cat work on. Nine maèiæa
for eight and a half minutes.

173
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:02,224
Not hard to guess. Compared
with the other things we do.

174
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:15,821
They could at least introduce cable
here. See the tapes that they have.

175
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,498
"Orphan". - I was watching.

176
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,378
"In the service of love."
And that I saw.

177
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:41,514
A "Welcome Tiffany?"
- "Welcome Tiffany." I've never heard of.

178
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,141
I guess it's not bad.

179
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,871
This is Tiffany.

180
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,460
Look. See?

181
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,844
Lo? Lo?

182
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,976
Ugasiæu it.

183
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,452
This looks good.

184
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:50,124
There are a lot of pictures.
And drawings.

185
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:10,811
Check it out. Can you hear the baby
crying in the distance of 200 meters.

186
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,689
Try it.

187
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,617
Say something, will you?

188
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:35,336
There are three choices for each
Use of, or ordinary cloth diapers.

189
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,715
Of course, disposable ones are
most convenient,

190
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,427
but it breaks down, the canvas is
much better for the baby...

191
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,056
Come on. I said, let's go.

192
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,391
Just a second.

193
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:55,105
So if you want ordinary
diapers, we have,

194
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,235
and there is a kind of...

195
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,166
It's beautiful, is not it?

196
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:20,256
Unfortunately babies love to swing
right and not to the side.

197
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:30,307
I do not know why they were so right,
because if you make sure you can roll over the baby.

198
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:41,068
Honestly, if you like it buy
a rocking chair rocker.

199
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,945
Thank you.

200
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,040
Hello. - Hi. That's all? - Yes.

201
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,673
This is for your baby?
- Yes.

202
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,427
I think you'll also want a pink
pedal travel.

203
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,265
It's okay, it's better
this way.

204
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,351
Well, I never made a mistake.

205
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:19,356
Did you see someone that knows
so much about babies?

206
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:28,240
Excuse me, I'm Connie, this
is my store.

207
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,327
Alison. Hi Alison.

208
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,413
This is my Aunt Elaine,
who helps me when he can

209
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,166
and we are very grateful
to her.

210
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,712
Elaine, I think that Alison
wanted yellow.

211
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,800
How are you?

212
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,762
I'll be back in the morning,
Elaine.

213
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,436
You might ask her, right?

214
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,947
You think you can just take her?

215
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,032
So, always take things from
the store.

216
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:15,955
It's not funny. Do you want to go to
the hospital to arrest me or I die?

217
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,876
I do not want to get arrested
or to perish.

218
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:25,548
Okay, with that we have
already taken.

219
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,775
I'm sorry we're closed, you need to
you to come tomorrow. I can not.

220
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,779
Do you know what you need?

221
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,115
Yes. - All right then, come on.

222
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,788
How can I help? - Others need
my cradle.

223
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,960
We have two types of cribs, there
she was with stuffed animals

224
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,632
and here we have...
- Whoa, this is a rifle.

225
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,678
Put your hands in the air.
I'm serious, hands in the air.

226
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,972
Me, is greater.

227
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,693
Stop mumbling hell.

228
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,155
I mean it, do not spray it.

229
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,283
And legs.

230
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,625
Take the card.

231
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,009
Any.

232
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:59,475
Write to the sick and went to France...
No, do not write it.

233
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:08,400
Can... Dear friends I need
a break, like you Elaine.

234
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,862
Okay, come on.

235
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:37,721
If you think you'll take this
money, terribly wrong.

236
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,891
I do not need your money.

237
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,728
What do you need?

238
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,859
Let me, let's go.

239
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,621
Go see what he's doing,
I'll be careful.

240
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,881
Elaine...

241
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,396
I hope you slept well.

242
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,482
I'll let you music.

243
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,615
Some people like music while
you are sleeping.

244
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,746
Or when they are awake when they
are bored or neraspoložni.

245
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,712
My sister wanted to know if
you're okay.

246
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:58,469
Please tell your sister that I have
a lot of relatives and friends

247
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,597
with every day views.

248
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:05,976
No one will understand
my absence for granted.

249
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,731
I'm the one for you should
be worried.

250
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,150
Please pass on this.

251
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,488
Okay. - Thank you.

252
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,660
She is...
- I heard what she said.

253
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,578
Lo.

254
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:34,630
Elaine, hello. View Elaine.

255
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,384
I'm an alien.

256
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,974
Let Elaine, smile.

257
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,573
I still do not eat.

258
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,658
Take a spoon and feed it.

259
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,535
I've already tried that.

260
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,789
I think that the hunger strike.

261
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,375
What? Hunger-strike.

262
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,755
Lo? Lo.

263
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,469
There you go.

264
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,851
Do not discount the criminals,
regardless of whether a drug

265
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:35,107
or religious rituals, or whatever,
do not give up criminals.

266
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,154
Okay, then die.

267
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,949
I'm not going on holiday, ever.

268
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,536
It is generally known.

269
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,092
You have to sleep sometimes.

270
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,012
I can not believe I listened
to the rest.

271
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,265
I said I was sorry.
I did not know.

272
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,602
Go check the bathroom has
already been there.

273
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:09,827
Still she needs in 15 seconds.

274
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,872
How does that leaves
combination?

275
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,377
Around 22000

276
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,297
OK, check the twice daily.

277
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,382
All right.
That's your responsibility.

278
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,093
All right. - I'll tell me when it
is time to change the locks.

279
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,804
When it comes to the 15-20 may.

280
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,432
And do not let her see that
checking.

281
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,684
Let's not think that will work.

282
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,812
Give her the feeling that something
is achieved. It's okay.

283
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,857
So, are you going to relax
a bit.

284
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,651
Maybe he'll relax if you
talk to her.

285
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,778
You explain her situation.

286
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,822
First, let it cool down and
then I'll talk to her?

287
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,657
When you understand who's
the boss.

288
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,702
I think we should immediately
talk to her.

289
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,121
Well, you're the boss, right?

290
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,042
Is this yours?

291
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,461
Thank you.

292
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,022
You live here?

293
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:46,150
Yes, this is my room, this
is my fortress,

294
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:49,153
This is my bike there next room.

295
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,613
What is your name?

296
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,156
Do you?

297
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:55,367
Ben, but you can call me Even.

298
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:56,577
And why not Ben?

299
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,080
Nothing, I like it Even.

300
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,673
Take one.

301
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,345
Was signed.

302
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,353
I'm Tiffany.

303
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,563
Where do you live, Tiffany?

304
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,403
This is your mom? - Yes.

305
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,282
The real juice laid.

306
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:39,328
I said I was in that mood and
makes me such a shock.

307
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,121
It was weird.

308
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:45,751
What? Well I am currently so
in the mood.

309
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,546
Really? - Yes.

310
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,798
It was weird.

311
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:57,847
Maybe I can stay. They're coming
my relatives. - I like cousins.

312
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,475
Probably not enough.

313
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:10,901
I need to add some more things.
Will you come over tomorrow?

314
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:15,406
No it's fine. - Are you sure?
- Yes.

315
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:19,577
Whatever. Take care.

316
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,262
Where have you been? - Nowhere.

317
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,473
You did not talk to anybody,
right? - No.

318
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,728
You did not do anything stupid?
- No.

319
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,441
It is better not.

320
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:59,366
Let's get some food but I'll be
back sooner than you think,

321
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,660
so do not try anything.

322
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:06,207
There are no houses in the vicinity and
the road has at least five miles, is it me?

323
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,959
Four and a half.

324
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,839
And broken glass everywhere around
the house, I show her what you got.

325
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,935
There are all shoes that are in
the house. What else?

326
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,983
You also have things that can serve
as the shoes if you're really desperate.

327
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,946
Bucket on the floor if you need it.
Come on.

328
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:47,289
Now, if you want to stop a
hunger strike.

329
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,298
And if you want to listen
to music, and...

330
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:18,571
I do not know it seems like
a bad idea to me.

331
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:23,450
You're not gonna to keep the baby.
There's no way to keep the baby.

332
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,995
Then you have to choose
someone.

333
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:32,751
And that family on the ground?
They look ok.

334
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:36,338
Do you think they are ok.
I think you're sick.

335
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:38,048
What about them is wrong?

336
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:42,219
See how mother rocked her ass
every time the ball is hit.

337
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:45,890
Do you think these people you
can trust?

338
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,311
There are two or three mothers
out there that are not so bad

339
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,231
and if you will not already
choose to pick a bad one.

340
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,697
Shit.

341
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,803
Here Connie.

342
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,348
Is Elaine there?

343
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:29,475
Who is this? Barbara.

344
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,353
Who? Barbara, her friend.

345
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,813
Sorry Barbara, Elaine is not
here.

346
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:39,151
Really? Do you know where
it is?

347
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,320
She is on vacation.

348
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,324
Hello?

349
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,827
Do you know when will you
be back?

350
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:53,874
I do not know if you're her
new friend?

351
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,211
No. - Lf you were not in church?
- No.

352
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:01,674
Do you think you can hear her?

353
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:03,884
I do not know.

354
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:08,264
If you hear give her a message
from me, will you? Of course.

355
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:12,893
Tell her that this job has a
lot of financial cost

356
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,145
and that I am personally
responsible for them.

357
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:19,692
I can not afford to tell
people do unpredictable,

358
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,445
even relatives, not that I do not
have to understand it, and I have...

359
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,407
Get in the car.

360
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:31,495
How do you know that ozvuèen?
I know, because I was screwed, I know that.

361
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,373
Do not drive so zgnjeèiæeš baby.

362
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,593
Why we parked here?

363
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,970
Be quiet until you get to safety.

364
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,104
Shit.

365
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:02,067
Stop it.

366
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,701
God, you're pregnant.

367
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:14,288
Jesus, the porodiæeš.

368
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,458
Why do you think you're here?

369
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,637
Rodiæeš boy.

370
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,722
What?

371
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:36,477
I said it was a boy.
I have never made a mistake.

372
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:12,304
Why smoke when you're pregnant?

373
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,589
What do you think it is?

374
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:48,549
I have no idea.

375
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:53,929
It's called a hot meal and eating
it. Not for touching.

376
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:59,852
I think that kidnapping victims are
entitled to a meal like everyone else.

377
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:05,024
And if I'm not mistaken, the same
is true for the innocent babies.

378
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:11,113
If you two do not agree with it,
I can not help you.

379
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:33,844
It's good.

380
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:16,428
You know Connie?

381
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:17,930
My niece?

382
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:22,351
Yes. Why is not she wearing that
uniform for nurses like you?

383
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:27,606
Connie is a good woman, but
there is no such experience.

384
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:35,072
Are you there? It's a nursing
home.

385
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:39,785
I worked many medical tests
while my father was there.

386
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:43,539
Why not wear the same uniform
as the other sisters?

387
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,628
I was not formal.

388
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:51,505
What?

389
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:56,260
I got in the house other
photos and I hope

390
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:59,722
you'll respect my right
to privacy.

391
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:02,808
Even if you hold me against
my will.

392
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,029
Can I get this file?

393
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:16,906
Pardon?

394
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:21,327
Can I get this file? Please.

395
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:29,960
Well, you can. For now.
- Thank you.

396
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:36,884
Amanda, two things I want
to tell you.

397
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:41,931
The first is that crime
does not pay.

398
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:46,310
And second, I can'd feel good
about this kidnapping

399
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,233
as many people have suffered
because of it not just me.

400
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:57,404
But I think you're a beautiful
young lady.

401
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:02,368
Really? Thank you.

402
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:29,103
Who is it? - Loreal...
and Amanda.

403
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,606
Come.

404
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:45,995
Like I can not breathe,
and has shot more.

405
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:49,039
No, he turned.

406
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:52,585
Maybe hiccup. - Shut up,
I talk to Elaine.

407
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:55,963
Vida've done it before.

408
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,006
Is that bad?

409
00:45:57,214 --> 00:45:59,925
Could be. - What do I do?

410
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:02,428
Put your head. Come on.

411
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:08,184
Put your elbows on your knees.

412
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:11,020
Like that?

413
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:16,942
That's it. Okay, Amanda tell me
when you sell exactly twelve minutes.

414
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:19,445
It's going to be ten and
thirty four.

415
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:23,824
I'll put the water for tea.

416
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:26,410
So, how is Lo?

417
00:46:26,744 --> 00:46:28,871
I think it's working.

418
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,503
I'll be in the next room
if you need me.

419
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:41,634
Hey, thank you Elaine.

420
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:45,429
You're welcome, Loreal.

421
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:14,166
So, when will it happen?
- I'll have some more to cook.

422
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:18,128
I hope they come out earlier.

423
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:23,092
Loreal, there's nothing worse and
more dangerous than prevremenske pregnancy.

424
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:27,596
A woman should be Porada while
he can.

425
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,850
And how is it done?

426
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:34,520
Well, first he wants to stop it.

427
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,021
What else?

428
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,861
To avoid certain things that
cause. - What things?

429
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:47,241
Zaèinjenu food, long showers,

430
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:51,162
soda, closely underwear,
dancing...

431
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,247
No dancing?

432
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,749
Especially do not play rock
and roll.

433
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:03,883
Damn, and I was just in the
mood to play.

434
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:11,849
Go get your sister a glass
of water.

435
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:46,258
Did you hear me? She stopped
at 14-39 since Saturday.

436
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:47,801
You probably did something
wrong.

437
00:48:48,052 --> 00:48:50,012
No, I swear.

438
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:52,097
Listen just because this lately

439
00:48:52,348 --> 00:48:54,558
does not mean we should discount.

440
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:59,146
Maybe you prefer to stay with us.
Did you ever think of that?

441
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:03,943
To stay with us? You mean
that crazy?

442
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:08,155
No. Then we specify a reason
why someone like her

443
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,741
wanted to stay with us?

444
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:18,833
It is better to check the
numbers again.

445
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:14,513
You have no family, Elaine?

446
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:42,708
Some people have a gift but are
unable to use it. Sometimes

447
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:49,924
should not wait until their body
becomes used up to the present.

448
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:55,304
Do you understand?
No, not really.

449
00:50:58,474 --> 00:51:03,646
When I was younger, I could not
physically have a baby,

450
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,698
my emotional side, how to say...

451
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:21,163
It was hard. It's hard?

452
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:32,383
I was like everyone else, but now
I feel much better.

453
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,180
This is good.

454
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:41,892
There are many ways to give
a gift, not just one.

455
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:45,813
And not just the obvious.
Does that make sense?

456
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:49,692
Yes. There is.

457
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:19,054
Amanda, can you nurse to add
water? Of course.

458
00:52:19,263 --> 00:52:23,934
I do not want her back legs
swell. Fill to me. Thank you.

459
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:39,825
Have you checked the numbers
again?

460
00:52:40,493 --> 00:52:45,956
Administration are still
trying to escape. I told you.

461
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:09,772
Have you noticed how some crazy
not believe someone

462
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,108
who does not wear a chain of
Articles?

463
00:53:13,984 --> 00:53:17,905
There has been such. Elaine,
I knew that.

464
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,786
Whatever, but I did not care,
why should they?

465
00:53:35,506 --> 00:53:38,968
Elaine. Sister-sleep.

466
00:53:41,345 --> 00:53:43,681
I brought you something.

467
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,400
Hypnotized him. Eight minutes.

468
00:53:55,192 --> 00:53:57,903
It was very thoughtful.

469
00:54:00,114 --> 00:54:03,075
Go and wash.

470
00:54:56,504 --> 00:54:58,255
Lo, get up.

471
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:00,466
Lo.

472
00:55:10,434 --> 00:55:12,102
Lo, get up.

473
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:46,030
Okay, what is it?

474
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:50,367
What the hell?
Out of 475
00:54:29,360... > 00:54:31,120
It's nothing.

475
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:56,142
He's a good feeling, is not it?
What?

476
00:57:56,475 --> 00:57:59,937
A nice long shower.
That's right.

477
00:58:01,355 --> 00:58:03,691
It is better to obuèeš.

478
00:58:05,234 --> 00:58:09,905
I let my sister to sleep,
we'll have dinner later.

479
00:58:45,524 --> 00:58:48,402
Carefully Amanda, that's hot.

480
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,909
With mushrooms.

481
00:59:01,457 --> 00:59:02,583
I'm sorry.

482
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:04,627
Are you all right, Elaine?

483
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:07,296
I'm fine.

484
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:23,938
What is it?

485
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,525
Just thinking. - About what?

486
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:33,989
Well, if you ever thought of
how all this might take?

487
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:39,245
How can we stay in this house?
No, not really.

488
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,539
Well, that explains it.

489
00:59:41,872 --> 00:59:43,499
What explains?

490
00:59:43,874 --> 00:59:45,209
It's nothing.

491
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,336
What explains this?

492
00:59:47,711 --> 00:59:53,676
Well, it seems that people in
your position,

493
00:59:54,385 --> 00:59:57,179
would prefer that they move,

494
00:59:57,388 --> 01:00:02,560
instead of sitting in the same
place for weeks as ducks.

495
01:00:02,726 --> 01:00:06,147
As targets. Thank you, Amanda.

496
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:09,900
As there is no process of
elimination.

497
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:13,154
You say we should go from
here?

498
01:00:13,362 --> 01:00:17,741
Well, I do not make the decisions.
It's your show, right?

499
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:23,622
You know, I think that's right.

500
01:00:24,874 --> 01:00:27,585
I think I should go from here.

501
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:34,133
Wait a minute. Did a lot of
people asking, Elaine?

502
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:35,509
It's a silly question.

503
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:38,345
Do you? Of course.

504
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:41,682
My group from the church, I was in
charge of the coffee, you know?

505
01:00:41,932 --> 01:00:45,060
Remember, one reason why you
have not found?

506
01:00:45,269 --> 01:00:49,064
I'll tell you why, because this
is the hiding place for the killer.

507
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:52,902
Do not I know you? You think
I'm stupid?

508
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:30,314
Yes, healing very nicely.
Clear.

509
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:38,280
Can I ask you something?
Yes, of course.

510
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:43,994
She is interested in the true
nature of your visit here.

511
01:01:44,912 --> 01:01:46,914
Well, this is my house.

512
01:01:47,164 --> 01:01:50,292
Yes, I'm just curious,

513
01:01:50,709 --> 01:01:52,920
if you are going to join
someone else?

514
01:01:54,088 --> 01:01:58,551
I came here to be alone for
a while. Really?

515
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,721
I need space from time to time.

516
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,558
My family knows that.

517
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:12,690
Well, I think we need to
concentrate on each other,

518
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,609
in order to survive.

519
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:20,239
Have you seen these guys?

520
01:02:20,573 --> 01:02:26,453
They do not. You odvlaèiš
attention to them until the run.

521
01:02:26,662 --> 01:02:28,998
I'll go to a pay phone and call
the sheriff,

522
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:32,084
will come soon, my acquaintance.

523
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:36,380
He will come soon, I promise.
So?

524
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:42,845
I think it's a very
interesting plan.

525
01:02:43,053 --> 01:02:47,057
I razmisliæu about him.

526
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:58,736
What are you doing? Why do not
you untie?

527
01:02:59,028 --> 01:03:01,906
No, what you do, what do
you do?

528
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:06,619
I do not understand why you were
not able to stay home with your family?

529
01:03:07,578 --> 01:03:09,121
What?

530
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,085
Hello.

531
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:21,634
You know it's all a lot of glass?
Yeah, I know.

532
01:03:27,014 --> 01:03:29,892
What can you play?

533
01:03:30,893 --> 01:03:33,020
Hide, have you heard of
that game?

534
01:03:36,315 --> 01:03:38,734
It looks like he's angry.

535
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:40,820
Or just weird.

536
01:03:41,487 --> 01:03:46,116
It seems odd, but it has that
special gift.

537
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,996
What a gift? - Designate a gift
that certain people have.

538
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,084
You want it?

539
01:03:58,587 --> 01:04:00,673
No, thank you.

540
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:07,763
Tonight we have a weird juice
if you want to drop by.

541
01:04:08,222 --> 01:04:11,225
That's okay, we have a hot
meal.

542
01:04:15,855 --> 01:04:20,276
You will not tell anyone
about him?

543
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:25,573
I still have my picture? - Yes.

544
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:30,828
Maybe I'll drop by tomorrow.

545
01:04:32,705 --> 01:04:34,248
Yes, you may.

546
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:40,629
Take care.

547
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,593
Are you going to Elaine?

548
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:52,266
Loreal thought we'd stop
smoking.

549
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:55,478
We will. I'm sorry.

550
01:04:55,728 --> 01:04:58,522
I wish I did not sit in that
chair.

551
01:04:58,772 --> 01:04:59,899
Why?

552
01:05:00,107 --> 01:05:01,901
I would not sit.

553
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,696
Lo, do not sit in that chair.

554
01:05:14,455 --> 01:05:17,625
Are we going to sing?
No, we'll talk.

555
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:21,086
We'll talk about serious things,
about the future.

556
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:39,355
You know Elaine certain before we
lived a life that does not tolerate baby

557
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:42,191
even that we want and do not
want it.

558
01:05:42,566 --> 01:05:45,986
I do not mind. - I do not start.

559
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:48,906
I've been thinking a lot...

560
01:06:02,294 --> 01:06:05,589
What's this? - I'm talking about.

561
01:06:05,923 --> 01:06:09,593
I thought it was stupid to give
her child hostage,

562
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,473
but you're like most people,
Elaine, I see it now.

563
01:06:14,723 --> 01:06:18,227
You are overcome frown.

564
01:06:23,649 --> 01:06:34,451
You have the knowledge, medical
experience and not only that, you're right.

565
01:06:51,135 --> 01:06:53,345
Who the hell is this?

566
01:06:55,014 --> 01:06:57,683
You're supposed to take his
shoes Elaine.

567
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,540
Can I ask you a question,
Elaine?

568
01:07:22,374 --> 01:07:26,754
Have you ever heard of the
hostage taken hostage?

569
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:29,673
She was only trying to help.

570
01:07:29,882 --> 01:07:33,969
What kind of crazy person would
do that? Well, we just did it.

571
01:07:34,178 --> 01:07:35,429
It's not the same to me,

572
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:38,724
Do not you see that it should
be different than us.

573
01:07:39,683 --> 01:07:42,520
You probably never had children.

574
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:48,567
I do not understand, just helped.
- I guarantee it's not a nurse.

575
01:08:11,632 --> 01:08:13,259
Out of the car-what?

576
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:15,553
I mean it out of the car.

577
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:18,097
Lo stop, stop.

578
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:34,822
Damn, Lo. - What did you say?

579
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:37,283
I said, damn.

580
01:08:37,575 --> 01:08:40,327
Do you want you to go out,
do you want?

581
01:08:41,954 --> 01:08:45,791
Who are you with me, with
me or her?

582
01:09:45,726 --> 01:09:47,686
Do not you want to sit
in front?

583
01:09:48,187 --> 01:09:50,231
No, thank you.

584
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:18,384
Let me stop, you can not
sleep here.

585
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:24,265
Listen I'm sorry that it turned
out like that, but it is.

586
01:10:24,473 --> 01:10:25,975
And better for what I have
now realized,

587
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:29,228
so we have time to come up
with something. - Stop playing.

588
01:10:29,395 --> 01:10:31,772
What? I told you to stop
that play.

589
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:34,358
Who's playing, I'm freezing.

590
01:10:34,525 --> 01:10:39,780
Play and looks like a rock, and
You'll get contractions and so cut.

591
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:41,699
Who told you that to me?

592
01:10:41,907 --> 01:10:44,660
No one has said that.
And who is out asshole?

593
01:10:44,994 --> 01:10:47,580
But it should not stop
you playing.

594
01:10:59,508 --> 01:11:04,013
Stop Lo. I mean it, stop
it please.

595
01:11:08,517 --> 01:11:11,103
You'll get contractions,
please stop.

596
01:11:13,731 --> 01:11:14,982
Stop it.

597
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:26,243
Get up, come on.

598
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:30,164
I told you to stand up.

599
01:11:32,249 --> 01:11:34,752
It's still early. So?

600
01:11:37,796 --> 01:11:39,882
What is it? Nothing.

601
01:11:41,008 --> 01:11:44,595
You look like you've swallowed
a fly. - Well, I'm not.

602
01:11:55,731 --> 01:11:58,526
Give me five minutes, then come
in... - I will not go into.

603
01:11:59,568 --> 01:12:04,949
What? I said I will not go
in to. Crime does not pay.

604
01:12:05,324 --> 01:12:08,369
Damn me and you gave her
our food.

605
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:13,749
Okay, sit here and act like
an ass, but watch out for the cops.

606
01:13:16,187 --> 01:13:19,148
Lo, where are you?

607
01:13:24,528 --> 01:13:27,156
What are you doing?
- Did you see the cops? - Yes.

608
01:13:27,364 --> 01:13:30,826
Did he see you?
- Yes. - Shit.

609
01:13:31,744 --> 01:13:36,582
On what are you standing?
- On the crates. - Are there others?

610
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:40,669
A few. - Line them up.

611
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:12,159
You want to eat? Why do you
keep looking at your stomach?

612
01:14:13,327 --> 01:14:18,624
You have cramps, right? Got
them from last night?

613
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:24,129
No ovako. -Did not I tell you
not to play like that last night.

614
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:27,424
Did not I say...
- Shut up, please.

615
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:34,431
What are you doing?

616
01:14:34,598 --> 01:14:36,392
Look I do not want to get
arrested because of me,

617
01:14:36,642 --> 01:14:40,020
But the cops know medicine
will die if I do not.

618
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:42,273
We're not going until they come.

619
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:06,589
Lo, we can not stay.

620
01:15:06,964 --> 01:15:08,757
Now will come.

621
01:15:10,092 --> 01:15:12,094
It was already half an hour.

622
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:17,349
The policeman saw me. He saw,
too. - I know.

623
01:15:17,683 --> 01:15:20,686
Do you think that we are
now not after?

624
01:15:21,896 --> 01:15:23,355
No.

625
01:15:26,192 --> 01:15:27,610
No?

626
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:35,034
I think no one is chasing,
never.

627
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:38,287
What are you talking about?

628
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:41,540
You know what I'm talking
about.

629
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:13,989
Will die in the middle of
the damn time in this damn car.

630
01:16:15,324 --> 01:16:19,453
You're not. I do not want
to die to me.

631
01:18:07,978 --> 01:18:10,105
Elaine, I am.

632
01:18:16,654 --> 01:18:19,448
I thought you were never
going to come.

633
01:18:20,032 --> 01:18:25,996
Neither do we. - Do you know
how dangerous these roads?

634
01:18:30,459 --> 01:18:34,296
A radio does not work on more
than two hundred meters.

635
01:18:37,758 --> 01:18:40,803
I did not deserve what your
sister did.

636
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:44,807
It was a terrible thing and
I did not deserve it.

637
01:18:47,601 --> 01:18:51,313
We know. We're sorry.

638
01:18:53,023 --> 01:18:54,024
We?

639
01:18:57,111 --> 01:18:59,488
Yeah, me and Lo. We're sorry.

640
01:19:10,457 --> 01:19:12,418
You'll be fine, look who's
here.

641
01:19:18,424 --> 01:19:19,967
Tell her you're sorry.

642
01:19:23,596 --> 01:19:25,639
I'm sorry.

643
01:19:26,265 --> 01:19:27,892
She said.

644
01:19:38,777 --> 01:19:40,362
Can you help?

645
01:19:44,783 --> 01:19:47,119
Excuse me for a moment.

646
01:19:55,044 --> 01:19:57,254
I'll give my best.

647
01:20:05,763 --> 01:20:08,849
It should not take much,
does it?

648
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:19,568
Okay, I'm going to stop, and
falsehoods will leave prestaæu right?

649
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:24,990
Lo, look at me. Look at me.

650
01:20:25,741 --> 01:20:29,203
You're not going anywhere,
do you understand me?

651
01:20:29,495 --> 01:20:34,333
You're not going anywhere,
and I, I'll stay here and rodiæeš this baby.

652
01:20:37,628 --> 01:20:39,588
Do you believe me?

653
01:20:43,717 --> 01:20:46,637
Do you trust me?

654
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:52,351
Then stop resisting.

655
01:21:29,263 --> 01:21:30,473
Push.

656
01:21:51,327 --> 01:21:53,704
I think you should pick it up.

657
01:22:17,102 --> 01:22:20,356
Elaine Damn, he's really
a boy.

658
01:22:52,054 --> 01:22:57,560
Well, Amanda, we have a
long road

659
01:22:58,227 --> 01:23:00,771
Your sister will certainly be
busy,

660
01:23:01,105 --> 01:23:05,109
but I would like it uèiniš
something.

661
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:11,991
What's this?

662
01:23:12,241 --> 01:23:16,579
I'd like to write a story of
500 words or more

663
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:20,291
about certain lessons that
are learned.

664
01:23:20,499 --> 01:23:23,961
Lessons? - O hostages.

665
01:23:24,837 --> 01:23:25,671
How?

666
01:23:26,922 --> 01:23:31,010
As soon as we set up, and I
intend to write one.

667
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,391
Well, if you're gonna be'd
feel better about that, Elaine.

668
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:40,519
I believe I will.

669
01:23:41,437 --> 01:23:44,023
Okay, fasten all.

670
01:23:50,321 --> 01:23:52,364
You sure know how to drive,
Elaine?

671
01:23:52,573 --> 01:23:55,493
Loreal, what kind of question
is that?

672
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:06,462
Have you ever thought someone
before you met him?

673
01:24:10,049 --> 01:24:15,721
These things really happen.
Weird, incredible things.

674
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:20,893
I swear to constantly happens.

675
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
