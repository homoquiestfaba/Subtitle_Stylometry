<i>I drove three days</i>

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,595
<i>and two nights</i>
<i>from Maryland to San Diego,</i>

4
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,695
<i>all the way along asking</i>

5
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,322
<i>why was I doing this?</i>

6
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,312
<i>But there are times when</i>
<i>thinking won't bring answers,</i>

7
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:31,824
<i>and then suddenly an image</i>
<i>puts it all together.</i>

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,574
<i>When I crossed</i>
<i>the Coronado Bridge,</i>

9
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:36,529
<i>the answer became crystal clear.</i>

10
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,957
<i>I once heard a story</i>
<i>about a guy in Chicago</i>

11
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,784
<i>who liked</i>
<i>to jump out of airplanes.</i>

12
00:02:42,418 --> 00:02:44,920
<i>He worked as an accountant,</i>
<i>but every weekend,</i>

13
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,464
<i>he would drive out</i>

00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:47,915
<i>and go free-fall skydiving.</i>

15
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,776
<i>Somebody asked the guy</i>

16
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,586
<i>He said it was simple.</i>

17
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:54,705
<i>He was afraid of heights.</i>

Scoot your bony ass down. Scoot.

That is the worst bunch of names
I've ever heard in my life,

27
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:20,030

28

You can call me chief

call me Bosco.

00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:30,150
You're all volunteers.

33
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,426
We don't force anybody
to be a Seal.

34
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:35,405
So, at any time you can't cut it,

35
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,491
anytime you can't do
another push-up,

36
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:38,742
can't run another mile,

37
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,993
can't stand the sound
of my voice one more time,

38
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,985
all you have to do is ring
that ship's bell three times,

39
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:44,421
and you're disenrolled.

40
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,373
Anybody ready to ring it now?

41
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:49,366
Come on, ladies.

42
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:51,118
Save yourself a ton of grief.

43
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,523
How about you, Hammer?

44
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:57,499
Why wait ten, 12, 14 weeks

45
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,311
after I've run that smirk off your face?

46
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:03,332
Do yourself a favor. Ring my bell.

47
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,385
I'd like to, sir,
but I don't know you that well.

48
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:12,037
You're a tough guy,
aren't you, Hammer?

49
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:13,584
Yes, sir.

50
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,655
So, all of you guys
are tough guys, huh?

51
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,708
How many of you little chest-pounders
think you can kick my ass?

52
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,384
Step forward.

53
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,446
What's wrong with you, mister?

54
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,199
You don't think
you can kick my ass?

00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:38,751
No, sir.

56
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,451

Want to do it again?

What's your problem?

You're giving the teams

You want to give the guy
his money back? Fine.

But you're gonna have to
go through me to do it.

If I want trouble,

115
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,104
I'll look for it

Well, looks like a tie to me.

So, no one's gonna get afternoon liberty.

Every Seal is at home in the water.

The water is his lover,
his mother, his friend.

I know what you're thinking.

"Air, got to get some air."

But you're gonna do what I tell you.

145
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,673
Blow out all the air
in your lungs and sink.

146
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:39,450
When you hit the bottom,
you kick off hard.

147
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:40,870
When you surface,

148
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,162
take in a deep breath

149
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:44,289
and exhale,
so you can go down again.

150
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,827
Mazzoli, get him.

151
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:02,991
If he wants to live,

152
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:05,452
he's gonna have to exhale
all that air out of his lungs.

Hammer, Mazzoli, cut that shit out!

157
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:21,531
Get over here.

158
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,090
Never...

159
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,383
You never play games in the water.

160
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,715
It can cost a mission.
It can cost a life.

161
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:30,018
You got that?

162
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,193
I thought you two guys

163
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:33,554
were the best in the class,

164
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:36,158
but what you've just proven
is you're the best two assholes.

165
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:37,851
So, we're gonna slap
some manners in you.

166
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,679
I want you on the point in five minutes.

167

Mazzoli, measure up.

172
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,282
We're gonna get this
out of your system real quick

173
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,539
and in a military manner.

174
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:10,100
Open hand only at my command.

185

Mazzoli.

186
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,748
I think we should switch hands.

187
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,941
I agree. Otherwise, we're gonna be kissing
like this for the rest of our lives.

188
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:39,266
[Bosco] Mazzoli.

189
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,656
That's much better.

190
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:43,896
Downright refreshing.

195
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:01,861
All right, boys.

196
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:03,112
That's enough.

197
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:04,596
Attention!

198
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:07,232
Right face!

199
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,335
Double time back to the barracks.

200
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:11,628
Let's move!

00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,098
Thank you.

209
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,769
[man 1]
And I got something for you, Mr. Hammer.

210
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:48,473
Get your shit together.
We've had enough.

211
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,675
It's hard enough trying
to get through this course

212
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:52,302
without taking all of your crap, too.

213
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,345
[man 1] Looks like you need
an attitude adjustment.

214
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:56,173
And you're just the guys to do it?

215
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,742
I don't think so.

216
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,578
We got more than enough
for a decent blanket party.

217
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,121
Come on, man. Cool down.

218
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:10,336
You got enough for two blankets?

219
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,771
You're taking his side?

220
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,232
You're taking my side?

221
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,957
We're a team.

222
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,721
We all are.

223
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:21,181
Fucking A, ringknocker.

225
00:13:58,384 --> 00:13:59,628
You with these guys?

226
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:02,722
[woman] Hammer!

227
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,808
-How's it going?
-Hey.

228
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:07,519
This is for you.

229
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,312
Come on. You wanna dance with me?

230
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:10,271
Yeah.

231
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,648
[woman laughing]

232
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:16,094
Hey, Hammer.

233
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:18,213
Hey, I'm right here, you know.

234
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:28,957
[woman] Yeah!

235
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,970
You probably don't remember me, but...

236
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,547
I do.

237
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:55,033
But it's not to your benefit.

238
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,136
[Mazzoli] I thought we had a moment.

239
00:14:58,219 --> 00:14:59,262
Wanna dance?

240
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,723
No. I can't compete with that.

241
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:04,434
You're a hell of a lot prettier
than she is.

242
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:05,794
She's a friend.

243
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:07,871
[Mazzoli] Great.
She's dancing with my best pal.

244
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,631
[woman] Yeah? I know him, too.

245
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,425
Really? You know Hammer?

246
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:14,678
Hammer thinks "How do you do?"
are fighting words,

247
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:16,764
drinks tequila like it was tax-deductible,

248
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:20,601
and thinks women are
life-support systems for a...

249
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:24,855
But he has his moments.

250
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:26,157
[Hammer] What you talking about?

251
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,325
You.

252
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:29,369
Dean-o, this is Barbara Almeyer,

253
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:30,961
this is Diane Bender. Dean Mazzoli.

254
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:32,671
-How you doing?
-Annapolis.

255
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:34,423
Annapolis Seal? That's cool.

256
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:36,925
-Can I see your ring?
-Sure.

257
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:40,480
You know, Diane's a suborbital
delivery systems analyst.

258
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:41,630
She works for Northrop.

259

I'm a marine biologist, actually.

[Bosco] You still a tough guy, Hammer?

-Yes, sir!
-You wanna fuck with me?

I want you to give me 100 push-ups.

Put that head in the water.

Put your head in the water.

Roll in that mud, frogs.

And with you?

what the story is with you guys.

That's a hell of a frogman, huh?

Now I see why they train
you guys in underwater tactics.

Let me... Let me see if
I can turn this damn thing over.

Maybe I can help.

Is that what that is?

348
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:19,951
It would be great to find out

349
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:22,429
you and Hammer were
actually brother and sister.

00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:25,915

What mission?

902
01:09:36,648 --> 01:09:37,774
Okay.

903
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,169
You take care of yourself.

904
01:09:43,344 --> 01:09:44,347
Okay?

905
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,544
For both of us.

906
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,618
The lieutenant's eyesight
is getting worse and worse.

907
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:14,469
You wanted to see me. Is anything wrong?

908
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:17,805
No. Quite the contrary. I feel great.
I'm ready to be released.

909
01:10:17,943 --> 01:10:19,932
Don't you think
I should be the judge of that?

910
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:20,968
[Hammer] Absolutely.

911
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:22,349
That's why I called for you.

912
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:26,982
Would you sign that?

913
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:30,110
What is this? Where did you get this?

914
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:31,299
Will you sign it?

915
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:37,364
I will. In maybe as soon as ten days.

916
01:10:37,676 --> 01:10:39,399
I'm sorry. That's not acceptable.

917
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:40,434
Not acceptable?

918
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:44,446
Look, pal, I don't expect
you to understand this,

919
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:47,240
but I have got to get out of here today.

920
01:10:52,787 --> 01:10:54,334
[doctor] I understand fully.

921
01:10:54,456 --> 01:10:56,624
As a matter of fact, I'm going
on that mission myself

922
01:10:56,718 --> 01:10:57,768
as medical director.

923
01:10:58,543 --> 01:11:00,093
We're shipping out tonight.

924
01:11:00,176 --> 01:11:01,893
It's a pity you're stuck in the hospital.

925
01:11:01,977 --> 01:11:03,907
I'd be happy to dress your wounds.

926
01:11:05,718 --> 01:11:06,856
What can I say, doc?

927
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:08,387
Have a good mission.

928
01:11:09,337 --> 01:11:10,787

the complementary elements.

936
