3
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:44,062
I'll be right back.

4
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:42,312
Do you remember that
phase that jack went trough?

5
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:45,580
When he literally would take

6
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:48,604
everything out of his bins.

7
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,896
And toy area, and set
it up all over the house.

8
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:54,247
Yeah.
Yeah.

9
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,830
I talked to Ashley the other day

10
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:57,580
and Connor's one hundred
percent in that phase.

11
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,830
That's tough.

12
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:03,205
She is dying. She's like, I need to
be around people that I can talk to,

13
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:06,229
and not have to... I mean, she's done.

14
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:08,538
She's got to get away.

15
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:10,479
Alright.
What can we do?

16
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:14,747
And, we have to bring David.

17
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:17,771
Alright. He's funny, he's funny.
He is.

18
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:20,413
He doesn't work much.

19
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:23,247
But he's funny. Then why do
you still have him work for you?

20
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,562
Because he's funny.

21
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:25,580
Comedy relief.

22
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,247
He's a good guy.
Yeah, he is.

23
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:29,579
No, we like him.

24
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,372
But what can we-
Only becuase he's funny.

25
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:35,396
That's the only reason
Ashley likes him too. True.

26
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:40,103
Um, I don't know. Bring them here.

27
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,228
Do you think they'd make it?

28
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:45,353
I mean it's so pretty, but I don't know.

29
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:50,122
Justdon't tell them.

30
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:51,521
Okay.
Yeah.

31
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:54,997
Just tell them we'll go
camping or something,

32
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,562
but don't tell them where.

33
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,937
Or that they have to walk a lot.

34
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:01,771
Yeah.

35
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:07,312
What about Chad?

36
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:09,538
I haven't seen Chad in so long.

37
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:11,955
I know. We should get him out of the bar.

38
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,455
Is he still there all the time?
All the time.

39
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,247
I haven't seen him in a long time either.

40
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,454
He's supposed to be my best friend.

41
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:18,812
We need to go.

42
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:20,789
And Becky?

43
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:24,646
I see her, just not in person.

44
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,853
Yeah, you see her alright. Influencer!

45
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,771
I still don't know what that is.

46
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,122
Aren't you an influencer?
No.

47
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,146
You influence me all the time.
For bad things. That's my job.

48
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:42,937
No, ask him. He probably needs
to come out more than Ashley.

49
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,288
True. Yeah, I'll ask him.

50
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,913
Does he like to hike?

51
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,937
He goes outdoors. I mean, he won't mind it.

52
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:54,103
Hopefully he's in shape.
I don't know, bar shape is different.

53
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:57,663
I know he doesn't do much else.

54
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:00,687
Doesn't matter. We won't tell them where.
We'll just tell them camping.

55
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:04,205
Because they should see this.
Maybe they'll get out more.

56
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,979
Yeah.

57
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,771
We'll ask them. I'll tell Ashley.

58
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,104
It's a deal.

59
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,312
Okay.
Let's go.

60
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:17,288
Good.
Ready?

61
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,163
Great.
You hungry?

62
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:19,079
Hungry.
Now?

63
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,103
Let's go.

64
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,228
The Karate Kid!

65
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:49,271
Kai is following us!

66
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,646
Dana. This was a really good idea.

67
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:29,622
I can't take all the credit.
Jack had a little to do with it.

68
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:30,978
Yes I did.

69
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:35,372
It kind of reminds me
of like old days though.

70
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,454
Sneaking away for a couple days.

71
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,158
But we don't have to worry about my parents
finding out that we're not really at Jennifer's.

72
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,437
Right!

73
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,896
How did Connor take it?

74
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:48,521
Poor baby. He like wouldn't
even let us leave the door.

75
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,372
He was blocking it. He didn't
want us to put our bags in the car.

76
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,821
But then Grandma showed up with donuts,
and he was like shooing us out.

77
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:56,288
He was kicking us out basically.

78
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:57,913
That's just like Jack Jr.

79
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:00,937
You know who's reallly
excited to brave the outdoors?

80
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:02,562
Becky.

81
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:06,687
She can't wait to get
dirty, and eat out of a can.

82
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:08,562
Hey Becky. Can you hear me?

83
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,312
What?

84
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:12,396
Go ahead. Get some more followers on Insta.

85
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:13,937
Shut up.

86
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:15,771
That's terrible.

87
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,646
Take a look at Chad.

88
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,646
That poor guy.

89
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:23,312
He hasn't had a break
since he opened that bar.

90
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,062
How long has it been?

91
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:27,896
8 years?

92
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:30,062
70, 80 hours a week.

93
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,437
Poor guy.

94
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,146
You're a good friend.

95
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,521
I'm the best friend.

96
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:39,521
Take a look at that

97
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:53,604
We still have another two hours to go.

98
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,229
Two hours?

99
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:57,479
Look how pretty the sky is.

100
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,747
Did we forget something?

101
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:28,812
No. I want to talk to the locals, and see if there
is anything we should know before we head out there.

102
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:30,812
Good idea.

103
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,729
Sporting goods?

104
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,936
Wanna get some beef jerkey.

105
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:40,646
You already packed all of your beef jerkey.

106
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:42,061
Can't have enough beef jerkey.

107
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,206
Right Jack?

108
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,936
That is right, not enough, ever!

109
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:50,771
Are you coming?

110
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,561
Yeah.

111
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,811
You're awake.

112
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:58,936
Good morning.

113
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:01,604
Good morning Chad.

114
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:03,854
Hey.

115
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,479
You can't take these guys anywhere.

116
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:17,163
You look beautiful...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

117
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:17,479
How about this?

118
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:19,104
What are we doing?

119
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:21,538
It's pretty.
You want one of those?

120
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:22,663
Kind of.
A mountain lion?

121
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:23,687
Wow!

122
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:26,396
This place is cool man!
Check it out.

123
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:29,354
Whoa!

124
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:30,646
You got it.

125
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:35,646
Hey ma.

126
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:40,162
Thanks a lot for inviting us.
No, thank you for coming,

127
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,662
I know how hard it is
for you guys to get away.

128
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:47,311
Yeah. I, I...
I really needed this.

129
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,455
I swear that place is gonna kill me.

130
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,479
It is gonna kill ya.
Those 17 hour days.

131
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,061
So... How are you?

132
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,580
No complaints man, I'm doing great.

133
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:01,456
Kids?

134
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,479
Dana's great, the kids are great.
Good.

135
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:06,288
You want one?

136
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:07,312
Kids?

137
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:14,396
I already have my hands full.

138
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,771
Lord have mercy. Come on man.

139
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:32,729
Wait a minute. What do we have here?

140
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:36,354
Finally somebody worth my attention.

141
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,229
Mamacitas, little chicas.

142
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:44,311
Crisiva devichski

143
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:48,436
Little lolitas, yeah.

144
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:52,936
Wow, that one.

145
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:55,979
Yeah!

146
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:05,729
Is anybody even here?

147
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:10,396
Like a clerk?

148
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:37,729
Hey Ashley! He's cuter than you are.

149
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:44,896
Excuse me!

150
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:52,497
I'm sorry young folks. All my help
called in sick today, I'm here by myself.

151
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,872
It's alright.
It's fine.

152
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:56,896
You got ladies with you. We don't
usually get such pretty ladies in here.

153
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:59,747
We got a couple of them, that's for sure.
Special day!

154
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,622
So, how can I help you guys?

155
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,372
Yeah, we're headed up to big cat trail.

156
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:06,372
And a couple of these
ladies are first time hikers.

157
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,830
Really?
Kind of show them-

158
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,854
It wouldn't be my first
choice to take hiker.

159
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,913
I mean, it can be treacherous.
Treacherous?

160
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:17,580
There's some legends here, I mean

161
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:20,455
Sedona has their vortexes,

162
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,997
But we got some crazy shit out there.

163
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,312
I mean, you go way back
to the 60s, cattle mutilations.

164
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:30,896
Remember reading about that? They found cattle with
their eyballs cut out, their buttholes cut out.

165
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,872
Stuff like that.
We're just gling for a hike.

166
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,872
I mean, skunk apes. You know what that is?

167
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:39,747
You watch TV?
Yeah, Yeah.

168
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:42,771
It looks like a sasquatch. It's
like sasquatch's little brother.

169
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:46,021
Down in Florida there's legends.
Well they've been spotted up here too.

170
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,872
People have gone up there looking for them.
And

171
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,580
Where are you taking us?

172
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:53,997
Satan worshippers.

173
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:57,021
I was up there once, on a hill top.
There we go.

174
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:00,896
I actually found that up there.
What the heck is this doing up there?

175
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:04,687
I added this later, I
mean it's kind of a trophy.

176
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:10,062
This just doesn't occur, I mean somebody-Maybe
we can find one of those up there. Who knows?

177
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:12,872
Itll go right in your bar.

178
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:15,872
Hopefully you got
plans to protect yourself.

179
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,706
With something.

180
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,729
We got a little .22.

181
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:22,437
Exactly. A little .22.
What skunk ape is gonna

182
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:28,062
is gonna laugh at a .22. I got some stuff that is
a little more exotic you might be interested in.

183
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:32,146
Yeah, but we're just going on a
hike though. We should be fine.

184
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:37,104
Where are you taking us? What are
you talking about? This is gonna be great!

185
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:41,997
I don't know. He's talking
about apes and skulls and stuff.

186
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,561
And you believe that?

187
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:48,646
It might be knid of cool.
Exactly! i knew you'd come around.

188
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,330
We appreciate it. We thank you so much.

189
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,080
Alrigh. Don't say I didn't warn you.

190
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:54,104
Hey, I found it!

191
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,479
I knew these things were real.

192
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,562
Get one of me.

193
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,896
New profile pic. Let me see it.

194
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:10,330
It's awesome.

195
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:14,771
Sir. Hey, are we gonna find any of these,
like live ones out there, out in the woods?

196
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:17,122
I wouldn't worry about that.

197
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:20,122
I'd worry about those guys up there.

198
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:22,913
They get twice that size too.

199
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:26,747
It mean, it's a chupacabra
for goodness sake. Is it real?

200
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:29,771
Those are gonna be out there? These
are real. That's a mountain lion. Yeah.

201
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,412
Thewhole southwest is full of those.

202
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,412
Yeah right.
And that's half as big as they get.

203
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:38,436
So that's what I'd worry about.

204
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,686
Thanks!

205
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:42,804
Are you guys ready to go?
Yeah.

206
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:44,271
Let's get out of here.

207
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:48,936
Did he really just say skunk ape?

208
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:54,354
Yeah, skunk apre. You
know, bigfoot of the south.

209
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:58,287
Right, but.. Out here?

210
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:01,312
He also talked about a
goat man, devil worshippers.

211
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,937
Don't worry. None of tat is real.

212
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,312
They are trusting us.

213
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:10,687
Is it safe?
Yes, it's safe. What are you worried about?

214
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:13,521
Come on.

215
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,021
Now this is what I'm
talking about young folks.

216
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:30,021
We'll get some yeehaws out of that skunk
ape, and they will sit up and take notice.

217
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:32,936
A real flamethrower.

218
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:43,896
Okay. You can go ahead
and get some skunk ape.

219
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,646
Get your hands off me you damn dirty ape!

220
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:51,936
Yeah, get some!

221
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:54,146
Take some of that!

222
00:16:57,979 --> 00:16:59,146
We gota get two man.
Yes!

223
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,646
Mother-aper.

224
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:04,311
Yippee ki yay!

225
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:06,936
Take that skunk ape.

226
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:23,646
That's what you need
right there young folks!

227
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,561
That's how we do it!

228
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,372
This is it?

229
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:06,372
Yeah, no one for miles.

230
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:09,163
No cell service either.

231
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:11,705
Yeah babe, that's the point.

232
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:14,729
You know. You just get away
from it all fr a couple of days.

233
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,312
As long as I'm back for my
Facebook live Thursday night.

234
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,312
You'll be back.

235
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,538
So, what do you think?

236
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:33,562
It's gorgeous.

237
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,979
We have to bring the kids back.

238
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:41,288
Alright you guys. We have two options.

239
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:44,604
Take jackrabbit trail. It's
about three miles more or less.

240
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:48,247
Or we can take all the gear with us.

241
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:51,271
Head up to big cat trail and
camp out there for the night.

242
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:55,479
How far is big cat?

243
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:57,997
Seven miles.

244
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,705
S... Seven miles?

245
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:03,354
Seven miles?
One way.

246
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:07,104
Can I vote for rabbit?
Me too.

247
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,288
No. Guys come one, we're here.

248
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:12,330
Let's do it. Big cat trail.

249
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:14,580
I agree, big cat trail. It's up to you.

250
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:17,604
What do you say? Big cat or jackrabbit?

251
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:20,562
Jackrabbit.

252
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:23,521
The rabbit wins boys.

253
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:26,354
Yeah, sure.

254
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:29,247
Wait, wait. What if it was a tie?

255
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,604
Then the driver's vote counts as two.

256
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:32,937
Wow.

257
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:34,248
Those are the rules.

258
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:37,271
Wrong. The driver's
wife's vote counts as two.

259
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,396
I didn't learn that in civics class.

260
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,461
You didn't learn anything in civics.

261
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:44,604
True.

262
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:41,038
Alright. That's good enough.

263
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:43,955
Take only what you need,
and don't forget your water.

264
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:46,872
And leave everything else in the tent.

265
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:49,896
Come on! Let's get this
party started. Let's go!

266
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:56,229
Wait, wait! My phone.

267
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:03,146
Only what you need Becky. You
just said there's no reception out here.

268
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,396
Photos.

269
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:17,146
Wait! Can i have my phone?

270
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:26,646
Come on you guys.
Let's go!

271
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:47,187
You don't even pause, you don't even pause!

272
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,396
Look. Even her phone looks like a camera.

273
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:05,312
Control your man Ashley.

274
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:45,729
I need to get a stick.

275
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:48,104
That's a good one.

276
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:49,854
This is pretty cool.

277
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:52,437
Ouch!

278
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:55,437
I must really love you.
I guess so.

279
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:03,771
He's really skinny though.

280
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:31,396
He's gotta ruin everything.

281
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:33,996
I don't know how you-
You ruined my life!

282
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,437
Geez!

283
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:47,396
Hey! What are you doing?

284
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:53,021
Can we help you?

285
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:58,229
I didn't mean to scare
anyone, I just saw the campsite.

286
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:01,872
Making sure everyone was okay.

287
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,080
Jack.

288
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:05,038
Tex.

289
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:07,955
Yeah, we're all fine.

290
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:11,646
Probably be a good idea for you
to head back to your campsite.

291
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:14,437
You know. Before it gets too dark.

292
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:17,521
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

293
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,663
You guys have a good rest of the night.

294
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:21,187
Alright, you too.

295
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:56,247
Did you guys think that
guys was super creepy?

296
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,979
100 percent.

297
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,705
He was definitely up to something.

298
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:03,729
I swear he was this close to
stealing all of our stuff from the tent.

299
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:07,413
Yeah. We need to take to take
everything with us tomorrow.

300
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:09,330
And what we don't, we
need to put in the truck.

301
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:12,354
I'm sure he was just a
good samaritan on a stroll.

302
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:16,247
By himself?

303
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:18,312
Sarcasm font Becky.

304
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:23,271
Whatever.

305
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:37,913
All joking aside. A friend of mine
is a game warden in California.

306
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:40,937
California? Near Los Angeles?

307
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:44,330
Yeah. Right in downtown LA. Bam!

308
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,788
You should see the wildlife there.

309
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,663
No. Up in Tahoe.

310
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,664
Charles?

311
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:54,163
Yeah. He told me that he is actually
responsble for 300 square miles of wilderness.

312
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:56,747
Just himself and his K-9.

313
00:26:56,771 --> 00:26:58,330
Wow. Did he ever run into Bigfoot?

314
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:00,646
I'd love, like, his autograph.

315
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:04,247
A game warden's autograph?

316
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:05,622
No! Bigfoot's autograph.

317
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:07,646
You know how much money I'd make off that?

318
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:14,396
Anyway, he told me that

319
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:18,562
the National Parks were full
of people running from the law.

320
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:22,979
Escaped convicts, felons, bail jumpers.

321
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:25,729
Seriously?

322
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:29,312
Yeah. He has a bunch of stories about
encounters that he's had.

323
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:35,271
I don't know. They run out into the woods
thinking that no one will ever find them.

324
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:40,562
Game warden surprises
them. They have nothing to lose.

325
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:45,062
And they are usually armed.
It's a dangerous situation.

326
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:50,062
Wow man. Thanks for the bedtime story.

327
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,562
It's better to be aware.

328
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:58,229
So that guy today could
have been a murderer?

329
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:05,187
Could have. Could have been a hiker.

330
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:08,330
That reminds me of a campfire story.

331
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,354
These three boys were at wilderness camp
and they were sneaking out-

332
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:22,729
Between the girl cabin and the girl cabin.

333
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:24,521
Was-

334
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:28,562
Jumping chollas.

335
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:32,396
Those damn chollas.

336
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,687
On that note. We're gonna to go to bed.

337
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:47,187
But we were just in to-

338
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:50,979
Goodnight guys.

339
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:53,437
Giddy up!

340
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:00,354
Well, would you look at the time.

341
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,229
Where's my watch?

342
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:07,146
Maybe you left it at he?

343
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:11,979
No, no. Tha's my father's
watch. I brought it for good luck.

344
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:14,913
Maybe it's in the truck.

345
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:16,997
No. No, I remember that-

346
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,021
Maybe it's in the truck.

347
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:26,812
Maybe it's in the truck.
Yeah!

348
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:29,312
Yeah, okay.

349
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,771
Hey. If you guys need-
Goodnight Chad.

350
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:35,854
Yeah, yeah, but if-

351
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,062
Goodnight you two.

352
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:41,604
Yeah, goodnight.

353
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:47,521
Something about being in nature.

354
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:55,854
Are you cold?

355
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:58,479
A little.

356
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:11,562
Thanks.

357
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,979
You better get some sleep. It's
going to be a long day tomorrow.

358
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:21,854
What's bothering you?

359
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:26,604
Something was off about that guy Tex.

360
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:35,896
Yeah, I thought so too.

361
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:47,705
If you're still cold, I can
tell Chad and Becky-

362
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,271
No. No.

363
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:53,521
They're finally relaxing like they used to.

364
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,229
Besides. I want to be out here next to you.

365
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:26,747
Get it off! Get it of!
Stand still!

366
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:28,038
I can't find it!

367
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:29,497
Get it off me!
Stand still!

368
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,705
I got it.
Are you sure?

369
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:32,747
I got it. I got it.
Are you sure?

370
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:33,830
Yeah, I got it.

371
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:36,854
Jack, that's a little
much for a spider. Isn't it?

372
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:39,937
You're good.

373
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:43,413
Good morning everyone.

374
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:44,437
Whose hungry?

375
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:48,979
Hey, that's my...

376
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:52,562
Relax man. There's plenty of
this stuff for everybody. Okay.

377
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:59,854
You can share. Be a nice boy David.

378
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,830
Jack. Teriyaki or original?

379
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:05,479
Original.
There you go.

380
00:32:06,187 --> 00:32:08,604
David?
Teriyaki.

381
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:11,288
Ladies?

382
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:12,663
I have my own food.

383
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,497
Dana?
Original.

384
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:18,896
Original. Breakfast is served.

385
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:22,479
This is definitely not original.

386
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:26,187
Alrigh. Let's do this!

387
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:28,747
Don't I look cute?

388
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:31,771
Wow. You look beautiful babe.

389
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:33,312
Thanks babe.

390
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:47,771
Is everyone else ready to go?

391
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,146
Yeah, okay guys.

392
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:53,187
Take your wallet and your phones.

393
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,247
And anything else you don't want stolen.

394
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:58,351
And put everything else
in the truck this time guys.

395
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,187
See, that's what I was talking about.

396
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,979
Don't worry. She's got nothing on you.

397
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:15,622
Bring all your jerkey.

398
00:33:15,646 --> 00:33:16,581
All of it?

399
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:18,271
Unless you want to carry the extra water?

400
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:19,979
I'll be the jerkey.

401
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:55,062
Come on.

402
00:35:25,604 --> 00:35:27,038
Can we take a break?

403
00:35:27,062 --> 00:35:28,705
Is your makeup running?

404
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,413
Shut p.

405
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:33,771
We have been walking. We have
to be at least somewhere close.

406
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:37,896
We've been walking forever.
No. An hour and fifteen minutes.

407
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:39,913
Are you kidding me? That's it?

408
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:40,979
Yeah.

409
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:43,372
How much farther do we have?

410
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:44,413
About five and a half miles.

411
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:46,497
Five and a half miles?
You can do it.

412
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:50,229
Are you kidding me? I'm staying right
here. I'll wait for you guys to come back

413
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:52,705
I think that's a good idea.

414
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:54,247
Come on.

415
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,646
Nope! We are all in this together.

416
00:35:57,146 --> 00:35:59,146
Forward ho!

417
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:03,247
Who gave him coffee?

418
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:04,437
I want some.

419
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:36,312
Would you look at that...

420
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:38,979
Gorgeous.

421
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:52,229
We're witnessing history.

422
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:56,562
It's beautiful babe, but I think
other people have seen this before.

423
00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:00,229
No, I'm not talking about nature, Becky.

424
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:02,674
We got all the way here and
she hasn't taken a selfie yet.

425
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:07,521
Poor Becky.

426
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:15,247
But we should take a picture.
It's so pretty.

427
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:18,271
I hate pictures. I don't care.
Here Becky, take a picture of us.

428
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,437
Alright.

429
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,479
Open your eyes David.

430
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,687
What's that?
Where?

431
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:30,937
Down there.

432
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:33,896
It's gold.

433
00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:40,187
We're rich!

434
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:45,937
Hey! That's-

435
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:48,896
That's my Dad's watch.

436
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,187
But how did it get?

437
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:56,497
It ws that guy at the campsite yesterday.

438
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,413
See, I told you guys he was a criminal.

439
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:01,122
There wasn't even anything
missing from the tent.

440
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:04,146
Well maybe it fell off my wrist when
we were putting the tent together.

441
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:06,632
Then when he was going
through our stuff, he picked it up.

442
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:11,062
But hey. I told you guys.
It's my good luck charm.

443
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:18,021
What is it?

444
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:20,354
Shh.

445
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:22,729
Did you hear that?

446
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:23,979
No.

447
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:28,747
I think we should get out of here.

448
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:31,771
I don't have no argument
with that. Let's go. Yeah.

449
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:33,187
Come on.
Let's go.

450
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:39,396
Come on Jack.

451
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:02,271
I gotta take a piss.
Yeah, me too.

452
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:06,187
Yeah, I have to go too.

453
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,312
Ou guys can go over there.

454
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:13,812
Another stop.

455
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:21,354
Jack!

456
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,062
Shit, Jack!

457
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:28,104
Jack.

458
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:41,354
Jack, what the hell is this?

459
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,830
Should we take them with us?

460
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:45,934
I'm not touching those man.

461
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:50,229
No, no. That's just a prank.
That happens all the time.

462
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:52,604
A prank?

463
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:57,229
It's best to be safe, and let
the sheriff know where it is.

464
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,187
If that's a prank, that's sick.
And by sick, I mean kind of awesome.

465
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:10,479
And you guys give us a hard time aobut
going to the bathroom together.

466
00:40:11,187 --> 00:40:13,830
Anyway. You're not going to
believe what we found back there-

467
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:15,979
Hey! We gotta hurry up.
We're losing light.

468
00:40:19,396 --> 00:40:20,396
Let's go.

469
00:40:25,354 --> 00:40:26,354
What happened?

470
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,330
I don't know what's going on.

471
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:32,354
We need to get back to
the truck and get out of here.

472
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:36,354
But I don't want them to freak out.

473
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:38,146
Okay.

474
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,312
Let's move it people!

475
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:42,747
What's the rush now?

476
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:43,771
Aren't you hungry?

477
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:47,896
Yeah. I guess so.

478
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,146
Okay.

479
00:40:58,937 --> 00:41:00,354
Victory!

480
00:41:04,146 --> 00:41:06,146
Wait. Jack.

481
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:08,229
The truck is gone.

482
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:10,271
What?

483
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:14,979
The truck. It's been stolen!

484
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,538
I can't believe this. We are
in the middle of nowhere.

485
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,562
I mean I can see this happening in
Downtown Phoenix, but out here?

486
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:26,729
I mean, really?

487
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:33,062
It was that guy Tex! He waited for us to
leave, and then he stole the truck!

488
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,896
You forgot to take my watch!

489
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:39,896
How are we gonna get out of here?

490
00:41:41,771 --> 00:41:46,479
And he has my purse! I can’t call
to cancel my credit cards.

491
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:49,437
You didn't take it with you?

492
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:51,812
I didn’t want to carry it.

493
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:56,479
Alright guys. We have to remain calm.

494
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:58,354
We're stuck out here!

495
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:03,830
Maybe for a little while, but we’re next to
the road. The ranger will come by tonight.

496
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,479
And We’ll flag him down.

497
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:10,271
We were going to stay an extra night
anyway. We’ll just all share the tent.

498
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,562
We're going to all fit in the tent.

499
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:17,812
Dana and I, we'll sit in
the chairs and stand guard.

500
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:23,437
I'm sorry. Stand guard? Is there something
you’re not telling us?

501
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:34,687
Alright. Someone stole the truck, there
is nothing we can do about that now.

502
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:39,229
But one thing is for sure, we can’t
go running into the wilderness at night.

503
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:43,021
So we’re going to sit here
and wait for the ranger.

504
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:45,997
Jack. What about the
bloody clothes back there?

505
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,913
Bloody clothes?

506
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:51,771
Yeah, some psychopath chopped some
people up and stole our truck.

507
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:56,372
We peed next to dead bodies?

508
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:58,687
No. No. They're aren't any dead bodies.

509
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:00,038
How do you know?

510
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:01,437
Do you see any?

511
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:02,664
No.

512
00:43:02,688 --> 00:43:05,687
And you were right next to the clothes.

513
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,062
As long as we stick together,
we're going to be fine.

514
00:43:13,812 --> 00:43:15,979
What if the park ranger doesn't come?

515
00:43:18,271 --> 00:43:21,271
Then we will wait until morning,
hike out to the main road.

516
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:24,521
We passed several cars and RVs on
the way in. Someone will pick us up.

517
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:29,562
What about dinner? Did he steal that too?

518
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:34,229
I’m afraid so.

519
00:43:36,604 --> 00:43:38,479
Your hero saves the day.

520
00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:41,021
Gus's Beef Jerkey!

521
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:43,687
Teriyaki, Original Jack.

522
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:46,479
Always prepared baby.

523
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,021
Hey John, talk to me
over here for a minute.

524
00:44:11,771 --> 00:44:14,771
John? Who's John?

525
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,104
Is that like an ex or something?

526
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:22,038
That's my name.

527
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:25,062
That's not your name. It's Jack.
Is it John, or is it Jack?

528
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:29,038
It's John, but Jack is short for John.

529
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:30,062
What?

530
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,396
You've heard of JFK right?

531
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:35,437
President John F. Kennedy. I’m not stupid.

532
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:39,729
Jackie, Robert, his whole
family referred to him as Jack.

533
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:42,604
What?

534
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:50,937
That’s totally made up.
I’m so done with this day.

535
00:44:51,812 --> 00:44:52,979
Are you ready for bed?

536
00:44:53,937 --> 00:44:56,747
I'm beyond tired.
I'm tired too.

537
00:44:56,771 --> 00:44:57,937
Goodnight.

538
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:05,229
Yeah, I think it's time to hit the sack.

539
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:06,562
I'm exhausted.

540
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:12,646
I just want this day to be over.
Wake me up if the ranger comes,

541
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:16,646
Otherwise, I’ll see you in
the morning. Goodnight.

542
00:45:20,812 --> 00:45:22,062
Goodnight.

543
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:37,062
John.

544
00:45:37,146 --> 00:45:38,146
Yeah?

545
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:44,187
Do you think somebody killed those people?

546
00:45:46,937 --> 00:45:47,937
I don't know.

547
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,146
What it is you keep hearing?

548
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:05,979
Sounds like a low growl. Very
quiet.

549
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:08,646
Animal?

550
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:12,937
That’d be my guess. Mountain lion
maybe?

551
00:46:15,604 --> 00:46:18,604
But a mountain lion wouldn’t
stalk a group of humans. They'd...

552
00:46:19,354 --> 00:46:21,997
do everything they could to avoid us.

553
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:23,021
Exactly.

554
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:30,896
The only thing I can think of,
is maybe the animal is rabid?

555
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:33,812
I mean, that's happened before.

556
00:46:34,937 --> 00:46:36,312
A rabid cougar?

557
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:40,729
That's a horror movie.

558
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,187
Yeah.

559
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:49,729
And we're out here in the open.

560
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:11,747
It hasn’t attacked us yet, right?

561
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:13,851
Maybe it's a coyote waiting
to go through our trash.

562
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:21,104
You think we're safe?

563
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:24,729
Yeah.

564
00:47:28,271 --> 00:47:30,229
I'm not falling asleep.

565
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:35,604
And you're not either.

566
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:46,771
Insect?

567
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:52,354
You scared the hell out of me.

568
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:56,354
Sorry. A little jumpy.

569
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:08,979
(screaming

570
00:48:21,937 --> 00:48:24,312
David! Where's David?

571
00:48:24,937 --> 00:48:26,229
David!

572
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:30,937
Jack!

573
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:43,479
Jack!

574
00:48:52,187 --> 00:48:53,187
Jack!

575
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:57,330
Do you see it?

576
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:58,354
No!

577
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:00,229
Let's go. Come on!

578
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,562
Is anybody here?

579
00:49:44,187 --> 00:49:47,187
I'm just stopping by
to check on your folks.

580
00:49:49,562 --> 00:49:53,354
Nice little campsite.
Chairs are facing a fire though.

581
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:55,229
Not looking at the sunrise.

582
00:49:58,354 --> 00:50:01,354
I guess I'll be back later.
I'll be back later to check on you guys!

583
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:16,562
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

584
00:50:17,312 --> 00:50:18,646
We should be looking for David.

585
00:50:19,604 --> 00:50:20,604
He's dead.

586
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:21,854
Chad!

587
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:24,354
What? He's dead isn't he?

588
00:50:25,062 --> 00:50:26,729
We don't know if he's dead.

589
00:50:28,271 --> 00:50:29,812
Did you not see all the blood?

590
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:34,021
Look! Look at you!

591
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:37,229
He's dead!
That's enough! Leave her alone.

592
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:47,812
Come on man. Don't lose you head.

593
00:50:48,604 --> 00:50:52,396
I woke up this morning,
covered in my friends blood.

594
00:50:53,312 --> 00:50:56,312
There's something out there that's
hunting us. How am I supposed to act?

595
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:59,354
Well that girl right there is
covered in her husband's blood.

596
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,604
And we don't even know where the body is.

597
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:06,104
You think she'd even want to see the body?

598
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:09,479
It's probably chewed up, and torn up by
a goddamned wild animal.

599
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:14,687
You're right.

600
00:51:16,021 --> 00:51:18,146
I'm sorry man.

601
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:22,562
Keep it together! We need you.

602
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:32,354
Hey Ashley.

603
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:37,771
I'm sorry.

604
00:51:39,812 --> 00:51:40,896
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

605
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:46,979
Sorry guys.
We'll keep looking.

606
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:20,979
Now we have to go very
quietly and very quickly.

607
00:52:23,396 --> 00:52:24,479
Alright?

608
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:28,812
Yeah? No? Yeah? You ready?

609
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:29,872
If you say so.

610
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:30,937
Alright. Let's go.

611
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:52,372
David's shirt!
Ashley, no!

612
00:52:52,396 --> 00:52:53,396
Dana!

613
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:04,437
Jack, shoot it!

614
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:07,271
I don't see it! I don't see it!

615
00:53:08,437 --> 00:53:09,604
Shoot it!

616
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,229
There's two! Jack, there's two!

617
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:17,122
Shoot it! Shoot them!
Whre is it, I don't see it!

618
00:53:17,146 --> 00:53:18,306
What are you doing? Shoot it!

619
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:22,062
Becky!

620
00:53:25,062 --> 00:53:26,479
Becky!

621
00:53:28,062 --> 00:53:29,062
Dana, Dana!

622
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:32,937
Come on!

623
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:41,021
Hello! The park ranger.

624
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:45,330
Looks the same as this morning.

625
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:46,604
Nothing's changed.

626
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:49,229
It feels different.

627
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:53,354
Someone in here?

628
00:54:17,646 --> 00:54:18,646
Blood.

629
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:22,229
No trail?

630
00:54:27,896 --> 00:54:29,062
Human.

631
00:54:37,062 --> 00:54:39,312
Mary this is Gil. Come in.

632
00:54:42,771 --> 00:54:44,812
Mary this is Gil. Do you copy?

633
00:54:46,896 --> 00:54:47,896
Loud and clear.

634
00:54:49,521 --> 00:54:53,687
We have ourselves here a
possible animal attack at big cat.

635
00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:56,229
Copy that.

636
00:54:59,437 --> 00:55:03,354
Notify the sheriff;s department.
I'm gonna head up the trail.

637
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:06,747
Roger.

638
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,104
Over and out.

639
00:55:17,062 --> 00:55:20,062
Go, go, go.
Is it behind us?

640
00:55:22,604 --> 00:55:25,604
Nah, nah. I don't think it's following us.

641
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:29,104
What are we going to do?

642
00:55:30,896 --> 00:55:33,896
I don't know. But we just
have to keep going. Okay?

643
00:55:36,812 --> 00:55:38,396
We have to go find him.

644
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:43,937
I don't want to leave right here. I think we're safe
here and I don't want to go back out there with them.

645
00:55:44,979 --> 00:55:46,521
Becky and Chad need us.

646
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:51,771
But who is going to protect
us if we get attacked?

647
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:56,229
They would do the same for you Ash.

648
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,997
Look, that's a chance you're
gonna have to take. Alright?

649
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:01,729
I don't think I can do it.

650
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:07,146
Hey, look. You can. do this for Connor.

651
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:12,062
You're all he has left. You can do it.

652
00:56:13,146 --> 00:56:14,479
I'll help you.

653
00:56:17,229 --> 00:56:18,479
Come on.

654
00:56:24,104 --> 00:56:25,937
That’s enough

655
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:28,705
What are you doing?

656
00:56:28,729 --> 00:56:33,229
This trail ends! What happens
when we get to the top?

657
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:37,021
I don't know. We’ll figure
out something out. Okay?

658
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:40,479
We were all supposed to stay together!

659
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:42,913
You’re the one who ran off first!

660
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:48,646
I’m not going any further. All those survival
shows tell you to stay put when you’re lost.

661
00:56:49,354 --> 00:56:54,497
We’re not lost! A man-eating animal somewhere
out there and it's chasing us right now!

662
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:57,521
I don’t care! I’m not moving.

663
00:56:58,687 --> 00:57:02,205
So this is your plan then? You're just going to
stay here until that thing comes and kills us?

664
00:57:02,229 --> 00:57:07,580
No. I’m going stay here and wait for the
others. They can’t be that far behind us.

665
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:10,038
But we don't even
know if they're behind us.

666
00:57:10,062 --> 00:57:13,342
They could havegone in the other direction.
Or for all we know, they could be dead!

667
00:57:14,937 --> 00:57:16,104
No.

668
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:20,562
Stop.
No, no... They’re not-

669
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,663
I'm sorry.

670
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,354
I'm sorry.

671
00:57:25,187 --> 00:57:29,729
What I mean is. They haven't
been behind us the entire time.

672
00:57:31,604 --> 00:57:34,021
Maybe they went off and got sme help.

673
00:57:35,729 --> 00:57:40,705
We have to keep going. That'll buy us more time
for Jack, or the park ranger to come find us.

674
00:57:40,729 --> 00:57:41,729
Okay?

675
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:43,687
Okay?

676
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:48,521
Okay.

677
00:57:49,521 --> 00:57:50,521
Come on.

678
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:55,896
Gil, do you copy?

679
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:00,663
Yeah Mary. Go ahead.

680
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:02,413
What’s your 20?

681
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,080
I’m about a two miles in.

682
00:58:05,104 --> 00:58:09,854
You’re on own for a little while. Sheriff’s
responding to an abandoned van. Possible homicide.

683
00:58:12,104 --> 00:58:15,104
Roger that.
Copy that.

684
00:58:16,104 --> 00:58:18,146
I’ll update accordingly.

685
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:22,271
Over and out.

686
00:58:31,687 --> 00:58:33,622
We need to find David.

687
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:36,646
Hey, we will. Right Jack?

688
00:58:37,104 --> 00:58:38,437
Yeah.

689
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:02,146
We're almost there.

690
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:10,979
Isn't this where we stopped?
What?

691
00:59:11,229 --> 00:59:12,229
To pee?

692
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,979
I don't know. It all looks the same to me.

693
00:59:17,146 --> 00:59:19,396
No. This is it.

694
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:23,229
I want to see them.
See what?

695
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:25,854
The bloody clothes.

696
00:59:27,229 --> 00:59:31,747
Why? Why do you want to see them-
Maybe the left a knife or something

697
00:59:31,771 --> 00:59:34,771
behind to protect ourselves with.

698
00:59:35,146 --> 00:59:38,146
It didn't do them any good. Becky!

699
00:59:45,521 --> 00:59:48,521
See, I told you. Nothing.

700
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:51,771
Now seriously. We have to keep going.

701
00:59:53,062 --> 00:59:56,062
Meu Deus.

702
00:59:57,937 --> 01:00:00,937
I don't want to die like this.

703
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,163
You're not going to die.

704
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,163
Okay.

705
01:00:11,187 --> 01:00:14,187
Seriously, we have to keep going.

706
01:00:14,437 --> 01:00:15,729
I promise.

707
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:19,396
Becky.

708
01:00:20,354 --> 01:00:23,354
Hey, hey. Come on!

709
01:00:25,437 --> 01:00:26,646
Come on.

710
01:01:21,187 --> 01:01:22,354
Stop.

711
01:01:23,771 --> 01:01:24,896
Let's go! What are-

712
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,062
I hear footsteps.

713
01:01:32,854 --> 01:01:39,771
Hey! I’m ranger, Gil, Gil
Rodgers. Are you guys okay

714
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,538
Yeah, yeah. We're alright.

715
01:01:42,562 --> 01:01:45,830
Is that your camp down there?
Yeah.

716
01:01:45,854 --> 01:01:50,687
It’s in terrible shape.
None of you are hurt?

717
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:54,229
No. We're alright. But three
of our friends are missing.

718
01:01:57,771 --> 01:02:00,330
We're being hunted by
a couple mountain lions.

719
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:05,187
You’re mistaken about mountain lions.
They don’t hunt large groups of humans.

720
01:02:06,187 --> 01:02:09,187
Well then what would have dne this?

721
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,812
What's that?

722
01:02:11,062 --> 01:02:13,997
This is my husband David's shirt.

723
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,521
He needs medical attention. Where is he?

724
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:21,229
We haven't found him.

725
01:02:25,104 --> 01:02:28,104
Mary, come in

726
01:02:28,187 --> 01:02:30,163
Go ahead.

727
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:37,187
It looks like large predator has in
fact, been attacking our hikers.

728
01:02:40,979 --> 01:02:45,104
Get that sheriff to send some deputies
down here. And send the medical.

729
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,646
Roger that.

730
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,562
And warn the Apache County rangers as well.
I think-

731
01:02:56,271 --> 01:02:57,580
Gil.

732
01:02:57,604 --> 01:02:58,979
Gil. Do you Copy?

733
01:03:07,146 --> 01:03:09,830
You get a shot. Take it!

734
01:03:09,854 --> 01:03:11,479
I'm planning on it.

735
01:03:16,646 --> 01:03:20,479
That's not a good idea. I think we should
go back to the camp,

736
01:03:20,729 --> 01:03:23,729
Get all your stuff, and head ot of here.

737
01:03:24,062 --> 01:03:26,271
The sheriff will be coming soon.

738
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:41,021
Gil! Come in! If you can here this, get in your
vehicle. The sheriff is warning of extreme danger.

739
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:44,979
He’s headed your way.
Gil!

740
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:50,288
Be careful, there were two.

741
01:03:50,312 --> 01:03:52,913
When we get to that campsite,
get what you need.

742
01:03:52,937 --> 01:03:55,937
Drive back into town,
and leave the rest to me.

743
01:03:56,562 --> 01:03:58,163
Our truck was stolen.

744
01:03:58,187 --> 01:03:59,247
Did you report it?

745
01:03:59,271 --> 01:04:00,913
We haven't had a chance to yet.

746
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,937
I hear that they found an
abandoned truck out on the highway.

747
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:07,521
I'll drive you past it. See if it's yours.

748
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:21,646
Gil!

749
01:04:32,229 --> 01:04:34,038
You see that?

750
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:35,288
What?

751
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:38,312
The glare.
No.

752
01:04:39,854 --> 01:04:42,854
It looks metallic. Maybe glass.

753
01:04:44,104 --> 01:04:46,872
On top. It's got-

754
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:50,937
What is this? Somekind
of homemade contraption?

755
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:55,312
Speakers? And on top.

756
01:04:57,604 --> 01:05:00,038
Some kind of motion detector.

757
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,062
What is-

758
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:09,271
What the hell is going on?

759
01:05:09,604 --> 01:05:11,955
That's the end of that.

760
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:14,205
Is this a forrest-
Is this one of yours?

761
01:05:14,229 --> 01:05:15,646
No ma'am.

762
01:05:17,062 --> 01:05:18,271
Ashley!
Ashley!

763
01:05:32,354 --> 01:05:34,396
What are you doing in our home?

764
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:38,146
This land, it belongs to the state.

765
01:05:38,604 --> 01:05:41,247
No, it belongs to us!

766
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,413
Who's us?

767
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:45,437
The rightful owners.

768
01:05:45,937 --> 01:05:48,937
We can talk about this. You let her go.

769
01:05:49,104 --> 01:05:51,104
No more talking.

770
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:48,687
Go!

771
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:54,229
I'm not leaving you!

772
01:06:55,646 --> 01:06:58,646
Dana, get out of here!

773
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:03,021
Go!
No!

774
01:07:08,896 --> 01:07:09,896
John!

775
01:08:55,896 --> 01:09:01,955
Another gorgeous Arizona day in the books. Days
like today remind those snowbirds why they have a

776
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:07,122
why they have a second mortgage. Forecast for
tomorrow is a high of 78, with a low of 52.

777
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:13,622
We have breaking news from the sheriff’s office: The
suspect has been identified in the brutal murders

778
01:09:13,646 --> 01:09:17,747
of those four hikers and park
ranger in the Superstition Wilderness

779
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:25,247
Eric Kairis was born and raised in Salem, Oregon. He
was convicted of murder in 2017. He was the founding

780
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:31,413
member of the radical group ’Give It Back’, or
GIB. The group is responsible for over 20 deaths

781
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:39,413
in the past 2 years. Kairis was most recently a resident
of the largest psychiatric hospital in the state

782
01:09:39,437 --> 01:09:46,080
of Oregon, until his escape 3 weeks ago.
The incident is still under investigation.

783
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:48,271
The four hikers were on vacation-

784
01:09:56,521 --> 01:10:02,830
My name is Eric Kairis. Yes, I am the founder
of ’Give it Back’. Don’t say GIB, I hate that!

785
01:10:02,854 --> 01:10:09,437
It minimizes our credibility. For all of my
followers and believers, this video is... Canon.

786
01:10:09,854 --> 01:10:13,580
They may have burned our physical network to
the ground, but they have only strengthened

787
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:16,080
our resolve and our cause.

788
01:10:16,104 --> 01:10:21,146
I’m locked in this cage, like our brothers and sisters
around the world. But they will not contain me,

789
01:10:21,271 --> 01:10:29,229
or our message. Humans have had control of our lands for far
too long. Blood is the only message they will understand.

790
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:32,437
They will not give it
back, we must take it!

791
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:43,937
They made it!

792
01:10:45,562 --> 01:10:47,604
So nice to see you again.

793
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:51,812
Welcome children. Come into the light.

794
01:10:52,771 --> 01:10:54,896
All are welcome.

795
01:11:10,271 --> 01:11:12,437
And I want to thank you folks.

796
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:15,729
Can't say I didn't warn you.

797
01:11:16,396 --> 01:11:17,437
Enjoy.
