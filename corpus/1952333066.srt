1
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,865
- Thank you.
- No problem, buddy.

2
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:02,936
Michelle, have your 
heck to the wind ...

3
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:05,019
and drove up to the 
country a day early.

4
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,312
Wanna surprise Ian,

5
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:07,955
spend the long weekend with him.

6
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,622
So, I need you to call Metler ...

7
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,828
tell him his papers 
were filed yesterday ...

8
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:16,235
and everything is fine. I will talk 
to him first thing on Monday ...

9
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,298
morning and call my dentist ...

10
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,563
cancel that appointment and 
re-schedule it for Tuesday afternoon.

11
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,721
And then cancel my meetings 
for the rest of the day.

12
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:24,691
You know what to do!

13
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,881
That is why you are my assistant.

14
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,058
Is there anything else I can ... ?

15
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:30,753
- Hi Louise.
- Hi honey.

16
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:31,913
How is Chicago?

17
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:35,041
Your flight leaves in a couple of 
hours, right? Can't wait to see you.

18
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,602
Yeah, yeah me too.

19
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:40,748
Excuse me, Lou. I am just about
to head into a meeting.

20
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:44,328
I'll see you at the 
house tomorrow, OK?

21
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:47,588
Ya, see ya tomorrow. I'll be 
driving up in the evening.

22
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:51,340
See you then. Bye.

23
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,577
Dearest Louise:

24
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:47,653
I am not spending 
the weekend here ...

25
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:48,999
as we planned.

26
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,647
I have come to a crossroads 
here: marriage.

27
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,546
And I need to go away and 
have some time to think.

28
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:00,999
Sorry I took this in a letter.

29
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:04,504
Please remember to feed the fish.

30
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,418
Remember to feed the fish?

31
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,600
No, no, no ... 
I can't do ... no. Stupid.

32
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:18,293
Um, I am very sorry.

33
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:22,703
You're wonderful and 
I don't deserve you.

34
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,603
- Michelle, listen!
- I don't know what you think of him.

35
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:30,980
His purchase is going forward,
that's what you need to tell him ...

36
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:35,386
over and over again 
until he calms down.

37
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,703
- You should call ...
- No, I am not going to call him myself.

38
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,577
Michelle, there is someone 
inside my house.

39
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,298
Oh, somebody quite romantic.

40
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:52,290
Listen Michelle,
no more calls ...

41
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:54,989
for the rest of the day.
I want you to hold all calls.

42
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:57,928
Looks like I am about 
to have a lot of sex.

43
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,160
Ya, ya, ya. 
Well handle it yourself ...

44
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,755
Ms. Harvard Bachelorette,
that's what I pay you to do.

45
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,835
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

46
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:06,554
Ian!

47
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,141
You came back early.

48
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:20,592
Look at these flowers.
They're just beautiful.

49
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,810
You haven't done this
for me in years.

50
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:27,599
Business meeting 
in Chicago ― my ass.

51
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:36,344
Oh my God. That is sexy.

52
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,220
- What's wrong?
- Please sit down.

53
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,016
- No.
- Please, please ...

54
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,899
- Louise.
- This is great.

55
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,329
Louise,

56
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:09,049
I was in the middle of writing 
it when you got here, so ...

57
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:14,131
it's ... you're a day early. You weren't
supposed to be here till tomorrow.

58
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:19,552
- Please feed the fish?
- No, I crossed that part out,

59
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,389
it wouldn't have made it into
the final letter at all.

60
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,709
What does this mean, Ian?

61
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,772
Louise. I ...

62
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,906
Why are you leaving? 
What do you need to think about?

63
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:28,510
Why can't you think about it here?

64
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:29,859
I'm going to Paris.

65
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:31,404
Paris?

66
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,134
Look, I have been having serious 
doubts about this marriage ...

67
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,660
and I think that ...

68
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,258
No, you are not going, Ian.

69
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:40,126
You're gonna stay right here ...

70
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:41,935
and we are going to work 
through this together,

71
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:45,593
as we always manage to do.
- No, not this time.

72
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:56,944
Who is she?

73
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:01,397
No, this isn't about anybody else.
This is about you, about me, about us,

74
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,604
it's nobody else.

75
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,728
- But there is someone else?
- No, no ... it's ...

76
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,210
Look at your hand 
when you said "No".

77
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:08,492
Why don't you look at your hand?!

78
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,367
Where is your wedding ring?

79
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,021
And why are there flowers everywhere
and petals all over the floor?

80
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,953
Things haven't been 
right between us.

81
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,929
Well, nobody told me that, Ian.
I thought they were beautiful.

82
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,995
And our anniversary 
dinner 2 months ago,

83
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,683
you leaned into me ...

84
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:28,212
took my hand and said: "I'm so happy!"
- Yes I know. I was lying.

85
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,331
- You were lying?
- I was lying.

86
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,160
- You were lying? No, Ian.
- No, I cant, I can't ...

87
00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:34,185
If you were confused 
or unhappy ... ?

88
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:36,593
You decide to tell 
me this in a note?

89
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,783
After 13 years of marriage ...

90
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,116
that's what I deserve?

91
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,313
I can't stand confrontation, 
you know that.

92
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,377
I know it's crappy of me,
I realize it ...

93
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:45,837
but you deserve better.

94
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:47,270
I feel awful.

95
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,754
What am I supposed 
to do then, Ian?

96
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,847
Am I supposed to sit here 
and watch you leave ...

97
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:51,928
and not know why ...

98
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,224
and wait until the 
divorce papers come?

99
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,319
I mean, what kind of 
creep does that?

100
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,790
Are you that kind of creep?

101
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,560
And don't numb-out on me!

102
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:03,624
You are not leaving this house,

103
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,025
until you at least try ...

104
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:09,220
to work things out with me.
You are my husband.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,657
That's the least you can do!

106
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,918
I'm in love with 
someone else, Louise.

107
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:22,295
There, I said it.

108
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:33,453
- Stop packing, Ian.
- No.

109
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,032
I said stop packing.

110
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,113
I'm going to Paris first thing 
in the morning, Louise ―

111
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,706
No, you are not.
You are not going anywhere.

112
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,865
which means I'm very sorry, Louise.

113
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,576
I said stop packing !!!

114
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,932
Uh, fuck!

115
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,562
What the fuck!

116
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:18,749
Have you gone completely insane?!
Louise !!!

117
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:21,284
Calm down Ian, 
you're gonna have an anorism!

118
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,749
- Oh, my head.
- Yeah, oh I know.

119
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:26,895
I'm really so sorry about that.
I really am.

120
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,157
I brought you some water.

121
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:34,485
Fine, I'll drink it myself.

122
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:41,674
Ow, oh, ow, Ian.
Damn tooth ― I got a cavity.

123
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:47,802
Why am I duct-taped 
to a fucking chair, Louise?

124
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,823
Because my love, I have decided 
to keep you here ...

125
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,524
until we can work this out.

126
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:57,398
I don't love you anymore.

127
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,234
Well, then you just 
stay here until you do.

128
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:01,228
That's completely insane!

129
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:01,834
Why?

130
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,784
'Cause my life doesn't work that way.
You can't keep a person hostage ...

131
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:05,886
until they love you.

132
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,186
Oh, come on Ian.
I am sure it's been done before.

133
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:13,987
I love Sara, not you, 
and that's not gonna change.

134
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,659
Sara, who is Sara?

135
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:17,166
She's the person I deeply love,

136
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,711
and you are making her 
look better by the minute.

137
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,440
And I'm sure she'll be hurt 
when you dump her,

138
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:22,672
but she'll live.

139
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:25,423
As a lawyer, you took an oath
to uphold the law,

140
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,265
but I'm pretty sure you are not
upholding the law here.

141
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:29,065
I could make a case for it.

142
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:31,009
Louise, I hate you, and I think
you are a psycho ...

143
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:33,314
and you are gonna be jailed 
and institutionalized.

144
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,007
Yeah, that'll be 
pretty hard to do ...

145
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,843
when you can't 
even move an arm.

146
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:39,760
I mean eventually after I ...
- Yes, after you are free of course.

147
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,943
But by that time 
you won't want to,

148
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,370
because you will love me again.

149
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:47,432
No Sara, no divorce, 
no pressing charges, just love.

150
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:49,116
The way it was supposed to be ...

151
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:51,122
when we first took our vows, 
you remember, Ian?

152
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,559
Yeah, you know, you are right.
Come here, come here.

153
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:06,795
Ok.

154
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:13,472
Yeah, you know it's ...
Yeah, you're right.

155
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:18,836
It really isn't fair for me, 
to just up and leave ...

156
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,691
without giving us a chance 
to work this through.

157
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:28,703
Why don't you un-tape me, sit down
and we'll talk this out, OK?

158
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,409
You won't be un-taped until 
you love me again.

159
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,414
Oh c'mon I love you, I do.
I swear to God.

160
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,572
- You're an atheist.
- I love you.

161
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:39,662
You're my wife.

162
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:42,520
Thank you.

163
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:50,052
Thank you for helping me see what
a stupid thing I was about to do.

164
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:55,370
Yeah. You shocked me 
into reality, you really ...

165
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,993
you really did. 
I love you.

166
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:06,337
- I love you, I love you.
- You are the worst liar, you are.

167
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:09,894
Your pupils grow 
to the size of Pluto,

168
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:12,924
your brow gets all sweaty, you 
can't even look me in the eye.

169
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,614
I love you, Lou. I do.

170
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,615
No, you don't.
You think I'm a psycho,

171
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:21,150
who you want to divorce 
and prosecute.

172
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm not an idiot, Ok?

173
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:23,429
Why don't you let me go.

174
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,596
But that will change, 
my love. You'll see,

175
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:29,425
and we will be happy.
- Let me go you fucking lunatic!

176
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:34,551
- Sara.
- Sara?

177
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:39,400
Sara, I am a hostage here! Sara!

178
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,445
- Hostage up here!
- Shut up!

179
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:43,665
Hostage here, Sara!
Call the police!

180
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,260
Call the poli ...

181
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:58,639
- Sara ... I presume.
- Hi, yes. I'm Sara.

182
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:03,002
- You must be ...
- Louise, Louise ― the wife.

183
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,053
- I thought ― where is ...
- Ian?

184
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:15,126
Well ... sheesh, it's a cliché:
"He is tied up at the moment."

185
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,705
So, come with me.
Let's have a chat.

186
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,999
Gal to gal. 

187
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,877
- Sara?
- Yeah.

188
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,332
Wow! You are very pretty.

189
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:31,393
Thank you. 
You are very pretty too, Louise.

190
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,595
You are like ... Wow!

191
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:38,945
Anyways ... sit down.

192
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:41,397
So ...

193
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:47,108
Congratulations. My husband is
leaving me for you.

194
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,916
I'm so sorry, Louise, I ...

195
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,774
I didn't ― I just fell in love with him.
I didn't mean to. It just ...

196
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,295
No need to apologize.
I'm fine.

197
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:04,607
- Really.
- Really?

198
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,348
I'm so glad, I am so glad,

199
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,361
because I have been feeling 
so much sadness and guilt.

200
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,675
Oh, I'm sorry.

201
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,299
It must have been 
so hard for you, huh?

202
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,237
It was difficult, yeah.

203
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:20,174
Yeah.

204
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,442
Well, there has been 
a change of plans, Sara.

205
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,764
Ian, has decided that he needs 
to stay here with me ...

206
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,737
to go over some final details.

207
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:37,475
Oh! We were supposed leave 
first thing in the morning,

208
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:41,986
and I'd hoped that he was gonna 
meet my family tonight.

209
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:46,596
My father is making 
Chateau Briand and salad,

210
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:47,990
which is a special meal.

211
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:51,413
Oh, I know.
And he told me all about it,

212
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:55,667
and he is very sorry 
that he can't come, but he ...

213
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,295
just wants stay here with me ...

214
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:00,492
and go over the boring details
of our separation, and,

215
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:03,620
he'll meet you at the airport.
He promises.

216
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,153
Huh, disappointed.

217
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:09,298
It's so selfish of me.

218
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:13,770
Listen, I know how you feel.
But I think it's very important ...

219
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:17,006
that, you know ... we go 
over some file-things ...

220
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,830
before he abandons me forever.

221
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:21,514
Sure you understand.

222
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:30,032
- Can I see him? Is he here?
- He's ... doesn't want to see you.

223
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:33,676
He said this to me, 
and I quote verbatim:

224
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:38,238
"If I see Sara right now, 
I won't be able ...

225
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,519
to stay with you 
for 1 more second.

226
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:42,642
I won't be able to do anything,

227
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:44,543
except kiss her madly ...

228
00:15:44,674 --> 00:15:47,240
all over every part of her face,

229
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:52,019
swoop her into my arms,
and run screaming away."

230
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,305
Yeah, that sounds like him.

231
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,387
I am truly sorry because I forced 
him to stay here tonight ...

232
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:02,869
I hope you understand that.

233
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,622
- I do, yeah.
- Yeah, thanks.

234
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:10,494
Can I call him ...
on the phone later?

235
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:13,120
No, I would prefer 
you didn't do that, you know,

236
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,652
out of respect for me.

237
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,121
Kind of the least you can do.

238
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:18,954
But I really want to talk to him.

239
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:21,917
Well, just think of how 
romantic it will be ...

240
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:24,375
when you re-unite 
on the plane to Rome.

241
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,418
Paris.

242
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:30,779
Paris? Paris. 
That's so romantic.

243
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:34,451
Well, I always wanted 
to see Paris with Ian.

244
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,011
Are you Ok, Louise?

245
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:48,571
Thanks for asking, Sara. Not really, 
but I will be. There's hope for me yet.

246
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,740
- Just excuse me.
- Would you just tell him that ...

247
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,430
I'm thinking of him.
And tell him ...

248
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,627
I told him he had 
nothing to fear ...

249
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,493
about coming clean with you.

250
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,653
He should have done it a year ago.

251
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,276
A year ago?

252
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,685
Yes, yeah, probably would 
have been better.

253
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,651
Tell him I am thinking of him?

254
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:16,086
You're thinking of him.
Got it.

255
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,554
Thank you.

256
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:56,506
Oh, dear.

257
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,427
- Alright.
- What did you do with Sara?

258
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,383
I sent her away.
I told her ...

259
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,361
that you would meet 
her at the airport,

260
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:23,355
and that you and I had some 
last details to work through.

261
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,195
She is very pretty,
not so bright though.

262
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,352
Oh, I can't understand 
what you are saying.

263
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,484
Sorry about that.

264
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:35,734
What were you mumbling about?

265
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,572
Sara is exceptionally bright,
you don't know her.

266
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,134
Ah, exceptionally bright?

267
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:41,874
I don't think so.

268
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,588
She introduced me to 
Russian literature.

269
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:47,434
So that's why you were struggling 
through 'Brothers Karamazov'.

270
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:49,519
She is not only beautiful,
she is brilliant.

271
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:52,922
Brilliant, brilliant. She has the kindest 
heart of anyone I have ever known.

272
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,374
I'm sure she is exceptionally 
kind for a home-wrecker.

273
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,785
She's also soulful, Louise.

274
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,503
Yeah, I am sure there is 
nothing bad about her,

275
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,540
that isn't completely wonderful!

276
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,093
And it doesn't matter.

277
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:02,028
By next time this year ...

278
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:03,675
you'll struggle to 
remember her name.

279
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,498
No, by this time next year 
she'll be my wife ...

280
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,716
and you'll locked away 
safe in a loony-bin.

281
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:10,667
No, no, nonsense & blooey, all of it.
No more talking about her.

282
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:14,428
No, we'll talk about how your entire law 
career will be flushed down the drain,

283
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:16,294
once people know what 
a fruitcake you are.

284
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:16,909
Let's talk about that.

285
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,075
- How about we talk about that, Louise?
- As a matter of fact ...

287
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,918
- No, don't tape my mouth ...
- Why don't you just shut up?

288
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,121
No, I got enough of that ...

289
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,234
Louise ...

290
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:28,515
Ian, why don't you just 
shut up for a minute.

291
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,288
I want you to look 
at something, buddy.

292
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:37,765
Do you remember this day?

293
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,943
Do you remember everything 
about this day?

294
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,705
Like I do, huh?

295
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,452
How scared I was?

296
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:49,422
How I almost couldn't go through 
with it? And do you remember,

297
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:51,941
do you remember sitting with 
me in the back of the church ...

298
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:54,547
just holding me?

299
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:57,601
Do you remember the 
promise that you made?

300
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,544
How I never had to be afraid?

301
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,574
Nobody in my life would ever 
love me as much as you did?

302
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:12,878
I promise, you kept saying that over 
and over again: I promise, I promise.

303
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,241
And when the minister 
finally asked you ...

304
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,588
if you would take me as your wife,

305
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:20,620
you said: I do ― I promise.

306
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:24,879
Do you remember the first 
years of our marriage?

307
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,496
The sweetness of it, 
I mean really.

308
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:29,368
The unbearable sweetness 
of it ― that feeling.

309
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,464
We could trick the world;

310
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:34,213
to fight the odds 
and found each other?

311
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,120
Do you remember that, Ian?

312
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:44,472
I have to go to the bathroom.

313
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,432
Do you know if we have 
any Tylenol in the house?

314
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,405
My tooth really hurts me.

315
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:56,409
No.

316
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:01,490
- What's that smell?
- I'm baking you some cookies.

317
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:05,782
Some chocolate-chip cookies ...
are your favorite.

318
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:13,924
Louise, I really have 
to go to the bathroom.

319
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:15,748
You can wait.

320
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:17,631
I've got the fish.

321
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,966
Look at yourself, you're pathetic.

322
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,901
Look what you're stooping to here.

323
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:24,192
This isn't you, 
you are so above this.

324
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:25,567
You are not desperate.

325
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:28,318
You're an accomplished woman, you have 
an amazing career and tons of friends,

326
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,468
and you are sitting here and acting 
like you are a "Big Nothing" without me.

327
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,947
Well, you don't need me,
you don't need me!

328
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:34,372
Don't tell me what I need!

329
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,558
Don't do that!

330
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:38,634
I won't become just another 
single, divorced ...

331
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:41,137
40-something woman, childless,

332
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:45,360
and try "Online Dating Ads" at night 
and watching "Reality Television", Ok?

333
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,189
And I won't get stuck in the past,

334
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,572
wondering whatever happened to ...

335
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:54,843
my best friend, off in Paris
with someone barely out of her teens.

336
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,637
She's 24, actually.

337
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:58,138
I won't get addicted 
to ice cream ...


338
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:00,948
and start feeling sorry for 
myself and gain 30 pounds ...

339
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,310
and get set up with losers
because I refuse to be lonely.

340
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,139
I refuse to go to 
movies by myself.

341
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:10,634
And to deepen my friendship with 
other women in my situation.

342
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,692
And I just refuse 
to be without you!

343
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,048
- I would rather just ...
- What?

344
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:19,392
What, what ... die? 
Would you actually rather die?

345
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:22,457
Let's just say 
I'd rather go to jail.

346
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,425
I'm not gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die.

347
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:36,585
Because everything is just ―
everything is just gonna be fine.

348
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,961
Louise, please just let me go.

349
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,299
No.

350
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,202
Let me go, listen ...

351
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,306
Why don't we just down and ...

352
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:53,367
talk all this out ―
if am all taped up here ...

353
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,087
you know we are not gonna be 
able to work anything out, hm?

354
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,303
No.

355
00:23:59,775 --> 00:24:01,464
Louise, I have to go 
to the bathroom anyw ...

356
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,213
It's gonna get 
really messy, very soon.

357
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:08,964
Look, I promise I won't run away,

358
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:10,609
just like I did that day.

359
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,927
I promise.
I'm not gonna run away.

360
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:18,937
So why don't you just ―
you know ― un-tape me ...

361
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:23,503
now, while it's still in the funny 
stage before it gets too ugly.

362
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:29,719
- Just say it again.
- What?

363
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,531
Just say I promise.

364
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:38,842
I promise.

365
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,211
I promise, Louise.
I won't run away.

366
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,382
I promise just like 
I did that day,

367
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,444
and from the deepest 
part of myself.

368
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:54,320
Jesus.

369
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:08,310
- It's getting all crazy.
- Yeah, well ...

370
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,092
- I am jus' going to get the scissors, Ok?
- Yeah.

371
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:19,967
Alright.

372
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,463
Please, Ian, it's alright.

373
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:29,774
I really used a lot.

374
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,838
Ian, I am really not actually 
not very happy about any of this.

375
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,532
Yeah, I know how it is.

376
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,222
God it's so ― here you go,
pretty good.

377
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:45,367
- Yeah, that's sticky stuff.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

378
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:47,360
Oh God, that feels better.

379
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:54,571
What did you do to 
the phone, Louise?

380
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:56,132
Did you cut the ...

381
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:02,770
I don't love you,
I don't want to be with you!

382
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,241
You're pathetic, you're ugly,

383
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:05,678
and you make me sick!

384
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,765
Psycho freak.

385
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,960
Where are your 
god-damn keys, Louise?

386
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:05,276
Well, I found the Tylenol.
It's helping just a little bit.

387
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:08,279
I'm gonna have to get 
to the dentist next week.

388
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,518
Would you like some 
Tylenol for your head?

389
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:14,352
Jesus! This is really 
happening, Louise?

390
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:17,516
I can please.

391
00:27:18,923 --> 00:27:21,330
I am hoping it's just a bad dream.

392
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:22,732
Me too.

393
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:24,068
You can end it.

394
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:25,768
So can you.

395
00:27:25,998 --> 00:27:28,460
Louise, what do you 
want from me, huh?

396
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,208
My heart just isn't 
in it anymore.

397
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:32,435
I simply don't to be with you.

398
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,652
Would you like a cookie?

399
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:35,967
No.

400
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:36,871
They came out really good.

401
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:39,159
Cookies aren't going 
to do the trick, Lou.

402
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:40,874
Does she make you cookies?

403
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:43,212
No, she doesn't make me cookies.

404
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,784
Where did you go?

405
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:49,875
Just want to know 
where did you go.

406
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:51,345
Did you go to her apartment?

407
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:52,973
Did you go to a hotel?

408
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:55,442
Did you come up here 
without me knowing it?

409
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:58,817
Yes, yes, and yes.

410
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:02,270
It was easier, 
you work so many hours.

411
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:05,818
How did you meet her?

412
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,176
- What does it matter?
- I just want to know.

413
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,591
I met her at my accountant.
She is the receptionist.

414
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,632
She is Murray's receptionist?

415
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:16,913
Then I met her too.
I don't even remember her.

416
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,321
- She's "un-memorable".
- Yeah, well, not to men.

417
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:27,244
She's not just the receptionist.
She is working on her doctorate.

418
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,886
She's gonna be a psychologist.

419
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:39,151
So, how did you first 
ask her out ― I mean ...?

420
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:43,736
- Did you ask her to dinner?
- She asked me, Ok?

421
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:46,732
Yeah, she called a number 
of times before I said "Yes".

422
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:48,702
And at first it was 
just about sex?

423
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,123
At first it's always 
just about the sex.

424
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,563
And then she became 
your best friend?

425
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:56,884
- Well, no.
- No?

426
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,427
Louise, not every relationship 
is the same.

427
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:03,564
You always said all 
you wanted in life,

428
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:05,901
was to be married to 
your best friend ...

429
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,804
and that you were the 
luckiest man in the world ...

430
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:08,920
because you were married 
to your best friend.

431
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:10,286
Yes, I know what I said,

432
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,144
but that's not the way 
every relationship goes.

433
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:13,641
Sometimes you don't want to be 
married to your best friend ...

434
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:15,665
because the passion gets lost.

435
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,174
So you had a lot 
of passion with her?

436
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,207
Oh, will you stop, I am not ...

437
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:24,818
You know, yeah, a truckload.

438
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:26,974
But no intimacy.

439
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:29,555
Oh, oh ― it's a different 
kind of intimacy.

440
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:33,328
What kind of intimacy was it then?

441
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:36,372
A passionate kind of intimacy,
rife with mystery.

442
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:37,749
I don't always know 
what she is thinking.

443
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:39,391
I don't always know 
what she is feeling.

444
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:41,445
I ... constantly discovering things.

445
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:44,674
But you always said that 2 people 
never knew each other better ...

446
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:45,066
than you and I.

447
00:29:45,222 --> 00:29:47,892
That, that we 
understood each other.

448
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,223
- Yeah.
- And you love that.

449
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:53,476
- I stopped loving that.
- Why?

450
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,863
I don't know.

451
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,422
What could be better than that?

452
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,849
Certain things are a lot better.

453
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:02,794
Like sex with a new person?

454
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,039
She needs me, Lou.

455
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:09,202
- Och ― I need you, Ian.
- You haven't needed me for years.

456
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:10,988
You're a "Superwoman".

457
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:12,950
You make more money than I do,

458
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:14,681
you can fix anything.

459
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:16,499
You can bench-press more than me.

460
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:18,014
What do you need me for?

461
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:21,514
Ian, I need you.
I need you so much.

462
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,088
You need someone, not me,

463
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,339
not me in particular.

464
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:29,025
She needs me ― in particular.

465
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,151
Alright, I don't need you.

466
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:35,808
But I love you.

467
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:39,998
- Isn't that better?
- Completely not better, no.

468
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:45,855
Why did you ever love me, Ian?

469
00:30:47,635 --> 00:30:49,155
- I don't know.
- No ...

470
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:51,233
Sure you do.

471
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,718
And I want you to think 
about that while ...

472
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,904
I go get you some cookies.

473
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,576
No, I am not going 
to think about it.

474
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:56,957
Sure you are, Ian.

475
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:00,314
- Would you like some milk?
- I don't want any cookies!

476
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:03,900
I will be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

477
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,933
These are the 
exact same cookies ...

478
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,327
I have been making for you 
all of these years.

479
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:11,494
But these are extra-special,
because I put a "magic spell" on them.

480
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,804
When you eat one, you will 
deeply love me again ...

481
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,142
for the rest of your life,

482
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,754
and beyond.

483
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:20,674
Just kidding.

484
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:23,102
Just have a bite.

485
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:24,677
Just have a bite ― 
lookie ― come on.

486
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:26,866
- You really need to eat at ...
- I don't want it, Louise.

487
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,333
Don't do, please, just don't ...

488
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:37,963
Your mother made me promise 
on her deathbed ...

489
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:39,827
that I would continue to make 
you these cookies ...

490
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:41,234
for the rest of your life.

491
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,685
She said I was the best thing 
to ever happened to you.

492
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:44,644
That until you met me,

493
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,412
that you had no direction
and no purpose.

494
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,520
I picked you up by your 
bootstraps, and gave you a life.

495
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,939
You did!

496
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:53,222
Do you think she would approve ...

497
00:32:53,335 --> 00:32:53,940
of what is happening right now?

498
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:55,657
I don't think she would 
like to see me taped ...

499
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,212
to a toilet.

500
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:57,597
I don't mean that.

501
00:32:57,813 --> 00:32:59,084
I mean, do you think 
she would want ...

502
00:32:59,172 --> 00:32:59,784
you to leave me ...

503
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:01,533
for Murray's receptionist?

504
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,599
What my dead mother thinks I should 
do is no great concern to me.

505
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:05,973
It should be.

506
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,960
What anyone thinks I should do 
is not a big concern.

507
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,646
You could name any 
member of my family ...

508
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:12,267
dead and alive, and tell me that they 
don't agree with what I am doing ...

509
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,255
and I could care less.

510
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:19,975
- Would you like another cookie?
- Not really.

511
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,230
How about some music?

512
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,632
How about some music, Ian?

513
00:33:27,836 --> 00:33:30,073
Oh, this is beautiful.

514
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:33,058
Beautiful.

515
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,138
Oh, God.

516
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:43,811
That's stoopin' low, Louise.

517
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:46,193
We danced to it at ...?

518
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:48,204
Yes, on our wedding, 
I remember.

519
00:33:48,788 --> 00:33:50,548
Seems like a life-time ago.

520
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,113
Right outside this window.

521
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:01,172
You said that was the 
happiest day of your life.

522
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:07,603
Our relationship ending is like a 
death that just 2 people know about.

523
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,964
Our whole life gets lost,

524
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,894
everything we did together.

525
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,418
All the places we travelled,

526
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,614
the fights.

527
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:19,680
The small moments of tenderness.

528
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,928
Don't forget the all the 
failed "In vitro" attempts.

529
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,864
How could you say that to me?

530
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,911
How could you say that to me?

531
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,865
You want to hurt me even more?

532
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:34,570
No, I am just 
remembering everything ...

533
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:35,958
and it wasn't all perfect.

534
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,351
Perfect, who said it was perfect?

535
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,680
You used to say it was perfect,

536
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:41,313
you said it all the time.

537
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:44,785
Aren't we perfect?
God, it was a lot to live up to.

538
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:46,356
It was just too much to sustain.

539
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:49,367
- It was almost like it wasn't real.
- I was real!

540
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:52,006
Yeah, until we stopped 
trying to have a child.

541
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,367
And is that why 
you want to leave me ...

542
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,750
because I didn't have your child?

543
00:34:55,856 --> 00:34:57,689
No, no!

544
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,290
It's what happened after, Louise.

545
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:01,008
You became human.

546
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:03,188
I saw your flaws.
You talk too loud, you know?

547
00:35:03,364 --> 00:35:04,467
You talk over me.

548
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,032
And the sex, 
it became so mechanical.

549
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:07,333
No, no. It didn't!

550
00:35:07,544 --> 00:35:10,971
And ― you were always in denial.

551
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:25,984
Ian, we spent so many 
weekends in this house ...

552
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,423
trying to get pregnant.

553
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:29,954
I counted the meals.

554
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,260
What?

555
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:35,832
When we came up here, sometimes
the meals were so strained ...

556
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:39,989
I would count them.
I hated them.

557
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:43,511
I started counting them to see how 
many of them were left in the day.

558
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,303
You stopped loving me.

559
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,717
I never knew.

560
00:35:52,863 --> 00:35:54,929
You know, I tried to pretend 
it wasn't happening.

561
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:56,789
I thought if I could pretend
it wasn't happening,

562
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:59,226
maybe smell would go away.

563
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,570
And then you met Sara.

564
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,510
And then I met Sara.

565
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:07,852
And you succumbed to her.

566
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:10,087
I succumbed.

567
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,729
I don't believe 
you really love that woman.

568
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:16,917
Not really.

569
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:19,198
You can believe anything 
you want, but ...

570
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:21,879
I'm going to Paris with her.

571
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:24,630
I guarantee you I will be 
on that plane tomorrow.

572
00:36:24,753 --> 00:36:25,877
I still guarantee you won't.

573
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:28,635
And I am going to propose 
that she be my wife.

574
00:36:28,782 --> 00:36:31,177
- Naw, you are not!
- Oh, I certainly am.

575
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:32,921
- No, you are not!
- Yes I am.

576
00:36:33,082 --> 00:36:35,358
And I am telling you now 
there is no way ...

577
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:38,085
Could you please will me alone.
I need to use the bathroom.

578
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:41,396
Not that this isn't fun.

579
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:48,586
Oh, God.

580
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:51,830
Excuse me?

581
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:54,458
Have you ever heard of the 
"Stockholm Syndrome"?

582
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,752
Yes.

583
00:36:56,118 --> 00:36:57,828
Hostage falls in love 
with their captor.

584
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,193
Yes.

585
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:03,246
It's gonna take something 
much bigger.

586
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,148
An act of God, really.

587
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:08,819
Now please, close the door?

588
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,592
Close the door, Louise.

589
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,328
Close it!

590
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:17,756
Close the door!

591
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,838
Lake Kashimi, 
the trip we fell in love.

592
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:26,013
Do you remember?

593
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,512
Oh, your first office.

594
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:33,221
Remember I came by to put 
your name on the door?

595
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,996
- That was nice of you.
- Yeah.

596
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:42,050
- And there ― um ...
- The night I proposed to you.

597
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:45,598
- In front of "El Troubadours".
- Yes.

598
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:47,448
Hm, you said "Yes".

599
00:37:48,506 --> 00:37:49,878
Yes, without hesitation, 
you were sweating,

600
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,546
I felt so bad for you.

601
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:54,078
Well, I was scared you'd say "No".

602
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,552
I said "Yes", 
like 17 times in a row.

603
00:37:58,017 --> 00:38:01,177
- No, this just isn't fair, Lou.
- It is, it is.

604
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:04,289
It's more than fair, it's fact.

605
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:06,566
That was the day 
we painted our house.

606
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,300
- Was that after we got married?
- No, no, it was just before.

607
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,243
Do you remember, Ian?

608
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:24,665
Turn it off, Louise.

609
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,524
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yeah, but I am finished.

610
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:29,589
It doesn't matter 
what you show me.

611
00:38:29,702 --> 00:38:31,446
We are not those people anymore.

612
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:32,344
Oh, yes we are.

613
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:33,877
None of the slides 
you have shown me,

614
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,519
are from the last 10 years.

615
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:36,825
I mean, where are those slides?

616
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:37,965
We don't have them.

617
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:39,785
Whatever we had 
that was so special,

618
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,033
just doesn't exist anymore.

619
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:44,218
We just need to make more slides.

620
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:46,413
No, no more slides, no.
No more anything.

621
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:47,495
No more life together.

622
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:50,793
In fact from this moment on I just 
gonna scream and be as unpleasant ...

623
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:51,877
as possible ...

624
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:54,540
until you let me fucking go!

625
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:56,589
Ian, stop.

626
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:59,329
She is a lunatic!

627
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,931
- Help, help!
- Stop it, Ian!

628
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:16,624
If you can hear me,

629
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:19,502
I am a hostage here taped
to a toilet!

630
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,562
Help!

631
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:27,906
Please come and help me!

632
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,440
Hel ...

633
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,687
You look very nice, Louise.

634
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:35,225
Thank you.

635
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:38,613
I haven't seen you in a sexy 
dress in quite a long time.

636
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,992
Doesn't change things of course?
What is the guitar for?

637
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:49,274
I'm gonna play and sing the song.

638
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:50,784
Please don't.

639
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:55,104
I am going to serenade you,
like we did when we first met,

640
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:55,891
and you are going to like it.

641
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:58,299
God, I'm so embarrassed 
for you right now.

642
00:39:58,422 --> 00:40:00,455
Will you just listen, Ian!

643
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:02,245
Oh, God, no, no ...

644
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:26,424
Louise, this is beyond.

645
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:29,472
It's just so not working,
put the guitar away.

646
00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:31,635
Shit! How does it go? Wait.

647
00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:49,469
Well, I would applaud,
but you made that impossible.

648
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,623
You could applaud with your face.

649
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,877
Does it look like 
I'm applauding with my face?

650
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:57,464
No.

651
00:40:57,597 --> 00:41:00,154
You knocked me out cold 
and you taped me to a toilet.

652
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:03,397
Your romance is 
completely lost on me.

653
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,751
I mean, it's more like torture.

654
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:10,189
That's gonna take a miracle.
Nothing less.

655
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,466
And since we both know the odds of 
something other-worldly happening here,

656
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:15,283
Why don't you let me go?

657
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,131
No.

658
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:23,631
- Louise, just give up.
- I won't.

659
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:08,100
How are you doin'?

660
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:11,635
Bored and angry. I wanna wring 
your fucking neck, same as before.

661
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:13,333
Just checking.

662
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:15,701
Listen, I am gonna be going 
to the market in town,

663
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:18,364
'cause I'm gonna make you a 
really fancy romantic dinner.

664
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:19,491
Any request?

665
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:22,385
Could you get me my cell-phone
and then why don't you drop dead.

666
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:23,821
You don't mean that, baby.

667
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:26,502
The only way I would eat your 
fancy romantic dinner ...

668
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:29,121
is if you would force-feed
it down my throat.

669
00:42:43,178 --> 00:42:46,096
Help!

670
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,482
Help.

671
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:28,218
994, 995 ...

672
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:35,691
996, 997, 998, 999 ...

673
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:58,437
Up here, help!

674
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:09,254
Help!

675
00:44:09,437 --> 00:44:10,936
Help!

676
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:26,135
Help!

677
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:36,195
Hello.

678
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:41,177
Are you there? Help!

679
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,172
Help ...!

680
00:46:04,338 --> 00:46:06,910
Please shut the fuck up.
I am trying to rob you.

681
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:09,004
What?

682
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:11,772
I said shut up or I'll bash 
your stupid head in.

683
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:15,759
Talk about an easy target.

684
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:18,868
Coming to your house and the owner
is already tied up for you.

685
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:21,635
That's a beautiful, 
beautiful thing.

686
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,697
Ah, proof of a higher power 
if you ask me.

687
00:46:25,543 --> 00:46:27,385
You are never going 
to get away with this.

688
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:28,744
I told you to shut up, man.

689
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:34,223
Thank you.

690
00:46:55,997 --> 00:46:57,375
Excuse me, sir,

691
00:46:57,784 --> 00:47:00,145
do you happen to have 
any cash on you?

692
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:02,055
No, I don't.

693
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:08,622
- You don't have any cash?
- No, I have no cash.

694
00:47:15,526 --> 00:47:17,654
You sure you don't have any cash?

695
00:47:19,162 --> 00:47:20,311
God!

696
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:27,171
- It's in my wallet in my pants.
- Wallet in your pants?

697
00:47:29,384 --> 00:47:31,022
Look at you, man.

698
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:33,408
You're taped to a fucking toilet.

699
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:40,191
Not that I care really, 
but who did this to you?

700
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:45,384
- My wife.
- Pussy, that's perfect!

701
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:46,871
Holy shit!

702
00:47:47,008 --> 00:47:49,793
Your fucking wife taped 
to a goddamn toilet.

703
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:52,352
What a day you are having, huh?

704
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,023
You must feel pretty humiliated.

705
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:56,273
Yup.

706
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:58,775
See, here is the difference 
between you and me, man.

707
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,967
Whenever I get the urge 
to get married,

708
00:48:01,494 --> 00:48:06,230
I grab my balls and I squeeze them
until I can't feel my legs,

709
00:48:06,437 --> 00:48:08,392
and then it just passes.

710
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:15,092
- What did you do to her?
- Excuse me?

711
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:17,647
Your wife ― to make her tape you to a toilet 
you must have done something to her.

712
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,134
Well, that's none of your business.

713
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:22,970
I am so interested in 
human nature, like ―

714
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:26,742
what makes people do 
the things that they do?

715
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:29,663
My girlfriend thinks that 
I'll be a philosopher.

716
00:48:29,691 --> 00:48:32,469
I got a stereo about "Love".
Do you wanna hear it?

717
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:32,983
Ah, no.

718
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:35,694
I think that love 
is an experiment ...

719
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:40,129
by a higher power. Call it God
 or whatever you want, but ...

720
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,932
I think it's still being worked out.

721
00:48:42,028 --> 00:48:42,847
You know, the kinks.

722
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:46,201
It's not complete,
it's like a test.

723
00:48:46,788 --> 00:48:48,002
Brilliant.

724
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,220
Listen to me. If love is a test,
then you are failing, Ok.

725
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,998
And in the grand-scheme of things 
that makes you a failure.

726
00:48:54,137 --> 00:48:55,876
No, that does not make me a failure.

727
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:57,800
You promised this woman ...

728
00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:00,105
that you would love her for 
the rest of your life, right?

729
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:02,706
And clearly you 
are failing at that.

730
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:05,882
You failed her, yeah man, 
you are a failure.

731
00:49:06,004 --> 00:49:08,733
Who are you to judge me?
You are a criminal.

732
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,922
Fuck you, man,
I am an honest person.

733
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:16,625
I never pretend to be 
anything I'm not.

734
00:49:16,806 --> 00:49:19,045
And I would never promise 
anyone the moon ...

735
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:22,276
and then mean only, until I am 
tired of giving you the moon.

736
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,718
Never.

737
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:24,763
So you think about that ...

738
00:49:24,773 --> 00:49:27,535
while I'm loading your 
belongings into my van.

739
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:30,205
Pussy loser.

740
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:37,128
- Who the fuck is that?
- Louise.

741
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:38,641
Ah, shit!

742
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:41,467
Oh, no.

743
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:43,619
Hello, my love!

744
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:45,757
I'm home.

745
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:56,880
Please, God, don't hurt her!

746
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:04,016
Don't hurt her!

747
00:50:20,055 --> 00:50:21,354
Oh, my God, is she dead?

748
00:50:21,572 --> 00:50:23,254
She definitely looks dead.

749
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,220
What did you do to her?

750
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,562
What did you do to her?

751
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,801
Ah, I just made it very, very quiet.

752
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:33,343
It was fun. 
Want me to do it to you?

753
00:50:34,062 --> 00:50:35,250
You know what we need?

754
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:39,901
I wished we had matching toilet, say, 
for two. That would be pretty funny.

755
00:50:42,003 --> 00:50:45,169
Shit, nice tit's.

756
00:50:45,353 --> 00:50:46,672
Mind if I squeeze 
them a little bit?

757
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:49,877
- Don't you touch her!
- Or what?

758
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:54,651
- What, are you gonna urinate on yourself?
- I'll kill you, I swear to God.

759
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,879
There an escape route that way.

760
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:03,183
- Stop it!
- I would never get sick of these.

761
00:51:07,224 --> 00:51:09,836
When is the last time 
you touched these tit's?

762
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,836
Fuck, she is perfect, man.

763
00:51:14,045 --> 00:51:16,289
You lucky bastard.

764
00:51:17,053 --> 00:51:19,450
Oh, God, what I would do to you.

765
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:23,436
Shit, lucky fuck.

766
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:37,482
I don't think he'll kill us 
because we can't see his face.

767
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:47,283
I don't care about anything 
we own in this house, I mean.

768
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,060
It sounds like he is just taking 
everything that's not strapped down.

769
00:51:57,104 --> 00:52:00,912
I hope he doesn't take that ...

770
00:52:01,002 --> 00:52:03,631
silverware set your 
mother left us.

771
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:05,483
That antique set,

772
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:08,289
wished we had left 
that in the city.

773
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:12,476
You know?

774
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:19,000
There is that expensive painting
that we invested in.

775
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:23,471
What was the artist's name?
Kamano Suki Kamijoto.

776
00:52:24,396 --> 00:52:27,831
Yeah, I hate that painting.

777
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:30,482
I don't care if it's 
worth 20 grand, I mean ...

778
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:34,289
It was made by a 
third-grader I think.

779
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,402
What did you say that 
reminded you of the rain?

780
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:42,235
One of the reasons I bought it was to make 
you happy and to remind you of the rain.

781
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:48,684
Oh my God, look at us, Louise.

782
00:52:49,924 --> 00:52:51,901
It's ridiculous.

783
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:57,173
For all I know this is how it's gonna end 
for us right here in this bathroom ...

784
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,564
with the wallpaper I hate.

785
00:52:58,763 --> 00:53:01,654
Why the hell did we ever not 
take this wallpaper down?

786
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:16,270
I do remember that day.

787
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,805
In the coatroom of the church when I was 
holding you and I was just rocking you.

788
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:25,286
When I was rocking you 
back and forth.

789
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:29,366
And you had dust all 
over your wedding-gown.

790
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,618
You looked so beautiful.

791
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:40,593
I was terrified.

792
00:53:42,183 --> 00:53:43,807
I was terrified.

793
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,794
It's not your fault, Louise.

794
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:53,846
It's not your fault.

795
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,877
You couldn't have children, and I
started hating my life, hatin' ...

796
00:53:58,007 --> 00:53:59,876
my boss, hatin' the 
advertising industry,

797
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:01,844
hating the apartment,
hating this house.

798
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:04,111
Everything we bought that 
we thought we wanted ...

799
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:06,157
just hating everything.

800
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,607
Yeah, and I started feeling like a 
big miserable bastard, 'cause we ...

801
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:13,053
you know, some people have 
nothing and there we were,

802
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:16,180
we could buy stupid 
expensive paintings.

803
00:54:17,405 --> 00:54:19,429
Some people have nothing.

804
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:24,513
Say something, Louise.
Tell me about your crazy job,

805
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:27,066
tell me about your 
hectic schedule.

806
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:27,824
Complain for me, Louise.

807
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:30,177
Just say something, please.

808
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:32,000
Come on, Louise.

809
00:54:32,137 --> 00:54:34,336
Don't leave me alone 
here in this bathroom.

810
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:38,523
Wonder if I am going to die. Don't
leave me alone, Louise, come on.

811
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:41,980
Just say something please.
C'mon, I'll listen, I'll listen.

812
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:48,804
What the fuck.
Is he having a party here now?

813
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,561
Oh, shit!

814
00:54:56,742 --> 00:54:58,572
What a fucking looser.

815
00:55:08,643 --> 00:55:13,156
I know what I am, Louise.
I am a nothing.

816
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:18,499
And I don't stand 
for anything anymore.

817
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:25,061
I'm just a loser 
taped to a toilet.

818
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,681
And it would be poetic justice 
if this is where I died.

819
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:44,044
You didn't marry this man, Louise.

820
00:55:46,964 --> 00:55:50,336
Why do you think 
I wanted to go to Paris?

821
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:55,706
I had this romantic idea of myself you know 
that I could maybe be a hero to somebody again.

822
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:02,895
But look at me, I am a joke.

823
00:56:04,805 --> 00:56:07,436
And you didn't marry a joke.

824
00:56:08,127 --> 00:56:12,158
You married somebody 
who had dreams you know who ...

825
00:56:12,521 --> 00:56:15,000
promised you the world,

826
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:20,848
and look what you ended up with,
someone who lied to you,

827
00:56:20,984 --> 00:56:23,104
who deceived you,

828
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:27,838
who couldn't protect 
you in the end.

829
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:32,577
A loser on the toilet.

830
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,745
I'm sorry, Louise.

831
00:56:39,532 --> 00:56:43,948
I'm ― I'm so so sorry.

832
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,206
3,2 ...

833
00:57:08,527 --> 00:57:10,876
Quiet, quiet, Jesus.

834
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:14,784
Sorry, about the rug.

835
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,718
Sorry, about your rug.

836
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,352
How do you do that?

837
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:27,516
How do you do that?

838
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,512
Hello, is anybody there?

839
00:57:50,003 --> 00:57:51,655
Ian?

840
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,738
- Ian, my only God, where are you?
- Louise, Louise.

841
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:59,031
Louise, Louise, Louise ...

842
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,593
Louise, we're in the bathroom,

843
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:09,608
and we are being robbed.

844
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:11,135
Are you Ok?

845
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,141
I can't move my arms and my legs.

846
00:58:14,606 --> 00:58:16,289
You're taped, Lou.

847
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:17,828
Can you stand?

848
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:21,267
I don't know, I am gonna ...
I'm just gonna try.

849
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:27,738
See if you can go over to the light
switch, rub against it, and turn it on.

850
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:33,319
God, my hands hurt, and my 
tooth is throbbing on some mess.

851
00:58:33,423 --> 00:58:38,367
I know, I know ...
I want to see your face.

852
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:44,568
There you are.

853
00:58:45,198 --> 00:58:47,002
I'm so sorry, Ian.

854
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:50,726
Nah, it's Ok. 
It's not your fault.

855
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:53,586
- Lou, try the door.
- What?

856
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:57,618
Try the doorknob, maybe you 
can escape to the back.

857
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:04,268
Can't get a grip.

858
00:59:06,182 --> 00:59:07,546
Shit!

859
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,659
Did he touch you?

860
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:23,362
No, he just ... 
I came home and he ...

861
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,894
Everything was gone. All our 
stuff was all over the floor ...

862
00:59:30,058 --> 00:59:31,950
in garbage bags and then he ...

863
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:36,834
he jumped me, and then he 
smashed my head into the ground.

864
00:59:37,305 --> 00:59:39,534
And I just don't remember 
anything after that.

865
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:41,148
I'll kill him.

866
00:59:41,902 --> 00:59:43,532
Ian, I'm so ashamed.

867
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,321
I'm so ashamed what I did to you.

868
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:49,296
No, no, no. I'm ashamed.

869
00:59:49,447 --> 00:59:51,826
I'm ashamed what I did to you.

870
00:59:55,201 --> 00:59:57,137
Do you think he will kill us?

871
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,332
I don't know, come sit next to me.
I want you to sit next to me.

872
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,253
Why?

873
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,995
I just want you 
to be next to me, Lou.

874
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,326
Maybe we'll only have 
an hour left together,

875
01:00:15,517 --> 01:00:17,159
maybe 15 minutes.

876
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:19,919
Let's talk this through.

877
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,703
Let's work our marriage out,

878
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,007
even if it's for only 15 minutes.

879
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:27,286
Are you just saying that because 
you are taped to a toilet?

880
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:31,866
I have had a lot of time 
to think about this.

881
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:34,917
And I don't want to fail you.

882
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:39,032
I'm pretty sure I still love you.

883
01:00:39,246 --> 01:00:41,544
Sure, I'm gonna 
kill you sometimes.

884
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:43,157
Like all day today?

885
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:47,356
Hello, yeah, 'cause 
you make me crazy.

886
01:00:47,621 --> 01:00:50,640
Just talk-talk-talk over me.

887
01:00:50,722 --> 01:00:54,880
And, you are so opinionated,
and sometimes it makes me numb.

888
01:00:55,142 --> 01:00:59,524
I won't do that anymore. I won't talk 
over you, and have opinions, I promise.

889
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:02,556
Naw, you can have opinions.

890
01:01:02,872 --> 01:01:05,020
You should quit your stupid job.
You are so much happier if you ...

891
01:01:05,086 --> 01:01:06,305
just quit your stupid job.

892
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:08,585
You hate working at that company.

893
01:01:09,325 --> 01:01:12,597
You're right. I should quit.

894
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,751
I should quit, and I should take the 
money I have saved and should open up ...

895
01:01:16,891 --> 01:01:18,184
my own company.

896
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:20,325
My clients they'd would follow me.

897
01:01:20,489 --> 01:01:22,744
Yup, that's a beautiful idea.

898
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:24,976
We should keep trying 
to have a child.

899
01:01:25,037 --> 01:01:26,934
We could even adopt.

900
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:34,432
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

901
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:38,159
Not just because you 
are taped to a toilet?

902
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:40,775
I mean it.

903
01:01:42,387 --> 01:01:44,782
And I need to start romancing 
you a little more,

904
01:01:45,013 --> 01:01:46,440
just like I did when we 
first were married.

905
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:48,040
I miss those days, Lou.

906
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:52,121
Every day you would look 
all sexy for me, and ...

907
01:01:53,783 --> 01:01:55,627
You called me ugly.

908
01:01:55,729 --> 01:01:57,771
You are not ugly.

909
01:01:58,323 --> 01:02:01,041
You are a beautiful woman.

910
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,773
You are gonna make me for a child.

911
01:02:03,132 --> 01:02:04,497
I'm not leaving you.

912
01:02:04,698 --> 01:02:08,084
- You had an affair.
- People have affairs.

913
01:02:08,094 --> 01:02:09,194
Men.

914
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:14,613
I'm going to make 
it up to you, Lou.

915
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:16,220
I promise.

916
01:03:02,668 --> 01:03:04,700
The light just blew.

917
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,471
Better to see you 
in the moonlight.

918
01:04:15,074 --> 01:04:17,300
Ian, open the door!

919
01:04:19,281 --> 01:04:21,071
I'm serious!

920
01:04:27,995 --> 01:04:29,839
Who are you?

921
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:32,727
Shit!

922
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:35,870
Muah, I guess they made up.

923
01:04:36,341 --> 01:04:39,683
Ian, what is going on?

924
01:04:39,902 --> 01:04:42,412
Oh, please, c'mon, don't hurt her!

925
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:44,879
Oh, please don't hurt her!

926
01:04:45,097 --> 01:04:48,193
Why? What are you going to do 
about it? Hand-tie the man?

927
01:04:51,007 --> 01:04:53,614
Hope nobody else shows up. 
We're running out of tape.

928
01:04:53,842 --> 01:04:56,147
We only have one roll.

929
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:58,860
Haven't you gotten 
everything you wanted?

930
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,926
Why don't you just leave already?

931
01:05:02,404 --> 01:05:04,912
Look at that sexy, 
kinky bondage couple.

932
01:05:05,182 --> 01:05:07,176
You guys are into 
some weird shit.

933
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,982
- Please just let us go.
- Let me think about that.

934
01:05:18,323 --> 01:05:20,186
No, to this side.

935
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:25,487
- Hey, don't you, hey!
- Hey!

936
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,000
Actually I prefer the older one.

936
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:33,370
The younger one really reminds me 
of my whiny bitch girlfriends.

937
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:36,874
But, aren't you beautiful, huh?

938
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:39,318
C'mon, how have you been?
What is your name?

939
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:40,105
Louise.

940
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:42,859
Louise, stop, stop it!

941
01:05:43,394 --> 01:05:50,017
I find you beautiful, I do, I do ...
every pore, every line, every curve.

942
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:54,662
You deserve better than him, You know that? 
He doesn't know what to do with you.

943
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,144
God, I like you this way.

944
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,727
Hey, leave her alone!

945
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:07,940
Please, I do whatever you want!

946
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:13,614
- What are you doing, honey?
- Why ― you bitch.

947
01:06:15,908 --> 01:06:17,749
Coming, sweetness!

948
01:06:44,684 --> 01:06:49,520
Sara, calm down, calm down!

949
01:06:49,704 --> 01:06:52,085
He is gonna kill us.
We're gonna die.

950
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:55,235
And we are going to spend 
our last moments on earth ...

951
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:56,666
with your stupid ex-wife.

952
01:06:57,153 --> 01:07:00,297
Um ... we're still married.

953
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,025
We are not going to die.
Please calm down.

954
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:05,236
Oh, my God!

955
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:10,394
Why was she sitting on your lap?

956
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:13,236
You didn't show up 
at the airport ―

957
01:07:13,435 --> 01:07:17,376
I was so ANGRY!
I drove straight here.

958
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:19,893
Ok ... Sara, Sara, 
your gonna have to really ...

959
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:25,005
Sara, try to calm yourself.
We are just being robbed here.

960
01:07:25,186 --> 01:07:27,356
Oh, God, they taped 
you to the toilet?

961
01:07:27,554 --> 01:07:31,266
- No, I did that.
- What?

962
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:32,871
It's a long story, doesn't matter.

963
01:07:33,064 --> 01:07:34,898
Ian.

964
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:38,183
Are you reconciling 
with your wife?

965
01:07:40,115 --> 01:07:40,969
Yes, he is.

966
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,495
I didn't ask you.
I asked him.

967
01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:51,733
Ian, just tell her!
Get it over with.

968
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:58,423
Sara, I am really 
very sorry about this.

969
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:02,036
No, you don't love her, Ian.
You love me.

970
01:08:02,468 --> 01:08:06,788
- I'm your little Russian bobo!
- She's your little Russian bobo?

971
01:08:07,598 --> 01:08:09,659
They are going to kill us!

972
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:11,547
We have to remain calm!

973
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,948
I wasn't talking to you!

974
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:17,253
I was talking to my boyfriend.

975
01:08:17,701 --> 01:08:18,658
I don't care what you think.

976
01:08:18,834 --> 01:08:20,092
I care what he thinks.

977
01:08:20,572 --> 01:08:23,881
Oh, have you seen this?
Check this out.

978
01:08:24,006 --> 01:08:26,475
I don't know, it must 
have cost him $10,000!

979
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:29,829
You spent $10,000 
on a bracelet for her?

980
01:08:30,124 --> 01:08:31,007
It was about $3,000 ...

981
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,733
Yeah he did, because he 
is in love with me.

982
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:45,734
Ok, please, please ...!

983
01:08:45,877 --> 01:08:46,887
This isn't helping, please!

984
01:08:47,006 --> 01:08:49,914
We are in dangerous situation here!

985
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:51,597
Please!

986
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,256
Now listen, Sara!

987
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,463
He didn't use that much tape on you,
why don't see if you can free your hands.

988
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,572
I'm not moving, Ian, 
until you tell your wife ...

989
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,308
that you are leaving her forever.

990
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:06,220
Can we, please, 
just work all that out later?

991
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:07,696
We are in danger.

992
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:11,446
Just tell her, tell her, Ian, 
and I will do whatever you say.

993
01:09:13,006 --> 01:09:15,292
Fine, if that's all it takes?

994
01:09:15,362 --> 01:09:17,489
Louise, I'm leaving you for Sara.

995
01:09:18,216 --> 01:09:18,470
Fine.

996
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:20,358
And he is not just saying 
that to shut me up!

997
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:22,056
And he is saying it 
because it's true!

998
01:09:22,248 --> 01:09:24,320
And believe me, 
however this works out,

999
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:26,535
we will be in Paris 
together next week ...

1000
01:09:26,593 --> 01:09:29,076
and you will be crying 
to your girlfriends.

1001
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:31,149
Stop!

1002
01:09:32,805 --> 01:09:36,883
Please try freeing yourself.

1003
01:09:46,012 --> 01:09:48,953
- I can't.
- Try harder.

1004
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:51,498
You know what? 
I said I can't.

1005
01:09:54,253 --> 01:09:55,820
Louise, will you please 
just go and help her?

1006
01:09:55,883 --> 01:09:57,831
- I don't want to touch her.
- Louise!

1007
01:09:58,374 --> 01:10:00,100
Fine.

1008
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,856
Oh God, it's not working, Ian!

1009
01:10:08,923 --> 01:10:12,379
Oh, I hate you, Ian.
I wished I had never met you!

1010
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,959
Do you hear that?

1011
01:10:24,674 --> 01:10:26,809
I think they are leaving.

1012
01:10:30,348 --> 01:10:33,363
He is riding away on a lawnmower.
Sara! Sara!

1013
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:37,088
Did you see any kind of vehicle like
from a lawn company or anything?

1014
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:38,467
I was pretty angry ...

1015
01:10:38,544 --> 01:10:40,065
and upset when I got here, Ian.

1016
01:10:40,144 --> 01:10:46,711
So I ... I think, yeah maybe 
I saw a van, and a car or two.

1017
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:47,335
I don't remember.

1018
01:10:47,616 --> 01:10:49,627
A van?

1019
01:10:49,694 --> 01:10:52,722
Yes, I saw a van, an unmarked van.

1020
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:55,471
Doesn't our lawn company 
have a company van?

1021
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:58,368
I'm trying to remember, 
I don't know, I mean ...

1022
01:10:58,444 --> 01:11:02,411
Yes, I ... they do. As a matter 
of fact I'm sure they do.

1023
01:11:02,457 --> 01:11:03,875
So, who are these guys?

1024
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:06,906
I don't know, I didn't think we had 
anyone working on our lawn ...

1025
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:07,854
until next month.

1026
01:11:07,924 --> 01:11:10,998
Some strange guy shows up 
and starts mowing our lawn.

1027
01:11:11,094 --> 01:11:13,470
Well, maybe that's how 
he operates, you know?

1028
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:16,588
Maybe he just stakes out empty 
houses during the week ...

1029
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:20,276
and robs them maybe ... and he just 
didn't count on finding us here.

1030
01:11:20,344 --> 01:11:22,919
Well, lets listen and 
see if they're gone.

1031
01:11:25,357 --> 01:11:27,559
I don't hear anything.

1032
01:11:27,934 --> 01:11:29,426
No?

1033
01:11:30,968 --> 01:11:33,169
They didn't kill us.

1034
01:11:35,381 --> 01:11:37,852
They just left!

1035
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:43,673
Yeah, they just left.

1036
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:46,636
They just left.

1037
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:50,448
Look, I just need to know right now 
whether or not you are going back ...

1038
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,887
to your ugly fucking wife?

1039
01:11:56,037 --> 01:11:58,724
Look honey, this is not 
the time to do anything,

1040
01:11:58,775 --> 01:12:03,288
but figure out how to get free.
We've been tied up all night.

1041
01:12:05,435 --> 01:12:07,827
May I have a moment 
alone with Ian, please?

1042
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:09,531
Where do you expect me to go, hon?

1043
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:10,857
Oh, I don't care.

1044
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:13,003
Why don't you get 
in the shower ...

1045
01:12:13,065 --> 01:12:14,677
and hum yourself a little tune,

1046
01:12:14,755 --> 01:12:17,401
so I can have a moment 
alone with him?

1047
01:12:23,392 --> 01:12:28,138
- Please?
- Fine.

1048
01:12:49,268 --> 01:12:51,834
I love you, you fool.

1049
01:12:54,094 --> 01:12:56,238
Ok, I understand that.

1050
01:12:58,581 --> 01:13:00,681
Ok, I understand that?

1051
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:03,089
That's what you're gonna 
say to me right now?

1052
01:13:03,768 --> 01:13:05,573
My wife's humming in the shower.

1053
01:13:05,656 --> 01:13:07,146
What do you expect me to say?

1054
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:10,210
Oh Ian, I could have taken anyone.

1055
01:13:10,496 --> 01:13:11,274
Anyone!

1056
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:15,834
Fernando, the guy from the gym,
Dr. Cohen,

1057
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:17,312
even my dermatologist.

1058
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,958
Fred, the bank guy, anybody ... 
but I chose you.

1059
01:13:21,046 --> 01:13:22,223
I know, I know.

1060
01:13:22,654 --> 01:13:25,257
You make me feel smart and sexy ...

1061
01:13:25,336 --> 01:13:26,217
and strong and beautiful.

1062
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,933
I wanted to go to Paris with you.

1063
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,297
Ian, I wanted to spend 
my life with you,

1064
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:34,001
and I don't think just because 
we are experiencing this little ...

1064
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:37,001
blip that anything should change.

1065
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:44,544
Yeah, you know, I got a 
lot of sorting out to do.

1066
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:47,497
Sara, I'm sorry.

1067
01:13:47,693 --> 01:13:50,044
It's not so simple anymore.

1068
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,532
You are forgetting it.
How could you forget?

1069
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:56,534
I'm not forgetting.

1070
01:13:58,157 --> 01:13:59,931
Please don't forget.

1071
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:04,903
Ok, been more than a minute.

1072
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:07,710
Ok.

1073
01:14:07,786 --> 01:14:09,458
Are you feeling any calmer?

1074
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:13,511
No! This is an absolute 
nightmare! No!

1075
01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:17,082
Should've just gotten on the 
plane to Paris and gone alone.

1076
01:14:17,157 --> 01:14:18,260
Yes, you should have.

1077
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:21,292
- Louise, Louise ...
- Shut up!

1078
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:22,731
Alright, alright ...

1079
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:28,359
Listen, if Ian truly loves you,

1080
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:31,961
he will come to see that,
and if he does,

1081
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,064
I will be graceful about it,
and I will let him go.

1082
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,266
Ok?

1083
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:42,204
Ok.

1084
01:14:44,019 --> 01:14:46,693
Ok, just gotta figure out how 
the fuck to get outta here.

1085
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:49,379
My cell-phone is 
in my back pocket.

1086
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:53,084
If one of you guys can reach it, 
maybe you can dial 911.

1087
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:06,194
And, you say you never 
saw their faces?

1088
01:15:06,267 --> 01:15:08,038
No, never.

1089
01:15:08,165 --> 01:15:09,795
And what was the name 
of the lawn service ...

1090
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:10,822
that you normally use?

1091
01:15:10,887 --> 01:15:14,086
Mountain View Lawns.
I don't think it's those guys.

1092
01:15:14,637 --> 01:15:18,609
There was a van in the driveway,
but it was unmarked.

1093
01:15:18,758 --> 01:15:20,104
Can you describe it to me?

1094
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:27,313
Ah, it was tan, and it had a lot 
of, ah ... dirt and dust on it.

1095
01:15:29,142 --> 01:15:30,180
That's all that I remember.

1096
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:31,517
How many passenger seats?

1097
01:15:31,588 --> 01:15:35,282
Oh, I'm sorry 
I didn't count, ah ...

1098
01:15:35,811 --> 01:15:38,725
because I didn't know the 
house was being robbed.

1099
01:15:39,309 --> 01:15:42,903
Have you had any contact in town with anyone 
who asked you questions about your house,

1100
01:15:42,978 --> 01:15:44,484
or your schedule or 
anything like that?

1101
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:46,952
- No.
- No, no, not really, no.

1102
01:15:47,028 --> 01:15:49,520
We really haven't had any 
contact with anyone in town ...

1103
01:15:49,598 --> 01:15:51,567
after the 13 years 
we've been up here, no.

1104
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:53,492
No, we pretty much 
kept to ourselves.

1105
01:15:53,568 --> 01:15:56,227
I have only been to this town once.

1106
01:15:57,642 --> 01:15:59,746
Now, who are you?
What's the relationship here?

1107
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:02,249
I'm his girlfriend.

1108
01:16:03,614 --> 01:16:05,667
His mistress.

1109
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,536
We were supposed to go 
to Paris this morning,

1110
01:16:10,652 --> 01:16:15,841
where he, may or may not have been 
planning to ask me to marry him.

1111
01:16:18,605 --> 01:16:19,356
Ok.

1112
01:16:19,438 --> 01:16:21,859
Has this kind of thing ever 
happened before, officer?

1113
01:16:21,948 --> 01:16:22,686
I'm sure lots of people ...

1114
01:16:22,768 --> 01:16:24,071
have had affairs with 
much younger women.

1115
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:26,123
No, I mean a guy on a mower ...

1116
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:29,650
robbing people who have 
vacation homes up here.

1117
01:16:29,992 --> 01:16:31,743
We had a string of robberies 
a few years ago, 

1118
01:16:31,868 --> 01:16:32,995
but we caught the guy.

1119
01:16:33,078 --> 01:16:36,288
I have never really seen a 
robbery like this before.

1120
01:16:36,663 --> 01:16:38,154
Can you take them down 
to the station today ...

1121
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:40,263
and file a formal report of 
everything that's been taken?

1122
01:16:40,348 --> 01:16:41,638
Yes, of course.

1123
01:16:41,619 --> 01:16:43,707
You really think you're 
gonna catch these guys?

1124
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:47,533
It's hard to say. You are not 
really giving us much to go on.

1125
01:16:48,142 --> 01:16:49,878
There's a chance someone might 
blab about it to a friend.

1125
01:16:50,002 --> 01:16:51,838
We'll catch him that way. 
Who knows?

1126
01:16:51,947 --> 01:16:53,415
Well, here is something 
they overlooked.

1127
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:56,384
- Wow!
- All your family silverware.

1128
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:58,385
I can't believe 
they didn't see that.

1129
01:16:58,473 --> 01:17:02,323
- God, that is so lucky.
- What a blessing.

1130
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:05,592
Here is the station's address. 
Come down at noon.

1130
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:08,592
Yeah, we'll be there.

1131
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:11,749
Sorry, sorry this happened 
to you folks.

1132
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:13,239
Nah, thanks, thanks ...

1133
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:17,914
- I recommend locking your door securely.
- Oh yes, we will, we will.

1134
01:17:18,344 --> 01:17:20,491
Ok, bye now.

1135
01:17:20,746 --> 01:17:26,498
I can't believe they took everything.
They just took everything.

1136
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,391
You know I'm sorry they took ... but we are 
alive, that's the important thing, you know.

1137
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:42,316
We are Ok, we are alive and 
everything else is gonna be Ok.

1138
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,640
They could have killed us, we're 
just plain lucky they didn't.

1139
01:17:57,148 --> 01:17:59,039
Bye.

1141
01:18:56,392 --> 01:18:58,381
All is well, Ruby.

1142
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:14,508
- What time are the movers coming?
- They said they'd be here around at 3:00.

1143
01:19:14,591 --> 01:19:18,279
I can't believe how easy 
it was to sell this place.

1144
01:19:18,607 --> 01:19:21,597
We'll be so happy once we're
outta this crazy house.

1145
01:19:22,044 --> 01:19:24,180
You're already happy.

1146
01:19:30,424 --> 01:19:33,770
- Ok, what was that for?
- Because I love you.

1147
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:36,725
Hey, are you hungry?

1148
01:19:36,837 --> 01:19:39,297
Do you want to go into town 
for one last lunch?

1149
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:41,170
You're asking me out on a date?

1150
01:19:41,497 --> 01:19:45,958
I am, I'm asking you and 
Ruby out on a family date.

1151
01:19:46,654 --> 01:19:48,648
Yeah, not afraid.
