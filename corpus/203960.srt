1
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,116
You lost eight pounds.

2
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:19,525
People would kill
to be in the shape you were in.

3
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:21,222
You were recovering, but you blew it.

4
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,822
This isn't about weight, it's about lungs.

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,594
-Pneumonia.
-We don't know yet.

6
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:27,830
The fuck we don't. l know!

7
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,271
You may not, but l can't breathe.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,332
You'd breathe better
if you didn't holler like that.

9
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:37,271
This is my ex-lover's
lover's Mormon mother.

10
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,476
Even in New York in the '80s,
that is strange.

11
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:43,853
This is serious, you understand?

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,253
Keep breathing, stop moving, and stay put.
l'm getting you a room.

13
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,264
l should go.

14
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:57,824
l saw an angel.

15
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:02,134
Two weeks ago. l did. l saw her. l did.

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,339
l'm not insane.

17
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:08,741
-l didn't say you--
-l saw an angel. That's insane.

18
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,873
lnsane. But l'm not insane.
But then why did l do this to myself?

19
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:18,618
'Cause l have been driven insane
by your son and by that lying....

20
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,023
Because ever since she arrived...

21
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:28,532
ever since l have been consumed
by this ice-cold razor blade...

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,237
terror that just shouts and shouts:

23
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:36,203
''Keep moving, run,''
and l've run myself into the ground.

24
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:40,378
Right where she said l would eventually be.

25
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:42,778
Really, she seems so real.

26
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:48,744
As real as you. l remember everything.

27
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,887
What's happened to me?

28
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:54,620
Tell me.

29
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:04,668
You had a vision.

30
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,000
A vision?

31
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:09,004
Thank you, Maria Ouspenskaya.

32
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:13,068
l'm not so far gone l can be assuaged
by pity and lies.

33
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:15,080
l don't have pity.

34
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:19,681
lt's just not something l have.

35
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:31,526
1 70 years ago...

36
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,696
which is recent...

37
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,500
an angel of God appeared to Joseph Smith...

38
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:40,167
in upstate New York, not far from here.

39
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,741
People have visions.

40
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,245
That's preposterous.

41
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,110
lt's not polite...

42
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,814
to call other people's beliefs preposterous.

43
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:57,483
He had great need of understanding,
our prophet.

44
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,996
His desire made prayer.

45
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,000
His prayer made an angel.

46
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:08,032
The angel was real.

47
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,069
-l believe that.
-l don't.

48
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:15,744
l'm sorry, but it's repellant to me,
so much of what you believe.

49
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,171
What do l believe?

50
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,081
l'm a homosexual with AlDS.

51
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:23,609
-l can just imagine what you--
-No, you can't...

52
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,047
imagine...

53
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:29,857
the things in my head.

54
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:34,364
You don't make
assumptions about me, mister.

55
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,924
And l won't make them about you.

56
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:41,599
Fair enough.

57
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,163
My son is...

58
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,610
-...like you.
-Homosexual?

59
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,581
l flew into a rage when he told me.

60
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,288
Mad as hornets.

61
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,080
l assumed at first it was about....

62
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,822
-Homosexuality?
-But that wasn't it.

63
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,826
Homosexuality.

64
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:13,737
That just seems so ungainly to me.

65
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,565
Two men together.

66
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:20,278
lt's not an appetizing notion.

67
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:24,380
But then, for me,
men in any configuration is....

68
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:29,220
They're just so lumpish and...

69
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:31,616
stupid.

70
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,086
Stupidity gets me crazy.

71
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:37,954
l wish you'd be more true
to your demographic profile.

72
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,023
Life is confusing enough.

73
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,112
You know the Bible.

74
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,009
Reasonably well, yes.

75
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:58,178
The prophets in the Bible,
do they ever refuse their vision?

76
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:02,553
There is scriptural precedent, yes.

77
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,684
What does God do to them
when they do that?

78
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,530
He feeds them to whales.

79
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:19,338
Here, just be still...

80
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,903
you'll be all right.

81
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:26,975
No, l won't be.

82
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:30,578
My lungs are getting tighter.

83
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,489
The fever mounts, and you get delirious.

84
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:36,924
Then the days of delirium
and all the pain and drugs.

85
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,091
Then you start slipping.

86
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,264
l really fucked up.

87
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:49,734
l'm scared, l can't do it again.

88
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,935
You shouldn't talk that way.

89
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:56,044
You should make a better show of yourself.

90
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:57,775
Look at this horror.

91
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,854
See? That's not human. That's why l run.

92
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,588
Wouldn't you? Wouldn't anybody?

93
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,057
lt's a cancer.

94
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,625
Nothing more.

95
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:15,665
Nothing more human than that.

96
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:18,769
God, l wanna be done. l don't want this!

97
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,236
l reject this.

98
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,539
l'm sorry.

99
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:28,441
Stay with me, please.
Just till my friend gets off work.

100
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,817
You comfort me. You do.

101
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,485
You stiffen my spine.

102
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,622
When l got up this morning...

103
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,066
this is not how l envisioned
the day would end.

104
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:57,574
An angel is a belief...

105
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:02,474
with wings and arms that can carry you.

106
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:05,843
lt's not to be afraid of.

107
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,555
lf it can't hold you up...

108
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,451
seek for something new.

109
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:33,978
Louis.

110
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:54,263
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,301
lt's the spring rain, is all.

112
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:02,906
lt's her.

113
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,376
She's approaching.

114
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,008
She?

115
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,924
Modesty forbids explaining
exactly how l know...

116
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:22,092
but l have an infallible barometer
of her proximity.

117
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,027
And it's rising.

118
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,933
Hello.

119
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,347
l've come back.

120
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,145
Please let me in.

121
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,254
You're in.

122
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:29,092
''Have you no decency, sir? At long last,
Have you no sense of decency?''

123
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,762
Who said that?

124
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,103
l'm having a really hard time, Louis.

125
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,500
lt's so good to see you again.

126
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,546
You really don't know who said,
''Have you no decency?''

127
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:42,208
-What's wrong?
-Second question: Have you no decency?

128
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,951
Guess what l spent
the rainy afternoon doing?

129
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,611
-What?
-My homework.

130
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,019
Research at the courthouse.
Look what l got.

131
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,150
The decisions
of Justice Theodore J. Wilson...

132
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,990
Second Circuit Court of Appeals, 1981-1984.

133
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:57,498
-The Reagan Years.
-You read my decisions.

134
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,633
Your decisions. Yes.

135
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,996
The librarian was gay.
He had all the good dish.

136
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,868
He said Wilson
didn't write these opinions any more...

137
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,407
than Nixon wrote Six Crises...

138
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,272
Or Kennedy wrote Profiles in Courage.

139
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:10,504
...or Reagan wrote Where's the Rest of Me...

140
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,206
or you and l wrote the Book of Love.

141
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:15,774
Listen, l don't wanna do this now.
l need you to stop attacking me.

142
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:19,344
These gems were ghost-written by you...

143
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:22,583
his obedient eager clerk.
Naturally, l was eager to read them.

144
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,594
Now l love the one
where you found against those women...

145
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:28,563
on Staten lsland who were
suing the New Jersey factory.

146
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:31,164
The toothpaste makers
whose orange-colored smoke...

147
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,531
was blinding children.

148
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,161
Not blind, just minor irritation.

149
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:36,900
Three of them had to be hospitalized, Joe.

150
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:39,908
lt's sort of brilliant in a satanic sort of way...

151
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,945
concluding that these women
have no right...

152
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,276
to sue under
the Air and Water Protection Act...

153
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:46,976
because that Act doesn't protect people...

154
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:50,248
but actually only air and water. Amazing!

155
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:51,413
Have you no decency?

156
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:54,286
l can't believe my opinions
are being criticized by the guy...

157
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,919
who changes the coffee filters
in the Secretary's Lounge.

158
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,758
Absolute favorite is this.

159
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,354
Stephens v. the United States...

160
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,401
the Army guy who got
a dishonorable discharge for being gay.

161
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:06,631
Stevens told the Army
that he was gay when he enlisted.

162
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:09,003
When he got ready to retire,
they booted him out...

163
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,507
cheat the queer of his pension.

164
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,873
Right. He sued, won the case,
and got his pension.

165
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:16,107
The first judges gave him
his pension back because...

166
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:19,640
they ruled that gay men are members
of a legitimate minority...

167
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:23,587
entitled to the special protection of
the 1 4th Amendment of the US Constitution.

168
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,351
''Equal protection under the law.''

169
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:26,482
l can just imagine...

170
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,460
how news of that momentary lapse
into decency was received.

171
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:32,156
Then all the judges of the Second Circuit
were assembled--

172
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:34,096
We found for the guy again.

173
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,758
But on an equitable estoppel.

174
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:39,499
l had to look that up. But Mr. Coffee
can't be expected to know these things.

175
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:43,168
They didn't change the decision,
just the reason for the decision.

176
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,006
They gave it to him on a technicality.

177
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,377
The Army knew Stevens was gay
when he was enlisted. That's why he won.

178
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:51,781
Not because it's unconstitutional
to discriminate against homosexuals.

179
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,717
''Because homosexuals,'' they write...

180
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:56,415
''are not entitled to equal protection
under the law.''

181
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,084
-You're being melodramatic.
-They didn't write this.

182
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,220
You did. They gave this decision
to Wilson to write.

183
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:05,858
Which, since they know he's a vegetable
incapable of writing do-re-mi...

184
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,131
was quite the vote of confidence
in his industrious little clerk.

185
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:11,933
This is an important bit
of legal fag-bashing, isn't it?

186
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:14,304
They trusted you to do it
and you didn't disappoint.

187
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,706
lt's law, not justice.

188
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,870
lt's power, not the merits of its exercise.

189
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,210
lt's not an expression of an ideal, it's reality.

190
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,181
So who said, ''Have you no decency?''

191
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,445
l'm leaving.

192
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,311
You moron. How could you not know that?

193
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,117
l'm leaving, you son of a bitch!

194
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,488
lt's the greatest punch line
in American history.

195
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,390
-Out of my way!
-''Have you no decency?''

196
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,554
''At long last, sir, have you no decency?''

197
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,825
l don't know who said it.
Why are you doing this?

198
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,799
-l love you!
-Joseph Welch!

199
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,357
The Army-McCarthy Hearings!

200
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,496
Ask Roy! He'll tell you, he knows!
He was there.

201
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,701
Roy Cohn!

202
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:49,504
-What l want to know is, did you fuck him?
-Did l what?

203
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:53,140
How often has the latex-sheathed cock
l put in my mouth...

204
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:56,310
been previously in the mouth
of the most evil, twisted...

205
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:59,480
vicious bastard ever to snort coke
at Studio 54?

206
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:02,286
'Cause lips that kissed those lips
will never kiss mine!

207
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,691
Don't worry about that. Get out of my--

208
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,097
Did you fuck him?

209
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:10,793
-Did he pay you to let him fuck you?
-Move!

210
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:14,297
You lied to me.

211
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:15,703
You love me?

212
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:17,832
Fuck you, you cheap piece of shit!

213
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:23,944
He's got AlDS.

214
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:26,210
Do you even know that?

215
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:28,514
Stupid closeted bigot!

216
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,555
You probably never figured out--

217
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:34,750
Hypocrite!

218
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:40,858
Stop!

219
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:01,049
Please say you're okay.

220
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,723
God, that hurt.

221
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,592
l never did that before.

222
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,391
l never hit anyone.

223
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:18,335
-Can you open it? Can you see?
-l can see blood.

224
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,009
Let me get a towel.

225
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,942
l could have you arrested, you creep.

226
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:30,308
They could put you in jail for beating me up.

227
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:31,942
l've never hit anyone before.

228
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,454
lt'd really be for those decisions....

229
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:40,184
lt was like a sex scene
in an Ayn Rand novel, huh?

230
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:44,254
l hurt you. l'm sorry, Louis.
l never hit anyone before.

231
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,430
Get lost...

232
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:50,131
before l really lose my temper
and hurt you back.

233
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,015
l just wanna lie here and bleed for a while.

234
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:02,782
Do me good.

235
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,244
Look at that big smile.

236
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,779
What you got to smile about, Roy?

237
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,148
l'm going, Ethel.

238
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:10,583
Finally, finally...

239
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:12,783
done with this world.

240
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,089
At long last.

241
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:20,260
All mine enemies will be
standing on the other shore...

242
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,327
mouths gaping open like stupid fish...

243
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:28,738
while the Almighty parts the sea of death...

244
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:34,211
and lets his Roy-boy
cross over the Jordan...

245
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:37,539
on dry land...

246
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,779
and still a lawyer.

247
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:44,117
l wouldn't count my chickens, Roy.

248
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:47,054
lt's over.

249
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:50,221
Over?

250
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:53,625
l wanted the news should come from me.

251
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:58,030
The panel rules against you, Roy.

252
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:01,131
Oh, no.

253
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:05,305
They just started meeting two days ago.

254
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,077
They recommended disbarment.

255
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:13,854
The executive has to rule
on the recommendation.

256
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:17,449
That'll take at least a week
to sort things out.

257
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:20,653
The executive was waiting.

258
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,327
And they ruled. One, two, three.

259
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,963
They accepted the panel's recommendation.

260
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:33,440
And one of the main guys on the executive...

261
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:35,977
he leaned over to his friend and he said:

262
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:37,342
''Finally!

263
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:41,916
''l've hated that little faggot for 36 years.''

264
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:52,289
They won, Roy.
You're not a lawyer anymore.

265
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,159
-But am l dead?
-No.

266
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:03,004
They beat you. You lost.

267
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,253
l decided to come here...

268
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:26,490
so l could see, could l forgive you?

269
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:29,088
You...

270
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:33,428
who l have hated so terribly.

271
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:38,174
l have borne my hatred up
into the heavens...

272
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:41,872
and made a needle-sharp little star
in the sky out of it.

273
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:47,009
lt's the star of Ethel Rosenberg's hatred.

274
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:51,652
And it burns every year, for one night only.

275
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:55,517
June 19.

276
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,691
lt burns acid green.

277
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,332
l came to forgive...

278
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:12,074
but all l can do is take pleasure
in your misery...

279
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,981
hoping l would get to see you die...

280
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,879
more terrible than l did.

281
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:25,091
And you are...

282
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:28,726
'cause you're dying in shit, Roy.

283
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,291
Defeated.

284
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,026
And you could kill me.

285
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:37,334
But you couldn't ever defeat me.

286
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:43,470
You never won.

287
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,840
When you die...

288
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:52,979
all anyone will ever say is...

289
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:56,113
''Better he had never lived at all.''

290
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:03,421
Ma?

291
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,358
Muddy, is it?

292
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,938
lt's Ethel, Roy.

293
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:15,774
l feel bad.

294
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:24,886
Who are you talking to? lt's me.

295
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,954
Good to see you, Ma.

296
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,086
lt's been years.

297
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,561
l feel bad.

298
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:34,861
Sing to me.

299
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,892
l am not your mother, Roy.

300
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,629
lt's cold in here.

301
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,633
l'm up so late.

302
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,769
Past my time.

303
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,177
Don't be mad, Ma.

304
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:56,476
l'm scared a little.

305
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,012
Don't be mad.

306
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,515
Sing me a song.

307
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,829
-Please.
-l don't want to, Roy.

308
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,957
-l am not--
-lt's scary out here.

309
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,897
Oh, God.

310
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,764
God...

311
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,044
l'm so sorry.

312
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,678
So sorry.

313
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,969
Roy.

314
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:04,476
Are you....

315
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:23,601
-That's it.
-What's up? Do you need me?

316
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:34,543
No, l'm not! l fooled you, Ethel!

317
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:37,048
l knew who you were all along.

318
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:39,421
l can't believe you fell for that Ma stuff.

319
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:42,950
l just wanted to see if l could finally...

320
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:45,759
make Ethel Rosenberg sing!

321
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:47,128
l win!

322
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,126
Fuck.

323
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:04,711
Next time around...

324
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:08,117
l don't wanna be a man.

325
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,454
l wanna be an octopus.

326
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:16,252
Remember that, okay?

327
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,193
She's on her way.

328
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:05,795
Turn the lights back on!

329
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,638
Turn the lights back on!

330
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,859
l have returned, Prophet...

331
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:27,020
and not according to plan!

332
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,222
Take it back!

333
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:32,028
The book, whatever you left with me,
l won't be its repository. l reject it.

334
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,632
You gotta help me out here! Help me!

335
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:38,265
This is a dream.

336
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:41,333
l don't think that's really the point
at this particular moment.

337
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,435
l don't know what to do.

338
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:45,140
lt was your idea. ''Reject the vision,''
you said.

339
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:47,843
l thought it was going to be
more of a metaphorical....

340
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,818
You said scriptural precedent.

341
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:51,751
What am l supposed to do?

342
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,288
Wrestle her!

343
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:58,825
Say, what?

344
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:01,831
lt's an angel! You just grab hold of her...

345
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,664
and say....

346
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:05,966
What was it?

347
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:07,697
Wait.

348
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:10,707
Yes. You grab a hold of her and you say...

349
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:15,846
''l will not let thee go except thou bless me.''

350
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,517
Then you wrestle her until she gives in.

351
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:25,588
You wrestle her.
l don't know how to wrestle.

352
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:24,645
l will not let thee go except thou bless me!

353
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,516
Take back your book!

354
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:56,882
Free me! Unfetter me!

355
00:29:56,952 --> 00:30:01,218
Bless me or whatever, but l will be let go.

356
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:09,229
l am the continental principality of America!

357
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,965
l am a bird of prey!

358
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:16,437
l will not be compelled!

359
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,271
Entrance has been gained.

360
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,543
Return the text to Heaven.

361
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,539
Can l come back?

362
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:00,950
l don't wanna go unless....

363
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,544
You have prevailed, Prophet. You choose.

364
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:06,318
Now release me.
l have torn a muscle in my thigh.

365
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:09,258
Big deal. My leg's been hurting for months.

366
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,357
What?

367
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:29,070
You've got no business with me.

368
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,844
l didn't call you. You are his fever dream.

369
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,013
Not mine.

370
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,946
He's gone now...

371
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:40,656
so you should go, too.

372
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:47,430
l'm going to wake up now.

373
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:49,663
Right now.

374
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:31,243
The body is the garden of the soul.

375
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,350
Greetings, Prophet.

376
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:56,720
We have been waiting for you.

377
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:58,189
Hurry.

378
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,695
Oh, my God.

379
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:06,026
This is too weird for words. lt's Roy Cohn.

380
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:08,360
lt's so creepy here. l hate hospitals.

381
00:37:08,504 --> 00:37:10,904
Stop whining. We have to move fast.

382
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,031
l'm supposed to call the duty nurse
if his condition changes.

383
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:16,042
lt's changed.

384
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,012
Take off those glasses. You look ridiculous.

385
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:22,882
What happened to you?

386
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:24,852
Expiation for my sins.

387
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:28,152
-What am l doing here?
-Expiation for your sins.

388
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,418
l can't take this stuff out myself.

389
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:32,723
l have to tell them he's dead
and fill out forms.

390
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:35,662
l don't want them confiscating the medicine.
lt's AZT.

391
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:37,393
Nearly 60 bottles left.

392
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:40,201
l needed a pack mule, so l called you.

393
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,794
Why me? You hate me.

394
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:44,430
l needed a Jew. You were the first
to come to mind.

395
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:47,033
-What do you mean?
-We're gonna thank him.

396
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,578
-For the pills.
-Thank him?

397
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:50,739
What do you call the Jewish prayer
for the dead?

398
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:52,873
-A Kaddish.
-That's the one. Hit it.

399
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:54,643
Do it.

400
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:57,380
l'm not saying Kaddish for him.

401
00:37:57,454 --> 00:37:59,479
The drugs, okay, fine, sure.

402
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:02,424
But no fucking way am l praying for him.

403
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:06,760
My New Deal pinko parents in Schenectady
would never forgive me.

404
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:08,662
They're already so disappointed:

405
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,598
''He's a fag, he's an office temp.

406
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:12,899
''Now look, he's saying Kaddish
for Roy Cohn.''

407
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:15,098
l can't believe you'd actually pray for him.

408
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,198
Louis, l'd even pray for you.

409
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,369
He was a terrible person.

410
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:24,378
He died a hard death.

411
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:32,380
Maybe a queen can forgive
her vanquished foe.

412
00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:38,158
lt isn't easy. lt doesn't count if it's easy.
lt's the hardest thing.

413
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:40,464
Forgiveness.

414
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:43,798
Maybe that's where
love and justice finally meet.

415
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:48,332
Peace at least.
lsn't what the Kaddish asks for?

416
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:51,036
lt's Hebrew or Aramaic or something.

417
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:53,102
Who knows what it's asking.

418
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,251
l'm 32 years old...

419
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,413
and l've never been in a room
with a dead body before.

420
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,901
So heavy and small.

421
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:19,305
l know probably less of the Kaddish
than you do.

422
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:22,810
l'm an intensely secular Jew.
l didn't even bar mitzvah.

423
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:25,004
Do the best you can.

424
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:53,740
No, that's the Kiddush, not the....

425
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,845
l don't know. This is silly. Please, l can't.

426
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:15,951
-You son of a bitch.
-You son of a bitch.

427
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:45,886
Thank you, Louis.

428
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:48,524
You did fine.

429
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:50,253
Fine?

430
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:54,830
What are you talking about fine now?
lt was fucking miraculous.

431
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:57,325
l saw it. lt was there.

432
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:29,129
Most august fellow principalities,
angels most high...

433
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:31,796
l regret my absence at this session.

434
00:43:31,871 --> 00:43:33,862
l was detained.

435
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:38,905
-This is....
-The Prophet. Yes.

436
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:47,819
-We're working.
-We're making progress.

437
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:03,131
l wanna return this.

438
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:07,301
-What's the matter with it?
-lt just....

439
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:13,476
We can't just stop.

440
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:16,214
We're not rocks.

441
00:44:16,518 --> 00:44:20,852
Progress, migration, motion is modernity.

442
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:22,389
lt's animate.

443
00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:26,120
lt's what living things do. We desire.

444
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:30,156
Even if all we desire is stillness,
it's still desire.

445
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:33,632
For, even if we go faster than we should...

446
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:37,238
we can't wait, and wait for what?

447
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:38,295
God....

448
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:52,983
He isn't coming back.

449
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:56,692
Even if he did, if he ever did come back...

450
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,464
if he ever dared to show his face
or whatever in the garden again...

451
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,926
if after all this destruction...

452
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:09,166
if after all the terrible days
of this terrible century...

453
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:14,399
he returned to see how much suffering
his abandonment has created...

454
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,875
if all he has to offer is death...

455
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,547
you should sue the bastard.

456
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:24,247
That's my only contribution
to all this theology.

457
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:28,650
Sue the bastard for walking out.
How dare he!

458
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:33,564
Thus spake the Prophet.

459
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:40,169
So thank you for sharing this with me,
but l don't want to keep it.

460
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,467
He wants to live.

461
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,134
Yes! l'm 30 years old, for God's sake.

462
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,200
l haven't done anything yet.

463
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,944
l wanna be healthy again.

464
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:52,744
And this plague, it should stop
in me and everywhere.

465
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:57,277
-Make it go away.
-We have tried.

466
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:01,256
We suffer with you...

467
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:05,721
but we don't know. We do not know how.

468
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,764
This is the tome of immobility...

469
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:13,228
of respite.

470
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:17,133
Stay in heaven, don't return to life.

471
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:19,068
Suffer no more.

472
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:21,178
You choose.

473
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:27,576
l can't.

474
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:48,973
l still want my blessing.

475
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:52,941
Even sick, l wanna be alive.

476
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:55,282
You only think you do.

477
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:57,476
Life is a habit with you.

478
00:46:57,552 --> 00:47:00,043
You have not seen what is to come.
We have.

479
00:47:00,155 --> 00:47:03,454
What will the grim unfolding
of these latter days bring...

480
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:06,723
that you or any being should wish
to endure them?

481
00:47:07,096 --> 00:47:08,085
Death...

482
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:12,158
more plenteous than all heaven
has tears to mourn it.

483
00:47:13,503 --> 00:47:15,971
The slow dissolving of the great design.

484
00:47:16,205 --> 00:47:19,140
The spiraling apart of the work of eternity.

485
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:23,671
The world and its beautiful particle logic...

486
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:26,408
all collapsed, all dead...

487
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,740
forever.

488
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:31,983
We are failing.

489
00:47:32,623 --> 00:47:35,091
The earth and the angels.

490
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:39,122
Who asks of the Order's blessing
with Apocalypse descending?

491
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:41,323
Who demands more life...

492
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:44,892
when death like a protector
blinds our eyes...

493
00:47:44,968 --> 00:47:48,233
shielding from tender nerve
more horror than can be borne?

494
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:53,507
Let any being on whom Fortune smiles
creep away to death...

495
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:56,411
before that last, dreadful daybreak...

496
00:47:56,481 --> 00:47:59,041
when all your ravaging returns to you.

497
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,917
And morning blisters crimson
and bears all life away.

498
00:48:04,322 --> 00:48:06,916
A tidal wave of protean fire...

499
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:10,017
that curls around the planet
and bares the earth...

500
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:13,756
clean as bone.

501
00:48:19,205 --> 00:48:20,570
But still...

502
00:48:29,248 --> 00:48:32,809
bless me anyway. l want more life.
l can't help myself.

503
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,044
l do.

504
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:38,188
l've lived through such terrible times...

505
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:41,193
and there are people
who live through much worse.

506
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:43,622
But you see them living anyway.

507
00:48:43,997 --> 00:48:46,932
When they're more spirit than body...

508
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,093
more sores than skin...

509
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,434
when they're burned and in agony...

510
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:56,268
when flies lay eggs in the corners
of the eyes of their children...

511
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,638
they live.

512
00:48:57,745 --> 00:48:59,679
Death usually has to take life away.

513
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:01,806
l don't know if that's just the animal.

514
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:05,943
l don't know if it's not braver to die,
but l recognize the habit.

515
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:08,713
The addiction to being alive.

516
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:12,089
So we live past hope.

517
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,822
lf l can find hope anywhere, that's it,
that's the best l can do.

518
00:49:16,197 --> 00:49:18,132
lt's so much not enough.

519
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,195
lt's so inadequate.

520
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:23,531
But still...

521
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,567
bless me anyway.

522
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,768
l want more life.

523
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:02,511
And if He returns, take Him to court.

524
00:50:02,846 --> 00:50:04,643
He walked out on us.

525
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:06,639
He ought to pay.

526
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:29,226
l'm exhausted.

527
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:32,806
-You've been working hard.
-l feel terrible.

528
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,400
We were worried we'd lost you.

529
00:51:36,477 --> 00:51:39,207
-Welcome back to the world.
-From where?

530
00:51:45,586 --> 00:51:47,019
Well, look at this.

531
00:51:48,957 --> 00:51:50,481
lt's the dawn of man.

532
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,323
-Venus rising from the sea.
-l'm wet.

533
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:56,729
-Fever broke. That's a good sign.
-Mrs. Pitt.

534
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,791
The little girl's room.
Where did you find her?

535
00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:02,559
We found each other.

536
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:06,033
l've had a remarkable dream.

537
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,605
And you were there and you...

538
00:52:09,678 --> 00:52:10,941
and you.

539
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:13,204
l what?

540
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:16,184
Some of it was terrible
and some of it was wonderful.

541
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:19,113
But all the same,
l kept saying l wanna go home.

542
00:52:19,189 --> 00:52:22,488
-And they sent me home.
-What are you talking about?

543
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,149
Thank you.

544
00:52:26,095 --> 00:52:28,962
-l just sat in a chair.
-She saved my life.

545
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:32,197
Did no such thing. l slept in the chair.

546
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:37,802
Being in the hospital upsets me,
reminds me of things.

547
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,740
l have to go now.

548
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,512
l had the most peculiar dream.

549
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,924
Can l come in?

550
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,222
l have to start rounds.

551
00:53:00,932 --> 00:53:04,424
You are one of the lucky ones.
l could give you a rose.

552
00:53:04,503 --> 00:53:06,334
You rest your weary bones.

553
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,941
What happened to you?

554
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:15,837
Visible scars.

555
00:53:16,649 --> 00:53:19,880
Louis, you're so goddamn
literal about everything.

556
00:53:21,821 --> 00:53:23,789
-l'm going now.
-You'll come back?

557
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,723
lf l can....

558
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:28,489
l have things l have to take care of.

559
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:32,361
Please do. l have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

560
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:35,026
That's a stupid thing to do.

561
00:53:38,505 --> 00:53:39,494
Who's she?

562
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:42,141
You really don't want to know.

563
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:44,171
Before l depart...

564
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:46,438
a homecoming gift.

565
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:56,355
What, l can't read the label.

566
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:58,791
My eyes aren't any better.

567
00:54:00,895 --> 00:54:02,658
AZT, where on earth?

568
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:05,561
These are hot pills. l am shocked.

569
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:08,500
Contribution to the Get Well Fund
from a bad fairy.

570
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,765
These pills, they make you better.

571
00:54:11,072 --> 00:54:13,700
They're poison, they make you anemic.

572
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:17,805
This is my life from now on, Louis.
l'm not getting better.

573
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:21,074
l'm not sure l'm ready to do that
to my bone marrow.

574
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,243
We can talk about it tomorrow.

575
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:26,777
l am going home to nurse my grudges.

576
00:54:27,456 --> 00:54:28,616
Ta, baby.

577
00:54:29,258 --> 00:54:30,782
Sleep all day.

578
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,091
Ta, Louis.

579
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:36,794
You sure know how to clear a room.

580
00:54:42,205 --> 00:54:43,399
Prior.

581
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:46,465
l wanna come back to you.

582
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:53,376
You could respond.

583
00:54:54,985 --> 00:54:57,647
You could say something.
Just say it's fine or...

584
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:00,051
it's not fine, but sure, what the hell or....

585
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:04,223
l really failed you.

586
00:55:10,434 --> 00:55:11,628
Sorry.

587
00:55:14,872 --> 00:55:16,840
Failing in love...

588
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:20,405
isn't the same as not loving.

589
00:55:20,745 --> 00:55:24,044
lt doesn't let you off the hook.
lt doesn't mean...

590
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:27,280
you're free to not love.

591
00:55:35,093 --> 00:55:36,754
l love you, Louis.

592
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:51,435
Good.

593
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:54,970
-l love you.
-l really do.

594
00:55:56,683 --> 00:55:58,378
But you can't come back.

595
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:01,083
Not ever.

596
00:56:08,027 --> 00:56:10,019
l'm sorry, but you can't.

597
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:31,181
l want your credit card.

598
00:56:32,087 --> 00:56:33,179
That's all.

599
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:37,214
You can keep track of me
from where the charges come from...

600
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:39,260
if you wanna keep track.

601
00:56:43,531 --> 00:56:46,193
-l have some things to tell you.
-We shouldn't talk.

602
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:48,758
l don't want to do that anymore.
Credit card?

603
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:53,534
l don't know
what will happen to me without you.

604
00:56:56,645 --> 00:56:58,374
Only you love me...

605
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,240
out of everyone in the world.

606
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:04,811
l've done things, l'm ashamed, but....

607
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,489
l've changed.

608
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,919
l don't know how yet, but...

609
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:12,824
please...

610
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,957
don't leave me now, Harper.

611
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,659
You're my good heart.

612
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,464
Did that hurt?

613
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,034
Yes? Remember that.

614
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,739
Please.

615
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:38,953
lf l can get a job or something, l'll cut the
card to pieces and there won't be charges.

616
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:43,687
Credit card.

617
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,087
Just call or....

618
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,128
Just call. You have to.

619
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:53,727
No, probably never again.

620
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,036
That's how bad.

621
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:02,242
Sometimes, maybe lost is best.

622
00:58:05,617 --> 00:58:06,914
Get lost, Joe.

623
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,277
Go exploring...

624
00:58:10,355 --> 00:58:12,380
with a big glass of water.

625
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,917
You look a fright.

626
00:59:50,994 --> 00:59:53,428
-So do you.
-l had a horrid night.

627
00:59:53,497 --> 00:59:55,362
-So did l.
-Where is....

628
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:00,060
l'm sure she'll be all right.

629
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:06,368
-What can happen to her in New York City?
-lt's not what l expected...

630
01:00:06,877 --> 01:00:09,312
which is the best thing
you can say for it.

631
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:13,410
Shall l make supper tonight?

632
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,612
Joe?

633
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,822
l'll try to wait up till you get home.

634
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,969
Night flight to San Francisco.

635
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,006
Chase the moon across America.

636
01:01:12,546 --> 01:01:13,535
God!

637
01:01:13,981 --> 01:01:16,711
lt's been years since l was on a plane.

638
01:01:17,618 --> 01:01:19,677
When we hit 35,000 feet...

639
01:01:19,954 --> 01:01:21,922
we'll have reached the tropopause...

640
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:24,583
the great belt of calm air.

641
01:01:24,658 --> 01:01:26,819
As close as l'll ever get to the ozone.

642
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:29,553
l dreamed we were there.

643
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:32,791
The plane leapt the tropopause,
the safe air...

644
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:35,598
and attained the outer rim, the ozone...

645
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,605
which was ragged and torn, patches of it...

646
01:01:39,174 --> 01:01:42,632
threadbare as old cheesecloth,
and that was frightening.

647
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:44,869
But l saw something only l could see...

648
01:01:44,946 --> 01:01:47,938
because of my astonishing ability
to see such things.

649
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,347
Souls were rising...

650
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,452
from the earth far below, souls of the dead...

651
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:56,355
of people who'd perished from...

652
01:01:56,926 --> 01:02:00,987
famine, from war, from the plague,
and they floated up...

653
01:02:02,031 --> 01:02:05,762
like skydivers in reverse, limbs all akimbo,
wheeling and...

654
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,632
spinning.

655
01:02:08,304 --> 01:02:10,772
And the souls of these departed...

656
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,034
joined hands, clasped ankles, and formed...

657
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,872
a web...

658
01:02:16,779 --> 01:02:18,714
a great net of souls.

659
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:22,146
And the souls
were three-atom oxygen molecules...

660
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:26,656
of the stuff of ozone, and the outer rim
absorbed them, and was repaired.

661
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:32,728
Nothing's lost forever.

662
01:02:36,767 --> 01:02:39,099
ln this world, there is a kind of...

663
01:02:41,372 --> 01:02:43,033
painful progress.

664
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:48,410
Longing for what we've left behind, and...

665
01:02:49,214 --> 01:02:50,772
dreaming ahead.

666
01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:57,413
At least l think that's so.

667
01:03:10,302 --> 01:03:12,099
The Berlin Wall has fallen.

668
01:03:12,304 --> 01:03:13,931
The Ceausescus are out.

669
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:17,566
He's building democratic socialism,
the new internationalism.

670
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:20,635
Gorbachev is the greatest political thinker
since Lenin.

671
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,944
We don't know enough yet
to start canonizing him.

672
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:24,574
The Russians hate his guts.

673
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,892
Happy birthday.

674
01:03:44,705 --> 01:03:46,673
Thomas Jefferson died on his birthday.

675
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:49,232
-You aren't Thomas Jefferson.
-l'm related to him.

676
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:52,541
-The Walters are related to everyone.
-Only the white meat, darling.

677
01:03:57,351 --> 01:03:58,579
Salute.

678
01:04:02,623 --> 01:04:06,116
Remember four years ago,
the whole time we were feeling...

679
01:04:06,195 --> 01:04:07,685
everything everywhere was stuck.

680
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:10,732
While in Russia, perestroika, the thaw.

681
01:04:10,866 --> 01:04:14,165
lt's the end of the Cold War.
The whole world's changing overnight.

682
01:04:14,236 --> 01:04:18,935
l wonder what will happen now, though,
in places like Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia.

683
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:22,338
-Yugoslavia.
-Let's turn the volume down on this, okay?

684
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:23,878
They'll be at it for hours.

685
01:04:23,946 --> 01:04:27,040
lt's not that what they're saying
isn't important, it's just....

686
01:04:29,118 --> 01:04:32,610
This is my favorite place in New York City,
no, in the whole universe...

687
01:04:32,689 --> 01:04:35,749
the parts that l've seen, on a day like today.

688
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:39,385
A sunny winter's day,
warm and cold at once.

689
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:44,764
The sky's a little hazy, so the sunlight
has a physical presence, a character.

690
01:04:45,335 --> 01:04:48,327
ln autumn, those trees across the lake
are yellow...

691
01:04:49,072 --> 01:04:52,042
and the sun strikes those most brilliantly...

692
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:54,871
against the blue of the sky.

693
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:59,176
That sad fall blue, those trees
are more light than vegetation.

694
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,547
They're Yankee trees.

695
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:03,142
New England transplants.

696
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,586
They're barren now.

697
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:09,558
lt's January 1990.

698
01:05:09,793 --> 01:05:12,092
l've been living with AlDS for five years.

699
01:05:12,163 --> 01:05:14,961
That's six whole months
longer than l lived with Louis.

700
01:05:15,033 --> 01:05:18,799
...amount of energy, whatever comes,
what you have to admire in Gorbachev...

701
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,896
and the Russians is that they are
making a leap into the unknown.

702
01:05:21,973 --> 01:05:24,635
You can't wait around for theory.
The sprawl of life...

703
01:05:24,709 --> 01:05:25,698
the weird....

704
01:05:25,844 --> 01:05:27,141
-lnterconnectedness.
-Yes.

705
01:05:27,212 --> 01:05:28,873
Maybe the sheer size of the terrain.

706
01:05:28,947 --> 01:05:31,711
lt's all too much to be encompassed
by a single theory now.

707
01:05:31,783 --> 01:05:33,274
The world is faster than the mind.

708
01:05:33,352 --> 01:05:35,513
That's what politics is,
the world moving ahead.

709
01:05:35,588 --> 01:05:37,988
And only in politics
does the miraculous occur.

710
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,519
But that's a theory.

711
01:05:41,294 --> 01:05:45,390
Yes, but you can't live in the world
without an idea of the world.

712
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:47,756
But it's living that makes the ideas.

713
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:51,030
You can't wait for a theory,
but you have to have a theory.

714
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,230
Go know, as my grandma would say.

715
01:05:54,507 --> 01:05:56,567
This angel, she is my favorite angel.

716
01:05:57,611 --> 01:05:59,909
l like them best when they are statuary.

717
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,541
They commemorate death,
but suggest a world without dying.

718
01:06:03,617 --> 01:06:07,246
They're made of the heaviest
things on earth, stone and iron.

719
01:06:07,321 --> 01:06:08,913
They weigh tons.

720
01:06:10,123 --> 01:06:13,752
But their wings, they are engines
and instruments of flight.

721
01:06:15,595 --> 01:06:17,291
This is the angel Bethesda.

722
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:19,595
Louis will tell you her story.

723
01:06:22,403 --> 01:06:26,066
She was this angel who landed
in the Temple Square in Jerusalem...

724
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,903
in the days of the Second Temple.

725
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:30,876
Right in the middle of a working day,
she descended and...

726
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:34,813
her foot touched earth, and where it did,
a fountain shot up from the ground.

727
01:06:34,882 --> 01:06:38,478
When the Romans destroyed the temple,
the fountain of Bethesda ran dry.

728
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:42,581
Belize will tell you about the nature of
the fountain before its flowing stopped.

729
01:06:45,894 --> 01:06:49,762
lf anyone who was suffering in...

730
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,392
the body or the spirit...

731
01:06:52,468 --> 01:06:55,335
walked through the waters
of the fountain of Bethesda...

732
01:06:55,404 --> 01:06:56,837
they would be healed...

733
01:06:57,473 --> 01:06:58,997
washed clean of pain.

734
01:06:59,074 --> 01:07:01,441
They know this 'cause
l've told them many times.

735
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:05,009
Hannah here told it to me.
She also told me this:

736
01:07:05,582 --> 01:07:08,278
-When the Millennium comes....
-Not the year 2000 but...

737
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:10,319
-the capital-M Millennium.
-Right.

738
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,282
The Bethesda fountain will flow again.

739
01:07:13,623 --> 01:07:16,854
And l told him that l would
personally take him there to bathe.

740
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:19,019
We will all bathe ourselves clean.

741
01:07:19,162 --> 01:07:20,595
Not literally in Jerusalem.

742
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:23,064
We don't want this to have
Zionist implications.

743
01:07:23,134 --> 01:07:26,399
But we do recognize
the right of the State of lsrael to exist.

744
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:30,406
But the West Bank should be homeland
to the Palestinians and the Golan Heights....

745
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:32,772
Not both the West Bank
and the Golan Heights and...

746
01:07:32,843 --> 01:07:34,970
no one supports Palestinians
more than l do.

747
01:07:35,045 --> 01:07:37,809
-You're right.
-l'm almost done.

748
01:07:39,383 --> 01:07:42,409
The fountain's not flowing now.
They turn it off in the winter.

749
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:44,148
lce in the pipes.

750
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:47,315
But in the summer...

751
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:50,322
it's a sight to see.
l wanna be around to see it.

752
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,495
l plan to be. l hope to be.

753
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:58,128
This disease will be the end of many of us,
but not nearly all.

754
01:07:58,804 --> 01:08:00,999
And the dead will be commemorated...

755
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:03,434
and will struggle on with the living...

756
01:08:03,742 --> 01:08:05,438
and we're not going away.

757
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:08,036
We won't die secret deaths anymore.

758
01:08:09,315 --> 01:08:11,510
The world only spins forward.

759
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:14,448
We will be citizens.

760
01:08:14,854 --> 01:08:16,515
The time has come.

761
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,122
Bye now.

762
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:25,754
You are fabulous, each and every one.

763
01:08:26,532 --> 01:08:28,057
l bless you.

764
01:08:29,703 --> 01:08:31,068
More life.

765
01:08:32,206 --> 01:08:34,106
The great work begins.

766
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:55,653
And don't, please,
start another political discussion.

767
01:08:55,964 --> 01:08:58,558
-That is not walking.
-l know.

768
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,967
We can agree about walking.
