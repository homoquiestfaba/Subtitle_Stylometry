Come, come, come on.

00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,802

6
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,872
Get your ass out the car!

7
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,207
I said get to the back!

8
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,675
Open that motherfucker up.

9
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,311
Get the bag out!

10
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,279
- Come on! Let's go!
Let's get out!

11
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,517
Motherfucker!

12
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,290
What the fuck is this?

13
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,568
- Fuck!
- Downs!

14
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,174
Watch out!

15
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,743
Cass!

16
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,311
- I'm out!
- Stay down!

17
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,482
Shit!

18
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,595
Shit. What do we do?

19
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:47,032
Forget about the bag. Let's get
out of here. Come on, man.

20
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,400
Get in. Let's go.

21
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,276
Let's move. Let's go.
Come on!

22
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,978
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

23
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,213
Damn it!

24
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,782
What the fuck was that?

25
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,237
Shit. What the fuck was that?
Not sure.

26
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,672
Fucking couple guys,
couple kilos.

27
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,640
No, man. That was<i> reservoir
dog</i> shit back there.

28
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,043
I didn't know they was
gonna come in hot like that.

29
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,678
How much is in there?
That bag is heavy.

30
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,814
Shit. Just from my eyes, got to
be 25 or better in here, man.

31
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,584
- Oh, god, there ain't no 25.
- Yeah. Got to be 25 or more.

32
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,652
Man, listen. I ain't got
my calculator with me,

33
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,854
but they got to be seven or
eight million on the streets.

34
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,656
Enough for plastic surgery,
fix your face.

35
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,059
- My face is beautiful. Why change that?
- What you mean?

36
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,027
- Your mask came off. They saw you, nigga.
- It don't matter.

37
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,930
- I like my face. It's a work of art.
- Whatever you say.

38
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,833
It's your life, bro.

39
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,811
<i>It's me. I got called
for a double.</i>

40
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,713
<i>So you got to take
Thomas to his game.</i>

41
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,049
<i>Just come get him
from the hospital at 3:30</i>

42
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,752
<i>and, vin,
don't fuck it up again.</i>

43
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,953
<i>Bye.</i>

44
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,760
Dr. Sorenson.

45
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,963
- Ruby.
- Ruby.

46
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,865
You missed our appointment
this morning.

47
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,534
I cannot approve your return to
the workplace until we talk.

48
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,707
Guys at the department are concerned
about your recent behavior.

49
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,409
The guys at the department?

50
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,711
The whole damn department
is gossiping about me.

51
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,447
Well,

52
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,650
how does that make you feel?

53
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,720
How's that make me feel?
Fucking fantastic.

54
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,426
Why don't you
tell me what happened

55
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,428
in your own words?

56
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,834
Okay.

57
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,503
Say it out loud,
or I'm gonna keep this.

58
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,042
Thought I was walking into
a controlled situation.

59
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,346
Instead, I found myself in the middle
of a meth lab with a pissed-off junkie.

60
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,948
- He assaulted you?
- He kicked my ass.

61
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,351
Okay?
Okay.

62
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,553
Meth labs aren't quiet.
Meth labs stink.

63
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,923
Someone knew the lab was there, and
someone was paid to look the other way.

64
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,558
I hear you.

65
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,394
Good. Good. So you know
I have to get back to work.

66
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,129
I have to figure this thing out.

67
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,932
'Cause this city is
crawling with dirty cops.

68
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,500
Do you hear that?

69
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,108
Bryant.

70
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,609
Okay.

71
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,213
So this is my partner
on the other line.

72
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,215
They found government-issued
bullets at a crime scene.

73
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,185
So can I go do my job, or do you
want to keep talking bullshit?

74
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,157
I'm on my way.

75
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,061
Thank you. I feel
so much better now.

76
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,966
Jennifer.

77
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,039
Morning, lieutenant.

78
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,743
So at 0427, a squad car
got a shots fired call

79
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,912
about the same time
we got a report

80
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,815
about a late-model sedan
speeding near old downtown.

81
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,084
The unit checking out
the shots fired

82
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,920
went into an alley off of third street
where they found two dead bodies.

83
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,756
These responding officers
report casings everywhere.

84
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,493
And I mean everywhere.
Oh, we'll take that.

85
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,760
Me and Cass.

86
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,496
No. I'm giving it
to Emerson and Flannigan.

87
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,232
You want Cagney and Lacey to take
it or you wanna get it solved?

88
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,303
All right, hotshot.
It's yours.

89
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,671
Yeah.

90
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,174
Let's go, partner.

91
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,278
Hey, say, nigga, is you high?
What the fuck are you doing?

92
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,614
Yeah, a little bit. We got
to control this case.

93
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,449
We control the case,
we control the evidence.

94
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,018
That might be smartest shit or
the dumbest shit you ever did.

95
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,521
It might be. The dumbest
shit was this morning.

96
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,802
Looking for this?

97
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,174
I'm looking for everything.

98
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,677
Mm. It's police-issued,
and there's more of 'em.

99
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,745
Looks like the same gun
killed the big guy.

100
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,282
Vincent downs, homicide.

101
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,550
Jennifer Bryant.

102
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,185
That's my partner,
Doug Dennison.

103
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,254
We're internal affairs.

104
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,724
Okay. So that's all you got, huh?
Government-issue?

105
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,594
This one's got an employee
ID from the Luxus casino.

106
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,363
The big guy?
He's a special snowflake.

107
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,998
Arrest records
going back 12 years.

108
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,536
- What happened to your face? -Why
don't you take a closer look?

109
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,771
It's just everybody's been
talking about your situation.

110
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,174
Talk of the town.

111
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,044
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing happened.

112
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,413
This is a face that pays
attention to details.

113
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,617
Speaking of details, I thought Emerson and
Flannigan were assigned to this case.

114
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,219
No, no. Maybe you
shouldn't think, Bryant.

115
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,555
- Me and my partner got the call.
- You did?

116
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,758
Anyway, I was just looking out
for a fellow officer. Mm.

117
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,994
You should put some ice on that.
Yeah.

118
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,196
Yeah. I'll get some for you too.

119
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,410
Ladies and gentlemen,

120
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,778
Nevada's finest.

121
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,613
I feel like I need a shower.

122
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,615
- What'd that guy want?
- He lied to me

123
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,250
when I asked
why he was on the case.

124
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,753
Vegas pd fucking
with an la investigation.

125
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,788
- Got a bulldog.
- Yeah. Love it.

126
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,890
We should look
into that, Sherlock.

127
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,837
<i>Clinical nurse specialist, 613.</i>

128
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,840
<i>Available clinical nurse
specialist, stat, 613, please.</i>

129
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,683
<i>Blood gas tech to CCU, stat.</i>

130
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,951
<i>- Blood gas tech to CCU, stat.</i>
- Hey.

131
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,286
Hey.

132
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,655
I said 3:30. He's got
to be there by 4:00.

133
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,692
Sorry. I was grabbing you some flowers.
That's why I was running late.

134
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,026
Thank you.

135
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,964
What's that?

136
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,234
- I was gonna tell you, but you
kept canceling. -What is this?

137
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,904
What kind of ring is this?
It's an engagement ring.

138
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,972
- It's from Dave? -Yeah, it's Dave.
Who else...

139
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,375
What are you doing?
What am i...

140
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,178
Is this who you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

141
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,580
- Have you thought this out?
- Yeah. Dave shows up.

142
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,249
Dave takes care of your son. I don't
care how many times he shows up.

143
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,585
- He ain't his father. I'm his father.
- I know you are.

144
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:04,122
You gotta respect that, d. Yeah.

145
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,825
So what am I supposed to do?

146
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,828
- He's just supposed to... -just supposed
to come in and take care of your family?

147
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,230
That?
Okay, d.

148
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,432
All right. All right.

149
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,038
Look, he's got to go.
His game is now.

150
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,574
You got to pick him up, 'cause I
got stuff I got to do... no, no.

151
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,275
Not again.
Not again. Not again.

152
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,311
I have to work a double.
You figure it out.

153
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,581
All right, baby, enjoy your dad.

154
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,917
Drop him off by 9:00 pm. Okay?

155
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,487
Give me my flowers back.

156
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,290
9:00 pm. Bye, baby.

157
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,792
Bye.

158
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,764
Hey, son.

159
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,935
Want some flowers?

160
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,880
How come you didn't
tell me about Dave, hmm?

161
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,048
How come you ain't tell me
he coming around more?

162
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,551
You should have told me. Supposed
to be man-to-man on that.

163
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,120
You supposed to let me know what's
going on. Why the hell you care?

164
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,122
Because it's my business
to care.

165
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,725
He's moving in next week.
No, no.

166
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:16,461
No, ain't nobody doing that.
Not doing that. Not doing that.

167
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,264
You need a place to stay, stay with me.
I got plenty of room.

168
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,733
You got room.
Yeah, I got room.

169
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,301
What am I, a piece of furniture?

170
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,905
You don't care where I live,
who I live with.

171
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,507
You were never home
when mom and I lived with you!

172
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,515
You see now...

173
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,452
I love your mom.
I love you.

174
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:45,423
It's just, I mean, things
that... that I can't explain.

175
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,991
It just gets complicated.

176
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,543
Radio don't work.

177
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,185
Take it out.

178
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,022
Remember what I told you
to do with that.

179
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:22,527
You pull that trigger, you better have
your mind made up. You can't take it back.

180
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,295
And whatever you aiming at...

181
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,867
Make sure
you prepared to kill it.

182
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,059
Yeah?

183
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,729
Mr. downs,
this is Stan Rubino.

184
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,098
I learned you have
something that's mine.

185
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,334
The 25 kilos of cocaine
you stole.

186
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,037
Listen, that was a mistake.
I'll get you your product.

187
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,374
Look, if you hurt him...
You know what it is.

188
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,644
Mr. downs, let's not
get carried away.

189
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,680
I guess you know
what kind of man I am.

190
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:19,117
Okay. Okay. I'll get your stuff
and I'll bring it right to you.

191
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,687
In three hours, rob Novak's
coming to pick up 25 kilos.

192
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,222
If I can't deliver,

193
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,458
<i>I'll give him your son instead.</i>
Please.

194
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,761
He's only 16.

195
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:30,929
He's 16.

196
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,497
Yes, I know.

197
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,305
Sheri, how's your mom?

198
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,240
She's better. Thank
you for the flowers.

199
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,275
Ah, it's the least we could do.

200
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,018
Hey, this is Bryant. I need a file
on an officer... Vincent downs.

201
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,254
Contact information,
license plate, family info.

202
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,557
What can you give me
without approval?

203
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,564
Thank you.

204
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,589
Aaah. Whew.

205
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,763
Aaah.

206
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,808
What's up with you?

207
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,078
You all right? Man, where
all this blood come from?

208
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,380
You messed up, Cass.

209
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,314
What you mean?

210
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,016
Stan Rubino got Thomas.

211
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,484
Stan Rubino got Thomas?

212
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,353
- The manager from the Luxus?
- The manager from Luxus.

213
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,921
- You fucked up.
- What the fuck...

214
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,157
We weren't stealing from Rubino.
You were stealing from Novak.

215
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,858
You got us fucked up
in Novak shit!

216
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
- I didn't know...
- How you not know?

217
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,829
They said it was
gonna be an easy grab.

218
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,564
It ain't no easy grab!
They got t!

219
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,034
Man, we gotta... man, they
gonna kill... they gonna...

220
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,036
I know what they doin'!
I need that bag!

221
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,738
You know I wouldn't do
that shit on purpose!

222
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,340
- Then why'd you do it?
- Hey, man, I didn't know!

223
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,043
Man, I love Thomas like he my own!
Had one day with him!

224
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,446
Hey, listen.
I understand you upset.

225
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,848
Man, I'll fix it.
Calm down.

226
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,416
Get the bag.

227
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,021
I can't believe you thought I'd
do some shit like that, man.

228
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,323
I hit you
when I'm on the way back.

229
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,138
Oh, god.

230
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,546
Rob.

231
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,749
You don't have to do this.

232
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,751
We're family, man.

233
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,154
You don't do this
to family, okay? Please!

234
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:48,059
Please. Please. Okay.
I am sorry, okay?

235
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,928
I am so, so sorry.

236
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,396
You don't... please.

237
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,565
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this!

238
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,640
Aaah!

239
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,948
Friend of mine gave me
some cell phone records.

240
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,351
Three weeks ago, two calls.

241
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,922
And five calls Thursday
and four more yesterday

242
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,424
from your phone to the DEA.

243
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,761
- Th-that wasn't me.
- Listen, you dumb motherfucker.

244
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,264
You think that we don't have
people who we pay to tell us

245
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,166
when our relatives
call the fucking DEA?

246
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,102
I'm sorry. Uh, I was with this
girl in agua Prieta, all right?

247
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:35,940
And-and the DEA, they busted us, and
they asked me all these questions.

248
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:39,510
You know what my father always said
about your side of the family?

249
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,446
You only think with your dick.

250
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:46,617
It's always this fat girl
and that fat girl.

251
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,887
And that's why you
turned out so stupid.

252
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,525
'Cause your daddy married
your mom and fucked her.

253
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,534
Sweet lady. But not the kind of face you
want to look at for the rest of your life.

254
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,639
DEA bust.

255
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,243
My cut house raided last week.

256
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,078
The position I'm in,

257
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,414
I got to go begging
a fuck-nut scumbag

258
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,218
like Stanley Rubino
for 25 kilos.

259
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,919
It's embarrassing.

260
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,654
Even worse,

261
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,791
the whole goddamn world
knows I'm vulnerable.

262
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,968
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,838
Yeah, I know you are.

264
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,512
Cut off his tongue.

265
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,881
Make sure he doesn't
ever use it again.

266
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,517
No, no. Rob!
Rob, come back!

267
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,020
You can't do... please! Please!
Please, don't do...

268
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,521
Please don't do this to me!

269
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:01,192
No, no, no, no, no, no.
N-n-no, please...

270
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,695
Come on. Let me out!

271
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,132
Anyone!

272
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,767
Help!

273
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,772
Shit!

274
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,292
Shit.

275
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,129
- Hey, d.
- Where's Thomas, vin?

276
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,730
It's okay.

277
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,732
His coach called, said he missed the game.
Where is he?

278
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,435
Yeah, yeah. He took off
a little while ago.

279
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,671
I think I know where he is.
I'm gonna get him now.

280
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,439
Took off?
He'd never miss a game.

281
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,508
Look, d, t and I
had a little fight.

282
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,778
So, uh, I think he's just
punishing me right now.

283
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,013
- What kind of fight, vin?
- I don't know.

284
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,515
He was just being him.

285
00:21:57,517 --> 00:22:00,084
- And I'm sure you were
just being you. -Yeah.

286
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,587
Look, at the end of the day, I told
him no, he couldn't do something,

287
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,490
<i>he got pissed off, he took off,
so I think I know where he is.</i>

288
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,826
- I'm gonna go get him right now.
- Find him.

289
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,880
<i>First floor.</i>

290
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,338
There.

291
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,740
What the hell's he doing?

292
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,577
<i>First floor.</i>

293
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,431
It's Novak.

294
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,368
Hey, rob.

295
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,604
Yeah, and we're finally
all set here. Right.

296
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,607
Meet you on the floor. Bye.

297
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,487
Follow me.

298
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,603
Police. There was a man
in here a few minutes ago.

299
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,438
- He had a duffel bag.
- I didn't notice.

300
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,006
It was a big duffel bag.

301
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,941
And I'm telling you
I didn't notice.

302
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,677
What are you doing?

303
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,514
This is the men's room.

304
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,950
Okay. Okay.

305
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,151
Okay.

306
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:25,089
There was a guy banging around
just like you in that one.

307
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,728
You should have said
he was black, six-feet-tall,

308
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,363
banging around in the stalls.

309
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,732
- Then I would have known who you
were talking about. -Thanks.

310
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,101
I'll work on my descriptions.

311
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,132
Oh.

312
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,736
Motherfucker.

313
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,905
I knew it.

314
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,133
Where are my drugs?

315
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,602
Where's my son?

316
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,876
Dad!

317
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:53,711
Thomas.

318
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:55,145
What's goin' on?

319
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,580
It's gonna be okay.

320
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,549
Come on, man.

321
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:00,184
You steal from me...

322
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,420
And you kill my guys.

323
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,255
Let's just figure it out.

324
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,191
You stupid shit.

325
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,894
This is the biggest
amount I ever moved.

326
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,896
You think I wouldn't protect
it with everything I've got?

327
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,798
Look, we didn't know
the drugs was yours.

328
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,902
You have no idea what kind
of mess you've made here.

329
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,772
That cocaine is supposed
to go to the Novaks.

330
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,907
You know what
they're capable of.

331
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,745
How am I supposed to
explain this to rob Novak?

332
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,413
Or his father?

333
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,081
If frank gets involved here...

334
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,349
I got your drugs.

335
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,587
I got the rest stashed.

336
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,989
I'll get it to you
when I get my son.

337
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,702
I don't get you, downs.

338
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,106
There's a right way to do things
and a wrong way.

339
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:03,113
I just don't think that you
respect the established protocol.

340
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,017
Yeah.

341
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,954
The right way is how
I usually do things.

342
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,289
Ten minutes.

343
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,759
I'll bring it back
in ten minutes, get my son.

344
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:23,367
- No, where am I going? Dad!
- Ten minutes.

345
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,871
How do I know if I bring you that
coke, you don't give my son back?

346
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,309
Shall we?

347
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:55,833
Hello?

348
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,735
I followed Vincent downs
to the Luxus.

349
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,369
What do you mean you
followed Vincent downs?

350
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,572
We discussed it. You said
he was worth looking into.

351
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,708
Yeah, looking into does not
mean tailing, Nancy drew.

352
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,078
He hid 23 kilos of coke in the
ceiling of the men's bathroom.

353
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
<i>So I'm saying he's
worth looking in to.</i>

354
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,449
Okay, seal off the bathroom.
I'm on my way.

355
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,885
- I took it out of the bathroom.
- You moved evidence

356
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,720
without properly conducting
an investigation?

357
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,889
I moved evidence
because it needed to be moved.

358
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,758
I'm waiting out front for you.

359
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,726
Oh, ho, ho.

360
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:26,897
Oh, you are getting a roll of
police tape for your birthday.

361
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,556
Totally tagged you
in that photo.

362
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,824
Here you go.

363
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,239
Get the stuff now. Meet me in my office.
Five minutes.

364
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,580
Rob.
Stanley.

365
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:17,582
Good to see you.

366
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,985
- Oh, hey, how's the old man?
- He's good.

367
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,998
Ten...

368
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,869
Here we go again.

369
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,706
Whatever you're looking for, that
lady cop was already in there.

370
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,942
Shit!

371
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,044
What do you mean she was
already in there? Huh?

372
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,579
She have a garbage bag?

373
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,348
You don't hear me?

374
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,950
No, huh?

375
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,551
Did she have a gar...

376
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,955
All right, listen.
Listen.

377
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,891
Listen. I need to get
that garbage bag.

378
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,826
You take this.

379
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,561
It's my father's watch.

380
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,265
I need your help.

381
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,200
Please.

382
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,571
Let's get a drink.

383
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,174
No. No.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

384
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,042
I just want to get
my stuff and go.

385
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,613
My guy's bringing the stuff to my office.
Just be a few more minutes.

386
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,320
Something wrong?

387
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,557
No. Everything's fine.

388
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,494
I got a great 25-year-old
bottle of Macallan up there

389
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,829
with your name on it.

390
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,063
What do you say?

391
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,336
Now, you know I don't drink.

392
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,242
- But sure.
- Let's go to your office.

393
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,254
Hey.

394
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,422
This is yours.

395
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,426
Thanks.

396
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,261
Yeah.

397
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,088
Stanley,

398
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,390
how much longer?

399
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,961
A few minutes.

400
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,533
A few minutes?

401
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,138
Here's the thing.

402
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,307
You know my family.

403
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,511
And we got our fingers
in a whole lot of pies.

404
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,947
I mean, shit,

405
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:07,684
who doesn't love a hot,
steaming slice of pie?

406
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,220
Delicious.

407
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,559
But my father, he's a...
He's a big thinker.

408
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,762
We got a new pie
getting baked up.

409
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,931
Canada.

410
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:23,700
What can I say?
He likes snow.

411
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,270
Listen, rob...

412
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,673
No, Stanley, it gets better.

413
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,442
It was supposed to be
a small deal this week...

414
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,312
25 kilos, you know,
just to give them a taste.

415
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:40,117
Then my idiot cousin decides
to become a DEA informant,

416
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,686
and we lose an entire...

417
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,555
Shipment.

418
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:48,859
But me, I step up

419
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:53,897
and I promise my father that
our Canadian pie is safe,

420
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,466
and that I could cover
the shortage

421
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,235
with an extra...

422
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,806
25 kilos.

423
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:06,376
<i>Your</i> 25 kilos.

424
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,215
I was just trying to help.
No, Stanley.

425
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,819
When you made me the offer,
you were helping me out.

426
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:19,656
But when I promised my father
that I had it all covered,

427
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,224
then you became obligated.

428
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,828
So,

429
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,097
where is my goddamn cocaine?

430
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,333
Okay.

431
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:33,403
Can you hold one moment,
please? Thank you.

432
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,172
I'd like to rent
a locker, please?

433
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,407
I'm sorry. Lockers are
reserved for spa guests only.

434
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,775
If you'd like to book a...

435
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,245
I'd like to rent
a locker, please.

436
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,684
Thank you.

437
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,596
<i>First floor.</i>

438
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,911
- Did you check every monitor?
- Yes. I lost him.

439
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,214
Goddamn it.
<i>We got his kid.</i>

440
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,549
He's gonna bring us
our drugs. Stan...

441
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,232
Hey, I thought you said
you'd meet me outside.

442
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,335
I knew he was dirty.
Where is he?

443
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,604
I stayed with the evidence.

444
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,272
Jesus Christ.

445
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,808
First of all, we got a
dead guy who worked here.

446
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,976
Right?
I followed downs here

447
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,111
and see him talking to the
casino manager, Stan Rubino.

448
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:51,681
Then rob Novak and his guys turn up,
and they're meeting with Rubino.

449
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,151
Clearly, this ties in to our
crime scene this morning.

450
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,254
Why? Because we've got a police-issued
bullet at the crime scene,

451
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,256
and because downs comes here

452
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:02,092
and shoves a ton of cocaine
into the bathroom ceiling?

453
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:03,693
Then he killed the guy.

454
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:04,928
Yes.

455
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,430
Okay, he's our guy.

456
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,599
Where'd you put the drugs?

457
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,435
I put them
in a locker in the spa.

458
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,138
Oh, my god. This is nuts.
This is nuts.

459
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,007
We got to get a judge in on this.
No.

460
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,943
If we hang around waiting for
paperwork, we'll miss it. This is big.

461
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,679
We can bring down the Novaks and have
an internal bust at the same time?

462
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,281
- Jennifer...
- I'm right about this.

463
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,583
- Jen...
- I'm fine.

464
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,554
Okay. What do you want to do?

465
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,522
I want to give downs a poke.

466
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,058
Shit.

467
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,226
Hey, d.

468
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,094
Do you have him?
<i>Yeah. Got a text from him.</i>

469
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,930
- Said he was going to meet some shorty
at the Luxus casino. -What girl?

470
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:17,167
You know, the... with the girl. The
girl, uh... the girl he always with.

471
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:18,668
<i>The girl...</i>
He doesn't have a girl.

472
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,670
Maybe he don't want you
to know who the girl is.

473
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,340
I know you, vin,
and I know your voice.

474
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,208
You're not telling me
the whole story, are you?

475
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,445
Don't start that right now. When I
get him, I will call you, okay?

476
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,113
I'll call you
when I got him. Shit.

477
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,581
Look, vin...

478
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,757
<i>Hey, downs.</i>

479
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,626
You know what they say
at the airport.

480
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,227
Never leave your bag unattended.

481
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,629
Bryant, I need that bag.

482
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,531
- Why don't we meet up and talk about it?
- Fuck you!

483
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,833
Okay.

484
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,789
Oh, I gotta get out of here.

485
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,764
Excuse me.

486
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,800
Mr. Rubino has requested
a bottle of cristal

487
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,535
sent to his office, immediately.

488
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:01,104
- Put it on his personal account.
- Okay.

489
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,039
To his office, okay?

490
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,531
Nice of you to finally join us.

491
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,368
What the hell took you so long?

492
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,203
Who the fuck is this?

493
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,005
This is Vincent downs. He's the
man who's got your product.

494
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,408
And why have we been
sitting around waiting on you?

495
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,543
There's a lot
of cops downstairs.

496
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,179
Cops all over the casino.
We need to get out of here.

497
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,382
Casino's always full of cops.

498
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,884
- They follow you?
- Think so.

499
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,154
And, uh, it's narcotics.
They know we're up here.

500
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,189
How do you know
they're narcotics?

501
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,724
'Cause I'm a cop.

502
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,560
Easy.

503
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,835
There something
you want to tell me?

504
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,439
Never a dull moment.

505
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,343
But I didn't know this.
I don't know what's going on.

506
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,011
Truly.

507
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:18,248
Yeah. I know, Stanley.

508
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,582
You never do.

509
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,853
Looking for Mr. Rubino.

510
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,090
I think that's them.

511
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,092
We gotta go.

512
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,760
Gotta get you out of here.

513
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,430
Come on.

514
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,833
These stairs lead to the garage.

515
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,903
Vincent downs.

516
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:41,604
I'll remember that.

517
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,607
You should.

518
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,019
Yeah, get the kid. Bring him
down to the front of the club.

519
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:02,025
Go on, get your son.
Get the fuck out of my casino.

520
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,968
He's waiting on you.

521
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,848
Damn it.
He must still be here.

522
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,517
Did you check with security? No.

523
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,152
All right, I'm on it.

524
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,302
Stop the fucking car.

525
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:49,839
It's sugar.

526
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,610
All right, call everyone. I want
everyone here in ten minutes.

527
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,946
You come with me. You go to the front.
Goddamn it!

528
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,558
Dad.

529
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,193
Hey, son.

530
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,963
You all right?

531
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,565
Yeah.

532
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,235
It's over.

533
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,206
Let's get out of here.

534
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,048
Hey, rob.

535
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,384
What did you think?

536
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,985
'Cause you and my father

537
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,021
partied together when you were
kids that I wouldn't kill you?

538
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,356
What's your problem? I was
just trying to help you out.

539
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,558
You needed some product.

540
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,327
You didn't give me product.
You gave me sugar.

541
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,929
- What?
- Your cop.

542
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,998
He fucked you!

543
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,436
I... i... I have his kid. He'll
bring the drugs. I'll just...

544
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,504
I'll just...

545
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:58,308
Just give me some time.

546
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,610
Huh?

547
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,746
Then what are you waiting for?

548
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,120
Yeah?

549
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:14,390
- Do you still have the kid?
- No. I just let him go.

550
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,525
Well, get him back!

551
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:17,193
Shit.

552
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,595
What's goin' on?

553
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,764
Don't worry about it. What do
you mean don't worry about it?

554
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,936
Shit. Why is he
coming back?

555
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,574
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

556
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,643
Um, yeah.

557
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,847
Come on.
Let's go this way.

558
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:41,951
Which way?

559
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,628
Fuck!

560
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,768
What? What?

561
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,403
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

562
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,773
Oh, shit!

563
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,908
It's just a cut. It's just a cut.
I'll be okay.

564
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,044
Just give me a minute.

565
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,249
You stole drugs from them?

566
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,085
What you talking about?
That's why you're never home.

567
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,153
This your overtime?

568
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,155
Thought you out
doing something good,

569
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,724
and you over here
fucking selling drugs.

570
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,263
It's a case.

571
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,432
Listen,

572
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,234
I'm telling you, t,

573
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,104
I'm undercover.

574
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:38,007
I've been working this case for
two years, and I'm almost...

575
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,209
I almost got it done. That's
why I haven't been around.

576
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:43,012
That's why I haven't been able to take
you to your games or whatever that is.

577
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,515
And I apologize for that.

578
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,284
You're the only one
that knows. Okay?

579
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:50,720
So you got to stay close,
and we gonna get out of this.

580
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:53,156
You just gotta trust me.

581
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:54,390
Yeah.

582
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,028
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on!

583
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,437
Come on, dad! Come on!

584
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:09,405
Get up!

585
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,042
Watch out!

586
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,279
Come on, dad!

587
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,245
Dad! Dad!

588
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,780
Oh, shit!

589
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,499
Dad. Come on, dad.

590
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,970
This way.

591
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,388
Yes, sir. I understand.

592
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,559
I appreciate that.

593
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,261
Yes, sir.

594
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,175
Any sign of him?

595
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,514
I spoke with my father.

596
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,983
If we don't have the coke
in the next four hours,

597
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,452
he's cutting his vacation
short and coming home.

598
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:42,491
I want you to tell
every cop on our payroll

599
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:48,197
that I will pay to see Vincent downs
and his partner on their knees.

600
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,211
Move!

601
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,087
Get the fuck outta the way!
Come here!

602
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,923
- Thomas!
- Dad! Dad!

603
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,393
I swear to god, you little shit!

604
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,728
If you make a scene,
I'll fucking kill you!

605
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:55,364
Thomas! Move.
Move. Thomas!

606
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:00,970
Thomas!

607
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,940
Good news.

608
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,709
Got his son back.

609
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:09,512
I expect this will all be
wrapped up momentarily.

610
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,551
What are you
doing here, Stanley?

611
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,454
You have a job.

612
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,157
A good one.

613
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:23,326
Yeah.

614
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:26,295
Looks like you've done
pretty damn well for yourself.

615
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:33,302
Let me have a water, please.

616
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,644
From what I buy from you
for the clients here,

617
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,680
I, uh... i save a little
back every month.

618
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,552
That 25 kilos was
my... safety net.

619
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:53,222
And why do you need
a safety net?

620
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:58,694
When you hang with scumbags...

621
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,330
You need a safety net.

622
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,332
Good answer.

623
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,709
What's that?

624
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,078
Open it.

625
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,624
Is that a...
Tongue?

626
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,793
Yeah.

627
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,061
Jesus.

628
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,629
My cousin's.

629
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,999
So look.

630
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:39,135
Mmm.

631
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:41,103
My family...

632
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,539
We have a lot of friends.

633
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:47,543
So there's gonna be
nowhere that you can go

634
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,212
that we won't be able
to find you.

635
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,215
So I'm giving you one hour.

636
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,085
One.

637
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,159
Hang on to the box.

638
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:06,395
I want you to keep it
so it'll remind you

639
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,465
of what happens when people think
that they're smarter than me.

640
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,252
Fuck! Fuck!

641
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,591
You get him?
<i>No.</i>

642
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,193
And the product
ain't here either.

643
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,361
- Shit! -Just come down and
meet me at the Luxus.

644
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:41,130
<i>Just get here now.</i>

645
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,039
- What the fuck?
- Who are you?

646
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,407
Ain't nobody.

647
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,709
Ho. You can't be
in here.

648
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,579
Right. You're right.
I'm not even here.

649
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:59,815
Hmm. Right. Looks official.
You're not coming in here.

650
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:02,418
Look, you got three options:
Either you let me pass,

651
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,720
or I'll whup your funny-looking
ass or I can arrest you.

652
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,255
Hmm.

653
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:08,557
Arrest me... oh!

654
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,097
John Travis.

655
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,248
I'm going to the garage, see if I
can find something in his car.

656
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,616
Check the front desk.
No.

657
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,417
Maybe they saw him.
We're done.

658
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:37,520
We have searched
every inch of this casino.

659
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:40,222
Vincent downs is long gone.
All right? He beat us.

660
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,327
Are you okay?

661
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,633
You know, a guy
gets beat up on the job,

662
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,435
and everyone congratulates him
on the size of his balls.

663
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:55,271
If I get hit, everyone acts like

664
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:57,506
I need tape and a shrink
to get put back together.

665
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,842
No, you know what?
This isn't about this.

666
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,443
It's about your state of mind.

667
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:04,346
You missed things that
were right in front of you

668
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,949
and put yourself in the wrong
place at the wrong time

669
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:08,184
and almost got yourself killed.

670
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,352
I am in the right place
at the right time.

671
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,689
We've got a dirty cop in the middle
of a deal between Rubino and Novak,

672
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:17,293
and they're associating in public,
which means they are not afraid.

673
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:19,328
Okay.
Someone is protecting them.

674
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,630
Okay. Point taken.

675
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:25,334
And in the morning, we will
start a formal investigation.

676
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:28,337
But tonight, I am gonna take
the labs to the precinct

677
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:32,241
and then I am going
to call it a night.

678
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,683
Fine. I'll take the drugs
into evidence.

679
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:41,717
Jen.

680
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,553
Go home.

681
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,789
Get some sleep.

682
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,797
Fine.

683
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,668
Get some rest, honey.

684
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,116
<i>First floor.</i>

685
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,584
Going up.

686
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,752
I'll wait.

687
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,599
Twenty-seven.
Back off! Police!

688
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:35,504
<i>-Twenty-seventh floor.</i>

689
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,478
Come on, come on.

690
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,718
<i>Twenty-seventh...</i>

691
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,966
What the fuck
are you doin'? Aaah!

692
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:39,868
Fuck! Aaah!

693
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,970
What are you doing?
I'm trying to get to my son.

694
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:44,940
- You dirty son of a bitch.
- You put a gun on me...

695
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,872
I knew you were a dirty cop!

696
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,378
- You don't get it.
I'm internal affairs.

697
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,846
I know everyone in la.

698
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:26,815
You don't know shit.

699
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,485
You thought you were busting
a captain from Bolden command.

700
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:31,720
Instead, you ran into a cutter
with a nasty right hook.

701
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,722
Someone takes a dump in my
department, I know about it.

702
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,091
They're shittin' all over it.

703
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,993
I'm off the books.

704
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:41,029
I've been working undercover for
two years... two fuckin' years!

705
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:44,032
You know what that means?
Two fuckin' years!

706
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,168
Ain't seen my wife, my kid!
They don't know about it!

707
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,236
Father of the year.

708
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,004
Yeah, I'm the father
of the year.

709
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:51,907
My partner, Sean Cass,
he is a courier for the Novaks.

710
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,742
He's giving somebody
in the department kickbacks.

711
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,677
Somebody higher up. That's
what I'm trying to figure out.

712
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,212
You're not convincing me.

713
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:59,047
Then why did
your bust go bad, huh?

714
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:02,184
You did all the right shit, all the
right police shit, and it all went bad.

715
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,019
Why? Because somebody at the
department tipped them off.

716
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,754
I don't believe a word
you fucking say!

717
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,023
Don't have to fuckin' believe
what I'm sayin'.

718
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:11,860
But you're gonna learn today.
Come on! Get over here!

719
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:13,862
They've got my son, Thomas.
He's 16 years old.

720
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:15,864
If I don't give 'em the drugs,
they'll kill him!

721
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,100
Someone kidnapped your son.
Why don't you call for backup?

722
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,269
Because I can't trust anybody!
Where are them drugs?

723
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:21,970
- Fuck you!
- I'm gonna kill you, Bryant!

724
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:24,873
I'll kill you! Tell me
where them drugs are!

725
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,141
Where they at?

726
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,546
Huh?

727
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:31,747
The women's spa.

728
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:32,781
Where?

729
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,152
Locker 32,
but I don't have the key.

730
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,489
Fuck!

731
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,391
I'm sorry!

732
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:45,060
Fuck you!

733
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,463
Fuck. Fuck!

734
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,341
Are you in on this
with your father?

735
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:35,711
Hey, man, it ain't my fault you
assholes ain't think this through.

736
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,580
Us assholes.

737
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,683
Us assholes?

738
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,907
All right, all right.

739
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,085
Oh, okay.
That's it. Okay.

740
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,393
Oh-oh-six...

741
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:00,929
Yeah?

742
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,031
- Downs is still here!
- What?

743
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:06,969
He's headed to the locker in the spa.
Go now. Get that motherfucker!

744
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,537
Goddamn it.

745
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:10,839
Come on, come on, come on!

746
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,344
I need the key to locker 32.

747
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,781
I need the key to locker 32.

748
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:25,954
Thank you.

749
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,329
Shit!

750
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,132
Freeze! Police!

751
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,900
Hands against the lockers!
Shut up!

752
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:41,236
Get your fuckin' hands
against the lockers!

753
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,739
I don't have time for this.
Shut your mouth.

754
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,741
Eyes front.
Shut your mouth.

755
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:48,110
I know what to do. Keep
your goddamn mouth shut!

756
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:50,979
Fuck. That's how you do it? Huh?
That's how you do it?

757
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:58,720
Oh, my god!

758
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,778
Fuck.

759
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,578
Oh, fuck.

760
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,470
Hey! Dad!

761
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:57,572
Thomas. Where are you?

762
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:59,574
I got away.
Stole this phone.

763
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:01,343
Look...
Look, you need to wait.

764
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,046
- Just tell me where you are.
- I'm in this club.

765
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:07,816
Thomas, I want you to stay there.
I'm on my way.

766
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:09,751
- Dad, I'm scared.
- I know, I know.

767
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:12,454
There's a lot of things I gotta
explain to you. I apologize.

768
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:13,922
Dad?

769
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:15,557
- Thomas?
- Dad?

770
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,225
- Hello?
- Thomas?

771
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,096
Shit! Shit.

772
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:23,064
Fuck. Fuck.

773
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,846
I'm only right
if downs shows up.

774
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,153
Sc.

775
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,189
- I'm pullin' in.
- Yeah, you got a uniform?

776
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,324
<i>Yeah, I got one.</i> Good.
Meet me in the garage.

777
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,826
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

778
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,164
Yeah, I know.

779
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,632
I know.

780
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,267
Ugh. Hey, Bryant.

781
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,171
So I got, uh,
good news and bad news.

782
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,439
Security?

783
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,520
Damn.
Look like shit, partner.

784
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:19,888
I know.
You got the uniform?

785
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,357
Yeah, uniform in the car.
Front seat.

786
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:30,565
- Tell me you're not
internal affairs.

787
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,803
Got the gun. Ain't in there. Give
me some answers, you'll get...

788
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:37,005
What difference does it make?

789
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:39,307
They got Thomas.
I'm fucked anyway.

790
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,643
We been friends 20 years.
You gonna rat on me?

791
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:43,311
What do you mean rat on you?

792
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:46,147
I got all the information on you
and could've took you down.

793
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:47,983
I'm protecting you.
You're protecting me?

794
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:49,417
You internal affairs, nigga!

795
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:51,519
That's what I'm trying
to make you understand.

796
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:55,490
You gotta rock with me. I'll get Thomas...
and I'll fix all this shit.

797
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,492
But you gotta help me.

798
01:04:57,494 --> 01:04:58,994
Downs!

799
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:00,395
Put the fucking gun down!

800
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,498
Sean! Sean!

801
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,200
Stay with me! Sean!

802
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:06,234
Come on!

803
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,503
Stay with me, Sean.
Stay with me.

804
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:09,604
Shit.

805
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,606
Stay with me.
Look at me. Sean.

806
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,777
Sean!

807
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:17,412
Damn it!

808
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,482
Fuck!

809
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,962
First thing anybody says when they
go down is, "I'm undercover."

810
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:37,198
The guy hid 23 kilos of cocaine
in the ceiling of the bathroom,

811
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,467
he assaulted me
and he tied you up.

812
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:41,803
This sound like the actions
of a straight shooter to you?

813
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,471
I agree. Still,
there's something more.

814
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:46,875
He knew things about me, my case.
Even if he's lying.

815
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,380
You never checked the garage.

816
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,583
What, you... you okay?

817
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:57,953
You wanna talk to someone?
Oh, fuck you!

818
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,264
- Hey. -What the
hell is going on?

819
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:12,467
<i>- It's all good.</i> -I've been calling
Thomas's phone for an hour.

820
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,135
I didn't want
to worry you, okay?

821
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,571
Where are you? <i>I'm still
at the Luxus casino.</i>

822
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,977
What the fuck is going on, vin?
<i>Listen.</i>

823
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,845
Everything I do
is about you and him.

824
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:25,447
You know it's always
been that, right?

825
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:28,183
<i>I would never let anything bad
happen to either of you.</i>

826
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:29,851
<i>Please, you gotta trust me, d.</i>

827
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:30,986
Baby, you're scaring me.

828
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:34,322
Yeah. Uh, listen.

829
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:38,159
I gotta call you right back.
<i>Vin?</i>

830
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,563
What the fuck?

831
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,009
Dena?

832
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,512
<i>You have one new message.</i>

833
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,849
<i>Yeah, it's Dennison.
I have the product.</i>

834
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:02,517
<i>Stay in the garage. I'm coming.</i>

835
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,285
<i>Vincent downs
is internal affairs.</i>

836
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:05,787
<i>He's five degrees
from fingering us.</i>

837
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:09,791
<i>You created the mess this morning.
Now you clean it up.</i>

838
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:11,626
<i>Take downs out.</i>

839
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:13,595
<i>Now!</i>
Fuck!

840
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,733
Motherfucker.

841
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,370
Shit, there's another one.

842
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:38,987
Dennison.

843
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:41,222
Shh, shh!

844
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,225
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

845
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,367
Does Vincent downs
know who I am?

846
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:55,503
Go fuck yourself.

847
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,540
It's Bryant here.
We've got a 187.

848
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,775
Parking garage
at the Luxus casino.

849
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,316
- How's your guy?
- He's gone.

850
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,688
You see any shell casings
over there?

851
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,690
No.

852
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,134
Mine's dead too.

853
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,105
It's, uh, Sean Cass.

854
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:32,273
Vincent downs's partner.

855
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,051
You called it in, right?

856
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:45,153
Yeah.
Okay. Um...

857
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,458
Stay with the bodies.
I'm gonna lead 'em in.

858
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:45,046
You trying to take me down?

859
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:47,115
Look, you go down,
I go down, all right?

860
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:49,450
If I go down,
you'll be dead in a week.

861
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:52,387
Listen.
Got a folder on my desk.

862
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,289
It's got every name
of every cop,

863
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,157
every detail of every job
I did for you.

864
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,359
Now, if I die, that folder...

865
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:00,528
You...

866
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,898
Your daddy,

867
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,201
your fuckin' family,

869
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,939
You can't touch me.

870
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:21,649
Yeah.

871
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,285
But we're paying you a lot
of money to protect us.

872

And you're not doing your job.

873
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,491
Just do your fuckin' job.

874
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:33,528
Or I think you're gonna
realize there's a lot of ways

875
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,396
that my family can touch you.

876

used against you in a court of law.
