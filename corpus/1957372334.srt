137

00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,644
Uh-uh, Troy,
do not start with that.

139
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:06,312
Sure, sure, sure, but why'd
you have to choose a place

140
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:08,281
that used to be called
Smokey Hollow?

141
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,183

then what is it?

Uh, Combat Alley?

143
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:12,352
And what's it called now?

144
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:13,920
ANTHONY:
Cabrini-Green.

145
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:15,622
It was the projects.

146
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:16,556
It was affordable housing

147
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:18,758
that had a particularly
bad reputation.

148
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,226
You would never know.

149
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,427
ANTHONY:
Yeah, because they tore it down

150
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:22,762
and gentrified
the shit out of it.

151
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,365
Translation:
White people built the ghetto

152
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:26,633
and then erased it,

153
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,868
when they realized
they built the ghetto.

154
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,903
- Ooh, no offense.
- None taken.

155
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:31,904
TROY:
They took the opportunity

156
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,406
to make it livable.

157
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:34,907
I could have got you
a better conversion.

158
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,343
They kept telling people
they were gonna make it better,

159
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:38,645
moving 'em from place to place,

160
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,580
but really they were
just tearing it down,

161
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:42,915
so they could develop
everything around it.

162
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,651
Oh, like here.

00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:33,866
on the urban legends
of Cabrini-Green.

179
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:38,738
<i>For research, she came down to
Cabrini a few times, you know.</i>

180
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:41,441
<i>Asking questions,
taking pictures of graffiti,</i>

181
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:43,309
- <i>of people.</i>
- <i>(camera whirs)</i>

182
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:46,512
<i>And then, one day,</i>

183
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:48,715
- <i>she just...</i>
- <i>(bee buzzing)</i>

184
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:50,750
<i>snaps.</i>

185
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:54,320
<i>She beheaded a Rottweiler.</i>

186
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,355
<i>By the time the police show up,</i>

187
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,724
<i>she's in one of the apartments,</i>

188
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:00,493
<i>doing snow angels
in a pool of blood.</i>

189
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:01,828
- Ew.
- Okay, bullshit.

190
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,463
- BRIANNA: Troy.
- ANTHONY: I call bullshit.

191
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:04,697
Where do you get this from?

192
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:06,265
There's no way
she killed a Rottweiler?

193
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:07,533
Yeah, this is extra,
even for you.

194
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:08,634
There are articles written
about this.

195
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,002
- Look it up.
- (Brianna scoffs)

196
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:12,271
TROY:
The authorities take her in,

197
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,873
but she escapes
almost immediately.

198
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,676
<i>She goes on a rampage.</i>

199
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,580
<i>Leaving a trail of bodies
in her wake and then,</i>

200
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,348
<i>the baby of one of the residents</i>

201
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,916
- <i>is abducted.</i>
- <i>(baby crying)</i>

202
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,551
<i>The mother is devastated.</i>

203
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,754
<i>Everyone is looking for him,</i>

204
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,756
and nothing.

205
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,891
<i>On the night
of the annual bonfire,</i>

206
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:35,361
<i>with all of the residents
of Cabrini watching,</i>

207
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:37,663
<i>Helen arrives...</i>

208
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:41,734
- <i>with a sacrificial offering.</i>
- <i>(baby crying)</i>

209
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,670
Baby in her arms,
she runs towards the fire,

210
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:46,572
<i>but they're on her quick.</i>

211
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,040
They say she was in a,
in a fugue state,

212
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,042
fighting back, blindly.

213
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:52,578
But they got the baby free.

214
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,047
<i>While everyone
is fussing over him,</i>

215
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,783
- <i>Helen stands up</i>
- <i>(baby crying)</i>

216
00:10:56,816 --> 00:11:00,553
- <i>and walks right into the fire.</i>
- <i>(flames crackling)</i>

217
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:03,790
And it's on that spot
that she dies,

218
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,424
<i>burns to death,</i>

219
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,628
<i>right in the middle
of Cabrini-Green.</i>

220
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:14,500
(gasps) Is my rosé
still in the freezer?

221
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,903
You don't want the Moscato?

222
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:20,506
- Moscato's a dessert wine.
- (Anthony chuckles)

223
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,943
- Bye, Bree-Bree. Mm.
- Mwah.

224
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,511
BRIANNA: Love you.
So nice to meet you.

225
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:26,746
TROY:
And, Anthony, get painting.

226
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:27,847
My sister's not trying
to support you

227
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,415
the rest of her life.

228
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,583
Put down those weights,
pick up them brushes.

229
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,418
- BRIANNA: Troy...
- TROY: Come on.

230
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,419
He's funny.

231
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:36,823
He is ridiculous.

232
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,458
He is right.

233
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,832

- BRIANNA: I'm just glad Troy's

234
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:48,467
- finally dating someone normal.
- (turns off water)

235
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,536
I was getting exhausted
trying to keep up

236
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,440
with all those
European fashion designers.

237
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,776
(singsongy):
Hello?

238
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,779
What time is Clive
coming tomorrow?

239
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,814
10:00 a.m.

240
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:05,017
You feeling good
about what you're showing?

241
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,854
Uh... I think so.

242
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:08,988
Uh...

243
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,857
Some stuff he might enjoy.

244
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,892
BRIANNA:
Mm... Hmm.

245
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:15,094
Okay, okay.

246
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,696
(both grunt)

247
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,564
Huh.

248
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:23,002
I guess she did kill
a Rottweiler. Damn,

249
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,570
I don't care.

250
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,173
I'm not trying
to get creeped out

251
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:29,475
in my new apartment before bed.

252
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:32,612
Your new apartment
is ghost-proof.

253
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,113
It was on the Zillow listing.

254
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,749
- Our new apartment.
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,651
Sorry. Mm.

Uh, well... (chuckles)

262
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,970
CLIVE: This is Anthony McCoy
of two years ago.

263
00:12:58,004 --> 00:12:59,972
I want the Anthony McCoy
of the future.

264
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:01,841

of tomorrow.

266
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:06,112
That's the guy
that I gave a solo show to

267
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:08,080
straight outta grad school.

268
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:11,050

don't want to have to go through

269
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,920
the trouble of replacing you
in the summer show,

270
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,621
but you're the only person
who hasn't shown me

271
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:17,890
what I'm actually putting up.

272
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:20,693
I'm working on something new.

275
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:25,932
doing something
about the projects.

276

white supremacy...

White people.

278
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,904
Yeah, how it-it creates
these spaces

279
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:34,540

for communities of color,

280
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:35,808
in particular,
Black communities.

281
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,109
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

282
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:38,511

- Eh,

283
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,446

358
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,440

that it was unrecognizable,

431
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:06,044

the story started.

432
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:08,748
About them seeing him
around Cabrini.

About him coming to get you.

434

Over time, his name disappears,

435
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:17,290

the Candyman.

HELEN (on recording): <i>Some of
the things that have happened</i>

739
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,195
in Cabrini over the years,

740
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:59,632
violence just so extreme,
so bizarre.

741
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:04,069
It's almost as if violence
became the ritual.

742
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:05,305
The worst part,

743
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:08,341
the residents are afraid
to call the police.

744
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:11,411
A code of honor, perhaps,
fear of the police themselves.

745
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:14,614
The easy answer is always,
"Candyman did it."

746
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:17,417
The summoning game itself
could be connected.

747
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,620
I mean, it's clear that
no one person makes this up.

748
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,523
This grew from the community's
collective subconscious.

749
00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:26,726
A survival tool
evolved from the need

750
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:28,161
to protect itself

751
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:29,462

how effective it can be.

The suggestion that you're
being followed or stalked

758
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:45,712

in your own reflection.

00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:19,265
- I'm sorry.
- (scoffs)

1066
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,201
Bri.

1067
00:57:26,706 --> 00:57:29,074
I'm glad you're here.

1068
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:31,744
And you can stay
as long as you want,

1069
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:35,448
on the condition you don't try
and summon Candyman.

1070
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:38,116
Who would do that?

1071
00:57:38,151 --> 00:57:40,118
- (school bell ringing)
- What's up, girl?

1072
00:57:40,153 --> 00:57:42,488
(students chattering
and laughing)

1073
00:57:44,691 --> 00:57:47,460
(boys exclaim and laugh)

1074
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:49,662
SAMANTHA: Trina was
fooked up this weekend.

1075
00:57:49,696 --> 00:57:51,364
ANNIKA: Guys, what should I do
about my bangs?

1076
00:57:51,397 --> 00:57:52,565

Annika, look at this.

1078
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,236
Trina's fucking trashed. Look.
Watch, watch, watch, watch.

Have you guys heard of Candyman?

1086
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,317
Fuck this. I changed my mind.

1087
00:58:11,351 --> 00:58:12,619
- I'm not gonna do...
- Oh, come on, Boof.

1088
00:58:12,652 --> 00:58:13,553
Don't be a pussy.

1089
00:58:13,586 --> 00:58:15,888
Why not? It's a warm

1090
00:58:15,922 --> 00:58:17,790
Oh, Boof,
we're already in formation.

- Fine.
- Okay, ready?

1092
00:58:19,525 --> 00:58:21,160
Candyman.

1093
00:58:21,194 --> 00:58:23,229

1094
00:58:25,898 --> 00:58:28,267
ALL:
Candyman.

1095
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:30,603

One more.

1168

We've been trying to move
in a fresher direction

1169
01:02:08,155 --> 01:02:09,689
for the past few years,

1170
01:02:09,722 --> 01:02:11,724
and our last curator
was a great guy,

1171
01:02:11,757 --> 01:02:13,726
but just had a hard time
getting there.

1172
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,696
Well, I've certainly noticed
a shift in programming

1173
01:02:16,729 --> 01:02:18,064
since you started here.

1174
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:19,899
Hopefully for the best.

1175
01:02:19,932 --> 01:02:22,702
I'm so happy I finally got
to meet you at Jack's dinner.

1176
01:02:22,735 --> 01:02:24,437
Yes. And you know what?

1177
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,938
I think he's been trying to
get us together before that...

1178
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:28,741
It's crazy about Clive.

1179
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:31,010
I heard you were the one
to find the bodies.

1180
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:34,147
- Yeah, um... uh...
- (guide speaking indistinctly)

1181
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:35,915
You've really emerged

1182
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:39,685
as an interesting figure
amidst all this.

1183
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:42,488
The show you put together
sounded so good, too.

1184
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:45,057
You were so brave
to embrace formlessness...

1185
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:48,094
Well, actually,
there were a lot of bodies...

1186
01:02:48,127 --> 01:02:49,896
mm, figures in the show.

1187
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:51,797
Like Arnold's work.

1188
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:54,934
For so long,
abstraction has been about

1189
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:56,936
indexing a sublimated
emotional state,

1190
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:59,071
and I just wanted
to focus on the body.

1191
01:02:59,105 --> 01:03:00,706
Oh, of course, but I mean,

1192
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,176
between the recent tragedies
and your father's legacy,

1193
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:06,479
you've got a fascinating story.

1194
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:08,148
Right.

1195
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:10,650
And your eye
for emerging talent.

1196
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:14,053
How long have you worked
with Anthony McCoy?

1197
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:15,788
Just a couple years.

1198
01:03:15,821 --> 01:03:20,059
My board members are <i>buzzing</i>
about McCoy's work.

1199
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:22,028
Feels like a Project Room show

1200
01:03:22,061 --> 01:03:24,563
is something we could
start talking about.

1201
01:03:24,597 --> 01:03:25,998
(departing footsteps)

1202
01:03:26,032 --> 01:03:29,435

artist you have your eye on.

link to the art world murders,

1207

in particular,
a piece called <i>Say My Name,</i>

1208
01:03:48,654 --> 01:03:50,190
which was written
in the victims' blood

1209
01:03:50,223 --> 01:03:51,557

01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:55,561
What?

1212
01:03:55,594 --> 01:03:58,631
I saw in your file
you were born here.

1213
01:04:00,267 --> 01:04:03,002
I was born on the South Side.

1214
01:04:03,035 --> 01:04:07,106
Mm... No, it says
you were born here.

1215
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,109
Regardless, it is good that
you came in when you did.

1216
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:11,877
We need to admit you immediately

1217
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:14,647
(fading): for monitoring
and do some more testing.

1218
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,049

(rain pattering)

1224
01:04:55,322 --> 01:04:57,623
What happened to your hand?

1225
01:04:57,656 --> 01:04:59,759
Looks bad.

1226
01:05:00,893 --> 01:05:05,097
Went to River North Memorial,
near Cabrini.

1227
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:08,534
They fixed me right up.

1228
01:05:10,303 --> 01:05:12,972
You been paintin'?

1229
01:05:13,005 --> 01:05:13,973

1232
01:05:20,746 --> 01:05:22,681
You want some tea?

1233
01:05:22,715 --> 01:05:25,785
I heard a story about a fire.

1234
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:29,622
Killed a woman named Helen Lyle.

1235
01:05:29,655 --> 01:05:32,325

to call Candyman.

Don't.

1239

Don't say that.

1240
01:05:43,969 --> 01:05:47,073
You told me I was born
on the South Side.

1241
01:05:47,106 --> 01:05:49,975
I did raise you
in the home you remember.

1242
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:55,148
But you were born
in River North Memorial

1243
01:05:55,182 --> 01:05:58,684
and spent the first two years
in Cabrini.

1244
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:01,620
Why did you lie?

1245
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:04,857
To protect you.

1246
01:06:08,994 --> 01:06:10,863
From what?

1247
01:06:13,366 --> 01:06:18,371
I just wanted you
to grow up happy

1248
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:20,873
and normal.

1249
01:06:26,313 --> 01:06:28,881
Do I look normal, Mama?

1250
01:06:33,819 --> 01:06:37,224
- (grunts softly)
- I have to know.

1251
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:39,625

the one who did it.

in that fire.

1272
