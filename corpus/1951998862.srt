1
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>In 1944, a demon was summoned
to Earth to wage war.</i>

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,280
<i>But the child of Hell was rescued
by good men who taught him honour,</i>

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,560
<i>kindness and a sense of right.</i>

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>The scientists and researchers
who gathered around the boy</i>

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,840
<i>became the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defence,</i>

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,560
<i>an international organisation
that protects the world</i>

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,960
<i>from occult and supernatural threats.</i>

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,320
<i>There are things
that go bump in the night.</i>

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,800
<i>They are the ones
who bump back.</i>

10
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,160
(Coughs)

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,560
- Are you all right?
- You know, water isn't really my element.

12
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,880
We must be somewhere
under the temple complex.

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,640
Hmm, so the sun worshippers
forced the bat guys underground?

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,800
Quite literally, it would seem.

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
- All set?
- Sure.

16
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Can't wait.

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,240
Ugh.

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,120
Slime.

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,480
Do you feel air movement?

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,480
(Coughs)

21
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,040
Yeah. And something dead.

22
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Very dead.

23
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Well, we know what happened
to Agent Hamilton.

24
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,480
Mystery solved, I guess.
Did you know him?

25
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,400
No. But I understand he has family.

26
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,880
I guess we should... Oh.

27
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,640
Cute.

28
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,880
So, what do you think
we're looking for?

29
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,440
Ohh, I hope not.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Yeah, so where is Hellboy, anyway?

31
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Unh!

32
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,120
Agh!

33
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
(Groans)

34
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,280
(Roars)

35
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,880
Oh, crap.

36
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880
(Bays)

37
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Unh! Agh!

38
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,040
- Well, this shouldn't be too hard.
- Yeah, right.

39
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
(Creatures moan)

40
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
Uhh, screw this.

41
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
(Roars)

42
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,160
Fine, have it your way!

43
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,400
Liz! This isn't working!

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
We can do this!

45
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,560
- Liz!
- OK, OK.

46
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,200
(Snorts, growls)

47
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,640
(Roars)

48
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,280
(Plaintive roar)

49
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,000
(Growled lament)

50
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,760
Pull it back, Liz!

51
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,440
Pull it back!

52
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Liz.

53
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,240
Liz. Liz!

54
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,240
It's me, kiddo.

55
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,240
You did good. It's over.

56
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,120
So, what'd I miss?

57
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Urrh!

58
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
Uh!

59
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,760
Beautiful!

60
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
So beautiful!

61
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,080
As for this,

62
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,080
it is something which happened.

63
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,240
The brothers of the dragons,

64
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,920
Thunder and Lightning,

65
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,200
brought their wrath upon the lands

66
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,920
of a powerful Daimyo,

67
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,880
smashing them
with their terrible weapons.

68
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,320
The war hammer of Thunder
made mountains crumble

69
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,920
and the forests tremble in fear.

70
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,840
His brother, Lightning,

71
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,760
wielded a flashing spear of white fire

72
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,440
which scorched the earth
and boiled the sea.

73
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,840
The Daimyo was helpless
before these monsters.

74
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,880
To save his lands, he offered them
what was most precious to him:

75
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,480
His daughter,

76
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,360
a fragile flower,

77
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
as pale as the moon,

78
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,000
and as beautiful as the stars.

79
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,520
But the Daimyo had
a brave samurai in his service

80
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,880
who loved the daughter.

81
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,960
Knowing the Daimyo's plan
was to sacrifice the girl,

82
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,880
the samurai sent her
to a shrine deep in the woods

83
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,040
where she would
be hidden from the monsters.

84
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,840
So when the demons
came to collect their prize,

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,440
they found not the beautiful daughter,

86
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,960
but a samurai warrior
ready to protect his love.

87
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,560
Thunder and Lightning
split the sky with their anger.

88
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,880
Pounding rain fell like daggers
upon the samurai.

89
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,280
But he did not weaken.

90
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,760
(Gasps)

91
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,800
Aagh! Urgh! Argh!

92
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,480
It seemed the demons
could not be stopped.

93
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,280
They would break
the samurai into pieces.

94
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,800
But the samurai sword

95
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,400
had been inscribed with ancient words
of great enchantment.

96
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,440
The samurai sword drank deeply
of the blood of the storm demons.

97
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,960
Its magic trapped them
in its blade forever.

98
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
The monsters were gone from his land

99
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
but the Daimyo was angered
by the samurai's trick.

100
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,960
His promise to the demons
had been broken.

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,760
No matter how onerous the bargain,

102
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,960
the Daimyo had given his word.

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And the samurai had broken it.

104
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,760
The samurai left to join his love at the shrine

105
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,480
and never return.

106
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,840
The dishonour to the Daimyo's house

107
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,200
could not be undone.

108
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,080
There could only be retribution.

109
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,440
The Daimyo beseeched the gods
to ease his shame,

110
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,560
and the gods answered.

111
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
(Knocking)

112
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,560
Professor Sakai?

113
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,240
- Hiramatsu...
- Professor!

114
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,840
Just rest a moment,
and I'll fetch you some tea.

115
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you, Toshiro.

116
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,720
I can be foolish sometimes.

117
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,360
I get lost in my work.

118
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,440
It's too late. I can come back.

119
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
Nonsense, Professor.

120
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,640
You are here
and so are my swords.

121
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,160
You academics,

122
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,800
drawing strength
from your studies of artefacts.

123
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,720
Sifting through the rice sacks of folklore
after a single grain of truth.

124
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm sure I know
the sword you want to see.

125
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,000
Right here. I was just polishing it.

126
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,640
A late 16th-century blade

127
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,440
that I believe was owned
by Musashi Miyamoto.

128
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,560
Please, Professor Sakai.

129
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Fingerprints!

130
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,800
Uhh! Uh!

131
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
Uh!

132
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Huh?

133
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,920
Unh!

134
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,800
(Neck cracks)

135
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Sorry 'bout the turbulence, guys.

136
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,400
It seems like there's a storm building
to the east. Wasn't in the forecast.

137
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,040
Should be settin' down at the Bureau
in about 20 minutes.

138
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,040
Hey, kiddo. How you doin'?

139
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,440
Great, for a walking napalm strike.

140
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,960
You saved our lives, Liz.

141
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
I practically torched you.

142
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,840
Not to mention a couple of dozen Mayans.

143
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,400
- Sorry about the burns.
- Barely a sunburn.

144
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Come on, they were mummies.
And they were trying to kill ya.

145
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,560
Trust me, there's no upside
to cutting the undead any slack.

146
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,160
You did what you had to do.

147
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,560
I lost control is what I did.

148
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,840
If you hadn't stopped me,
I would have melted the place,

149
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,600
and probably the two of you.

150
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,680
I can handle the little stuff fine,

151
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,000
but when I try anything big...

152
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,040
God, the Bureau should lock me up!

153
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm the real monster.

154
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,520
Hm. (Chuckles)

155
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,440
(Both laugh)

156
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,400
OK, OK. I get it.

157
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,480
No, no. You're the monster, all right.

158
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,920
Me and Abe, we...

159
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,160
I mean, you're lucky
we let you be seen with us.

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,480
It's true. You do cramp our style.

161
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,120
The world needs what we can do.

162
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,000
That makes us good guys.

163
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,800
That's enough for me.

164
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,000
Katie, good to see ya!

165
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
I'd hug ya, but, hey,

166
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,080
bat-god saliva. It's the pits.

167
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,560
Thanks for your restraint.

168
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
I thought you were in Prague.

169
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,360
All finished. We discovered
the wolf apparitions were actually

170
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,960
the hounds of King Vold,
the flying huntsman!

171
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,360
And they weren't wolves at all, but the
transformed ghosts of berserker Vikings!

172
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,640
There's nothing in the literature
that hints at it.

173
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,280
I can't wait to start my paper on it.

174
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,560
Sounds wonderful, Kate.

175
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Can't wait to read it.

176
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,360
Sorry.

177
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,680
- You OK?
- Sure.

178
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,080
Had to flambé a dozen mummies,
but you know the walking dead,

179
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,960
can't say no to a party.

180
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,960
- We'll talk when we get back.
- Back?

181
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,640
Another mission. Seems a folklore expert
turned agent is considered indispensable.

182
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,360
Well, stay safe.

183
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,760
That's too bad.

184
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,640
Me? I'm headed for a two-hour shower
and a sauna.

185
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,240
- Take care of yourself.
- Sorry, Red. Orders.

186
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,840
- You're with me.
- (Groans)

187
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,080
Come on.
We're going to Japan.

188
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,200
Tuesday, 11:30am,
Japanese standard time,

189
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,800
Special Agent Russell Thorne, BPRD.

190
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Predictions, impressions,
and psychic resonances.

191
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,760
Yes, yes. Something is...

192
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,720
Beware the umbrella!
It seems friendly, but really isn't!

193
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,400
And I sense there was
a sudden release of energy here,

194
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,280
yes, very powerful.

195
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,280
You're good.

196
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,600
I've worked with psychics before,
but you're really something.

197
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,440
And I thought it was just bad feng shui.

198
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,480
- I hate psychics.
- I know, I know.

199
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,000
But we have to use them.
Come on, sometimes they help.

200
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,120
Yeah, but it's always too little, too damn late.

201
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,800
Excuse me, Agent Corrigan.

202
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,560
This disc from my security cameras
will be a much better witness than I.

203
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,000
That's Sakai-san, all right.

204
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,160
- You know that guy?
- Yes.

205
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,120
Professor Mitsuyasu Sakai.

206
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,920
I met him at the lpswich Conference
when I delivered a paper.

207
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,360
"Global Interpretations
of Troll Legends."

208
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,680
Gosh, Kate.

209
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
I feel just terrible luring you away

210
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,280
from your exciting career of
combing through rotting manuscripts.

211
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,360
I mean, you used to research trolls.

212
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
That's OK.

213
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,560
Now I get to work with one.

214
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,080
Hm. The past two days, he's had
a teaching assistant handle his classes.

215
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,520
- (lnhales sharply)
- What?

216
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,800
Here. Let me freeze it.

217
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,880
OK. That's never good.

218
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,200
Take your hands off of me!
Get... Let go of that.

219
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,080
I need that! Let go,
it's mine to use...

220
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,560
Oh, for Pete's sake.

221
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
Russell! What are you doing?

222
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,800
Agent Corrigan,
please instruct this person

223
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,640
to stop smearing his dirty fingers
all over my antique katanas!

224
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,880
It's him, Kate.

225
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,560
His disruptive chi

226
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,960
is ruining a delicate psychic inquiry!

227
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,400
All right, all right.
Both of you, calm down.

228
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,760
I'm sure Mr Hiramatsu
wants to get to the bottom of this, too.

229
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,520
After all, his beautiful
home was damaged,

230
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,080
and he'll need our help
to file an insurance claim.

231
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,360
Oh, I got something!

232
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Um, never mind.

233
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,920
Something I can do for ya?

234
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,040
You there! Watch where you're stepping,

235
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,680
my collection cannot be replaced!

236
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,160
(Kate) I appreciate
your situation, Mr Hiramatsu,

237
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
but Russell is one of our best agents,

238
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,960
and he'll take great care
with your collection.

239
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
Hey, can I get a translator over...

240
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,080
Ah, crap.

241
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Hellboy?

242
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,120
- (Creaking)
- Unh.

243
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,040
You're not a normal fox.

244
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,160
(Woman's voice)
And you are not a normal man.

245
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
Really?

246
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
What gave it away?

247
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,880
Any idea why I'm here?

248
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,040
Do I look like a philosopher?

249
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Nice.

250
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,600
You carry the Sword of Storms.

251
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,680
And it has tasted the blood of demons.

252
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,240
That is all you need to know, for now.

253
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Sure, 'cause that's just
so much to absorb all at once.

254
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,640
Don't cut yourself.

255
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,960
(Distressed whimpering)

256
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,360
My love! My love!

257
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,040
(Sobs)

258
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,480
My love!

259
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,360
Why did you not come?

260
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,200
Excuse me?

261
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,800
You sent me here

262
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,720
while you faced
those terrible demons.

263
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,960
And when the storms ended,

264
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,360
I knew I had been rescued
from my father's pledge.

265
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,360
I made ready to receive you

266
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,080
and I waited.

267
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,720
But you never came.

268
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,240
Once, I thought I heard you...

269
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,640
but I was mistaken.

270
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,960
My father spoke of duty and shame,

271
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,040
and death.

272
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,320
Even then, I thought,

273
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,640
"Any moment, my love will arrive.
And he will save me."

274
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,640
(Blade chinks)

275
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,000
(Weeps)

276
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,160
Why did you not come?

277
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm sorry, but you got the wrong guy.

278
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,600
(Sighs)

279
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,360
You have been placed on a dangerous path.

280
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,000
Protect the sword
and keep moving east

281
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,360
toward the rising sun.

282
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,040
Great. Which way is east?

283
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,480
Hungry people are losing their heads. I...

284
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Excuse me!

285
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,680
I sense something
that starts with an "S."

286
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,880
Maybe a "J."

287
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,520
Look, he disappeared, literally,

288
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,240
practically in front of me.

289
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,360
- I'm worried about that umbrella.
- Shut up, Russell.

290
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,000
Tell me you have him
on the satellite display.

291
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,360
They're still running the scan routines.
Just a moment.

292
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,560
- What the hell is taking so long?
- Agent Sherman,

293
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,920
we're doing everything we can.

294
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Guys, get this crap pile working
before I melt it.

295
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,240
Liz...

296
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,160
I can do the little stuff.

297
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,760
It is working, Agent Sherman.

298
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,760
It's just his tracking beacon
is nowhere on the grid.

299
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,600
(Sighs) So he's not on the planet.

300
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
This has happened before?

301
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,160
There was the Marrakech thing.

302
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,400
Oh, jeez. Do you really think
it's something like that?

303
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,240
- How about Prague?
- Bombay, March 1993.

304
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
Istanbul, '89.

305
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,280
And that Marrakech thing?

306
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,520
Hm?

307
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,360
Oh, Hellboy disappeared
and turned up eight weeks later

308
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,360
near Glacier Bay,
frozen in a block of ice.

309
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,480
Yeah. He wasn't too pleased about that.

310
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,000
You just made the newbie face.

311
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,840
Well, if he gets out of this with nothing
worse than a case of frostbite, I'll be happy.

312
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,960
- Kate, he's not on the planet.
- Great.

313
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Anything new on your professor friend?

314
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,560
Well, his study of the origins
of the supernatural

315
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,640
is highly regarded
in academic circles,

316
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,520
but his research seems to have led him
into some very hazardous territory.

317
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,840
Some of these artefacts
are potentially dangerous,

318
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,840
nothing too serious,
just enough to get him into trouble.

319
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,040
Hold it! I need to see that.

320
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
I'll have to call you back, Abe.

321
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,640
- Ma'am, you'll need these.
- Mm-hm.

322
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
Ma'am...

323
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,200
Why don't you boys take a break?

324
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,760
What is it? Kate!

325
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,680
This is one of the 18 scrolls
of the lost monks.

326
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Tokugawa ordered them burned,

327
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,280
but every so often
you run across one,

328
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
and it's always bad.
It's always a problem.

329
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,720
I knew something
in here carried a charge.

330
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,080
These seem like innocent little fables,
but allegedly,

331
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,520
arcane secrets and rituals
are hidden in the prose.

332
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,120
Here! A samurai imprisoned
two demons in his sword.

333
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
Thunder and Lightning

334
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,320
are destined to bring their brothers,
the dragons, into this world.

335
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,560
According to Mr Hiramatsu, that's the sword
that went missing with Hellboy.

336
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,840
- Here.
- (Makes panicked noises)

337
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,120
(Sighs)

338
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,120
From what I saw
on the security cameras,

339
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,440
we're talking about
demonic possession.

340
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,000
If Professor Sakai
has been possessed,

341
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,400
then he went after that sword
to release the demons.

342
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,280
Is Sakai hosting these things voluntarily?

343
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,880
I mean, are we to consider him
a villain or a victim?

344
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,080
Take your pick.

345
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,240
Either way, he's connected
to Hellboy's disappearance.

346
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,880
And we are going to find him.

347
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,160
(Distant siren)

348
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,720
Hey, old man!
I don't care what your problem is,

349
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,920
stay the hell away from my garbage.

350
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,800
(Wheezes)

351
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,760
Get outta here
before I teach you a lesson.

352
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,320
(Frightened cries)

353
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Damn.

354
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,280
(Screeching)

355
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,360
Figure it out in the morning.

356
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,200
(Yawns)

357
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,600
(Man) Hellboy.

358
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,040
Jeez. What's your problem, pal?
I was sleepin'.

359
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,920
You can't sleep here.
Too dangerous.

360
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,320
- Why?
- Bad things in these woods at night.

361
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,440
You come and stay at my house, OK?

362
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,280
Sure. Why not?

363
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,880
I have other guests tonight.
They will be happy to see you.

364
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,880
Uh, I don't wanna be any trouble.

365
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,960
No trouble.

366
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,440
Big house, lots of room.

367
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,400
(Gentle laughter)

368
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,840
(Chuckling)

369
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,280
(Man) That was great. I loved that.
(Woman) I'd like another.

370
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,320
Someone's here.

371
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,760
He's a big one.

372
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,040
Don't mind her.
It's the sake talking.

373
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,360
(Laughter)

374
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,520
Just travellers, like you.
Good people.

375
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,320
- Mr Lu here tells very funny stories.
- (Man) I love the stories.

376
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,720
Uh, don't let me interrupt.

377
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,800
Maybe you know this one.

378
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,000
A farmer met a ghost woman
and she gave him a golden box.

379
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,360
She said, "You must never open this box."

380
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,600
So this fellow, he took it home
and hid it from his wife.

381
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,560
But one day, she found it and looked inside.

382
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,960
And what do you suppose
was in the box?

383
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,040
It was full of gouged-out human eyes!

384
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,920
(Laughter)

385
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,000
And at the very moment
she saw them,

386
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,360
the farmer dropped dead
in his field! (Chuckles)

387
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,040
And the wife went mad

388
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,120
and lived the rest of her days
like an animal. The end.

389
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,880
(Laughs)

390
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,800
- (Laughs)
- Wow,

391
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,560
that is a funny story.

392
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,440
You know, I just realised I'm awfully tired.

393
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,760
- You guys have fun.
- (Chuckling)

394
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,520
This way.

395
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,600
(Giggles)

396
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,640
Sleep well. Very safe.

397
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,760
Yeah, I bet.

398
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Huh.

399
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,280
Clean as a whistle.

400
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,920
Not a spot of blood anywhere.

401
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,080
Where the hell are your heads?

402
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,280
(Man) He must be asleep by now.

403
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,800
(2nd Man) Yes.
(3rd Man) Good. I am starving.

404
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,760
(Woman) A fine meal they've sent us
for the price of a broken sword.

405
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,440
But it is the Sword of Storms
that holds the brothers of the dragons.

406
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,640
For that, we deserve a feast like him.

407
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,240
(Man shouts)

408
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,560
He's gone, and he's taken our bodies!

409
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,480
What? Our bodies?

410
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,560
He has hidden them.

411
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Find him!

412
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,080
Look around. He can't have gone far.

413
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,040
- Boo.
- Agh!

414
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,000
- Ugh!
- Get him!

415
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,240
You guys were gonna eat me?

416
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,240
Ow!

417
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,720
Jeez.

418
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,240
Make him talk.

419
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,280
What have you done with our bodies?

420
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,520
Talk! We're wasting time.

421
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,320
Tell us!

422
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,560
I've had about enough of this crap. Uh!

423
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,040
- Where are they?
- Guess.

424
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,960
Oh, please!
What have you done with our bodies?

425
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,480
Damn heads.

426
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,520
(Whimpers)

427
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,520
Appreciate the batting practice, but...

428
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,320
the sun's comin' up.

429
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,200
Where did you hide them?

430
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,880
I dropped 'em in the lake.

431
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,880
You guys didn't look too hard.

432
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,240
Where?

433
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,720
Bet that hurts.

434
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,400
(Seethes)

435
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,960
(Liz) Great. Suppose the roof leaks, too.
(Abe) It's all right.

436
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,200
The scanning array and computer
are on a different grid than the lights.

437
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,120
I suppose we can't consider the sudden
appearance of these storms a coincidence?

438
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,840
Maybe if we wish real hard.

439
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,160
Agent Sherman,
we've got something else.

440
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,520
Uh-oh.

441
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,880
Let's hear it.

442
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,960
We're picking up tectonic anomalies.

443
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,440
They're localised earthquakes, very intense,
but not on any known fault lines.

444
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,520
I can't see how they could
be related to the storms,

445
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,240
but I thought I should mention them.

446
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,120
But... I don't think they're connected.

447
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,800
When have we ever been that lucky?

448
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,560
With Hellboy gone,
Kate could be in way over her head.

449
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,760
We have to go to Japan.

450
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,680
Because we're the good guys.

451
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,280
Right.

452
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,160
- Nuh!
- (Screeching)

453
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,160
Ohh, you're just in time.

454
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
I was about to play
one of my own compositions.

455
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,720
- Lucky you.
- (Chuckles)

456
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,440
I am, now that you've fallen into my lap.

457
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
But you look tired.

458
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,040
A pleasant tune
will ease your burdens.

459
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,000
Sit with me and we will enjoy ourselves.

460
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,360
Mm, don't think so.

461
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,600
I got somewhere to go.

462
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,960
Listen to the tone of this koto.

463
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,240
I made the strings from my finest silk.

464
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,280
Is it not beautiful?

465
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,160
OK, then. Huh?

466
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
(Hellboy) Hey!

467
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,320
Urh?!

468
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,600
(Laughs maniacally)

469
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,080
(Laughs maniacally)

470
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,360
Jeez.

471
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,600
(Continues to cackle)

472
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,720
I'm sorry I couldn't share
my music with you.

473
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,880
All the same, a mother
must feed her children.

474
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
Screw you!

475
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,880
(Screeches)

476
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,320
(Screams)

477
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,600
I don't have time for this.

478
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,840
Man!

479
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,400
(Screeches)

480
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,280
(Wheezes)

481
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,000
Air Force 916, suggest you divert
and return to Honolulu.

482
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,760
No can do. Got a couple of heavyweights
that have to get to Tokyo.

483
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,160
Can we go around?

484
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,800
Negative. The storm front
is spreading too fast.

485
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,280
We see it, Honolulu.

486
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,560
Air Force 916 out.

487
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
Holy Mother! Look at the size of that thing!

488
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,560
The radar's picking up
hurricane-force winds.

489
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,160
- Can we climb over it?
- I don't know if we can fly that high.

490
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,560
Strap in. This isn't gonna be smooth.

491
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,840
We definitely need a new travel agent.

492
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm tired of flying economy.

493
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,160
It's not much better in first class.
It's going to be rough.

494
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,080
No surprise there.

495
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,800
Son of a...

496
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,080
Not my element.

497
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,760
(Muffled attempts to communicate)

498
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,760
(Pants)

499
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,760
Thanks... Abe.

500
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,400
Not a problem.

501
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,240
Er, let's move away from the shore.

502
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
Right. Right.

503
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,000
Problem is, there's more shore
than anything else.

504
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,560
(Sighs)

505
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,240
- So...
- (Gasps)

506
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,880
You gonna turn into a monster
and try to eat me?

507
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,960
No, no!

508
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,400
The monster is in that lake.

509
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,760
And you're feedin' it.

510
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,880
He has already eaten many of my family.

511
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,400
But, if I write the names

512
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,760
of those of us left
on these cucumbers,

513
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,920
the kappa takes the vegetables
and leaves us alone

514
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,480
for a year.

515
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,640
He really likes cucumbers.

516
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,120
I could carve one for you.

517
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,560
No, thanks, I...

518
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,760
Uh!

519
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,080
What is your name?
What is your name?

520
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,840
Too late.

521
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,280
(Hellboy) Ooh!

522
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,120
(Hellboy) Yah!

523
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,080
(Man) Spill his water!

524
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,280
Spill his water!

525
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,160
Got it.

526
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,320
Come here, turtle boy.
I'll give you something to chew on.

527
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,080
(Growls)

528
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,360
(Screeches)

529
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,960
(Makes belch-like sound)

530
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,560
That takes care of you.

531
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,840
Ask it a question.

532
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,560
You have beaten it.
It must answer your questions.

533
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,920
Why is the sword important?

534
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,240
It holds the demons.
It is your way home.

535
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,760
How do I get home?

536
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,280
Break the sword and return home.

537
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,400
Break the sword and free the demons.

538
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,320
(Laughs)

539
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,680
(Chokes)

540
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,600
How do I stop the demons?

541
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,920
Hey!

542
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Jerk.

543
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,280
Here.

544
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,680
Keep him away from water.

545
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,200
Ugh.

546
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,480
- Can you believe this?
- At least we're out of the rain.

547
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,080
- I thought you liked rain.
- Not this.

548
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,080
This feels... wrong.

549
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,680
(Thunder)

550
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,760
Underwater... that, um, giving me air thing?

551
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,320
That was... um...

552
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,000
I didn't know you could do that.

553
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,240
I wasn't sure it would work either. But I have
burped excess air before,

554
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,840
- so I thought I might...
- Ugh!

555
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,240
I was breathing your burps?!

556
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,640
Ugh! I mean...

557
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,600
ah, thanks.

558
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,480
Good.

559
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,600
- Good to know.
- You know, it wasn't actually...

560
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,960
- a burp...
- (Bleeping)

561
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,240
- Sapien.
- (Pilot) Good to hear you.

562
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,960
We just picked up your telemetry.
What happened?

563
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,600
The plane was hit by lightning.

564
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,320
We lost the pilots.
Agent Sherman and I are OK.

565
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Rough. It's happening all over.

566
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,360
The storms are off the charts.

567
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,640
All commercial air traffic is grounded.

568
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,400
OK.

569
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,480
There's a US sub
near your coordinates.

570
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,200
We can divert it to pick you up.

571
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,720
Have there been any more
of those earthquake anomalies?

572
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,240
Let me check.

573
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,240
Yeah, one at every storm centre.

574
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,200
Say, there was one right near you.
You feel it?

575
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,360
Saw it. Tell Manning to send agents

576
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,960
to check for weird crap
wherever there's been a quake.

577
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,440
And have them take guns.

578
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,640
Big ones.

579
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,480
Sherman and Sapien out.

580
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,800
Here. What?

581
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,440
In Japanese mythology,

582
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,640
a fox is considered
a mystical creature.

583
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,160
Japan. Hellboy.
Then I guess it's here for us.

584
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,880
Come here.

585
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,280
Come here!
Come here... foxy.

586
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,000
Great. I guess we follow.

587
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,120
Why doesn't it look wet?

588
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,880
Yeah, yeah, we're coming.

589
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,600
It's a cave.

590
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,120
At least it's dry.

591
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,440
Yeah. One mummy and I'm outta here.

592
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,360
Could you give us some light?

593
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,040
- Thank you.
- That's not me.

594
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,600
Oh. Then never mind.

595
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,080
- See the fox?
- Someone else.

596
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,120
Come closer.

597
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,680
Do not worry about your friend.

598
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,480
He walks a path of fate's choosing.

599
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,160
Much depends on his success.

600
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,800
Our friend?

601
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,280
The red one.

602
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,000
OK, didn't want to assume.

603
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,440
Two demons, sons of the storm,

604
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,360
seek entrance to this world.

605
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,520
They are Thunder and Lightning.

606
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,760
Their spirits are already here.

607
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,240
These storms.

608
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,600
But the storms are nothing.

609
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,600
Once they walk the earth,

610
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,960
the demons will wake their brothers,

611
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,720
the dragons.

612
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,560
And when they wake,

613
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,320
- the time of man will be at its end.
- (Baby cries)

614
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,800
They are already stirring.

615
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,880
(Gasps) The baby!

616
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,160
(Baby screams)

617
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,600
(Continues screaming)

618
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,160
(Man) Please be careful!

619
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,800
The steps are slippery!
Do not rush!

620
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,080
Head for the bus.

621
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,160
I am sure the rain will pass soon.

622
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,040
Or maybe we head back to town.

623
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,440
(Prolonged sinister female whisper)
Hello.

624
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,400
(Playful) Hello.

625
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,160
(Giggling)

626
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,560
(Laughing)

627
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,200
- Good morning, swordsman.
- We have something to tell you.

628
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,720
(Both laugh)

629
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,240
Please, come closer...

630
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,800
it is a private matter.

631
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,600
That sword does not belong to you.
(Giggles)

632
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,760
Why don't you give it to us?

633
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,280
I don't know. I like it.

634
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,840
It's a great souvenir.

635
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,160
Come, now.

636
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,960
There are other ways
of remembering a journey.

637
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,080
Perhaps a memorable evening
with charming company.

638
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,480
No, thanks. I got places to be.

639
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,000
- Ohh... Don't go!
- Don't go!

640
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,680
If you break the sword,
you'll return to your friends.

641
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,680
What?

642
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,760
Try it and see.

643
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,120
Break the sword.

644
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,320
Go ahead. Break the sword.

645
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,240
Then we can have some fun.

646
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,840
(All giggle)

647
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,000
I said, no thanks!

648
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,600
(All) Ohhh!

649
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,600
Uhh.

650
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,440
Oh, crap.

651
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,400
They've cleared everybody within an 8-block
radius, but there's no stopping that thing.

652
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,120
And they're not having any luck
in Guatemala, either.

653
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,920
(Sighs) Luckily, there's nothing
but jungle around it.

654
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,760
- How did Agent Sherman know?
- You got me.

655
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,640
We can't raise them on the radio
and we lost their signal a half-hour ago.

656
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,080
Your friend wanders through lands

657
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,560
where you cannot walk.

658
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,360
You have your own challenges to face.

659
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,200
The dragon you have seen
is not fully awakened.

660
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,440
You must not let him
join his demon brothers.

661
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,600
(Sighs)

662
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,800
Any hints on how we might do that?

663
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,760
How does Hellboy put up with this crap?

664
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,760
Russell, I'm running out of time
and patience as well.

665
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,160
I don't want to hear
about talking animals

666
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,280
or hungry heads or spiders!

667
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,320
I need you to just sit there,
close your eyes,

668
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,640
and concentrate on finding
Professor Sakai.

669
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,560
Professor Corrigan, please,
I'm not some sort of TV remote

670
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,920
that you can just click off and on.
My powers are...

671
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,520
Where... is... he?

672
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,560
Too close.

673
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,640
What the hell kind of answer is that?

674
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,520
Very close.
Amazingly, unbearably close.

675
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,080
- We should get out of here.
- Not until you find...

676
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,480
Uh!

677
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,120
- (Screams)
- Calm down.

678
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,640
They're called Tsukumogami,
artefact spirits. They're harmless.

679
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,600
Just supernatural fallout
from what the professor's been doing.

680
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,520
Not you.

681
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,440
- Mh...
- It's like being in a cartoon!

682
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,600
Konichiwa! Ogenki-desuka?

683
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,720
Chase these things into the closet
or something.

684
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,760
We have to find the professor.

685
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,760
Mmm!

686
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,000
Uh! Agh!

687
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,280
Ah!

688
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,920
Agh!

689
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,480
(Woman sobbing)

690
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,200
We cannot leave until you come for me.

691
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,320
Why do you stay away?

692
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,480
She will wait for eternity
until the unfinished business is settled.

693
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,840
It's all about the demons. I take care of
them, everybody can go home happy.

694
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,080
Perhaps so.

695
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,080
It won't be long now.

696
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,200
All the actors are here.

697
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,960
The play will begin again.

698
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,520
Take care of the sword.
Only the sword carrier can break it.

699
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,680
Yeah, yeah. Can't break the sword
without freeing the demons.

700
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,840
So, how do I get back?

701
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,120
Big help.

702
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,640
Very big.

703
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,880
Zurich big?

704
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,800
- Or the thing in Cameroon big?
- Big enough.

705
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,680
Damn. Anything we can use?

706
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,240
It likes to eat.

707
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,400
That hardly ever helps.

708
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,720
It's fairly lethargic
except around food.

709
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,360
I really don't wanna see it awake.

710
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,560
Maybe it won't wake up.

711
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,280
Maybe Hellboy will do
what he needs to,

712
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,000
and we can just wait
here for a pick-up.

713
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,920
He... could.

714
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,040
So, any plan? In case I'm wrong.

715
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,720
Not one that doesn't involve fire.

716
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,800
(Sighs)

717
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,520
At least the rain stopped.

718
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,560
Then I just have to lure it up here
so you can go to work.

719
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,480
Oh, sure, take the easy job.

720
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,880
Abe?

721
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,320
No big chances.

722
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,160
Liz! Run!

723
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,400
(Roars)

724
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,960
That's lethargic?

725
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,880
Wow.

726
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,840
(Growls)

727
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,960
Oh, here we go.

728
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,240
(Birds screech)

729
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,000
(Groans)

730
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,840
This is just getting better and better.

731
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,280
(Growls)

732
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,160
Ahh!

733
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,560
(Growl)

734
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,120
(Screeches)

735
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,920
No way it was that easy.

736
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,240
This isn't working.
We should hide in the cave.

737
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,920
No. No hiding.

738
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,920
Anything?

739
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,640
He's gone to the shrine.

740
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,120
The one from the folk tale.

741
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,760
(Low moaning)

742
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,880
Felt that, didn't ya?

743
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,320
(Roars)

744
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,560
- (Roars)
- Crap.

745
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,240
(Roars)

746
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,280
(Cries out)

747
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,000
At least you're solid.

748
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,720
(Roars)

749
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,880
Agh!

750
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,240
(Bellows)

751
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,360
(Grunts)

752
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,000
Serves ya right.

753
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,440
(Low grunt)

754
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,080
(Woman's voice)
Only the sword carrier can break it.

755
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,720
Muhh...

756
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,800
(Kate) Hellboy!

757
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,000
Japan. I can handle that.

758
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,600
You look awful.

759
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,960
I'll live.

760
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,640
Where's the Sword of Storms?

761
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,560
That's not good.

762
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,160
(Bizarre struggling noises)

763
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,640
(Roars)

764
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,480
Free!

765
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,080
(Gasps)

766
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,920
(Laughs)

767
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,360
The land will be dark.

768
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,200
(They cackle)

769
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,520
Do you feel them?

770
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,600
Our brothers are calling.

771
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,360
Then we should wake them

772
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,400
and bring an end
to this puny world of men!

773
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,880
(Hellboy) Think again, dumbass...

774
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,440
cos now... l'm pissed.

775
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,960
(They laugh)

776
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
We only feared one weapon.

777
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,760
And you destroyed it!

778
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,880
Ha!

779
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,840
Stupid, ugly monkey demon.

780
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,720
Me ugly?

781
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,320
(Hellboy) Come and get it!

782
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,080
Aaaghh!

783
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,160
(Roars)

784
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,520
He's starting to look better.

785
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,880
I know you.

786
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,880
Katherine.

787
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,080
The one with the trolls.

788
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,440
Sakai-san, listen.

789
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,920
How have you been?

790
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,040
Listen, you've been possessed.

791
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,480
Excuse me?

792
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,440
(Wild growling)

793
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,520
Big mistake.

794
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,760
(Snorting)

795
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,440
Just go get it.

796
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,120
(Roars)

797
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,080
Don't stay under the tree!

798
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,600
It's common sense.

799
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,240
Ha-ha!

800
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,280
Agh!

801
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,640
Hurts, doesn't it?

802
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,560
Aaaghh!

803
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,920
Eagh! Uh!

804
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,520
(Cackles)

805
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,080
Nnh. Nhh.

806
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,560
(Growls)

807
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,760
(Gasps)

808
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,200
Ah! Uh!

809
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,840
I guess we need a new definition of, uh...

810
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,040
little stuff.

811
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,520
(Screeches)

812
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,840
Agh!

813
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,640
(Cackles)

814
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,040
Aaaghh!

815
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,800
Uhh! Uh!

816
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,800
(Cackles)

817
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,760
(Sighs)

818
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,200
That worked.

819
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,960
I have a feeling Hellboy is back.

820
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,360
There ya go.

821
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,880
What the hell is that?

822
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,040
Oh, I feel so...

823
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,240
(Gasps)

824
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,600
(Woman) The play has begun.

825
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,560
After the samurai imprisoned
those demons in his sword,

826
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,400
he never returned
for the Daimyo's daughter.

827
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,240
He wasn't there to save her.

828
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,800
Unfinished business.

829
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,080
Kate!

830
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,480
Ah!

831
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,840
My love!

832
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,720
Lady, I keep tellin' ya,
you got the wrong... Oh.

833
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,280
Hey, you can stop this now.

834
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,320
Use your head.
You just have to forgive them

835
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,880
or else we'll end up
doing this all over again

836
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,080
and you're never gonna win.

837
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,600
O-Oh. Ow.

838
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,480
I'm gettin' myself some aspirin
and some breakfast.

839
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,480
Who's comin'?
