5
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,375
- Look at it from the bright side Desa Rae.

6
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,345
For the past six months,

7
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:49,849
this has been a long and tedious divorce process.

8
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,418
This settles the deal.

9
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,754
Aside from one real estate deal still pending,

10
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,723
everything else is done.

11
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,960
Just read it and sign by the tabs.

12
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,466
- Thanks for everything.

13
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,735
Let me know when the rest of the paperwork comes.

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,638
Maybe Reggie's attorney will get them to us soon.

15
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,073
- It's over, hon.

16
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,576
Listen, that in and of itself should put

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,011
a smile on your face.

18
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,345
- [Desa Rae] Thanks.

19
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,549
- At least you're getting alimony and,

20
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,250
and, some of that money

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,485
that Reggie's getting from

22
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,387
those properties he was hanging on to.

23
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,589
- That might sound good to you,

24
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,292
but all I ever wanted was a faithful husband.

25
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,494
That was just too much to ask.

26
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,328
Thanks.

27
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,099
(somber music)

28
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,840
- Oh, oh, my God.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,308
Thank you. - You're welcome.

30
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,211
- There you go. - it got it, thanks.

31
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,485
- Give me a second to talk to her, okay?

32
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,652
I'll be there in a minute.

33
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,520
- Okay, baby.

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,588
- Mm-mm. - Mm.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,828
- Hello.

36
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,263
We're not talking to each other anymore?

37
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,531
Is that what's going on?

38
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,100
- If it pertains to Latrel, then yes.

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,902
And what are you calling me for anyway, Reggie?

40
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:16,736
You got what you wanted,

41
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,271
that's pretty obvious.

42
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,607
- We both got what we needed.

43
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,276
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

Geez.

Hello.

105
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,494
Excuse me.

106
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,098
Hi, are you the owner?

107
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,666
- No, I am not,

108
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,901
but what can I help you with?

109
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,770
- No, I'd rather speak to the owner.

110
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,038
- Well, it's gonna be a minute.

111
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,406
But I'll see if he got time to talk.

112

You wanna have a seat right here?

00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,909
I'll go get him.

114
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,777
- Mm-mm, I wouldn't put my purse in that chair

115
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,413
nor my ass, thank you.

116
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,482
- Suit yourself, little mama.

117
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,484
I'll be right back.

118
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,318
- Roc!

119
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,854

- How you doing?

121
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:01,994
Can I help you out?

122
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,563
- Yeah, are you the owner?

123
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,965
- No, but my boy said you was looking for me.

124
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,067
- No, I need to speak to Bud's supervisor

125
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,536
because, look, all I need is a simple oil change

126
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,771
and this wait is ridiculous.

127
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,839
I need to go.

128
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,108
- Petty.

129
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,376
- Petty? Did you just call me petty?

130
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,310
No, I'm gonna tell you what's petty.

131
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,511
This slow service is petty,

132
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,179
our conversation is petty

133
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,547
and this toilet that you seem

134
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,483
to think is a chair is petty.

135
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,650
I know I should've went somewhere else.

136
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,718
Don't worry about it.

137
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,755
- Yes, you being real petty.

138
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,490
But she ain't lying.

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,358
Listen, I been standing here

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,530
and these niggas still ain't done with my car.

142
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,665
- Craig, do me a favor, man.

143
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,501
Can you go ahead and get her situated?

144
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,337
- Yeah, I got you. - Appreciate it.

145
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,607
- And which one's your car?

146
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,276
- Okay, my car is right there.

147
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,246
Listen, I need to get to work by two,

148
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,614
so you need to really be quick.

149
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,249
- First of all, nothing I do is quick.

150
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,584
I'll make sure you get to work on time.

151
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,819
Matter of fact.

152
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,957
Yeah, I'm a need a car.

153
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,261
Nah, yeah, that's cool.

154
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,095
All right.

155
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,365
My boy's gonna be here in five minutes.

156
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,299
- No, no, no, that's okay,

157
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,500
you don't have to do that.

158
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,803
- I insist, all right.

159
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,538
Just go ahead and sit over there.

160
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,642
Matter of fact, let me get your keys from you.

161
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,644

- Oh, I needed these, thank you.

164
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,999
- Yeah, thought you might need those.

165
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,835
- Is this it? - That's it.

166
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,937
- Okay, oh, thank you for everything.

167
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,004

168
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,219

- Aw, yeah, nah, that's the homie, that's cool.

174
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,580
- So how much do I owe you?

175
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,715
- Nah, look, I told you it was gonna be

176
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,416
on the house, right?

177
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,719
Look, there is something I do want from you.

178
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,720
- Oh, what's that?

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,721

180
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,124

181
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,459
- All right, Desa Rae.

182
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,027
So maybe I can get your number,

183
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,161
take you out to dinner?

184
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,062
The movies?

185
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,033
- No, no, I don't think so.

186
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,168
- Hold up.

187
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,169
That's how you gonna treat

188
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,204
a nigga who fixed your shit?

189
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,039
- No, you should never classify

190
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,307
yourself as the N word

191
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,709
and as for me rewarding you for an oil change,

192
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,711
that's not gonna happen.

193
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,014
Besides, how old are you anyway?

194
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,883
- Aw, shit, I'm 29, how old are you?

195
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,119
- My age don't matter, so.

196
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,254
- Hold on, hold on.

197
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,455
I'm trying to figure out

198
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,857
why you ashamed to tell me how old you are.

199
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,258
- Ashamed? - Yeah.

200
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,198
- You old as fuck.

201
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,199
- Give me my ID.

202
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,368
- Let me get out your way.

203
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:33,906
Damn. - My door.

204
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,107
- I hate to see you go,

205
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,742
but you know you fine as hell, right?

206
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,111
- Listen, but you know what?

207
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,346
- What's that?

208
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,381
- There's something you can do for me.

209
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,382
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

210
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,017
- [Roc] What's that?

211
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,419
- I need you to fire Bud.

212
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,254
He's bad for business.

213
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,531
- I hate walking around like a bitter bitch,

214
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,199
but whenever I think about Reggie

215
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,334
and dealing with this divorce

216
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,335
and how he played me,

217
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,903
it just irks my soul.

218
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,904
- You know what?

219
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,505
After 20 years together,

220
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,675
you have every right to be mad.

221
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,611
Okay, he cheated on you.

222
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,280
But it's time for you to move on.

223
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,315
You can't keep on being bitter.

224
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,416
You say it don't bother you,

225
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,118
but clearly it did.

226
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,187
What you can control, though,

227
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,188
is how you handle it.

228
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,656
You gotta go out.

229
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,424
Latrel is in college now.

230
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,793
This is the perfect time for you.

231
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,595
- Girl, please, I am not a partier.

232
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,931
You know I like to stay at home with my peaceful books

233
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,232
and my cuddle bed.

234
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,066
- Boring.

235
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,503
Listen, come out with me tonight

236
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,171
to this birthday party.

237
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,773
And it'll only be for a few hours

238
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,975
and after that I promise you

239
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,612
you can get back to your books and your Tinder

240
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,648
and whatever happened to that guy you were talking to?

241
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,483
- Oh, Marcus, yes.

242
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,817
I still talk to him,

243
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,852
but I don't know.

244
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,120
Something's off with him.

245
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,454
I think he's hiding something.

246
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,790
- You always got an excuse, girl.

247
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,026
Get it together and come out with me tonight.

248
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,828
I promise you you gonna have a good time.

249
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,097
- Okay, fine, just send me the location,

250
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,132
I may surprise you.

251
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,367
- All right, Ms. Bougie.

252
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,535
I'm a send it to you now.

253
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,337
I hope I see you later.

254
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,772
- [Desa Rae] Bye.

255
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,876

256
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,680

269

Girl, you are true life saver.

270
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,603
Thank you for that information.

271
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,004
- [Monica] No problem.

272
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,673
- I gotta meet my friend, I'll see you girl.

273
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,507
- All right, boo.

274
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,341
- Hey.

275
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,909
- Oh, my God.

276
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,078
Listen, I almost fell out this seat.

277
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,214
I can't believe you out that house, Des.

278
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,281
- I told you I was coming.

279
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,483
What was that all about?

280
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,417
- Oh, you know, we used to work together

281
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,685
at the law firm and they got

282
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,019
a lawsuit going on against a company

283
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,454
so I'm just giving her some intel.

284
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,256
Oh, you told me about that.

285
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,257
Girl, I need a lawsuit.

286
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,291
You need to hook me up.

287
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,659
- [Monica] Okay, well.

288
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,762
- But, as for getting me out this bed

289
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,796
in this dry club,

290
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,630
I'm so mad you got me

291
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,165
to come out outta here.

292
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,433
- Well, listen, there's no Prince Charmings in here,

293
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,934
but, you know, you might find you

294
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,003
a little one night stand or something.

295
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,505
- Well, I could use some D right now.

296
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,539
- [Monica] Yes, you can.

297
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,540
- 'Cause especially since things

298
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,608
didn't work out with Marcus.

299
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,876
You know he called me a bitch?

300
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,177
- [Monica] That bitch called you a bitch.

301
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,679
- That bitch, I know, he is a bitch.

302
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,250
But, anyway, I need a drink fast.

303
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,718
- [Monica] Well, all right, I'll get you

304
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,253
a Long Island iced tea and some of these ones

305
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,422
and zeros could look like a 10, you know what I'm saying?

306
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,357
- Yes.

307
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,091
- [Monica] You all right?

308
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:12,925
- Hey.

309
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,859
Oh, hey, yeah.

310
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,162
- [Monica] Get a drink, okay.

311
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,864
- All right, we'll see you in the back, man.

312
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,899
- Hell, yeah. - Yeah.

313
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,801
- Oh, my God.

314
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,068
- [Monica] You all right?

315
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,069
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

316
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,271
Hey, talk to me.

317
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,105
Just pretend like you're talking to me.

318
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,373
- I am talking to you.

319
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,307
- [Desa Rae] I know, but continue talking to me.

320
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,241
- Why you acting so crazy?

321
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,409
What's going on with you, girl?

322
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,478
- Yeah, I didn't think I would see you

323
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,479
in a spot like this.

324
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,514
- I'm sorry, do I know you.

325
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,116
- Oh, here we go.

326
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,350
- Okay.

327
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,285
- I'm Roc.

328
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,553
- How you doing, I'm Monica.

329
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,554
- I'm good.

330
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,555
Look like your friend Des caught

331
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,323
a little amnesia, huh?

332
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,125
Matter of fact, bartender.

333
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,526
- [Bartender] What can I get you, brother?

334
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,727
- Yeah, let me get them two

335
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,662
of whatever they're having tonight.

336
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,830
- Okay, anything you need.

337
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,031
- Just make sure they hooked up.

338
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,532
Matter of fact, I'll take the usual.

339
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,967
Just make sure they hooked up all night, all right.

340
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,068
- [Desa Rae] All right.

341
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,203
Okay, all night.

342
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,004
- I like this already.

343
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,076
- Yeah, let me know if y'all need anything.

344
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,711
- Okay, thank you.

345
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,279
All night.

346
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,814
(Monica laughs)

347
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,015
So, you acting like you having

348
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,250
a dry spell and you been

349
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,618
in the house with that tall, dark-

350
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,853
- I have not.

351
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,354
- Man, hiding him from the world.

352
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,056
- No, let's just enjoy the drinks

353
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,724
like the man said.

354
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,025
- Okay.

355
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,894
Somebody getting some dick tonight.

356
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,629
- Not so fast.

357
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,563
- Okay.

358
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,397
- I'm gonna bust Johnny's ass,

359
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,899
what you talkin' about.

360
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,634
- Bust, nigga, that's kinda gay.

361
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,502
You spot niggas at a table

362
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,637
and you talking about bustin' ass.

363
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,638
That's like, ain't no girls,

364
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,340
he talkin' about bustin' ass.

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,134
- Okay.

545
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,207
(door closes)

546
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,644
Hey, hi, I'm so sorry for misleading you,

547
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,115
but I can't do this.

548
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,383
Listen.

549
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,585
- Listen, you gotta stop overthinking everything.

550
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,786
All right, tryna make sense

551
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,888
of every little move that you make.

552
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,123
All right.

553
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,357
How about you let me take you out.

554
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,426
You know, go to dinner or something like that.

555
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,427
You already know we ain't got nothing

556
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,529
but time on our hands.

557
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,665
- Okay, I'll let you know.

558
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,733
I know where to find you.

559
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,340
- [Monica] I wanna feel it.

560
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,008
Dang, where'd he go?

561
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,655
- Desa Rae Jenkins.

562
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,624
I called you four times today

563
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,826
and you have not answered your phone.

564
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,027
Why are you playing games?

565
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,229
You know we have to finalize this situation

566
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,697
with the rental property.

567
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,398
- I don't have to answer your calls, Reggie.

568
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,767
That's what we got attorneys for.

569
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,069
- You know it's clear

570
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,637
that you tryna be a pain in my ass.

571
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,671
All you have to do is sign

572
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,173
this one piece of paper.

573
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,841
My attorney's gonna be out of town for weeks.

574
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,842
I need this done today.

575
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:44,843
- No, no, no, no, no.

576
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,844
I'm not signing anything

577
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,412
until my attorney has plenty

578
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,381
of time to look over the paperwork.

579
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,682
And I'm sorry that you're upset

580
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,683
that I didn't call you,

581
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,985
but do you remember a time

582
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,286
when you didn't answer my calls

583
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,787
because your little heifer was annoyed?

584
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,256
As I said before,

585
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,690
it it pertains to Latrel

586
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,292
or my alimony check,

587
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,060
which by the way hasn't hit my account.

588
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,495
Where's my money, Reggie?

589
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,031
- Desa Rae, this is complicated, okay.

590
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,865
I am trying.

591
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,100
Lord knows I'm trying.

592
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,736
But I need you to be patient with me, okay?

593
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,170
You already have the house.

594
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,405
My financial situation is not

595
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,607
as secure as it used to be, all right?

596
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,342
Now I need you to sign off

597
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,844
on this one last piece of property

598
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,179
and I promise you gonna get what's due to you.

599
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,714
But I need you to stop being mad

600
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,949
at me for walking out on marriage

601
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,284
that was failing for years.

602
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,386
- No, it failed because you got caught cheating

603
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,054
and you're little heifer is the one

604
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,055
who told me she was pregnant by you.

605
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,323
- Oh.

606
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,993
- You know, give me your little funky paper.

607
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,465
Uh-uh.

608
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,570
Turn around.

609
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,909
Here.

610
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:51,743
Happy?

611
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,945
- Yes, was that so hard.

612
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,314
- Leave me alone.

613
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,655
- Yo, what's up with you, girl?

614
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,890
Give me my bear.

615
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,891
- Your bear?

616
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,925
- Yeah, my bear, you bought it.

617
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,926
- Yeah, I did buy it.

618
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,928
- For me. - It's my bear.

619
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,998
- Exactly.

620
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,134
- Did you tell your mom yet?

621
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,169
- I sent her a message.

622
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,504
I need to call her for real.

623
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,855
(phone rings)

624
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,028
- Hello?

625
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,162
- Hey, Ma, did you get my message?

626
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,264
- No, I haven't checked my messages yet.

627
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,532
- Well, I was just calling

628
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,533
to let you know that I probably won't be able

629
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,302
to come home this weekend

630
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,470
or even next weekend.

631
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,839
- What? Latrel, are you serious?

632
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,840
- Come on now, baby.

633
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,874
I went to the grocery store

634
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,875
and I bought all this stuff

635
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,510
and I have tickets for tonight.

636
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,878
You sure you can't come?

637
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,846
- Yeah, I'm sure, Mom, I'm sorry.

638
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:01,847
I messed up on this test

639
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,515
and I need to retake it.

640
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,117
- Well, your butt is lucky he's letting

641
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,885
you take it over again

642
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,820
so you better do good on it this time.

643
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,757
And I guess I'll just save all this stuff.

644
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,024
- All right, Ma, I love you.

645
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,893
- [Desa Rae] All right, I'll talk to you later.

646
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,727
- See you.

647
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,863
- Why you laughing like that

648
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:18,897
when I'm on the phone with my mom.

649
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,899
- I messed up on a test.

650
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,876
- Man, everything was smooth the other day.

651
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,778
Shit, from what I heard probably was dope as fuck.

652
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:33,779
I just wish we had a chance

653
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,981
to make bigger moves in LA.

654
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,215
You know DJ talkin' about

655
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,683
the feds ready to make some moves,

656
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,085
so look like we gotta lie low

657
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,253
on this here for a minute.

658
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,454
- Yeah, but you can't trust everything

659
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,889
that nigga say.

660
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:44,923
Nah.

661
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,425
Send Gage and Butch down there.

662
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,059
Let them see what's going on.

663
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,494
'Cause I need you to keep

664
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,130
your hands as clean as possible.

665
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,566
Listen, nephew, I ain't never gave a fuck

666
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,068
about them other niggas out there.

667
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,571
But you, you my fam.

668
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,606
So you know I got to have your back, right?

669
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,575
- Yeah, you know I got your back, too, right, Unc.

670
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,910
- For shit loads.

671
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,778
- But you know what?

672
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,448
I think I am gonna send Gage and Romo.

673
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,682
Butch been acting funny.

674
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,550
I don't know what's going on with him,

675
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,018
but I got my eyes on him

676
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,786
just in case some shit go down.

677
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,221
- See, that's what you gotta do.

678
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,391
You got to watch these motherfuckers, Roc.

679
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,293
I know they your boys and everything,

680
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,928
but I don't fuck with none of them.

681
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,896
See, I don't let niggas get too close to me

682
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,531
and you shouldn't either.

683
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,334
Always keep them niggas at a distance.

684
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,403
Don't never let them motherfuckers forget

685
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,305
that without me and you,

686
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,673
they wouldn't be shit.

687
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,807
Never let 'em forget that shit.

688
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,209
- Girl, listen, I told you

689
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,944
that what happened, didn't I?

690
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,612
Didn't I tell you that was gonna happen?

691
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,546
You be playin' too much.

692
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,481
- Bitch, you loud as hell.

693
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,415
Why don't you take that shit

694
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,416
the fuck outta here.

695
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,550
Don't you see us in here talking?

696
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,252
You need to have some respect.

697
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,488
- Wait, who you calling a bitch

698
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,690
and respect you for what?

699
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,191
Who the hell is you?

700
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,594
Yeah, a nobody, girl, you know this motherfucker.

701
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,496
- Who am I? Who am I?

702
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,531
Bitch, I'm glad you asked.

703
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,499
You see I'm the motherfucker

704
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,133
who pays your bills.

705
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,469
As a matter of fact,

706
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,704
I'm the motherfucker responsible

707
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,874
for keeping your son in private school.

708
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,109
Now the real question is,

709
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,011
who the fuck are you besides

710
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,913
some slick talking bucket head bitch

711
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,548
who happened to get pregnant

712
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,816
by my nephew.

713
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,117
- Let me call you back.

714
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,318
Roc!

715
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,920
Are you handling this shit or should I?

716
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,622
- Shit, first of all your ass was being rude.

717
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,824
Being loud as fuck.

718
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:26,892
Man, look, I don't mind fighting

719
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,326
your battles for you,

720
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,161
but this time, yeah, you on your own.

721
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,863
- Well, ain't that a bitch.

722
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,132
Fuck you and fuck you, too.

723
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,568
Come on, Lamar, get your shit together, let's go.

724
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,770
They being disrespectful and I'm a hurt somebody.

725
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,771
- He ain't going nowhere.

726
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,972
I'm a bring him home later on.

727
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,173
- I'm not doing this shit with you.

728
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,408
- See, what I think about that, I told you.

729
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,543
You better pump your motherfuckin' brakes.

730
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,744
- Roc.

731
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,545
- I'm tired of your shit right now.

732
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,679
- Chill out, dawg.

733
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,914
- Get the fuck outta here.

734
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:49,848
- Get the fuck up outta here, man.

735
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,883
You already doing this shit.

736
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,884
- Fuck you.

737
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,885
- What's going on with you?

738
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,120
- I told you about that.

739
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,388
- Man, if you don't get up outta here,

740
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,422
he gonna hurt you.

741
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,423
Man, leave.

742
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,658
We'll talk later.

743
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,992
- Man, look, you need to get rid

744
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,394
of that bitch, I'm telling you.

745
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,462
She's disloyal and disrespectful

746
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,465
and I don't tolerate that shit, Roc.

747
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,202
- Yeah, that makes two of us.

748
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,304
You all right, man?

749
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,439
- You all right. - You good, man.

750
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,775
- Man, you all right, right?

751
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,712
- Yeah, I'm good.

752
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,457
- You just pop up on people.

753
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,427
- Yeah, what you over here doing?

754
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,362
- What are you doing?

755
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,964
- Shit, I came to check up on you.

756
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,165
- Well, I got a lot going on.

757
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,601
I got a leaky faucet and I've gotta clean up

758
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,337
this garage so I don't have time to talk.

759
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,571
- I mean, I ain't no plumber,

760
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,073
but let me help you out with that.

761
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,674
Look, matter of fact,

762
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,277
how about we make a bet? - What?

763
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,145
- If I don't finish in an hour,

764
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,947
you gotta let me take you to dinner.

765
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,184
- [Desa Rae] Okay, well, if I win, I get to choose.

766
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,885
- Come on. - Let's go.

767
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,689
- No, I told you he just showed up.

768
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,391
But I'm so glad he did because Reggie said

769
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,426
he'd fix the faucet and you know how that is

770
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,595
and Latrel canceled.

771
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,230
I don't even know what's gotten into him.

772
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,732
- It's called growing up

773
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,334
and living your best life, girl.

774
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,535
Let it go.

775
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,803
He'll come home when he's ready to.

776
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,373
And as for Reggie's sorry ass, whatever.

777
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,342
It's probably better that he wasn't even there.

778
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,712
I can only imagine what Roc is looking like right now.

779
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,015
- Oh, my God, he's so beautiful.

780
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,082
He got all these tattoos

781
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,818
on his chest and his back.

782
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,187
But, girl, I definitely know why they call him the Roc.

783
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,522
I felt that the other day.

784
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,790
- [Monica] Send me a picture.

785
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,058
- A picture?

786
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,961
Okay, wait, wait, I gotta sneak it.

787
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,667
- [Monica] Girl, damn, come on,

788
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,668
hurry up and send that picture.

789
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,170
Got me over here like a damn .

790
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,810
(camera clicks)

791
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,580
(phone dings)

792
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,415
- Mm.

793
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,718
Lord have mercy.

794
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,320
I'm about to pass the hell out.

795
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,691
Girl, what are you gonna do with all of this?

796
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,958
Please tell me

797
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,162
and do not continue to waste that man's time.

798
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,897
I know how you operate, girl.

799
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,099
- I will take that as a compliment.

800
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,233
I don't know what I'm gonna do with him.

801
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,401
He's so young.

802
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,370
But, I mean, I don't know.

803
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,871
Maybe we can be friends.

804
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,040
- [Monica] That all depends on what you want from him.

805
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,277
I mean, personally I think you're just wasting his time,

806
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,712
but what I do suggest is you get off

807
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,246
the phone right now and start

808
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,282
to get to know him a little better

809
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,084
and by next week, I need to know

810
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,352
what that sex is like on a scale of 1 to 10.

811
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,621
All right, gotta go, bye.

812
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,724
- Talk to you later, bye.

813
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:51,963
You done?

814
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,502
- Yeah, man, that faucet wore me out.

815
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,336
- I see.

816
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,108
So, I knew this was gonna take longer than an hour.

817
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,276
- I mean, it barely took over an hour,

818
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,378
but I mean, I did lose the bet.

819
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,379
- Yes.

820
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,280
- So I'll do whatever you want.

821
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,281
- Anything?

822
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,484
- Anything. - Okay.

823
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,552
- All right, so after you take a shower,

824
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,688
I can get you some clothes from my son's room

825
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,823
and then we can go out.

826
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,325
- From your son's room?

827
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,027
- Yeah, from my son's room.

828
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,096
- Yeah, no, I got some clothes in the car.

829
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,030
- Oh. - It'll be all right.

830
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,232
- You keep clothes in the car?

831
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,067
- Yeah, better than your son's room.

832
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,401
- Just hurry up.

833
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,710
(bright music)

834
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,418
- This is crazy.

835
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,154
I can't believe you got me

836
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,756
to come to some shit like this, man.

837
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,291
I should have thrown a suit on or something.

838
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,193
Oh, you look fine.

839
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,095
You lost a bet so suck it up.

840
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,463
You enjoy it. I saw it.

841
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,764
- Man, you gotta be like

842
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:00,765
the only black person I know

843
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,133
to come to some shit like this.

844
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,968
- No, my son loves it and I saw you, too.

845
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,203
You like it.

846
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,238
- Man, look, the only way I'm a like this

847
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,174
is if Drake or Hole shows up-

848
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,308
- Drake.

849
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,975
- And you know that's not happening.

850
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,210
- Whatever.

851
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,144
So, maybe next time you could take me

852
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,479
into your world.

853
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,980
- My world? - Yeah.

854
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,918
- You better be careful what you wish for.

855
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,752
- Okay.

856
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,724
Thanks again for going with me to the musical.

857
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,126
I know you didn't wanna go,

858
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,994
especially since your butt fell asleep.

859
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,696
- Man, I did fall asleep, man.

860
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,298
- Yes, you did.

861
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,233
- But you know I used to always go to 'em growing up.

862
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,534
- Yeah?

863
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,736
- Yeah, my grandma, she used to always take me.

864
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,707
Then, but life happens and, shit, here I am.

865
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,708
- Yeah.

866
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,109
Life does happen and if

867
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,813
you ever wanna talk about it, I'm here.

868
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,782
- Shit, what I wanna talk about is up inside.

869
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,417
- Yeah, I bet you do.

870
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,852
- No, I'm tired.

871
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,653
I had a good time, but maybe next time

872
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,021
the plans are on you, okay?

873
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,256
Goodnight, Roc.

874
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,029
Roc, come on now.

875
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,731
Don't do that stuff around here, Roc.

876
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,067
Roc, the police are really active, so be easy.

877
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,971
And don't look at my ass when I walk away.

878
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,473
(door closes)

879
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,113

- Yeah, I love this one.

893
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,344
- The artist really did their thing on this.

894
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,146
Man, imagine something like that in your house.

895
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,916
- I would love this in my house.

896
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,183
But I would actually like

897
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,219
to know the artist's inspiration behind it

898
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,821
and you can see it in her eyes.

899
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,256
And since you come here so much,

900
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,959
I'm sure you know already (laughs).

901
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,161
- Matter of fact, I do.

902
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,162
I did that.

903
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,163
- Oh, you did that.

904
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,164
Oh, with your crayons, okay.

905
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,365
- For real. - Whatever.

906
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,501
- Nah, inspiration came Maha Rue.

907
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,735
She got a lousy ass husband

908
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,104
and like five kids or something like that.

909
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,105
I mean, you could tell she's stressed.

910
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,340
Just look at her face.

911
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,908
- Yeah, she does look constipated.

912
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,476
- Right.

913
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,079
- But, if you could really draw something

914
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,481
like this, I would love for you to draw me something.

915
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,083
- Come on, you know I got you.

916
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,551
- Good.

917
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,919
- But for real, though.

918
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,154
I just brought you here

919
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:36,955
'cause I thought you might like coming

920
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,922
to a spot like this.

921
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,824
- Oh, I like it, this is me.

922
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:40,825
- Right up your alley, right?

923
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,460
- Yeah.

924
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,096
But, you don't have to try to impress me

925
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,699
when I'm already impressed.

926
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,802
- Man, quit playing, come on.

927
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,070
Let's get outta here.

928
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,104
I'm gonna take you somewhere else.

929
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,472
- Oh, day part two.

930
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,907
- Day part two.

931
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,010
♪ I miss you more than you can know ♪

932
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,411
♪ And I'm still learning

933
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,147
♪ Learning to do this on my own ♪

934
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:03,982
Cheers.

935
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,552
How you like this spot?

936
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,686
- I love it.

937
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,589
Okay, this is more like it.

938
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,157
You score one point with me.

939
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,158
- One point?

940
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,360
- Yeah, one point.

941
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,160
- After everything I did for you.

942
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,296
- What'd you do for me?

943
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,897
- Hold up.

944
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,799
First of all, I fix that busted ass car

945
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,167
that you have, all right,

946
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,104
and that little leaky faucet.

947
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,939
What, then we went over to the art gallery

948
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,640
and now, look, we having some

949
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,975
of the best food in the city.

950
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,611
- Okay, two, maybe three,

951
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,879
but it'll take you a while

952
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,180
before you catch up with me.

953
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,283
- I can't even give you nothing yet.

954
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,351
- Thank you.

955
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,552
- Thank you, Jackson.

956
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,920
- I didn't do nothing.

957
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,755
- No.

958
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,492
- I gave you a kiss.

959
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,494
I made you smile.

960
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,429
I took your mind off things.

961
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,065
I even gave you my shoulder and, plus,

962
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,266
I'm about to give you some

963
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,702
of this chocolate cake.

964
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,904
Let me see your mouth.

965
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,140
I bet there's a lot that you can do with your mouth.

966
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,574
- Yeah, show me some mouth.

967
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,244
- Okay, but you got cavities bad, I see it.

968
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,245
- [Roc] I ain't got no cavities.

969
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,746
- I see them.

970
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,015
- I'm a show you what I can do with my mouth, come on.

971
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:15,019
- No, let's go dance, come on, come on, come on.

972
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,395
- Wait, wait.

973
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,364
You still haven't told me where you been all day.

974
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,499
I been texting your phone like crazy.

975
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,802
- Where I been ain't your business, girl, chill out.

976
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,704
- No, mm-mm, no, I'm serious, no.

977
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,773
- What are you doing? - No.

978
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,108
- If you didn't wanna do it,

979
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,243
what the fuck you come here for.

980
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,746
See, that's why I stop fuckin' with your ass.

981
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,514
Always acting like a little kid and shit.

982
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,950
- Since when did you stop fuckin' with me, Roc.

983
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,785
What, two minutes ago?

984
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,221
- Come on now.

985
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,223
I just got a phone call.

986
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:56,060
Maybe it was something urgent, man.

987
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,695
- Fuckin' me is urgent.

988
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,996
But you need to take me somewhere special

989
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,832
and start treating me more like royalty.

990
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,501
- Come on, girl, you are royalty.

991
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,769
- Yeah, okay.

992
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,572
- And fucking you is always urgent.

993
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,406
- Mm.

994
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,744
- Come on.

995
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,591
- Let me do it.

996
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,093
I been waiting weeks for this.

997
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:32,530
Damn.

998
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,636
- You are a life saver, girl.

999
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,837
I've been sitting on this paperwork

1000
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,873
for weeks and Latrel needed it ASAP.

1001
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,308
- Well, you know, you'll be right on time.

1002
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,877
No worries, plus we all know

1003
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,945
you been really busy with Mr.-

1004
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,180
- I only saw him one time this week.

1005
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,948
He's supposed to come out here later today

1006
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,984
for dinner, but I don't really feel like cooking.

1007
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,252
I think I'm gonna order some Chinese.

1008
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,319
- Ooh, Chinese.

1009
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,320
You know I'm always hungry.

1010
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,555
That sounds good.

1011
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,856
- Reggie, what are you doing here?

1012
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,991
- Hey, relax, all right.

1013
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,925
I was gonna knock,

1014
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,926
but since I had my key I decided

1015
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,127
to let myself in.

1016
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,163
Just came by to drop off your check.

1017
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,598
- Oh, yes. - Ooh, a check.

1018
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:11,402
- God is good, won't he do it all the time.

1019
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,604
- Girl, I'll give you a call tomorrow.

1020
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,805
- Yeah, good luck with that one.

1021
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:15,806
- Right.

1022
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,909
- [Monica] Bye, Reggie.

1023
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,111
- Goodbye, Monica, stay prayerful.

1024
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,446
- Excuse me? What are you doing?

1025
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,648
- Getting something to drink.

1026
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,982
- No, you need to call before you come,

1027
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,484
knock when you get here

1028
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,152
and you can't just go in my refrigerator getting

1029
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,153
whatever you want.

1030
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,888
- You are always complaining.

1031
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,156
Can we ever just get together

1032
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:32,857
without you griping about this or that.

1033
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,091
- Oh, uh-uh.

1034
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,526
(doorbell rings) Hold that thought.

1035
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,696
Let me get that. It's probably Monica.

1036
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,769
Oh my God, you're early, really early,

1037
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,437
I said eight, not six.

1038
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,139
- Nah, you said six.

1039
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,974
I mean, I'm a little late, but,

1040
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,209
who's car is that?

1041
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,643
- Um, that's my ex-husband's car.

1042
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,245
He shouldn't be long,

1043
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,648
but you think you can come back at eight?

1044
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,358
- You must be one of Latrel's friend.

1045
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,393
- Oh, yeah, this is one of Latrel's friends.

1046
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,562
He just stopped by to see if Latrel was here.

1047
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,532
It's one of his workout buddies from the gym.

1048
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,567
- Yeah, yeah, I used to work out with him.

1049
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,836
It's nice meeting you.

1050
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,171
- Nice meeting you, too.

1051
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,206
What'd you say your name was again?

1052
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,608
- Roc.

1053
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,809
- Roc. - Yeah.

1054
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,077
- I'll be sure to tell Latrel

1055
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,111
when I see him in a couple of weeks.

1056
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,846
- Definitely. - Right.

1057
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,050
- Thanks for stopping by.

1058
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,399
(engine revs)

1059
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,705
- Well, it's time for me to go, as well.

1060
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,440
But came by to drop off your check

1061
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,443
and let you know that I really do appreciate you whether

1062
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,711
you know it or not.

1063
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:01,912
- Well, thanks for coming by, Reggie.

1064
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,447
- You're welcome.

1065
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,949
- Have a good day.

1066
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,556
(soulful music)

1067
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,694
(doorbell rings)

1068
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,000
God, I'm so glad you came.

1069
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,069
I had no idea my ex was gonna pop over here

1070
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,471
so I mean, biggest apology.

1071
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,407
He just popped up unannounced

1072
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,108
and just came and walked in the refrigerator,

1073
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,711
but I told you hey, nuts.

1074
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,945
You just gonna stare at me?

1075
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,714
You not gonna say anything?

1076
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,249
- Girl, you promised me dinner, right?

1077
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,217
Yo, where's my food at?

1078
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,218
- I got us some Chinese food.

1079
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,287
I ordered food so we could eat.

1080
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,122
- Man, I don't even eat Chinese food.

1081
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,957
Shit, you told me to come here at six, right?

1082
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,926
- No, I told you eight

1083
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,594
and everybody eats Chinese food.

1084
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,930
I had no idea my ex was gonna come by here.

1085
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,400
- [Roc] Right, probably too busy fuckin' that nigga, right?

1086
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,668
- Okay, I don't like your attitude

1087
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,836
so if you came over here just to argue,

1088
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,171
you can just go, rise up, you just go.

1089
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,072
- Mm-mm.

1090
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,074
- Stop, Roc, wait, stop.

1091
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,676
Relax.

1092
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,578
I don't want you to go.

1093
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,083
10 points, not two.

1094
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:17,788
You made me smile when I didn't think I could smile.

1095
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,056
You made me feel the most beautiful

1096
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,258
I've ever felt in my life.

1097
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,361
I don't want you to go tonight.

1098
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,062
I want you to stay.

1099
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,731
- Stay? - Stay.

1100
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,667
- Man, look, stay for what.

1101
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,801
Look, let me tell you something.

and forth shit in this relationship.

1104
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,308
It's either you in or you out.

1105
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,378
- I'm all in, Roc.

1106
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,547

1134
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,777
you got five seconds to put some clothes on

1135
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,779
and tell his punk ass to leave.

1136
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,515
- Reggie, what the fuck are you doing here?

1137
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,516
Put the gun down.

1138
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,817
- And tell his ass to leave.

1139
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:00,751
I knew he wasn't one of Latrel's friends.

1140
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,253
He don't hang with drug dealers.

1141
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,822
- Look, I don't know what y'all got going on outside.

1142
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,823
I'll be back for the dinner

1143
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,158
that you promised me, though.

1144
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,561
- Motherfucker, do you know who you fuckin' with?

1145
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,096
You think I won't shoot you.

1146
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,097
- Guys stop.

1147
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,965
- Hold up, hold up.

1148
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,934
I been standing here for two whole minutes.

1149
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,802
I know you ain't got it in you to shoot that thing.

1150
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,638
- Don't you tell me, fool.

1151
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,939
I assure you when the police arrive

1152
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,140
won't shit happen to me

1153
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,742
for blowing your fucking brains out.

1154
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,343
- Get that shit out my fuckin' face.

1155
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,611
- Stop, no, Roc, just go.

1156
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,180
- Man, where'd you find this lame ass nigga at?

1157
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,415
- Just get outta here, just get outta here.

1158
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,950
Stop, Reggie, Roc, please, please.

1159
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,685
Roc, just go, please.

1160
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,756
- He got one more time.

1161
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,958
I'm about to light some shit up.

1162
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,927
- [Desa Rae] Just go.

1163
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,161
Please just go.

1164
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,635
- Yeah, I'd like to see you try.

1165
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,205
Desa Rae, what the hell is wrong with you messing

1166
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,441
with a young ass nigga like that?

1167
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,509
Hold old is this nigga,

1168
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,144
young enough to be our son?

1169
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,278
How could you be that desperate.

1170
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,713
- Desperate?

1171
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,847
No, the only thing I'm desperate for is getting rid

1172
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:04,915
of your ass.

1173
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,051
Now get the fuck out, Reggie.

1174
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,286
And where's my goddamn key?

1175
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,895
And get your fucking gun.

1176
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:23,867
Fuck.

1177
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,974
- Man, you should have killed that nigga.

1178
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,575
I'm surprised you didn't,

1179
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,578
'cause if it was me, I woulda shot that bitch, too, dawg.

1180
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,080
- Yeah, Des cool, man,

1181
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,948
but her husband ain't shit, though.

1182
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,350
- Obviously. - Yeah.

1183
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,351
- Matter of fact, I'm a need y'all

1184
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,418
to get some information on him.

1185
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,320
Yeah, him and his son.

1186
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,189
- For sure, bro, we got you.

1187
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,790
- All right, what's up with that trip to Cali, though?

1188
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,993
Oh, boy was lying or what?

1189
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,062
- Nah, man, it's definitely some heat coming.

1190
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,330
I've even seen some fast like around two

1191
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,966
of the spots that Uncle Ronnie connects be at.

1192
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,535
Somebody snitchin' for sho for sho.

00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,637
Man, we just been low key

00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,240
Plus, we got police on payroll.

1197
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,709
That shit shouldn't be happening, man.

1198
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,645
- Nah, not really.

1199
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,780
I mean, we got some of 'em,

1200
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,615
but not all of 'em.

1201
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,250
- Look, Roc, maybe we should just chill

1202
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,718
for right now, you know.

1203
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,820
Like shut the shop down for a little bit.

1204
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,089
Just until all this shit blow over.

1205
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,225
Maybe. We'll see what's up.

1206
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,159
I'll take to my uncle,

1207
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,460

00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,828
I'll keep y'all posted.

1209
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,264
'Cause if the feds that close to the connect,

1210
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,265
it's just a matter of time

1211
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,833
before they making a move.

1212
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,101
- Shit, maybe for all of us.

1213
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,369
Ain't no telling when or where

1214
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,539
these motherfuckers start showing up at.

1215
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:39,877
- Can I talk to you in private

1216
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,612

1217
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:44,515

00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,350
I'll let y'all know what I'm talking about.

1219
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,786
- All right, stay there, man.

1220
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,488
- What's up with that shit?

1221
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,257
- See, this exactly why I ain't got no baby mama.

1222
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,626
- [Roc] What's going on?

1223
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,794
- You tell me.

1224
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,596
I mean, you got this whole vibe

1225
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:03,434
like something bothering you, like what's good?

1226
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,536
- Man, look.

1227
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,807
I just feel like something big's about to change.

1228
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,408
And I just can't tell if it's good or bad.

1229
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,409
- Okay.

1230
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,211
Something as far as what?

1231
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,781
You afraid something's gonna happen to you?

1232
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,384
You referring to us.

1233
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:27,791
I'm asking you this because you don't touch me no more

1234
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:28,992
and when we have sex,

1235
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,227
you just bust your nut and call it a day.

1236
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,363
It never used to be like that, Roc.

1237
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,532
Talk to me, please, like.

1238
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,834
Is there somebody else?

1239
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,235
- Man, come on, there's always somebody else.

1240
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,471
Man, you know that.

1241
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,805
Look, you told me as long as I take care of you

1242
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,207
and little Roc, that's the only thing

1243
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,775
that matter, right?

1244
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,044
I mean, those are your words, not mine, right?

1245
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,613
- I know what I said.

1246
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,317
But that's when I felt like I had your heart

1247
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,819
and I don't have it no more, do I?

1248
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,222
- Look, they only person I love is

1249
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,024
that little boy running around here, all right?

1250
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,059
I mean, I appreciate you

1251
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,260
for bringing him into this world,

1252
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,497
but listen, don't start complaining now.

1253
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:12,069
All right, you got everything you need around here.

1254
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,604
- I'm still your baby moms.

1255
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,039
It don't matter who you with.

1256
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,815

00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,993
- What you say?

1435
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,761
You know I got it, dawg.

1436
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,530
There ain't nothin' to this nigga.

1437
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,964
- Hell, yeah.

1438
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,133
Hey, look, you know I appreciate

1439
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,168
y'all motherfuckers, right?

1440
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,569
- Man, you already know, dawg.

1441
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,637
- Oh, here we go.

1442
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,437
- Dang.

1443
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:02,846
- Hey. - I noticed.

1444
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,882
- Matter of fact, hold this real quick.

1445
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:06,850
I'll be back, dawg.

1446
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,851
- Where the fuck is you going?

1447
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,085
- I see somebody.

1448
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,086
- Man.

1449
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:10,921
- Hey.

1450
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,991
- You look good, damn.

1451
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,693
What took you so long, man?

1452
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,461
My boy said you took a couple hours

1453
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,462
to get ready?

1454
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:20,463
- Nah, it was an hour.

1455
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,464
His driving was tragic.

1456
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,133
- Man, guard that body, though.

1457
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,101
They about to pick.

1458
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,504
Hey, everybody, I wanna introduce you to something.

1459
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:28,505
This is Des.

1460
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,706
Say what's up, man.

1461
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,908
- Hi. - What's up, Des.

1462
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,210
- She belong to me

1463
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,678
so don't be trying nothing.

1464
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:35,579
Yeah, yeah.

1465
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,815
- I'm glad you said something.

1466
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,417
- Hell yeah.

1467
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,085
- Hey, um, you okay?

1468
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,422
- Yeah, everything's good.

1469
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,690
Why, what's up, what's going on?

1470
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,392
- I don't know, you seem a little weird tonight.

1471
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,660
- No, I'm straight.

1472
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,662
I smoked some weed, but, why, what's up?

1473
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,965
- So you told them that you own me?

1474
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,666
I don't belong to anybody, Roc.

1475
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,735
- That shit ain't had nothing

1476
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,904
to do with no ownership, all right.

1477
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,339
You already know I smoke weed,

1478
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,907
so I don't know what the big deal is, man.

1479
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,175
Can we just go over here

1480
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,409
and try to have a good time.

1481
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,577
- I don't have to try to have a good time.

1482
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,246
I'm gonna have a good time.

1483
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,847
Show me to my seat.

1484
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:12,749
Excuse me.

1485
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:14,651
- My dawg.

1486
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,056
- Hey, so you know I forgot

1487
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,157
to tell you about Archie, right?

1488
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,325
- Archie?

1489
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:25,462
- This nigga, talkin' man, hit him up

1490
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,796
in two weeks or something like that.

1491
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:27,797
Two weeks.

1492
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,032
- Two weeks go by

1493
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,533
this motherfucker stop answering the phone.

1494
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,969
- It's always something with this.

1495
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,437
Come to find out this nigga dog died

1496
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,506
and he had to plan a funeral for it.

1497
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:37,874
I told you, bruh.

1498
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,376
- I feel you, dawg.

1499
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,177
- Motherfucker, man, I told you stop fuckin' with it, man.

1500
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,413
He tried to run that same bullshit on me.

1501
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,148
Talkin' about he had to plan a dog funeral.

1502
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,383
Man, if you don't dig a hole

1503
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,284
in your backyard and put that dog in there

1504
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,285
and come on.

1505
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,254
- I wish that nigga would say that shit to me, dawg.

1506
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:52,489
I'll busy his bitch ass

1507
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,457
right next to him.

1508
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:58,762
- That's the shit that I was talking about.

1509
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,696
- Hell, yeah.

1510
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,731
What, you don't want any?

1511
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,467
- I'm a go to the bathroom.

1512
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,802
- You want me to get you something to drink?

1513
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,237
Or something to eat.

1514
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,306
Whatever you need, just let me know.

1515
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,141
- No, thanks, all right, I'll be back.

1516
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,142
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1517
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,043
Excuse me.

1518
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,779
(men chattering)

1519
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,387
(toilet flushes)

1520
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,525
Desa Rae, what are you doing here?

1521
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:50,146
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to stare,

1522
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,882
but that is a real beautiful dress you have on.

1523
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,351
- Oh, thank you.

1524
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,719
- [Woman] You mind sharing where you got it from?

1525
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,454
- Oh, a friend of mine bought this for me

1526
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,155
but I'm not sure where they got it.

1527
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,223
- I like your dress, too.

1528
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,391
- Oh, thank you.

1529
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,860
A friend of mine purchased mine's also.

1530
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,095
Let me go back over there.

1531
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,229
You have a good night, though.

1532
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,130
- You, too.

1533
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,587
- Roc, you got this bitch

1534
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:31,521
in the bathroom got the same shit I got on.

1535
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,623
Are you fuckin' kidding me.

1536
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,158
You are fuckin' playin' with me, bitch.

1537
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,394
I'm a fuck you and that bitch up.

1538
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,162
You got me fucked up.

1539
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,266
- What was that all about?

1540
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,101
- Just some chump chick looking for attention, man.

1541
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,770
Shit, what took your ass so long?

1542
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,771
- In the bathroom?

1543
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,573
I don't think you want details.

1544
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,408
- Come on.

1545
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,246
Come over here, man. - What's up, baby boy.

1546
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,781
- Everything good.

1547
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,249
- Sorry, I'm late, man,

1548
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,585
but one of my companions had me held up a little bit.

1549
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,586
- It's all good, man.

1550
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,255
Hey, look, I need to get at you

1551
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,689
about something important later on.

1552
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,258
- Oh, that's good.

1553
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,259
- This is Des.

1554
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,327
Des, this is Uncle Ronnie.

1555
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:12,962
- It's so nice to meet you.

1556
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,698
He's told me so much about you.

1557
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,802
- Well, goddamn, you did good nephew.

1558
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,237
- Oh, man.

1559
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,305
- You did damn good.

1560
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,139
Shit.

1561
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:28,111
I guess my only question for you is please tell me

1562
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,280
you got a sister, cousin, auntie,

1563
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,482
or something at home for me, huh?

1564
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:33,716
- No, it's just me

1565
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,118
and Roc has already made claims on me.

1566
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,519
- You damn straight about that.

1567
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,021
- I see, carry on.

1568
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,024
- So what's up, you tryna go dance or something?

1569
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:42,926
- No, I don't feel like dancing right now, maybe later.

1570
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,227
- Man, come on.

1571
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,261
Look, if you ain't tryna do it,

1572
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,262
I know somebody would.

1573
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,664
- Oh, okay.

1574
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:48,932
Well, I suggest you do that

1575
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,668
'cause I don't feel like dancing right now, Roc.

1576
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:52,502
- Mm.

1577
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,672
- Nephew, I'm a need you

1578
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,074
to get your bitches in check, man.

1579
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,276
Why do you let this chick go on like this, man.

1580
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:03,246
I thought I taught you better than that, man?

1581
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,080
Damn.

1582
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,816
- [Desa Rae] Bitches.

- Hey, look, I apologize for what he said.

1584
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,154
But, you need to watch your slick ass mouth man.

1585
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:15,658
All I was trying to do was go dance, all right.

00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,045
just celebrate my birthday

1612
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,246
with you up in there.

1613
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,848
But you over here acting all uptight and shit

1614
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,917
like you way too good for everybody.

1615
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,018
Man, look, hold up.

1616
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,352
Most of them motherfuckers in there

1617
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,620
would die for me, all right.

1618
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,622
- I don't care, Roc, I don't have any issue

1619
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:20,690
with anybody in there.

1620
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,158
Except for your Uncle Ronnie.

1621
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,526
He was wrong and so were you.

1622
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:24,727
Just leave me alone.

1623
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,929
Go back in the party

1624
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,931
and find a little heifer to slap in her face.

1625
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,799
(guns firing)

1626
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,901
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1627
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,606
Hey, drive this bitch, nigga, shit.

1628
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:38,708
Baby, you hurt?

1629
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,377
(horn blows)

1630
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,047
(Des Rae cries)

1631
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,649
Hey, pull up the fuckin' camera, man,

1632
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,985
and find out who them niggas was.

1633
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:52,021
Yeah, tell Uncle Ronnie to call me back.

1634
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,656
All right.

1635
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,158
Shit.

1636
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:55,992
Baby.

1637
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,165
(siren blaring)

1638
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:04,233
- So, look, Roc just made the call, all right.

1639
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,235
He said he need these niggas up outta here today.

1640
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,670
So we gotta catch 'em while they slippin'.

1641
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,705
Is you ready or nah?

1642
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:09,872
- Shit, you want me to kill

1643
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,107
these niggas in broad daylight.

1644
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,041
- Nigga, you actin' like a real bitch.

1645
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,543
Look, you said you wanna be down

1646
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,777

1647
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,646
So this what the fuck you gotta do, nigga.

1648
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,047
- All right, bet.

1649
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,218
(dramatic music)

1650
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,397
There the nigga go right there.

1651
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,969
(guns fire)

1652
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,544
- [Desa Rae] I know.

1653
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,179
- [Monica] This food is so good.

1654
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,147
Good choice.

1655
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,316
So, listen, I'm a be quiet.

1656
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,584
I'm a let you tell the story

1657
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,152
and I'll tell you what I think at the end.

1658
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,855
- Okay, all right, so we're at the club

1659
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,823
and I'm chillin', but it's like Roc is

1660
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,925
a completely different person.

1661
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,193
He's all cursing and yelling

1662
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,329
and he's like nigga this and nigga that.

1663
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,330
And he's high as hell.

1664
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,765
- [Monica] No.

1665
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,267
- And then I meet his Uncle Ronnie.

1666
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:12,735
Within the first five minutes,

1667
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,237
he calls me a bitch.

1668
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,705
- What? - Yes.

1669
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:17,407
And then if that wasn't enough,

1670
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:21,110
that whole shoot out thing, I was done.

1671
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,178
I was scared as hell

1672
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,247
and I haven't talked to Roc.

1673
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,716
He called me once, but I didn't answer.

1674
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,985
I mean, what am I supposed to say?

1675
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:29,986
- All right, I'm a tell you what I think

1676
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,454
and I'm a keep it down

1677
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:34,457
'cause I know Latrel is downstairs trying to sleep.

1678
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,659
But you can't be around this.

1679
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,127
This is not you.

1680
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,163
When it comes to somebody like Roc,

1681
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,397
this is his lifestyle.

1682
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,899
This is who he is.

1683
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,268
A lot of time women,

1684
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,903
we think we can change man.

1685
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,939
We think we can come in, fix them up,

1686
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:51,541
that's not workin' like that.

1687
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,210
You don't need to even be in the environment, okay.

1688
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,479
And when it comes to this Uncle Ronnie,

1689
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,380
he called you a bitch?

1690
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,848
- [Desa Rae] Right.

1691
01:01:58,848 --> 01:01:59,816
- [Monica] I'd of slapped the shit outta him.

1692
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:00,750
- You know I should have.

1693
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,752
I wish I did. All the guys like-

1694
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:03,920
- Hey, Auntie.

1695
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,189
- Hi, what's up handsome?

1696
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,657
- What y'all be doing?

1697
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,692
- Listen, you need to come home more often, okay.

1698
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,893
Worry about that

1699
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,095
'cause you know your mom here about

1700
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,396
to have a heart attack worried about you.

1701
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,198
- He act like they don't feed him up at school.

1702
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,466
(Monica laughs)

1703
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,234
- Yeah, I know, but all that basketball

1704
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,203
and studying be taking up most of the time.

1705
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,370
- He's so good.

1706
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,972
- Good.

1707
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,041
- I probably won't be back till my dad's wedding.

1708
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,175
- Wedding?

1709
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,577
- Woop.

1710
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,679
- Oh, he's getting married?

1711
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,547
- My fault, I thought you knew.

1712
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,783
- I'm a just eat my food.

1713
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:35,284
- I'm sorry.

1714
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,385
- No, it's not, I mean, nothing to be sorry about.

1715
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,220
- Girl.

1716
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,924
(doorbell rings)

1717
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,396
- [Roc] You just happened to be

1718
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,798
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

1719
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,266
- You know, say what you want, Roc,

1720
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,601
but what I'm telling you is I don't want

1721
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,668
a mover and shaker.

1722
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,237
I don't want somebody

1723
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,773
that goes around high all the time and hoses people.

1724
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,241
And anybody that has a mentor like

1725
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,409
your Uncle Ronnie can't do nothing for me.

1726
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,612
I think you should just go.

1727
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:05,648
Who are you, Roc?

1728
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:06,749
And what do you want from me?

1729
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,518
Are you some kind of kingpin?

1730
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,454
- No, man, I need you to save me.

1731
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,990
I need you to save me from all this bullshit.

1732
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,528
- Listen, I swear you have so much potential,

1733
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,363
but I don't know who that was at your birthday party.

1734
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:21,464
Who was that?

1735
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,934
- I mean, tell me what you looking for.

1736
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,970
If it's one of them corporate type of dudes.

1737
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,140
Maybe you just need to go back to your ex, Reggie.

1738
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,744
But you can't, right, 'cause he getting married.

1739
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:35,878
- What do you know about Reggie?

1740
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,313
- That's why your ass be so-

1741
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,081
- Okay, you've been watchin' him or somethin'?

1742
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:39,916
- Damn straight.

1743
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,117
- Okay.

1744
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,051
- I know that's why you trippin' off

1745
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,319
of him all the time, too.

1746
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,253
- You know, I'm not gonna argue with you

1747
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,488
about your bad boy behavior

1748
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,756
and you not gonna make me feel guilty

1749
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,724
about no falling in line like your hos.

1750
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:49,959
I'm done, Roc.

1751
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:50,693
If you don't leave, I'm gonna call the police.

1752
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:51,694
- Wait, what?

1753
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:52,728
- Get out of here.

1754
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:55,264
Go, get out of here, Roc.

1755
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,700
- What the fuck are you doing?

1756
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,702
- I don't wanna do this with you.

1757
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:02,438
(Desa Rae cries)

1758
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:06,375
- Look, I know you different, all right.

1759
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,713
I don't wanna do this shit with you either.

1760
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,415
- Listen, I can't save you.

1761
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,883
I can't even save myself from

1762
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,619
the pain from my failed marriage.

1763
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,657
- So I guess we just fuckin'.

01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:26,863

1765
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:31,400

- What's up, my nigga, you got a minute?

1771
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,686
- Yeah, more than a minute,

1772
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,688
what's going on, man?

1773
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,690
- Well, here's the deal.

01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,159
I just got word that the feds

Which means shit might hit the fan

1777
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,302

1778
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,837
- Come on, man, you know I got your back.

01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,106
You ain't gotta ask me no shit like that.

1780
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,108
- Shit, I don't know, Roc.

1781
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,410
You been kind of distant lately.

1782
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,312
Kind of hard to get a hold of.

1783
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,414
- Man, this is about Des?

1784
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:20,583
Come on, bro, I ain't talked to her

1785
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,985
in a couple of weeks.

1786
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:25,588
But maybe my lifestyle's just too much for her.

1787
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,624
- Good, celebrate and let that bitch walk.

1788
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,126
Listen, nephew.

1789
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:34,630
What you need to do is get you a fine young bad bitch,

1790
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,899
one that knows how to respect a nigga

1791
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,534
and keep her fuckin' mouth shut.

1792
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:41,337
- Yeah, hey, Unc, let me take this right quick.

1793
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,338
- All right.

1794
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,607
I bid you nephew.

1795
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:47,843
- Yeah, hello?

1796
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,581
Yeah, I didn't think your ass was gonna call.

1797
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:53,950
- One question.

1798
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,319
How many hos have you been sleeping with, Roc.

1799
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,055
- Man, why you asking me some dumb ass shit like that.

1800
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,389
- I said how many.

1801
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,625
- Look, that ain't your fuckin' business, man.

1802
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,226
- I swear to God if you gave me something

1803
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,461
you will never hear the end of it.

1804
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,964
It is my business and you better tell me.

1805
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,199
I will sue your ass.

1806
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,434
- You better go check one

1807
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:12,668
of them other niggas you fuckin' with.

1808
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:13,936
'Cause I know I'm good.

1809
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,938
- And trust me when I say you better hope

1810
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,540
to hell you didn't.

1811
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,675
I'll be in touch.

1812
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,345
(hip hop music)

1813
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,417
(phone rings)

1814
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:33,222
- Tracy, put your motherfuckin' mama on the phone now.

1815
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,725
(phone beeps)

1816
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,936
(phone rings)

1817
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:51,941
- [Recording] Please leave your message after the tone.

1818
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,343
- I'm leaving work in about 30 minutes.

1819
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,511
Meet me at the Love Market near the house.

1820
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,380
It's important.

1821
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,748
I can't believe you lied to me about this.

1822
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,016
You need to man up and be prepared

1823
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,717
to answer some questions.

1824
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:03,386
You better be there.

1825
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,189
Oh, hey, Mr. Cummings.

1826
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,524
- Hey, how you doing?

1827
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,292
- I'm leaving work in a little bit,

1828
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,227
but I'll be in early.

1829
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:12,495
Can you check your schedule

1830
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:13,763
just to make sure everything's set?

1831
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,232
- Yes, I will and I'd like to apologize again.

1832
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:19,668
Lay offs happen, you been with us 13 years,

1833
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:20,669
but it's business.

1834
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:21,904
I hate to see you go.

1835
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,572
You still have two weeks here with us.

1836
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:24,573
- I appreciate that

1837
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,275
and I know it's not your fault.

1838
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,977
- Okay, just business.

1839
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:28,811
- Thank you.

1840
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,246
Have a great day.

1841
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,835
- Damn girl, you got a minute?

1842
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:53,869
- Oh, I though I had one,

1843
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,071
but I went to the doctor

1844
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,306
and he gave me something I can't get rid of.

1845
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:58,774
- Can't get rid of, girl, what you talkin' about.

1846
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,010
- Oh, you know what I'm talking about, yes, you do.

1847
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,711
Look at this.

1848
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,613
- Man, don't nobody care about no damn test, man.

1849
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,015
- Roc.

1850
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,616
- You know I stay strapped up,

1851
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:08,851
I don't know what you talkin' about.

1852
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:09,785
- Don't put those in my bag, Roc, no,

1853
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:10,853
it's too late for condoms.

1854
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,556
Look, I need you to stay focused.

1855
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,657
I really tested positive,

1856
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,425
I went to the doctor.

1857
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,595
Look, you're not getting it.

1858
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,564
I need you to buy this.

1859
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,566
I need you to buy this.

1860
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:24,667
I need you to get serious.

1861
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,668
- Girl, what you putting all

1862
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,502
this stuff in this bag for.

1863
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,703
- Yes, listen.

1864
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:28,504
- I ain't buying all this stuff, man.

1865
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:29,705
- Listen, listen.

1866
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,842
- Oh, shit.

1867
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,344
Oh.

1868
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,178
Fuck.

1869
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,181
You pregnant for real?

1870
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,317
Damn, girl.

1871
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,891
You know I got you, right?

1872
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,192
- You promise?

1873
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,494
- I promise, man.

1874
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,996
For real, look, whatever you need.

1875
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:54,830
All right?

1876
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:57,600
Oh, shit.

1877
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,601
How you feeling?

1878
01:08:58,601 --> 01:08:59,835
- I'm scared.

1879
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,004
I mean, we haven't been cool, Roc.

1880
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:05,207
And I didn't even think I could get pregnant.

1881
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,910
- Damn, girl, hey, I'm a buy whatever you need.

1882
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,145
Where's that bag at?

1883
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,647
All this shit up in there, hell, yeah.

1884
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,481
Come on.

1885
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,090
- I know you're worried,

1886
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,459
but I'm happy for you and Roc.

1887
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,127
There's something about him that I like,

1888
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:27,429
even though he definitely got some issues.

1889
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,231
- Yeah, I like him a lot, too,

1890
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,834
but, unfortunately, we're just two broken people trying

1891
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,036
to make it whirl.

1892
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,804
You know, I didn't even think I could get pregnant.

1893
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,806
Can you imagine how surprised I was?

1894
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,808
- Mm-hmm, well, you know what?

1895
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,310
There's nothing you could do now

1896
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,446
but have that beautiful baby for the both of y'all

1897
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,815
and I am so excited, you know.

1898
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,151
I'm a spoil that child so much.

1899
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,452
I already went shopping.

1900
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:51,887
Check it out.

1901
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,789
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.

1902
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:54,823
You know, I'll take it over

1903
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,292
to his penthouse tomorrow.

1904
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,360
Can you believe I've never been to his penthouse?

1905
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,528
I've been kind of reluctant

1906
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,763
about going all in with him.

1907
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,798
- Well, I can't really blame you for that.

1908
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,733
I mean, he's got something more going on

1909
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,101
that we don't even know about,

1910
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,003
so you do have to make sure that you're good.

1911
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,004
- Yeah.

1912
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,406
- I want the father of my baby

1913
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,841
to be all that he can be

1914
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:13,909
and Roc has told me

1915
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,110
about his broken childhood,

1916
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,345
lives in the streets

1917
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:19,415
and he talked about getting his GED.

1918
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:20,849
You should see this playhouse

1919
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,451
he built for the baby.

1920
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:23,652
It looks like a palace.

1921
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:24,653
It's so cute.

1922
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:25,888
He's so good with his hands.

1923
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,323
It has these trellises and-

1924
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,958
- Ooh, girl. - Shut up.

1925
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,628
- You got me up in here about to cry.

1926
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,530
But you know what, some real shit.

1927
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,599
Roc's backstory is really

1928
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:40,236
the story of so many people in our community.

1929
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,905
A lot of these young boys are just lost.

1930
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,740
You know, they don't know how to love.

1931
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,909
They just trying to survive day by day

1932
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,278
and also protect themselves.

1933
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,281
So I'm really hoping this baby changes things for Roc.

1934
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:53,816
Yeah, I hope so, too.

1935
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,652
I just gotta figure out how I'm gonna tell Latrel.

1936
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:58,587
I don't even think he knows I'm dating somebody.

1937
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,724
I'm sure Reggie's nosy butt said something.

1938
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:03,859
- Girl, do Reggie still be popping up on you?

1939
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,294
- No, I haven't seen him since

1940
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,429
the time he busted in on Roc and I.

1941
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:10,099
I guess that prompted him to hurry up and get married.

1942
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,834
- He really went through with it?

1943
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,902
- I don't know and I don't have time to care.

1944
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:18,207
I'm over Reggie and I'm so happy I can finally say that.

1945
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,876
- Girl, I know that's right.

1946
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,877
- No Reggie.

1947
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,015
(doorbell rings)

1948
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,988
Hey. - What's going on.

1949
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:35,391
- You finally made it through, huh?

1950
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,325
- Oh, what?

1951
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,696
Oh, my God, Roc.

1952
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,299
I am shocked.

1953
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,267
I had no idea your place looked like this.

1954
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,036
And this looks nothing like

1955
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,638
the mechanic shop you call your castle.

1956
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,974
- First of all, the shop is my castle.

1957
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,575
All right, and before you say anything,

1958
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,544
you already know, I was about to raw somethin' up.

1959
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:56,545
- Whatever, Roc.

1960
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:57,880
You can have your little weed.

1961
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,249
Anyway, just know that smoking is not good

1962
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,250
for the baby.

1963
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,153
- Man, I ain't never known a baby to come out high.

1964
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,455
I'll make sure I keep my distance, though.

1965
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,257
So, is it a boy or a girl?

1966
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:09,458
- I don't know yet.

1967
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,893
But I don't care.

1968
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,394
As long as the baby looks like you, I'm good.

1969
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,629
- And you already know as long

1970
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,497
as she looks like you, I'm good, too.

1971
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,701
- Well, I have something for you.

1972
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:21,270
First, this one is from Monica.

1973
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,974
There you go, hold it up.

1974
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,576
Hold it so I can read it, yeah.

1975
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,545
My mommy is sweet, that's me,

1976
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,114
but watch out for my dad,

1977
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,816
'cause he gotta watch out for you.

1978
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,284
- Man, y'all be wildin', for real.

1979
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:36,285
Tell her I said thank you.

1980
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,287
- I'll tell her.

1981
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:41,557
All right, now this one is from me.

1982
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:42,491
- Okay.

1983
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,492
- Just trying to help you out.

1984
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,760
- See.

1985
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,795
"The Pleasures of Loving."

1986
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,397
Hold on, you think that Roc Double D Dawson

1987
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,232
needs help with this?

1988
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,066
Come on, man.

1989
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,402
- Did you see the book?

1990
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:54,570
I'm just trying to help.

1991
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,004
I'm just trying to help.

1992
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,306
Well, okay, wait.

1993
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:59,808
So I got this one to make you laugh,

1994
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:02,778
but this is one I really wanna give to you.

1995
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,047
- Man, I could really use this.

1996
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,048
- You like it?

1997
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,149
- Yeah, I do, thank you.

1998
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:07,983
- Good.

1999
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,688
All right, so, I wanna see the rest of the place.

2000
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:13,922
- Come on.

2001
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,859
- You show me where the magic happens.

2002
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,228
- Right up here.

2003
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,062
- This way?

2004
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:20,896
- Yeah.

2005
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,572
I swear, after looking at this book,

2006
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,375
it looks a lot harder than I thought,

2007
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,144
but I'm a definitely put some time aside,

2008
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,012
make sure I study for this thing.

2009
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:38,447
Well, you know, I'm here for you

2010
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,015
if you need to study.

2011
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,016
- Yeah, but.

2012
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,084
- I can help.

2013
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,622
You ever thought about opening a construction business?

2014
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,625
What you did with our daughter's playhouse,

2015
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,626
you got skills.

2016
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:51,627
- Oh, you like that?

2017
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,862
- Yeah, I like it.

2018
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,097
- It's crazy just because

2019
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,665
I've always meant to be an artist, though.

2020
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,133
You know I like to draw.

2021
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:00,002
- There you go again.

2022
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,104
- I'm serious, man.

2023
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,338
- You're serious.

2024
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:04,606
- Yeah, you don't think I could draw?

2025
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,774
- No.

2026
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:06,942
- You know the art gallery that we went to?

2027
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,177
- Yeah.

2028
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:08,844
- You know that's my piece, right?

2029
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,179
- Roc, no.

2030
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,213
No, way.

2031
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,981
I know that you didn't do that.

2032
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,751
Man, look, let me show you something.

2033
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:18,587
(Desa Rae laughs)

2034
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:28,197
- Whoa.

2035
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,500
Oh, my God, are you serious?

2036
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,235
- You like that?

2037
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,237
- Roc, this is stunning.

2038
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,840
Can I keep it?

2039
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,841
- Hell, yeah, man, you know

2040
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,443
you can have whatever you want.

2041
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:47,950
- What I want, I want love, peace and happiness.

2042
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,325
I know that's what you want, too.

2043
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,126
- Yeah, you know I got you, right?

2044
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,228
- You better.

2045
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,133
- [Man On TV] This is my damn money

2046
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,835
and I do exactly what I please.

2047
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,270
- What up, Unc.

2048
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,973
- The shit done finally hit the fan, Roc.

2049
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,208
Them motherfuckers are coming for me.

2050
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,310
And this time I can't do shit about it.

2051
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,179
Now I've already talked to Clint down

2052
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,580
at the station.

2053
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,282
Them motherfuckers want me to turn myself in

2054
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,084
and do the time.

2055
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,652
But look at me.

2056
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:27,556
I'm an old man now and time ain't on my side.

2057
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,292
Fact is, a motherfucker could die

2058
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:33,495
in that motherfucker, man.

2059
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:34,696
- Come on, Unc,

2060
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,231
you know it ain't going down like that.

2061
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,001
Everything you did for these dudes in this community,

2062
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,936
what about the kids at the rec center.

2063
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,838
And Clint's fat ass,

2064
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:46,241
all that money that you put into his pocket,

2065
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:47,476
man, come on, dawg.

2066
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:48,810
What about Congressman Jerry?

2067
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,245
I know there's something he can do.

2068
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:52,581
He can only do so much, Roc.

2069
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,450
Especially since the shit coming from the top.

2070
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,119
The motherfuckers just jealous, man.

2071
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:58,687
I'm making too much money.

2072
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,322
I got too big.

2073
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,723
And they not gonna stop until they get me

2074
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,960
and if not me, the next nigga in charge

2075
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,864
and that will be you.

2076
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:16,939
- Man, look.

2077
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:23,679
Whatever you need, just let me know, all right.

2078
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:28,483
- I need you to take the fall

2079
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:29,718
and do the time.

2080
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:32,487
(dramatic music)

2081
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,061
(Roc knocking)

2082
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:42,431
♪ It feels so right

2083
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,067
♪ And I will take this opportunity ♪

2084
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,635
- You're late, real late.

2085
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:50,339
But I'm so glad you're here, come on.

2086
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,273
I'll do it.

2087
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,944
Listen, I have a surprise for you.

2088
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,279
Let me show you.

2089
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,384
Ta-da, you like it?

2090
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,385
- Aw, man, this is dope.

2091
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:04,886
- Yeah?

2092
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:05,687
- Yeah, but why you throw it up so early, though?

2093
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,622
Thanksgiving ain't what,

2094
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,556
for another couple weeks?

2095
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:08,824
- I know it's early,

2096
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,258
but I'm excited about little Roc coming over

2097
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,693
for Thanksgiving dinner.

2098
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,295
He's still coming, right?

2099
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,063
- Man, I thought he was,

2100
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:16,898
but I don't think Vanessa's having it.

2101
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:17,899
You know I be just trying

2102
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,368
to keep the confusion down.

2103
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:22,704
- All right, I'm sure I'll see him at same point.

2104
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:23,805
- But nah, come over here.

2105
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,607
I just wanna talk to you.

2106
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:26,808
You look tired.

2107
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:27,743
You want me to get you something.

2108
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,611
I can go grab you something.

2109
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:30,912
Nah, I'm straight.

2110
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,715
I just wanna talk to you for a little bit.

2111
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,350
- Okay.

2112
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:36,585
You all right?

2113
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:40,889
- Yeah, um, looks like some things are going on

2114
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,591
with the business.

2115
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,459
And my Uncle Ronnie,

2116
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,528
it looks like he's gonna get caught up with the feds,

2117
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,864
so they ready to make some move.

2118
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,766
- Well, I know you don't wanna hear me say this

2119
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,401
about your uncle, but he deserves everything

2120
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:53,502
he has coming to him.

2121
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,936
That man is evil.

2122
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:56,938
One day you're gonna see he's done more bad

2123
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,306
in your life than good, Roc.

2124
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,675
- I keep trying to tell you,

2125
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,144
if it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't even be here.

2126
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:05,714
- Okay, I get it, there's another side, but-

2127
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:06,948
- Nah, but.

2128
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,116
- Wait, what are you trying to say?

2129
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:09,618
What is it?

2130
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,287
- Looks like I might be going away for a little bit.

2131
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,189
- Going away?

2132
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,190
Going away where, Roc?

2133
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,426
What are you talking about?

2134
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,829
Please don't tell me you're saying what I think

2135
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,264
you're gonna say.

2136
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:26,134
- Man, I don't think my uncle could do 5 to 10 years.

2137
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:27,369
- 10 years?

2138
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,305
10 fucking years, are you kidding me, Roc?

2139
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:33,041
Roc, I'm pregnant with our baby.

2140
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,609
You won't even be here when she's born.

2141
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:38,080
She won't even know who you are, Roc.

2142
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,248
- You saying it's a girl?

2143
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,684
- Yeah, a beautiful baby girl

2144
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:47,122
and her photo and some stupid stuff is

2145
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:49,524
in this stupid box.

2146
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,193
I can't believe I been so stupid.

2147
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,894
No, don't you baby me.

2148
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,830
You need to go with your Uncle Ronnie

2149
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:57,265
because I know he's behind this.

2150
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,500
Get outta here.

2151
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,471
(somber music)

2152
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,947
- Dawg, why the fuck you brought us here, dawg.

2153
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:12,781
- Shit.

2154
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:15,650
- Look, though, what happened though.

2155
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:16,818
So the bill come.

2156
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,720
Motherfucker like almost $400.

2157
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,422
- [Man 2] Four what? Damn.

2158
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,391
- Girl bought about like 10 Long Islands.

2159
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,826
A surf and turf.

2160
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:27,662
Shit, but I ain't trippin', though.

2161
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:28,930
You know I was for the fuck.

2162
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,700
(all chattering)

2163
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,070
So I go for my bread.

2164
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,838
I don't even know where my loaf at.

2165
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:38,640
I had to think like

2166
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,610
I must have left it in my other shooter.

2167
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,446
So I'm like, hey, I'm telling her like

2168
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,682
hey, shawty, just pay the bill.

2169
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:50,352
Talking how you old broke ass nigga.

2170
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:51,586
I knew you y'all didn't,

2171
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:52,988
you a loser.

2172
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:54,489
All right, hey, bitch, I-

2173
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,825
(gun cocks)

2174
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,963
- Hold up, nah, we good.

2175
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,407
- I gotta ask you.

2176
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:15,010
Why does everyone treat you like you're some kingpin?

2177
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,344
What the hell is this?

2178
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:17,279
- Sit down.

2179
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,450
I ain't talked to you all week.

2180
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,486
How you feeling?

2181
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,320
- Awful.

2182
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:28,223
I came here to see if you changed your mind

2183
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:30,425
or if I could help you change it.

2184
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,661
- Well, I don't know if there's anything you could do.

2185
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,864
The trial's already set to start next week.

2186
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:38,834
I'm gonna spend as much time with you as I can.

2187
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,068
- No.

2188
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,137
No, that's only gonna make it worse.

2189
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,572
Look, I don't think you realize

2190
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,173
how hard this is, Roc.

2191
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,642
Our daughter won't even know you.

2192
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:48,643
She deserves to be raised by her father.

2193
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,212
Do you realize by doing this,

2194
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:53,815
you're choosing your Uncle Ronnie over your children.

2195
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,550
- Man, you don't get it.

2196
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,920
Look, my kids are already taken care of, all right.

2197
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,555
Just like you will.

2198
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,890
- And you don't get it, Roc.

2199
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,891
I don't want your money.

2200
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,092
I don't need it.

2201
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:06,261
Roc, I need you, please baby, don't do this.

2202
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:07,395
I'm begging you, Roc.

2203
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:09,831
- Why, 'cause you love me?

2204
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,099
What, do you love me?

2205
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,068
- Stop, I don't know.

2206
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:14,269
I don't know.

2207
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:17,873
I only loved one man and that was my husband.

2208
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,241
I've never even been with another man

2209
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,575
until I met you.

2210
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,815
- Look, if anything changes, I'll let you know.

2211
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:28,750
I can't make any promises.

2212
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:33,588
- Baby, you keep saying that I'm different and I am.

2213
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:36,191
Look at me, Roc, please.

2214
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,893
When you say that you want me to save you,

2215
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:38,894
save you from what?

2216
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,196
- Man, save me from myself.

2217
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:42,030
- Okay.

2218
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,434
Okay, well, so let me do it, please, babe.

2219
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,803
Give us more time, Roc.

2220
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:51,439
I know you want this and I know you need this, please.

2221
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,908
- Look, I know what I need.

2222
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:56,411
I also know what I don't need, all right.

2223
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:59,547
If anything changes, I'll let you know.

2224
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,417
(phone buzzes)

2225
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:05,186
(Desa Rae cries)

2226
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,957
- [Gunman 1] You should kill that bitch ass nigga now, man.

2227
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:09,991
- [Gunman 2] You better not move.

2228
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,761
(dramatic music)

2229
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,508
- All right, what the fuck is this, dawg.

2230
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:29,377
I'm already having a bad ass day.

2231
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:31,913
- Caught this nigga creeping around outside.

2232
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,348
You know you been looking for him

2233
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:35,984
since that incident with your bread.

2234
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,252
- [Gunman 1] Maybe you can ask this nigga

2235
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:39,254
why he feel brave enough to come around here.

2236
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:42,924
- Roc, I swear I didn't take the money.

2237
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,225
I swear I didn't.

2238
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:45,961
Tell these fools we good.

2239
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,495
We good, ain't we?

2240
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:50,065
That's why I'm here so we can talk about this shit.

2241
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,800
Fuck that nigga, man.

2242
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,370
- See that's the problem, though.

2243
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,339
I'm already done talking about this shit.

2244
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,374
- Please don't do nothing you gonna regret.

2245
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,508
I got kids.

2246
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:02,110
My daughter birthday next week.

2247
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,712
I didn't take the money.

2248
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,213
I could take you to the niggas who did

2249
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:07,649
and I could make sure you get all your money back.

2250
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,150
- This nigga lying, Roc.

2251
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,151
I'm telling you.

2252
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,152
- Dumb motherfucker.

2253
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,153
I already got my money back,

2254
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,755
all 100 Gs, plus some.

2255
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,056
- So we good.

2256
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,225
- Yeah, we good.

2257
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,159
Matter of fact.

2258
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,694
(gun cocks)

2259
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:22,831
Nigga, what day is your daughter birthday on?

2260
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,899
- It's on Wednesday.

2261
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:26,167
- And what's her favorite color?

2262
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,369
- Purple.

2263
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,338
- Nigga, who the fuck you yelling at?

2264
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,407
Matter of fact, Craig,

2265
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,076
on Wednesday, won't you go find

2266
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:38,313
a nice little purple teddy bear for this nigga.

2267
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,648
Deadbeat ass nigga.

2268
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:43,718
Shit, my pops died when I was seven, too.

2269
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:47,355
Must be some lucky kind of number or whatever, right?

2270
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,024
- Fall back, nephew.

2271
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,258
Don't waste no bullets on this nigga.

2272
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:53,194
We got bigger fish to try.

2273
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:56,765
Besides, I got a lot of heat on me now,

2274
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,901
so I don't need no messy shit going on, Roc.

2275
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,971
So tuck your toy and let this shit go.

2276
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,308
- Guess, it's your lucky day, right.

2277
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:10,612
- [Victim] Thank you, you not gonna regret this.

2278
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:12,380
- Shit, we all lucky.

2279
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,482
And how many times I gotta tell you niggas

2280
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,384
who's in charge around here.

2281
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,054
Shit like this don't go down unless I say so,

2282
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,656
so squash this shit and let's go.

2283
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:24,492
You two, Craig, with your simple-minded ass.

2284
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:25,527
- Yeah, you might be the one

2285
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:26,961
in charge around here, Unc,

2286
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:31,433
but I'll make the decisions for this motherfucker.

2287
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:33,768
(gun fires)

2288
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,271
All right, clean this shit up.

2289
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,772
- Fuck this nigga.

2290
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:48,516
- I'm just glad I didn't go through with that wedding.

2291
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:53,254
You know, she lied to me about having an abortion?

2292
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:56,991
I'm not not happy with our relationship.

2293
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,693
- When you said you had something to talk about,

2294
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,795
I thought it was about Latrel.

2295
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:03,398
Is this what you came over here to talk to me about?

2296
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:06,801
- I came by to see how things were coming with your job.

2297
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,837
Latrel told me you got laid off.

2298
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:10,271
You doing okay financially?

2299
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,739
- Yes, I'm fine

2300
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:15,610
and when I need some extra money I will get another job.

2301
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,811
In case Latrel told you also,

2302
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:18,680
I'm going up to see him this weekend

2303
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,248
and Monica's gonna go with me.

2304
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:21,416
- That's cute.

2305
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,553
Is your little thug passion boyfriend going to?

2306
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:26,788
Or is he just gonna stay back

2307
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:30,091
and sell more drugs to kids in the street?

2308
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,461
- Well, guess what?

2309
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:36,698
His kid is right here in my belly

2310
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,266
and she's gonna be beautiful.

2311
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,501
Now, listen, I gotta go.

2312
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,301
- What? - We gotta get outta here.

2313
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:41,536
- Hell, nah, Desa Rae.

2314
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,037
You pregnant by this fool?

2315
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:45,707
Hell, nah, you gotta be playing.

2316
01:25:57,519 --> 01:26:00,421
- You can go in, the door unlocked.

2317
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,661
(Desa Rae knocks)

2318
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,006
- Mm, Roc, somebody here to see you.

2319
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:22,477
(door slams)

2320
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,013
- [Roc] I'm a be all right.

2321
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,114
- Hey.

2322
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:26,915
- Hey, what's going on.

2323
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:27,749
- I need to talk to you.

2324
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,584
It's really important.

2325
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:34,622
This letter came today.

2326
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,090
I want you to open it.

2327
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,127
I want you to open it and I want you to read it.

2328
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,562
- What is this?

2329
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:41,729
- I sent your information to an art collector

2330
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,331
and they are interested in your work, Roc.

2331
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:45,667
You do not have to live like this.

2332
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:46,501
- Damn.

2333
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:48,570
This is crazy.

2334
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:53,041
Hey, I really regret breaking up.

2335
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,275
- I know, baby, don't say anything, it's me.

2336
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:55,977
I should have said it at the shop.

2337
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,146
I do love you and I don't want you to do this, Roc.

2338
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,581
Please, I'm begging you.

2339
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,082
Don't do any of this.

2340
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:02,417
- Hey, man, I need you to go out

2341
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,786
and get that paperwork you asked about.

2342
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:05,787
Man, you high?

2343
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:06,955
- Yeah, yeah.

2344
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:08,156
- Is this bitch giving you a problem?

2345
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:09,157
- Bitch?

2346
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:10,358
I should slap the-

2347
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,561
(Desa Rae screams)

2348
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,731
- She's carrying my fuckin' baby, bro.

2349
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,099
- The only reason your ass ain't dead is

2350
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:19,834
because you pregnant with his baby.

2351
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:22,503
- Hey, get up outta here, man.

2352
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:23,738
Unc can fuckin' hurt you, dawg.

2353
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,573
- You better get control of your bitches, dawg,

2354
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,475
I done told you.

2355
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:30,511
Family over everything, nigga.

2356
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:33,248
(Desa Rae cries)

2357
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:42,257
- I'm not coming back here anymore.

2358
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,725
I'm not coming to see you in jail.

2359
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,893
And you not gonna see your daughter.

2360
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:49,530
You either choose between your Uncle Ronnie and us, Roc.

2361
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:51,599
You can't have both.

2362
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:52,667
I'm sick of it.

2363
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:55,903
Who you with, Roc, him or us?

2364
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:56,971
- Man, I'm always with you,

2365
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:57,972
what you talking about?

2366
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,275
- No, you need to choose.

2367
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,977
(dramatic music)

2368
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:17,158
- So Your Honor, for the past three days,

2369
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:19,260
we've listened to Ms. Evans make a bunch

2370
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:22,397
of false accusations without any merits.

2371
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:24,098
My client, Ronald J. Dawson,

2372
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:25,800
is not the man that Ms. Evans wants everyone

2373
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,502
to believe he is.

2374
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:28,970
Ronald hasn't caused nothing.

2375
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,138
Rocky Dawson's on the stand,

2376
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,806
now question him.

2377
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:35,243
- Mr. Dawson, approach the stand, please.

2378
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:46,554
Raise your right hand.

2379
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:47,922
State your name for the record.

2380
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:49,190
- Rocky Dawson.

2381
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,491
- Mr. Dawson, do you solemnly swear

2382
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:52,293
to tell the truth, the whole truth

2383
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:55,396
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2384
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:56,397
- I do.

2385
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:59,734
- [Judge] Have a seat young man.

2386
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:02,337
Counsel, you may proceed.

2387
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,972
- Thank you, Your Honor.

2388
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:07,308
Mr. Dawson, I'd like you to take

2389
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:10,244
a few minutes and tell us about Ronnie.

2390
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,747
- My uncle was like a father for me.

2391
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,950
You know, like the father I never had.

2392
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,051
He definitely cared for me more

2393
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:18,820
than anyone else did.

2394
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:21,389
He was always looking out for everybody,

2395
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,291
especially all the kids in the neighborhood.

2396
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,259
- Mr. Dawson, please tell the truth.

2397
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,328
Let's get this evil man put in jail.

2398
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:28,629
- Yes.

2399
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,198
- Ms. Evans, another outburst like that

2400
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,534
and I will hold you in contempt of court.

2401
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:36,237
Counsel, you may proceed.

2402
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,239
- Thank you, Your Honor.

2403
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,442
So, as I continue, Mr. Dawson,

2404
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,477
I wanted you to tell us

2405
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:44,045
about the type of you and

2406
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,713
your uncle's relationship over the years.

2407
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:48,316
Something's happened and you became very upset,

2408
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,751
is that correct?

2409
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:51,085
- Yeah, that's correct.

2410
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:53,221
I just saw a lot of opportunity to make some money,

2411
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,222
you know what I mean,

2412
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:55,423
to have some doors opened

2413
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:56,824
that probably wouldn't have been opened.

2414
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,025
He didn't like the direction I was going in,

2415
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:01,863
but I don't know, I guess I just got greedy

2416
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:04,065
and just stared doing shit.

2417
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,833
- Watch it, watch it.

2418
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:10,104
- Things that many would probably disapprove of.

2419
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,140
- So what you're saying is the charges

2420
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,242
that Ms. Evans are trying to pin

2421
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:16,043
against my client for the past three days

2422
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:18,279
should be directed towards you?

2423
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,314
Remember, you're under oath.

2424
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:22,917
To be clear, Mr. Rocky Dawson,

2425
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,519
it should be you in jail

2426
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:27,555
for first degree drug trafficking,

2427
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:29,690
assault with a deadly weapon.

2428
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,326
Last but not least, tampering and murder?

2429
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:36,197
- Not murder, but everything else, yeah,

2430
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:39,500
I'm 100% responsible for.

2431
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,769
My uncle had nothing to do with it.

2432
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,705
- Ladies and gentlemen, I think the burden is clear

2433
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:47,175
of who's guilty and who's not.

2434
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:50,812
Justice will finally now be served.

2435
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,713
Your Honor, arrest this man.

2436
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,549
- Bailiff, take him away.

2437
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:55,349
- Damn.

2438
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:58,853
(somber music)

2439
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:08,262
- Go ahead little, man.

2440
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:09,831
We got you, bro.

2441
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:12,433

or responding to any of my letters.

2477
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,251
- I don't know where your letters are

2478
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,552
and if you care anything about your daughter,

2479
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,654
you wouldn't be in there.

2480
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:16,290
- Did you even get a chance to read them?

01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:49,650
(tires screech)

2492
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:55,089
- Take this street money.

2493
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:57,925
Stay the fuck away from my family.

2494
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:11,072
- That's the last time you gonna try me, bitch.

2495
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,808
(dramatic music)

2496
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:19,380
- They look so adorable together.

2497
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,581
- Yes, they do.

2498
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,049
- I know you're so happy Latrel's coming

2499
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,050
to see you more.

2500
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,552
- To see me?

2501
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,554
No, no, no, no, he comes to see his little sister.

2502
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:27,555
I have a hard time getting him

2503
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,856
to go back up to school.

2504
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:31,292
- Isn't it amazing how things turn out?

2505
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:32,827
I mean, you could have never predicted

2506
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:34,161
all of this would happen,

2507
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,297
but it's been such a blessing.

2508
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:37,531
- I love it, I'm happy.

2509
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:39,233
- Me, too, man, you got me having baby fever

2510
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:40,835
like I want one.

2511
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:42,870
- You? You want a baby?

2512
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,138
- Girl, if I could put the wine down.

2513
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:45,773
- That's not gonna happen.

2514
01:35:45,773 --> 01:35:48,375
If you do, just stay away

2515
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,311
from those that resemble Roc.

2516
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,012
They are big trouble.

2517
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:53,147
I still can't believe we rolled up

2518
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:54,882
on Uncle Ronnie like that.

2519
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:56,383
- Oh, my God, girl,

2520
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:58,586
we are Thelma and Louise, too lit.

2521
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,321
- You are my ride or die for sure.

2522
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:02,289
- Every day, all day, mm-hmm.

2523
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:03,724
- He could have killed us.

2524
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:05,493
He's a little crazy.

2525
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:07,661
- Have you spoken to Roc?

2526
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:09,497
- No, it's been a while.

2527
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:11,699
It's been about a month.

2528
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:13,300
The letters stopped, too.

2529
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,236
- Are you worried?

2530
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:16,670
- Yeah.

2531
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:18,239
Yeah, I try not to think about it, so.

2532
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,373
(baby screams)

2533
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:20,775
Latrel, put her down.

2534
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:21,842
- I got it.

2535
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:22,843
You think you could phone Mandy.

2536
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:24,078
I think she's calling.

2537
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:24,912
- You want me to get your phone?

2538
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:25,913
- [Latrel] Yes, please.

2539
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:26,914
- For Mandy.

2540
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:27,882
- Ooh, as in get out Mandy.

2541
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:28,883
- Yes, girl.

2542
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:32,586
Girl, he's just like his father.

2543
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:35,022
As an athlete, it opens many doors.

2544
01:36:35,022 --> 01:36:37,358
- Yeah, and a lot of legs, too.

2545
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:39,059
- I'll be right back.

2546
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:40,161
I'm the mama.

2547
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:42,797
I send you to get stuff.

2548
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:46,400
This girl done called you six times, Latrel.

2549
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,003
Them people swear they in love.

2550
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:51,939
Where's the dip.

2551
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:54,408
Here we go.

2552
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:57,011

2553
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:57,912
Oh, my God.

2554
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,883
- You could've at least invited me to the party.

2555
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:04,351
- I didn't know you were out.

2556
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:05,519
- I'm out now.

2557
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:10,024

2558
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:12,326
