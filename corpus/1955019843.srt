1
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,559
Hey! Freak-boy.
Have a nice trip!

2
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,328
See you next fall!

3
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,562
Leave him alone,
jerk-off.

4
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,348
Oh, or what?

5
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,133
You gonna kick my ass
with some ballet moves?

6
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:36,301
Hey, get a life!
Moron.

7
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,539
Don't listen
to them, okay, Bart?

8
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,309
Hey, melodie and i
are gonna go for a hike.

9
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,413
I'll be home in a bit.
Don't tell mom and dad, okay?

10
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,547
See you at home, buddy.

11
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,655
Hey, Emma.

12
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,157
Hi, Dr. sheffield.
Here's your mail.

13
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,258
Thank you.

14
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,526
Hey. Dad.

15
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,295
Hey, kiddo.

16
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,499
This kid
on the bus--

17
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:16,301
why don't you give us a second,
go inside and get a snack?

18
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,372
Thanks, buddy.

19
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,607
"Hello"
to you, too, Bart!

20
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,646
You sure Cathy
hasn't seen these?

21
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,998
No, sir.

22
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,349
I've kept it from her
like you asked.

23
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,269
Miss Cathy,
is it my turn?

24
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,937
Yes.

25
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,540
Why's she here again?

26
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,176
Bart, sweetie.

27
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,512
Her mom's in the hospital.

28
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,514
The cancer's come back
so she needs us right now.

29
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,249
Can't she stay
with someone else?

30
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,317
No.

31
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,685
Because there is no one else.

32
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,754
Don't eat too many cookies.

33
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,255
You'll spoil your appetite.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,359
Okay, sweetie.

35
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,827
Show me what you did.

36
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,724
Stupid jocks.

37
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,909
See you tonight.

38
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,546
Emma tells me you've already

39
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,048
sold all the tickets
for your show.

40
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,683
Yes, I have.

41
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,718
I really think it's gonna
boost enrolment in the studio.

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,754
You've already got
a waiting list!

43
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,322
Well, I think that's
because all the girls

44
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,556
are lining up
to dance with

45
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,759
my very handsome
assistant instructor.

46
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:57,396
Hey, peanut.
Your babysitter's outside.

47
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,997
-Okay.
-Go.

48
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,833
-Say "bye" to miss Cathy.
Bye, sweetie.

49
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,402
Bye, miss Cathy.
See you tomorrow.

50
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:05,671
She's so cute.

51
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,606
Yes, she is.

52
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,674
Hey, jory.

53
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,075
Where's your brother?

54
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:13,412
Oh, he's out
in the treehouse, I'm sure.

55
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,447
Come on.

56
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,082
He's always
in that treehouse.

57
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,685
He's 12.

58
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,920
Do you remember what
you were doing at that age?

59
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,556
I think
I've totally forgotten.

60
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,824
-Really?
-Yeah.

61
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,826
Maybe I need a reminder.

62
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,027
Maybe I can help
with that.

63
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,762
Yeah?

64
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,568
Hey, Bart?

65
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,738
Hey, you up there?

66
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,986
Where are you?

67
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,555
Come on. Clover, where is he?

68
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,989
Good boy.

69
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,024
Come on, clover.

70
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,661
Bart?

71
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,498
Got ya!

72
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,468
You scared
the crap out of me!

73
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,470
Hey, I found
your girlie magazines.

74
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,972
That's not mine.

75
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah?

76
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,709
Relax! I'm not gonna
tell mom and dad.

77
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,778
Where'd you
get it, though?

78
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,047
In the basement of
the Dracula house next door.

79
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,882
Come and see.

80
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,852
Come on, clover.

81
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,536
Come on.

82
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,089
This place
is really creepy.

83
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,526
I wonder if people died here,
and it's haunted.

84
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,928
Maybe that's why
no one's bought it.

85
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,830
Hey, where are you taking me?

86
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,906
Oh, man. That's gross.

87
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,207
I know.
How do you think they died?

88
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,509
Don't know.

89
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,211
Maybe they came in
through the chimney

90
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,646
and got trapped.

91
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,949
No! Clover! Bad dog!

92
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,120
You okay?

93
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,889
Yeah. Man...

94
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,493
Get out of here!

95
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,928
Go home, you stupid mutt!

96
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,497
Hey, hey.

97
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,065
Looks pretty nasty.

98
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,133
As soon we get home,

99
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,234
you've got to
let dad clean it.

100
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,069
No! Don't tell mom or dad.

101
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,137
They'll wonder where I got it.

102
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,744
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

103
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,116
What are you boys
doing in here?

104
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,918
This is private property.

105
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,254
Do you know what happens
to trespassers?

106
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,722
Nobody lives here.

107
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,023
They do now.

108
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,658
It's been bought.

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,927
I suggest you leave
right now.

110
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,230
Yeah. Come on, Bart.
Let's go.

111
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,602
I just have to review
for my midterm next week,

112
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,603
and I'm set.

113
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,004
Good man.

114
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,539
What about you, Bart?

115
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,141
How'd you do on
that geometry test?

116
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,744
Fine.

117
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,213
Oh, come on.
You know we have

118
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,716
a "no secrets" policy
in this family.

119
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,553
I got a "c."

120
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,655
Oh, Bart...

121
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,123
Now, now,
that's okay.

122
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,125
I got some "c"s
in my day.

123
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,593
You can work
through that.

124
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,060
You just have to study
more. Right, jory?

125
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,266
You know what I think
would really help me work hard?

126
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,535
Is if I had a pet python
to help keep me company

127
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,602
while I study.

128
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,904
Again, no.

129
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,406
Nice try, though.

130
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,873
Honey, no, I'm not having
those things in my house.

131
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,644
Don't they eat mice and rats?

132
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,113
Oh, by the way, I heard that
someone's moving in next door.

133
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,548
-They are?
-Mm-hmm.

134
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,782
It's about time.

135
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,617
I hope they fix that place up.

136
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,853
As it is, it's really hurting
our property values.

137
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,954
I'm sure they will.

138
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,155
Boys, if you're finished,

139
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,657
why don't you help Emma
with the dishes?

140
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,992
Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,231
Thanks, honey.

142
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,832
They're good kids.

143
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,935
We're blessed,
aren't we?

144
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,102
We are.

145
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,238
Thank you, gentlemen.

146
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
That was good.

147
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,076
What's bothering you?

148
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,680
It's just thinking about
little Cindy.

149
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,648
How is Melissa doing?

150
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,685
Not well.

151
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,320
The cancer's metastasized.

152
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,056
What happens when
her mother dies, Chris?

153
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,691
There would be
background checks,

154
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,626
interviews,
people looking into our past.

155
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,094
There are ways
around that.

156
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,996
Melissa wants it, too.

157
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,731
She's offered to have custody
transferred in her will.

158
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,967
Cathy, it's too risky.

159
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,069
Plus, we already have
so many expenses.

160
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,705
The house, the car,
the kids, Emma.

161
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,741
Please, Chris.

162
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,911
That little girl is all alone.
She has no one.

163
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,164
Melodie, you're shivering.

164
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,332
No, we can't.

165
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:38,069
Your parents' room
is right there.

166
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,639
Come on. This way.
We're going to the attic.

167
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,281
-Jory!
-What?

168
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,183
They're here.

169
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,542
She looks like
a witch.

170
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,343
She must be rich,
though. Look.

171
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,579
That guy's her Butler.

172
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,848
Let's get closer.

173
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,984
Bart!

174
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:48,960
Where are
my scrapbooks?

175
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,528
I can't see anything.

176
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,563
Yeah, but I can
hear people.

177
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,431
I'll unpack
them tomorrow.

178
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,466
Come on. Let's get outta here.
This place is creepy.

179
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,368
It's okay,
they won't see us.

180
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,838
-You don't think so?
-No.

181
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,507
We weren't spying.
We swear.

182
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,243
We just live next door
and we saw somebody moving in.

183
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,213
Would you like to come in
for some tea and cookies?

184
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,153
Bart!
Put that down.

185
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,057
John Amos!

186
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,359
John Amos?

187
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,595
Tea and cookies at once!

188
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,265
Good help is so hard
to find these days.

189
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,534
Is there something
wrong with your face?

190
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,035
Bart,
that's rude.

191
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,337
No, I like directness.

192
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,973
It shows strength.

193
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:39,377
My face long ago decided
it would reflect my regret.

194
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,546
What is that
supposed to mean?

195
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,414
It means "time ravages."

196
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,482
Can't you fix it?

197
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,516
Bart.

198
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,901
There's no point

199
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,285
in trying to bring back
what's gone.

200
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,222
I am but a nun.

201
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,624
Where'd you get
all this money from?

202
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,058
Again, rude.

203
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,293
It's family money

204
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,711
passed down
from my father.

205
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,128
But money isn't
everything, Bart,

206
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:02,066
especially when you don't
have anyone to share it with.

207
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,135
You don't have any family?

208
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,538
I did once,
but not anymore.

209
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,910
Now it's just me
and John Amos.

210
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,945
He used to serve
Malcolm, my father.

211
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,915
John Amos, the polaroid.

212
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,949
Ah.

213
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,688
Can I have
a picture with you?

214
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,058
Why do you want
a picture of us?

215
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,660
Stand over here.

216
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,662
You're both
so full of life.

217
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,164
You remind me of myself
when I was your age.

218
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,069
Smile for the camera.

219
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,971
Done.

220
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,383
What is that?

221
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,788
The painting.

222
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,156
That picture I told you that
wasn't to be seen, you idiot.

223
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,325
It must have been the movers.

224
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,492
Put it in the office.
Out of sight.

225
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,494
-As you wish.
-Now!

226
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,397
Boys!

227
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,699
Can I get
another photo?

228
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,201
Stand right there.

229
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,208
Thank you.

230
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,277
This will be
much better.

231
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,580
It's just darling.

232
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,748
I guess.

233
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,249
I'm going to
keep this.

234
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,686
I want to see more of you
in person.

235
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,155
Would you consider
taking after-school jobs

236
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,026
to help me unpack
and tend to my greenhouse?

237
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,495
I have ballet classes,
so that would be hard.

238
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,697
He has a girlfriend, too.

239
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,032
Bart!

240
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,134
I'm sure the girls
love you, too, Bart.

241
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,370
Not really.

242
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,405
Well, they will.

243
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,040
Well, what do you
think about the job?

244
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,708
Well, we would have to
check and make sure

245
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,710
it's okay with
our mom and dad first.

246
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,646
You mean Cathy
and Christopher?

247
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,183
How did you know
their names?

248
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,651
I was told by the realtor.

249
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,687
And I'm Mrs. foxworth.

250
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,425
Well, we'd better
get going.

251
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,127
It's getting
pretty late.

252
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,229
Think about those jobs.

253
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,364
Yeah.

254
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,500
Come on, Bart.

255
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,619
Bart?

256
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,188
Why don't you
come back sometime?

257
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,356
Just you.

258
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,525
Just me?

259
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,627
I think you know
how special you are.

260
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,363
And special people
deserve special attention,

261
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,564
and I do have
a lot of money,

262
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,132
like you noticed,

263
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,567
but money has never
bought me happiness,

264
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,335
and what I really want
is grandchildren

265
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,371
to spoil with gifts.

266
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,474
Gifts?
Like what kind of gifts?

267
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,377
Even a pet snake?

268
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:03,147
Eww. But yes, darling,
even a pet snake.

269
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,183
Bart. Come on.

270
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,517
It's late.

271
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,428
Jory.

272
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,163
Yeah?

273
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,532
Do you ever wonder
about your dad?

274
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,234
Your real dad?

275
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,243
Sometimes.

276
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,178
But, honestly,
i feel like

277
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,513
Chris is my real dad.

278
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,649
Julian
is just, uh...

279
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,251
My biological father.

280
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,622
What brought this up?

281
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,856
I don't know.

282
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,291
Just...

283
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,759
Wondering...

284
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,895
About...

285
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,897
My biological dad.

286
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,300
You don't remember
him at all?

287
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,735
I was too young.

288
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,570
You weren't even born
when he died.

289
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,608
All I really remember
is Chris.

290
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,544
Why do you think
we've never really met

291
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,811
anybody in our family?

292
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,680
None of mom
or dad's family?

293
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,615
You know why. Okay?

294
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,517
Mom's mom is locked up
in the loony bin,

295
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,619
and her dad's dead.

296
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,221
And dad's mom and dad
are dead, too,

297
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,256
so there's really nobody
to meet.

298
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,326
There aren't any cousins
or uncles?

299
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,694
Not everybody's
family's that close.

300
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,262
Okay?

301
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,567
Anyway... I'm gonna
go meet melodie.

302
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,369
Why are you doing,
meeting melodie so late?

303
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,572
She needed help
with the take-home quiz.

304
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,207
I see.

305
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,509
Well, I don't think she could
ask for a better tutor.

306
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,782
Sweetheart...

307
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,919
I heard you talking to jory.

308
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,590
And all
you need to know

309
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,559
is that your father
was a wonderful man.

310
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,462
That's why I named
you after him.

311
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,865
But jory is right.

312
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:39,003
Chris really is your father
in so many more ways.

313
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,007
He supported me
and you and jory,

314
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,676
he's been there for us
since the beginning.

315
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,578
Yeah.

316
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,480
Yeah.

317
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,751
So let's just leave
the past in the past.

318
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,888
You don't want to hurt
Chris's feelings, do you?

319
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,357
By bringing up Bart?

320
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,491
No.

321
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,927
Okay, then.

322
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,897
You should be concentrating
on playing and school

323
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,600
and girls...

324
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,436
Well, maybe not
girls just yet.

325
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,061
Oh, Bart!

326
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,897
I'm so happy you came
to visit with me again.

327
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,732
You know, without
that thing on,

328
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,000
your face doesn't
look that bad

329
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,802
for being 80
or whatever.

330
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,438
Wow! I'm not
that long in the tooth,

331
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,608
but thank you,
I'm flattered.

332
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,445
You planted
all of these?

333
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:57,748
John Amos did,
but I instructed.

334
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,453
Have you thought about
that job?

335
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,790
Yeah, I want to do it.

336
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,092
I wanna save up some money
to get a bow and arrow.

337
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,527
My dad
won't get me one.

338
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,429
Well, if they're not gonna
spoil you,

339
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,897
then I will.

340
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,700
Will you hand me
that tray?

341
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,805
Whoa!

342
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,945
I see you've found
your new little pet.

343
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,980
He's mine?

344
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,615
You got him for me?

345
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,084
What do I do with him?

346
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:36,454
I can't take him home.
Mom and dad will get really mad.

347
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,356
They need to loosen up.

348
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,523
You can keep him here.

349
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,728
Why would you
get a present like this?

350
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,663
You just met me.

351
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,601
Well, what if I told you
I'm not a total stranger?

352
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,403
What do you mean?

353
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,808
What if I told you
that we're related?

354
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,444
That our lineage
is inextricably connected,

355
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,846
like the rose to the Thorn?

356
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,615
You have your--

357
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,685
your great-grandfather's ears
and nose.

358
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,721
What does that mean?

359
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,426
I'm your grandmother, Bart.

360
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:21,031
Your mom takes after me,
doesn't she?

361
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,568
So you got out of
the mental institution?

362
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,604
I was never in
a mental institution.

363
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:29,173
It was an outpatient
clinic.

364
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,442
You make it sound
like I'm crazy.

365
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,544
So why did you
move next to us

366
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,813
and not tell mom?

367
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,515
There were
hard feelings.

368
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,849
Family is complicated.

369
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,652
Very complicated.

370
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:42,820
But nevertheless,

371
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,889
family must always
stick together.

372
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,057
That's why
i was dedicated

373
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,492
to finding you,

374
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,628
and I'm determined
to make things right.

375
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,432
You mustn't tell Cathy
or Chris about me.

376
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,835
I'll tell them myself
when the time is right.

377
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:00,204
My dad's come up with
a "no secrets" policy

378
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,605
in our family.

379
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,107
He did?

380
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,875
Oh, that's very ironic.

381
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,578
There's nothing
wrong with a secret

382
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,079
if it's a little one,

383
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,048
and it's for the best.

384
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:16,587
You're old enough to understand
complicated things like this.

385
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:20,090
We need that big, beautiful
foxworth brain of yours

386
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,092
to make things right.

387
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,101
Lad? Come here.

388
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,108
Let me tell you something.

389
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,978
I've known your grandmother
a long time.

390
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,246
She's a persistent woman.

391
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,582
She's come here
to get her family back,

392
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,617
and to make things right.

393
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,686
I have no doubt
that she'll succeed.

394
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:53,691
In the meantime...
I have something for you.

395
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,899
Now... please stay here
for a minute.

396
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:05,603
I'm going to give you a lesson
in the family history.

397
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:10,574
Your great-grandfather,
Malcolm foxworth,

398
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,110
was a smart man.

399
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,279
He was a tycoon.

400
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,982
He built an empire.

401
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:21,118
And he was once
one of the most powerful men

402
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,087
in America.

403
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,092
And you know what?

404
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:33,797
I see the same qualities he had
in you.

405
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,266
The same energy,

406
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,301
tenacity,

407
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,303
smarts.

408
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,575
You're just like him.

409
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,920
Your great-grandfather's
journal.

410
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,923
One of the only things
left of him.

411
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,058
Malcolm spoke the truth.

412
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,161
Maybe you can learn
a thing or two,

413
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,996
and avoid the moral pitfalls

414
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,966
that have trapped
so many others.

415
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,267
What does that mean?

416
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,572
It means you can choose
a moral life,

417
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,241
a righteous life,

418
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,742
a great life...

419
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:25,049
Or you can choose to shy away
from the light of god.

420
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:33,757
You cannot tell
your parents about this.

421
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,760
You can't even
tell jory.

422
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,874
<i> "July 12, 1943.</i>

423

440
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,684
<i> "It is up to a man</i>

00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,023

445
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,697
<i> "And our children</i>

We will pay for these sins

447
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,403
"...and our pain."

448
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,976
It was
a fairly simple procedure,

449
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:00,911
so I let him sew her up
after I was done,

450
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,946
and he stitched his sleeve
to her arm.

451
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,982
He didn't!

452
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,684
Is it the same guy

453
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,085
who threw up
on the operating table?

454
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:11,622
-Yes.
-Jory!

455
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,389
Thank god, she was
unconscious for that,

456
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,191
or that'd have been
a lawsuit and a half.

457
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,893
Honey, that guy
sounds like an oaf!

458
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,294
What is he still
doing there?

459
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,065
Honey?

460
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,000
Are you okay?

461
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,969
I'm fine.

462
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,273
I got it, Emma.

463
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,742
Who would be
calling at this hour?

464
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,210
Probably
telemarketers.

465
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,311
- Yeah.

466
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,780
Hello.

467
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,449
<i> Hello.</i>

468
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:40,317
Hi, marisha.

469
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,486
She never gets
the time difference right,

470
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,823
does she?

471
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,492
Jory, your grandmother
would like to talk to you.

472
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,427
Yeah.

473
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,262
Oh, honey,
don't tell your grandmother

474
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,797
about the ballet recital.

475
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,999
-Okay.
-Okay?

476
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,969
Hi, grandma.

477
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,472
Yeah, I'm trying to.

478
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,175
Of course.

479
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,745
Chris, I know
she's eccentric,

480
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,313
but why do you
hate her so much?

481
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,148
You don't like her
any more than I do.

482
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,783
What I think
isn't important.

483
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,084
She's his grandmother.

484
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,420
He's allowed
to talk to her.

485
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,822
Why can't i
talk to my grandmother?

486
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,826
Your grandmother?

487
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:24,261
Your mom.

488
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,497
The one
in the mental institution?

489
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,535
Well, Bart, that's, um...

490
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,504
That's very complicated.

491
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:36,173
I haven't spoken to her
in years.

492
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,109
Not since
before Chris and I met.

493
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,913
Honey, are you okay?

494
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,515
You look a little peaked.

495
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,550
Yeah.

496
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,985
Are you sure?

497
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,053
Yes, grandma.

498
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,455
Yes, of course, I'll tell her.

499
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,792
Okay, well, um,
try and finish your dinner.

500
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,261
Can I be excused?

501
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,396
Sure.

502
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,397
I'm sure
I'll hear soon.

503
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:07,004
Yeah. Of course.

504
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,507
I'm gonna go check on him.

505
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,110
I don't need you
to check on me!

506
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,401
What is it, boy?

507
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,174
Come on.

508
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,956
Cathy?

509
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,168
Cathy?

510
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,638
Cathy?

511
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,042
What are you
doing here?

512
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,445
Nothing.
I'm just cleaning up.

513
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:24,081
How long have you
been at this?

514
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,484
A few days.

515
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,886
This looks a lot like
the attic at foxworth...

516
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,456
Chris, how can you
even say that?

517
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,658
I'm not planning on
locking anyone up in here.

518
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,293
I am not mother.

519
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,128
I'm not suggesting
you're mother,

520
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,396
but what are you doing here?

521
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,999
I don't know.

522
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,134
I don't know, I just
want to keep our family safe,

523
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,103
and if we adopt Cindy--

524
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,071
if we adopt Cindy, it's not
gonna help keep the family safe.

525
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,107
Chris, we have
to adopt her.

526
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,476
She's just a little girl.
She has no one.

527
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,544
She's just like we were--
completely alone.

528
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,147
Okay.

529
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,316
Okay.

530
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,318
I hear you.

531
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,921
We'll adopt Cindy, but...

532
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,355
All of this...

533
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,557
It's just in case.

534
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,160
In case anyone
finds out about us.

535
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,030
I couldn't stand the thought of
anyone taking our children away.

536
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,231
Come on.

537
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,466
We are thousands
of miles away

538
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,567
from foxworth hall,

539
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,303
from all of that...

540
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,046
No one's going to
take our children, Cathy.

541
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:31,081
I won't let that happen.

542
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:34,685
Oh, hey, jor.

543
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:35,953
Hey.

544
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,654
What're you up to?

545
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,256
Just finished the laundry.

546
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,493
Where's your brother?

547
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,195
I thought he was up here.

548
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:47,998
Bart?

549
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,533
He's not downstairs, either.

550
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,001
Well, he shouldn't
be outside.

551
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,469
I think he's coming
down with something.

552
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,603
-What is it?
-Bart's not in the house.

553
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,671
What?

554
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,440
Let's not panic.
Come on.

555
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,474
Let's go look for him.

556
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,476
Okay.

557
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,351
Bart!

558
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,685
Bart!

559
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,090
Come on, Bart!
Where are you?

560
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,759
Bart!

561
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,463
--Where is he? Where is he?

562
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,498
Bart!

563
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,701
Bart!

564
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,636
Bart! You out here?

565
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,375
Bart!

566
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:34,444
Bart! Bart! What's wrong?

567
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,249
Mom! Dad! Over here!

568
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,384
Jory!

569
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,651
Jory,
where are you?

570
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,420
Here!

571
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:46,390
Jesus! Bart!

572
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,492
When did this happen?

573
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,461
Bart!

574
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,130
Is he gonna be okay?

575
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,264
Oh, my god.

576
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,265
Oh, my god!

577
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,302
- Okay, I got it.
- Get off of me!

578
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,204
Okay, Bart,
just please--

579
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,473
no! Get off of me!

580
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:06,076
It's okay, it's okay.

581
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:08,211
Can you hold him down?

582
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,813
Yeah, I've got him.

583
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,581
- Take it easy.
- Let go!

584
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,450
Chris, what are
they doing to him?

585
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,153
He's had an adverse reaction
to the antibiotics.

586
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,654
What does that mean?

587
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,423
Means he's allergic
to everything.

588
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:20,724
Why?

589
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,325
Why is he so weak?

590
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,593
His father wasn't weak.

591
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:27,230
I'm not weak.

592
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,598
This is all her fault.

593
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,269
This family is still
paying for her sins.

594
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,137
No, no.
That is not true.

595
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,641
Shh.

596
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,513
I need a crash cart!

597
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,621
<i> Open your eyes,</i>

598
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,256
<i> see what is in front of you,</i>

599
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,092
<i> for the lord said</i>

600
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,526
<i>that you shall learn the truth,</i>

601
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,362
<i> and the truth</i>

602
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,471
<i> Dr. sugarman, line three.</i>

603
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,239
<i> Dr. sugarman, line three.</i>

604
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:13,877
My sweet little boy...

605
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,480
My strong little boy.

606
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,115
Please wake up.

607
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,450
Please...

608
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,719
It's mommy.

609
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,788
Here, dad.

610
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,790
Thank you, son.

611
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,760
Here, honey.
Take one of these.

612
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,662
Oh, Chris,
i don't need it.

613
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,397
It's just valium.

614
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,433
You're a nervous wreck, darling,
and you need to sleep.

615
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,435
You've been up all night.

616
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,772
Hold on to this.

617
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,783
Okay, hon.
Let's let him sleep.

618
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,153
: Okay.

619
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,575
<i> ...and the truth</i>

620
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,727
<i> shall set you free...</i>

621
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:22,878
<i> I am alone</i>
<i> in my search for the truth...</i>

622
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:26,783
<i> And sinners all around me</i>
<i> live with lies and deceit.</i>

623
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,019
<i>People looking into our past...</i>

624
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,254
<i> Do they not know</i>
<i> the hellfire that awaits them?</i>

625
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,857
<i> There are ways</i>
<i> around that.</i>

626
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,459
<i> If lying lips are</i>
<i> an abomination to the lord...</i>

627
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,395
<i> Then secrets must be revealed.</i>

628
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,898
<i> And the sins</i>
<i> of these lustful liars</i>

629
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,433
<i> must be paid for.</i>

630
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,784
It's Cindy's mother...

631
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,653
She's gone.

632
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,755
Oh, hon',
i am so sorry.

633
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,226
Just... I just hope

634
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,961
Bart's gonna be
okay with it.

635
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:15,432
He'll adapt.

636
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,701
He'll have to.

637
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:20,804
A girl needs a home,
and we made a promise.

638
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:27,611
Oh, I have never
been so worried in my life.

639
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:31,348
I was a nervous wreck.
I really was.

640
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,250
We were all
worried, Bart.

641
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,752
But now my boy
is as good as new.

642
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,521
You know, nurse,

643
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,289
I think I can take it
from here. Thank you.

644
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,693
I bet you're excited
to be coming home, son.

645
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:46,963
Well, what would you
like for dinner? Hmm?

646
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,031
You must be famished.

647
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,467
How about, um...
Pork chops?

648
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,769
With, um, applesauce
and, um...

649
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,405
Oh! I can make a yellow cake
with chocolate frosting.

650
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:56,873
Hmm? What do you
think, sweetie?

651
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,808
I'm not "sweet."

652
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,543
People who are sweet
are kind,

653
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:01,978
and people who are kind
are weak.

654
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,415
Where'd you hear
that, Bart?

655
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,750
Nowhere. Why?

656
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,585
We just--

657
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:11,788
I... knew somebody
who used to say that,

658
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,323
that's all.

659
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,325
What about Emma's
famous marshmallow pie?

660
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,793
Hmm? What do
you think?

661
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,429
I think
you talk too much.

662
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,905
Look who's home!

663
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,674
There she is!

664
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,842
Hey, peanut.
Welcome home.

665
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,644
It's official.

666
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,413
Hey, sweetie! Oh...

667
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:38,181
My Cindy's here.

668
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,948
Oh! Aren't we lucky
to have a little girl?

669
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,885
Oh, look who's there--
it's big brother, Bart.

670
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,486
Hi, Bart.

671
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,554
Hey, Bart.

672
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,856
Go give him a hug, Cindy bear.

673
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:47,957
I'll take your jacket.

674
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,728
Oh... she's so cute.

675
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,630
Aww. She loves you, Bart!

676
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,067
Sweetie?

677
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,869
Where are you going?

678
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,372
To work on
my bug collection.

679
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:04,974
Okay.

680
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,747
Let's get started on lunch.

681
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,916
I'm sure he'll be just fine

682
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:15,118
once he gets back into
his regular routine.

683
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,354
Come on.

684
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,931
Bart.

685
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,599
I'm so glad
you're feeling better!

686
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:34,504
I've missed you!

687
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:36,806
Come in.
We must celebrate!

688
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,479
These are good.

689
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,681
Well, you deserve
the best of everything,

690
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,649
including your cookies.

691
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,053
How about a twirl
with your grandma?

692
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,021
You listen
to this old music?

693
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,523
It's not old!

694
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,991
It might as well
be yesterday.

695
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,461
Well, grandma,
i have a question.

696
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,731
You have a painting.

697
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,667
I have many paintings, darling.

698
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,703
This one looks
kind of like my dad.

699
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,638
Not my real dad,
but Chris.

700
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,442
Well, a lot of people
resemble each other.

701
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,010
It must be
a coincidence.

702
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,780
I'm told that I look
like Jean Harlow.

703
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,882
It's in here,
in the living room.

704
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,818
Where did it go?

705
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,421
Well, maybe the fever you had
scrambled your brain.

706
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:26,523
Whenever that happens to me,
i always take a cold bath.

707
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,124
My mom told me
she met Chris

708
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,126
after she stopped
talking to you.

709
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,796
So how do you
know Chris?

710
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:36,199
Bart...

711
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:40,737
Please, tell me.

712
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,673
Why would he say
he never met you if he did?

713
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,909
Tell me!

714
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,945
Or I'll think
you're a horrible liar.

715
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,448
What could be
so horrible?

716
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,183
Did you do something?

717
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:56,486
Something to make them
both hate you?

718
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:58,588
They don't hate me,
do they?

719
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,457
I'm a good woman.

720
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,925
If you're a good woman,

721
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,494
why would he say
he never met you if he did?

722
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,130
Why would you not
want to tell me

723
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,166
that that was
a painting of him?

724
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,905
Because he's my son, Bart.

725
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,652
My dad is your s-son, and...

726
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,855
My mom is your daughter?

727
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,524
Then...

728
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,626
I think you understand.

729
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,929
It's one of my biggest failings
as a parent.

730
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,532
And as a parent,
you feel somewhat responsible,

731
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:44,067
though you aren't
in the least.

732
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:47,036
But still, despite everything,
i love them.

733
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,638
As mothers do.

734
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,708
Why didn't you tell me?

735
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,277
I wanted to protect you,

736
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,879
and there's nothing
that this knowledge can do

737
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:58,398
except complicate things,

738
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,916
but you're very curious,
and now you understand.

739
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:04,254
It's why they've kept me
away all these years.

740
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:06,956
It's why I had my breakdown
in the first place.

741
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,058
It's been awful for me...

742
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,595
And I can only imagine how awful
it must be for you now.

743
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,633
I can't believe it.

744
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,235
Bart, you must
promise

745
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,836
that you will never
speak of this to anyone,

746
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:22,238
or it will ruin your life.

747
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,040
Do you understand me?

748
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,178
Did...

749
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,814
Did you know my real father?

750
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,117
Oh, Bart.

751
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,752
You are too curious,

752
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:39,122
and, as they say,
curiosity killed the cat.

753
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:40,957
Did you know him?

754
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,292
I'm feeling faint.

755
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,561
So... faint.

756
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,997
All I want
is my family back.

757
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,867
Never mind the past.

758
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,236
I guess
i should get going.

759
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,271
My mom will wonder where I am.

760
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:03,713
You hung that painting!
You imbecile!

761
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:06,182
Now his mind is churning
and asking questions.

762
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,217
I'm trying
to handle this delicately,

763
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,752
so I can win him,

764
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,688
and he'll convince them
to take me back.

765
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,855
I'm sorry.

766
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,824
It was
a genuine mistake.

767
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:17,260
Get out of my sight!

768
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:38,281
Sins...

769
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:41,718
Sins must be paid for.

770
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,753
But how?

771
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,227
You almost killed me, clover.

772
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,196
You know that?

773
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,937
Nice one!

774
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,238
Who knocked it over
last time?

775
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,107
So, melodie,
have you decided

776
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,342
which university
you're gonna go to?

777
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,911
Father wants me to go
to college in new england.

778
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:11,914
He says California universities
are overrun by leftists.

779
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,149
Well, when
you're finished,

780
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,884
you should definitely
come back here.

781
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,285
I mean, you're practically
part of the family.

782
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,388
-Mom!
-What?

783
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,791
You don't want to be
part of this family.

784
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:24,027
Our blood is cursed.

785
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,433
I'm just kidding.

786
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,902
It's not like our family's
plagued with dark secrets

787
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,871
or hypocrisy.

788
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,342
Um...

789
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,077
Lunch is ready.

790
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,079
Let's all
get washed up.

791
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,115
<i> "Listen not to false prophets</i>

792
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,351
<i> who will try to bend you</i>
<i> from god's will,</i>

793
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,787
<i> from god's grace.</i>

794
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:54,724
<i> Know that such foul souls</i>
<i> are everywhere.</i>

795
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:57,427
<i> Usually,</i>
<i> it is in the guise of a woman,</i>

796
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,862
<i> sometimes in the guise of men</i>

797
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,732
<i>corrupted by women."</i>

798
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,167
What's wrong
with you? Huh?

799
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,769
Hey! I'm talking to you!

800
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:09,272
Why would you
try and embarrass me

801
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:10,807
in front of my girlfriend
like that today?

802
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:11,908
Huh? And what the hell
were you talking about?

803
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,311
What was I talking about?

804
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,847
Why am I so screwed up, huh?

805
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,850
Why do I have allergies,

806
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,751
and why am I so much shorter
than everybody else in my grade?

807
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:23,920
Hey.

808
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:26,856
You're just different, okay?
That's all.

809
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,057
We're all different.

810
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,860
No! When you live
around a sin,

811
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:33,062
it starts
to infect you.

812
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,898
Why are you talking
like such a weirdo?

813
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,366
What sin?

814
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:39,802
Why don't you ask them?

815
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,809
I think
you need some sleep.

816
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,811
Leave.

817
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:51,481
Now!

818
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,417
Clover!

819
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:31,053
Come here, boy!

820
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,965
Mom? Dad?

821
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,200
Have you seen
clover anywhere?

822
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:45,802
I can't find him.

823
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,403
He'll come around
when he's hungry.

824
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:49,438
He always does.

825
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,074
I'm gonna go outside
and look for him.

826
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,121
I think Bart should
see a professional.

827
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,259
You mean like a psychiatrist?

828
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:13,863
It'll be good
just to get confirmation

829
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,231
that he's going
through a phase.

830
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,939
<i> Sometimes,</i>
<i> things like an accident</i>

831
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:25,241
or a very high fever,
for instance,

832
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:28,511
can exacerbate an underlying
psychological condition--

833
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:31,314
something that's there,
but remains dormant.

834
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:32,448
Let me ask.

835
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,151
Has there any history of abuse,

836
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:36,552
inversion,

837
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,054
deviance,

838
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:39,255
or mental illness
in the family?

839
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,224
No. No.
Not at all.

840
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:43,326
Perhaps we can put together
your genetic history.

841
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,162
His biological
father is dead.

842
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:47,496
Hmm.

843
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,132
Well, you know,
then what I propose,

844
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:52,902
is that before we start him
on any medication,

845
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:54,937
we continue to monitor him.

846
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:58,507
Bart is a very bright,
but also a very...

847
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,176
Sensitive young man.

848
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:03,379
Adolescence can be even more
difficult for somebody like him.

849
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,381
This could just be hormones.

850
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:10,653
But I do believe that, in time,
Bart's gonna be just fine.

851
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:12,421
Bart?

852
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,590
I want to pay you
for today.

853
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,169
Grandma...

854
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,272
Please tell me
about my father.

855
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,173
Did you really
know him?

856
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,076
If you insist.

857
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:37,079
Your father--

858
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,682
Bart--Bart Scott winslow--

859
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:41,317
he was a good man.

860
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:43,052
As you probably know,

861
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,353
he died tragically
in a fire

862
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:45,922
before you were born.

863
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,126
And my mom
introduced you to him?

864
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,663
I knew him
long before your mother did.

865
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,966
How?

866
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:58,534
I don't want to go down
this twisted road.

867
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:01,003
I fear it could
complicate things even more.

868
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:02,204
But look--

869
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,440
I got you a gift.

870
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:07,677
John Amos?
Bring it here.

871
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,346
I think you're really
gonna like it.

872
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:14,483
Whoa.

873
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,619
How did you know
i wanted one?

874
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,422
Because you told me,
and I listened.

875
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:21,090
Now, you should play
with that in the barn,

876
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:23,259
and away from
the valuables here.

877
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,261
Let's go.

878
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:36,272
Why do you think grandma
gets so upset about my dad?

879
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,009
It's a...

880
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,412
A twisted...

881
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:45,281
Twisted web.

882
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,451
I don't know much
about it myself.

883
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,421
Let's try this
again, hmm?

884
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,192
Alright.

885
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:58,227
Watch your feet.

886
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:00,463
Do the Archer's "t."

887
00:50:00,465 --> 00:50:02,164
Hmm...

888
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,532
Elbow up.

889
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,534
Put your forefinger
to the mouth.

890
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,236
String to the nose,
and...

891
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,139
Wow, you're a natural.

892
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:14,610
Let me tell you
something, Bart.

893
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:19,115
You have the potential
to be very powerful.

894
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,617
Malcolm wasn't born
with all of this.

895
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:25,087
No one expected him
to amount to anything.

896
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:28,290
He was small,
but he thought big.

897
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:31,794
I don't want anyone
to take advantage of you.

898
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,430
You're a good boy,

899
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:37,400
but you must look out
for yourself.

900
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,101
Like Malcolm?

901
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,336
Exactly.

902
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:43,139
You have to Blaze
your own path.

903
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,307
The righteous path!

904
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:47,309
And there
will be people

905
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:49,278
that will stand
in your way.

906
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,813
And women will try
to undermine you

907
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,181
at every turn,

908
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:54,150
and use the evil
that they have

909
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:56,585
to get you to do
their wicked bidding.

910
00:50:58,156 --> 00:51:00,222
And you can't let them.

911
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,792
Hmm?

912
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,708
See? Keep up with
your practice,

913
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,177
and one day,
you can be

914
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,845
as graceful
as miss melodie.

915
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:25,081
Class dismissed.

916
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:34,590
Guess what?

917
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,725
I have my mom's
car today.

918
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:41,230
I want to--
i want to, I really do.

919
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:44,300
I just have to get home,
okay?

920
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,801
I'm sorry.

921
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,437
I just have
this feeling that...

922
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,107
Bart needs me.

923
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:58,614
Bart!

924
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,816
Bart!

925
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,818
Are you up in the treehouse?

926
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:08,290
Bart!

927
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,596
Bart!

928
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,365
Bart! Come on.

929
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:22,404
Clover?
Clover, is that you?

930
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:03,445
Ahh!

931
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,696
What are you
doing in here?

932
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,965
Entertaining myself,

933
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:25,534
since you were... busy.

934
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:29,205
Where'd you get
the bow and arrow?

935
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,774
Grandma
got it for me.

936
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,742
"Grandma?"

937
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,645
Bart, look--

938
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,480
I want you to stay
away from this place,

939
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:39,915
and stay away
from that woman.

940
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,750
Okay? She's not
your grandmother.

941
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,237
You don't
want to see

942
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:47,488
what's in front of
your own face, sometimes, boy.

943
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,491
You let your feelings dictate,

944
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:52,228
and it's made you weak.

945
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,862
And a man who feels

946
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,698
is weak.

947
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:15,251
I found clover, Bart.

948
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:18,420
He's dead.

949
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:22,825
Do you know
anything about that?

950
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,697
You think I killed him?

951
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,900
I could never hurt an animal!

952
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,302
If you don't
stay away from this place,

953
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:35,304
I'm gonna tell mom and dad
what you did!

954
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,873
You'd lie?

955
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,042
You want me sent away,
don't you?

956
00:54:40,044 --> 00:54:41,610
Like they sent away grandma!

957
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,045
I'm looking out
for you, okay?

958
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:45,381
You're just worrying me.

959
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:46,915
If you say anything,

960
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,834
I will tell them

961
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,752
that you are fornicating
with melodie in the attic.

962
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:53,455
You didn't
think I knew?

963
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,524
I saw you!

964
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,493
Doing it.

965
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:00,596
It's a sin out of wedlock,
you know.

966
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,898
It's why we're not
friends anymore.

967
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,467
You disgust me.

968
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,614
You're not gonna
say anything now...

969
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:19,782
Are you?

970
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:22,885
Why are you
being like this?

971
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:25,721
Isn't it obvious,
or are you blind?

972
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:28,524
Mom and dad didn't meet
the way they said they did.

973
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,326
They lied to you
about grandma.

974
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:31,827
They lied to you
about everything.

975
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,063
Bart, you're acting crazy.

976
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:38,734
"Crazy"
is denying reality, boy.

977
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,672
It wasn't an accident.

978
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,808
The wire was wrapped
too carefully around clover.

979
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,476
Who would do such a thing?

980
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:49,011
It's just awful.

981
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,579
I don't know,

982
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,581
but I'll talk to the kids
and tell them to be careful.

983
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,883
Emma, if you could keep
an extra eye on the kids, too.

984
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:56,118
Of course.

985
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,416
Bart...

986
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,484
What are you
doing here?

987
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,586
It's late.

988
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,055
I don't want
to go home.

989
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:12,895
Are you okay?

990
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:15,564
It's nothing.

991
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,800
Are you sure?

992
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,603
It's just...

993
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,906
If you do love me,
like you say you do...

994
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:27,643
You're the only one.

995
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,913
Ohh...

996
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:36,118
You and John Amos.

997
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,456
John Amos?

998
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,659
He can't love you,
he's-- he's just a servant.

999
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,127
But a smart one.

1000
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,129
Not really.

1001
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,731
He said I could be
just like Malcolm.

1002
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:52,167
Malcolm?
He told you that?

1003
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:54,169
He told you
about... Malcolm?

1004
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,074
Oh. Darling...

1005
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,944
As much as I would love
to have you stay here,

1006
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:04,513
your parents will be
wondering about you,

1007
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:06,815
and you should be
getting home.

1008
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,840
What have you been
telling my grandson?

1009
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,679
Nothing, ma'am.

1010
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,183
How does he know
about Malcolm?

1011
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,518
I don't know.
I thought you--

1012
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,685
I don't
pay you to think!

1013
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,088
I pay you to do!
What have you told him?

1014
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,890
I've told him
nothing, ma'am.

1015
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:49,157
I believe he mentioned

1016
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,593
reading an old journal
of Malcolm's.

1017
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:52,961
I assumed you gave it to him

1018
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:55,230
in an attempt
to reveal the truth,

1019
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:56,532
as you said
you would.

1020
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,200
I did no such thing.

1021
00:58:58,202 --> 00:58:59,868
Bart is very impressionable!

1022
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,036
And I can't have him

1023
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,238
falling subject
to the wrong influences.

1024
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,873
Now find me the journal

1025
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,942
and get it back to me
immediately!

1026
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:08,944
As you wish.

1027
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:21,790
<i> "Dearest Cathy,</i>

1028
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,158
<i> "i love you.</i>

1029
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,294
<i> "So much.</i>

1030
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:27,963
<i> "And truly,</i>
<i> it's the only consolation</i>

1031
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:31,633
<i> of being locked</i>

1032
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:35,771
<i> "One day,</i>
<i> when we're grown,</i>

1033
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:37,906
<i> "we can leave this behind,</i>

00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,008
<i>"and start a new life together,</i>

1035
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,110
<i> "and never look back.</i>

00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,846
<i> Happy 13th birthday."</i>

1037
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:46,982
<i> "Love, Chris."</i>

1038
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,597
You're so tense.

1039
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,899
But massages are
good for development.

1040
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:06,068
And you're
maturing nicely.

1041
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:11,840
When are you going to
tell me about Bart?

1042
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,742
My father.

1043
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,079
Who was he?

1044
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:20,616
He was my husband.

1045
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:25,253
I don't understand.

1046
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,892
Your mother
was very angry at me,

1047
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:33,295
irrationally so,

1048
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,063
and so she seduced
my husband,

1049
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:37,866
your poor grandmother's
husband.

1050
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:40,769
Why?

1051
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,070
I don't know.

1052
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:44,006
I don't know why
they hate me like they do,

1053
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:46,642
just because I want them
to lead decent lives

1054
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:48,310
and do the right thing.

1055
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,712
Can you blame me?

1056
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,750
But listen to me,
for all the pain,

1057
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:57,152
and the trauma
that this has caused me,

1058
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,254
you're the result,

1059
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:01,890
and I wouldn't wish it
to be any different.

1060
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:05,327
You're here,
and you're alive.

1061
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,262
You remind me
so much of him.

1062
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:10,866
You're the son
that I was meant to have,

1063
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:13,201
more or less.

1064
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:16,238
Oh, Bart.

1065
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,440
Promise me that
you'll never leave me,

1066
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:20,108
like they did.

1067
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,244
Promise me?

1068
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:24,413
I never will, grandma.

1069
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:33,288
Are you okay, jory?

1070
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,427
What's wrong?

1071
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,364
I don't know.

1072
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,905
I guess I'm just worried
about my brother.

1073
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:54,009
Sometimes...

1074
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:56,878
He says
these crazy things.

1075
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,346
Like what?

1076
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,050
I don't know.

1077
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,919
Some stuff
about my parents.

1078
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,091
It just doesn't
make any sense.

1079
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:13,295
Why don't you
ask your mom?

1080
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,733
It's probably nothing.

1081
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:37,185
Want to watch
my Dolly swim?

1082
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:39,020
Mommy gave it
to me.

1083
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,056
You know what?

1084
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,391
She's not your mommy.

1085
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:46,328
And I'm not
your brother.

1086
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,965
And you're not
a part of this family!

1087
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:58,540
Bart! What are you doing?

1088
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:01,176
Stop! Get off!

1089
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,179
Mom!

1090
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:06,114
Oh, my god! Honey!

1091
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,183
What is wrong
with you? Huh?

1092
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:09,217
What is going on with you?

1093
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,819
Why would you try
and hurt Cindy?

1094
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:11,970
Why do you hate
her so much?

1095
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:13,120
She's your sister!
You should love her!

1096
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,790
No! I shouldn't!

1097
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,059
Brothers shouldn't
love their sisters.

1098
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,094
Isn't that right,
Chris?

1099
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:20,262
Alright!
That is enough!

1100
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,498
Let's go!

1101
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,834
Come on!

1102
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:27,452
-What's happening?
-Cindy had an accident.

1103
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:29,069
-What's going on?
-She's okay. Just take her.

1104
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:30,872
Sweetie,
you're gonna be okay.

1105
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:31,940
Shh, it's okay.

1106
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:34,943
-Go on.
-Get off of me, Chris!

1107
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:36,211
Enough of that!

1108
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,115
You get in there.

1109
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:42,450
You stay in there
until you calm down.

1110
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,456
You're not my father!

1111
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,025
You're just
pretending to be!

1112
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:51,827
What are you doing?

1113
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:54,296
He needs to calm down a little,
and we need some time to think.

1114
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:55,931
You're devil spawn!

1115
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,368
You're a sinner!
And a hypocrite!

1116
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:04,172
Fornicating
with his sister!

1117
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,208
Cursing this family!

1118
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,976
You deserve to die!

1119
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:10,378
You all deserve to die!

1120
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:15,317
How does he know, Chris?

1121
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:16,484
How?

1122
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,220
I don't know!

1123
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:19,387
We'll figure it out.

1124
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,422
God knows we've been
through worse.

1125
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:21,857
What are we doing?

1126
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:23,491
What is wrong with him,
that he's like this?

1127
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:25,360
Dr. Phillips
ought to know.

1128
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,195
We can't take him back
to Dr. Phillips!

1129
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,930
What if he tells her
what he knows?

1130
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:30,031
He's unstable,

1131
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,867
so she'll think
he's making it up.

1132
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,335
And what if they want
to lock him up, Chris?

1133
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:35,604
I will never
let that happen.

1134
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:38,006
Chris! Please.

1135
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:40,175
Just-- just
give me a moment.

1136
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,453
Let me out!

1137
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,677
There you are, jory.

1138
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:19,014
What's going on?

1139
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:21,683
Your parents...

1140
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:23,652
As you know them,

1141
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:26,087
are more than
what you think.

1142
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,323
"More" how?

1143
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,342
It's very difficult.

1144
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,360
No child should have to
hear this about their parents.

1145
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:34,429
I want you to be strong.

1146
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,498
Can you be?

1147
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,400
Bart...

1148
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:41,069
Tell me what happened
with your sister.

1149
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:45,173
She's not my sister.

1150
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:50,211
And I'm not Bart.

1151
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:53,548
Then who are you?

1152
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,763
Mr. and Mrs. sheffield.

1153
01:06:43,734 --> 01:06:46,234
I'm concerned
that Bart is displaying

1154
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:49,004
features of
a schizophrenic disorder.

1155
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:52,007
He said he didn't hurt Cindy,

1156
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,041
that it was somebody else.

1157
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:55,276
An old man
he calls "Malcolm."

1158
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,047
Malcolm?

1159
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:01,016
That's impossible.

1160
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,518
Um...

1161
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:07,306
What are our options?

1162
01:07:07,307 --> 01:07:08,490
We'd like to take him
away from here

1163
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:09,624
as soon as possible.

1164
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,126
Well, there's been
some major advances

1165
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:12,460
in electroshock therapy--

1166
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,796
what? No! No.
Absolutely not.

1167
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:16,064
I agree.

1168
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,399
Alright.
If you insist.

1169
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,067
We can try medications,

1170
01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:20,502
but I'd like to keep him
here at the hospital

1171
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,604
just for a few days,
for observation.

1172
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:25,140
But I'm afraid,
if that doesn't work,

1173
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:28,276
our only option left
will be shock therapy.

1174
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:41,156
Hmm.

1175
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:43,525
Well, the tranquilizers have
calmed him down considerably.

1176
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:48,396
So, Dr. Phillips,

1177
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,631
when you were
speaking with Bart,

1178
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,433
did he say anything
else strange at all?

1179
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:53,768
Nothing worth repeating.

1180
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,507
I'll stay here tonight.

1181
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:01,376
Oh, no, no. That--
that won't be necessary.

1182
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,079
I'm his mother.
I insist.

1183
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:08,083
And I'll stay with her.
Thank you, doctor.

1184
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,457
Morning, jory.

1185
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,131
Where's Cindy?

1186
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,900
Emma took her
to the park.

1187
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:01,402
Your mom, uh,
is still at the hospital.

1188
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:03,538
Bart's still resting.

1189
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:10,445
Everything okay, son?

1190
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:14,616
Bart say
something crazy to you?

1191
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,551
About what?

1192
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:17,652
I don't know.

1193
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:18,853
About the family?

1194
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,922
About this family?

1195
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:23,892
I don't know, Chris.

1196
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:26,394
What could
possibly be wrong

1197
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:28,663
with this perfect
family you've created?

1198
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:31,499
What could Bart be so upset
about, huh, Chris?

1199
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,501
Listen, why are you so angry?

1200
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,271
And why do you keep
calling me "Chris"?

1201
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,573
Why don't you ask grandma?

1202
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,912
She's living next door.

1203
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,787
Ah... Dr. dollanganger.

1204
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:55,490
"Sheffield."

1205
01:09:55,492 --> 01:09:58,459
Ah, yes. Of course.

1206
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:03,298
Do come in.

1207
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:15,710
There you are.

1208
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,579
All grown up.

1209
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,916
Corrine.

1210
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:25,220
Call me "mother,"
and give me a hug.

1211
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:27,455
Don't touch me.

1212
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:31,659
What are you
doing here, corrine?

1213
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,561
Haven't you done enough
to Cathy and me?

1214
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,331
I was hoping that
you could forgive me.

1215
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,599
Cathy won't,

1216
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:40,602
but you've always loved me
more than she did.

1217
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:42,403
So you come here

1218
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,239
and you manipulate Bart
into hating us?

1219
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,474
No! I only wanted to love him

1220
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:48,509
the way that a grandmother
loves a grandchild.

1221
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:51,279
I wanted my family back.

1222
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:53,248
But he knows, corrine.

1223
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,849
They both know.

1224
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:57,986
You've poisoned
my family again!

1225
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:00,421
If your family
loves you based on a lie,

1226
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:03,324
then they don't love you at all,
do they?

1227
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:05,660
Oh, you should know,
shouldn't you?

1228
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,562
But I've changed!

1229
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:09,297
I can help them
have a normal life.

1230
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:11,299
I can raise them properly,

1231
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:14,569
and if not both of them,
then just Bart.

1232
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:16,804
He's such a special boy.

1233
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,640
A "normal life?"

1234
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:21,609
Does any of this
seem normal to you?

1235
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,012
There is nothing
"normal" about you

1236
01:11:24,014 --> 01:11:25,847
or about what you think
might help them

1237
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:27,849
in that fetid, rotten
head of yours.

1238
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:30,485
You stay away
from my children, corrine,

1239
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:33,288
or so help me,
i will make it my life's mission

1240
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:36,557
to see you locked back up,
for good this time.

1241
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:37,959
I'm a doctor.

1242
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,661
I have those powers.

1243
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,396
And I have a lot of friends.

1244
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:44,766
Yes, but they don't know
your secret, do they?

1245
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:50,338
Stay away from my children,
corrine.

1246
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,681
Chris, I need to talk to you.

1247
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:01,066
I was out getting

1248
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,450
some last-minute things
for the recital,

1249
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:03,985
and the charge card
was declined.

1250
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,620
-It was?
-Yeah.

1251
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,088
Must've forgot to pay a bill.

1252
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,556
No.

1253
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:10,625
I went to the bank
to withdraw some money,

1254
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:11,726
and there's
hardly any in there.

1255
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:13,361
Cathy, uh,
don't worry yourself.

1256
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:15,063
Chris!
What is going on?

1257
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:16,731
You're a doctor,
you earn good money,

1258
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:18,533
you work all the time.

1259
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:19,967
Why on earth are we
having financial problems?

1260
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:21,336
Darling, please,

1261
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:23,471
don't distract
yourself before the show.

1262
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:27,408
I'm taking care
of everything, okay?

1263
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:31,546
Chris, I'm on
my last nerve here.

1264
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,956
I know you're angry
at Chris and Cathy.

1265
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:46,060
I know you want them to pay
for their sins.

1266
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:51,632
But you have to hold back
until the time is right.

1267
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,804
Malcolm was a smart man.

1268
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,141
He knew that, sometimes,

1269
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:02,777
you have to pretend to be
what people want you to be

1270
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:04,812
in order
to prevail over them.

1271
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:07,682
You have to disguise
your intentions,

1272
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:09,884
so they suspect nothing.

1273
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,021
Do you understand?

1274
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:18,626
Good boy.

1275
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:26,934
I don't revolt
you, do I?

1276
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,508
Melodie?

1277
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:37,678
Hey...

1278
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:40,748
I'm sorry.

1279
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,990
Hey, there.

1280
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:51,859
How are you
feeling, Bart?

1281
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:53,094
Okay.

1282
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,063
And how is Malcolm feeling?

1283
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:01,569
He went away.

1284
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:03,538
Oh, he did, did he?

1285
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,540
Yeah.

1286
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:09,010
And I don't think
he's coming back, either.

1287
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:10,845
Huh.

1288
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,149
Cindy, honey!
Hurry up.

1289
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,684
We don't want to be late
for the recital.

1290
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:18,653
Hi, Dr. Phillips.

1291
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:22,089
Yes, the medications
have worked tremendously.

1292
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:24,826
No. No more episodes.

1293
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:27,962
He's been
perfectly stable and happy,

1294
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,764
and completely abandoned

1295
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:31,899
this fictitious
"Malcolm" character.

1296
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,970
Thank you. Yes.
I'll, uh, be in touch.

1297
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:39,774
Bart, honey, are you sure

1298
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:42,710
you don't want to come
to the recital?

1299
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,247
Okay.

1300
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:47,849
See you there.

1301
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:49,484
Bye, darling.

1302
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:50,551
-Bye, Cindy.
-Bye-bye.

1303
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:52,720
Break a leg.

1304
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:58,259
Thank you. Thank you,

1305
01:14:58,261 --> 01:15:01,195
and welcome to the sheffield
dance academy's fall recital.

1306
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:04,765
We are so excited to show you
what we've been working on,

1307
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:07,168
and we hope you enjoy it.

1308
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,171
So without further ado,
let's begin.

1309
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:17,712
And arms in first position...

1310
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:19,747
And in fifth...

1311
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,549
And open.

1312
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:28,256
And... up.

1313
01:15:28,258 --> 01:15:30,057
And...

1314
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,298
Oh!

1315
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,033
Cathy!

1316
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,001
Don't move your leg.

1317
01:15:41,104 --> 01:15:42,169
-My knee--
-shh, shh...

1318
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,005
Chris, Chris, my knee!

1319
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:45,106
Oh, god!

1320
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:46,007
You're fine.
You're gonna be fine.

1321
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:47,108
Oh, god!

1322
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,743
Son, go get an ambulance.

1323
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:50,912
Okay.

1324
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:52,547
Oh, Chris... my knee.

1325
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:53,881
You're gonna be okay.
I'm here.

1326
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,689
Chris, I'm fine.

1327
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:02,990
I can manage.

1328
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:05,593
I'm gonna have to,
if I'm going to dance again.

1329
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:09,063
Hi, sweetie.
It's good to be home. Mwah.

1330
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,998
Hey, honey.

1331
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:16,571
Does she know

1332
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:19,140
she's never gonna
dance again?

1333
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:21,708
They told her at the hospital,
but it hasn't sunk in yet.

1334
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:24,245
Mind your leg.

1335
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:25,846
Well...

1336
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:27,348
I think it's a good thing.

1337
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,950
You know, I can, uh...

1338
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:31,352
Ooh. Focus on myself,

1339
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:33,588
my beautiful family.

1340
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,790
Where's my little Cindy?

1341
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:38,159
Emma put her
to bed already.

1342
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:41,262
Bart?

1343
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,830
Wanna come give me a hug?

1344
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,673
Grandma!

1345
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:54,809
Darling!

1346
01:16:57,647 --> 01:17:01,115
Jory, darling.

1347
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,384
Your grandmother is here.

1348
01:17:03,386 --> 01:17:04,885
Look at you!

1349
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:07,154
My luggage--
it's in the trunk.

1350
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:08,723
I'll get it.

1351
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,893
Thank you
so much, Amy.

1352
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:14,862
-"Emma."
-Indeed.

1353
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,263
Cathy...

1354
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:19,834
I was so sorry
to hear about your accident.

1355
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:23,404
The moment jory told me,
i knew what I had to do.

1356
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:25,072
-You came.
-Of course!

1357
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:26,807
Who else is going to
teach your classes?

1358
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,779
Amy? Do you have
sugar for the coffee?

1359
01:17:34,017 --> 01:17:35,349
Still "Emma."

1360
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:40,354
It's my guilty little pleasure.

1361
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,959
Well, I see you haven't lost
your<i> joie de vivre.</i>

1362
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:47,862
I just hope I have mine
when I'm your age.

1363
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:53,668
So, how long were you
planning on staying with us?

1364
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,704
As long as it takes
to put jory into tiptop shape.

1365
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:58,439
He has a bright
future ahead of him.

1366
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:00,041
He does.

1367
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:02,276
I've taught him
everything I know.

1368
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:03,811
Exactly.

1369
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:05,279
And now with your knee

1370
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,181
and your delightful
little girl,

1371
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,083
I can relieve
some of your burden,

1372
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:10,951
and take jory even further.

1373
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:13,821
Jory?

1374
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:17,124
Why don't you take your
grandmother's bags upstairs?

1375
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:18,793
To the guest room.

1376
01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:20,227
Yeah.

1377
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:23,030
I'm sure you'd like to
get settled in, marisha.

1378
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,067
I'll just finish my coffee.

1379
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:37,478
Christopher,
you startled me.

1380
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,313
A ballerina who smokes?

1381
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:42,349
We all have
our unsavory habits,

1382
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:45,186
don't we, now?

1383
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:48,189
Haven't I done
enough for you?

1384
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:49,824
You promised to stay
out of our lives.

1385
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:58,099
The arrangement we've made
is no longer working for me.

1386
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:06,140
Chris? Honey?

1387
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:08,275
Sweetheart.

1388
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:10,311
Are you okay?

1389
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:15,149
What is it?

1390
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:22,389
It's marisha.

1391
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:24,024
She knows about us.

1392
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:30,931
A couple of years ago,

1393
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,433
her studio wasn't
doing well...

1394
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,138
She came to me
for money.

1395
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:39,140
And when I refused...

1396
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:43,511
She threatened to turn us in
and take jory away.

1397
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:46,814
She's blackmailing us?

1398
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:49,150
Chris, you should have told me!

1399
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,354
I didn't want to worry you.

1400
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,556
I'm gonna kill her.

1401
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:57,091
No.

1402
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,226
No!

1403
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:01,462
We have to play this
smart, Cathy.

1404
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:04,932
She has all the leverage.

1405
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:07,568
Don't do or say anything rash
until we come up with a plan.

1406
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,412
It's the hospital.

1407
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:19,880
I got to go.

1408
01:20:19,882 --> 01:20:20,881
Okay.

1409
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:25,920
We'll figure this out.

1410
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:28,522
I promise.

1411
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:31,192
This family
means everything to me.

1412
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,572
Cathy, darling.

1413
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:21,642
I'm looking for
the reduced-fat mayonnaise.

1414
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:24,445
I want you to get the hell
out of my house,

1415
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:26,080
or I'm calling the police.

1416
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,948
I beg your pardon?

1417
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,416
I know what
you're doing,

1418
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:32,419
and I will never
let you have jory.

1419
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,088
He's mine.

1420
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,223
Look.

1421
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:39,026
I know how
a mother feels about her son,

1422
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:40,561
and how protective she can be,

1423
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,463
but this
is for the best.

1424
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:45,432
You're not
taking my son.

1425
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:48,535
I'm looking after
his best interests.

1426
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:50,604
He has a future,

1427
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:51,906
and back in New York,

1428
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,107
he'll no longer
have to participate

1429
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:54,508
in this putrid farce.

1430
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,443
It's damaging him.

1431
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:58,212
Look at what it's done
to your other boy.

1432
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:00,581
He's nuts,
and no wonder.

1433
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,053
Oh, Bart, honey!
Don't listen to her.

1434
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,354
She doesn't know
what she's saying!

1435
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:11,158
Bart? Bart!

1436
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:13,694
Oh, dammit.

1437
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:15,161
You think I'm afraid of you?
Well, I'm not!

1438
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:16,664
But you're afraid
of what I can tell everyone,

1439
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:17,932
aren't you?

1440
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:20,668
Do what you're gonna do.

1441
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,237
I just don't
give a damn anymore.

1442
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,041
Bart!

1443
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:41,021
Hello, Bart.

1444
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:45,225
I know I'm supposed to pretend
like it's all okay,

1445
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:48,095
but their sinning
makes me sick.

1446
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:51,231
Their hypocrisy--
all of them.

1447
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:55,235
Well, if sin and hypocrisy
don't sit well with you...

1448
01:22:55,237 --> 01:22:57,338
I'm not sure if, uh...

1449
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,606
If what?

1450
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:02,176
I shouldn't say anything.
It's not my place.

1451
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:05,145
It is your place.

1452
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,747
You're just a servant,
John Amos.

1453
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:08,983
You don't get to decide
what to tell me

1454
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:10,384
and what not to tell me.

1455
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,487
I'm just saying

1456
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:17,358
that if sin and hypocrisy
don't sit well with you,

1457
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,027
maybe you shouldn't be
with your grandma either.

1458
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:21,595
What does that mean?

1459
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,330
Are you saying--

1460
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:27,167
I'm saying that she pretends
to be all high and mighty...

1461
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:31,105
But she's a sinner, too.

1462
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:32,539
No, she's not!

1463
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,208
How dare you?

1464
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,110
Listen to me, Bart.

1465
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:38,279
Don't you think that

1466
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,447
Chris and Cathy learned
their behavior somehow?

1467
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:43,217
Where do you think
they got it from?

1468
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:45,219
Some years ago...

1469
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,405
I discovered

1470
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:49,590
that she had had relations
with her own uncle.

1471
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,360
No.

1472
01:23:55,598 --> 01:23:58,599
That's how
your mom and Chris were born.

1473
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:07,241
So I'm paying for their sins?

1474
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:24,258
Hello?

1475
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,735
Bart?

1476
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:45,312
Oh, my god.

1477
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:48,348
<i> Jory, she can't</i>
<i>come to the phone right now.</i>

1478
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,817
Can I just please
just talk to her?

1479
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:50,818
<i> I can't.</i>

1480
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,220
Melodie? Melodie!

1481
01:24:53,222 --> 01:24:54,354
I-i know you're there.

1482
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:57,558
- Hello?

1483
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,293
Hello?

1484
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,435
Jory, there's something
i want to discuss with you.

1485
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:09,670
About what?

1486
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:10,737
About your
so-called parents.

1487
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,406
Grandma, I know already.

1488
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:14,141
Okay?

1489
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,446
I am so sorry.

1490
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,851
They're ill, jory.

1491
01:25:23,853 --> 01:25:26,420
Crazy.

1492
01:25:29,225 --> 01:25:31,258
Listen to me.

1493
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,596
You have such a bright
future ahead of you,

1494
01:25:35,598 --> 01:25:38,265
but you need to
get out of this mess.

1495
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:40,200
I'll book a ticket.

1496
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:42,703
We can both go
back to New York.

1497
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:44,571
We could leave first
thing in the morning

1498
01:25:44,573 --> 01:25:45,772
and never look back.

1499
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,747
Bart?

1500
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:02,156
Hello, dear.

1501
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:06,827
I've come back.

1502
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,731
So it was you
at the recital.

1503
01:26:13,536 --> 01:26:16,603
I want you
to stay away from my children

1504
01:26:16,605 --> 01:26:19,273
and leave us
the hell alone!

1505
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:21,308
Cathy, I may never get
another chance to say this--

1506
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,743
I prayed!

1507
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:26,346
I prayed
that you had died.

1508
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,816
I prayed that you'd died
in that nut farm!

1509
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:32,386
Oh, Cathy,
if only you knew how it hurts

1510
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:35,355
to hear you say those things
after all these years.

1511
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,957
I only came here
to be near you.

1512
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:38,525
I don't want you near me!

1513
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,561
Move!

1514
01:26:40,563 --> 01:26:43,230
Go away! I hate you!

1515
01:26:43,232 --> 01:26:44,431
Please, give me
another chance.

1516
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:45,799
This time,

1517
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:47,467
I can be the loving mother
that I should have been

1518
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:48,769
to you and Chris.

1519
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:50,470
You gave up
our love!

1520
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:53,640
You gave up our love
for money,

1521
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:56,877
and for this--
for damn jewelry!

1522
01:26:59,515 --> 01:27:02,649
You locked us in an attic
for<i> three years!</i>

1523
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,720
Cathy, I always manage
to make the wrong decisions.

1524
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:09,289
I think they're right
when I make them...

1525
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:12,859
But they never
prove anything but wrong.

1526
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:16,396
You stole my childhood!

1527
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:22,236
I've made terrible mistakes.

1528
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,872
Everything
is falling apart,

1529
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:27,541
because of you.

1530
01:27:27,543 --> 01:27:28,742
Everything is falling apart!

1531
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,410
My life!

1532
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:32,813
Everything Chris and i
have worked to build!

1533
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:38,719
Did I damage you both so deeply
that you can never heal, Cathy?

1534
01:27:39,822 --> 01:27:41,788
Do you really
love your brother?

1535
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:47,261
Yes, I love him.

1536
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:51,431
You made me love him.

1537
01:27:56,038 --> 01:27:57,804
What the hell are you doing?

1538
01:27:57,806 --> 01:27:59,306
I'm putting an end

1539
01:27:59,308 --> 01:28:01,441
to the affliction
that plagues this family.

1540
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:12,286
Are they alive?

1541
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:17,557
Watch them.

1542
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:19,660
I'm going to get
the wheelbarrow.

1543
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:21,728
We're taking them
to the barn.

1544
01:28:23,565 --> 01:28:25,565
Be strong, boy.

1545
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,652
Grandma.

1546
01:28:47,089 --> 01:28:49,556
Oh, darling...

1547
01:28:49,558 --> 01:28:50,924
What's happened?

1548
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:53,960
Get me some rope. Now!

1549
01:28:53,962 --> 01:28:55,062
John Amos.

1550
01:28:55,064 --> 01:28:56,863
Have you gone mad?

1551
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:58,398
Yes, I have.

1552
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,633
From wasting my life

1553
01:28:59,635 --> 01:29:03,837
serving you, you weak,
undisciplined wretch!

1554
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,472
You're a servant.

1555
01:29:05,474 --> 01:29:06,740
It's your damned job.

1556
01:29:11,647 --> 01:29:13,880
What have you done
to my daughter?

1557
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,584
Do you have any idea
how hard it's been,

1558
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:19,086
tying my life to yours?

1559
01:29:19,088 --> 01:29:21,088
To serve
a once-great family

1560
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:23,090
that's gone down
the path of sin?

1561
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:26,660
That's tarnished its name,
and through its name, mine?

1562
01:29:26,662 --> 01:29:28,662
We're not really family.

1563
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,664
You're an employee.

1564
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:33,633
I thought that, perhaps,
you had learned something

1565
01:29:33,635 --> 01:29:35,769
when you gave these sinners up.

1566
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:37,738
I thought that
you had rejected

1567
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:38,872
the sin you had created,

1568
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,006
and moved on!

1569
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:41,541
No.

1570
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,910
You wanted it all back!

1571
01:29:43,912 --> 01:29:45,879
You and your children.

1572
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,382
And your children's
children!

1573
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:50,484
All tainted!

1574
01:29:50,486 --> 01:29:52,052
All the devil's spawn.

1575
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:54,554
You sound insane.

1576
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,723
Just like
my damned, crazy mother.

1577
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:58,725
Really?

1578
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:06,700
What are you doing?

1579
01:30:06,702 --> 01:30:08,168
You're weak, corrine.

1580
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:10,137
But I am strong.

1581
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:12,639
I have been given
the strength of the lord,

1582
01:30:12,641 --> 01:30:15,542
and I will break
this cycle of abomination,

1583
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:17,144
and make you pay!

1584
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:20,147
I will set this place ablaze.

1585
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:22,849
No!

1586
01:30:24,453 --> 01:30:26,453
I must.

1587
01:30:27,556 --> 01:30:30,023
These women
must pay for their sins.

1588
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:32,125
The lord whispered it in my ear.

1589
01:30:32,127 --> 01:30:34,194
There's nothing of the lord
in you.

1590
01:30:34,196 --> 01:30:36,430
You're just...

1591
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:38,131
A false prophet.

1592
01:30:38,133 --> 01:30:40,000
Don't you mess with me, Bart,

1593
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:43,003
or you will end up
just like your damned dog!

1594
01:30:44,473 --> 01:30:45,739
--Bart! Run! Run!

1595
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:46,673
You little bastard!

1596
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:47,841
Bart!

1597
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:51,845
No! Let go!
Get off of me!

1598
01:30:51,847 --> 01:30:53,113
John Amos, stop it!
Stop it!

1599
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,985
You'll never
get away with this!

1600
01:31:00,823 --> 01:31:03,623
Oh, I believe I will.

1601
01:31:05,828 --> 01:31:08,528
The lord protects his own.

1602
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,832
Don't, don't, don't...

1603
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:15,068
Bye, corrine.

1604
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:34,988
Jory, what
are you doing?

1605
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,690
I'm going back
with marisha.

1606
01:31:36,692 --> 01:31:38,024
Son, listen to me.

1607
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:39,192
I'm tired
of listening,

1608
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:40,560
about all of
your lies, okay?

1609
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:44,731
I promise, no more lies.

1610
01:31:44,733 --> 01:31:47,901
We'll get everything
out in the open, right now.

1611
01:31:50,906 --> 01:31:52,606
Where's your mother?

1612
01:31:52,608 --> 01:31:55,208
Next door.

1613
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:56,877
Oh, god.

1614
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,213
Just, please, stay here.

1615
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:10,624
Oh, my god! Oh!

1616
01:32:10,626 --> 01:32:12,192
Mother, what's going on?

1617
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,693
John Amos
has gone crazy

1618
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,162
and he's locked us
in here.

1619
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:16,630
What? Oh, my god!
We're gonna die in here?

1620
01:32:16,632 --> 01:32:18,765
I may never get another chance
to say this to you--

1621
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:21,535
how much I've loved you,
I've loved all four of you,

1622
01:32:21,537 --> 01:32:23,803
and I'm horribly sorry
for everything that I've done.

1623
01:32:23,805 --> 01:32:25,572
If I could take it back,
i would.

1624
01:32:25,574 --> 01:32:27,207
Can you
forgive me?

1625
01:32:40,022 --> 01:32:43,089
Dad, mom and grandma
are trapped in the barn,

1626
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:44,891
and the barn's on fire!

1627
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,226
Take me to them.

1628
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:50,564
They're in there! Hurry!

1629
01:32:50,566 --> 01:32:52,799
Get out of here!
Stay low!

1630
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:00,774
Cathy, are you in there?

1631
01:33:02,678 --> 01:33:04,911
Cathy, can you hear me?

1632
01:33:14,623 --> 01:33:16,256
Oh, my god! Chris!

1633
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:18,758
Please take her!

1634
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,760
I've got you, Cathy.
I've got you.

1635
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,132
Hang on, baby.

1636
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:33,807
Grandma!

1637
01:33:35,377 --> 01:33:37,243
Come on, grandma!
Get up!

1638
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:38,645
Go, darling! Go!

1639
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:42,215
Little beast!
You'll get burned, too!

1640
01:33:42,217 --> 01:33:43,183
No!

1641
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:52,092
Woman...

1642
01:33:52,094 --> 01:33:54,628
You are
the gateway to my hell.

1643
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:55,929
Go, Bart! Go!

1644
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:07,641
Bart!

1645
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:09,309
Dad! Go back in there
and save her!

1646
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:11,044
I saw the smoke.
Are you okay?

1647
01:34:11,046 --> 01:34:12,646
Jory, take him.

1648
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:14,381
Jory, let go!

1649
01:34:14,383 --> 01:34:16,683
No! Grandma!

1650
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:18,351
We can't
just let her burn!

1651
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:27,293
Oh, my god, Chris.
Mother.

1652
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,230
Mother.

1653
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,183
Are you okay?

1654
01:34:52,421 --> 01:34:53,920
Oh, my god!

1655
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,956
I saw the smoke,

1656
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:58,224
and then I couldn't
find you, jory.

1657
01:34:58,226 --> 01:34:59,259
Marisha,
this is not the time.

1658
01:34:59,261 --> 01:35:00,360
Dad! Dad.

1659
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,696
I got her.
Don't worry.

1660
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:03,930
Darling.

1661
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,165
Are you okay?

1662
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:06,199
I'm fine.

1663
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:08,001
This family is insane,

1664
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:09,436
and you must
come live with me.

1665
01:35:09,438 --> 01:35:11,104
No, grandma.

1666
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:12,706
What do you mean, no?

1667
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,207
You want to continue to
live here with these mad people?

1668
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:16,376
Enough!

1669
01:35:18,013 --> 01:35:20,847
They might be crazy,
but they're my family.

1670
01:35:22,951 --> 01:35:24,784
And I love them.

1671
01:35:24,786 --> 01:35:26,753
I'm staying here.

1672
01:35:28,123 --> 01:35:30,990
And if you even<i> think</i> about
turning Chris and Cathy in,

1673
01:35:30,992 --> 01:35:32,959
I'll never forgive you.

1674
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:35,395
I'll never speak to you again.

1675
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:41,167
I think it's time for you
to go home now, grandma.

1676
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:46,172
I'll see you next Christmas.

1677
01:36:07,229 --> 01:36:10,196
Hey. Come here.
Good girl. Good girl.

1678
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,236
Want to go get it?

1679
01:36:17,372 --> 01:36:19,873
Melodie.

1680
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:22,208
Hi.

1681
01:36:27,082 --> 01:36:30,450
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

1682
01:36:31,787 --> 01:36:34,053
I told you
that you could be honest,

1683
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:35,455
that you could trust me,

1684
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:37,423
and when you did...

1685
01:36:37,425 --> 01:36:39,092
I freaked out.

1686
01:36:40,829 --> 01:36:42,428
But...

1687
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:45,431
That doesn't change
the way I feel about you, jory.

1688
01:36:46,535 --> 01:36:48,134
It doesn't?

1689
01:36:54,009 --> 01:36:56,976
Oh, I've missed you so much.

1690
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:59,078
You have?

1691
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,980
You have!

1692
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:04,884
What did you miss
the most?

1693
01:37:07,889 --> 01:37:09,989
I can show you.

1694
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:14,594
Bart!

1695
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:17,230
I want to see, I want to see.

1696
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:25,572
Is he chewing the mouse?

1697
01:37:25,574 --> 01:37:27,140
No.

1698
01:37:27,142 --> 01:37:29,242
They're just playing.

1699
01:37:29,244 --> 01:37:31,110
Are you sure
they're just playing?

1700
01:37:33,081 --> 01:37:34,380
Yes, Cindy.

1701
01:37:41,156 --> 01:37:43,456
I'll be in my room.

1702
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:45,859
No, no. Young lady,
snakes are icky.

1703
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:46,926
We're going to go to the park.

1704
01:37:46,928 --> 01:37:49,596
Dr. Phillips
is a miracle-worker.

1705
01:37:49,598 --> 01:37:52,966
Yes, I think
he's back to his old self.

1706
01:37:52,968 --> 01:37:55,602
Amen! Our boy is back.
Now let's go get some worms.

1707
01:37:57,172 --> 01:37:59,372
Well, I'm gonna get
some of that pie.

1708
01:38:07,315 --> 01:38:09,949
We are blessed,
aren't we?

1709
01:38:09,951 --> 01:38:12,418
To have
such a wonderful family?

1710
01:38:13,488 --> 01:38:15,622
Yes, we are.

1711
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,380
Jory? Come on.

1712
01:38:44,519 --> 01:38:46,552
Jory?
