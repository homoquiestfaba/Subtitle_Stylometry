1
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,239
On behalf of the sons of Italy,

2
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,239
we welcome you,
Mr. marciano. Champ.

3
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,740
Pound for pound,
the greatest...

4
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,249
Ah, hey, hey, enough. Enough.
Just call me rocky. Geez!

5
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,749
Rocky.

6
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,250
And since you've been
the inspiration

7
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,259
to every Italian-American
across this country

8
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,760
for longer than most
of us can remember...

9
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,259
Get on with it, gino.
Let's hear the rock.

10
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,769
I want to present to you this
sportsman of the century award.

11
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,790
.

12
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,280
<i>Basta. Come on. Sit down. .</i>

13
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,290
Ah, terrific.

14
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,790
Thank you.

15
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,789
I don't know what the heck
I'm gonna do up here.

16
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,790
I mean, I don't sing,
I don't dance.

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,810
But just to be gracious, I'll
take on any guy in the house.

18
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,799
.

19
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,299
Thank you all.

you coming here.
Thank you.

32
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,829
You know, uh, when you knocked
out walcott back in '53,

33
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,330
my dad and every Italian in the
neighborhood, they celebrated for a week.

34
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,339
He'd love to meet you.

35
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,339
Well, I'd love to, but I've got a
previous engagement in Chicago.

36
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
.

37
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,849
Damn.

38
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,855
Hey, champ.
Where you goin'?

39
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:26,850
I'll be right back.
I forgot somethin'.

40
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,390
Boston burgers!

41
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,890
.

42
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,910
Pop, hey, pop.

43
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,410
What are you doin' here
so early?

44
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,410
Get out of sight.
You want to get me fired?

45
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,419
Huh, what happened to my lunch?

46
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,419
Hey, marchegiano.

47
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,419
What's your kid
doin' here again?

48
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,919
It ain't lunch yet.

49
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
.

50
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,429
Oh, God, my hand!
My hand!

51
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,940
Shut it down.
Shut it down.

52
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,929
Come on. Come on.
Get him to the hospital..

53
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,430
Get him out of here.

54
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,950
All right, that's it. Ain't nothing more to see.
Back to your business.

55
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,939
I hate this place, papa.

56
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,439
You're never gonna
work here, rocco.

57
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm tellin' you. Never.

58
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,480
Everything ok in there, rock?

59
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,970
Yeah, everything's fine now.
I'll be right out.

60
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,489
<i>...Nazi poster boy
who k.O.'D Joe Louis 2 years ago. .</i>

61
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,490
<i>So, tonight, Louis fights
not just for vengeance, .</i>

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,500
<i>But for freedom and democracy
the world over. .</i>

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,010
What're you putting
that up for?

64
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:55,999
I like to see
what I'm hearing on the radio.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
You're putting up a picture
of <i>moolie in your own home? .</i>

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey, Joe Louis is
the champion of the world.

67
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,009
What have you ever done
in your life?

68
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,009
I did not go overseas
to fight the Germans

69
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,510
to come home here
and... and live off charity.

70
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,519
It's not charity.
It's coupons for food.

71
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,519
It's from the church...

72
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,519
.

73
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Enough.

74
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,029
It's starting, papa.

75
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,029
Uh, you go ahead, rocco.

76
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,530
I'm... I'm coming right down.

77
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,039
The big fight is going on.

78
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,539
We finish this
a little later. Hm?

79
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Why you let him
listen to that, huh?

80
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,049
The boy likes boxing.
What is the harm?

81
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,549
<i>The cruelest sport. .</i>

82
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,050
<i>Oh, and an explosive
right to the jaw, hurting schmeling. .</i>

83
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,565
<i>Louis is all over the big
German here in round 1. .</i>

84
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:56,059
<i>A barrage of punches
to the head .</i>

85
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,559
<i>As schmeling starts
to crumble against the ropes. .</i>

86
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
<i>A dynamite right,
and schmeling goes down.</i>

87
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,069
<i>.</i>

88
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,075
<i>But he's up on the count of 2.
He staggers up, .</i>

89
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:09,069
<i>And a crushing right slams
schmeling down for the 3rd time. .</i>

90
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,570
<i>It doesn't look like
Max is gonna make it. .</i>

91
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,079
<i>He can't get up.
It's over. It's all over. .</i>

92
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,079
Yes!

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,079
Yes!

94
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,079
Louis beat schmeling.

95
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
.

96
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,090
Louis beat the Nazi.

97
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,589
Louis is the champion
of the world.

98
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,090
.

99
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,599
What? Oh.

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,110
He's the champion of the world.

101
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,599
Louis beat schmeling.
All right.

102
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Louis! Louis! Yeah!

103
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,120
Knock it off, you little
hooligans, or I'll call the cops.

104
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,109
There you go,
Mrs. drago.

105
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,609
Ah, thank you.

106
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,610
Enjoy the day. You, too..

107
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Next.

108
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,619
Come along.

109
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,630
Paying with these today,
Mr. Murphy, ok?

110
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Marchegiano,
can't you read English?

111
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,130
Cash customers first.

112
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,130
Back of the line.

113
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,639
Hey, papa.
What about the food?

114
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Where are you go... papa.

115
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,149
Come on, Allie.
Let's get to the back...

116
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,150
Next.

117
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Crooked. Again.

118
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,660
.

119
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,680
Sit with me for a moment.

120
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
.

121
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,679
You know, rocco,

122
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,680
I come to America on the
same boat as your grandpa.

123
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,200
Oh, the promises we had
ringing in our ears.

124
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,190
We couldn't hear nothing else.

125
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,690
Instead,

126
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,690
we become dagos, wops.

127
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
They say we're lazy.

128
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,700
Or worse,

129
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,220
the black hand. The mafia.

130
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,210
The only thing that matters is
what you got inside you, rocco.

131
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,720
Your pride.

132
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,219
When I was a little boy,

133
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,719
I was too small to go
fishing with my father.

134
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
So I hang around the docks, I do all
sorts of little jobs for the fishermen.

135
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,740
They give me oyster shells.

136
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,229
Oysters?
Yeah.

137
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,230
Yeah. In italia, a rich man's
court, a real <i>bocce court, .</i>

138
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,739
Is made of the crushed shell
of the oyster.

139
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,739
That's what makes the ball run
straight like it's supposed to.

140
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
One day,

141
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,760
I bring home
all the shells I save up.

142
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,749
I give them to my father

143
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,750
to make a <i>bocce court
for his own. .</i>

144
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,259
That's how I learn.

145
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
Not just the <i>bocce. .</i>

146
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
How to save.

147
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
The little boy spends, uh?

148
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,780
A man saves.

149
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,770
A man is nothing

150
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,280
without cash.

151
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,779
<i>I, uh, hope you
like the plaque, rocky. .</i>

152
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,280
<i>Oh, yes, it's terrific.</i>

153
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,290
2 boxers facing each other...

154
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,289
I understand the logic, ok?

155
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,789
Oh, uh, there's a car waiting to
take you right to the airport.

156
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,789
That's swell.

157
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,790
I'm sure you'll
find this satisfactory.

158
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,799
Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

159
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,299
$2,000.

160
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,299
Oh, see, here's the thing...

161
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,799
Hey, rocky.
How're you doin'?

162
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,799
I don't take checks.
You got any cash?

163
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,300
Not $2,000.

164
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,809
How much you got?

165
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,820
Uh, I don't know.
About $400, $500.

166
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,809
You've put me in an
embarrassing situation here.

167
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,810
This is fine. This'll do.
Thank you.

168
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,820
But... but... but rocky, uh...

169
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
See, this is a piece of paper.

170

Hey, what the hell's goin' on?

178
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,330
What's goin' on?

179
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,840
Dirty Mick says $5 for
shoveling coal, 7:00 to 4:00,

180
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,339
yeah.

181
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,839
Then he shit-cans us
at 3:45.

182
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
.

183
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,350
You Guinea fuck.

184
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,359
.

185
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Oh!

186
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,859
Knock his lights out.

187
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,870
.

188
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,869
Oh, yes.

189
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,870
How do you like that, mcnutt?

190
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,879
.

191
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,879
Come on, rock. At least a little
extra for the aggravation. Come on.

192
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,380
I ain't no thief, Allie.

193
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,889
Yeah?

194
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,895
And you ain't shovelin' coal
no more, neither.

195
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:27,390
I can't believe you just cost
me another fuckin' job.

196
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,890
What do you wanna do,
make shoes? You bum, you.

197
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,899
Yeah, a bum with an arm.

198
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,910
This cocksucker
he just flattened

199
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,899
once took Jimmy braddock
15 rounds, huh.

200
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Who, this guy?
Yeah.

201
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,409
Hey, wait.
Slow down a second..

202
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,415
Oh my God, <i>paisan,
take it easy. We're here. .</i>

203
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,909
Hiberians hall?
What the hell we doin' here?

204
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,410
Hey, pal, is this where you sign
up for the boxing tournament?

205
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
Yeah, sure.
Fill this out.

206
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,919
Whia, whoa,
slow down. Slow down.

207
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,930
Slow down my ass. You seen what
I did to that bum mcnutt..

208
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,419
You see this, Allie?

209
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
This here right hand's what's
gonna get me out of brockton.

210
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,429
Only heavyweight slot left
is against Henry Lester.

211
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,935
Yeah, sure. Sign me up.

212
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

213
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,429
Henry Lester's
the golden gloves champion.

214
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,930
He's the toughest amateur
in Massachusetts.

215
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,940
You ain't never boxed
for real in your life.

216
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,450
Allie, I wanna fight the guy
everyone's been duckin'.

217
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,439
That way, everybody knows
who's best, right off the bat.

218
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,940
Besides, he's an amateur.
How good could he be?

219
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,950
.

220
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,950
Jesus h. Christ.

221
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,470
Rocco, rocco,
look at the size of this guy.

222
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
One shot.

223
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,469
Introducing in this corner,.

224
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,470
In his first amateur bout,

225
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,479
weighing in at 210 pounds,

226
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,980
fighting out of brockton,
Massachusetts,

227
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,980
rocco "rocky" marchegiano.

228
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
.

229
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,989
Kick his ass, rock.

230
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,989
And in this corner,
weighing in at 230 pounds,

231
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,990
the golden gloves heavyweight
champion for 3 years in row

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,510
- and runner-up in the new england.
-

233
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,499
Henry Lester.

234
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,509
All right, boys.
You know the rules.

235
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,010
I want to see a clean one here.

236
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Touch gloves
and go to your corners.

237
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
.

238
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,520
Rocky's gonna kick his ass.

239
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,020
.

240
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,040
Go, rocco. Come on.

241
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,530
Don't try to punch..

242
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,030
Keep your hands up.

243
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,540
Come on, rock.
Keep your hands up.

244
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Hit him, rocky.
Hit him, rocky.

245
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,539
Come on. Come on.

246
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,040
.

247
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,050
Come on.

248
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,550
Head up.

249
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
.

250
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,570
Get off the rope.

251
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,570
Get out of the corner.

252
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,130
$22.59. Rock,
we gotta get a real job.

253
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,645
I've been thinking, Allie.
It's time for me to turn pro.

254
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:38,639
Pro? Look at yourself.
What are you, nuts?

255
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,639
Oh, you sure don't belong in
a ring with those guys.

256
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,140
Those guys hit like girls.

257
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,149
I just don't train enough.
I'm out of condition.

258
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,155
It says here Joe Louis,
he boxes 30 rounds...

259
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,650
You're comparing
yourself to Joe?

260
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,149
I'm not comparing. If Joe Louis
boxes 30 rounds before a fight,

261
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,150
a guy like me has gotta
fight, what, like 60.

262
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,665
And if he runs 6 Miles,
I better cover 12.

263
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,159
If I train twice as hard as these guys,
maybe I got a shot at winning a fight.

264
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,660
Hey, we're broke. We need a shot
at getting some real jobs. Ok?

265
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,170
Allie, now you
wanna stick around here,

266
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,169
break your back,
then you be my guest.

267
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,169
I've seen what this place
did to my father,

268
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,170
and I'm not gonna
let it happen to me.

269
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,679
Now, I got a shot at gettin'
out of here, all right?

270
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,185
And with my next fight...

271
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:16,180
What next fight?

272
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,679
I'm fightin' again in 3 weeks.

273
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,679
You're fighting again?

274
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,180
Yeah, as a pro.

275
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
There's this big shot manager, Al
weill, coming up to Rhode Island.

276
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,689
He's looking for new talent. Now,
this guy's got 3 champions.

277
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,690
He's lookin' for a heavyweight.

278
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,189
Oh, then you're in.
Look.

279
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,189
I wrote him a letter.
I told him I was undefeated.

280
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,190
Undefeated?
You lost 4 times.

281
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
As an amateur.

282
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,205
But professionally,
I'm undefeated, technically.

283
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,699
Rocco, you don't know
how to box.

284
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,699
So I'll learn.

285
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,699
What are you gonna learn?

286
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,200
They beat my head in, I ain't went down once.
What do I got to lose, Allie?

287
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,209
Allie, Allie, listen to me.

288
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,710
There is no way
that I'm makin' shoes.

289
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,725
Now this is our best shot
at gettin' out of here.

290
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:57,720
Now, if we try our hardest and it
doesn't work, then we go get jobs.

291
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,719
What do you say?

292
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Come on, Allie,
come on, what do you say?

293
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,729
What's the matter with you?

294
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,740
.

295
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,229
More.

296
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,230
All right.

297
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,750
Try to count. Count
them when you do it..

298
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:16,239
One.

299
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
You can only do one?
Come on.

300
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,239
One.

301
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,740
What's the matter with you?

302
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,249
What the hell's the matter with you?
Come on.

303
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,749
No. I can't. What do
you mean you can't?

304
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,750
I can't have bread.

305
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,249
You can't have bread?

306
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,749
I'm in training.
I gotta lose this.

307
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,750
Uncle Matthew's bread...

308
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,259
I never heard of such a thing.
Please.

309
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,770
He can't have bread.

310
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,760
It's very complicated.

311
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,759
Run in the spot. Get your knees up.
Get your knees up.

312
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,260
Get your knees up.
Get your knees up.

313
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,280
Good. Hey, see? When you
listen to me, you do good.

314
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,270
Look, you're off balance.
What are you doing?

315
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,270
Just hold the thing up.
I want to practice the right.

316
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,790
Keep your hands up. What did I tell you?
Keep your hands up.

317
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,279
There we go.
There we go.

318
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
My socks.
Hey, my socks.

319
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,280
There you go. Good.

320
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,289
Good. That looks like...
Hey!

321
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,290
Here you go, have a tomato.

322
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,789
Ma, I can't have tomato.

323
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,789
What do you mean,
you can't have a tomato?

324
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,790
Tomato.

325
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,799
I can't have a tomato.

326
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,299
How can a tomato hurt you?

327
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,805
I gotta eat steak.
It's all right, darling.

328
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:18,299
Have you ever
heard of such thing?

329
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,299
Can a tomato hurt him?
Now, you tell me.

330
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
I told you, it's complex.

331
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,810
Duck.

332
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,810
Ok.

333
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,809
Jab, jab, right.

334
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,810
Good. Jab, jab, right.

335
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,310
Good.

336
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,329
I can't swallow the steak. I
could just swallow the juice.

337
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,340
You can't swallow the steak?

338
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:47,329
I gotta lose weight, ma.

339
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,329
We finally get steak in the
house, he can't eat it.

340
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,330
.

341
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,839
Pa, what do you want from me?

342
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,339
Well, I don't care.

343
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
What is this...
Oh, my God.

344
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,340
<i>Flight 142 from
Houston is now arrmng at gate 2. .</i>

345
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,849
Barbara.

346
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,849
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

347
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,350
LA guardia.

348
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,349
Rocky, what are you
still doin' in New York?

349
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,850
You're supposed to be home last night.
What's goin' on?

350
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
<i>Uh, shit. Yeah, I know,
I should have called, .</i>

351
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,870
But they gave me an award, the <i>paisans
all wanted to talk to me...</i>

352
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,859
<i>What else is new, rocco? .</i>

353
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,859
Do you realize that
you have only been home

354
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,360
one night in the last 6 weeks?

355
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,869
I mean,
when are you gonna stop?

356
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,870
<i>Now. I'm done. .</i>

357
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,869
This is it. Good
to see you, rock..

358
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,370
One more thing. I got this t.V.
Appearance in Chicago.

359
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,885
$4,000 for 5 minutes, and, uh,
uh, that's it, I'm done.

360
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:38,379
But we need you here. We got a
house full of people coming.

361
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,880
Barbara, I ever in a million
years miss her birthday?

362
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,890
Never.

363
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,889
Come on home, rocco.

364
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,890
I baked you a cake.
Mary Anne helped.

365
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,389
Mary Anne?
Is she there? Put her on.

366
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,390
I'll pick you up
at the airport at 4:00.

367
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,399
Ok, here's your daughter.

368
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,905
Oh, is that daddy?
Hm.

369
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,399
Kids, kids,
w-what's goin' on here?

370
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,899
Where are you, daddy?

371
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,399
Hey, truffle.
I'm coming home.

372
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,900
<i>You help mommy with the cake?</i>

373
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,409
I did the icing writing myself.

374
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,420
We're gonna have a great party.
Will you dance with me?

375
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:08,909
Will I dance with you?

376
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,910
When have you ever wanted
to dance with me?

377
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,430
♪

378
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,930

379
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,940
Hey, rock,
aren't you gonna dance?

380
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,960
I'm good, Allie.
Don't worry about me.

381
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,950
All right. Suit yourself.

382
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,969
Sorry.

383
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,470
Marchegiano, watch where
you're diggin' that heel.

384
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,979
I know you?

385

Barbara.

386
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,479
Barbara cousins?

387
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,980
You were 3 years ahead
of me at St. vib's.

388
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,989
Imagine me a foot shorter,
no chest.

389
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh, yeah.

390
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,989
You grew.

So you wanna dance?

394

You always this forward?

395

Right now, to dance.
Dance?

398
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You know,
music, movement, dance.

399
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,509
Yeah, I heard of it.

400
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,009
Uh-huh.

401
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,520
Just I ain't big on footwork.

402
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,009
Come on.

403
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,009
Promise I'll let you lead.

404
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,510
As long as you know
what you're in for.

405
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Will you look at that?
The rock is dancin'.

406
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,520
So, um, what's with
the exercise kick?

407
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,040
Exercise kick?
What are you talkin' about?

408
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,029
Who are you kiddin'?

409
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,030
You look like you sent away to the
comics for that Charles atlas thing.

410
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,040
Well, you don't seem to mind.

411
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,039
You wanna get out of here?

412
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,039
Where do you wanna go?

413
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,540
I don't mean now.
Not yet, anyway.

414
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,055
I mean brockton. You trying
to get out of brockton?

415
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,049
Tell you one thing.
I ain't makin' shoes.

416
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,050
No? What then?

417
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,049
A boxer.

418
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,550
That's a pretty tough racket.
You any good?

419
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,559
Undefeated as a professional.

420
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,059
Yeah?

421
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,559
Yeah. I'm fightin' at the
palisades tomorrow night.

422
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
You wanna come down?

423
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,070
That's kind of far.
Maybe next time.

424
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,075
Ok, I'll tell you what.

425
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:49,569
I'll leave you a ticket at the door
in case you change your mind.

426
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,570
You know what?

427
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,570
What?

428
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,580
We're dancing.

429
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,079
What was that? You looked like you
were dancing with your mother.

430
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
But I won.

431
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,089
Another one of life's
little mysteries.

432
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,589
Hit the asphalt, kid.

433
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,089
You're breathing too much air in here.
How is he, doc?

434
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,589
He's a bleeder.
He'll live?

435
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,589
Oh, he'll be ok.
That's the important thing.

436
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,590
Yeah.

437
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,599
Sure you're ready
for this, rock?

438
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,110
Yeah. Here comes weill. Make like
you know what you're doing.

439
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,599
Nice shoes you got there,
Mr. weill.

440
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Would you listen
to this fucking kid?

441
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,609
He's about to get his head
turned into mashed potatoes

442
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,615
he wants to fuck my florsheims.

443
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,609
Uh, my... my father
makes shoes.

444
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,110
I'm just sayin'
they're nice shoes you got.

445
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,110
Great idea. Something to fall back on.
I understand.

446
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,619
Is he always this cheerful?

447
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,120
This is one of his good days.

448

I, 2, 3...

479

But he's got a right hand
like a fallin' safe.

487
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
I'd sign him immediately.

change my name?

Marciano, huh.

with me, or you wanna sign?

Ok, now, uh, uh,
what... what about Allie?

497
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,349
Charley Goldman's the best trainer
you'll ever meet. Really.

498
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,850
But me and Allie are partners.

499
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,359
I'm already paying a trainer.

500
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,370
You want him, it comes out of your end.
All right?

501
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:36,359
Right.

502
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,359
All right?

503
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,859
Ok, just promise me you won't
tell him I'm paying his way.

504
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,360
Tell him Roosevelt's
paying it, for all I care.

505
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,369
We got a deal?

506
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,380
Yeah. Uh, now this, uh, this
power of attorney. What...

507
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,370
Well, it just means
you give me the go-ahead

508
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,369
to take care of
everything for you.

509
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,370
Investments, tax shelters,
pensions, whatever.

510
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Mmm-hmm. Ok.

511
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,879
Um, now,

512
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,879
this, uh, 50 percent
of... of... of everything?

513
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,380
Yeah, that's the deal. 50 percent.
50 percent of everything.

514
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,395
You know,
fight purses, endorsements.

515
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:07,889
You make $2 sellin' lemonade,
you owe me $1.

516
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,390
.

517
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,390
Um, but that's half, half
of everything I'm earning.

518
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,399
Doesn't that seem
a little steep to you?

519
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,410
Oh, yeah? How much money
you got in your pocket?

520
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:20,399
Uh, uh, I... i guess, well,
about $1.25.

521
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,900
Lucky man.

522
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,410
You wanna see
what 50 percent looks like?

523
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,410
So you wanna get

552

Yeah, work is work.

578
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Like it's been
for the last 20 years.

579
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,560
Maybe someday they... they pay me
to stay home and play <i>bocce. .</i>

580
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,080
Till then,
I got to go to the factory.

581
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,590
Oh, no,
you don't have to do this.

582
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:17,580
I want to, papa.
I want to.

585
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:36,599
Hey, rocco.

586
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,099
The next heavyweight champion
of the fucking world.

587
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
How's it hanging, rock?

588
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,100
To the left.
Always to the left.

589
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,609
How you doin'?

590
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,609
Oh. God! I didn't know the marciano
fan club would be here tonight.

591
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,109
Last year, half of these guys
wouldn't give him the time of day.

592
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,110
Figures.

593
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,619
What do you say? You wanna put
some of your winnings to work?

594
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,625
I got this great idea
for expanding...

595
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:56,619
Now's not the time.

596
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,619
Who's that guy?

597
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,620
That's brockton Eddie.

598
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,119
Looking to borrow something?

599
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
Allie, good to see you.
Yeah. How you doing?

600
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,640
Come on, cut me $5,000 today, I'll
get you back $7,500 in 10 weeks.

601
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:08,129
I don't got that kind of money.

602
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,129
Terrific.
Thanks for saying that.

603
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,129

604
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,630
Who's that little tramp?

605
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,639
Oh, no, that-that... that's Eddie's sister.
She's nuts.

606
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,139
He feels sorry for her,
that's nothing.

607
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,639
.

608
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,140
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
look what's on... oh, rock.

609
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,149
Rock. Rock. Rock.
What?

610
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,149
Look who's on t.V.

611
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,150
Hey, hold it down, everybody.

612
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,149
It's the champ. Turn it up.

613
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,150
<i>...quite a long time. .</i>

614
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,665

00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,160

616

617
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,670

things to do than beat up people. .</i>

618
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,169
<i>Thank you. .</i>

619
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,169
<i>Joe Louis, the greatest boxer

lookin' very good.

623
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,690
Now knock it off the chain.

624
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,690
Rocky. Rocky.

625
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,189
Come here.

626
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,190
I'd like you to meet
Frankie carbo.

627
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,699
Nice to meet you,
Mr. carbo.

628
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,705
Nice to meet you, too, rocky.

629
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,699
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

630
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,699
Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you hear.

631
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,200
So, Mr. carbo, I, uh,
I hear you're the guy

632
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,220
that can make things happen
for me here in New York.

633
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,709
Whoa, rock, settle down.

634
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,209
That's all right.
That's all right.

635
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,710
I like a fighter
who's aggressive.

636
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,719
You think you're ready
to move up in the world?

637
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,730
Well, I'm ready
for the garden, Mr. carbo.

638
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:39,219
You can make book on that.

639
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,220
Well, with Louis retiring, there's
a little room to maneuver.

640
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,229
You know, there's another
Italian fighter,

641
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,735
carmine vingo.
You know him?

642
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,730
Yeah, heard of him.
Big kid, right? 6'4".

643
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,230
Yeah. A lot of people that
I know would like to see

644
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,739
2 undefeated Italian boys
go at it.

645
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,240
Could be a good draw.

646
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,239
I'm telling you, this kid...
This kid's the real thing.

647
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,740
He's ready.

648
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,740
Are you, rocco?

649
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,250
Are you the real thing?

650
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760

651
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760

652
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,270
Mmm-hmm.

653
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,770
Yeah.

654
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,770
Ok.

655
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,770

We got the garden.

656
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,790

657
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,790

658
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,290
Look at him.
I've never seen a kid

659
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,799
sleep like that before a fight.

660
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,805
The rock's about as nervous
as a fire hydrant.

661
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:57,799
Hey, it's time.

662
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,799
All right.

663
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,799
Hey, rocco.

664
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Rocco, come on.

665
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,810
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

666
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,309
Let's go.

667
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,315
Hey, listen to me,
sleeping beauty.

668
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:10,310
This is the garden. Madison square, N.Y.C.
You know what that means?

669
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,310
To lay it all on the line, huh.
Make it happen.

670
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,825
<i>And Madison
square garden is proud .</i>

671
00:36:15,826 --> 00:36:17,819
<i>To have in its audience
tonight .</i>

672
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,319

00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,820
<i>The legendary brown bomber,

674
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,829

Joe Louis is here tonight?

675
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,830
To see me...

676
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,330
<i>...Mr. Joe Louis.</i>

677
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,870
.

678
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,379
Oh, it's bad enough my boss
wouldn't let me go to New York,

679
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,879
but he wouldn't
even let me off early.

680
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,379
I saved a place for you.

681
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,880
Oh, thanks.

682
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,880
.

683
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,890
Let him go.

684
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
.

685
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,910
Get under him.
Get under him.

686
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,919
He's cut.

687
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Break it, boys, break it.
Break it up.

688
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,445
If you're gonna
stick in that crouch,.

689
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:18,439
You better use the uppercut.

690
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,939
This... this eye's a mess.

691
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,439
You gotta make it happen now.

692
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,940
He's bigger
and quicker than you.

693
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,949
You gotta kiss him
with that right hand.

694
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,460
Get out there and
knock this bum out,

695
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,450
and then we'll go home.
Yeah.

696
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,980
1, 2, 3,

697
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,489
4, 5,

698
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:10,489
6, 7, 8...

699
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,989
Go get him, rock.

700
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,490
Take it home.
Take him away.

701
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You all right?

702
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,000
Take it home, rocky.
Take it home.

703
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,040
...3, 4, 5,

704
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:08,060
6, 7, 8, 9... he's out.

705
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,560
.

706
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,069
Get the doctor in here.

707
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,569
Good job, rock.

708
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,080
Kid, you all right?

709
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,590
.

710
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,579
Is he all right?
Is he all right?

711
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,080
Doc, is he all right?

712
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,590
No.

713
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,089
Somebody call an ambulance.

714
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,589
He'll be fine.

715
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,089
Doc, wake him up..

716
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,590
Don't worry about it, rocky.

717
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
.

718
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,599
The storm's held up
the ambulance.

719
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,100
But the hospital's
only 2 blocks away.

720
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,610
.

721
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,610
Over here. Over here.
Come on.

722
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,620
There's a gurney.
Get him on.

723
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,120
1, 2, 3..

724
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,119
Easy. Easy.

725
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,620
Let's go. Let's go.

726
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,629
.

727
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,629
Hey, come on, come on.

728
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,140
.

729
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,639
How is he?

730
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Uh, intensive care.
A 50-50 shot.

731
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,649
Not vingo. Rocky.
Is he all right?

732
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,649
He's right as he's gonna be when
something like this happens.

733
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,150
You better talk to him, make sure
his head is screwed on straight.

734
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,165
I'm not gonna piss away my
time on another Lou ambers.

735
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,659
Yeah, Lou ambers,
lightnin' Lou.

736
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,659
Never got over
killing scarpatti.

737
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,660
But there is one piece
of good news here.

738
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,669
What's that?

739
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,669
Well, the way I figure it,

740
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,680
every day vingo's in a coma,

741
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,169
rocky's price goes up $10,000.

742
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,170
And if vingo
should happen to die,

743
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,180
the sky's the limit.

744
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,680
You know, it's a good thing
we're in a hospital

745
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,690
because this coffee
could kill you.

746
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,189
He had it all ahead of him.

747
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,690
His whole life, and I throw
one hand at his head...

748
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,189
It happens, rock.

749
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,190
You wanna play this game,
you gotta accept that.

750
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,205
And that easily could
have happened to you.

751
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:38,700
Well, maybe I'm not cut out
for it, then.

752
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,699
I mean, even when I win,
I don't win.

753
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
Excuse me.
You rocky marciano?

754
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,209
Yeah. Why,
what happened?

755
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,709
Nothing.

756
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,210
I was just, uh, wondering
if I could get your autograph.

757
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,219
There's a guy's dying
down the hall,

758
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,230
and you want a souvenir,
like I'm babe fuckin' Ruth?

759
00:42:57,231 --> 00:43:00,719
Get the hell out of here.

760
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,720
.

761
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,729
How's vingo doing,
Mr. carbo?

762
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,240
Everything that can be done
is being done for him.

763
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,229
I've seen to it personally.

764
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,729
Wha-what does that mean?
What... what do you mean?

765
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,230
The deathwatch is still on?

766
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,239
Or has... has he still
got a chance? What?

767
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,745
It's too close to call right
now is what it means, kiddo.

768
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:21,739
Look, you're not doing him
or you any good

769
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,240
just sitting here,
watching the kettle.

770
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,755
Go back to brockton.
Get some rest.

771
00:43:26,756 --> 00:43:29,249
You should be
with your family now.

772
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,749
No. I gotta stay here
till I know.

773
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,250
Listen to Mr. carbo, rock.

774
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,260
You ain't doing
nothin' just sittin' here.

775
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,760
Look, rocco,
a terrible thing happened.

776
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,780
I know your heart is heavy,
but it was an accident.

777
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,270
You gotta remember that,
an accident.

778
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,269
Yeah. Thanks, Mr. carbo.

779
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,269
And no matter what,

780
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,770
just remember,
you're not a murderer.

781
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,290
You gotta let it go or it'll ruin you.
You get me?

782
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Yeah.

783
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,790
So go home, huh?

784
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,310
.

785
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,300
Hang on a second, Al.

786
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,310
<i>Scusi, signora vingo? .</i>

787
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,310
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

788
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,840
I hate that sign.

789
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,360
Thank you.

790
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,350
.

791
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,360
You heard.

792
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,359
You don't call me, but I heard.

793
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,859
This vingo boy.
He's Italian?

794
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,359
Mmm-hmm.

795
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,860
<i>Éwith a family? .</i>

796
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,870
Yeah, a wife.

797
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,880
<i>Holy heaven. .</i>

798
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,870
Every time you fight,
I go to church,

799
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,879
and I pray you don't get hurt

800
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,885
and you don't hurt nobody else.

801
00:45:37,886 --> 00:45:39,379
And now look what happens.

802
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,879
Ma, don't get started, please.

803
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,880
I did not raise a murderer..

804
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:43,890
Enough, ma.

805
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,410
Well, that could've
gone better.

806
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,960
Maybe I ought to find
another racket.

807
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,449
Doin' what, makin' shoes?

808
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,450
I'll talk to Mr. carbo.
He likes me.

809
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,959
He'll set me up with something.

810
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,470
Yeah, he likes you
when you're boxing,

811
00:46:56,471 --> 00:46:58,459
same as everyone else
that hangs on to you.

812
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,959
Like you?

813
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,460
Yeah, like me.

814
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,469
I'm sorry.

815
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,969
Come on, rocco..

816
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,980
Ever since we met,
all you've been telling me

817
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:10,969
is how you wanna
get out of brockton.

818
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,469
You have been given a gift.

819
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,970
Now you're gonna throw it away?

820
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,979
I'm not a boxer.

821
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,985
I'm a guy with a good punch
who got lucky.

822
00:47:16,986 --> 00:47:19,479
You're 25 and 0 against the
best boxers in the world.

823
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,979
Would Louis act this way?

824
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,479
Louis never had to...

825
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,480
He punched natie brown straight
into the hospital in '36.

826
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,989
Brown never fights again.

827
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,495
4 months later, Louis k.O.'S
braddock for the title.

828
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:31,990
If Louis had given up, he'd be
sweeping floors right now.

829
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,510
Marry me.

830
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,499
No.

831
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,499
Look, vingo knew what he
was risking when he...

832
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Barbara, did you hear what I said?
I asked if you would marry me.

833
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,020
How can I say yes with all that's
going on in your head now?

834
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:50,009
You're killing me here, I swear to God.
You don't love me?

835
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:53,010
Of course I love you.
How can you ask me that?

836
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,520
Even if I stop boxing?

837
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,520
Even if you make shoes.

838
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,540
<i>Good evening. .</i>

839
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:09,029
Hey, pop.

840
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:10,530
Hey, what are you doing here?

841
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,030
If it is to bring me my lunch,

842
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,039
I... i say you better
fix your watch.

843
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,545
Hey, listen, pop, I'm a little
tired from running around.

844
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:20,039
You mind if we sit down
for a second?

845
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,040
Uh, the vingo boy,
how... how's he doing?

846
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,549
Well, he's out of the hospital.

847
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,555
Looks like he's gonna be okay.

848
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:29,549
<i>Va bene. And you?
What are you gonna do? .</i>

849
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,049
You gonna go on fightin'?
Because I want you to know,

850
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,050
if you don't want to
it's ok by me.

851
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,059
Well, one good thing
that came out of this mess

852
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,065
is my price is going
through the roof.

853
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:41,560
It looks like after my next fight,
I might get my title shot...

854
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,060
Which means I'll be able
to pay off the house

855
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,580
and pull you out of this
damn factory for good.

856
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:49,069
Rocco, you don't
have to do that.

857
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,069
I mean, me, your mama, the
family, we're ok, really.

858
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,070
I want to, pop.

859
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,580
More than anything.

860
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,080
.

861
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,090
Hit him already.
Hit him.

862
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,099
What the hell's he doing?

863
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,110
I don't know.

864
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,099
Somebody ought to check
his cup for balls.

865
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,599
Go to the right..

866
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,100
What's wrong with him?

867
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,109
Vingo. He's not over
vingo yet.

868
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:27,120
Where's that right?

869
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,610
What is this, huh?

870
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,110
.

871
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,119
Wake up!

872
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,119
You're prancing around like
you're taking in the shorts.

873
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,119
What's wrong with you?

874
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,119
I feel a little tight today.

875
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,620
You're playing games.
Where's that right hand?

876
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,129
How am I doing on points?
Points?

877
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,640
Your whole career you were
never ahead on points.

878
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:49,129
Knock him out!

879
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,129
Hey, what kind of crap is this?

880
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,130
You're making me look
like a schmuck out there.

881
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,139
I'm the guy getting
his mug beaten about.

882
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,645
One of you step in and earn
the money for a change.

883
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,639
We're just trying to help
you here, all right?

884
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
You're 2 rounds away
from making penny loafers.

885
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,140
.

886
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,160
Maybe he'll get mad now.

887
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,650
Hit him. Come on.
Come on.

888
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,670
2, 3,

889
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,160
4, 5,

890
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,660
6,

891
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,670
you all right?

892
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,679
What the hell are you doing?

893
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Come on, rocco.
Pull it together.

894
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,679
Come on, rocco.
Now's the time.

895
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,180
Come on, do it.

896
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,190
Throw the right.

897
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,689
We got trouble.

898
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,690
What're you doin', rocky?

899
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,199
Hey, hey, hey, whoa.
Watch your hands.

900
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,200
What? You couldn't
do that to lastarza?

901
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,715
Look, I don't care
what you think.

902
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,209
All he did was run, ok?

903
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,210
You forced the action.
You deserved the decision.

904
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,709
Bullshit.

905
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,210
A win is a win, rocco.

906
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,730
I stunk up the place,
didn't I, Charlie?

907
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:18,720
I seen you do better.

908
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,219
What the matter with you?

909
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,220
Where's that punch
they all paid to see?

910
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,729
Al, I don't know what to tell you.
I'm sorry.

911
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,240
I don't know
what happened out there.

912
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,730
You're lucky
the judges like you.

913
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,240
What does that mean?

914
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,739
You rigged the cards?

915
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,239
No, rocco, there was no fix.

916
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,240
But you candy-ass around the ring like
that again, there may have to be.

917
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,249
Now, you straighten up
and fly right.

918
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,750
Otherwise I'll drop you
like a bad habit.

919
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,709
Was.

920
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,710
Was?

921
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,209
Hey, Al!
Good to see you!

922
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,209
Good to see you too, yeah.

923
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,710
What do you mean, was?

924
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,725
I don't know how many
notches he dropped tonight.

925
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:26,219
He's ready
for the title shot right now.

926
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,219
Your boy's got a little wait
in front of him now.

927
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,720
Rocco, you can't
knock out everybody.

928
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,229
But I had him, pop.
I had him.

929
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,729
How you doin'?
Hey, good to see you..

930
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,230
How are you, man?
Thank you very much.

931
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,739
Good to see you.

932
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,739
.

933
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,240
Drinks for the house!

934
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,740
Pop. Pop, you see who that is?

935
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,250
Hey, rock. He's gonna come over.
Check it out.

936
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,759
Shh, Allie, shut up!
Just talk.

937
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,265
Act like you've been there
before, know what I mean?

938
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,259
Pop, look at the shoes
on this guy.

939
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,760
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, champ.

940
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,260
How you doing, huh?

941
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,270
I'm doing great.
How you doing?

942
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,769
Good. Good.

943
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,780
So I finally get to meet
the great white hope.

944
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,769
Mr. Louis.
What a pleasure.

945
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,770
I've been waiting
my whole life to meet you.

946
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,279
Really?
You need to get out more.

947
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,779
.

948
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,779
Now, I've known Charlie for years, but
who are the rest of these folks?

949
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,279
This here's my father, pierino.

950
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,280
Nice to know you, sir.

951
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,789
A pleasure. Thank you..

952
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,795
This is my corner man,
Allie colombo.

953
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,789
How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

954
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,290
And this is my, um...

955
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,789
I guess you'd call her...

956
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,790
Fiancee, Barbara.
My...

957
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,299
Oh, really? Is that so?

958
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,310
Yeah.

959
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,299
.

960
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,800
Seems I'm gettin' married,
Mr. Louis.

961
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,299
You take care of this man.

962
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,800
Oh, I will. I will.

963
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,309
From what I'm hearin',
he's the next dempsey.

964
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,309
He's better than dempsey.

965
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,810
He's better than you.

966
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,325
I'm sorry, Joe, but sometimes
my friend Allie here

967
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,819
likes to make jokes when maybe
he should shut his mouth.

968
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,319
It's ok.

969
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,820
Well, it was nice meetin' you folks.
Congratulations.

970
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,329
Thank you, Joe.
Thank you.

971
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,329
Charlie.

972
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,329
What are you, stupid?
That's the brown bomber!

973
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,330
Hey, hey, what's the matter
with you?

974
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,339
Dear God,
what are you doing to me?

975
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,350
Shh, did you see his face?

976
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:24,339
I saw his face.

977
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,839
Look at him.
Hey, hey.

978
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,339
In his eyes, he knew the truth, rock.
He knew.

979
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,340
Just sit down.
You had too much to drink.

980
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,350
Just sit down. I can't believe
you'd do this again to me.

981
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,349
Don't do this to me.

982
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,349
<i>I tell you, though.
I can't sing, I can't dance. .</i>

983
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,849
<i>But just to show
that I'm gracious, .</i>

984
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,850
<i>I'll take on any guy
in the house.</i>

985
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,359
<i>.</i>

986
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,365
<i>They're great.
Thanks a lot. Thank you. .</i>

987
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:44,859
He's killing them.

988
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,359
I can't get enough of this guy.

989
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,859
Call the boys in Vegas.

990
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,860
Tell them we got the guy
for their opening.

991
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,380
Oh, you were great, champ.

992
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,369
Thanks a lot, thanks.
Is my car ready?

993
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,869
Actually, I made us some
reservations at the pump room.

994
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,369
I got a business
proposition for you.

995
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,370
Hey, that's real swell of you,
but I got to get home.

996
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,890
I got my whole family waitin' on me.
You got my, uh...

997
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:05,879
Terrific.

998
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,879
$4,000. In cash,
like you requested.

999
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,880
Uh, no offense. It's not that
I don't trust you, but...

1000
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,395
No, no, it's all there. Listen,
I know you're in a rush,

1001
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:16,389
but, uh, I got
a few friends in Vegas.

1002
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,889
They're in a little bit
of a bind.

1003
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,389
I'm sorry to hear that.

1004
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,390
They need somebody for their
casino opening tonight.

1005
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,399
There'd be a fee, of course.

1006
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,399
To tell you, pal, I'd love to,
but I swore to my wife...

1007
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,900
$25,000.

1008
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Cash?

1009
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,909
Allie? Why don't you
take care of this one.

1010
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:33,909
Again?

1011
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,910
Allie, take care of this.

1012
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:40,910
Say, Allie, look at that little
guy at the end of the counter.

1013
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,419
Who, the busboy?

1014
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,419
That ain't no busboy.
That's lightnin' Lou ambers.

1015
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,919
The ex-lightweight
champion?

1016
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,419
Yeah.
Come on.

1017
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,920
Hey, you boys done?

1018
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,929
Yeah, say, Mac, your name
lightning Lou ambers?

1019
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,935
Who wants to...
Hey, you're rocky marciano!

1020
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,429
Lou ambers.
Good to meet you.

1021
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,430
Good to meet you, too.
Yeah.

1022
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,930
Yeah.

1023
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,439
This is my buddy,
Allie colombo.

1024
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,439
Hey, how's it going?

1025
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,445
Good. I remember you
from when we were kids.

1026
00:56:04,446 --> 00:56:07,439
Swell, swell, real swell.
How's it going, champ?

1027
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,940
Never better.
Never better.

1028
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
Terrific.

1029
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,950
You mind me askin'
what you're doin' here?

1030
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,950
What, here?
It ain't so bad.

1031
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,959
Pays the bills,
get to meet some good people.

1032
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,459
Sure. Sure.

1033
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,959
Al weill used to manage you,
right?

1034
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,459
Well, let's just say I paid
for his house and 3 cars.

1035
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,960
So he handled your money?

1036
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,469
Oh, he handled it all right.

1037
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,969
Didn't do such a good job, huh?

1038
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,469
Oh, it wasn't his fault.

1039
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:40,470
I was going through dough
like Hitler through Poland.

1040
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,980
You know how it is. You... you... you
sign a deal when you're young,

1041
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,479
it ends up chasin' you around
the rest of your life, huh?

1042
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,479
You-you're tellin' me you've got
nothin' left from bein' champ?

1043
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,989
I got memories, kid.
A lot of great memories.

1044
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:57,490
And a case of the clap I can't
get rid of for the life of me.

1045
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'll see you.

1046
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Take it easy.

1047
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,500
It ain't right, Allie.

1048
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,499
Guy like that fights
all those years,

1049
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,499
he's got nothin'
to show for it?

1050
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,000
What do you got?
Come on, pony up.

1051
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,509
That's what I got.

1052
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,009
I'll give it to him.

1053
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:19,010
Say, Lou. It ain't much, but it's all we got.
Throw that in your kick.

1054
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,019
You snotty little wops.

1055
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,019
Oh.

1056
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,020
I was lightweight champion
of the world, 1936!

1057
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,529
Where the fuck do you get off?

1058
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,029
Lou, I don't mean
to insult you...

1059
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,030
I fuckin' work for a lmng!

1060
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,530
I don't need your charity.
Get the hell out of here!

1061
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,529
I'm sorry if we offended you...

1062
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,030
I'm Lou ambers,

1063
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,039
lightweight champion
of the world!

1064
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,539
I'm not a charity case,
you bums!

1065
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,040
I'm Lou fucking ambers!

1066
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,060
You know, I ain't surprised..

1067
00:57:54,061 --> 00:57:56,049
Ambers was always
a little proud.

1068
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,549
Punchy but proud.

1069
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,549
I just can't believe
an ex-champ winds up

1070
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,050
slingin' hash.
It's degrading.

1071
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,059
Yeah? I got news
for you.

1072
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,570
Worse can happen.

1073
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,069
Say, this can't be.

1074
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,069
Now, we saw him
just the other night.

1075
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,569
He... he was buying drinks
and everything.

1076
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,069
It seems the bomber
got himself into a corner

1077
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,070
he can't box out of.

1078
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,590
Says here he's into the I.R.S.
For a cool million!

1079
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:27,579
Not counting the $500,000
that he's defaulted on loans,

1080
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,080
$200,000 in alimony to his ex.

1081
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,089
It's a long list.

1082
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,595
This don't make sense.

1083
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:35,089
He was champ for a dozen years.

1084
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,089
He was fightin' for the big
paydays since the 30's.

1085
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,590
Not to mention all the
businesses and advertisements.

1086
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,599
Yeah. Millions of dollars
and no sense.

1087
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
Hey, Freddy! Try this on!

1088
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,600
I got the other papers
right in front of me, right.

1089
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,109
I'm gonna take a look.

1090
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,109
I want my money.

1091
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,109
What are you going on about?

1092
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,610
I'll call you back.

1093
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,610
My half. The half you've been
investing for me. I want it.

1094
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,110
What, do you need some
walking-around money? $50, $100?

1095
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,625
I'm not talkin'
about chump change.

1096
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:05,119
I'm talkin' about my half.

1097
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,619
What's going on, Allie?

1098
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,119
The man wants his money, Al.

1099
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,119
Show me my file.

1100
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,620
Your file?

1101
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,130
There ain't no file.
It's all up here.

1102
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,629
Hey, I got to answer to you, you
ungrateful son of a bitch?

1103
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,129
It's the other way around, pal!

1104
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,129
I signed you when
no one would touch you!

1105
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,630
I want my money, God damn it!

1106
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,140
Easy now, easy.

1107
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,139
It ain't all in one place,
you know.

1108
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,139
I got it spread around
in investments.

1109
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,140
Like what?

1110
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,655
Well, we got $60,000 in an
apartment building in the Bronx.

1111
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:37,649
I trusted you with my money
and you put it in the Bronx?

1112
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,649
Hey, come on, you knew we were
investing in real estate.

1113
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:42,150
Don't act so innocent.

1114
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,159
I want out.

1115
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,659
Well, you can't get out.

1116
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,159
We used the apartments
as collateral

1117
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,660
for the parking lots
in Syracuse.

1118
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,659
Syracuse?

1119
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,160
Which are tied into development
properties in Florida,

1120
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,669
overseen by the partnership
in Maine.

1121
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,680
Oh, skip the birdseed, weill!
What am I worth in cash?

1122
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,669
Well, things didn't pan out
exactly as I'd hoped.

1123
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,670
Just give me a few months,
I got a couple of...

1124
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,179
Cash me out! I'll handle my
own finances from now on.

1125
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,679
You? What do you know
about money?

1126
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,680
I know what I don't got!

1127
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,179
All right, fine.
You want it, you got it.

1128
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,680
I still get half of everything you
make for the rest of your life.

1129
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,195
Yeah, yeah,
don't worry about it!

1130
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:15,689
Just worry about my title shot.

1131
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,690
Did you even call up
ezzard Charles' people yet?

1132
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,690
Title shot? You fought lastarza
like you were wearing a skirt!

1133
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,199
He won that fight, all right?

1134
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,205
Well, tell that
to your friend, carbo!

1135
01:00:24,206 --> 01:00:26,699
He's the one pullin'
the strings, right?

1136
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,699
And I'll tell you
one thing, though.

1137
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,700
We're lucky if they even call
us before November, December.

1138
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,709
I'm not fightin'
till the end of the year?

1139
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,709
That's right.

1140
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,710
Oh, no, Al.
No, no, no, no, no.

1141
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,219
Set me up with a... with an exhibition
or some... call those wrestling people.

1142
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,719
Wrestling? What's the matter with you?
Are you outta your mind?

1143
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,720
It's like stepping over
dollars to pick up a dime.

1144
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,239
.

1145
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,240
Crooked again.

1146
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,749
You know why the ball
goes crooked?

1147
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,755
'Cause you don't got
those oyster shells

1148
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,249
to make it roll straight,
right?

1149
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,749
How you know that?

1150
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,250
You told me
when I was little, pop.

1151
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,260
.

1152
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,760
Listen, pop, I gotta talk
to you about something.

1153
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:29,759
Sure.
What's on your mind, rocco?

1154
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,260
Well, it turns out I don't have
as much money saved as I thought

1155
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:36,280
and I didn't clear what I expected
from the lastarza fight.

1156
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:37,270
What's wrong?

1157
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,790
I just don't think you ought to give
notice at the factory just yet.

1158
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:47,779
And, uh, as far as
payin' off the house,

1159
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,280
maybe we ought to hold off
on that as well.

1160
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,789
It's just temporary,
you understand,

1161
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:57,789
but I'm makin' some investments
and tryin' some things out.

1162
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:01,290
With the money I got right
now, I... i don't...

1163
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,300
It's ok, rocco.
I understand.

1164
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,799
Do you, pop?

1165
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,300
Sure. Sure.

1166
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,810
Thanks, pop.

1167
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,329
Well, you know, I never would
have asked you, right?

1168
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,840
But those Brooks brothers jerks
down at every bank downtown.

1169
01:02:35,841 --> 01:02:38,329
They say I don't have the
collateral for a loan that size.

1170
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,330
So I says to them, "if I had
the fucking collateral,

1171
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,339
I wouldn't need
the fuckin' loan."

1172
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,350
It's tough doin' business
with people you don't know.

1173
01:02:44,351 --> 01:02:46,339
Which is why
I'm gonna help you out.

1174
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,339
No shit? You'll do it?

1175
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,840
Yeah, but let me make it clear.
This isn't a loan.

1176
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,349
I'm investing in your business.

1177
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,355
Hey, all I want
is $5,000, rock.

1178
01:02:54,356 --> 01:02:55,849
You get $7,500
back in 10 weeks.

1179
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:57,349
And 5 percent of the take.

1180
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,350
And you won't be sorry.
It's gonna be real classy.

1181
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:02,350
Like, I-I'm gonna add another dining
room and expand the kitchen.

1182
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,870
I got my eye
on this chef from Boston...

1183
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,859
Eddie, my father eats here
for free.

1184
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,859
Sure, rock.
Where do I sign?

1185
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,360
We don't sign.

1186
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,870
The minute I put anything
down on paper,

1187
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,380
my thieving manager comes
around for his 50 percent.

1188
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:16,869
This is between you and me.

1189
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:18,870
It's between you and me.

1190
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,380
Give me a cup of coffee.

1191
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,380
.

1192
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,380
Hello.

1193
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,389
<i>Hi, Barb? .</i>

1194
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,389
Hey. Where are you?

1195
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,395
I'm in Chicago.

1196
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:35,890
All right, rocky!

1197
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,389
<i>What are you still doin' there? I
thought you were comin' home. .</i>

1198
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:41,390
Uh, yeah, I know what I said, but
I... i gotta go to Vegas first.

1199
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,910
<i>I'll be home in plenty
of time for tomorrow. .</i>

1200
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:47,899
Come on, baby. You know how
much this means to me.

1201
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,400
Barb, this is
the last time ever, I promise.

1202
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,909
This is the big one.

1203
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:56,420
<i>$25,000, cash. That's enough
to put us where we wanna be.</i>

1204
01:03:56,421 --> 01:03:58,909
I just want us to be together.

1205
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,410
We will be.

Louis' statement to the press .</i>

1207
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,930
<i>Prior to his hospitalization
in Denver. .</i>

1208
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,419
<i>I never did
nothin' to nobody. .</i>

1209
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,420
Um, Barbara, I'm late.
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

1210
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,929
<i>So I didn't understand .</i>

1211
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,930
<i>Why all these tricks was
bein' played on me. .</i>

1212
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,939
<i>I'm bein' locked up here .</i>

1213
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,450
<i>For reasons
other than you think. .</i>

1214
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,440
<i>I just want
certain people to know .</i>

1215
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,460
<i>That they're
the real ones who need help. .</i>

1216
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,450
<i>Another fighter
pays the steep price, life...</i>

1217
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,960
So, you hear about Louis?

1218
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,459
Oh, yeah, it's a shame.
He's a hell of a guy.

1219
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,460
Yeah.

1220
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,475
I can't believe a guy like that
winds up in some loony bin.

1221
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:57,469
You know, after everything he did for
the government during the war,

1222
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:01,470
then they gotta turn around and
take every last penny he's got?

1223
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,979
I'll tell you, rock.

1224
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,990
You were smart to get out
of it when you did.

1225
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Did we pass Denver yet?

1226
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,000
Congratulations, rock!

1227
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,489
Go, Barbara!

1228
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,990
Hey, rocky!
Only one piece, right?

1229
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,505
I'm surprised he doesn't want
50 percent of the cake, too.

1230
01:05:24,506 --> 01:05:27,999
Yeah. They gotta make a new
class for me, Al. Overweight.

1231
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:39,010
I'd like to propose
a toast to the newlyweds!

1232
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,530
May your love last
from bell to bell.

1233
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,020
<i>To life!</i>

1234
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,020
.

1235
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,530
Drink, drink, drink.

1236
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,529
Uh, rocky,.

1237
01:05:56,530 --> 01:06:00,530
Rocky, you, uh, you got yourself
a beautiful bride there.

1238
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,540
And Barbara. What can I say?

1239
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,039
You'd have been
better off buyin' a dog.

1240
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,040
.

1241
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,549
No, no, no,
seriously, though, Barbara,

1242
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:17,049
I would like
to officially welcome you

1243
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:20,049
as the newest cornerman
in the marciano camp.

1244
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:24,060
As we slug our way to the
heavyweight title of the world!

1245
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,559
Rocky, you're gonna do it!

1246
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,060
Oh, and, uh,
while we're on the subject,

1247
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,575
I would like
to tell everybody here

1248
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:38,069
that just a few moments ago,
I received a phone call

1249
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:42,070
formalizing rocky marciano's
next bout.

1250
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:46,090
All right. 3 months from tonight,
in Madison square garden,

1251
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,580
the brockton blockbuster
will face

1252
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,090
none other than the legendary
brown bomber, Joe Louis!

1253
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,090
Go get him, rocco..

1254
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,105
How could you
do this to me, Al?

1255
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:06,099
Look, look. Louis
retired with the belt.

1256
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,099
The second he unretired, they made
him the number one contender.

1257
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,600
This is an opportunity
you cannot pass up.

1258
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,610
No, listen, walcott, Charles.
Anybody but Louis!

1259
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,609
Fighting Louis is the only way

1260
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:17,609
you'll get them to forget
about the lastarza mess.

1261
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:18,609
I beat lastarza!

1262
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,109
You want a shot at the title?
Yeah.

1263
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,110
Fine. Beat Louis.

1264
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,630
Beat Louis? I'm not even
gonna fight Louis.

1265
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:26,620
Listen, you ungrateful punk,

1266
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:31,120
this is not about you,
what you want.

1267
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:35,140
I've got a lot invested in you
and it's time I got paid.

1268
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:38,629
You don't wanna fight Louis?
Fine..

1269
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:42,130
You go down there and you tell your
family you're finished with boxing

1270
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,139
and you're movin' back home.

1271
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:48,139
Maybe you can take your old
man's job at the shoe factory.

1272
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,140
.

1273
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,150
Beautiful wedding,
Mrs. marchegiano.

1274
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,660
<i>Complimenti. .</i>

1275
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,660
What's goin' on, huh?

1276
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,159
I don't know how much clearer I could be.
I gotta start trainin' now.

1277
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,660
Yeah, but the fight's not for 3
months, and we just got married.

1278
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:16,675
Most people who just got married
go on a goddamn honeymoon!

1279
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:19,170
Yeah, well, most people
don't have to fight Joe Louis!

1280
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:38,190
Pop, I gotta go to the camp.

1281
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:41,190
Sit with me for a moment, huh?

1282
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,200
I gotta go.
I gotta leave.

1283
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,200
It's for you.

1284
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,210
I gotta go.

1285
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,720
.

1286
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,235
Well, now, me and the others are
stayin' here in the main house.

1287
01:09:14,236 --> 01:09:16,229
See the cottage over there?
That's for you.

1288
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:20,229
I want you should have your rest, you know.
Your privacy. Whatever.

1289
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:23,230
And, um, that's your, uh,
gym equipment over here.

1290
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,745
Look, regulation ring.
The works.

1291
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,239
Yeah, and you got the prince
of wales comin' up to spar.

1292
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,239
How much of this is
comin' out of my end?

1293
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,740
Nothin'. Carbo made a deal
with the owners.

1294
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,755
What, he agreed not to bump 'em
off if they packed up and left?

1295
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,750
I still wanna see
all the bills.

1296
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,270
This is the only
time Louis got knocked out..

1297
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,259
See how he drops his left?

1298
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:54,269
Look how he leaves himself wide
open for the overhand right.

1299
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,770
You try to outbox Louis,
he'll tear your head off.

1300
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,270
You gotta stay low and close.

1301
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,790
Never let him catch you
in the center of the ring.

1302
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,779
You let him stay a foot and a
half away, he'll murder you.

1303
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,780
And when that opening
finally comes,

1304
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:16,800
you gotta throw that right
hand with everything you got.

1305
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,800
That's enough, Allie.

1306
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,800
No, Allie.
Let it run.

1307
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,800
I want to see this one, too.

1308
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,809
This don't mean nothin'.
It was a 1,000 years ago.

1309
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,310
Oh, yeah..

1310
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,819
He's still the best boxer
that ever lived.

1311
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:49,320
You give him half a chance, he'll carve
you up like a thanksgmn' bird.

1312
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,330
Goodnight, Irene.

1313
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,340
Give me another mile.
One more mile..

1314
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,340
Time, time. Time!

1315
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,849
Hey, where you goin'?

1316
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,349
That's it.
I'm done for the day, man.

1317
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,850
2 more. Come on.
2 more. 2 more.

1318
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:22,350
Take a break, rock. Cool down.
You've already got 10 rounds.

1319
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,360
You. In!

1320
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,859
Good, good, good, good, good.

1321
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,360
Now! Come on!

1322
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:40,370
What's wrong with you? You ain't
said nothing in 12 Miles.

1323
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,879
That son of a bitch,
brockton Eddie.

1324
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,379
What about him?

1325
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,879
He's into me deep and I ain't
seen a dime in months.

1326
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,879
Put it out of your head. Ain't
nothing you can do about it now.

1327
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:50,880
Yeah, but you can.

1328
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,889
What are you
talking about, rock?

1329
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:54,395
I want you to go home
to brockton.

1330
01:11:54,396 --> 01:11:55,890
I want you to get me my money.

1331
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:57,390
What are you talking about,
rocco?

1332
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,889
I'm helping you get ready
for a fight here.

1333
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,390
Best thing you can do to help me
is to go home and get my money.

1334
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,910
Why are you talkin' to me like that?
Get me my money!

1335
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,400
Rock. Hey, rocco.

1336
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,910
Charlie says
you're lookin' good, kid.

1337
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,430
So you gonna take him?

1338
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,930
Hey, rocco.

1339
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:35,940
Take a break.
I'm talkin' to you.

1340
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,430
.

1341
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,940
So that's how
it's gonna be, huh, kid?

1342
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,960
Hi. I'm rocky marciano,

1343
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,475
and I'm here at my greenwood
lake training camp

1344
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:17,970
preparing for my upcoming bout
with the great Joe Louis

1345
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:21,970
on October 23
at Madison square garden.

1346
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,485
I sure hope you all come down
and see the fight.

1347
01:13:24,486 --> 01:13:26,479
I know you won't be
disappointed if you do.

1348
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,479
Hey, rocky, you really
think you can beat Louis?

1349
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,980
Well, I'll certainly
try my hardest.

1350
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,000
Cut.

1351
01:13:35,001 --> 01:13:36,990
.

1352
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,489
Thanks, rocky.
That was great.

1353
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:42,490
Yeah. It's great
to meet you, too.

1354
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,510
Hey, uh, do you think I could get
your autograph? It's for my kid.

1355
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,500
Did you get the money?

1356
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,500
I tried, rocco. I get to town,
that jerk-off, Eddie...

1357
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,009
Did you get the money?

1358
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,509
No. I don't know
what to tell you.

1359
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:56,510
Tell me? Tell him I want the money.
I'm supposed to get...

1360
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:59,509
Excuse me, Mr... Mr. marciano.
Uh, we're leavin' now.

1361
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,010
Okay, great,
it's nice to meet you.

1362
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,019
Hey, good luck in the fight.

1363
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,030
Thanks a lot. I'm supposed to
get 5 percent of his action.

1364
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:09,019
Personally, I can't wait to see you
go out and kill that big <i>moolie. .</i>

1365
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,020
You wanna excuse us
for a second?

1366
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,535
What'd you say? No, wait, I wanna hear this.
What should I do to this guy?

1367
01:14:14,536 --> 01:14:17,029
I'm just sayin', if you
can do half the damage

1368
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:19,530
to that nigger
that you did to vingo...

1369
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,030
You wanna see me hurt someone?

1370
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,039
Rocco, rocco.

1371
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,539
You wanna see me kill someone?

1372
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,550
Rocco! Take it easy!

1373
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,040
Rocco, rocco.
My car, man!

1374
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,539
What are you doin'?

1375
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,040
Look what you did.
Get out of here! Go!

1376
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:38,049
Maybe we should've booked him
to fight Louis' Cadillac.

1377
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,550
Look, see, now it's stuck.
What is he...

1378
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,570
Heard you almost went the
distance with a car.

1379
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,570
What are you doin' here?

1380
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,080
I'm sorry.

1381
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,580
I miss you so much.

1382
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:16,600
All they're talkin' about back
home is you fightin' Louis.

1383
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:19,089
You know, I like the guy
I'm fightin' against

1384
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:21,090
more than the guys
I'm fightin' for.

1385
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,599
You know, it's guys like carbo
give us all a bad name.

1386
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,110
They think Italians
are all gangsters.

1387
01:15:25,111 --> 01:15:28,099
They forget about men
like my father, you know.

1388
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,599
Anyone can handle it,
it's you, rock.

1389
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,609
I gotta beat this guy. I got... i got
so many people countin' on me.

1390
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:37,610
You'll find a way to win.
You always do.

1391
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:43,610
Well, if I lose this Friday, I'm
not gonna have anything left.

1392
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,120
You'll still have me.

1393
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,130
I love you, Barbara.

1394
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,630
I love you so much.

1395
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,150
.

1396
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:18,650
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

1397
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,159
Excuse me.

1398
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,170
Yes.

1399
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,659
I need to see Joe Louis.

1400
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,659
No visitors
but immediate family.

1401
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:34,669
He'll wanna see me.
I'm rocky marciano.

1402
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:36,669
<i>Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen. .</i>

1410
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,689
Oh, <i>mio dio,
just turn it on, huh? .</i>

1411
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:02,190
No! I don't want
to listen to it!

1412
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,710
Fine. Drive yourself crazy.
You know where I will be.

1413
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:35,730
.

1414
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,250
Come on, rock. It's time.

1415
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,260
Hey, Allie.

1416
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,770
Yeah.

1417

way from the streets of brockton .</i>

1424

<i>There've been stories,
rumors really, .</i>

1427
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,320
<i>That rocky's dangerous manager Al
weill set up this fight for him .</i>

1428
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,329
<i>The minute Louis
came out of retirement. .</i>

1429
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,840
<i>One can only admire
the young man's ambition.</i>

.

1466
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:16,015
<i>It looks like rocky's plan is to
try and stay inside on Louis. .</i>

1467
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:19,009
<i>Jack sharkey tried that in '36
and he didn't last 3 rounds. .</i>

1468
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:20,509
Oh, come on, baby.

1469
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:22,010
Break it up..

1470
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,030
All right, boys, break it up!
Let go!

1471
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,040
Get off the rope!
Get off the rope!

1472
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,070
Attaboy, rocco!
Come on, kiddo!

1473
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:21,069
.

1474
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,570
<i>And there's the relentless
marciano we expected! .</i>

1475
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:26,090
<i>The man that ended
carmine vingo's career. .</i>

1476
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,080
All right!

1477
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,079
.

1478
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,080
Goddamn.
Kid came to fight.

1479
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:38,095
You just went 3 minutes with the
greatest boxer who ever lived.

1480
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,089
How does it feel?

1481
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:41,089
Like I got hit by a truck.

1482
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:43,090
He's so fast, I can't see half
of his punches comin', Charlie.

1483
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,610
Well, you know what the cure
for that is, don't you?

1484
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:48,099
Hit him before he hits you!

1485
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,599
<i>Here we go with round 2. .</i>

1486
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,600
<i>So far, it's anybody's fight.</i>

1487
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:45,170
<i>He's in here.</i>

1488
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:35,720
.

1489
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,739
<i>According to
my unofficial scorecard, .</i>

1490
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,745
<i>After 6 rounds,
Louis is slightly ahead. .</i>

1491
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,239
<i>But as the rounds mount up, .</i>

1492
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,239
<i>Marciano seems
to be getting stronger.</i>

1493
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,259
.

1494
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,760
<i>Louis caught marciano
with that one. It's hurt him. .</i>

1495
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:36,280
<i>He hangs in there, but that punch
caught marciano by surprise. .</i>

1496
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:39,769
He's hurt me.
He's hurt me.

1497
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:44,270
He's lettin' his left drop. Hang a few
upstairs, and let's get this over with.

1498
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,790
He's dead on his feet, rock..

1499
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:48,779
One good shot's
all it's gonna take.

1500
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,280
<i>One good shot.</i>

1501
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,339
.

1502
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,850
<i>And Louis is down!
Louis is down! .</i>

1503
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,839
<i>The crowd is on
its feet screaming. .</i>

1504
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,340
Go to the corner!

1505
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:54,840
<i>A devastating left
from marciano...</i>

1506
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:59,360
...2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1507
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,350
You all right, Joe?

1508
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,870
.

1509
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:56,409
<i>And it's over!</i>

1510
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:57,909
.

1511
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:59,909
<i>Marciano has done it! .</i>

1512
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:03,410
We win! We win!
Rocco beat Louis!

1513
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:11,920
.

1514
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:23,490
Rock, is it really you?

1515
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,510
It's me, Joe.

1516
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,000
What happened?

1517
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,010
You punch hard, kid.

1518
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,510
I need to ask you a question..

1519
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:41,510
What happened to me?

1520
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,019
I'm sorry, Joe.

1521
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,020
I... i never wanted
to have this fight.

1522
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,529
I never wanted to fight you.

1523
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:58,029
I'd... if it was 10 years ago,
I wouldn't have...

1524
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:00,030
You would've been a match.

1525
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:04,030
You're gonna win
that title, marciano.

1526
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:06,050
I got no doubt.

1527
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:09,040
You're a winner.

1528
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,040
But let me tell you somethin'.

1529
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:15,560
I won, rock.

1530
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:18,549
I won

1531
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:22,550
till I had nothin' left
in my life but winnin'.

1532
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,560
I won my wife away,

1533
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,060
I won all my money gone,

1534
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,560
my family.

1535
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:37,570
You got people who love you?

1536
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:39,570
Yeah.

1537
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,580
Don't ever let 'em go.

1538
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,580
They say you're crazy.

1539
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:56,100
I ain't crazy.

1540
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:01,090
I just got nothin' left.

1541
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,669
Spoke to you
about that yesterday..

1542
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:15,669
Yes, doctor.

1543
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:18,170
Just bring in your
time kits as usual.

1544
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:21,169
Excuse me.

1545
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:23,670
Mr. marciano, I've always
been a big fan of yours.

1546
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,179
I'm the administrator
of this hospital...

1547
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:29,679
Say, pal, uh, don't you know
you got Joe Louis in there?

1548
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,680
I mean, can't we find a better
room for him around here?

1549
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,189
I'm sorry, Mr. marciano,
but he's indigent.

1550
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,700
This is the best
the state can provide.

1551
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:42,190
Well, uh.

1552
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,200
Jensen, that man in there
is a friend of mine.

1553
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,200
Make sure he's looked after.

1554
01:33:54,210 --> 01:33:55,720
But, sir, I...

1555
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:59,209
<i>Be home the next
flight I can catch, Barbara.</i>

1556
01:33:59,210 --> 01:34:00,710
<i>3, 4 hours, tops. .</i>

1557
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,710
And I'm home to stay.

1558
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,219
What happened to Vegas?

1559
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:07,730
Oh, it don't matter.
I'm comin' home.

1560
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,220
.

1561
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:15,729
They're following you.

1562
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:16,729
Hey.

1563
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:17,730
Hi.

1564
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:20,730
Hi, Mrs. abodenzas.

1565
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,750
.

1566
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:53,260
Mr. andriole!
Open the gate!

1567
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:55,270
Rocco! You got it.

1568
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,799
.

1569
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,799
What're you doin' here?

1570
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,300
Come on, pop.
You've made your last shoe.

1571
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:33,810
Rocco. Rocco..

1572
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:43,310
What will you do now? All these
people, they come to see you.

1573
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,830
What is all this?

1574
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:52,320
I got the oysters for you, pop.

1575
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:55,330
We'll crush 'em up and make
you a real <i>bocce court. .</i>

1576
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,840
This is my son.

1577
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:21,350
.

1578
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:36,875
Hey, Mr. marciano.
I gotta tell you.

1579
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:40,369
I have never flown in anything this bad.
And I don't think we should.

1580
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:42,870
Come on, kid, I've flown
in worse than this.

1581
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,390
I gotta get home.
Let's go.
