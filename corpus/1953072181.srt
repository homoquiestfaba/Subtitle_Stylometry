1
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:35,462
In a small village in Asia called Serenity Falls ...

2
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,839
once lived a legendary fighter.

3
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:44,778
Fighter is so fabulous that his legend was legendary.

4
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,373
No opponent was not worthy of this great powerful warrior.

5
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,146
His name was Zibo.

6
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:58,383
The warrior was so terrible that no one dared to utter his name.

7
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,690
Zibo! Stop can dream and continue to ribas.

8
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,931
What?

9
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,628
I went myself, Zibo. I have the gym to practice.

10
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,569
Perfect as my body is not only sculpts, you know?

11
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,869
I'm sorry you dear cage, but ...

12
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:20,005
if you saw a great teacher Hana?
- Certainly. There it is there.

13
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:28,714
Perfect ingenuity. Perfect body. Naređajte is young!

14
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,054
Do you think I could've talked with Grandmaster Han?

15
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,321
Do not you talk with the teacher Hana.

16
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,990
Master Han story with you.

17
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:41,364
Do you think that the great teacher of Han to talk with me?

18
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:45,565
- No way. If ...
- If you?

19
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:50,576
If a teacher does not Han spilled tea and invite you to clean my!

20
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,047
Just kidding because it's funny to laugh ...

21
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,450
you.

22
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:06,424
Come on! Bali did not want to hurt feelings Zibova small.

23
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:11,796
You missed the place. When I go like this ...

24
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:16,495
And a mighty warrior, Ziba is tiresome Bali ...

25
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,438
and freed the great indignation of the Sun 1000!

26
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,636
Mighty warrior ...

27
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:29,911
need help.

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,926
CAREER DAY once lived a legendary warrior ...

29
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:48,833
so fabulous, that his legend was legendary.

30
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:54,205
No opponent was not worthy of this great powerful warrior.

31
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:57,478
You did not fight the dinosaurs. It is impossible.

32
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,947
- Yes.
- It is not.

33
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,849
- Yes.
- It is not.

34
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,613
Dad, tell him.

35
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:09,712
He's got a son. I fought the dinosaurs.

36
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,018
I fought two dinosaurs!

37
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,528
- It's super!
- No way!

38
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:21,591
Dinosaurs are extinct 200 million years ago.

39
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,628
These dinosaurs have fallen through a black hole ...

40
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,976
and were transferred to the future.

41
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:33,547
No physical evidence of the existence of black holes.

42
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,316
You're a genius was a department?

43
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:40,515
And there were black holes exist in the universe.

44
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,823
Actually, Einstein.

45
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:47,494
Because their space dinosaur with a small boat down the course ...

46
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:52,431
and was caught in the funnel of the gravitational field of a black hole!

47
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,639
It was a great dad! I can not wait ...

48
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,972
my friends to see action in dodžou tonight.

49
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,010
Really?

50
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,045
What? No, Ming!

51
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,105
Does not have to go to the dojo tonight.

52
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,914
I had the opportunity to talk with the teacher about Hana.

53
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:16,286
You said that you and friends can see the dojo where you train.

54
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,383
- I know, but I did not say when.
- You!

55
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,554
When I asked, you said "one day".

56
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,723
Today is the day.

57
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,824
Today is today, one day ...

58
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,197
Tomorrow?

59
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,535
No, tomorrow is tomorrow. Today is today.

60
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,904
- One day ...
- When?

61
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:39,206
Well, one day is ... One day!

62
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,508
Not today or tomorrow ...

63
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,608
but one day in the distant future.

64
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:50,384
Inter planetary teleportacionoj zavijugenoj future!

65
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,948
But I have already told friends this morning.

66
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,029
Come on. You know what are friends.

67
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,655
They must have already forgotten.

68
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,758
See you tonight at dodžou, Ming.

69
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,273
Please, Dad.

70
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:11,802
I will never anything else to ask while I'm alive. I promise.

71
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,076
Duplobećavam. Triplobećavam.

72
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,810
The answer is no.

73
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,122
I wish that my mother was there. It would certainly say that.

74
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,159
Yes, I would like to now mama here.

75
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:28,529
Do you know how. Popričaću with Grandmaster Han today.

76
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,191
- I'll see what I can.
- Promise?

77
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,529
- Triplobećavam.
- Thanks Dad.

78
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,152
Wow!

79
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,054
- Maybe I came in evil times?
- Nonsense.

80
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:01,958
Time is neither good nor evil. Although your timing could not be worse.

81
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,691
- Excuse me teacher.
- Enter.

82
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,824
You drew my attention. Now use it.

83
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,070
That's it. Should be used.

84
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,441
Duck is the best simmering at 200 degrees.

85
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,410
What's the matter so much on your mind?

86
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,311
Well ... Here's how.

87
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:24,480
I thought if I can bring my son and a couple of his friends in the dojo.

88
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,581
Today.

89
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,179
Never ask questions you already know the answer.

90
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,416
Right.

91
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:35,758
It is difficult, because it would mean that I know the answer.

92
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,959
- What I do not know.
- Look in your heart.

93
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:46,028
- I do not. I still do not know.
- Entăo lhe fare pergunta mind.

94
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,906
Do you really think that I refused your son and his friends?

95
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,070
Well, no. I did not mean that.

96
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,877
But I thought that time I only caretaker ...

97
00:06:55,983 --> 00:07:01,046
"Only"? You have only one son. But if you need to obezvrednimo ...

98
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,146
those things that's more?

99
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,885
Is it only the flowers? Only the trees?

100
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,359
Only butterflies? Only the bees?

101
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,522
Everything and everyone is ...

102
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,657
place equal importance in the universe.

103
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,465
Man! When you say so ...

104
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,768
Dojo is welcome for those who want to get on.

105
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:26,211
Thank you, teacher. Mr., your Highness, Mr. ...

106
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,942
Not at all, Zibo. I remember ...

107
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,450
broom in his right hand can be deadly ...

108
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:36,512
the sword in his left hand.
- Yes, to tell what the sword.

109
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,683
You would not believe the truth of it.

110
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,355
The young man knows the rules, the wise man knows the exceptions.

111
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,489
I do not follow from the "do not mention it, Zibo."

112
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:51,538
See, here is a real weapon. Not here.

113
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,666
I would be worried about blood loss ... here.

114
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,039
The concern is rust on the blade.

115
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,103
How did you become so wise teacher?

116
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,614
The second edition. There you go. Take it.

117
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,416
Really?

118
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,751
But ... All pages are blank.

119
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,091
Exactly. The only true wisdom ...

120
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:20,167
to know that you know nothing.

121
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,466
I know nothing!

122
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,977
How dare you come empty-handed?

123
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,879
I wanted to stop by to buy you a pot of flowers for the house.

124
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,781
You know, to be lively dinner ...

125
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,649
but I was late, and I had ...

126
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:46,182
- I'm talking about the necklace, you idiot!
- Exactly. Necklace.

127
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,387
I found it.

128
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,824
Still ... The search is a difficult master.

129
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,867
Heavier because of the presence of another.

130
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,563
- Second?
- Night janitor.

131
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:01,129
- Pnda called Zibo.
- Zgazio and ...

132
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,803
dulek than 200 pounds who eats bamboo?

133
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:08,006
I think the more accurate figure is about 300 pounds.

134
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:14,486
Search again, Bali. Search as long as you can.

135
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,355
And then again he seeks. Necklace "Fourier" ...

136
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:22,725
must be somewhere in dodžou my brother.

137
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:26,493
- Find it!
- To master.

138
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,298
With the collar in the possession ...

139
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,865
Serenity will be able to rule the Folsom with a firm hand ...

140
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:41,506
and crush all who oppose my will.

141
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,916
Can you suggest something before I go?

142
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,549
If you turn that you propose to paint the walls in green ...

143
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:56,330
then do not! Do not be.
- No, I did not want to.

144
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,457
Although if we painted the walls in green ...

145
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,501
We really have entered the outside to the inside.

146
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,468
What is your suggestion?

147
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,437
The first thing to do when you come to power ...

148
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:10,340
to change the name of the village. I mean, Serenity Falls? Really?

149
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,870
"Serenity" is a state of peace, tranquility and peace of mind.

150
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,748
- I like the irony.
- Ironically, a lot of fun.

151
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,343
Especially the oppressed. Invent a name ...

152
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,218
We will put something in the sign ...

153
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,192
strong-arm rule that breaks opponents in hopelessness.

154
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,262
- Like what?
- I do not know.

155
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:33,629
Something appealing. Something powerful ...

156
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,136
- Can Balivud?
- Get out.

157
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:43,869
Come back tomorrow with a necklace or feel my wrath!

158
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:48,437
To master. Balivud, it sounds just fine ...

159
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:55,012
Mightier than the sword.

160
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,089
Add to my inferior opponents, we are not equal ...

161
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:05,722
Intestinal attack! Or disappear from my hands!

162
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:10,929
- I will never surrender!
- Never say never.

163
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,108
You missed me. You want some of this?

164
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,477
Is this pain? Failure.

165
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,247
- What to do?
- Trained.

166
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,772
For what? Struggle with public works.

167
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,749
Please stop!

168
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:29,312
My sword is nothing compared to your superior martial arts skills!

169
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,721
I give up!

170
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,559
So the rule of an evil nobleman 100'godišnja ...

171
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:45,272
met its inglorious end!
- It was amazing!

172
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:50,733
What? This? Just a little revive memories of combat, that's all.

173
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:54,042
I've never heard of a warrior train with a broom.

174
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:58,584
Once a wise man said, "The Broom of the left hand ...

175
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:04,284
can be deadly with a sword in the wrong. "

176
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,062
It made sense when he said.

177
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,758
Where to put the sleeping bags?

178
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,500
Why have you brought a sleeping bag?

179
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,060
Do not we would be comfortable to sleep on the wooden floor.

180
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:19,765
No, no, no. No one will be nowhere to sleep.

181
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,842
Have you heard people? We will stay awake all night.

182
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:28,637
Hi, I am Shiva. Thank you for allowing us to come to the teacher Zibo.

183
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:34,449
Teacher Zibo ... Well, in the dojo are welcome all who wish to enter.

184
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:40,220
- Why is it called a dojo?
- What do you think, why so called?

185
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,227
Dojo means "path way".

186
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,820
Way of practicing Tae Kwon Doe.

187
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,027
That's it. "Put ways." Exactly.

188
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,538
- What's your name?
- His name is Koji.

189
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:57,168
- Koji does not like to talk a lot.
- Strong and silent character.

190
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,876
Only a faint image.

191
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:07,120
Remember, Kodžo, here is a real weapon.

192
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,823
Not here.

193
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:14,954
What is the difference between Tae Kwon Doe and Karate?

194
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,191
- Three words.
- Funny Daddy.

195
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:23,100
- What is the difference?
- The difference? Yeah, well ...

196
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,205
Karate is more ...

197
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:32,802
The fazon. A Tae Kwon Do is ...

198
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,513
Can you show us how to train in the style of a great warrior?

199
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,522
Great warrior must train for years.

200
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,118
- It takes years of intensive work.
- Come on, show us the father.

201
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,720
Break boards with bare red paw.

202
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:56,235
- Can it?
- Of course you can, right dad?

203
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,808
Just warming up.

204
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,527
Becomes hotter.

205
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,101
You did it!

206
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,878
Tae Kwon Do is more than raw power.

207
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:48,512
It is important to train the mind.

208
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:52,319
To my mind like an athlete, he ran the marathon.

209
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,691
Had he not stumbled on your ego.

210
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,825
Make a fist with your paw.

211
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,531
The other hand holding open.

212
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,541
Fist on the palm three times ...

213
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:14,444
when you say "hammer, scissors, paper."

214
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,415
Then wisely choose one of them.

215
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,883
Wait, is this not "Zikata, zakata, Zoom"?

216
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,479
No, there are many names, "winter, winter zoom" ...

217
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,251
"Beneficiary, Snake, Snuka," "Eci, oven, stove" ...

218
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,620
"Going around you pussy."

219
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,991
As is linked to the Tae Kwon Do?

220
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,258
It is a ridiculous game.

221
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,800
Rules can be simple ...

222
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:40,101
but the game is as complex as the mind of your opponent.

223
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,697
Is not that the luck?

224
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,471
It is a game of strategy and intuition.

225
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,740
You see through the enemy intends ...

226
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,817
or face certain defeat.

227
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,479
I never watched that way.

228
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:57,489
I did not either. I mean, I am not even in your years.

229
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,821
How do we know what to choose?

230
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:03,351
You know the heart of your opponent.

231
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,489
"Stone", is a barbaric move ...

232
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,468
and use it to your most aggressive opponents.

233
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:15,497
"Scissors", can be aggressive but controlled more choice ...

234
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,873
used by smart and capable opponents.

235
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,878
A "paper"?

236
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:23,814
Yes. "Paper" is a wise choice.

237
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,541
Do you think this is a weakness.

238
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:29,613
No, there is a silent power in words such as "paper".

239
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,793
It has the ability to declare war on other nations ...

240
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:39,959
spreading gossip or statement generous love.

241
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:45,169
Okay, enough talk. To go into practice?

242
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,435
- Who is a volunteer?
- I.

243
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:53,138
Remember. You are a student and I am a teacher.

244
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:58,843
Observe carefully presents the movement of my opponent.

245
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,755
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

246
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,155
Scissors are stronger than paper.

247
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,023
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

248
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,562
The paper is stronger than stone.

249
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,566
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

250
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,603
The stone is stronger than scissors. This is fun!

251
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:26,346
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
- Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

252
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,916
Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

253
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,453
Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

254
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:38,652
Zikata, zakata ... Tandara Mandara ...

255
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:47,231
The paper is stronger than stone. Smorilo me play. I give up.

256
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,897
The winner is the loser to give up. So why the wins.

257
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:01,341
Quickly take a stone from my feet.

258
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:06,784
When you manage to take a stone from my feet, then your training is complete.

259
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,013
Where was gone?

260
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:12,057
That does not count, I said "go."

261
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,184
Go.

262
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,900
Go.

263
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,560
Go.

264
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,800
For you we need another test.

265
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,576
I'll show you some basic techniques Kenda ...

266
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,685
with ordinary brooms for scrubbing.

267
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:42,722
Why not use sticks made of bamboo?

268
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:47,056
Bamboo makes 98% of baby panda.

269
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,654
Typically eat up to half staff training.

270
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,598
Zebo Master, who is it?

271
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,702
This is a great teacher, Han.

272
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,297
He is one of the greatest warriors who walked the earth.

273
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:06,913
Large tiger warrior who made peace in Serenity Falls.

274
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,115
How is it managed?

275
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:13,711
Was expelled from his evil brother Slade, forever out of the valley.

276
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,221
Where did he go?

277
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,625
No one knows exactly where it is Slade.

278
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,661
Some think they are hiding in the mountains ...

279
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,464
waiting for the right moment to come back ..

280
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,866
and revenge is a great teacher, Han ...

281
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,503
and the government of Serenity Folsom forever!

282
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,733
Fear not, Kodžače.

283
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:36,263
While the necklace "Fourier" Slejdovog out of reach ...

284
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,072
he has no power to do any harm.

285
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:44,310
- Necklace "Fourier"?
- Is it a necklace?

286
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:49,321
Yes. Anyone who carries, possesses great power.

287
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:54,427
- What power?
- Great power.

288
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,861
- What?
- Unusual.

289
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,297
- Specify?
- The magnificent ...

290
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:05,394
impressive, and overall brand deafening from all absolute power!

291
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,268
What gives power to the necklace?

292
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:13,580
Crystal necklace contains lava from the depths of a volcano named Baekdu.

293
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,849
- This is great!
- Yes.

294
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,579
Baekdu Mountain is considered "divine mountain" ...

295
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:23,588
because some believe that it is the birthplace of our ancestors.

296
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,615
Necklace is taught by a great teacher to another ...

297
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,363
for thousands of years.

298
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,093
Where a teacher Han holds a necklace?

299
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:36,236
Only he knows where he is.

300
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,740
But the story that is hidden somewhere in dodžou.

301
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,801
- In this dodžou?
- Super! Find it!

302
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,710
You will not get you anything you need.

303
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,010
Necklace "Furies" is not a toy.

304
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,348
Otherwise called "Necklace of fun."

305
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,649
Now back to Kendo exercises.

306
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:59,726
- "Super!" We return to metlanju.
- Just kidding you ...

307
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:04,823
but when ovladaš these moves, it has to "clean my opponents."

308
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:09,459
Get it? "Clean my" opponents.

309
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,333
Is this on? Joking aside ...

310
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:20,413
I'll show you a classic kendo move called "Kiri-Kaes".

311
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,449
Smite the left and right side of his opponent ...

312
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,218
at high speed.

313
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,812
This requires a range of abilities ...

314
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,549
Accuracy, rhythm, and smoothness.

315
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,150
This combined with the acceleration and endurance.

316
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:37,060
Watch and learn.

317
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:47,635
- What is he doing?
- I think šlogirao.

318
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,700
- I think that meditating.
- Yes. I meditate.

319
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,552
Sun you!

320
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:11,392
Have you made a necklace?

321
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:15,457
Not really, but I did not come empty-handed.

322
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:23,937
Did not I tell you that if you come back empty handed ...

323
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,205
have to feel my wrath?

324
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,803
"Did not I tell you that if you come back empty handed ...

325
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,975
have to feel ... "
- What are you doing?

326
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,044
Sorry, but your set of sentences is a bit confusing.

327
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,919
When you say, "Did not I tell ..."

328
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,858
if you ask me if you told me, or did you say?

329
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:48,662
I am really sorry for the confusion. It was a rhetorical question.

330
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:53,798
Let me rephrase the question as a statement.

331
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,774
Get ready to see his creator!

332
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,937
She came to me mama?

333
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:04,644
Do you have any last words before suffering himself cut short by getting

334
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:06,445
you to cut short?

335
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,988
I pray you. I have a very good explanation.

336
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:14,160
Then I suggest you quickly explain while still breathing.

337
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,696
Remember that the housekeeper that I mentioned?

338
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,392
- Fat panda?
- Just that.

339
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,068
Tonight, there were others in dodžou.

340
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:26,300
- Others?
- A group of small animals.

341
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:31,503
- Maybe it's the dinner.
- One of the children was his son.

342
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:36,079
And what to do with finding a necklace?

343
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:39,310
You do not think you could look for that ...

344
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,751
because natovljena panda ...

345
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:45,813
and the seven dwarfs left off on your way?

346
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:50,192
Dude, you're really good. Really know how to Rabisha people.

347
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:56,361
I feel uncharacteristically merciful.

348
00:23:56,469 --> 00:24:00,929
That's why I'm offering you a choice. You can go back to the dojo ...

349
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,032
and bring back my necklace until dawn ...

350
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:10,208
or you can stay here and die, and I assure you ...

351
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:17,451
it will be very slow and painful death thoroughly.

352
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:36,633
I wonder what your dad thinks while meditating.

353
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:41,669
- I do not know.
- You might think of your mom?

354
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:47,276
- Maybe.
- Do you miss him?

355
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:51,255
- I guess.
- Certainly so.

356
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:57,763
- Are you missing?
- Yes.

357
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,264
When mom got sick, she said she will watch me ...

358
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,166
Although I can no longer see her.

359
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,103
Do you think that you now observe?

360
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:12,236
- I do not know.
- Certainly so.

361
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:17,578
- I'm glad I came tonight.
- Me too.

362
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,881
Kodžo, is that you?

363
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,594
The horror!

364
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,035
Good bird, Kodžo!

365
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,606
Why did I even left a nice England?

366
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:44,440
Pubs, palaces, the white cliffs of Dover ...

367
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,341
pubs.

368
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,976
Bali Teacher! Glad to see you.

369
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,644
- Can you help me?
- Again, your back?

370
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:57,723
- I am afraid it is.
- Well, here we go.

371
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,726
Ready? 1, 2, 3, pull pull!

372
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,333
- Much better.
- Cracks!

373
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,064
Fast. Ziba teacher needs help.

374
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,731
No! It's okay. It's not a burglar.

375
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:18,332
This teacher is Bali. Are you okay?

376
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:23,405
Jašta! I felt much better not to sit the whole weight on my spine!

377
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,950
Of course. Sorry about that teacher.

378
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:29,647
- Actual him!
- What are you doing here so late?

379
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,088
Master Han sent me to take the necklace "Furies."

380
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,659
- The real necklace?
- Yes.

381
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,060
He gave me precise instructions to find her ...

382
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,690
and to bring him up to dawn.

383
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:45,567
Hold on. Master Han told you where the necklace is hidden?

384
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,298
Of course.

385
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,442
I could not get it back

386
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,933
I do not know exactly where the hidden ...

387
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,377
- Can I see it?
- I want to see.

388
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,312
So do I.

389
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,309
No, no, no and jok.

390
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:06,414
- Please, Daddy?
- I guess there is nothing wrong.

391
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,722
- Do you?
- Well, I ...

392
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:13,322
- Then solved.
- Thank a teacher Bali.

393
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,992
Nothing. You know how ...

394
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:19,367
Let's have a contest. Something like a treasure hunt.

395
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,997
Everyone needs to find a secret site ...

396
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,043
and the first to find a necklace that can hold

397
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,047
while others can only watch.
- Super. I can not wait.

398
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:32,312
- I do not know.
- We invite kakanjca fun.

399
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,114
We invite kakanjca fun.

400
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:38,680
Please contact the bore area to take your prize.

401
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,784
I am not kakanjac fun ...

402
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:46,354
- Kakanjac fun, fun kakanjac.
- Kakanjac fun, fun kakanjac.

403
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:51,061
Wait! I do not kakim strangled by anyone's fun. Have fun.

404
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,334
- The very ...
- Mr. kakanjac ...

405
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:58,077
the fun!
- Good. You win.

406
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,601
It's great!

407
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,510
Let us go then. Shall we?

408
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:08,451
- I and I to play, right?
- The more the better socialize my bladder.

409
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,389
Ready, set, go!

410
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,459
Get out of my way!

411
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:18,724
Simply pie!

412
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,467
His sun! Sun!

413
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,387
Giving up Teacher Bali.

414
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:47,255
You can not give up! Not now!

415
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:54,333
- Now tell us where the necklace is hidden.
- How could I know parsley him!

416
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:59,038
You said that was a great teacher Han told you exactly where it is located.

417
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,873
I know what I said.

418
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:04,877
So you should be looking for that I completely forgot.

419
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:08,848
I really do not remember? You need to play "sudoku" ...

420
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:12,952
Since it strengthens memory.
- I do not need a mind game!

421
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:15,284
I need a necklace!

422
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:22,061
- Necklace "Fourier"!
- I found it!

423
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,463
You found it!

424
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:28,331
- We need to put her down quickly.
- Is too high.

425
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,470
- How to reach?
- With the pillars.

426
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,134
- We do not have stairs.
- We are the stairs.

427
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,025
That's right! That's right!

428
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:56,290
Faster Kobi. My legs are ugrčiše.

429
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,869
Bravo! Now I add.

430
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,176
Can we see it?

431
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,479
- Rumble. Smurfs are not you this.
- But you said ...

432
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,615
Never mind what I said. There are skinned to me ...

433
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,517
as an ox in cabbage ...

434
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,610
and it is decorated with me if I take this not Slade.

435
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,789
Slade? You just said Slade.

436
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,959
- I.
- You did.

437
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,060
I did not.

438
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,362
- Yes, you did.
- Yes, you did.

439
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,889
- I did not.
- Yes, I'm afraid you did.

440
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,299
- I did not.
- Yes! I'm afraid you are.

441
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,439
Slide, how nice surprise!

442
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:44,000
I began to think how to come back.

443
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:48,447
So I wanted to take matters into their own hands.

444
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,750
No need to master. It took a little longer

445
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,241
but I found the necklace.

446
00:30:56,622 --> 00:31:03,994
Give me a necklace pando. Then I'll spare you and your circus animals.

447
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:16,069
Dad, you will probably give him that right?

448
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:23,649
How nice! It says. Now give me a necklace ...

449
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:29,655
in order to establish his rule of tyranny over the Serenity Folsom.

450
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:32,057
Tata, zaustavićeš it, right?

451
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,790
You think you can stop the janitor great warriors like Slade?

452
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:40,821
Janitor? My dad is the greatest warrior of all time!

453
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,767
No opponent who was taller than him.

454
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,973
You even own son persuaded in their funny stories?

455
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:51,272
Not the story, it's true!

456
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:59,418
It is true that your dad just cleaned up the mess that other animals leave.

457
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,410
You are lying! My dad is so fabulous ...

458
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:07,050
that his legend and legendary. Tell him daddy.

459
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,967
Sorry Ming. He's right.

460
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:20,462
I was not a great warrior. I'm just a janitor.

461
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:33,712
"Only"? Do you remember anything I taught you?

462
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:42,117
- Brother.
- I warned you not coming back here.

463
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:47,665
"I warned you not coming back here," You were always righteous.

464
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,860
You must have a major baja at parties.

465
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:57,705
Counter to 3 Vanish, or I will have no choice but to chase away the force.

466
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:02,681
- You and what army?
- Army of ...

467
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,275
1. 

468
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:10,687
- 2, 3
- I'm still here, dude.

469
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:15,249
- Not for long, Sherman.
- Sherman?

470
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,900
I told you not to call me that!

471
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,269
But it is your birth name. Sherman Nevil.

472
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:49,395
- Your powers are weak.
- You can not beat Slade.

473
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:54,133
"If I were poured out, I will become stronger than you could imagine."

474
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:58,003
For the love of God, forsake me Jodinih these citations.

475
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:01,673
I spoke to you while we were kids and izluđivalo me.

476
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,743
Actually, it's Obi Wan, Yoda is.

477
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,347
- I do not care and that Jar Jar pickles.
- Binks.

478
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,249
What a fool boring!

479
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,985
Neither I can not boast that my favorite character.

480
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:16,255
Not him! You!

481
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:20,919
- Give me a necklace janitor!
No

482
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:24,485
- Die then!
- That's it?

483
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,723
There is no other solution except death?

484
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,324
Go get him Dad!

485
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,773
I can not watch!

486
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,543
Someone tell me what happens.

487
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:40,012
Bali Teacher Zeba helmet.

488
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,003
Not!

489
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:47,583
Right. Now it helmet.

490
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:55,049
Dad, look out!

491
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,434
Lord! I have a necklace!

492
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:07,337
My! My very own! I have long waited for this day.

493
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:11,433
With the possession of the necklace, I will soon become king ...

494
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,047
Serenity Falls, and all will bow to me.

495
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:18,016
- Quickly, we have something to do!
- I have an idea!

496
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,052
- What?
- Let us break out!

497
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:23,510
- No, we must take the medallion!
- How?

498
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:29,428
Koji, what do you have stones that you took from the clutches of my dad?

499
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:32,264
Perfect. Draw the attention of them throwing stones ...

500
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,926
and you grab the medallion. Can?

501
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,197
I hear what you say!

502
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,239
Your voice is subtracted from these wood floors.

503
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:47,074
Maybe next time you're whispering. But it does not matter.

504
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:51,410
No interference was not enough that the bananožder ...

505
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:55,817
deducted from my necklace.

506
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,623
You're really fast!

507
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:08,596
I'm fast. Now give me a necklace.

508
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,466
No
- Then I'll take it from you!

509
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:14,836
Fast Daddy! Make it!

510
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,463
You did it, Daddy!

511
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:22,140
You saved the Serenity Falls horrible fate.

512
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,042
I'm not myself, but necklace "Furies."

513
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:31,048
The power of the necklace is in the mind of one who is the owner.

514
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:34,244
When someone asks where the necklace gets power ...

515
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:39,723
I reply, "inside".
- You say that I did all this?

516
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,850
As a "book of wisdom" that I gave you ...

517
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,795
Necklace is powerful only as long as the person possesses.

518
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:51,096
For someone, it has all the answers, for others, only questions.

519
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:55,264
- So you did a great warrior!
- Your son is telling the truth ...

520
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:59,834
- Master Zibo.
- Teacher Zibo?
