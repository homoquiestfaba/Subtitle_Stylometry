paddle this far out, though.

coming with the rest too.

Let's have some action.

Hey John.
Look at that owl.

It looks like it's watching us.

I think not.

56

But there's no doubt that foul
play was behind the dozens

Of unsolved disappearances
in the Everglades

58
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:51,004
Over the past 100 years.

59
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,207
The real question
is who or what is

60
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,743
Behind these
disappearances, and whether

61
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,712
Or not they are all linked
to one source of evil.

62
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:03,417
Could it be a serial
killer, a monster?

63
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,553
A skunk ape or chupacabra.

64
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:10,090
Or perhaps a brotherhood
of killers linked by blood.

Legend has it that a restless
Native American spirit named

the big cypress swamp

67

Since the Seminole Wars, killing
hapless American tourists

68

end of those Seminole Wars

In the late 1850s, but they have
persisted to the present day.

of a devastating true life

one surviving witness.

for the Everglades camping

to go out in the Everglades?

Everglades a lot of times.

of alligators.

come out there

00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Are you deaf?

185
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,153
I said do you know how
to get to the lobby?

186
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,360
Coowahchobee see you
attack woman at pool.

187
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,262
You offend woman.

188
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,396
You offend Coowahchobee.

189
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,397
Whatever.

190
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,732
Say your prayers, kimo sabe.

191
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,901
Because I will
kill you and I will

192
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,671
Cast your severed limbs
into the ocean as sacrifice

193
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,606
To gods of the sea!

194
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,540
Get away from me.

195
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,374
You're crazy.

196
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,676
What are you doing?

197
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,414
[Indian drumming]

198
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,183
Now I will drain
your body of blood

199
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,219
Like your people have drained
my Everglades of water!

200
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,722
[Scream]

201
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,629
[Country music]

202
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,742
Welcome to Ted's
Swamp Safari, ladies.

203
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,712
We're going to be driving to
the Big Cypress Reservation.

204
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:06,647
We're gonna canoe out
to a beautiful cabin.

205
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,718
You will have at your disposal
hiking trips, fishing,

206
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:11,819
Canoeing, whatever you want.

207
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,387
And a whole lot of wildlife.

208
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,522
Is everyone accounted for?

209
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,757
Yes, we're all here.

210
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:17,758
My name's Mama Bear.

211
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,159
I spoke to you on the phone.

212
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,194
How could I forget a
name like Mama Bear.

213
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,130
Thank you so much for
the generous discount.

214
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,665
It's a pleasure.

215
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,533
Actually, Columbus Day has
been notoriously slow for us.

216
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,969
So I was happy to give
you guys a discount.

217
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,971
Now, without further
ado, why don't we

218
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,074
Head out to the Big Cypress
and have a killer weekend.

219
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,042
Come on, ladies.

220
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,668
I told you guys we were gonna
be way out in the jungle.

221
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,135
This is crazy.

222
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,504
I can't believe we need a
machete to cut us a path.

223
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,039
Yeah, but that's the point.

224
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,242
We came out here to confront
our fears, to become one

225
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,645
With nature, and grow stronger.

226
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,947
Oh, shut up.

227
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,248
It's going to be
great, you guys.

228
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,083
Let's go.

229
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,320
This is where the road ends.

230
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,621
From here on in,
we're going to be

231
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,390
Paddling canoes until
we get to the island

232
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,324
That the cabin is on.

233
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,158
Right this way.

234
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,569
OK.

235
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,805
Watch out for this thing.

236
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,206
It's gonna smack you
right in the face.

237
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,408
I'm sure you know
how to swim, Sandy.

238
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,776
I know, Mama Bear.

239
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,377
You're such a scaredy cat.

240
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,779
I'm not a scaredy cat!

241
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,480
The water is two feet.

242
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,615
OK.

243
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,050
I'm going to steer
the first canoe.

244
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,352
Tonya, Veronica, you
guys will paddle.

245
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:53,186
Mama Bear.

246
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:53,987
Yeah.

247
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,022
You steer the second canoe.

248
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,589
The other gals will all paddle.

249
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,826
Now, remember, if
you see an alligator,

250
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,127
They cannot tip the canoe.

251
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,962
But if you freak out
and fall in the water,

252
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,697
You're gonna be dead meat.

253
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,132
Oh.
Wonderful.

254
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,133
Don't worry, girls.

255
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,534
You'll be fine.

256
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,137
We got this, girls.

257
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,205
It's gonna be fun!

258
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,540
Paddles, ladies!

259
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,674
My hand is stuck
under the bridge!

260
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,409
Ow.
-Don't worry, baby girl.

261
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,945
You didn't mess up your nails.

262
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,213
You guys are really not the
brightest bulbs in the box,

263
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,481
I gotta tell ya.

264
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,615
Want to take a paddle?

265
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,184
[Shriek]

266
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,787
This is like Keystone
Cops on canoes.

267
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,798
Oh my god, is
that a real gator?

268
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:38,999
Yeah, that's a real gator!

269
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,367
Look at him!

270
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,334
OK, big boy.

271
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,335
I'll see you, OK?

272
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,904
Aww, bye bye.

273
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,673
Bye bye.

274
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:49,242
Help!

275
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,143
Help me!

276
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,345
You have to help me.

277
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,681
I don't know how much you
know about your husband,

278
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:55,883
Coowahchobee, but I saw him.

279
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,619
He killed people
right in front of me.

280
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,553
Oh please!

281
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,722
He has to be stopped.

282
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:06,293
He's just a disgrace
to your culture.

283
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,560
Guys, where are we going?

284
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,629
This is taking forever.

285
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,931
I'm thirsty.

286
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,399
Ted, is there any water?

287
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,101
No, we don't need any water.

288
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,203
So Ted, how much
longer do you think?

289
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,104
We're very close.

290
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,007
Just another 15 minutes or so.

291
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,241
Oh my god!

292
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,277
[Scream]

293
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,278
TED: Leave it alone.

294
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,915
Take it easy.

295
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,716
We're going to go that way.

296
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,319
There is a real
fucking alligator.

297
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,220
It wasn't fucking.

298
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,087
MAMA BEAR: Don't panic!

299
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,722
Hey, hey.

300
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,057
Watch it, ladies.

301
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:37,991
Just calm.

302
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,626
Deep, cleansing breaths.

303
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,029
OK?

304
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,631
I swear that I saw
that tree before.

305
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,866
Yeah, it does look familiar?

306
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,367
Are we going in circles, Ted?

307
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,668
Of course not.

308
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,937
There are millions of
trees in this swamp

309
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,438
And some just look the same.

310
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,841
I don't think he knows
where he's taking us.

311
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,708
Yeah, he said it'd be fifteen
minutes like five times

312
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:56,877
Already.

313
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,145
I'm starting to
get really worried.

314
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:58,778
Hey Ted.

315
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,147
How much longer?

316
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,348
Fifteen minutes.

317
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,616
I don't mean to doubt
you, but you have already

318
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,853
Told us like five times.

319
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:10,323
As I said, we'll be
there in 15 minutes.

320
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,859
Oh please, I promise.

321
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,626
You let me out of
here and I will tell

322
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,528
No one about your Coowahchobee.

323
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,801
I can't believe we
didn't bring any water.

324
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,536
Can we drink the swamp water?

325
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,838
No.

326
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,039
It'll make you sick
and give you diarrhea.

327
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,209
I hate you, Mama Bear.

328
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,644
Do you think of something
terrible happened and one of us

329
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,048
Had to run back in an emergency,
that you'd be able to find

330
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,250
Your way back to the boat dock?

331
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,986
I don't know.

332
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,420
I've been trying
to pay attention,

333
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,891
But it all looks the same.

334
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:48,661
And being a little bit
high doesn't help either.

335
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,063
OK?

336
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,399
I'm getting a
little hungry too.

337
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,300
Don't worry.

338
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,234
We'll be there soon, OK?

339
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,335
I hope so.

340
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,269
I'm scared.

341
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,404
I want to go home.
-Don't worry.

342
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,671
We're safe.

343
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,873
We're going to get
there any minute now.

344
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:00,874
Isn't that right, Ted?

345
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,109
TED: Yes, of course.

346
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,676
You all need to chill out.

347
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,378
We'll be at the campground--

348
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,313
ALL: In fifteen minutes!

349
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,318
This is bullshit.

350
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,786
I'm turning this canoe
around and we are going back.

351
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:14,922
You think you
know your way back?

352
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,456
Yeah, I think so.

353
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,258
What are you going to do when
you get back and it's dark

354
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,759
And I have the
keys to the truck?

355
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,595
You're coming with us
and driving us back.

356
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,031
Calm down, people.

357
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,899
This is supposed to be
fun and self-empowering,

358
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,467
In your own words.

359
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,904
You contacted me and you signed
up for Ted's Swamp Safari

360
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,039
And this is part of it.

361
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,306
Now, if you wanted
to stay around

362
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,874
And lay at the pool
in South Beach,

363
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,309
You should have stayed home.

364
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,745
Now this is a chance
for you to grow

365
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,247
And have a great experience.

366
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,715
Now do you want to continue
or do you want to sit here

367
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,783
And cry like babies and go home?

368
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,617
All right.

369
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,585
Let's just go.

370
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:46,619
Come on.
Whatever.

371
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,454
Good.

372
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,755
Now let's go.

373
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,822
OK, fine.

374
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:50,657
Whatever.

375
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:51,558
All right.

376
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,627
Let's just keep going.

377
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,495
We're here.

378
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,639
All right, ladies.

379
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,775
Let me take you to the cabin
so you can get settled in.

380
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,443
So uh, Ted.

381
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,279
Is there anyone else in
the cabin this weekend?

382
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,547
There was another couple
here, but they left,

383
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,616
So you guys are going to
have the cabin to yourself

384
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,884
For the whole weekend.

385
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:18,718
Good.

386
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,589
Home, sweet home.

387
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,556
Nice.

388
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,824
It's really, really nice.

389
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,159
This is better than I expected.

390
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:26,793
Come on.

391
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,762
I'm excited.

392
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:30,897
I get the top bunk.

393
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:31,731
Oh no.

394
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,066
I'll race you to it.

395
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,402
There are a couple beds
here on the bottom floor

396
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,570
And there are a lot more beds
upstairs on the top floor.

397
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,540
Why don't you take a look?

398
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,009
I'm staying down here.

399
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,043
TED: Pick what you want.

400
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,318
So did you find a bed you like?

401
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,585
Yeah.

402
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,922
I did, but I also found my
friend Roselyn's luggage.

403
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,024
Look, this is her necklace.

404
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,591
That looks familiar.

405
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,161
I'm sure I saw her paddling
away with her boyfriend, though.

406
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,563
Let me see that, please.

407
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,831
That's definitely Roselyn's.

408
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,233
This is definitely
Roselyn's necklace.

409
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,900
Why would she leave her
luggage behind, especially

410
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,869
If it had her valuables in it?

411
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,937
It's a good question.

412
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,006
Who knows?

413
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,808
Maybe she's still here and
will be back for dinner.

414
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,010
Don't worry, Sandy.

415
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,546
We'll find out where
Roselyn is soon.

416
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,114
Everything will be fine.

417
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,316
Ted, could you please show
us where the bathrooms are?

418
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:23,950
Follow me.

419
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,784
Great.

420
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,305
This is the shower.

421
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,274
You mean it's
not even enclosed?

422
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,909
This is camping out in
Mother Nature at its finest.

423
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,781
I'm almost afraid to ask, but
where is the toilet exactly?

424
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:55,782
Follow me.

425
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,616
Ew.

426
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,487
-This is the toilet.
-Ew.

427
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,254
What?

428
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,689
You expect me to use that?

429
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,057
It's disgusting.

430
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,625
Hey, at least you'll
never have to worry

431
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,227
About a cold toilet seat.

432
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,263
And the snakes and alligators
will give you lots of privacy.

433
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,531
I can't believe that.

434
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,900
This concludes the
grand tour for now.

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,535
Why don't you guys
get settled in?

436
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,370
I'm going to go see about
giving us some dinner.

437
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,339
You guys can do some exploring.

438
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,808
Just remember to be back
here by 7:00 so that we

439
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:22,709
Can barbecue for dinner.

440
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,543
Got it.

441
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,911
See you guys.

442
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,479
Something to look forward to.

443
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,353
Please.

444
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,287
Please.

445
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,089
I won't tell
anybody about Carla.

446
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,857
About John.

447
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:38,891
Please just let me out of here.

448
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,660
I'll do anything.

449
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,729
You now belong to Coowahchobee.

450
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:43,996
This is your home.

451
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,432
Coowahchobee your husband.

452
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,700
You are Coowahchobee's
wife, White Rain.

453
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,668
Your wife?

454
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,237
I will never love you.

455
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,639
You are wearing
a wedding dress.

456
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,707
It is done by Seminole law.

457
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,177
If Coowahchobee let you
out, you be good wife?

458
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,078
You make little
baby Coowahchobees?

459
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,046
I said I'd do anything.

460
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,649
Just let me out of here.

461
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,483
Please.

462
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,038
Coowahchobee likes this.

463
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,508
Coowahchobee make baby
Coowahchobees with you.

464
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,277
Very nice.

465
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:31,478
Coowahchobee like boobies.

466
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,983
Coowahchobee likes this.

467
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,818
Ow!

468
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,786
No!

469
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:40,620
Help!

470
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,593
Help!

471
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,960
No!

472
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,962
Dream all you want, White Rain.

473
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,164
We're in the middle
of the Everglades.

474
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,166
Nobody going to hear you.

475
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,368
Let go of me, you bastard!

476
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,670
Coowahchobee own you, woman.

477
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,805
We are married.

478
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,641
Like your people say,
til death do us part.

479
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,246
Dude, I'm starving.

480
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,715
Do you know when dinner is?

481
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,250
Soon.

482
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,519
Ted said he was coming
around 7:00 to get us.

483
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,322
Do you really think that Roselyn
would leave her luggage behind?

484
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,689
Even her necklace?

485
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,991
I forgot about that.

486
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,126
Yeah.

487
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:24,431
Well, Sandy, she
is kind of a ditz.

488
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,064
Shut up.

489
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,866
That's not nice.

490
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:27,900
I'm sorry, honey.

491
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,835
I'm just saying.

492
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,870
It's possible.

493
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,205
Well, I guess you're right.

494
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,473
But I could never see
her leaving with John

495
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,475
And Carla instead
hang out with us.

496
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:40,079
Sandy, John is a Grade
A piece of man meat.

497
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,715
There's no way Roselyn
wouldn't fall for him.

498
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,116
And betray me?

499
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,586
She knew that we had a thing.

500
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,820
A thing?

501
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,855
Really?

502
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,758
John has a thing with all of us.

503
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,593
I know we had a thing.

504
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,427
Me too.

505
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,497
I know a thing about John thing.

506
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,766
Spare me the details please.

507
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,601
Girls, girls.

508
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,970
You know that Sandy
believes in true love

509
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,640
And all that beautiful stuff.

510
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,743
Please don't ruin it for her
with all of your catty gossip.

511
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:11,711
It's OK.

512
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,112
I mean, I knew
that he got around.

513
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,347
I just didn't
realize he got around

514
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,849
With everyone in this room.

515
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,487
[Laughter]

516
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,389
Why do you think
John is the only guy

517
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:26,359
Invited on our all-girls
little expedition to the wild?

518
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,961
He's practically like
a brother to all of us.

519
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,100
Well, to me anyway.

520
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,271
What we did was
nothing brotherly.

521
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,006
Now the truth comes out.

522
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:40,840
Dirty.

523
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,245
[Whispering]

524
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,880
What was that?

525
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,715
What is it?

526
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,753
You heard it too, didn't you?

527
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,588
I think we should go
downstairs and check it out.

528
00:20:55,688 --> 00:21:00,159
I think somebody's out there.

529
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,762
[Whispering]

530
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,342
So who do you think
would be walking

531
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,077
Around waiting out here?

532
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,547
Maybe it's a
mass-murdering cannibal.

533
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:24,183
Or an alien from
another planet.

534
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,152
Or maybe it's a
giant alligator.

535
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,088
Or maybe it's just Ted.

536
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,122
Sandy.

537
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,090
You're always ruin everything.

538
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,258
All right.

539
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,693
Whoever's out there
better watch out

540
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,396
Because we're a bunch of
angry, self-empowered bitches

541
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,530
Who eat men for dinner.

542
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,098
Ain't that right, girls?

543
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,233
ALL: Yeah!

544
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,068
Whoa.

545
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:42,902
Don't worry.

546
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,203
It's just me, Ted.

547
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,905
Your tour guide, remember?
-Oh.

548
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:46,839
Hi, Ted.

549
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,174
Oh hi Ted.

550
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,043
If you're feeling hungry,
follow me to the barbecue pit.

551
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:51,911
Yeah.

552
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:52,779
Let's go.

553
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,413
Finally.

554
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:56,115
I'm starving.

555
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,684
This is so awesome.

556
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,557
Who wants a nice
piece of my meat?

557
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,298
I got seven.

558
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,566
One for me.

559
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,903
Ladies, this concludes
the meat service.

560
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,337
Let me get nekkid.

561
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,839
Pretty good, huh, kiddies?

562
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,441
-Disgusting.
-What's the matter, Sandy?

563
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,042
You don't like meat?

564
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,911
Even Mama Bear's eating it and
she's a certified hippy chick.

565
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,714
I'm sure that it's great,
but I'm a vegetarian.

566
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,282
Well I'm a vagetarian
myself, but I tend to eat

567
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,718
Whatever's put in front of me.

568
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,285
And out here in the
Everglades, the law of the land

569
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,087
Is you either eat or be eaten.

570
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,322
What are we eating
tonight, Ted?

571
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,157
Tonight we're
having gator tail.

572
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,291
Really?

573
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,126
Wow.

574
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,160
Got it myself.

575
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,696
And what's our second option?

576
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,197
That is your second option.

577
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:49,035
That's what's known
as it for tonight.

578
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,136
Well thank you, Ted.

579
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,303
It's fresh.

580
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,773
Isn't it illegal
to kill alligators?

581
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,942
Well actually, it's
seasonal, but they

582
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,610
Run around here like rats.

583
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,579
Sorry to change the
subject, but I still

584
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,247
Haven't seen Roselyn all night.

585
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,515
Where could she be?

586
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,150
I told you I saw her
leave with that guy.

587
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,284
She went home.

588
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,419
Get over it.

589
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,320
Or maybe she is
still here making

590
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:11,524
Sweet love to John
under the moonlight

591
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,660
On a private swamp island.

592
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,562
Roselyn really isn't
the type to make

593
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,897
Sweet love under the
moonlight in the swamp

594
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,466
With my ex-boyfriend.

595
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,399
But whatever.

596
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,101
I'll drop it for now.

597
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,202
Can I have some marshmallows?

598
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,203
Of course.

599
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,572
It's S'mores time, ladies.

600
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:27,774
I got marshmallows,
chocolate, help yourself.

601
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,942
If you don't mind, I'm going
to turn into for the evening.

602
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,511
So goodnight.

603
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:32,779
-Goodnight, Ted.
-See you, Ted.

604
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:33,446
Thank you.

605
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:34,447
Have a good night.

606
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:35,347
This is great!

607
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,483
Yeah, Mama Bear.

608
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,416
I'm so happy that I came.

609
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,951
This was a great idea.

610
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:43,022
Who needs men when we have
friends and wide open spaces.

611
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,458
I haven't been out
here since I was a kid.

612
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:48,060
Yeah because college
life doesn't allow

613
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,596
Much time for camping, right?

614
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:53,399
Except for spring break,
summer break, fall break,

615
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,834
Winter break.

616
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:55,968
Oh um--

617
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,038
Easter weekend, Memorial
Day, Columbus weekend.

618
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,206
OK.
Shut up.

619
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,508
I get your point.

620
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,442
I guess I'm just not
much of a nature person.

621
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,278
I come out here all
the time to wrestle

622
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,114
Alligator and trap pythons.

623
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,016
And mate with skunk apes.

624
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:15,221
Oh girl, there may be more
truth to that than you know.

625
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,355
This reminds me
of how I met John.

626
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,657
Really?

627
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,026
I was camping out and
it started raining,

628
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:20,960
And he gave me shelter.

629
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,661
Oh yeah?

630
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,195
Where were you camping?

631
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,865
I was camping out for tickets
to the Florida State game.

632
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,767
And he gave me a
tour of the stadium.

633
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,402
Which ended in the locker
room showers, I'm sure.

634
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:31,237
Yeah.

635
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,471
For you too?

636
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,741
We are talking
about John, right?

637
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,810
As I remember it, we actually
found an orchid growing

638
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,279
In some musty water
pipes despite the fact

639
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,881
That it never seen
the light of day.

640
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,250
Oh how romantic.

641
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,719
I guess all it takes is a
steamy shower and a musty locker

642
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,187
Room for love to grow?

643
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,090
Unfortunately, I soon found
out that sensitive guys

644
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,859
Like John only flower
on the off season,

645
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,127
When they're not footballing.

646
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,530
It's a good thing I
never picked his stamen.

647
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,899
Well, darling, with
pretty petals like those,

648
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,702
I'm sure his stamen
was hard-pressed not

649
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,837
To enter your pistil.

650
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:05,772
Ew.

651
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:06,405
Mama Bear!

652
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,675
Dirty Bear.

653
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:12,912
Honey, I just call
it like I see it.

654
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,246
Ah, this is great.

655
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,282
[Whispering]

656
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,317
Do you hear that?

657
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,185
Hey!

658
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,953
Who's out there?

659
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,822
Hello, ladies.

660
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:23,455
Hello.

661
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,456
My name's Ron.

662
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,925
What are you doing out here?

663
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,595
We are on a females only
self-empowerment camping trip,

664
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:29,562
So you can get out.

665
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,163
Hold on now.

666
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,399
I'll be out of here in just a
minute and you should be too.

667
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,266
Oh yeah?

668
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,568
Why is that?

669
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,704
Every several years
some half-wit tourist

670
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,339
Goes missing out here
in the Everglades.

671
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,473
They say there's a curse.

672
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:42,775
Oh.

673
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,644
I've only ventured this
far out in the swamp

674
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,646
Because I care about
your lives and I saw

675
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,247
You drive in earlier with Ted.

676
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,517
If we were in danger, don't you
think that Ted would tell us?

677
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,552
Ted only cares
about making a buck.

678
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,854
But where is he now?

679
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,756
He left about half an
hour ago to go home.

680
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:59,391
He's hunkered down and
hiding out of sight.

681
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,426
He's no fool.

682
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,393
What are you so scared of?

683
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,695
Why Columbus Day weekend?

684
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,864
Call me superstitious,
but there's a legend

685
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,834
That the angry Seminole
warrior called Coowahchobee

686
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,902
Who is said to haunt this area.

687
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,038
Coowahchobee is the
Seminole name for Panther

688
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,974
And his spirit is said to be
the soul of a real warrior who

689
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,210
Was murdered by the US soldiers
during a truce of the Seminole

690
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,712
War.

691
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,848
It is said that every year
around Columbus Day weekend,

692
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:25,584
He becomes especially volatile
and takes out his revenge

693
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,452
On modern-day Americans.

694
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,553
What?

695
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:28,587
-This guy's crazy.
-Calm down.

696
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,722
I'm not lying.

697
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,590
If you came here
just to scare us,

698
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,592
Then I'm going to knock you
back into the Civil War,

699
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,228
You inbred, hillbilly
motherfucker.

700
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,565
I heard the tale myself from my
brother who was one of the very

701
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:40,900
Few survivors of the attack.

702
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,902
If you want me to
go, I will, but

703
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,938
If you want to hear my story
then shut up and listen.

704
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,974
I grew up a couple of
miles west of here,

705
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:51,043
And when I was eight years old
I wanted to go on a hunting trip

706
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,379
With my brother to the
Seminole reservation

707
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,715
Back lands on
Columbus Day weekend.

708
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:58,951
My father rented out a
cabin not too far from here

709
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,552
That was owned by Ted's mother.

710
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,254
What was that?

711
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,422
I think it was a beaver.

712
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:04,757
Don't worry about it.

713
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,025
Kind of looks like an
Indian burial ground.

714
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,727
My brother brought
his girlfriend,

715
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,829
And even though my father
tried to put an end

716
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,265
To any hanky panky, they were
still able to sneak off to make

717
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,101
Sweet love under the stars.

718
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,269
ALL: Make sweet love
under the moonlight!

719
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,237
Ooh.

720
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,973
On a private swamp island.

721
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,609
And as my brother told
me, he and his girlfriend

722
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,277
Got lost on their way
back to the cabin.

723
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:26,112
[Whispering]

724
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:26,913
Did you hear that?

725
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,515
I think it's Coowahchobee.

726
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:30,349
What's Coowahchobee?

727
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,486
Whatever.

728
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,255
Let's get back to this.

729
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,190
Yeah.

730
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,693
[Whispering]

731
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,333
[Chanting]

732
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,869
[Screaming]

733
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,012
Guys, they're dead!

734
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,213
Val, dad, they're both dead.

735
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,048
They were murdered.

736
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,649
What's up with the blood, dude?

737
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,317
I swear, they were just
murdered by an Indian.

738
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,218
You've gotta see this.
Come on.

739
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:06,986
You've got to come now.

740
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:09,288
Come on.

741
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,322
All right, son.

742
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,791
This is what we're going to do.

743
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,861
Ain't nobody going to believe
that no Seminole warrior

744
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,295
Coowahchobee killed everybody.

745
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,197
So we're going to tell them
a bunch of drug dealers

746
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,299
Did it and you're going
to have to shoot me.

747
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,133
That's crazy.

748
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:21,834
We can't do that.

749
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:22,902
We got no choice, buddy.

750
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:23,535
Come on.

751
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,470
Gotta do it.

752
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,806
Right over there.

753
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,407
Oh, motherfucker!

754
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,910
When we got back home, we
reported the phony crime

755
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,245
To the police and the
police believed my father

756
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,580
When they saw his arm.

757
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,482
My father's plan
worked and nobody

758
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,817
Ever suspected otherwise.

759
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,986
And no harm came to
my brother, but we all

760
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:42,188
Know the truth of what
really happened that night.

761
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:45,191
I fully believe in the
wrath of the Coowahchobee.

762
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,059
And every since this
happened to my family,

763
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,796
I try to warn travelers to
get out of the Everglades

764
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,764
On Columbus Day weekend.

765
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:52,799
Good one, buddy.

766
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,333
You're quite the storyteller.

767
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,170
You should be on the hillbilly
cable access channel 666.

768
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,907
Now, if you don't mind, we've
got some partying to do.

769
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,042
So thank you and goodnight.

770
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,044
You must cancel the
party and go home.

771
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,612
You're such a
party pooper, dude.

772
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,380
I was going to invite you to
come smoke some weed with us,

773
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,282
But now you're just
starting to annoy me.

774
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,384
If you will not leave,
I must stay and protect

775
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,685
You from the Coowahchobee.

776
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,354
We don't need your help.

777
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,757
We're a bunch of angry,
self-empowered bitches

778
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,827
And we can fend for ourselves.

779
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,628
You must listen to me.

780
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:23,830
It's not a joke.

781
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,631
The murders have
affected my own family.

782
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,966
Listen to my words.

783
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,301
Stay out of these swamps
on Columbus Day weekend

784
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,071
Or you will feel the
wrath of the Coowahchobee.

785
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,974
Coowahchobee is the
alligator sunning

786
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,508
Itself on the side of the road.

787
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,112
It is the hawk that swoops
down from the sky for his prey.

788
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,781
He is the panther that will
hunt you like a rabbit.

789
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,851
He is the very water
that will drown

790
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,752
You when you least expect it.

791
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,354
Agh, get him off of me!

792
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,188
Hey!

793
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:49,989
Step back.

794
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,690
Burt Reynolds called, honey.

795
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,293
He needs you back on
the set of Deliverance.

796
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,361
[Banjo noise]

797
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,529
May the good Lord
forgive you of your sins

798
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,464
When you meet Coowahchobee.

799
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,301
Damn fool kids.

800
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,937
They deserve everything
they get for laughing at me.

801
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,607
Whoa.

802
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,843
What kind of sign are you?

803
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,011
Gator, gator.

804
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,279
I got something for you.

805
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,681
Come on out from
wherever you are.

806
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,783
How dare you defy Coowahchobee?

807
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,585
I would never
defy Coowahchobee.

808
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:20,819
What are you talking about?

809
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,389
Coowahchobee hear
you warn them kids.

810
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,723
You break my law.

811
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,425
How Coowahchobee let you
live and fish my water

812
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,127
If you break my law?

813
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,128
Oh please.

814
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,796
Please, Coowahchobee,
don't kill me.

815
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:32,298
I will never tell
another person.

816
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,532
Too late!

817
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,534
You are nothing but a
filthy exploiter of my land.

818
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,536
Now you die!

819
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,139

820
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,517

821
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,790
Hey, baby doll.

822
00:30:58,891 --> 00:30:59,625
Where are you going?

823
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:00,692
Oh hey, Mama Bear.

824
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,094
It's really hot.
I can't sleep.

825
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,829
I'm going to go try to
take a shower to cool off.

826
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,731
Yeah, but Claire,
I'm going to bed soon.

827
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,833
No one's going to be out here
to make sure you're safe.

828
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,535
Mama, there's nothing out here.

829
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,938
You don't know what's out here.

830
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,572
Mama, we're in the
middle of nowhere.

831
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,341
If you've got to
go take a shower,

832
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:19,578
At least take my lucky
knife with you, please.

833
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:20,846
I'm not taking
that stupid thing.

834
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,014
Get back here.

835
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:25,317
Take the knife and scrub-a-dub.

836
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,085
Keep it clean.

837
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:27,886
I'm going to bed soon, baby.

838
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,588
All I want to do is have
sweet dreams about you.

839
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:30,622
I love you, Mama Bear.

840
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,158
I love you too, baby girl.

841
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:32,858
Goodnight.

842
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,993
See you in the morning.

843
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,675
[Screech]

844
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,346
Oh, hello little owl.

845
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:55,447
You're not creepy.

846
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,589
You can play nice, right?

847
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,158
[Screech]

848
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,064

[Screech]

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,709
Oh, it smells.

852
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:24,943
Oh, that's gross.

853
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,345
I guess I'm going
to stink for a week.

854
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,618
[Screech]

855
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,519
Oh, Mama Bear.

856
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,521
You owe us for this one.

857
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,490
You will make fine third
wife for Coowahchobee!

858
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,993

00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,137
Listen, woman!

861
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,904
You will either be my
third wife or you will die!

862
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:53,939
Never!

863
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,241
I will never be your third wife.

864
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:55,874
Never!

865
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,708
Then you will die!

00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,473
[Screech]

867
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:33,745
Rise and shine!

868
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,584
Where are we?

869
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,651
Oh yeah.

870
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,453
Camping.

871
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,354
How'd you all sleep?

872
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,155
Not so great.

873
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,723
What time are we heading back?

874
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,092
Heading back?

875
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,393
You've got the cabin
booked for another night.

876
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,026
Great.

877
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,161
Oh, come on, Sandy.

878
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,829
I was just thinking
since I feel

879
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,099
Like crap and
Roselyn's not here,

880
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,800
We could head back earlier.

881
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,535
We've got lots of
exploring to do.

882
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:57,536
We just got here.

883
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:58,537
Yeah.
You're right.

884
00:33:58,637 --> 00:33:59,471
I'm sorry.

885
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,472
Has anyone seen
Claire or Martha?

886
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,740
Yeah.

887
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,275
Actually, she told me she
was going to wake up early

888
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,377
And go for a walk, so
I might join her later.

889
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,346
I haven't seen Claire
since last night.

890
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:10,749
Maybe that guy
Coowahchobee got her.

891
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:11,783
Or maybe it was Ron.

892
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,651
Ew.

893
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:13,519
Yeah.

894
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,753
Did you say Ron?

895
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,755
Yeah, it creeps me out that
that weirdo was stalking

896
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,090
Around here last night.

897
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,858
He came to the barbecue
after you left and told

898
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,360
Us the legend of Coowahchobee.

899
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,861
Why didn't you
tell us about that?

900
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,731
The legend of Coowahchobee
is just a bunch of rubbish.

901
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,300
Ron was probably talking
like that to scare you girls

902
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,102
Because he thought you
were hot and wanted

903
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,104
To take you home to his house.

904
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,740
Yeah, he did say that it
wasn't safe for us to stay here

905
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,510
And that we should all go
to his house for protection.

906
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,280
He said that they went on
a camping trip years ago

907
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,583
And they never did his
brother's girlfriend's body.

908
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,219
And then his brother
said that a Seminole

909
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,088
Indian warrior
named Coowahchobee

910
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,757
Was responsible for the murder.

911
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,326
That's just unbelievable.

912
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,162
First of all, I've known
Ron most of my life

913
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:58,330
And he doesn't have a brother.

914
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,165
What?

915
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,366
Yeah, I sorta kinda know that.

916
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,567
I've been to his
house time after time.

917
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,769
Truth is Ron's got
a few screws loose

918
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,805
And his own girlfriend
disappeared 20 years ago

919
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,440
Under mysterious circumstances.

920
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,277
He claimed it was due
to drug traffickers.

921
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:12,911
Next time he comes here
and tries to scare you,

922
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,346
I want you all to tell me.

923
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,114
I'm going to go try
and track him down so

924
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,649
He doesn't do that again.
I'm sorry.

925
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:18,550
Aww, thanks Ted.

926
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,951
I appreciate it.

927
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,689
So what do you have planned for
us today on your famous Ted's

928
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,356
Swamp Safari?

929
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,092
Well, there's ATV rides.

930
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,460
There's canoe trips.

931
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,161
All right.

932
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:30,762
There's even air boats.

933
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,998
All within 50 feet of the cabin.

934
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,433
Yay!

935
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:35,567
So I want you to go outside
and take a look around

936
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,068
And really have a good time.
-OK.

937
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,069
Great.
-Thank you.

938
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,605
Thanks.

939
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,573
I think I'm just going to go
meet Martha and take a walk.

940
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,774
Good.

941
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,343
I'm going to go prepare
lunch and look for Claire.

942
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,812
I'll see you guys in
a couple of hours.

943
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:47,879
Bye, Ted.

944
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,947
I'm so excited.
There's--

945
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:49,781
Coowahchobee!

946
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,753
So what do you think
happened to Claire?

947
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:55,987
Nothing.

948
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,689
She just wants to
ruin our camping trip.

949
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,957
I don't know.

950
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:00,792
Do you really think she
would do something like that?

951
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,060
Uh, yeah.

952
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,162
I didn't want her to
come on this trip,

953
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,997
But Mama Bear insisted.

954
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,065
And well, the
truth about Claire,

955
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,136
Though, is she's kind of a slut.

956
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,671
I don't know.

957
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,306
I just think that running off
in the middle of the night

958
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,408
Is a little bit too extreme.

959
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:20,212
Yeah, well Claire is an
extreme pain in the ass.

960
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:21,513
She's probably
out there partying

961
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,182
With some damn rednecks
with no concerns of us.

962
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,117
Stop worrying about her so much.

963
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,453
I don't know.

964
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,888
I just have a really bad
feeling that something

965
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:33,325
Bad must have happened
because Roselyn's missing too.

966
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,127
Ted said he saw a football
player and a skank whore

967
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:37,363
Leave together,
and I guarantee you

968
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:39,731
It was Roselyn and not Carla.

969
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,099
I don't know.

970
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,335
Do you really think Roselyn
would betray Sandy like that?

971
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,003
I wouldn't put it past her.

972
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,239
[Screech]

973
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,509
There's an owl up there?

974
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,343
Strange.

975
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,313
But it's the middle of the day.

976
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,481
I don't know.

977
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:56,748
Call me superstitious,
but I think

978
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,049
We should get out of here.
-Oh, come on.

979
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,084
It's a fucking bird.

980
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,185
It's not going to do anything.

981
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:01,520
All right.

982
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,854
You can stay here, but
I'm getting out of here.

983
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,690
I'm already freaked out
by that nut Ron's story

984
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,259
About Coowah--
whatever his name is.

985
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,761
And then Claire
seems to disappear?

986
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:10,829
I'm getting out of here.

987
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:15,634
You see?

988
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,437
The owl heard you talking
about him and he left.

989
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,138
You feel better now?

990
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,540
Don't worry about anything.

991
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,775
Most of these animals here
are more scared of you

992
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:24,976
Than you are of them.

993
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,844
I know.

994
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:26,845
I just-- whatever.

995
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,515
I just feel weird.

996
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:30,248
OK.

997
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,116
I'm getting out of here.

998
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:31,950
You can say.

999
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,818
Good luck.

1000
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:33,852
Fine.

1001
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:34,820
I'll see you back at the cabin.

1002
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,787
Bye.

1003
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:36,722
Fucking wuss.

1004
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,662
I keep forgetting to bathe.

1005
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,296
Yes.

1006
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,731
This is a bad habit.

1007
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:48,367
I just don't do want to
use that outdoor shower.

1008
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:49,200
You're brave.

1009
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,235
I think it's cool.

1010
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:53,305
It's a good way to get a tan.

1011
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:54,873
So what do you think
happened to Claire?

1012
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:58,243
I'm sure she'll show up this
afternoon with some crazy story

1013
00:37:58,344 --> 00:37:59,378
To tell us all about.

1014
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:00,746
I sure hope so.

1015
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,914
This place is really
starting to creep me out.

1016
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:03,782
I can't wait to leave.

1017
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:04,550
Don't worry.

1018
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,751
We only have one more day.

1019
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,953
Just try to make
the best of it, OK?

1020
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:08,887
OK.

1021
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,221
You're right.

1022
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:11,623
I think I'm going to go
find that canoe trail.

1023
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,859
You didn't have enough
canoeing yesterday?

1024
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,895
Uh yeah, but what else
is there to do here?

1025
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,864
That's true.

1026
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:19,765
That was quick.

1027
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,132
No, I didn't shower yet.

1028
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,869
This is Claire's shower kit
and her towel's back there too.

1029
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:24,770
What?

1030
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,004
That's really weird.

1031
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,839
She must have been in a real
hurry to get out of here

1032
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,275
If she left that there.

1033
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:31,710
Don't worry about it.

1034
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,644
Just have fun.

1035
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,646
Don't even think
about that wench.

1036
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,147
When she gets back
here, I'm going

1037
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,149
To make her real sorry for
trying to scare us so hard.

1038
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,017
OK?

1039
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:39,851
It's working.

1040
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:40,919
Don't let it.

1041
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,388
Just have fun.

1042
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,689
It's going to be OK.

1043
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,956
All right.

1044
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,358
Well, I think I'm going to
go find that canoe trail.

1045
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,325
See you guys later.

1046
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,093
All right.
Bye, honey.

1047
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:48,927
Bye.

1048
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,232
Have a good time.

1049
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,767
Sit down.

1050
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,536
I'm really nervous.

1051
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:58,837
Don't worry, baby girl.

1052
00:38:58,937 --> 00:38:59,671
It's OK.

1053
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,047
Finally some time alone.

1054
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:13,118
I can be free and
one with nature.

1055
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,085
I'm such a dork.

1056
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:09,608
Help!

1057
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,012
Please help me!

1058
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:22,020
[Whispering]

1059
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,128
Hello there.

1060
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,597
Hi.

1061
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:33,231
I've been on the CB radio
looking for your friends,

1062
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,166
But so far I have
not had any luck.

1063
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,334
Are you looking for
something to do?

1064
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,536
What are you doing?

1065
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,070
Well, I've just
finished some handiwork.

1066
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,405
Would you like to take a walk?

1067
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:41,239
Sounds fun.

1068
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,574
OK.

1069
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,176
So how long have
you lived here?

1070
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,978
I was born and raised here.

1071
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,014
My family has owned this
land for generations.

1072
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,550
My great-great-grandfather
was one of the first white men

1073
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,718
To venture this far inland.

1074
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:54,052
It must get lonely out here.

1075
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,487
Have you ever been married?

1076
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:58,056
Yes, I was married once
and that was enough.

1077
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,090
Want to see her picture?

1078
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,925
Sure.

1079
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:05,363
Wow, she's beautiful.

1080
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,465
I married my
childhood sweetheart.

1081
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,569
Her name was Rose.

1082
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,037
She was a Seminole girl.

1083
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,743
Unfortunately, she disappeared
under mysterious circumstances.

1084
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:33,124
What's this cage for?

1085
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:37,428
That's where I keep my larger
prey like bears, panthers,

1086
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,097
And other big pussies.

1087
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,065
[Scream]

1088
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,167
Did you hear that scream?

1089
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,001
Yes I did.

1090
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,040
Hey guys.

1091
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,009
Did you hear that scream?

1092
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:51,710
No

1093
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,111
I didn't hear a scream.

1094
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,445
I could swear I heard a scream.

1095
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,281
Ted heard it too.

1096
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,448
-Yeah, I heard it.
-No.

1097
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:58,917
We didn't hear a scream at all.

1098
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,292
That was Mama Bear
screaming like a little baby.

1099
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,994
Shut up.

1100
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,395
Yes, it was me.

1101
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,131
I got stuck by a
hornet in the shitter!

1102
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:17,435
Ted, there's a reason that
there are walls on outhouses.

1103
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,204
To keep the bugs out.

1104
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:23,942
Unfortunately, out here it's
too warm to put walls on them.

1105
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,811
Have you guys seen
Tonya or Martha?

1106
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:26,945
No.

1107
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,313
I bet they're out in the
woods making the beast

1108
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,181
With two butts, though.

1109
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,449
It's backs, woman!

1110
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,919
The beast with two backs!

1111
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:34,686
Oh, whatever.

1112
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:35,887
No, I'm just kidding.

1113
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,422
I haven't seen them at all.

1114
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,256
Oh my God.

1115
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,124
There's Tonya.

1116
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,058
She's hurt!

1117
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,392
Help her!

1118
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,896
Jesus Christ, what happened?

1119
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:46,865
Are you OK?

1120
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:47,833
Come on, up.

1121
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:48,800
Up, up.

1122
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,434
Ready?

1123
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,236
Let's lift.

1124
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,638
Sit her down.

1125
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:56,241
Sit her down.

1126
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,542
How did this happen?

1127
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:59,010
It looks like something
chewed your leg off.

1128
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,246
I stepped in a
stupid bear trap.

1129
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:02,648
My god.

1130
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:03,882
You should have told me
to look out for them, Ted.

1131
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,784
Listen, if you
wander off the path

1132
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,053
There's no telling what
you're going to find.

1133
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,054
Don't blame it on me.

1134
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:10,488
I've got to eat too.

1135
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,891
My dad is a big time
lawyer and he's not

1136
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:15,026
Going to be happy about this.

1137
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,361
Tonya, calm down.

1138
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,596
It's not his fault.
Where is Martha?

1139
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:19,530
I don't know.

1140
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:21,800
I left her back there.

1141
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,334
I was just so freaked out.

1142
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,303
I kept seeing that owl.

1143
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,038
And I just had to
come back here.

1144
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,174
But please, when she
gets back can we just

1145
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,075
Please get out of here?

1146
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,977
Please.

1147
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:32,811
Calm down.

1148
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,415
You've got to rest.

1149
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,285
We can't leave here with some
of your friends unaccounted for.

1150
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:44,322
Let's bring Tonya into
the cabin so she can rest.

1151
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:45,156
OK.

1152
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:45,857
Come on.

1153
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,558
You're going to be OK.

1154
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,761
Here, let me help you up.

1155
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,203
Come on.

1156
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,371
Come on, sweetie.

1157
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,273
Put your foot on here.

1158
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,475
Sit, sit.

1159
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,310
Sit back.

1160
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,144
Easy.

1161
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:07,445
Let me get a bowl.

1162
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:08,413
Hold on.

1163
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:09,380
Move.

1164
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,717
[Coughing]

1165
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:13,451
MAMA BEAR: Do we have
any water or anything?

1166
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,520
[Chatter]

1167
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,354
Just relax.

1168
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,188
Relax.

1169
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:21,827
Just lean back.

1170
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:24,395
Oh my God, oh my God.

1171
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,263
Sit back.

1172
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,197
It's OK.

1173
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:28,099
We're gonna clean it off.

1174
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,238
Ted, do you have a first
aid kit or something?

1175
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,105
TED: [inaudible]

1176
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:37,642
Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

1177
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:38,476
Don't look.

1178
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:39,577
Just breathe deep.

1179
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,513
Veronica, get me the rags.

1180
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,315
Here you go.

1181
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,150
Calm down.

1182
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:45,851
Just calm down.

1183
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,852
Take deep breaths, OK?

1184
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,256
Get me a wrap.

1185
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,290
OK?

1186
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,859
Just breathe deep, OK, honey?

1187
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,026
That's going to help the pain.

1188
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,895
Is there any gauze in there?

1189
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:57,729
Got it.

1190
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:00,966
Poor

1191
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:01,632
Thing.

1192
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:02,834
Listen.

1193
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,202
Why don't you guys
take it easy here?

1194
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,237
I'll take care of Tonya.

1195
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:07,906
Go ahead and take the
gals and do something

1196
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:09,107
To entertain yourselves.

1197
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,276
I'll fix this and
get her some rest.

1198
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,177
What?

1199
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:12,811
I'll take care of her.

1200
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:14,212
Are you kidding?

1201
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,781
This thing needs a
tourniquet and some stitches.

1202
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,283
I really would like to
stick around and help out.

1203
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,152
Mama Bear, I got this.

1204
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,220
I don't know.

1205
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,255
Mama Bear, can we
please go find Martha?

1206
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,757
I'm really freaking out.

1207
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:26,958
I really don't
want to leave you.

1208
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,960
Tonya, are you going to be OK?

1209
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,661
I want to make sure
you're all right, girl.

1210
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:31,797
This is bad.

1211
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:32,730
I'll be fine.

1212
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:33,698
Thank you.

1213
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:34,665
Come on.

1214
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:35,867
We need to go find Martha.

1215
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:38,236
This is getting
really fucked up, OK?

1216
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:39,237
Go ahead.

1217
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:40,071
I'll survive.

1218
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,541
I got it.

1219
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:44,542
Take it easy.

1220
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:45,376
Take it easy.

1221
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:56,554
Ted, I know this
might sound strange.

1222
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,556
But do you think you could
tell me where you last saw

1223
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:01,026
My friends John and Roselyn?

1224
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:02,093
Why?

1225
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,294
What do you think
you're going to find?

1226
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,162
I don't know.

1227
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,730
Hopefully nothing.

1228
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:06,965
I'm just looking
for some reassurance

1229
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,599
That nothing happened to them.

1230
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,037
I told you the last time I
saw them was at the boat ramp.

1231
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:16,441
You can go down there and check,
but there's nothing there.

1232
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,209
OK, thanks.

1233
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:19,177
I'll be right back.

1234
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,045
OK?

1235
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:23,514
It's OK.

1236
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,851
It's OK.

1237
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:29,855
Please, I'm so hungry.

1238
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:32,123
Anything, please.

1239
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:33,124
Please.

1240
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,359
Hey Rose.

1241
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:38,329
It OK if Coowahchobee feeds
second wife, White Rain?

1242
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:41,299
Coowahchobee think
it's OK with Rose.

1243
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:44,102
According to Seminole law,
Coowahchobee no take second

1244
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:46,137
Wife if he cannot feed her.

1245
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,747
No.

1246
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:57,748
Oh no.

1247
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:59,317
What is that?

1248
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:02,487
Don't you have anything like
a sandwich or something?

1249
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:04,722
Coowahchobee get you sandwich.

1250
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:05,556
OK?

1251
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:20,071
Coowahchobee make
you ham and cheese.

1252
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,140
Our love is like sandwich.

1253
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,773
You are ham.

1254
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:24,042
I am cheese.

1255
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,745
[Screams]

1256
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,447
What is that?

1257
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:30,315
This is disgusting.

1258
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,617
What is this?

1259
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:33,618
What's the matter?

1260
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:35,786
You don't like human fingers?

1261
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,523
A few more days of
fasting, you eat

1262
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:39,958
Anything Coowahchobee give you.

1263
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:46,731
Can you hand-- hand me my
clothes over there please?

1264
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:47,798
Why?

1265
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:48,799
I don't know.

1266
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,070
I'm just so cold.

1267
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,604
Coowahchobee bring you clothes.

1268
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:08,686
Goodbye, squaw.

1269
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,226
[Screech]

1270
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:18,896
Tonya?

1271
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:20,932
[Whispering]

1272
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:22,600
Is that you?

1273
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,202
[Whispering]

1274
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:25,670
You'd better not be
trying to scare me.

1275
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,011
Tonya!

1276
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,280
OK, just because you believe
Ron's story doesn't mean

1277
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,114
I'm going to.

1278
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:41,252
Tonya!

1279
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:41,886
[Whispering]

1280
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:42,887
OK, that's it.

1281
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:44,089
Stop being a jerk.

1282
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,260
[Screech]

1283
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,564
And stop that stupid chanting.

1284
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,034
You will make a fine wife.

1285
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:59,837
Lay down and spread your
oyster for Coowahchobee.

1286
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,106
If you want to
please [inaudible],

1287
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:04,742
Coowahchobee would
grant you a fast death.

1288
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,711
But no, I will let you linger!

1289
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:35,773
I feed your spine to the
hawks of the Everglades!

1290
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,498
Look.

1291
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:01,266
It's that creep, Ron.

1292
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:02,400
I'm going to turn around.

1293
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,704
Calm down, V. He's
got an air boat.

1294
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,073
Yeah, but he's so weird.

1295
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:09,574
Yeah, but we need
to find Martha.

1296
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,742
Maybe he'll give us a ride.

1297
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,710
I've got my knife.

1298
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,811
Don't worry.

1299
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:14,645
OK.

1300
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:15,913
Let's go.

1301
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,415
Well, I'm glad you're here.

1302
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,250
I see you've come
to your senses.

1303
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,418
We need to get out of here.

1304
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,119
Why?

1305
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,387
What happened to you?

1306
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,089
I was attacked by
Coowahchobee last night

1307
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,523
And I saw him kill your friends.

1308
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:26,557
Claire?

1309
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,359
How do we know you
didn't kill Claire?

1310
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:29,794
Ted told us your
story was a lie.

1311
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,229
You don't even have a brother.

1312
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:34,165
I admit that I lied
about having a brother.

1313
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:36,267
But if you knew that
my own girlfriend died,

1314
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,968
It would seem too suspicious.

1315
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,270
But I swear on her
grave that it was

1316
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,206
Coowahchobee that killed her.

1317
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:42,840
Just like he killed
your girlfriend.

1318
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,808
We need to get out of here.

1319
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:45,676
Oh my God.

1320
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,811
It's not safe here.

1321
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,179
We gotta go.

1322
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:50,248
I can get us back to
the highway in this thing

1323
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:51,382
So we can hitch a ride.

1324
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,418
So if you want to
go, hop aboard.

1325
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:54,219
OK.

1326
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,221
Yeah, I think we should go.

1327
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,692
I have to stop here
to pick up extra fuel.

1328
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,962
It'll only take a minute,
so just hang tight.

1329
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:15,233
Look, another owl.

1330
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,702
Do you think it's the
same one we saw yesterday?

1331
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:18,536
No.

1332
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,004
I doubt it.

1333
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:21,005
But it is strange.

1334
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:21,839
Yeah.

1335
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:29,547
Wow.

1336
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,349
What a crazy trip.

1337
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,017
I feel so discombobulated.

1338
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:34,519
I know exactly what you mean.

1339
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,621
It's like our entire world's
turned right upside down.

1340
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:39,490
Imagine, if we
were to die today,

1341
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,825
Would you have any regrets?

1342
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:44,262
Come on.

1343
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:55,440
So you mean like things
you've always wanted to do,

1344
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,674
But have never done before?

1345
00:52:56,774 --> 00:53:00,845
Yeah, like, have you
ever wondered what

1346
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:03,080
It was like to kiss a woman?

1347
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,850
I mean, not just a hello kiss.

1348
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,185
But like really kiss a woman?

1349
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:10,421
Can you keep a secret?

1350
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,256
Yes.

1351
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,231
That was cool.

1352
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:24,235
Nice.

1353
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:27,572
Oh really?

1354
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:52,963
Look, another owl.

1355
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,869
Coowahchobee smell
women in heat!

1356
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:04,509
[Drumming]

1357
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:06,243
What the hell was that?

1358
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:07,278
A tomahawk!

1359
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:09,079
Somebody threw a tomahawk at us!

1360
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,648
Someone threw a tomahawk at us?

1361
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,617
What is this, the Battle
of Little Bighorn?

1362
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:14,218
Do you think that
guy Ron threw it?

1363
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,353
That slimy bastard!

1364
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,688
I'll kill whoever did that!

1365
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:22,327
- Did you throw a tomahawk at us?
- Tomahawk?

1366
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:23,328
What tomahawk?

1367
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:24,595
I don't even own a tomahawk.

1368
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:26,331
What am I going to
do with a tomahawk?

1369
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,865
Scalp us, you crazy bastard!

1370
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:28,899
Scalp you?

1371
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:29,900
Why would I want to scalp you?

1372
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,302
I don't know.

1373
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,837
So that you could possess
our souls or something?

1374
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,373
Or whatever psychopaths who
think that they are Indians

1375
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:37,408
Do with people's hair?

1376
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:38,376
It's Coowahchobee.

1377
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:39,644
He must be here.

1378
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:40,277
Get on the boat.

1379
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:41,679
We're leaving now.

1380
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,048
Man, I ought to smack you
right upside your head.

1381
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:45,383
Were leaving now.

1382
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:47,352
Just don't try anything
stupid, Geronimo!

1383
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:48,218
I'm a Ninja!

1384
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,687
You're not a Ninja!

1385
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,621
I am too!

1386
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:53,290
I studied Ninjutsu
ten years ago!

1387
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:55,593
Both of you shut up
and get on the boat.

1388
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:02,567
How dare you bring
these Conquistadors here?

1389
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:03,834
Coowahchobee kill you all!

1390
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:04,535
No, Coowahchobee!

1391
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,170
Please don't kill us!

1392
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,104
Oh my God!

1393
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:09,740
[Screams]

1394
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,309
You are a disgrace
to the Seminoles!

1395
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,511
Die, traitor!

1396
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,917
[Screaming]

1397
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,721
Coowahchobee like good head!

1398
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:34,819
Fuck, I gotta get out of here.

1399
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:43,628
There's gotta be a freaking
phone in here somewhere.

1400
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:57,775
Please.

1401
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:58,609
Please!

1402
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,615
[Whispering]

1403
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:08,018
I'm getting out of here.

1404
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,991
[Whispering]

1405
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:07,578
Who's your daddy, bitch?

1406
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,284
Coowahchobee give you
shelter and welcome you

1407
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,753
To tribe as wife.

1408
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:18,355
But first, you must sacrifice
your foot to the gods

1409
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,157
So you don't run away.

1410
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:25,329
I won't sacrifice anything
for you, [inaudible] freak.

1411
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,597
The choice is yours.

1412
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:28,198
Either your life or your foot!

1413
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:33,804
Squaw!

1414
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:48,385
Did you lose something?

1415
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,420
No, but I found something.

1416
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,724
I think it might
be Roselyn's phone.

1417
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,860
The last call that was made
on this phone was to 911

1418
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,828
And it was only an hour ago.

1419
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,797
Maybe she's still nearby.

1420
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:01,598
How do you know
it's Roselyn's phone?

1421
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,567
Because she sent me this
message about the chanting.

1422
01:00:03,668 --> 01:00:04,969
This is definitely her phone.

1423
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,503
Well, just because
it's Roselyn's phone

1424
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,140
Doesn't necessarily mean that
she dialed 911 an hour ago.

1425
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,275
It was probably Tonya.

1426
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,542
Have you seen her?

1427
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:13,978
No, I don't know
where Tonya is.

1428
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:15,112
No.

1429
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,948
She's in no condition
to be walking around.

1430
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,917
I'm gong to go look for her.

1431
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:22,352
You stay here and wait
while I look for her.

1432
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,587
OK.
Fine.

1433
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:24,789
But can you please hurry up?

1434
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,705
Slut Carla's a cheerleader.

1435
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,384
If John and Carla
were here, then

1436
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,987
Roselyn was probably here too.

1437
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,634
Hello?

1438
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,236
Hello?

1439
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:49,606
Is anyone here?

1440
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,607
Hello?

1441
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,209
I need help!

1442
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,811
Is anyone home?

1443
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:03,187
Oh my God.

1444
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:04,789
This is Ted's place.

1445
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:10,727
This sure will help
me cover some ground.

1446
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:12,429
Let's see how this baby goes.

1447
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:17,401
Ooh.

1448
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,630
That's a dirty trick!

1449
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,632
Oh, the owl.

1450
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,368
Get out of here, owl!

1451
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,202
Go on!

1452
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,404
Get out!

1453
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:30,674
You will die for consuming
Mother Earth's fossil fuels!

1454
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:31,942
Squaw!

1455
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:33,610
Eat my rubber, you
redskin son of a bitch!

1456
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:50,694
What are you doing?

1457
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,029
You think you can just
paddle out of here?

1458
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:53,931
-Yeah, are you going to stop me?
-No.

1459
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:55,232
But why don't you
go back to the cabin

1460
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,034
And wait while I
go get the others

1461
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:58,368
And we'll all leave together.

1462
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:00,304
You still don't think
that anything is wrong?

1463
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:01,505
Listen, lady.

1464
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,607
Just go back to the cabin
and wait for the others.

1465
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:04,441
No.

1466
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,475
I'm leaving.

1467
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,643
I'm going back to the highway.

1468
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:08,045
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

1469
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:11,381
It's a long way and the
Everglades are dangerous.

1470
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,349
I'll take my chances.

1471
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,258
How did you get out here?

1472
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,493
I took your girlfriend
for a ride in the air boat

1473
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,095
And Coowahchobee attacked us.

1474
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,730
He killed one of the
girls and I don't know

1475
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,132
What happened to the other one.

1476
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:28,798
Let me in.

1477
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:29,799
I know the way out.

1478
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,969
Why should I trust you?

1479
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:33,570
Ted told us your story
was a lie because you

1480
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,905
Don't even have a brother.

1481
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:36,373
Just like I told
your other friends,

1482
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:39,143
Yes I lied about saying
it was my brother.

1483
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:41,311
I didn't want to
seem suspicious,

1484
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:43,780
But it was me who fought
Coowahchobee 20 years ago

1485
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,615
And it was my
girlfriend who died.

1486
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,019
If you want me to die out
here, that's your choice.

1487
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,620
But you may end up
paddling for days.

1488
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,258
And without any knowledge of how
to live off the land out here,

1489
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:56,160
You will die out here as well.

1490
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:56,793
OK.

1491
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:57,827
Just-- just get in.

1492
01:04:57,928 --> 01:04:59,896
Just get me out of here.

1493
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:00,797
Let's go.

1494
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:01,932
Lets get out of here.

1495
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:12,476
Do you hear that?

1496
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:13,978
I think I hear a truck.

1497
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:14,911
We must be near the highway.

1498
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:17,281
Here's dry land.

1499
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,549
[Snake rattle]

1500
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:24,854
That might be a trucker.

1501
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:25,956
He could help us.

1502
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,167
Come on.

1503
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:11,768
There's an SUV halfway
between us and him.

1504
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:13,437
Let's go see if we can hot-wire
it and get out of here quickly.

1505
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:14,671
No way.
I'm going to stay here and hide.

1506
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:15,539
Come on!
Come on!

1507
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:23,347
No!

1508
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:24,181
Come with me!

1509
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,644
All right.

1510
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,247
[Screaming]

1511
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:04,621
Coowahchobee!

1512
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:20,570
[Screaming]

1513
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,359
Sandy, come back.

1514
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,428
Ron is dead.

1515
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:46,130
I caught him with
pictures of my dead wife

1516
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,832
And other Indian artifacts.

1517
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,701
With Ron dead,
Coowahchobee is gone.

1518
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:52,536
Help!

1519
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:53,503
Help!

1520
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:54,471
You're safe.

1521
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:55,872
Come out.

1522
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:57,241
Is that you?

1523
01:07:57,341 --> 01:08:00,210
Help me, I can't hear you!

1524
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,280
I was kidnapped by an
Indian and put in a cage.

1525
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:03,947
Help me!

1526
01:08:04,047 --> 01:08:05,949
You must help me!

1527
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:06,950
Roselyn?

1528
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,319
Roselyn, is that you?

1529
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,921
Roselyn, it's me, Sandy!

1530
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,523
Sandy?

1531
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:16,126
[Scream]

1532
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,896
Roselyn!

1533
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:20,930
Roselyn, help me!

1534
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:24,501
My foot is-- my foot is stuck!

1535
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,469
Sandy!

1536
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:26,470
Is that you?

1537
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:30,474
Roselyn!

1538
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:35,845
Oh my God!

1539
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,447
Where have you been?

1540
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:38,248
Oh my God.

1541
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:40,850
I was so worried about you.

1542
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,219
You saved my life.

1543
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,088
I was kidnapped
by Coowahchobee.

1544
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:49,559
I was put in a cage and
made to be his wife.

1545
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,495
Nobody believed me that
you were in trouble.

1546
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:54,164
They all tried to convince
me that you left with John.

1547
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:58,134
John and Carla are dead.

1548
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,637
[Whispering]

1549
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:05,175
[Screams]

1550
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,748
White Rain gone dry.

1551
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,484
Til death do us part,
as you people say.

1552
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,887
Coowahchobee want a divorce.

1553
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,324
You are so beautiful,
White Rain.

1554
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:23,527
Is it too late to take
Coowahchobee back?

1555
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:26,696
You still owe Coowahchobee
beaver pelt for that dress.

1556
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:29,633
But first I go kill
squirrel that run away.

1557
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:32,202
[Laughter]

1558
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,278
It's that truck.

1559
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:42,145
Oh [inaudible].

1560
01:09:42,246 --> 01:09:42,979
Maybe it's open.

1561
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:49,753
Shit.

1562
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:57,961
Hey you!

1563
01:09:58,061 --> 01:10:00,664
Give me the keys to your truck.

1564
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:03,433
Ted's gonna kill us both if
you don't give me the keys

1565
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,801
And we get out of here.

1566
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:05,802
Listen, bitch!

1567
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:09,138
Give me the keys!

1568
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:10,139
Oh my God.

1569
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,140
Gross.

1570
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:12,476
Oh my God.

1571
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:13,310
Shit.

1572
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,387
[Grunting]

1573
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,923
Stay away from Coowahchobee's
house or Coowahchobee kill you!

1574
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:27,924
He's coming!

1575
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,174
Coowahchobee loves Rose.

1576
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:46,576
Get away from my wife!

1577
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,512
Your wife is burning in Hell!

1578
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:49,145
No!

1579
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,680
Rose, I'll save you!

1580
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,649
Rose, don't die!

1581
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:53,483
Rose!

1582
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,356
I will die with you, Rose.

1583
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:00,957
Coowahchobee love Rose!

1584
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,530
[Screaming]

1585
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:26,883
[Whispering]

1586
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:42,265
Hi sweetie.

1587
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:43,600
Can I get you anything to drink?

1588
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:44,300
Roselyn.

1589
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:45,635
What are you doing here?

1590
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:47,070
I'm sorry, you
must be mistaken.

1591
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,237
My name is Kim.

1592
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:49,205
Oh.

1593
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,407
I'm sorry.

1594
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:52,108
I just mistook you
for an old friend.

1595
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:53,443
No problem.

1596
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:54,744
Do you know when we can
get back in the water?

1597
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:55,612
Hold on one second.

1598
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:56,813
I'll ask our old pool man.

1599
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:57,947
Hey Ted.

1600
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,083
When do you think we can
go back in this water?

1601
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:00,917
The water?

1602
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:04,120
The water is fine!

1603
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,356
[Screams]

1604
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,534
What in tarnation?

1605
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:20,036
I hear monkey business!

1606
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:20,870
Awesome.

1607
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,871
You need that again?

1608
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:22,739
You're good.

1609
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:26,843
Don't move, don't move.

1610
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:33,249
It's warmer right here.

1611
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,117
Did you pee in the water?

1612
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,357
Do you think it's the same one?

1613
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:44,160
You're supposed
to say don't worry.

1614
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,795
You're going backwards.

1615
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:48,097
[Laughter]

1616
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:51,334
Hold on, I can't stop laughing.

1617
01:12:51,435 --> 01:12:53,870
I know one thing
about John's thing.

1618
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:57,907
Wait, wait, wait.

1619
01:12:58,007 --> 01:12:58,842
That was stupid of me.

1620
01:12:58,942 --> 01:12:59,743
That was all right.

1621
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:00,410
Coowahchobee!

1622
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,845

01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:10,319
Love you.

1627
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,289
Take care.
