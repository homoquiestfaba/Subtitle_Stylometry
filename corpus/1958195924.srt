1
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:41,636
Come on, I'm good for it.
Payday's Tuesday.

2
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:48,776
Ha!

3
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,143
You see that, Griz?

4
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,779
Plugged it
right through the middle!

5
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,301
Almost got him.

6
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,524
Whiskey.

7
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,663
Don't get
a lot of strangers
passing through.

8
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,632
Certainly not
pretty ones like you.

9
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,537
Uh, anyone tell you
you're a pretty fine piece?

10
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,577
Girl, are you
hard of hearing
or something?

11
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:00,515
I heard. Go away.

12
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:27,909
You just made the biggest
and last mistake of your life.

13
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,256
Argh!

14
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,009
No one likes
a back-shooter, Tom.

15
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,514
Outside, now.

16
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,988
I apologize for my men.

17
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,860
They can be rough
around the edges.

18
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:24,599
But then again, so is the town.

19
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,267
Perhaps you'd join me
for a drink?

20
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,605
I'll give you the good stuff.

21
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,890
Those were some moves
you had, downstairs.

22
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,859
Never seen anyone
fight like that.

23
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,597
You're a wonder.

24
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,742
How'd you get the face?

25
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,378
By trusting the wrong people.

26
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,949
It's a tale
as old as time itself.

27
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:18,820
Gold is discovered
and everyone is happy.

28
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:22,023
And then greed
shows its ugly face

29
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,724
and ruins everything.

30
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,297
Those so-called
honest townsfolk

31
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,598
took over the bank,

32
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,133
which had
repossessed
their land

33
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,569
for delinquent
interest charges.

34
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,838
Which you did legal, I'm sure.

35
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,371
Now, my judges,

36
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,143
every one said
we was in the right.

37
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,678
But they stole back the gold

38
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,613
they used to pay
for their stakes,

39
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,316
and this cannot stand.

40
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,551
We're a civilized society,

41
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,352
a land of laws.

42
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,357
If this bunch gets their way,
why then, where would we be?

43
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm guessing
you're going to tell me.

44
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,833
There's an opportunity
for you here.

45
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,771
Help me fight
for law and order.

46
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:11,973
Help me--

47
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:17,845
Hyah!

48
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,048
Hyah!

49
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,051
Whoa!

50
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,029
We don't want no trouble.

51
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:37,531
Heading to the depot
for a fresh start.

52
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,438
Huh?

53
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,741
Pa!

54
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,155
No!

55
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:14,869
Ma!

56
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,037
Do it.

57
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,550
Shoot that damn woman.

58
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,193
Kill her!

59
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,801
Open the gate!

60
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,271
Argh!

61
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,206
Argh!

62
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,952
They killed
them both.

63
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,090
I know it's hard.
Now you've got to be brave.

64
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,370
I told 'em
they should sneak off at night,

65
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:59,206
but they didn't want to leave
behind what little they had.

66
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,574
Now they got less.

67
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,877
Bat Lash, you damn fool!

68
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,979
Why you making trouble
with Hex's men?

69
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:08,349
Because sometimes trouble's
got to be made, Sheriff.

70
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,717
What do you care?

71
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:12,119
You don't ranch,
farm, or dig gold.

72
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,455
You don't have
a dog in this fight.

73
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:17,024
And why are you mixing in this?

74
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,894
I'm not. Just passing through.

75
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,731
Supplies would be appreciated.

76
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:27,001
Does it look like
we got extra stuff?

77
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,937
At least give us your name
before you ride off.

78
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,313
They're coming again!

79
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,261
Got a present
for all you stubborn folk.

80
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,009
I hope it sends you to hell.

81
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,945
Shoot the wheels.

82
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:28,195
Hyah!

83
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,410
Oh, my God.

84
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,718
She's an angel.

85
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,286
That's why she's not hurt.

86
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,755
Come to save us all.

87
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:00,060
- Are you okay?
- Okay?

88
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,796
- How are you
not axle grease?

89
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:29,924
I've had a think,

90
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,492
and it may just be easier

91
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,260
to kill you all.

92
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,962
Eat lead.

93
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,362
What the hell are you?

94
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,869
Well, you certainly kicked
that hornet's nest in the face.

95
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,572
Now Hex will kill us all.

96
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,873
He was gonna
do that anyway.

97
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:21,742
She saved us.

98
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,043
Saved us?

99
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,314
We're starving
and dying of thirst here!

100
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,917
I passed a storehouse
on my way in.

101
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:32,386
Plenty of supplies there.

102
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:33,954
Great idea!

103
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,456
Go ask Mr. Hex

104
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:38,560
if'n you could load
a wagon or two of his stuff

105
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:39,860
after blowing him up!

106
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,529
Not a bad idea.

107
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:42,930
The supplies, I mean.

108
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,667
Need a distraction, though.

109
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:49,203
On occasion,
I can be distracting.

110
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,754
My mistake was showing mercy.

111
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,326
I took half measures.

112
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:14,495
No more.

113
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,499
You got something to say?

114
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,336
Well, sir,

115
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,339
that outside, was a goat rope.

116
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:27,007
Oh, it sure was.

117
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,309
And you boys think

118
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,911
you could make
better decisions than me?

119
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,279
That's right.

120
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,886
I ever tell you
about this timepiece?

121
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,956
My great grandfather carried it
through the Revolutionary War.

122
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,527
My grandpappy,
through the War of 1812.

123
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:49,296
My pa had it during
the Mexican-American War.

124
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,366
And I took it through the war
between the states.

125
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,836
Had to hide it for a year
from the Yankee Guards

126
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:58,138
after I was captured at Shiloh.

127
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:00,642
Uncomfortable,

128
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,243
but still keeps the time.

129
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,281
We don't give a damn
about your grandpappy's watch!

130
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,684
Oh...

131
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,786
But you very much should.

132
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,487
You see,

133
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:18,359
my family has always settled
their disputes with this watch.

134
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,495
Now, when the chimes stop,

135
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:28,102
make your move.

136
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:31,265
Been meaning to fix that.

137
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,050
I'll load up.
Need five minutes.

138
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:09,470
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

139
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,972
Throwing your lot in
with a bunch of thieves

140
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,341
doesn't match
your code now,
does it?

141
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:18,613
And realizing that mistake,
here you are.

142
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:20,548
Looks like.

143
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,218
Maybe we could strike a deal.

144
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,490
But of course,
you'd have to convince me.

145
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:35,229
And I'm going to need
both types of convincing.

146
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,700
You think you can handle
being physical with me?

147
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,093
<i>We hijack</i>
<i>the train at Sweetwater,</i>

148
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,295
<i>and load the nitro.</i>

149
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:12,199
<i>We detonate it</i>
<i>by the barricade.</i>

150
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:16,069
<i>It'll vaporize everyone inside</i>

151
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,540
any minute now.

152
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:23,778
Hyah!

153
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:50,605
I got to say,

154
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,105
you're real handy
to have around.

155
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,042
You trust me?

156
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,176
Damn straight, I do.

157
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,612
Get everyone
out of the barricade.

158
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,080
I'm gonna end this
once and for all.

159
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:07,855
Hyah!

160
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:25,873
Argh!

161
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,215
Hurry up,
let's get out of here!

162
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,253
Are you crazy?

163
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,190
You go out there,
you'll get these kids shot.

164
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,026
Sheriff, we've got to leave.

165
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:48,796
The angel's coming back,
and she's coming back angry.

166
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,495
I'm putting in for hazard pay.

167
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:56,430
Look!

168
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:06,107
Since there's, uh,
nothing left to fight over,

169
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:07,441
you could stay.

170
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,342
With us.

171
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,863
Nothing's over until I say.

172
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,330
Ahhh!

173
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:15,743
Would you have stayed?

174
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,458
Welcome to my home.

175
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:09,329
Welcome to Shamballah.

176
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,702
Ugly one, aren't you?

177
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,815
And the prisoners?

178
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,183
To the mines.

179
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,786
Their sword arms will be put
to work swinging picks.

180
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,322
Until the next
mercenary arrives.

181
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,992
We should have killed Deimos
when we had the chance.

182
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,328
I understand your ire, friend.

183
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,097
But we cannot change the past,

184
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,499
only ensure the same mistakes
are not made in the future.

185
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,169
Gather those that are able.

186
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:26,040
We'll strike back,
finish Deimos once and for all.

187
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:30,878
Something funny, slave?

188
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:33,581
Mercenary.

189
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:34,982
There is a difference.

190
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,919
Not from where I'm standing.

191
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,522
You take an army
to the wizard's,

192
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:44,792
your queen might as well
look for another king.

193
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,861
You'll be dead
before you see his face.

194
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,430
And let me guess,
for your freedom,

195
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,533
you'll lead us
to his throne room?

196
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:55,970
No.

197
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:59,140
For my freedom
and a pile of gold.

198
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,146
You give me those,
I'll draw a map to his castle.

199
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,982
Mercenary, remember?

200
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,652
You can't possibly
be considering this.

201
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,087
How can we trust him?

202
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,423
We can't.

203
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,457
That's why he's coming with us.

204
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,927
The hell I will.

205
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:24,231
You want your coin?
You want your freedom?

206
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,934
Then you'll earn it
like the rest of us.

207
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,836
Or you can enjoy
the darkness of the mines

208
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:30,638
until you're old and gray.

209
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,084
Is this necessary?

210
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,720
Be grateful,
it's only one chain.

211
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:47,888
Machiste...

212
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,125
For Skartaris!

213
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,496
Mariah, scout ahead.

214
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,997
It's high time we make camp.

215
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:34,969
It's best to wait for night.

216
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:36,904
Night?

217
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:38,839
The darkness.

218
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,141
You know as well as I,

219
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,676
the sun shines
forever on Skartaris.

220
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:48,716
Yes.

221
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:50,951
Where did you say
you were from, mercenary?

222
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,120
I...

223
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,261
It matters not.

224
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,399
You come to kill a king
with a mercenary horde,

225
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,068
wearing a strange helmet,

226
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:10,004
and yet you don't know
where you're from.

227
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:13,174
I am your prisoner,
not your gossiping harlot.

228
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,779
There's a wooded glade,
an arrow's shot away.

229
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,147
Lead on.

230
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:38,332
Mercenary.

231
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:44,539
How long now?

232
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,474
Across the Desert of Dreams,

233
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:50,044
where men see visions
that are more than visions.

234
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:53,047
Then a short ride
through the Dragon Sea.

235
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:55,216
What can you tell us
about this wizard?

236
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,750
His fortress?

237
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,052
Not much.

238
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,455
Not... Why are you here, then?

239
00:27:01,523 --> 00:27:04,492
I told you, I could
take you to his castle.

240
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,127
Beyond that,

241
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:08,262
you're the ones
intent on dying.

242
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,499
You fear his magic.

243
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:13,901
I don't fear much of anything.

244
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:17,104
Besides, I don't
believe in magic.

245
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,874
What do you believe in?

246
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,077
Steel. Gold.

247
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:25,913
The evil
in the hearts
of all men.

248
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,717
Then you keep poor company.

249
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:32,353
My king is a good man.

250
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:34,955
Do you think so?

251
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,424
Because he fights
for truth and justice?

252
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:39,493
No.

253
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:41,228
All men are evil.

254
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:43,931
He knows as well as I,

255
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:47,501
the darkness
that resides in our souls.

256
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:51,338
Then it is up to us
to stand up to the darkness.

257
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,123
I've seen a jester

258
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,292
slit the throat
of his own king.

259
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:15,129
Men made of ice
steal from the poor,

260
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:17,298
and women more cat than woman

261
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,500
manipulate the just.

262
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:21,503
And no one could stop them.

263
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,039
Because evil
is as unstoppable as the rain.

264
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:29,143
That's why we fight
for those that can't.

265
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,045
A good man knows

266
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:32,980
that the darkness
will always be there,

267
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:36,083
but stands against it anyway.

268
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,888
Unlike mercenary scum like you,
who care only about yourself.

269
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,458
How did you come
to be in his employ?

270
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,461
He found me.

271
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:51,566
He promised me riches
if I would take your head.

272
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,267
And you took it

273
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:56,504
because death is nothing
to a man with no life.

274
00:28:58,205 --> 00:29:00,107
You know nothing about me.

275
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,743
Neither do you.

276
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:10,317
What is it?

277
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,227
To the trees!

278
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,505
Argon and Rapasil.

279
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,475
And you,

280
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,810
you may have saved my life,
but don't think you can escape.

281
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,483
I'm not up here to escape.

282
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:45,085
I'm waiting to see

283
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:46,387
what those creatures
were running from.

284
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:53,394
Like hell.

285
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:39,607
There.
Baroth Mountain.

286
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,254
Hold.

287
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:57,525
What is it?

288
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,259
I'm not sure.

289
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:18,912
To shore!

290
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:23,618
Argh!

291
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,914
The sooner
this cursed quest is over,

292
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,048
the better.

293
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:04,559
It's... It's...

294
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:08,095
It's you, isn't it?

295
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,208
Visions that are not visions.

296
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:51,673
Climb!

297
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:12,159
Here!

298
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:14,354
Mariah.

299
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,101
Something isn't right.

300
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:35,977
What isn't right
is we're taking too long.

301
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:39,446
Every second we waste
is one in which more could die.

302
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:43,283
I'm going in, even if
you're too scared.

303
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,453
Machiste, no!

304
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:58,165
It's hopeless.

305
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:01,468
What good are we
against such magic?

306
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:04,104
Weren't you the one who said
good men stood against evil,

307
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:05,607
despite the odds?

308
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:35,703
What is it?

309
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,858
How did you know?

310
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:58,793
I'm not sure.

311
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:16,470
Run. Run!

312
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:01,849
Give me the key.

313
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:06,020
This is no time! Hurry!

314
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:21,602
You can't.

315
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:24,437
I can.

316
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:26,974
You know the rule
when running from a beast,

317
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,010
be faster than
the man you're with.

318
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,377
Where is Warlord?

319
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,585
Dead.

320
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:20,795
Who are you?

321
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,999
I don't know.

322
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,368
There was a wreck, I think,

323
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:30,071
and then Deimos found me.

324
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,371
Enough chatter!

325
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:33,541
Help us out of here.

326
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,810
We can still kill the wizard,
and save Skartaris.

327
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:39,080
No.

328
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:40,915
I want no part of your quest.

329
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:44,752
Besides, there's no time
to save you.

330
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,655
But there is enough time
to save myself.

331
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:53,895
Ah-ah-ah.

332
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:58,599
You don't want my magic wand
to speak again, do you?

333
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,872
So, you've returned.

334
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:06,774
And your mission?

335
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,243
Completed.

336
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,811
The Warlord is dead.

337
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:15,249
This was your plan all along.

338
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:16,584
Of course.

339
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:19,320
Attack Warlord, lose.

340
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:20,788
Convince the Warlord
to come here

341
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:22,924
where I can kill him myself.

342
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,861
I'll take my payment now.

343
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:33,267
After you fulfill
one small task for me.

344
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:37,104
Do this last thing,
and you will have your riches.

345
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:48,683
Do it, coward.

346
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:51,719
I can't...

347
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:54,021
I won't...

348
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:57,391
let you kill them.

349
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,393
Ah-ha! Yes.

350
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,828
Well, I'm not surprised.

351
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:04,131
Oh, well, one less person
I don't have to pay.

352
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:33,027
I should let you
kill each other.

353
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:34,494
You!

354
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,365
Time to die, wizard.

355
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:40,534
My sentiments exactly.

356
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:16,037
Ugh!

357
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:31,652
Enough!

358
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,091
How dare you!

359
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:40,895
You pathetic mortals think
that I, the great Deimos,

360
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:43,864
would fall so easily?

361
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:47,334
I am more than
mere flesh and blood.

362
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,739
I am magic incarnate.

363
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:55,810
I am the ruler of Skartaris.

364
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:58,712
I am the master of this realm.

365
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,884
I am your death!

366
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:31,812
Can you fight?

367
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:33,247
Free me and find out.

368
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:23,030
I know this.

369
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:25,866
I've been trapped
here for years.

370
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:30,838
My name is Travis Morgan,

371
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:36,310
and I am the Warlord.

372
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,279
Deimos!

373
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,833
I will have
my revenge, Warlord.

374
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,248
My Lord, where is Machiste?

375
00:45:16,618 --> 00:45:17,885
I'm sorry, Mariah.

376
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:22,890
It's over now.

377
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:24,024
We can return home.

378
00:45:27,428 --> 00:45:29,496
I could use
more warriors like you.

379
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:32,299
Come back with us.

380
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,835
No. I need...

381
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,504
To find a way back.

382
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:39,006
Yes.

383
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:41,041
But to where?

384
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:52,186
Home.

385
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:53,120
Come with us.

386
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:54,888
Morgan...

387
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:58,627
No.

388
00:45:58,693 --> 00:46:01,095
This is my home, my people.

389
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:03,531
And I am their king.

390
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:07,935
I need to be here
to protect them from Deimos.

391
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:10,938
Good luck.

392
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,678
Sir? Agent Kent.
Main office sent me.

393
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:51,278
Ah, the new partner.

394
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:52,112
I'm...

395
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,914
Agent Faraday. I know.

396
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,382
Purple Heart in Iwo Jima.

397
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:57,284
Founder of the
Central Bureau of Intelligence.

398
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:59,253
Lead agent during
the Janus Directive incident.

399
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,954
Yeah, I know the resume, son.

400
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,489
I lived it.

401
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:03,924
They really threw you
in the deep end

402
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,060
with your first
assignment, huh?

403
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,861
What did they
tell you about this?

404
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:10,532
At 0700 hours,

405
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:12,866
strange lights were seen
over the town of Grover's Mill.

406
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:16,805
Six witnesses claim they saw
something fall from the sky.

407
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,606
I'm thinking
it's the Russians, sir.

408
00:47:18,673 --> 00:47:19,674
Another Sputnik.

409
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:21,208
It came from space, all right.

410
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:24,912
But think... farther.

411
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:33,621
We've been dispatched here
on behest of Majestic-12,

412
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:36,357
a program that investigates
UFO sightings.

413
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:39,326
This might just qualify.

414
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:41,529
It's up to us
to interrogate the witnesses

415
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:42,896
and find out what happened.

416
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:45,700
Now's the time
to prove yourself.

417
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:50,672
Are you ready to uphold truth,
justice, and the American way,

418
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,606
no matter what?

419
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:54,908
Yes, sir. No matter what.

420
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:59,246
Then get ready
to meet the peanut gallery.

421
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:21,101
Ho there, Officer...

422
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:23,370
Officer Wayne, highway patrol.

423
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,507
Witnesses are inside.

424
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:27,408
Excellent.

425
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:30,210
Officer Wayne,
my partner, Agent Kent.

426
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:33,681
Do I know you?

427
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,584
Let's get started.

428
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:38,919
After you, Officer.

429
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:41,455
Officer?

430
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:43,625
Officer Wayne?

431
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:46,427
Yes, apologies. I was...

432
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:48,630
Never mind.

433
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:49,997
Strange fellow.

434
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:52,966
You all right there, son?

435
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,569
Just dandy, sir.

436
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,278
-Oh, thank God...
-We've been here an hour.

437
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:05,580
-...finally an authority.
-Is it safe to go out there?

438
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,682
Gentlemen, ladies, please.

439
00:49:07,749 --> 00:49:09,249
I'm Agent Kent.

440
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:12,386
And he's here to ask us
about the little green men.

441
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:16,524
This is no joke!
I know what I saw.

442
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:17,926
We all saw it, lady.

443
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:19,359
How long is this going to take?

444
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:21,061
As long as it needs to, sir.

445
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,297
It takes as long as it takes.

446
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:26,601
For Uncle Sam
and his United States, man.

447
00:49:26,668 --> 00:49:29,970
Well, I am happy to stay
as long as the agent needs.

448
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:31,171
I'm not.

449
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:32,272
I've got a tanker
in a snow drift

450
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:33,541
and a route to keep.

451
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,442
But we know
you hit the snowbank.

452
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,846
The pileup's why
we saw the blasted thing.

453
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:39,046
Please, everyone...

454
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,648
You got a problem?

455
00:49:40,715 --> 00:49:43,818
Well, you could have been
driving more carefully, is all.

456
00:49:43,885 --> 00:49:45,854
Lot of nerve you got!

457
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,489
The American government
appreciates your cooperation

458
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:50,023
in this matter.

459
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,559
Isn't that right, Agent Kent?

460
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:53,528
Uh, yes.

461
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:55,295
Please take a seat.

462
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:57,699
Names and occupations,
beginning with...

463
00:49:57,765 --> 00:50:00,501
Potter. Long-haul trucker.

464
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:02,002
Mr. and Mrs. Lang.

465
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:04,739
As of last Tuesday.

466
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:06,541
We're on our honeymoon.

467
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:07,675
Snapper Carr.

468
00:50:07,742 --> 00:50:09,209
Temporary weekend manager!

469
00:50:09,276 --> 00:50:11,980
You're not going
to call the owner, are you?

470
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:14,014
I really need
this gig to work out.

471
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:16,551
Burroughs Ginsburg Kerouac.

472
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:18,953
Occupation, drifter!

473
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,522
All right, Mr. free spirit,

474
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:22,757
want to tell my partner
what you saw?

475
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:24,826
I was hitching down Highway 5.

476
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:28,061
I politely step
onto the shoulder
so people can see me.

477
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:29,129
Ha!

478
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:30,865
That loon jumps out, I brake,

479
00:50:30,932 --> 00:50:34,301
and suddenly I'm in a snowbank
with two cars on my bumper.

480
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:36,905
That's when we hear it.

481
00:50:36,971 --> 00:50:38,773
It was shrill and whistling

482
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,274
like a scream.

483
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,142
Made your teeth vibrate.

484
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:45,780
We look up,
and. Agent, I swear,

485
00:50:45,847 --> 00:50:51,218
overhead was a flying saucer,
like right out of the movies!

486
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:52,820
- Then--
- Bam!

487
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:56,958
It hits something
in the distance.

488
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:58,091
And then...

489
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,661
And then...

490
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,596
And then?

491
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:03,765
This light starts coming
from where it crashed,

492
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:06,066
and it's not right.

493
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:08,335
I've never seen
a light like that.

494
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,338
I never want to see that again.

495
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:12,941
The thing slammed
into the old barn

496
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:14,441
at the end of the road.

497
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:17,144
When we get there,
there's footprints around it.

498
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,147
We figure, hey, someone's hurt.

499
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,716
We split up to look.

500
00:51:21,783 --> 00:51:23,952
I walk around back,

501
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:25,118
and that's when I see it.

502
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,754
We saw it!

503
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,088
My hand to God,

504
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:30,725
it was an alien
running out of that barn.

505
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:32,627
Ask that girl
if you don't believe us.

506
00:51:32,694 --> 00:51:33,728
She saw it, too.

507
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:40,500
Name and occupation, ma'am.

508
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:45,073
I'm sorry. Um...

509
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:47,609
You're asking? Oh, Ms. Prince.

510
00:51:47,675 --> 00:51:49,711
I'm a secretary.
Mainly a typist.

511
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:52,312
I... I was on my way to work
when it all happened.

512
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,848
I...

513
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:54,882
I think...

514
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:56,718
It's all fuzzy.

515
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:58,620
I... I remember
lights in the sky,

516
00:51:59,152 --> 00:52:00,588
but I was alone.

517
00:52:00,655 --> 00:52:02,255
I'm sorry. I must be
in shock from the accident.

518
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:04,124
I don't remember anything

519
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:05,593
until Officer Wayne
brought us here.

520
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,562
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- Psst.

521
00:52:15,003 --> 00:52:16,236
I didn't say this before

522
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,106
because I didn't want
everyone to hear.

523
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:19,540
I was at the counter

524
00:52:19,607 --> 00:52:21,743
when that officer
walks in with the lot of them.

525
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:24,545
Says to wait
for the authorities,

526
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:26,981
but I didn't call the cops,

527
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:29,584
and there's no phone
at the old mill's barn.

528
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:31,819
So, how did he show up so fast?

529
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:36,356
Agent, we all followed
that alien's footprints.

530
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:39,192
But when we got back
to the barn, I counted.

531
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:42,462
There were five sets
of tracks going
into the woods,

532
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,465
and six coming back.

533
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:48,636
Are you saying the alien
might still be in this area?

534
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:51,673
I'm saying the alien...

535
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,174
might be
in this room.

536
00:52:55,275 --> 00:52:57,277
It could've changed its shape.

537
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:58,913
Look like one of us.

538
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,181
Project images into your mind.

539
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,117
Confuse you.

540
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:08,221
Anyone acting odd may not be
who they say they are, man.

541
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:09,557
If I were you,

542
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:11,726
I'd look to anyone
who seems different.

543
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:14,028
Foreign. Strange.

544
00:53:14,095 --> 00:53:15,897
Weird.

545
00:53:15,963 --> 00:53:17,431
Un-American.

546
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:19,199
Not like you and me.

547
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:20,568
And when you find them,

548
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:22,335
you got to take care
of them right away.

549
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:25,305
Or else you'll give them
a foothold into your mind!

550
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:26,674
I think it's her.

551
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:28,442
That cop
showed up out of nowhere.

552
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:29,744
Are you
gonna protect us?

553
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:31,445
Will you
do your job?

554
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:34,481
Agent Kent,
answer the question.

555
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:35,616
Yes.

556
00:53:35,683 --> 00:53:36,884
I... I mean, no.

557
00:53:36,951 --> 00:53:38,285
I mean, I'm...

558
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:40,454
Sir, I'm just trying
to get information, okay?

559
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:44,826
And would you turn
that damn jukebox off?

560
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,527
But it is off.

561
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:20,862
Uh, excuse me.

562
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:22,295
The music.

563
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:23,998
We hear it too.

564
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:25,533
I'm sorry.

565
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,334
I have to ask you to go back
with the other witnesses.

566
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,369
No. Listen to us.

567
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:39,479
What? Wait, what...
What did you...

568
00:54:45,853 --> 00:54:46,821
What was that?

569
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:47,855
Those images...

570
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:49,090
What images?

571
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:51,225
It's like we said!

572
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,392
It's them!

573
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:54,228
Sending visions
into your brain.

574
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:55,563
They're the aliens!

575
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,565
I don't know
what's going on, but--

576
00:54:57,632 --> 00:54:59,299
Don't take a step further!

577
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:01,401
Kent, back away from them.

578
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:03,271
Back away? Kill them!

579
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:05,106
We're not safe
till they're gone!

580
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,109
The music.

581
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:09,243
It's coming from the car.

582
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,344
Damn it,
if you don't act, I will.

583
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,126
How did you do that?

584
00:55:25,193 --> 00:55:27,995
I... I don't know.

585
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:39,339
Your neck!

586
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:43,845
Well, hey, looks like
the alien was me.

587
00:55:58,092 --> 00:55:59,026
He's not human.

588
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:00,995
Holy shit!

589
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:02,462
None of them are human!

590
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,764
Kent, run!

591
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:25,519
How did you...

592
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:28,155
I don't know.
But this feels familiar.

593
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:34,494
Huh.

594
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,497
We have to get out of here.

595
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:15,836
Get in.

596
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:25,846
What is going on?

597
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:27,581
An alien invasion.

598
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:29,150
But what about us?

599
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:32,219
The music,
those images,
they felt like--

600
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,654
Memories.

601
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:35,256
They felt like memories.

602
00:57:35,323 --> 00:57:36,456
That's impossible.

603
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,027
Whatever is going on,

604
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:41,461
we need to get out.

605
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:49,203
Argh!

606
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:11,692
Glove compartment.

607
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:20,434
Flare gun.

608
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,936
Oil tankers
have an exhaust port,

609
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:23,938
which keeps the gas
from sparking an explosion.

610
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:25,873
Damage that, expose it to heat,

611
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,508
and you turn the truck
into a bomb.

612
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:29,043
How do you know all this?

613
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,045
I don't know. I just do.

614
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:38,886
We got one shot.

615
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:40,721
Make it good.

616
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:55,703
Ha-ha! Yes!

617
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:02,777
What the hell is that?

618
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:36,804
Kent!

619
01:00:37,338 --> 01:00:38,205
Thank God,

620
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:41,208
you got out.

621
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:43,677
Faraday?

622
01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:45,880
I knew you'd come.

623
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,815
Smart kid like you
put it together.

624
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:50,284
It started with the UFO,
and here he is...

625
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:53,821
the leader,
the alien head honcho.

626
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:56,390
That one doesn't look
anything like the others.

627
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:57,324
How do you know?

628
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:58,893
Look at it!

629
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:01,495
Even if it's not with them,
it doesn't belong here.

630
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:02,830
You have to kill it.

631
01:01:02,897 --> 01:01:04,732
It's the only way
to stop their invasion.

632
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:08,435
And after you do,

633
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:09,837
we'll put these two down.

634
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,005
What?

635
01:01:11,071 --> 01:01:13,340
No! They're not aliens.

636
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:15,910
The minute they touched you,
you started seeing things.

637
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:18,112
They infected you
with their alien powers.

638
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,414
How else could you hit
that creature across the room?

639
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,318
Tell me I'm wrong!

640
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:26,320
Tell me!

641
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:30,659
You saw those people transform.

642
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:32,726
We can't trust any of them.

643
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:35,196
We have to kill them
before they kill us.

644
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:37,765
You said you wanted
to uphold the American way,

645
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:39,366
to prove yourself.

646
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:43,370
This is the time! Do it!

647
01:01:58,485 --> 01:02:00,321
I don't know what's going on.

648
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,022
I don't know
why I've got these powers,

649
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:04,325
or why I'm seeing those images.

650
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:09,396
But I do know one thing.

651
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:13,133
I am not going to murder people
just because I'm scared.

652
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:16,770
That's not the American way.

653
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:19,940
Oh, my God.

654
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:22,443
You're one of them.

655
01:02:32,253 --> 01:02:33,120
No.

656
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:50,337
He's changing.

657
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:52,439
Everything is.

658
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:20,434
It was all an illusion.

659
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:22,836
Not everything.

660
01:03:23,437 --> 01:03:24,673
We're real.

661
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:25,873
And so is Faraday.

662
01:03:29,843 --> 01:03:31,312
And so is this.

663
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:34,348
You flattened it
with your chest.

664
01:03:34,415 --> 01:03:37,719
I started feeling stronger
as soon as we came in here.

665
01:03:37,786 --> 01:03:39,353
Something about this light...

666
01:03:40,588 --> 01:03:41,556
- this...
- Color.

667
01:03:42,724 --> 01:03:44,291
There was no color outside.

668
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:46,561
None of us even noticed.

669
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:48,763
And the alien leader,

670
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:51,766
it looks like he's more
of a prisoner than we are.

671
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:58,573
He's fighting it.

672
01:03:59,674 --> 01:04:01,041
Whatever the machine is doing.

673
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:42,550
He's being tortured.
Help me get him out of there.

674
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:44,318
We don't have
all the facts here.

675
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:47,321
-For all we know,
this creature is--
-No.

676
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:48,355
Torture is wrong.

677
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:50,057
Period.

678
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:54,254
You've got quite
a grip there, Ms. Prince.

679
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:56,591
I doubt it is "Ms. Prince."

680
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,860
I think this identity
is every bit the illusion

681
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:01,028
that that evil
Martian leader was.

682
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:05,667
Ah, then it worked.

683
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:06,901
You've come at last.

684
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,570
Easy there, fella.

685
01:06:08,636 --> 01:06:10,003
Looks like
you've been
through a lot.

686
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:12,272
On the contrary, Clark,

687
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:15,008
I've put you, all three of you,

688
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:16,276
through a lot.

689
01:06:17,812 --> 01:06:20,047
Bruce. Diana.

690
01:06:20,113 --> 01:06:23,083
Yes, those are your true names.

691
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,953
And I know you well,

692
01:06:25,018 --> 01:06:29,089
for I've lived
inside your minds
for months now,

693
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:31,091
helping create the illusions

694
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:32,259
you've lived.

695
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:34,829
Why?

696
01:06:34,896 --> 01:06:36,698
Not by choice.

697
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:40,200
These machines usurped
my telepathic power,

698
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:44,104
and used it to enslave you
and countless others.

699
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,073
I don't understand any of this.

700
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:47,341
Where on earth are we?

701
01:06:47,942 --> 01:06:49,009
Not Earth,

702
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:51,579
War World.

703
01:06:51,646 --> 01:06:54,682
An immensely ancient
planet-sized weapon

704
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:58,352
that's powered by the hate
and fear of its prisoners,

705
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:01,221
I have been forced
to create realities.

706
01:07:01,288 --> 01:07:04,057
part illusion, part technology,

707
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:06,026
to wrench negative emotions

708
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:08,963
from the poor souls
trapped here.

709
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:10,364
But you helped us.

710
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,200
That music,
drawing each of us here.

711
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:16,436
Yes. After months of searching,

712
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:19,239
I found a back door
in the system.

713
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:22,677
I called to you
the only way I could.

714
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:26,146
It took a dozen lifetimes.

715
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:28,148
But you never gave up.

716
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:32,119
I learned that from you,
as well as courage

717
01:07:32,654 --> 01:07:34,154
and faith.

718
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:37,157
It was time well spent.

719
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:41,495
He's coming! You must hide.

720
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:51,071
Find the zeta chamber.
Escape while you still can.

721
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:52,574
We'll bring you with us.

722
01:07:58,412 --> 01:07:59,647
You called us here to save you.

723
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:01,883
At first, yes.

724
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,918
I thought only of myself.

725
01:08:03,985 --> 01:08:05,653
Having lived in your minds, I--

726
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:17,599
Good night, ladies.

727
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,409
Oh, you three are adorable.

728
01:08:41,022 --> 01:08:42,590
Oh. What?

729
01:09:11,218 --> 01:09:13,387
- They're not dead.
- No.

730
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:17,859
In fact, I think
this one's just being born.

731
01:09:17,925 --> 01:09:20,460
Replacements
for the ones I saw die.

732
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:24,464
They're clones.

733
01:09:24,532 --> 01:09:26,768
Copies of people stolen
over hundreds of years

734
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:30,104
from various worlds,
various realities.

735
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,973
So, we're clones, too?

736
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,373
No.

737
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,743
Many of the prisoners
are originals.

738
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,813
Evidently, they produce
superior hatred and terror.

739
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:44,152
You'd make
a great detective,
Officer Wayne.

740
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:45,318
I doubt it.

741
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:47,922
There's too much I don't know,

742
01:09:47,989 --> 01:09:50,424
like how I even know
how to work this database,

743
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:52,259
or my real name,

744
01:09:53,427 --> 01:09:54,796
or who's watching us.

745
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,666
Yes, I sense that, too.

746
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:00,902
It must be that creature
who attacked us.

747
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:04,505
Hmm. This looks familiar.

748
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:21,288
No escape for you, chump.

749
01:10:22,724 --> 01:10:26,194
Looks like you're gonna get
some one-on-one quality time

750
01:10:26,259 --> 01:10:27,494
with the boss man.

751
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:31,566
Oh, you can say that again.

752
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:34,434
He ain't gonna be too happy
that all of them illusions

753
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:36,938
you've been pumping
into the prisoners' minds

754
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:39,540
are taking a commercial break.

755
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:49,517
No fight left in you.

756
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:52,820
Don't know if you even
need these brain binders.

757
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:57,925
Well, you wanted him.

758
01:10:57,992 --> 01:10:59,627
You got him.

759
01:10:59,694 --> 01:11:01,495
Eh, what's left of him.

760
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:06,000
The last green
Martian in the universe...

761
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:09,302
This universe.

762
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:12,405
What a disappointment you are.

763
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:16,511
Millennia ago,
she called to me,

764
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:18,646
promised me power,

765
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:20,782
and I came.

766
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:26,286
I killed every last Larga here.

767
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,758
But where was the power?

768
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:35,530
Oh, boy, this story again.
It never gets old.

769
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:37,265
Now starts the key part.

770
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,134
We were now one.

771
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:43,871
The most devastating
weapon in the universe,

772
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,874
a planet killer.

773
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:51,478
But where was the key?

774
01:11:52,947 --> 01:11:55,049
Spoiler alert, not here.

775
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,552
Even without it,

776
01:11:57,618 --> 01:12:00,621
we are powerful, eternal...

777
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:05,960
thanks to the unrelenting
terror and violence

778
01:12:06,027 --> 01:12:08,563
of our treasured guests,

779
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,666
But the key,

780
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,571
she whispered to us.

781
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:22,109
It took a dozen jumps
to a dozen more realities

782
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:26,514
before we found
actual living Martians.

783
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:30,885
Thousands of them
in dozens of universes,

784
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:33,054
and still no key.

785
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:39,126
Then, our faithful dog here...

786
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,562
Mercenary. Yeah.

787
01:12:41,629 --> 01:12:44,431
The last
green Martian.

788
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,869
You had no key.

789
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:51,505
You knew of no key.

790
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:52,974
You were useful

791
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:56,443
only as a vision-caster.

792
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:58,679
And now...

793
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:03,718
...even in that,

794
01:13:04,451 --> 01:13:05,753
you fail.

795
01:13:07,188 --> 01:13:11,391
There is but one small service

796
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:14,494
you have yet
to render the War World.

797
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,740
That creature said
you hated guns.

798
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:29,644
Apparently he spoke the truth.

799
01:13:30,945 --> 01:13:34,148
Evidently, I'm very particular
about how I dress.

800
01:13:34,215 --> 01:13:36,083
As I must be, too.

801
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:40,888
I like it.

802
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:43,357
Me, too.

803
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,027
Clark! It's you!

804
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:48,796
I don't know why
I didn't see it before.

805
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:52,366
I... I'm sorry.

806
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:53,901
I still don't remember.

807
01:13:54,802 --> 01:13:57,571
But you're just a baby.

808
01:13:58,606 --> 01:14:01,742
Much too young to be my Clark.

809
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:03,945
There are other
differences, too.

810
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:06,013
I see that now.

811
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,082
Then you're starting
to remember.

812
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:10,117
I remember this.

813
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,152
I remember...

814
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,055
Superman.

815
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:17,658
Other than that,
just flashes of a life.

816
01:14:18,793 --> 01:14:20,194
I remember this room.

817
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:22,697
The zeta chamber.
Can you take us there?

818
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,165
Yes.

819
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:28,169
Louder...

820
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:29,537
...J'onn J'onzz.

821
01:14:31,605 --> 01:14:35,543
All of War World
must hear your cries.

822
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:37,578
Please, don't!

823
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:43,651
And know

824
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:47,487
that there is no hope
for them, either.

825
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,058
On your feet.

826
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,961
It's not as good
if we can't see your face.

827
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,131
He's gonna finish you off, now.

828
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:59,934
I'm gonna let you get
one good shot in.

829
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:02,703
Go out in a blaze of glory.

830
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:03,904
Make it count.

831
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:30,664
I could have just punched him.

832
01:15:31,832 --> 01:15:32,967
I wanted to see if I was right

833
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,702
about what those things
were for.

834
01:15:35,436 --> 01:15:36,570
I was.

835
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:42,043
Yes,

836
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,678
this is how I arrived here.

837
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:48,916
I was bound... with this.

838
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:51,485
It's hard to believe a rope

839
01:15:51,552 --> 01:15:53,254
could hold someone
as strong as you.

840
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,990
I don't think
it's an ordinary rope.

841
01:15:56,057 --> 01:15:58,692
These controls
are surprisingly intuitive.

842
01:15:58,759 --> 01:15:59,960
Where will it take us?

843
01:16:00,027 --> 01:16:01,862
Virtually anywhere
we want to go.

844
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:07,134
Prisoners of War World,
Mongul speaks.

845
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:11,038
Observe this being.

846
01:16:12,373 --> 01:16:14,041
He is stronger than you.

847
01:16:14,842 --> 01:16:17,344
He is wiser than you.

848
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:22,483
Watch him die at our hands.

849
01:16:22,551 --> 01:16:26,954
And know, there is no hope.

850
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:33,894
If we want to leave,
this is the time.

851
01:16:38,466 --> 01:16:39,366
Understand,

852
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:44,004
there's an army of warriors
between us and him.

853
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,175
I'm strangely comfortable
with those odds.

854
01:16:49,243 --> 01:16:51,078
I'd say we've
been in situations

855
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:52,046
like this before.

856
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:55,449
I was just gonna send you guys,

857
01:16:55,517 --> 01:16:56,750
and then go back and save him.

858
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:11,999
So ends
the very last green Martian.

859
01:17:12,066 --> 01:17:13,467
Whoa, that's it?

860
01:17:13,535 --> 01:17:15,503
I thought
you were gonna
say a little more.

861
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:19,006
Because you are useful to us,

862
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:20,274
Lobo,

863
01:17:20,341 --> 01:17:23,844
we give you
a measure of freedom,

864
01:17:23,911 --> 01:17:26,615
- but do not--
- Like...

865
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,150
we thought this
ugly green Martian

866
01:17:29,216 --> 01:17:31,719
would give us
the key to War World

867
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:34,922
so we could actually
fire the damn thing

868
01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:39,727
instead of just
sitting on our ass
for 10,000 years.

869
01:17:41,262 --> 01:17:42,229
Whoa!

870
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:44,331
Uh, just yanking
your chain a little.

871
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:47,301
I'm all about breaking
the awkward tension.

872
01:17:47,368 --> 01:17:52,773
Your screams
will inspire our workers

873
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,443
for decades, fool.

874
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,312
Oh, come on, boss man.

875
01:17:58,379 --> 01:18:00,014
I didn't mean nothing.

876
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,583
I just thought
we needed to stop

877
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,384
and smell the flowers for once.

878
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:06,187
You know, slow things down.

879
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:08,322
Why?

880
01:18:09,558 --> 01:18:10,991
Lord Mongul,

881
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:13,294
there's a disturbance
on level 12, citadel ring.

882
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,830
Another
tedious rebellion.

883
01:18:16,897 --> 01:18:19,634
Send an enforcement detail
to all levels.

884
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:23,337
Reports of a security division
being overwhelmed on level ten.

885
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:24,673
Close battle gates

886
01:18:24,738 --> 01:18:26,941
and scramble
insurrection units.

887
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:29,777
Showing malfunction
on level eight battle gate.

888
01:18:30,612 --> 01:18:31,879
Malfunction?

889
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:35,182
It's been
torn out of its tracks.

890
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:37,484
All communications
lost on level four.

891
01:18:37,552 --> 01:18:39,486
Lower defensive bulkheads.

892
01:18:39,554 --> 01:18:42,223
- Come.
-  -Additional breaches on levels six and seven.

893
01:18:42,289 --> 01:18:45,426
Security divisions
are being overrun.

894
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:47,228
Power outage on level two.

895
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:51,865
Defensive bulkheads
raised by outside force.

896
01:18:51,932 --> 01:18:55,502
Yeah, that'd be
Wonder Woman
or Superman.

897
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:56,837
But not Batman.

898
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:58,472
That would screw up
his lower back.

899
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,508
I had you kill them.

900
01:19:01,676 --> 01:19:02,743
Kill them?

901
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:05,212
I thought you said "Free them."

902
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:08,382
Oh, well, honest mistake.
Could happen to anybody.

903
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:10,884
But I think it's great
we're finally talking.

904
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:18,859
Treachery.

905
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,562
I know, right?

906
01:19:20,629 --> 01:19:22,830
You'd think you could
trust a paid killer,

907
01:19:22,896 --> 01:19:25,199
and not expect
he'd totally try to kill you

908
01:19:25,266 --> 01:19:28,603
and take over the most
badass weapon in the universe.

909
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,804
But, oh, well!

910
01:19:34,808 --> 01:19:35,876
Yeah!

911
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:39,246
Arm yourselves.

912
01:19:50,924 --> 01:19:52,226
There he is.

913
01:19:52,293 --> 01:19:53,762
- At the foot of the leader.
- On it.

914
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:02,936
Kill them.

915
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:15,249
You die now.

916
01:21:19,581 --> 01:21:22,983
Yeah! Don't take no shit
from those Martians!

917
01:21:27,555 --> 01:21:30,324
You can't kill us.

918
01:21:30,391 --> 01:21:36,163
We are linked...
War World and Mongul.

919
01:21:36,798 --> 01:21:38,966
We shall see.

920
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:46,473
What are you doing?
He's still breathing!

921
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:47,509
Frag him!

922
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,144
You owe me that Martian.

923
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:51,912
I put in that back door.

924
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:53,548
I freed you!

925
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:57,117
And who do you think
planted this idea in your mind?

926
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:09,029
The entire planet
is coming through that door.

927
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,964
We can't hold them off
for long.

928
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:12,534
Come with us.

929
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,002
I warned you to escape
while you could, Wonder Woman.

930
01:22:22,677 --> 01:22:23,611
Start.

931
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:33,187
The legend
you heard was true, Mongul.

932
01:22:33,253 --> 01:22:34,823
The Largas did indeed

933
01:22:34,889 --> 01:22:37,625
hide the key
among the Martians.

934
01:22:37,692 --> 01:22:41,128
Mars, locked in
an eternal civil war...

935
01:22:41,195 --> 01:22:44,097
- ...knowing
we would never work together,

936
01:22:44,164 --> 01:22:46,333
the Largas secretly
hid half the key

937
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,803
in the DNA
of the white Martians.

938
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:51,071
The other half in the green.

939
01:22:51,138 --> 01:22:53,106
Neither side knew.

940
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:57,912
No. War World is ours.

941
01:22:57,978 --> 01:23:00,347
Frag you! It's mine!

942
01:23:01,516 --> 01:23:03,150
Until only one Martian

943
01:23:03,217 --> 01:23:04,418
of either race survived.

944
01:23:06,621 --> 01:23:09,557
I am the last of my kind.

945
01:23:09,624 --> 01:23:14,194
Eventually,
you would exterminate
these whites as well.

946
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:15,663
And then you would know.

947
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:21,301
War World is the universe's
ultimate weapon.

948
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,438
You will never wield it.

949
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,709
J'onn, what are you doing?

950
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:10,250
What must be done, Superman.

951
01:24:29,938 --> 01:24:32,040
I don't like the look of this.

952
01:24:32,105 --> 01:24:34,107
A weapon of such horror

953
01:24:34,174 --> 01:24:37,144
must not be allowed
to roam the multiverse

954
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,447
causing endless
death and destruction.

955
01:24:40,515 --> 01:24:43,283
Someday, it may
fall into worse hands

956
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,285
even than Mongul's.

957
01:24:51,593 --> 01:24:54,194
He set War World
to self-destruct.

958
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:57,097
J'onn, you can't.
They're all prisoners...

959
01:24:57,164 --> 01:24:59,767
the people of Skartaris,
even the clones.

960
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:02,436
So I thought
when I arrived.

961
01:25:02,502 --> 01:25:05,372
But I have spent time
in their minds.

962
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:07,174
War World's algorithm

963
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,011
simply gives them
what they think they want,

964
01:25:10,078 --> 01:25:13,881
then leads them deeper
into their hatred and terror.

965
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,321
You will fail.

966
01:25:21,388 --> 01:25:27,095
There is not fear or rage
enough on all War World

967
01:25:27,194 --> 01:25:29,564
to do what you plan.

968
01:25:29,631 --> 01:25:31,298
You are right.

969
01:25:31,365 --> 01:25:34,836
But the richest vein
remains untapped.

970
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:52,787
The zeta chamber!

971
01:25:52,854 --> 01:25:53,788
There's no time.

972
01:26:04,331 --> 01:26:06,466
The three of you are needed.

973
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:09,336
You will come with me. Now.

974
01:26:30,725 --> 01:26:34,162
A handful of lives
on a single planet...

975
01:26:34,261 --> 01:26:35,730
that is nothing

976
01:26:35,797 --> 01:26:39,100
compared to the crisis
that is to come.

977
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:41,334
The absolute annihilation

978
01:26:41,401 --> 01:26:44,739
of everything, everywhere.
