00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,529
<i>you're on the way out.</i>

4
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,527
<i>It's not that last thought</i>

5
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:08,062
<i>or memory or scream.</i>

6
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:17,093
<i>Nah.</i>

7
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,926
<i>Those are the simple deaths,</i>

8
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:21,460
<i>the easy deaths.</i>

9
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:30,000
<i>You might cross a bridge</i>

10
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,325
<i>you might cross a bridge</i>

11
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,225
<i>to somewhere.</i>

12
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:35,325
<i>You might open some door</i>

13
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:36,493
<i>to another room.</i>

14
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,358
<i>But the real death,</i>

15
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,491
<i>the harshest death,</i>

16
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:46,191
<i>is that tiny little dying</i>

17
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:49,157
<i>you do after you're gone,</i>

18
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,324
<i>when your name is spoken by</i>

19
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:51,624
<i>someone else on this earth</i>

20
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,425
<i>for the very last time...</i>

21
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:59,490
<i>When you don't even exist in</i>

22
00:01:59,491 --> 00:01:59,999

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,680
<i>Memory anymore...</i>

24
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:14,922
<i>Which means my death came the</i>

25
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:17,223
<i>day my platoon got back here...</i>

26
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:23,322
<i>With that last handshake from</i>

31
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:40,286
<i>That's when the real death</i>

32
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,321

36

<i>Visit in your sleep.</i>

40
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,218

pulled the pin

on a grenade, threw it

59
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:14,946
in his commander's tent, 101st.

60
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:16,046
That was before the war even

61
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,445
started yet.

62
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:18,445
I'm tellin' ya,

63
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,079
we're our own worst enemy.

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,412
This Hummer misses me by

65
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:22,479
just...

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,045
They like to--we called it

67
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,045
the death blossom,

68
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:26,045
because they would just

69
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:27,011
basically go in a circle

70
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,011
and just start spraying.

71
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:29,011
People start getting

72
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:29,999
into a panic even when nothing's

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,246
into a panic even when nothing's

74
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,245
going on.

75
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,711
You got that shot shy.

76
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:34,045
How about I haven't gotten

77
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,744
a phone call, a letter,

78
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:37,044
an e-mail.

79
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:39,044
I've got nothing

80
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,844
from my chain of command.

81
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:41,977
They don't know whether I'm

82
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:43,010
alive or dead,

83
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:44,110
and you know what?

84
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,376
They don't give a fuck whether

85
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:46,410
I'm alive or dead!

86
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,376
And we have kids,

87
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:50,243
more kids going,

88
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:52,009
killing, "high-tech" killing

89
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,210
now, what's the difference?

90
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,742
It's still killing.

91
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:55,909
I think that the most

92
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,043
important thing is to--

93
00:04:58,044 --> 00:04:59,999
Is to try to assimilate that

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,042
is to try to assimilate that

95
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:04,975
feeling of safety...

96
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:07,042
Outside.

97
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:08,975
Try to take it out of here.

98
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,408
I fought my fucking ass off

99
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,108
in that country for them!

100
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,975
You know that they did?

101
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:16,374
They fucking forgot about me.

102
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,740
They don't give a shit about me!

103
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:20,841
You know that?!

104
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:21,974
Jesus.

105
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:24,007
Good talking.

106
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:28,407
That there is good talking.

107
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:29,840
Thank you fellas, yeah?

108
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:30,000
Until next time.

109
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,374
Until next time.

110
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,840
Seriously, thanks, man.

111
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,272
Thanks, brother.

112
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,105
Well done.

113
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,105
Thank you, staff sergeant.

114
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:45,906
Thanks for that.

115
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,039
What's up, Drake?

116
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:00,000
See, that's was a classic

117
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,271
see, that's was a classic

118
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:02,904
example of opening up,

119
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,270
which is really the whole point

120
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:06,103
here is to open up,

121
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,204
preferably in front of everyone

122
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:10,070
else.

123
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,337
It's part of the group

124
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,571
dynamic.

125
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,603
Come on, Drake. I'm late.

126
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:22,769
Gotta be someplace,

127
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,735
and I got a splitting headache.

128
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,736
I get those, too.

129
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:35,901
Yeah, well, they're nasty.

130
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:39,235
That headache is a, uh,

131
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,568
is an outlet, right?

132
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,734
Because you need an outlet.

133
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:44,868
Yah know, that's--that's--

134
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,201
That's the nature of pain.

135
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:48,201
It expresses itself.

136
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,201
Since you're not voicing it...

137
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:54,067
It keeps me up at night.

138
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:56,934
It's like it's--

139
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,999
Like it's trying to make sure

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,999
I don't forget.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,899
I don't forget.

142
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,266
Well, forget it, 'cause

143
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,766
you're not gonna forget,

144
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,998
like, ever, you know?

145
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:12,832
You're not gonna forget.

146
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,833
You just gotta find your peace.

147
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:26,832
There you go. That's an outlet.

148
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,998
Yeah, why not?

149
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:37,197
That did help.

150
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:38,963
That does feel--do another one.

151
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,964
You're not listening to me.

152
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:49,540
Whoa.

153
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,062
Whoa, big guy.

154
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:57,529
Drake!

155
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,094
Give me a smoke, will ya?

156
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,662
Aahhhhhh!

157
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,929
Drake!

158
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:20,660
Drake!

159
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,928
You're up.

160
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,000
How's cab 902 looking?

161
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:34,793
How's cab 902 looking?

162
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,859
902 it is.

163
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,691
How you doin' there, Drake?

164
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:50,959
You all right?

165
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,524
Um, go make some money

166
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,758
out there, okay?

167
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:11,956
You're cute for a cabbie.

168
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:13,923
You know, if you weren't black,

169
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:16,856
I'd probably fuck you.

170
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,789
I'm not a racist, I just don't

171
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,988
fuck black men anymore.

172
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,656
That leaves us on track for

173
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:23,922
September delivery, which--

174
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:25,588
Which leaves me a satisfied man,

175
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,822
that's right.

176
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:27,788
You know, this pussy's

177
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:29,488
too special for a black dick.

178
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:29,999
You just tell--you tell all your

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,688
you just tell--you tell all your

180
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:32,887
brothers that.

181
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,887

How you doin', cabbie?

188
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:45,953
I just made a $2 million sale.

189
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:49,920
How does that make you feel?

190
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,387
Would you go back

I could tell you how it makes.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,553
I could tell you how it makes

198
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:01,752
me feel.

199
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:02,885
How's that?

200
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:03,785
Like I could

201
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,485
buy and sell you.

202
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:07,752
I'm not even trying

203
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:09,485
to fuck anyone right now.

204
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,518
It's just not worth the drama.

209
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,651
I can't listen to that.

210
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,617
Sorry.

211
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:21,818
You can't listen to what's

212
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,617
going on in the world?

213
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:26,918
I know what's going on.

214
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,883
Sam?

215
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:37,751
Hey, Sam!

216
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,814
Some men were looking for you.

217
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:12,880
Who?

218
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,513
I don't know.

219
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:16,680
They were really serious.

220
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,779
Who were they?

221
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,879
What'd they want?

222
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,913
They knew a lot about you.

223
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,479
I don't know.

224
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,646
You told them which room

225
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:27,646
I was in?

226
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,999
Why'd you do that, Carol?

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,878
Why'd you do that, Carol?

228
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,345
I didn't want to.

229
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:34,379
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,378
Why'd you do that??

231
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:36,412
I'm sorry!

232
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:40,612
Did they take your stuff?

233
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,478
No.

234
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:48,310
They didn't take anything.

235
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:50,377
What'd they want, then?

236
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,877
I don't know.

237
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,477
Tell me what they looked like.

238
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:56,811
They looked serious.

239
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:02,810
See that stare he's got?

240
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,910
I guarantee you he's

241
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,676
seen things that you and I

242
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,476
couldn't even imagine.

243
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,942
But if you were to imagine...

244
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:10,875
Mm-hmm.

245
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,742
I'd say they saw some

246
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:14,575
pretty heavy-duty shit

247
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:15,742
in that little village outside

248
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,576
of fallujah back in '05.

249
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:27,175
Yo, hold up, Drake, Drake!

250
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:29,374
We're the good guys.

251
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:29,999
We work for the company.

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,374
We work for the company.

253
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,340
Come on, get back in the car.

254
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:35,873
I actually admired

255
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:36,940
the initiative you took

256
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:40,773
that day.

257
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:42,807
Thank you.

258
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,773
Why were you at my place?

259
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:46,273
Your place?

260
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:48,306
That motel room?

261
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:50,739
Your place is with us.

262
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,439
Not anymore.

263
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,205
Hey, we never judged you

264
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,772
for anything you did.

265
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:56,772
Give us credit for that,

266
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:57,906
all right?

267
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,504
What I did was a crime.

268
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:05,704
Look, you know what?

269
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:06,738
You are a shining star.

270
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,471
You were the best we had.

271
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:10,204
I mean, answer me this, what is

272
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:11,438
this <i>driving miss Daisy</i>

273
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,604
bullshit?

274
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:14,770
And how does a soldier--

275
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,503
Fuck that, how does any man

276
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,870
resign himself

277
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:19,737
to living in this filth?

278
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:23,437
Because I'm a mercenary,

279
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,702
the filthy kind,

280
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:29,999
the kind your company makes.

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,470
The kind your company makes.

282
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:31,702
Well, this ain't about

283
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:33,502
the company, okay?

284
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:34,836
Right now this is about

285
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:37,436
your men,

286
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:38,636
because something from the past

287
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:40,303
has come back to haunt us.

288
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,736
Let us take you to dinner.

289
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,701
Three days ago,

290
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:50,767
our chief financial officer

291
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,700
was gunned down in the street

292
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,168
in broad daylight.

293
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,434
We have no claim on it.

294
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,768
There's no motive, no suspects.

295
00:13:59,168 --> 00:13:59,999
And then yesterday,

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,066
and then yesterday,

297
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,467
we got a letter from a sergeant

298
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,100
Devon Carter.

299
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:06,566
He's a marine corp sniper.

300
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,233
That name ring a bell?

301
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:09,233
No.

302
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:10,233
Okay,

303
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:11,366
it didn't with us either,

304
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,366
but according

305
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,566
to sergeant Carter,

306
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,765
he was in the village that day,

307
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,833
and he saw everything go down.

308
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,132
That's not possible.

309
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,265
It was just us.

310
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:35,564
Well, apparently not.

311
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:37,731
And apparently this has been

312
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:39,564
eating at the good sergeant's

313
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:41,297
conscience for quite some time

314
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,697
now.

315
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,431
And somehow, killing my c.F.O.

316
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,363
Is a remedy for something,

317
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,497
I don't know.

318
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:54,296
He killed him?

319
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:55,296
That's what it says

320
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:56,230
in the letter.

321
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:06,429
What the fuck?

322
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,395
Seems he was on a mission

323
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,728
we didn't know about to take out

324
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:13,262
a target in that village.

325
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,995
Had a bird's-eye view of the

326
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:16,694
whole square when your squad

327
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:20,027
pulled into town for clean-up.

328
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:22,060
Didn't like what he saw.

329
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:25,294
Now...

330
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:26,427
He wants to tell people

331
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:29,999
about it.

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,327
About it.

333
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:31,693
Now we haven't given

334
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:33,560
the letter to the cops.

335
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,593
I'm sure you understand we

336
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:36,160
prefer to keep this

337
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:37,394
to ourselves.

338
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,392
What does he want?

339
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:47,260
See, that's the thing.

340
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,291
He wants to talk to you.

341
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,725
All right,

342
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:58,124
here is your chicken,

343
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,999
and there's your steak.

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,225
And there's your steak.

345
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,225
Anything else for you today?

346
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,590
What does he want me for?

347
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,023
We don't know.

348
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:13,290
But what we do know

349
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,290
is that you're the only one who

350
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,389
can help us resolve this

351
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,390
for good.

352
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:26,022
You mean kill him.

353
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:29,989
We mean resolve.

354
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, well, I'm not

355
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,588
yeah, well, I'm not

356
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,023
resolving anything.

357
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:38,256
This is your dirty laundry.

358
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,521
Drake, you were the one

359
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,521
giving the orders that day,

360
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:46,654
so I'm sure he's gonna name

361
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:48,454
you first,

362
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:49,554
and I'm sure that's why he's

363
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:51,287
calling you out,

364
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:52,521
so the least you could do

365
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:53,586
for yourself, the very least

366
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,254
you could do for your men,

367
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,386
who are out there right now,

368
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:57,887
trying to lead some semblance of

369
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,386
an ordinary life.

370
00:16:59,387 --> 00:16:59,999
Don't fuck them.

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,386
Don't fuck them.

372
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:05,386
Look,

373
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,452
everything you need

374
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:09,420
is right in there.

375
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:31,565
Go to hell.

376
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,417
Hey, Drake.

377
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:43,584
Hold up a sec.

378
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:53,349
Hey, you remember Ron linin?

379
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,482
What'd it take,

380
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:55,549
about three weeks

381
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,549
before he hung himself?

382
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,815
What about Tyson?

383
00:17:58,816 --> 00:17:59,999
Jumping off that bridge in the

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,216
jumping off that bridge in the

385
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:02,015
middle of rush-hour traffic?

386
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,015
He even killed that

387
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:06,114
woman on the way down.

388
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:07,114
Are you sure you want this

389
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:09,281
to resurface?

390
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:10,281
Don't leave your men

391
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:12,182
out to dry again, lieutenant.

392
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:26,247
I'm not saying yes

393
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,813
to anything.

394
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:29,813
We're confident you'll

395
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:30,000
come to the right conclusion.

396
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,979
Come to the right conclusion.

397
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,212
This is about saving lives,

398
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:33,945
so stop that shit in your head.

399
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,246
Be ready in 48 hours, okay?

400
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:39,147
You ever kill anyone?

401
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,345
I sign the mission orders.

402
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,546
Nobody gets a pass.

403
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,811
I hear they call you

404
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:55,278
"the fireman."

405
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,475
<i>A child grows up,</i>

406
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,877
<i>faces some difficulties...</i>

<i>Sees that where he's going,</i>

408
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:26,975
<i>he's not gonna see the light.</i>

409
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:29,275
<i>So he goes in the direction</i>

410
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:29,999
<i>that it ain't so dark,</i>

411
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,474
<i>that it ain't so dark,</i>

412
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,475
<i>where he's got a chance.</i>

00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,409
<i>We call that intelligence...</i>

414
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,274
<i>Awareness...</i>

415
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,474
<i>Consciousness...</i>

416
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:50,807
<i>Character.</i>

417
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,999
<i>A tree grows from a sapling.</i>

418
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,773
<i>A tree grows from a sapling.</i>

419
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:02,372
<i>It looks up and sees</i>

420
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:03,772
<i>the direction it's going,</i>

421
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:05,306
<i>it won't get any sunlight...</i>

422
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,006
<i>So it changes course...</i>

423
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:13,838
<i>Maybe just a few feet</i>

424
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,371
<i>to the left,</i>

00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:18,271
<i>finds a hole in the canopy</i>

426
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:20,339
<i>where the sun is and thrives.</i>

427
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:24,971
<i>But we don't call that</i>

428
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,204
<i>intelligence.</i>

429
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:29,999
<i>Somehow it's not awareness,</i>

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,203
<i>somehow it's not awareness,</i>

431
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:33,903
<i>has no character.</i>

432
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:37,703
<i>We call that biology,</i>

433
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,669
<i>science,</i>

434
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,169
<i>some magical accident,</i>

435
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,236
<i>but not...</i>

436
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:47,802
<i>Intelligence.</i>

437
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,635
<i>We hold on to that</i>

00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:51,668
<i>for ourselves,</i>

00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,834

440
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,801
<i>But nah.</i>

441
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,868
<i>The thing that separates us men</i>

442
00:20:58,869 --> 00:20:59,999
<i>from beast ain't</i>

443
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,335
<i>from beast ain't</i>

444
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:03,801
<i>intelligence.</i>

445
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:06,268
<i>It's our lack of humility.</i>

446
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,800
<i>Walk around this city</i>

447
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:12,933
<i>and pretend it ain't</i>

448
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,101
<i>just a wilderness.</i>

449
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,899
<i>Scream at the life around you,</i>

<i>just a prison...</i>

452
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:29,999
<i>Counting up,</i>

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,632
<i>counting up,</i>

<i>losing track of all your</i>

455
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,199
<i>mistakes...</i>

456
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,698
<i>Flying around in your mind</i>

457
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:39,866
<i>like birds...</i>

458
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:46,765
<i>And darkening up your sky.</i>

459
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:11,782
You're in my chair.

460
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,523
Sorry to wake you up.

461
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,490
That's all right.

462
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,490
I was already awake,

463
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:23,591
sort of.

464
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:30,000
It's not the hour I mind.

465
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,522
It's not the hour I mind.

466
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,455
That's why I give you guys keys,

467
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,856
so you can come down here

468
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:39,689
anytime you need.

469
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,821
What I do mind is that

470
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,821
you bring me down here

471
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:46,755
and you can't look me in the eye

472
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,189
and tell me what's going on.

473
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,854
I won't be at group...

474
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:07,587
For a little.

475
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:10,719
Okay.

476
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,452
That's all.

477
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,719
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,819
I just won't be here.

479
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,886
Yeah, I got that.

480
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,786
Could anyone have done...

481
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:33,851
Could anyone have done what?

482
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:37,450
Could anyone have done

483
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:40,984
any better?

484
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,385
Done any better with what?

485
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:50,617
What makes what I did wrong?

486
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:55,616
I mean,

487
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:58,583
it was wrong,

488
00:24:58,584 --> 00:24:59,583
but...

489
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:00,000
Look, there's nothing right

490
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:00,849
look, there's nothing right

491
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,515
about what they asked us to do.

492
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:05,015
You gotta remember that.

493
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:09,014
I did bad things, marsh,

494
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:11,714
really bad things.

495
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,848
We did what we were told.

496
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:16,915
Don't make us bad people.

497
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:22,481
Nobody asked us to like it.

498
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:25,013
Then what?

499
00:25:25,014 --> 00:25:27,980
What do we do with those things?

500
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,980
We live with it.

501
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:30,000
We live with ourselves.

502
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:31,847
We live with ourselves.

503
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:33,813
We make peace with the fact that

504
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:35,813
we did the best we could with

505
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:36,813
the training we had.

506
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,779
The war is over, Drake,

507
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,746
and you gotta stop fighting.

508
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,579
That's what I keep telling all

509
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,845
you guys, is that you're home

510
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:54,745
now, and you just gotta stop.

511
00:25:54,746 --> 00:25:56,846
You just gotta.

512
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:04,676
This is 15 miles of river

513
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:06,005
from the target, and we're

514
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:07,306
two days from the river.

515
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:08,605
It'll give you some time

516
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:09,705
to meditate on the stakes

517
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:10,872
at hand, lieutenant.

518
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,705
When you hit the water,

519
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:13,739
there'll be a small boat launch

520
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,205
about a mile or so down,

521
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:16,805
an old forest service thing.

522
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:17,805
Find something there

523
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:18,971
to get you down the river.

524
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,738
Fuck this.

525
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,838
Oh, one more thing,

526
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,838
lieutenant,

527
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,738
and this is from the top.

528
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:26,604
Not a goddamn trace.

529
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,938
And bring proof.

530
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:29,999
Not a goddamn trace, lieutenant.

531
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,705
Not a goddamn trace, lieutenant.

532
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,024
<i>This world's got</i>

533
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:20,358
<i>a darkness to it,</i>

534
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,757
<i>got a nasty stench</i>

535
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:25,757
<i>that follows it around,</i>

536
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:26,690
<i>got a hopelessness,</i>

537
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,790
<i>in its rule book,</i>

538
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,999
<i>talking about how no one here</i>

539
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,657
<i>talking about how no one here</i>

540
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:34,023
<i>gets out alive.</i>

541
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:36,123
<i>So seems like everyone here</i>

542
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:38,689
<i>just stays inside instead,</i>

543
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,122
<i>going mad.</i>

544
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:43,689
<i>No one sees it,</i>

545
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,755
<i>but then they send you away,</i>

546
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:49,022
<i>over there,</i>

547
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:51,122
<i>out there,</i>

548
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:53,755
<i>out of here.</i>

549
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:56,621
<i>And you come back,</i>

550
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,987
<i>if you come back,</i>

551
00:30:58,988 --> 00:30:59,987
<i>you see everyone's</i>

552
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:00,000
<i>out of their damn minds.</i>

553
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:01,755
<i>Out of their damn minds.</i>

554
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:08,953
<i>And they call you the crazy one</i>

555
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,321
<i>for what you did over there.</i>

556
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:11,215
Ah, shit!

557
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:13,415
Oh, fuck!

558
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,916
Oh.

559
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:32,647
Forest?!

560
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,347
What kind of man fights

561
00:32:34,348 --> 00:32:35,347
in anything

562
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:37,613
but the motherfuckin' desert?

563
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:39,648
Ah, shit!

564
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:24,879
Ahh!

565
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,078
Damn it, stop movin'.

566
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:43,375
You're the one who called me

567
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:45,342
out here, asshole!

568
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:46,342
And you're holding out

569
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:48,042
for motherfuckin' hide-and-seek.

570
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:19,439
Is that you, Carter?

571
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,439
Yeah, that's right.

572
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,239
How you doing, Drake?

573
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,038
You know what I told 'em

574
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,999
when they came to me for this?

575
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,805
When they came to me for this?

576
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:31,805
Told 'em I'm too old

577
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,137
for this shit.

578
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,037
Yeah, you were

579
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,904
probably right.

580
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:38,338
Now listen,

581
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:39,404
with your left hand,

582
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:40,904
take hold of your rifle,

583
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,403
with your right,

584
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:43,403
grab the pistol

585
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:45,170
and put them both on the ground,

586
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:47,936
slowly.

587
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:49,969
You got me.

588
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,070
I called bullshit on this

589
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:52,070
from the beginning.

590
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,903
No bullshit about it.

591
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,369
We got a lot to talk about,

592
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:59,169
you and me.

593
00:34:59,170 --> 00:34:59,999
Just put the guns on the ground.

594
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,769
Just put the guns on the ground.

595
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,002
I'm not gonna kill you.

596
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,335
Well, those two guns

597
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:09,468
you're holdin' say differently,

598
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:11,002
and I will kill you if you don't

599
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:13,802
put them on the ground now.

600
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:30,000
Good.

601
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,300
Good.

602
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,933
Now turn around,

603
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:36,867
slowly.

604
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:48,398
Drop the pack.

605
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:50,865
Don't be defiant.

606
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:52,932
Drop the pack.

607
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:06,031
Lieutenant Drake.

608
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:10,130
You're a little taller

609
00:36:10,131 --> 00:36:11,397
in person.

610
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:21,029
So you got some kind

611
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,063
of grudge, right?

612
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,129
What the fuck do I have

613
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,862
to do with your grudge?

614
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:27,195
I don't even know you.

615
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:28,729
Oh, we met

616
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,999
from 1,000 yards away,

617
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,063
from 1,000 yards away,

618
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,329
but I saw you.

619
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,395
You didn't see shit.

620
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,795
I saw you through my glass,

621
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,294
me and my scout,

622
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,895
my buddy binder,

623
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,261
met you over there,

624
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:41,728
rounding up all those villagers

625
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,094
in the square.

626
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:44,361
Yeah, well I never met you.

627
00:36:44,362 --> 00:36:46,727
Slow down.

628
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:48,794
Why don't you fuck yourself

629
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:50,027
and tell me what your goddamn

630
00:36:50,028 --> 00:36:51,293
problem is?

631
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:53,794
You were busy.

632
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,126
Whole time,

633
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,126
you didn't look human.

634
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:57,126
Something had you.

635
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,593
How were you in the perimeter

636
00:36:58,594 --> 00:36:59,659
and we didn't know anything

637
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,000
about you?

638
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:00,726
About you?

639
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:01,726
I was like a bird,

640
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:02,893
had a real nice nest, too,

641
00:37:02,894 --> 00:37:04,259
had a target that was probably

642
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,726
the same man you were looking

643
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:06,992
for, only I actually had the

644
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,726
intel to know where he was.

645
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,658
There was a warehouse pumping

646
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:12,758
out I.E.D.S,

647
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:13,958
so they sent me in to weed out

648
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,025
the one running it,

649
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,558
and I had him cornered,

650
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,958
finally,

651
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,091
until you motherfuckers showed

652
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:20,091
up and just killed

653
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:21,824
everything in sight,

654
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:22,824
except, of course,

655
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:23,824
for the target.

656
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,991
We got ambushed!

657
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:27,824
They were hiding the perps!

658
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:28,824
And I was solving

659
00:37:28,825 --> 00:37:29,824
the problem.

660
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:30,000
What the hell do you want

661
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:30,991
what the hell do you want

662
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:32,257
about it now?

663
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:33,757
What do I want?

664
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:35,856
Well, me and binder watched when

665
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:36,923
you lit that poor bastard

666
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,990
on fire.

667
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,190
Coldest shit I've ever seen.

668
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:43,057
And the whole time your head's

669
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:45,189
right in my crosshairs.

670
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,589
Binder's giving me readings and

671
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,955
we're both thinking this piece

672
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:49,089
of shit deserves to die

673
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,022
right now.

674
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:52,822
Couldn't believe you.

675
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:54,555
What kind of soldier does shit

676
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:56,155
like that?!

677
00:37:56,156 --> 00:37:57,955
I had my finger on the trigger,

678
00:37:57,956 --> 00:37:59,288
ready to pull,

679
00:37:59,289 --> 00:37:59,999
but I didn't,

680
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,555
but I didn't,

681
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:01,721
couldn't.

682
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:03,088
But right in that moment,

683
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:04,221
lieutenant, with you in my

684
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:05,688
sights, I got real on something,

685
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:07,954
that this shit isn't about you

686
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:09,154
or me.

687
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,521
They make us this way.

688
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,754
They're the ones that deserve

689
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:13,853
to get it.

690
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:15,587
No one needs to get it.

691
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:16,853
Don't tell me you didn't

692
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:18,187
deserve to die that day.

693
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:19,720
It's not about deserving it.

694
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:20,720
Mm.

695
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:21,953
You still came for me, though.

696
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:23,119
I told you,

697
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,219
I'm not gonna kill you.

698
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,553
No.

699
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,087
You're not.

700
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,585
You do what you have to do.

701
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:35,552
And if it's gonna come anyway,

702
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:37,118
why don't you get on killing me?

703
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,552
You were on the street for what,

704
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:39,619
a year, after five years of

705
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,085
combat?

706
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,485
Barely scraping by now, right?

707
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,085
Like so many of our brothers.

708
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:45,152
What do you suppose is left

709
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:46,851
for me to kill?

710
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:48,985
You see, what's a bullet

711
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,618
to your head gonna do

712
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,152
but save you, brother?

713
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:49,813
You live here?

714
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:52,680
Yeah.

715
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,013
Like it?

716
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,812
Don't worry.

717
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,879
It's just the elevation

718
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,000
fucking with you.

719
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:00,845
Fucking with you.

720
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:02,047
Ugh.

721
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:07,378
You get used to it.

722
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:08,945
Here.

723
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:23,611
Ahh.

724
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:24,810
Ugh.

725
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:25,943
Thanks.

726
00:40:25,944 --> 00:40:27,144
You're welcome.

727
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:29,611
Mi casa, su casa.

728
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,810
What the hell are you

729
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:34,510
doing up here?

730
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:36,043
What is this place?

731
00:40:36,044 --> 00:40:37,043
Used to be

732
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:38,509
a fire-watch cabin.

733
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,509
Paid men to come up here

734
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,842
and pay attention.

735
00:40:40,843 --> 00:40:42,842
Guess I'm continuing

736
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,909
a tradition, then.

737
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,108
Next time,

738
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,409
keep me out of it.

739
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,642
I would've asked the same

740
00:40:48,643 --> 00:40:50,375
of you in that village.

741
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:51,641
Fuck you.

742
00:40:51,642 --> 00:40:52,641
Drake, I don't have

743
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:53,775
a grudge against you,

744
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:55,075
not at all.

745
00:40:55,076 --> 00:40:57,408
And the executive?

746
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:58,940
I did have a grudge

747
00:40:58,941 --> 00:40:59,999
against him,

748
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,475
against him,

749
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:01,807
and that's what you'd look like

750
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:02,874
if I didn't consider you

751
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,974
a friend.

752
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,007
I feel like we've known

753
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,808
each other for a long time.

754
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:12,373
I want you to join me.

755
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:14,806
I want us to work together.

756
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,639
We can do great things,

757
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,307
you and me.

758
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:19,939
I'm not the man for the job.

759
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,306
Don't you fuck with me.

760
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:23,506
You know I've seen what

761
00:41:23,507 --> 00:41:24,972
your capable of.

762
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:26,372
What I'm capable of

763
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:28,039
is bullshit.

764
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,999
This is bullshit!

765
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,638
This is bullshit!

766
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,505
What the fuck

767
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:33,905
do you want from me?

768
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:35,405
I'm paying my dues.

769
00:41:35,406 --> 00:41:36,538
I don't gotta answer

770
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:37,638
to this shit from you!

771
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,904
Look at you.

772
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:40,904
This is how they make us suffer.

773
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:42,505
We gotta put an end

774
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:43,537
to this shit, Drake.

775
00:41:43,538 --> 00:41:44,570
You're out

776
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,671
of your fuckin' mind.

777
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:46,771
You drag me out here

778
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:47,904
to this shit hole to what?

779
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,304
To play out some little game?

780
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:50,370
Yes!

781
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:51,903
Exactly.

782
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:52,903
It's been a game from the

783
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:54,437
beginning, but up until now,

784
00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:55,903
we've been the pawns.

785
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:58,503
Shit, Carter.

786
00:41:58,504 --> 00:41:59,999
You think we're ever gonna be

787
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,370
you think we're ever gonna be

788
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:01,403
anything but a bunch

789
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:03,770
of fuckin' pawns?

790
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,437
That's in the job description.

791
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:40,433
You have me, Carter!

792
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:44,400
What's your play?

793
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:46,632
What's it gonna be?

794
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:49,465
My play?

795
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,767
Well...

796
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:58,332
I'm gonna cut your ropes.

797
00:42:58,333 --> 00:42:59,999
But if you try to escape,

798
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,331
but if you try to escape,

799
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,831
I will kill you,

800
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,364
and when I do, you'll be

801
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:07,631
thinking about this moment right

802
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:09,364
now, and I won't even have to

803
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:10,499
say "I told you so."

804
00:43:16,298 --> 00:43:18,764
Besides...

805
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:20,330
There's something you and I

806
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,463
have to do right now,

807
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:22,463
and I wouldn't feel right

808
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:24,397
doing it with such an advantage.

809
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:25,663
See what we have to do is clear

810
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:27,663
the air a little bit.

811
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:29,397
Now don't try anything tricky.

812
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,262
Aah!

813
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:35,728
My buddy binder took it

814
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:37,195
pretty hard witnessing

815
00:43:37,196 --> 00:43:38,462
your little outrage over there.

816
00:43:38,463 --> 00:43:39,595
Motherfucker!

817
00:43:39,596 --> 00:43:41,195
So call that one for him.

818
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:42,762
Aah!

819
00:43:42,763 --> 00:43:44,595
And that's for my target in

820
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:46,361
that village that you

821
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:47,628
compromised and fucked up

822
00:43:47,629 --> 00:43:50,627
my percentage.

823
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,494
And that...

824
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:53,761
Well, that's just to make sure

825
00:43:53,762 --> 00:43:55,460
you get it back.

826
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:57,193
You know, you almost got me

827
00:43:57,194 --> 00:43:58,627
in that clear-cut, Drake!

828
00:43:58,628 --> 00:43:59,794
Those bullets were whizzing

829
00:43:59,795 --> 00:44:00,000
right over my head!

830
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:01,793
Right over my head!

831
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:03,460
My good luck, I guess,

832
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:04,626
your bad, 'cause, well,

833
00:44:04,627 --> 00:44:05,661
here we are.

834
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:33,724
You ain't gonna shoot...

835
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:35,491
You aren't gonna--

836
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:36,591
You ain't gonna shoot me,

837
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:37,724
are you?

838
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:39,258
You gonna shoot me?

839
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:50,224
Aah!

840
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:06,555
You motherfuckers don't care!

841
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:09,655
You motherfuckers don't care!

842
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:12,488
We fuckin' killed each other.

843
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:15,721
You don't give...

844
00:45:15,722 --> 00:45:18,788
Fuck!

845
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:23,720
I'm sorry!

846
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,388
Nobody fuckin' cares!

847
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:44,619
The first time I killed,

848
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,185
I was on the target

849
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:48,552
for two weeks before I engaged.

850
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,251
They tell you you're

851
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:53,618
gonna vomit or something

852
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:55,318
or have nightmares

853
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,451
or be conflicted.

854
00:45:57,452 --> 00:45:59,517
That's what they say anyway.

855
00:45:59,518 --> 00:46:00,000
They also say that the only way

856
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:02,584
they also say that the only way

857
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:03,717
to get rid of it

858
00:46:03,718 --> 00:46:05,384
is to kill again.

859
00:46:05,385 --> 00:46:07,584
But those are the cynics.

860
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:09,584
I didn't have any of that.

861
00:46:09,585 --> 00:46:12,284
That target I engaged,

862
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:13,449
that man I killed,

863
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:14,716
was a soldier.

864
00:46:14,717 --> 00:46:16,683
We were in a match.

865
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:18,583
I won.

866
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:20,584
God understands that.

867
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:29,999
Cheap shot motherfucker.

868
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,548
Cheap shot motherfucker.

869
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:32,615
Did you hear

870
00:46:32,616 --> 00:46:34,315
what I was saying?

871
00:46:34,316 --> 00:46:36,482
People get caught up

872
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:37,482
in the semantics

873
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:38,714
but don't like to see things

874
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:40,181
clearly for what they are.

875
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,414
They want to argue about

876
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:42,714
interpretations but not about

877
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:44,214
what's true.

878
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:46,180
There's no morality,

879
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:47,947
not in language.

880
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:48,680
You can justify

881
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,547
anything with words.

882
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,413
What the fuck are you

883
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,480
talking about?

884
00:46:58,481 --> 00:46:59,999
Is that all you do up here?

885
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,613
Is that all you do up here?

886
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:02,413
Talk to your damn self.

887
00:47:02,414 --> 00:47:03,679
I'm talking to you,

888
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,445
lieutenant.

889
00:47:05,446 --> 00:47:06,713
Better listen.

890
00:47:10,013 --> 00:47:11,612
Ahh.

891
00:47:11,613 --> 00:47:14,412
I'm going back to sleep.

892
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:16,611
Uh-huh.

893
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:18,545
All right.

894
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:23,678
But what do you know

895
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,578
anyway?

896
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:27,910
You're a goddamn contractor.

897
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,610
I'm a fucking marine.

898
00:47:29,611 --> 00:47:30,000
Maybe you started out

899
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,543
maybe you started out

900
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:32,944
as a marine,

901
00:47:32,945 --> 00:47:34,443
but you ended up

902
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:36,278
a fuckin' mercenary.

903
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:09,540
What if I said yes?

904
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:10,908
Yes to what?

905
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:18,307
Yes, I'll join you.

906
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:19,407
What did you tell me?

907
00:48:19,408 --> 00:48:20,906
You haven't told me yet.

908
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:22,406
Say yes first.

909
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:25,573
What if I did?

910
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:29,539
What's your plan?

911
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,000
You don't even know, do you?

912
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:31,373
You don't even know, do you?

913
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:33,039
What you're doing

914
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,538
up here,

915
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:37,472
you're killing some businessman.

916
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:38,939
It's a world of shit

917
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,038
you're in for this.

918
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:42,405
Are we gonna be like

919
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:44,538
that D.C. sniper?

920
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:45,904
Posting up in a trunk

921
00:48:45,905 --> 00:48:48,305
somewhere shooting soccer moms?

922
00:48:48,306 --> 00:48:49,404
See, that man

923
00:48:49,405 --> 00:48:51,537
had no imagination.

924
00:48:51,538 --> 00:48:53,871
All the career criminals in D.C.

925
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:55,104
And the only people he finds

926
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:56,571
to kill are innocents?

927
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:59,570
You got it worked out, right?

928
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:00,000
How we're gonna be different

929
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:01,570
how we're gonna be different

930
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,037
than him.

931
00:49:03,038 --> 00:49:06,103
See, I bet he had a plan, too.

932
00:49:06,104 --> 00:49:09,503
I bet he planned on all sorts of

933
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:10,536
things coming together, but in

934
00:49:10,537 --> 00:49:11,902
the end, he was just a crazy

935
00:49:11,903 --> 00:49:13,837
motherfucker with good aim.

936
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,802
He was a vet, too.

937
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:19,935
What other country's

938
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:21,135
gonna make a man like that?

939
00:49:21,136 --> 00:49:24,003
You're right. It made you.

940
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:27,835
All of man's problems stems

941
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:28,968
from his inability to sit by

942
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:29,999
himself alone in an empty room.

943
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,402
Himself alone in an empty room.

944
00:49:35,402 --> 00:49:36,867
Man, your shooters

945
00:49:36,868 --> 00:49:38,368
are a strange breed.

946
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:39,500
Then again, what might be

947
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:40,967
the problem is we keep building

948
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:42,368
all these empty rooms.

949
00:49:45,835 --> 00:49:49,433
Real fuckin' strange.

950
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:51,833
My buddy, binder...

951
00:49:51,834 --> 00:49:54,499
He couldn't handle what he saw

952
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,966
over there.

953
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,432
Blew his brains out

954
00:49:58,433 --> 00:49:59,499
the night he got back

955
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,000
to Georgia.

956
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:00,765
To Georgia.

957
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:03,099
But he didn't just kill himself.

958
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,865
He killed his wife,

959
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:07,898
his two kids,

960
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:10,766
then himself.

961
00:50:13,865 --> 00:50:16,266
What could make a man do that?

962
00:50:19,032 --> 00:50:20,364
You just see a bunch

963
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:21,764
of random words.

964
00:50:21,765 --> 00:50:23,731
But look closer.

965
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:24,963
There's a pattern.

966
00:50:24,964 --> 00:50:26,364
There's a pattern to everything.

967
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:27,863
I don't see it.

968
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:29,496
I don't either yet.

969
00:50:29,497 --> 00:50:29,999
But that's the work

970
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,830
but that's the work

971
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:32,364
of the whole thing, it's there.

972
00:50:46,115 --> 00:50:48,428
What's that?

973
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:49,729
That, my friend,

974
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,861
is a kill hole.

975
00:50:51,862 --> 00:50:53,694
There was a native people

976
00:50:53,695 --> 00:50:55,295
in the southwest,

977
00:50:55,296 --> 00:50:57,361
membray, tribe of Potters.

978
00:50:57,362 --> 00:50:58,894
Made the most beautiful,

979
00:50:58,895 --> 00:50:59,999
perfect pots there were.

980
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,861
Perfect pots there were.

981
00:51:00,862 --> 00:51:02,027
But before they died,

982
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:04,094
they killed their pots.

983
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:05,693
Cut a hole in the center

984
00:51:05,694 --> 00:51:06,927
of each one.

985
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:09,793
The hole released the spirit of

986
00:51:09,794 --> 00:51:11,094
the Clay so it could join them

987
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:13,059
in the next world.

988
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,793
Kill their pots?

989
00:51:15,794 --> 00:51:18,792
Looks to me like you drew a big

990
00:51:18,793 --> 00:51:20,059
fucking circle on some paper.

991
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,792
That circle,

992
00:51:21,793 --> 00:51:22,792
that space there,

993
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:24,093
that hole,

994
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:26,092
that's the mystery.

995
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:27,726
That's the place that was there

996
00:51:27,727 --> 00:51:29,125
before the words were.

997
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:29,999
That's where they come from.

998
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,758
That's where they come from.

999
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:32,691
That's where they go.

1000
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:34,891
It's where everything falls out.

1001
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:36,691
It's where you and I go

1002
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:37,892
when we're done here.

1003
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:51,909
The kill hole.

1004
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:32,189

in ya.

1053
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,809
I told you I wasn't gonna

1054
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:06,941
kill ya.

1055
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:08,175
Thought you was just

1056
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:10,041
sweet-talkin' me.

1057
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:12,474
The knife was the one,

1058
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,741
I knew it, I knew it.

1059
00:55:15,742 --> 00:55:17,774
That was the test.

1060
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:19,674
You did good.

1061
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:20,807
You did good!

1062
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:21,873
How'd I know you were

1063
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:24,140
gonna say that?

1064
00:55:24,141 --> 00:55:25,907
The truth is,

1065
00:55:25,908 --> 00:55:27,807
you don't have much

1066
00:55:27,808 --> 00:55:29,139
of a choice about killing me,

1067
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,999
you know that, right?

1068
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,673
You know that, right?

1069
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:32,640
Is it just me,

1070
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:35,006
or is that what you want?

1071
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:36,939
You go back empty-handed,

1072
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,606
they'll kill you.

1073
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:41,139
But hell,

1074
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,806
maybe they kill you

1075
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,640
one way or the other.

1076
00:55:48,772 --> 00:55:49,939
Thing is...

1077
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:54,006
I'm not going back empty-handed.

1078
00:55:57,672 --> 00:55:59,071
I'm really not gonna kill you,

1079
00:55:59,072 --> 00:55:59,999
but...

1080
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,937
But...

1081
00:56:00,938 --> 00:56:03,804
It's worse than that,

1082
00:56:03,805 --> 00:56:05,870
'cause I'm gonna need proof

1083
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:07,705
that I did.

1084
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,465
Sorry, Carter.

1085
00:57:12,466 --> 00:57:15,965
There's no other way.

1086
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,865
You already disappeared.

1087
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:23,297
Why would you leave here?

1088
00:57:23,298 --> 00:57:24,464
This is where you want to be.

1089
00:57:24,465 --> 00:57:26,731
It's not your fault,

1090
00:57:26,732 --> 00:57:29,863
Drake.

1091
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:30,000
You had to do it.

1092
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:32,031
You had to do it.

1093
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:36,430
Just tell me

1094
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:38,996
you're gonna disappear.

1095
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,363
Tell me you're not gonna

1096
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:41,664
kill anymore.

1097
00:57:45,364 --> 00:57:46,997
I forgive you.

1098
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:58,686
We were outside of Baghdad,

1099
00:59:58,687 --> 00:59:59,999
and for some reason,

1100
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,186
and for some reason,

1101
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:01,452
an old woman on the sidewalk

1102
01:00:01,453 --> 01:00:03,152
had caught my attention,

1103
01:00:03,153 --> 01:00:04,818
and I'm watching, and like

1104
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:06,285
we were saying before

1105
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:07,385
about the I.E.D.S,

1106
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:08,384
you get that tingle,

1107
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:09,518
you know something's coming,

1108
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:11,251
like, right before it happens.

1109
01:00:11,252 --> 01:00:12,685
And I'm getting that tingle,

1110
01:00:12,686 --> 01:00:15,184
and I'm watching this old woman,

1111
01:00:15,185 --> 01:00:17,384
and something is just wrong.

1112
01:00:17,385 --> 01:00:19,451
And she reaches down,

1113
01:00:19,452 --> 01:00:21,650
and she's reaching down

1114
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,117
to the ground, and it looks like

1115
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:24,116
she's grabbing the bottom

1116
01:00:24,117 --> 01:00:25,817
the bottom of her burka,

1117
01:00:25,818 --> 01:00:27,350
and she proceeds to pull it up

1118
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:28,350
and take a huge dump

1119
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:29,999
on the sidewalk, and I just,

1120
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,151
on the sidewalk, and I just,

1121
01:00:30,152 --> 01:00:31,450
I've never been the same

1122
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:32,352
ever since.

1123
01:00:33,184 --> 01:00:34,516
Every time I see an old lady,

1124
01:00:34,517 --> 01:00:36,516
I just, I pray that

1125
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:38,182
please,

1126
01:00:38,183 --> 01:00:39,282
please wait!

1127
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:40,382
We talk a lot about

1128
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:41,516
the negative stuff,

1129
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:43,115
but camaraderie,

1130
01:00:43,116 --> 01:00:44,115
you know,

1131
01:00:44,116 --> 01:00:45,548
having your friends

1132
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:46,548
and other soldiers

1133
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:48,115
be your family

1134
01:00:48,116 --> 01:00:50,181
and having these people with you

1135
01:00:50,182 --> 01:00:52,148
that have your back,

1136
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,415
like, I mean, more than

1137
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,582
you can ever imagine,

1138
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,148
that's one of the things I miss

1139
01:00:56,149 --> 01:00:57,148
about the military.

1140
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:58,181
We were always bonded

1141
01:00:58,182 --> 01:00:59,999
together because of a conflict

1142
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,182
together because of a conflict

1143
01:01:00,183 --> 01:01:01,447
that brought us together.

1144
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:02,714
I don't have the same

1145
01:01:02,715 --> 01:01:03,781
connections to them

1146
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:04,814
that I did.

1147
01:01:04,815 --> 01:01:05,814
The military

1148
01:01:05,815 --> 01:01:07,113
was that connection.

1149
01:01:07,114 --> 01:01:08,113
And so that bond that

1150
01:01:08,114 --> 01:01:09,414
we had then and that support

1151
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,247
that we felt and that gave us

1152
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:13,280
the strength is gone.

1153
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:15,379
We're standing alone now!

1154
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,580
My first time in combat,

1155
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:21,146
kandahar,

1156
01:01:21,147 --> 01:01:23,246
I shit my pants.

1157
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:27,179
Piss,

1158
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,378
shit,

1159
01:01:29,379 --> 01:01:29,999
the whole works,

1160
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,111
the whole works,

1161
01:01:31,112 --> 01:01:33,245
just shootin' at nothin',

1162
01:01:33,246 --> 01:01:36,245
scared as fuck,

1163
01:01:36,246 --> 01:01:39,112
covered in shit.

1164
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:45,611
You know, what the recruiter

1165
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:47,077
won't tell you,

1166
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,411
what they don't want you

1167
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:49,444
to know,

1168
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:50,677
you have to shed a lot of pride

1169
01:01:50,678 --> 01:01:52,577
to do what we do.

1170
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:54,276
You can think you're all type

1171
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,243
of man, but until you're in

1172
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:57,510
a firefight, until you've

1173
01:01:57,511 --> 01:01:58,976
been there, you don't know what

1174
01:01:58,977 --> 01:01:59,999
you're made of, you don't know

1175
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,177
you're made of, you don't know

1176
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:01,510
shit about yourself,

1177
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,243
but it's the funnest

1178
01:02:03,244 --> 01:02:06,276
damn thing you ever experience.

1179
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:10,677
I wouldn't trade it for nothing.

1180
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:23,341
Do you ever leave this thing?

1181
01:02:23,342 --> 01:02:25,975
Just to come in here.

1182
01:02:28,942 --> 01:02:29,999
Got any ladies in your life?

1183
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,674
Got any ladies in your life?

1184
01:02:30,675 --> 01:02:33,974
That's a negative also, sir.

1185
01:02:33,975 --> 01:02:35,440
Do you think, by chance,

1186
01:02:35,441 --> 01:02:38,507
these two things are connected?

1187
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:40,374
Probably, sir.

1188
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,506
You know, that was a good talk

1189
01:02:46,507 --> 01:02:48,105
in there tonight.

1190
01:02:48,106 --> 01:02:49,272
Thanks.

1191
01:02:49,273 --> 01:02:51,072
No, I mean that.

1192
01:02:51,073 --> 01:02:53,073
I know, I know.

1193
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:59,999
Feels good, doesn't it?

1194
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,072
Feels good, doesn't it?

1195
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:02,138
Maybe.

1196
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:05,371
Yeah, it does.

1197
01:03:05,372 --> 01:03:06,637
All right.

1198
01:03:06,638 --> 01:03:07,637
You know, the thing

1199
01:03:07,638 --> 01:03:09,337
about opening up,

1200
01:03:09,338 --> 01:03:10,337
you finally spill...

1201
01:03:10,338 --> 01:03:11,337
Hey, hey, hey,

1202
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:12,370
enough of that man.

1203
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,370
You keep me talkin',

1204
01:03:13,371 --> 01:03:14,504
I'm gonna cut on the meter.

1205
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:15,571
What do you want, taxi cab

1206
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:17,003
confessions up in here?

1207
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:18,037
What are you

1208
01:03:18,038 --> 01:03:19,103
bending my ear for anyway?

1209
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:20,070
Don't you think I got

1210
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:21,404
things to do? Get outta here.

1211
01:03:54,978 --> 01:03:56,134
How you doin', 902?

1212
01:03:56,135 --> 01:03:57,934
This thing still runnin'?

1213
01:03:57,935 --> 01:03:58,934
Yeah.

1214
01:03:58,935 --> 01:03:59,999
Stuck me with this piece of shit

1215
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,334
stuck me with this piece of shit

1216
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:01,234
again.

1217
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:03,428
<i>What could I tell you,</i>

1218
01:05:03,429 --> 01:05:04,762
<i>my friend, that you don't</i>

1219
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:06,329
<i>already know?</i>

1220
01:05:09,763 --> 01:05:11,361
<i>Is there any combination</i>

1221
01:05:11,362 --> 01:05:13,028
<i>of words</i>

1222
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:14,761
<i>that I could surprise you</i>

1223
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:16,061
<i>with?</i>

1224
01:05:16,062 --> 01:05:18,327
<i>Would you believe me anyway</i>

1225
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:19,461
<i>if I did?</i>

1226
01:05:25,794 --> 01:05:27,127
Guy came by the other day

1227
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:29,999
looking for ya, left you this.

1228
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,060
Looking for ya, left you this.

1229
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:32,526
Said he was a friend of yours.

1230
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:33,826
Friend of mine?

1231
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:34,827
Yeah.

1232
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,458
<i>I was inspired by all</i>

1233
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:43,358
<i>your tales of loneliness</i>

1234
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,458
<i>out here on the streets,</i>

1235
01:05:45,459 --> 01:05:47,891
<i>inspired enough to find out</i>

1236
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:49,159
<i>for myself.</i>

1237
01:05:52,926 --> 01:05:54,891
<i>So it's no surprise to tell you</i>

1238
01:05:54,892 --> 01:05:57,224
<i>how lonely I am.</i>

1239
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:59,991
<i>I don't mind telling you that.</i>

1240
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:04,990
<i>I'll tell you, too,</i>

1241
01:06:04,991 --> 01:06:07,157
<i>how scared I was my first night</i>

1242
01:06:07,158 --> 01:06:11,024
<i>out here,</i>

1243
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:12,956
<i>how fear is the only thing you</i>

1244
01:06:12,957 --> 01:06:15,191
<i>can see in the city at night.</i>

1245
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,756
<i>The screaming,</i>

1246
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:23,189
<i>the dirt,</i>

1247
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:27,155
<i>the hunger,</i>

1248
01:06:27,156 --> 01:06:29,999
<i>the jackals,</i>

1249
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,023
<i>the jackals,</i>

1250
01:06:30,024 --> 01:06:33,022
<i>sick with blood,</i>

1251
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:35,221
<i>a sickness</i>

1252
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:37,422
<i>no army could destroy.</i>

1253
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:43,654
<i>The shadows,</i>

1254
01:06:43,655 --> 01:06:46,288
<i>but you know about them, right?</i>

1255
01:06:46,289 --> 01:06:49,754
<i>How they covered your light?</i>

1256
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,920
<i>How they eat up</i>

1257
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:56,786
<i>what's good in the world.</i>

1258
01:06:56,787 --> 01:06:58,819
<i>Then when they're done,</i>

1259
01:06:58,820 --> 01:06:59,999
<i>there's nothing to show for it</i>

1260
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,420
<i>there's nothing to show for it</i>

1261
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:03,352
<i>but their darkness,</i>

1262
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,654
<i>taking all the light...</i>

1263
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:12,686
<i>Putting out the flame...</i>

1264
01:07:16,152 --> 01:07:17,652
<i>Drawing attention</i>

1265
01:07:17,653 --> 01:07:19,019
<i>to themselves.</i>

1266
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:24,285
<i>You didn't want these kind</i>

1267
01:07:24,286 --> 01:07:26,651
<i>of decisions to make.</i>

1268
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:28,651
<i>But here I am</i>

1269
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:29,999
<i>fucking that all up.</i>

1270
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,185
<i>Fucking that all up.</i>

1271
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:35,750
<i>You understand that this</i>

1272
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,050
<i>is the only move I have.</i>

1273
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:41,017
<i>This is my burden.</i>

1274
01:07:41,018 --> 01:07:45,284
<i>This is my god I'm mad at.</i>

1275
01:07:48,317 --> 01:07:50,116
<i>And you,</i>

1276
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:52,649
<i>what's that you said once?</i>

1277
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:56,582
<i>We're all just pawns?</i>

1278
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:59,148
<i>You're right.</i>

1279
01:07:59,149 --> 01:07:59,999
<i>But pawns</i>

1280
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,648
<i>but pawns</i>

1281
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:02,615
<i>win the wars.</i>

1282
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:08,080
<i>Carry this burden, lieutenant.</i>

1283
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:11,614
<i>Finish this war.</i>

1284
01:08:11,615 --> 01:08:14,614
<i>Open your heart.</i>

1285
01:08:20,714 --> 01:08:23,648
<i>Come back home, and find me.</i>

1286
01:08:51,745 --> 01:08:57,644
Come on, marsh.

1287
01:08:57,645 --> 01:08:59,999
Pick up, pick up, pick up,

1288
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,244
pick up, pick up, pick up,

1289
01:09:00,245 --> 01:09:03,709
pick up.

1290
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,177
Ugh!

1291
01:09:07,178 --> 01:09:09,610
Shit!

1292
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,999
Why do you have a gun, Sam?

1293
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,874
Why do you have a gun, Sam?

1294
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,108
It's nothing.

1295
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:36,707
Are you in trouble again?

1296
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:38,140
I don't got time to clean up,

1297
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:39,140
so if you could just

1298
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,707
throw any of this stuff away,

1299
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:41,706
give it away.

1300
01:09:41,707 --> 01:09:42,606
Sam,

1301
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:44,473
what are you talking about?

1302
01:09:44,474 --> 01:09:45,506
What are you doing?

1303
01:09:45,507 --> 01:09:46,573
If anyone comes,

1304
01:09:46,574 --> 01:09:47,573
just tell them I left.

1305
01:09:47,574 --> 01:09:48,573
You don't know where,

1306
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:49,573
I just left.

1307
01:09:49,574 --> 01:09:50,573
I'm not telling anyone

1308
01:09:50,574 --> 01:09:51,706
anything, it's okay.

1309
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:54,039
You can stay with me.

1310
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,640
It's okay.

1311
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:03,673
I need to go.

1312
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,704
Thanks.

1313
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,705
Ugh!

1314
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:28,436
Into the bathroom. Be quiet.

1315
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:29,837
Now.

1316
01:10:29,838 --> 01:10:30,000
Go, girl.

1317
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:31,570
Go, girl.

1318
01:10:31,571 --> 01:10:33,137
I'm all right.

1319
01:10:34,737 --> 01:10:37,069
Lieutenant Drake,

1320
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,569
we need to have

1321
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:43,003
a very long conversation.

1322
01:11:12,443 --> 01:11:14,599
I'm disappointed.

1323
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,101
Aren't we all?

1324
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,666
The Drake of myth and lore

1325
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,566
in our company

1326
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,599
is a cold, calculating,

1327
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,532
finely tuned killing machine.

1328
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,732
But now, Drake,

1329
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:30,000
by all appearances,

1330
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:31,765
by all appearances,

1331
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:33,732
you're just a man,

1332
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:36,465
a coward at that.

1333
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:37,764
Here's a man that's apt to be

1334
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:40,398
without the proper guidance.

1335
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,564
We did give you the guidance.

1336
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:45,430
I don't even know

1337
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:46,797
who you are.

1338
01:11:46,798 --> 01:11:49,331
Ughhh!

1339
01:11:52,664 --> 01:11:54,530
I'd find that surprising

1340
01:11:54,531 --> 01:11:55,663
if I didn't know you went

1341
01:11:55,664 --> 01:11:56,796
from our company

1342
01:11:56,797 --> 01:11:58,796
to living under a bridge,

1343
01:11:58,797 --> 01:11:59,999
then to driving frat boys

1344
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,563
then to driving frat boys

1345
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:03,396
and hookers around for pennies.

1346
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:04,429
I'm sure there's plenty

1347
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,662
that passed you by.

1348
01:12:06,663 --> 01:12:08,662
That was the idea.

1349
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:09,662
Ugh!

1350
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:10,662
Aah!

1351
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:14,395
Aah.

1352
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,529
This is Mr. Stanford hull.

1353
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,794
He's our company's founder.

1354
01:12:19,795 --> 01:12:21,528
And I'm here,

1355
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:23,528
because my chief executive,

1356
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:24,794
Peter krebbs,

1357
01:12:24,795 --> 01:12:26,561
was just murdered,

1358
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:28,594
and I hold you

1359
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:29,999
personally responsible for that.

1360
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,280
Personally responsible for that.

1361
01:12:33,661 --> 01:12:36,660
Krebbs was the other one.

1362
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:39,460
Yes, the other one.

1363
01:12:39,461 --> 01:12:41,792
You were a bum

1364
01:12:41,793 --> 01:12:43,959
on the street, is that right?

1365
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,726
We did give you a second chance

1366
01:12:46,727 --> 01:12:48,826
in life, correct?

1367
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:50,359
You did provide an ear,

1368
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,759
Mr. Drake,

1369
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,758
as evidence of your services.

1370
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:57,992
Now what happened?

1371
01:12:57,993 --> 01:12:59,999
I can't tell you that.

1372
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,858
I can't tell you that.

1373
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:02,558
Oh!

1374
01:13:02,559 --> 01:13:03,858
Lie to me, Mr. Drake,

1375
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:06,324
tell me this whole thing

1376
01:13:06,325 --> 01:13:07,558
is a figment

1377
01:13:07,559 --> 01:13:09,258
of my imagination,

1378
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:10,857
that when I call my number one

1379
01:13:10,858 --> 01:13:12,557
krebbs on his cell phone,

1380
01:13:12,558 --> 01:13:14,724
he's gonna answer as always,

1381
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:17,390
because he's alive and well.

1382
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:19,590
Can you tell me that?

1383
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:21,689
No you can't, can you?

1384
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,890
What do you want?

1385
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:23,890
You're gonna tell me

1386
01:13:23,891 --> 01:13:25,223
where Carter is.

1387
01:13:25,224 --> 01:13:26,289
Can't do that.

1388
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:28,623
Krebbs gave you money which

1389
01:13:28,624 --> 01:13:29,999
is my money and I'd like to see

1390
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,656
is my money and I'd like to see

1391
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,688
a return on it.

1392
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:35,555
Did you even find Carter?

1393
01:13:35,556 --> 01:13:39,421
Did you look?

1394
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:40,955
Or did the two of you

1395
01:13:40,956 --> 01:13:43,655
go brokeback out there?

1396
01:13:43,656 --> 01:13:44,988
Is that what this is about?

1397
01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:46,388
If I knew where he was,

1398
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:47,954
I'd kill him myself.

1399
01:13:47,955 --> 01:13:50,655
That's doubtful.

1400
01:13:53,822 --> 01:13:55,488
Get the spare.

1401
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:15,352
Why don't you tell me

1402
01:14:15,353 --> 01:14:16,418
what happened out there?

1403
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:17,485
I don't want anything

1404
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,585
to do with you.

1405
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:19,685
Where is he?

1406
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:20,685
I'm not killing anyone

1407
01:14:20,686 --> 01:14:21,819
for you.

1408
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,285
That is the problem here.

1409
01:14:24,286 --> 01:14:26,584
Too late, Drake.

1410
01:14:26,585 --> 01:14:28,218
That's right.

1411
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:29,999
Too fucking late.

1412
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,680
Too fucking late.

1413
01:14:32,619 --> 01:14:33,886
Get the can.

1414
01:14:40,152 --> 01:14:41,350
Crazy sons of bitches.

1415
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:42,750
Gaaaahhhhhhh!

1416
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:44,617
You outta your fuckin' mind!

1417
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:45,817
Aahhhhhh!

1418
01:14:45,818 --> 01:14:47,350
Aahhhhhh!

1419
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:48,617
Beautiful method here

1420
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:50,616
you developed, Drake.

1421
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:52,749
You remember this, don't you?

1422
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,216
Karma does travel

1423
01:14:55,217 --> 01:14:56,215
internationally.

1424
01:14:56,216 --> 01:14:58,349
I thought everyone knew that.

1425
01:14:58,350 --> 01:14:59,999
You can't run from it.

1426
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,549
You can't run from it.

1427
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:03,616
It meets you wherever you go.

1428
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,214
Looks like I forgot

1429
01:15:12,215 --> 01:15:14,249
my most important tool.

1430
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:34,312
Now, Mr. Drake,

1431
01:15:34,313 --> 01:15:37,779
this is the last time.

1432
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,179
We need to know where Carter is,

1433
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,746
and you need to tell us.

1434
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:48,212
I'm not telling you shit.

1435
01:15:56,246 --> 01:15:59,999
It's a shame we couldn't

1436
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,210
it's a shame we couldn't

1437
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:03,411
have come to some understanding.

1438
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:10,311
Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

1439
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:15,511
I'm no animal, lieutenant.

1440
01:16:23,643 --> 01:16:28,743
You were next.

1441
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:38,474
It's true.

1442
01:16:38,475 --> 01:16:40,074
Look in my jacket pocket.

1443
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:41,108
It's all there.

1444
01:16:57,207 --> 01:16:59,039
I didn't realize

1445
01:16:59,040 --> 01:16:59,999
our shooter was so eloquent.

1446
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,472
Our shooter was so eloquent.

1447
01:17:01,473 --> 01:17:04,305
He's at the fire tower.

1448
01:17:04,306 --> 01:17:07,339
Same place.

1449
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,740
He wants me to kill him.

1450
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:15,438
I know what I've gotta do,

1451
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:17,972
so let me do it.

1452
01:17:17,973 --> 01:17:20,372
Not for you.

1453
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:26,438
I just need to make a stop

1454
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:27,505
first.

1455
01:17:43,312 --> 01:17:45,333
Five minutes, Drake.

1456
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:49,035
All I'm sayin' is that you

1457
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:51,169
got some shit to deal with,

1458
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,635
because you're hiding out

1459
01:17:52,636 --> 01:17:54,202
at home,

1460
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,568
and you come down here

1461
01:17:55,569 --> 01:17:56,602
to hide out

1462
01:17:56,603 --> 01:17:57,635
so no one sees you,

1463
01:17:57,636 --> 01:17:59,034
and then you come in here

1464
01:17:59,035 --> 01:17:59,999
and you say you feel invisible.

1465
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,302
And you say you feel invisible.

1466
01:18:00,303 --> 01:18:02,034
Well, yeah, of course you do.

1467
01:18:02,035 --> 01:18:03,168
I mean, that's just something

1468
01:18:03,169 --> 01:18:05,335
I think we gotta look at.

1469
01:18:05,336 --> 01:18:07,035
Hey.

1470
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:13,033
What the hell happened to you?

1471
01:18:13,034 --> 01:18:15,167
What happened to you?

1472
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:17,168
Come here, sit down.

1473
01:18:18,168 --> 01:18:19,600
Hey, whoa.

1474
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:21,067
Shh, it's all right.

1475
01:18:21,068 --> 01:18:23,533
Sit down.

1476
01:18:23,534 --> 01:18:26,266
What happened?

1477
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:28,333
Who did this to you?

1478
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:29,433
Who did this to you?

1479
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:29,999
I did this. I did it.

1480
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,199
I did this. I did it.

1481
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,199
All right.

1482
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,365
Why don't you just sit down?

1483
01:18:33,366 --> 01:18:36,065
I can't--I can't stay.

1484
01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:38,065
What's this?

1485
01:18:38,066 --> 01:18:40,198
My brother.

1486
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:42,298
You remember?

1487
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:45,098
Can you give this to him?

1488
01:18:45,099 --> 01:18:47,098
Yeah.

1489
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:49,564
Yeah.

1490
01:18:49,565 --> 01:18:51,631
All right. I will.

1491
01:18:51,632 --> 01:18:53,231
Can you sit down for me?

1492
01:18:53,232 --> 01:18:54,264
I can't sit down now.

1493
01:18:54,265 --> 01:18:55,264
There are people outside

1494
01:18:55,265 --> 01:18:56,297
waiting for me.

1495
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:57,297
Wait, you mean

1496
01:18:57,298 --> 01:18:59,263
the people who did this to you,

1497
01:18:59,264 --> 01:18:59,999
they're outside?

1498
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,297
They're outside?

1499
01:19:00,298 --> 01:19:01,430
They're outside right now?

1500
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:02,430
It's all right.

1501
01:19:02,431 --> 01:19:03,430
They're gonna

1502
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:04,430
help make it right.

1503
01:19:04,431 --> 01:19:05,430
Don't fuck with me, Drake.

1504
01:19:05,431 --> 01:19:07,163
It's okay.

1505
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:10,429
I just wanted to say thank you.

1506
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:13,030
Thank you for just being there.

1507
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:17,496
Can you please just get this

1508
01:19:17,497 --> 01:19:18,496
to my brother?

1509
01:19:18,497 --> 01:19:19,496
Yeah.

1510
01:19:19,497 --> 01:19:21,561
I'm gonna do that.

1511
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:22,561
All right?

1512
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:23,595
I'm gonna do that

1513
01:19:23,596 --> 01:19:25,461
in about five minutes.

1514
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:27,429
Marsh!

1515
01:19:29,562 --> 01:19:30,000
Marsh.

1516
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:31,394
Marsh.

1517
01:19:31,395 --> 01:19:32,595
What is this?

1518
01:19:32,596 --> 01:19:34,394
What, what do you want?

1519
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,460
The private sec--

1520
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:37,560
The private sector.

1521
01:19:37,561 --> 01:19:39,527
You're private sector.

1522
01:19:39,528 --> 01:19:40,560
You didn't tell me

1523
01:19:40,561 --> 01:19:41,527
you were a fucking mercenary.

1524
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:42,560
That's what this is about?

1525
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:43,560
Marsh.

1526
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:45,260
You forgot to mention that one,

1527
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:46,393
you fucking animals!

1528
01:19:46,394 --> 01:19:47,526
You wanna fight

1529
01:19:47,527 --> 01:19:48,526
for the corporations?

1530
01:19:48,527 --> 01:19:49,993
Go be a goddamn security guard!

1531
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,292
You leave this boy alone!

1532
01:19:51,293 --> 01:19:52,459
I've been trying to leave

1533
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:53,559
'em, I got shit to clean up!

1534
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,059
That's why they're here!

1535
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,060
All right.

1536
01:20:03,392 --> 01:20:04,792
I ain't got shit to do

1537
01:20:04,793 --> 01:20:06,125
with them after this.

1538
01:20:06,126 --> 01:20:07,793
Mm-hmm.

1539
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:21,057
The war's over.

1540
01:20:21,058 --> 01:20:24,457
Ain't that right, marsh?

1541
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:27,325
The war's over.

1542
01:20:49,165 --> 01:20:52,521
No!

1543
01:20:52,522 --> 01:20:54,989
Okay, okay.

1544
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:23,143
Drake?

1545
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:25,343
What is it?

1546
01:23:25,344 --> 01:23:28,709
I knew you'd come.

1547
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:29,999
You're my friend.

1548
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,680
You're my friend.

1549
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:35,342
Fuck you, Carter.

1550
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:38,242
You almost got me killed.

1551
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:40,609
I knew I'd see you again.

1552
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,675
Turn around.

1553
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:58,040
Turn around, goddamn it.

1554
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:59,040
I'm not shootin' you

1555
01:23:59,041 --> 01:23:59,999
in the back.

1556
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,500
In the back.

1557
01:24:17,475 --> 01:24:21,205
It'll be better.

1558
01:24:21,206 --> 01:24:25,138
It'll be better next time.

1559
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:28,704
All of this'll be gone.

1560
01:24:28,705 --> 01:24:29,999
Leave this shit behind.

1561
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,920
Leave this shit behind.

1562
01:24:34,638 --> 01:24:36,505
It's better that way.

1563
01:24:40,637 --> 01:24:42,636
You know that feeling,

1564
01:24:42,637 --> 01:24:45,670
that feeling

1565
01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:49,736
when it's all clear?

1566
01:24:49,737 --> 01:24:51,736
I can see it.

1567
01:24:51,737 --> 01:24:53,669
I can see it all now.

1568
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:54,702
No more words, Carter.

1569
01:24:54,703 --> 01:24:56,602
No praise. No blame.

1570
01:24:56,603 --> 01:24:59,235
No blame, lieutenant!

1571
01:24:59,236 --> 01:24:59,999
This is it.

1572
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,902
This is it.

1573
01:25:00,903 --> 01:25:03,569
This is all there is,

1574
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:05,801
and that's okay.

1575
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:09,168
That's okay.

1576
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:11,235
This...

1577
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:12,802
