00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,823
Clifton Hangar,
"Revolver Magazine."

1
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,457
I know who you are.

2
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,841
I'm glad you finally...

3
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,042
granted this interview.

4
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,314
I... appreciate you
trusting me with this.

5
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,480
Mind if I record this?

6
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,048
Knock yourself out.

7
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,286
Thanks, Spyder.

8
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,802
Thanks.

9
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,720
So what have you been
doing with yourself

10
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,189
for the past 20 years?

11
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,283
If you're gonna ask stupid
fucking questions, kid,

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,726
this will be the shortest
interview of your career.

13
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,434
We both know
why you're here.

14
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,938
You're on the inside.

15
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,643
So why don't we just get on
with it, huh?

16
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,948
Eric Genson.

17
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,682
This...

18
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,190
bullshit about
a third record.

19
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,286
So there really is
no third Soulz record?

20
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,059
Who was Eric Genson?

21
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,759
Where do you
want me to start?

22
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,967
Maybe the beginning
of the end, huh?

23
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,354
Okay.

24
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,718
Let's try it
one more time.

25
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,023
Except let's try it
a bit...

26
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,825
sotto voce.

27
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,797
Three and four and...

28
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,939
Have a nice day,
Mr. Genson.

29
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,496
They sound great.

30
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,090
I remember playing
that same shit song

31
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:06,468
in this classroom about
15 years ago.

32
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,734
Best part about
playing those plastic dildos

33
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,368
was lining them up on the curb
at the end of the year

34
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,344
and... smashing them.

35
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,074
Do you remember that?

36
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,173
Why are you here?

37
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,014
What kind of a welcome home
is that, huh?

38
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,917
Huh?

39
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,615
You mind?

40
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,521
Go for it.

41
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,559
See...

42
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,561
I travel 3,000 miles,

43
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,290
this is the kind of
welcome I get.

44
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,199
Eric?

45
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,572
Eric?

46
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,937
Hey!

47
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,270
Girl: Thanks, Mr. Rivers.

48
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,503
Eric!

49
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,942
Hold up for a second.

50
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,343
Why don't we...

51
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,675
We'll go out and we'll get
hammered like old times, huh?

52
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,045
I can't, I'm working.

53
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,276
- What are you doing here?
- Come on, get out of here.

54
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,511
What's going on here,
Mr. Genson?

55
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,950
- Spyder...
- Nothing, he was just leaving.

56
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,214
Can I have an
autograph, please?

57
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,380
Excuse me, can I help
you with something?

58
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,252
Yeah, I do believe you can.

59
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,290
What'd you
have in mind?

60
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,825
Herman...
oh, my God.

61
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,655
I'll see you at
the staff meeting.

62
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,717
Yes, you will.

63
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,353
Don't you want to
keep me after school?

64
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,727
I always liked detention.

65
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,992
- Hey, where...
- Oh, God.

66
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,795
Eric!

67
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,728
Good to see you,
too, bro.

68
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,567
So this used to be
considered punk?

69
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,975
Yeah, I guess.

70
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,808
I don't know.

71
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,475
I was wandering if you'd
sign my Soulz poster for me?

72
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,018
Absolutely.

73
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,849
By the way, you've, uh,

74
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,379
blossomed into
a... fucking hot chick.

75
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,686
Yeah, thanks.

76
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,693
I mean,
it's been what, like...

77
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,955
Seven years.

78
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,758
- Hey!
- Hey!

79
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,696
Big-time rock star doesn't
have a fancier place

80
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,256
to dine this evening?

81
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,427
Hey, Stove Top Stuffing.

82
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,232
Eric, of course
I'm staying.

83
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,397
Great.

84
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,306
So... what
brings you back?

85
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,209
I missed this guy.

86
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,045
And, of course,
your amazing cooking.

87
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,017
Liza.

88
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,985
Well, we all missed
you around here.

89
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,755
Oh, shit.

90
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,122
Hello.

91
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,958
Hey.

92
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,259
No, uh...

93
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,597
Why are you in
a tow truck?

94
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,830
Yeah.

95
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,841
Because it's the suburbs...
I don't know.

96
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,968
No, no, no,
the Vette's parked out front.

97
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,070
Just keep going.

98
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,012
Keep going.

99
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,310
Perfect.

100
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,374
This is the last time
you do this to me.

101
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,714
I've had it already,
Spyder.

102
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,051
I want to
get back to LA.

103
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,023
Next time, I take the car

104
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,822
and you can hitch a ride with
the village idiot, okay?

105
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,261
Rose Atropos.

106
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,266
Manager of The Lost Soulz.

107
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,858
Come sit.

108
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,165
Well.

109
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,468
- I'm Liza.
- Nice to meet you.

110
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,507
Oh, come on.

111
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,836
Welcome!

112
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,002
Can I get you
something to eat?

113
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:32,942
Just coffee.

114
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,446
Black,
would be awesome.

115
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,017
I was gonna take Rose here
to the old chill spot.

116
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,613
Remember the pier?

117
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,818
I thought we could,
uh, catch up, yeah?

118
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,453
DJ: Hey, this is Roger Luce
hanging out with you.

119
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,089
WBAB Babylon.

120
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,531
We thank everyone in Syosset
for showing the world

121
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,228
they love rock and roll.

122
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,411
- Hey, Eric!
- Spyder?

123
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,041
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

124
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,712
Hey!

125
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,719
Wow!

126
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,903
Asshole.

127
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,546
Pretty hot piece
of ass, huh?

128
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,981
Hey.

129
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,320
Yeah, we're here.

130
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,790
So your dad's car still
fucking moves, huh?

131
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,161
God.

132
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,036
How many beers do you think
we drank out here, huh?

133
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,477
Figure 24 times...

134
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,538
Remember that pizza kid
we used to pay 20 bucks

135
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,449
to deliver a
$10-case to your house?

136
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,078
Fucking thief.

137
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,850
Always had money though from
playing shows, right?

138
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,154
Yeah, we did.

139
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,251
Yeah, you remember that?

140
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,852
We were gonna
buy a VW bus

141
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,491
and drive to
LA with our demo.

142
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,797
Support ourselves playing
shows along the way.

143
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,032
You wanted to do that
bullshit Route 66 trip

144
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,971
all the way to
California.

145
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,810
Rock and roll's the bastard
son of the blues, man.

146
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,877
Yeah.

147
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,550
So you been playing?

148
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,023
Sometimes.

149
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,026
With who?

150
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,120
A few guys here and there...
you don't know 'em.

151
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,289
"A few guys
here and there."

152
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,196
Bullshit!

153
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,030
You haven't been playing
with anybody but yourself

154
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,662
in that piss-ass little
basement of yours.

155
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,706
Here we go.

156
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,298
- What?
- What is this?

157
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,569
What's going on?

158
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,508
We're hanging out now?

159
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,913
What do you want?

160
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,788
We are... making
a third Soulz record.

161
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,994
We need a guitarist.

162
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,200
The plane leaves
for LA tomorrow.

163
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,034
We start recording
in two weeks.

164
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,736
I knew it.

165
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,471
You knew it?
Knew what?

166
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,739
So what happened?

167
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,178
You milked and twisted our
demo for all it was worth

168
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,874
and now you need me to write
some more songs for you?

169
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,075
- God!
- Huh?

170
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,242
You're still on that fucking

171
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,309
musical high horse
of yours, huh?

172
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,014
I'm giving you
a fucking chance, Eric.

173
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,023
- I'm throwing you a bone.
- Oh.

174
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,422
Well, I just said no.

175
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,894
By the way,
is "Hot Cross Buns"

176
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,993
considered a blues classic?

177
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,968
Yeah.

178
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,536
You have until
tomorrow to decide.

179
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,353
"Snake Oil" was
the biggest-selling debut

180
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,949
rock album of all time.

181
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,994
Did you steal
those songs?

182
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,826
Good artists... copy.

183
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,193
The great artists
steal.

184
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,998
Some of the greatest
rock songs of all time,

185
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,472
they were stolen.

186
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,339
Plucked from obscurity.

187
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,844
Made immortal, even.

188
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,107
Your point?

189
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,672
Without me, none of those
songs would have...

190
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,951
They would have stayed
locked in that basement.

191
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,590
Chip was dead 20 years
when I got back.

192
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,896
He needed to
get the fuck over it.

193
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,763
It sounds like you spent
a lot of time in that house.

194
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,202
What about you?

195
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,263
Did you know Chip,
were you a fan?

196
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,503
I knew him.

197
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,408
We were seven
when he died.

198
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,276
Of course, I'm a fan.

199
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,577
Who hasn't been
influenced by the Hawks?

200
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,210
I mean, I suppose it's
different, though,

201
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,255
when the guitar hero banging
dope is your old man.

202
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,574
# Ain't no finer
boy in town #

203
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,479
# You're my guy just
what the doctor ordered #

204
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,791
# Taste so sweet you make
my mouth water #

205
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,223
# I want candy #

206
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,890
Goddamn it, Chip.

207
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,400
Young man...

208
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,493
Come on, come on.

209
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,697
Oh, fuck, wait,
hold on.

210
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,602
Eric?

211
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,935
Oh, shit.

212
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,236
Hey, Eric, what's up?

213
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,040
Eric?

214
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,748
Can you help me out,
please?

215
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,318
Come on, man, please.

216
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,117
Everybody out!

217
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,183
Every fucking time.

218
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,786
Clear out of here!

219
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,269
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Hawks!

220
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,901
Hello, New York!

221
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,751
He's come for you,
hasn't he?

222
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,123
When are you leaving?

223
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,899
Look at that face,
huh?

224
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,895
Will you be
all right?

225
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,931
She'll be fine, Eric.

226
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,637
All right.

227
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,182
Well... see you, kid.

228
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,979
Look who's here.

229
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,545
Let's go, Teach.

230
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,181
Let's get out of here.

231
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,227
Oh, and I'm not wearing any
of that fucking makeup.

232
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,356
Why are you here?

233
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,059
You didn't tell him.

234
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,398
Tell him what?

235
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,206
Uh, Spyder,
you remember Augie, right?

236
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,245
Yeah, yeah, so what?

237
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,803
He's driving.

238
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,508
I'm sorry... Driving?

239
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,847
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yeah.

240
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,479
You want your record,
we take that trip.

241
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,614
What?

242
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,783
You need my songs.

243
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,089
We do it my way
or we don't do it at all.

244
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,899
Route 66.

245
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,457
Fuck, this is
ridiculous.

246
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,965
Back up, back up.

247
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,736
What do you mean by
"a change of plans"?

248
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,867
I'm coming out,
I'm coming out.

249
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,013
What?

250
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,782
Surprise.

251
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,321
What the fuck
is this?

252
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,414
- Get in.
- Get in?

253
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,254
I thought you said
you could get this guy.

254
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,759
We do get this guy,
all right?

255
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,624
Come here, come here,
come here,

256
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,684
come here, come here...

257
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,991
Have you fucking
lost your mind?

258
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,057
We have to be at the airport,
Spyder, in one hour.

259
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,066
One hour!

260
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,124
And the limo's
on it's way.

261
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,295
No airports,
no nothing, okay?

262
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,169
This is our fucking limo.

263
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,705
That's funny.

264
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,870
What is that
piece of shit?

265
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,437
I'm not getting in that
piece of shit.

266
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,039
What the fuck do you
want me to do, Rose?

267
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,209
You're fucking crazy!

268
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,752
What the fuck do you want me
to do, okay?

269
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,788
We have two weeks,
we have no songs.

270
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,220
What do you
want me to do?

271
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,321
All right, ladies.

272
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,795
In three notes, can you
name this tune?

273
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,593
Spyder, who is this guy?

274
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,657
Don't ask.

275
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,225
We were traveling west
in a covered wagon

276
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,965
across the country.

277
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,998
I played
Madison Square Garden,

278
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,737
for fuck's sake, you know.

279
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,405
And Rose...

280
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,470
was pissed.

281
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,516
I mean, you got
August West at the wheel

282
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,519
and the prospect of this great
adventure before you.

283
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,214
Fuck adventure.

284
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,657
I needed a record's worth
of songs...

285
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,091
in two weeks,

286
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:53,222
or the record label
was gonna... drop me.

287
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,165
And where does this
clown take us?

288
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,940
Hey, Eric, wait a second.

289
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,522
Oh, my God.

290
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,524
I've, uh...

291
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,864
Wow.

292
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,598
Waited, uh...

293
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,606
waited a long time
for this.

294
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,767
A long time.

295
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,970
- Holy shit, Augie.
- Really.

296
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,348
It's in tune.

297
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,718
Yeah.

298
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,358
Oh, man.

299
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,890
- What's this?
- What?

300
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,901
It's Vicodin.

301
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,197
Don't go through
my shit, man.

302
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,760
Are you fucking
kidding me?

303
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,102
- Are you kidding me?!
- What's the big deal, man?

304
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,368
Careful!

305
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,171
You're not my
fucking dad, okay?

306
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,370
No, I'm not your
fucking father.

307
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,640
I...

308
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,079
I just can't
do this again.

309
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,810
It's not that
big of a deal.

310
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,010
It's under control, man.

311
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:20,949
Fuck!

312
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,112
- Jesus Christ!
- God, man.

313
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,655
How about another beer, guys?

314
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,382
It's on me.

315
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,515
Come on,
you want a shot?

316
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,220
- Have a shot.
- Thanks, darling.

317
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,194
What'll it be, honey?

318
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,696
Have a shot of whiskey.

319
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,130
Coming right up.

320
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,565
What are you
guys doing here?

321
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,069
I don't know,
ask him.

322
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,636
Yo, where the fuck
are we anyway?

323
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,303
Scranton.

324
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,537
Look at this fucking place.

325
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,878
Yo, man, can this guy
even fucking play?

326
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,714
One time me and my three
friends stole my mom's car

327
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,850
to go see these guys at
The Spectrum in Philly.

328
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,019
We had to drive
the whole way

329
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,926
in January
with the windows open

330
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,659
because the damn car had
a leaky gas line.

331
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,564
We nearly
froze our asses off.

332
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:10,499
Cool.

333
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,661
Can I get another?

334
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,533
Who's the new guy?

335
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,037
He's hot.

336
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,700
- Can I meet him?
- Sure.

337
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,709
Fuck!

338
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,142
Been one of those days?

339
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,475
It's been
one of those years.

340
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,386
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

341
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,479
- Like that.
- Cool.

342
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,818
Just follow me.

343
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,336
# It's goin' down #

344
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,972
# In Tinseltown #

345
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,346
# Circus is here #

346
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,681
# Children gather around #

347
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,219
# We were lost #

348
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,017
# But everybody's found
tonight #

349
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,417
# Go get the girls #

350
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,086
# In black and pearls #

351
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,724
# Drivin' daddy's Jag
to the top of the world #

352
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,233
# Down in the valley #

353
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,134
# The stars will never shine
so bright #

354
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:26,704
# Every neon night
burns away #

355
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,778
# Everything's so cold
in the light of day #

356
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,951
# Turn me on #

357
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,650
# Turn me on #

358
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:45,186
# Like a neon light
that never fade away #

359
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,758
Ow!

360
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,615
# Every neon night #

361
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,252
# Burns away #

362
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,258
# Turn me on #

363
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,129
# Turn me on #

364
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,895
# Like a neon light #

365
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,299
# Turn me on #

366
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,033
# Turn me on #

367
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,734
# Like a neon light #

368
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:37,544
# That never
fades away ##

369
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,874
That's how those songs
were meant to be played.

370
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,409
That was fucking
awesome, man.

371
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,188
I knew the second Eric
played that ukulele of his

372
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,818
that Rose would swoon like
a little schoolgirl.

373
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,521
It was always
like that.

374
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,858
He could play one note

375
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,298
and get all the sweet
young things he wanted.

376
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,891
They'd line up,

377
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,994
drop their pretty
little panties for him.

378
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,573
You loved her?

379
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,576
Who?

380
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,442
Rose.

381
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,004
Please.

382
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,073
She was just another
hot piece of ass.

383
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,615
Don't print that.

384
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,121
Yeah...

385
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,875
All right, girls, time for
our favorite road game.

386
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,838
Name it.

387
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,679
"You Don't Have To Be A Star
(To Be In My Show)."

388
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,050
Marilyn McCoo
and Billy Davis, Jr.

389
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,188
# You don't have to be
a star baby #

390
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,729
Perfect.

391
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,356
# To be in my show #

392
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,729
- Oh, your show?
- Yeah.

393
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,961
Now we have the fucking
"Donny and Marie Show."

394
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,834
# You don't have to be
a star baby #

395
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,466
Oh, I used to
love this song.

396
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,669
Yeah, yeah,
not anymore, obviously.

397
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,312
Where the fuck
are we?

398
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,474
Ohio.

399
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,040
What the fuck's in Ohio?

400
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,608
There's a farm.

401
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,983
Breakfast.

402
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,453
Breakfast.

403
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,692
No, no, no, this is
a fucking truck stop.

404
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,929
They got great showers,
though.

405
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,436
You want a token?

406
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,972
No, thank you.

407
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,837
You could use
a shower, dude.

408
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,671
How are those eggs?

409
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,069
Cold.

410
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,039
Well, hot damn.

411
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,603
I feel like a bright
new shiny penny.

412
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,309
So what's the plan,
Augie?

413
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,783
The plan is I'm tired
and I want a rest

414
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,444
so I'm gonna
go back to the RV.

415
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,148
And what the fuck are we
supposed to do, huh?

416
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:09,284
Well, they have a groovy
video-game-room thing.

417
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,885
And go play some
Space Invaders

418
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,328
or Planetoids
or hemorrhoids.

419
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,059
I suppose you have tokens
for that, too?

420
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,101
No, you're on your own.

421
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,574
I would light
that ass up, I'll tell ya.

422
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,044
Millstone.

423
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,376
Hey, Ace, it's Rose, hi.

424
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,345
I can barely
hear you.

425
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,575
Where are you?

426
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,413
You were supposed to be
back here days ago

427
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,747
with that
fucking money pit

428
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,753
you call a band.

429
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,255
Yep, we're actually...
we're on the road now.

430
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,884
So, um, we'll be heading
back to you shortly.

431
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,393
In two weeks
I wash my hands of you

432
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,622
and that cokehead boyfriend
of yours.

433
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,187
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Whatever.

434
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,459
It's been over a year.

435
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,296
Where's my fucking songs?

436
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,369
You will have
your songs.

437
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,431
Two weeks!

438
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,239
Two weeks!

439
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,676
Bye.

440
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,438
Goddamn truck-stop food,
huh?

441
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,252
You're great.

442
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,927
I spoke to Ace.

443
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:52,758
And?

444
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,633
And he's
a fucking asshole.

445
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,137
If we don't get back to LA,

446
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,903
get in the studio
with some songs,

447
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,910
we can kiss the fucking
record deal good-bye,

448
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,741
the advance good-bye...
everything, okay?

449
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:09,939
We're done, finished.

450
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,482
You don't think
I fucking know this?

451
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,074
Why the fuck do you think
I'm dragging your ass

452
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,086
all the way
across the country?

453
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,123
Hey.

454
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,991
Rosie?

455
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,394
Hey.

456
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,196
I mean, I already brought
you back to that

457
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,296
godforsaken place,
and what do we get, huh?

458
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,169
This.

459
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,503
Fucking beautiful.

460
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,739
Good morning,
my little pretties.

461
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,942
You're melting,
you're melting.

462
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,281
Ah, here come
our fellow travelers.

463
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,980
Fireworks, baby.

464
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,521
Yeah, load up, guys.

465
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,988
We gotta get to
Chicago.

466
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,285
What the fuck's in Chicago?

467
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,089
Chicago is where
Route 66 begins.

468
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,062
Ta-da!

469
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,495
Let's load 'em up.

470
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,530
Truck stops.

471
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,696
Fucking Route 66.

472
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,502
Now we got...
"Name That Tune."

473
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,803
Are you fucking
kidding me?

474
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,434
Fuck!

475
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,309
By the way, how's your
writing going, maestro?

476
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,748
Lovebirds.

477
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,943
You fucking
make me sick!

478
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,211
Whoa.

479
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:28,919
Route 66 was officially
taken off the map in 1985.

480
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,325
I was on this dysfunctional
family road trip

481
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:35,127
headed to a road that
didn't even exist anymore.

482
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,532
He telling me we chose
our own fate.

483
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,695
Our destiny.

484
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,999
Come on.

485
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,562
All right, my pretties.

486
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,471
It's time for
our favorite game.

487
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,634
No, no, no.

488
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,439
We're not playing this
fucking game anyone!

489
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,313
You know what?

490
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,541
Try me one more time,
try me.

491
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,140
Okay, hold on,
hold on, here we go.

492
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,346
Um...

493
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,549
Professor Rock up here.

494
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,263
Shut the fuck up!

495
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,765
- Shut up!
- Come on, man, get it right!

496
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,232
- Get one right!
- We're waiting, Professor.

497
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,700
Fuck, I know this one.

498
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,929
Um...

499
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:15,564
Neil Young,
that's who it is.

500
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,504
It's Neil Young.

501
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,001
Whatever,
fuck your game.

502
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,602
Don't you know any music,
Spyder?

503
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,668
It's America.

504
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,271
I'm sorry, Rose,
I'm sorry.

505
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,816
I should have
fucking known that.

506
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,681
It's America.

507
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,448
My dial's not tuned in to
the adult contemporary version

508
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,988
of my fucking stereo.

509
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,080
I'm really sorry.

510
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,216
Oh, adult
contemporary music.

511
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,227
- Whoa.
- He got you, Augie.

512
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,489
That's pretty heavy.

513
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,334
Hey, Spyder.

514
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,800
It's America!

515
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,961
Check it out.

516
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,636
I always seemed to end up
in the front seat

517
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,576
next to that guy.

518
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,046
Looking back,
I don't really know

519
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,015
what I was searching for
up there.

520
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,353
Make a right up here.

521
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,724
Why?

522
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,059
'Cause I'm not sleeping in
this piece-of-shit RV again.

523
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,395
Oh, whatever you want,
little lady.

524
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,521
What, do you
want a shot?

525
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,524
Two best friends
right here.

526
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,460
So, um, what... what...

527
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,192
So what about
this chick?

528
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,770
Have you seen Spyder?

529
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,810
No, not since
we checked in.

530
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,005
I'm gonna play this song
for him.

531
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,251
What the fuck
are you looking at?

532
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,388
Huh?

533
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:24,868
You and your "everything's
gonna be okay" happy pills.

534
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,463
What are you up to now,
like 20 a day?

535
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,997
How long have you had
that habit, huh, Eric?

536
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,805
So what, I do a little blow
every now and then.

537
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:37,143
Get fucking over it!

538
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,775
Quit looking
at me like that!

539
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,945
I'm... I just wanted to play
you the new song

540
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,956
I was working on, but...

541
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,527
Fuck.

542
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,629
Fuck.

543
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,361
Where's Spyder?

544
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,234
Uh, he's busy.

545
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,704
Fuck him, come on.

546
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,812
Look at yourself.

547
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:49,785
Broken, mangled.

548
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,879
You freak.

549
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,925
Not now, not now.

550
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,983
Leave me
the fuck alone!

551
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,625
He was right.

552
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,291
You are a loser.

553
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,463
You never
amounted to shit.

554
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,596
Fuck off!

555
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,503
You missed.

556
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,742
My face...

557
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,076
My skull...

558
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,986
No talent, no family,
no friends.

559
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,253
I have friends.

560
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,225
I have friends.

561
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,818
Oh, yeah?

562
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,261
Why don't you name one

563
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,356
that you haven't stabbed in
the back or fucked over.

564
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,663
It's okay, I'll wait.

565
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,013
Where do you think
you're going?

566
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,551
Uh...

567
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:33,847
No?

568
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,285
Hey... hey, man,
you wanna...

569
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,694
you want to get down from
there so we can talk?

570
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,698
What are you
doing, man?

571
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,432
It's all right, man.

572
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,835
Come...

573
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,438
I went to go see him
when I was at home.

574
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,343
Easy, man.

575
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,989
I couldn't do it.

576
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,260
I couldn't do it.

577
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,330
I got this for
my 18th birthday.

578
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,775
Pops decided to toast life
on my face that night.

579
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,272
Over there
by those stairs.

580
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,586
So you're estranged
from your parents?

581
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,058
He's dead.

582
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,090
The only thing he gave me
was this, uh...

583
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,099
...beautiful face
and this house.

584
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,439
I never
knew my mother.

585
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,306
She was, um...

586
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,607
smart enough to get out.

587
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,582
She left when I was...
when I was...

588
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,347
What the fuck is this?

589
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,090
This is why
I don't do interviews.

590
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,394
Don't...

591
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,832
Don't print any of this.

592
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,028
We're supposed to be
talking about

593
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,661
the road trip and Eric.

594
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,228
How about we talk about
the third album?

595
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,534
- Fuck!
- Where is it?

596
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,841
Enough.

597
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,779
You're wasting my time.

598
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,249
You're wasting
your time on...

599
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,056
...on this for
ten years.

600
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,094
Oh, am I wasting
your time?

601
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,594
Huh?

602
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,679
Where were we?

603
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,288
Shoot!

604
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,120
Thank God.

605
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,719
Hand me the eight-track,
please.

606
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:00,661
What?

607
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,221
The eight-track.

608
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,930
What the fuck is this?

609
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,699
It's an antique.

610
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,173
It's a fucking
classic, man.

611
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,210
Shit.

612
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,710
Dorkwad.

613
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,007
Guess Who.

614
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,244
I already told you,
I'm not playing this

615
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,649
fucking game anymore.

616
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,915
No, the band
Guess Who.

617
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,320
Come on, man.

618
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,624
- Come on!
- Come on!

619
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,257
Come on,
I'll show you mine!

620
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,563
- Come on!
- Come on!

621
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,126
- Come on!
- Yeah!

622
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,670
Whoo!

623
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,510
Whoo!

624
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,073
Yeah, rock and roll!

625
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,282
Fuck you!

626
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,159
You know your music.

627
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,753
Uh, yeah, why do you
sound so surprised?

628
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,799
Oh, I took you
for one of those

629
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,130
could-be, wanna-be
record producers,

630
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,397
arrangers, managers...

631
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,166
know-nothing-about-music
types.

632
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,206
No offense.

633
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,433
All right, no,
that's interesting.

634
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,907
'Cause I, uh...

635
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,878
I kind of took you
as an over-the-hill,

636
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,915
really dirty old man

637
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,473
who has overstayed his welcome
in the industry

638
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,916
just a little too long,

639
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,386
and, you know, hangs out
with younger kids.

640
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,788
Catches a glimpse
of "T" and "A" when you can.

641
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,986
I mean, no offense.

642
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,586
No offense taken.

643
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,826
If I didn't love
the music, man...

644
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,061
I wouldn't be here.

645
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,070
Yeah.

646
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,917
What is he doing?

647
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,691
Spyder, what the fuck
are you doing?

648
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,085
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

649
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,295
- Fuck you!
- Fuck off!

650
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,562
Spyder!

651
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,605
Just having a bit
of fun.

652
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,537
That's not the fucking
Boy Scouts.

653
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,132
Pull over now!

654
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,268
So ridiculous.

655
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,244
You're a bunch of
fucking pansy-ass,

656
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,803
leather-wearing pussies!

657
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,609
Damn it!

658
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:32,740
Whoo!

659
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,716
Fuck you!

660
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,714
You're fucking
kidding me right now!

661
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,348
Suck my dick,
you fucking loser!

662
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,618
Cocksucker!

663
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,659
Whoo!

664
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,624
Fuck you!

665
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,218
Whoo!

666
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,663
Goddamn motherfucker!

667
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,926
Oh...

668
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,092
You're fucked!

669
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,726
Everybody get down!

670
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:53,633
Cocksucker!

671
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,864
Hang on!

672
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,945
What the fuck
are you thinking?

673
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,140
You're a moron,
grow up.

674
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,206
That's not
fucking funny, man.

675
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,275
Jesus Christ.

676
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,550
Oh, Eric, why don't you go
sit down and play guitar?

677
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,715
Oh, my God!

678
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,605
Augie, what are we
doing here?

679
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,076
Visiting.

680
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,806
Visiting who?

681
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,108
An old friend.

682
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,205
Here we go again!

683
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,342
Ah shit,
we're gonna die.

684
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,783
Augie, what's going on,
who lives here?

685
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,377
An old flame.

686
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,114
She loved me.

687
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,325
What's your business here,
motherfucker!

688
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,260
Well...

689
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,991
let's see how I can
rectify this.

690
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,337
It's me.

691
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,275
It's Augustus, Maggie.

692
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,404
Of course, I know it's you,
you rat bastard.

693
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,472
Why do you
think I'm firing?

694
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,278
I'd recognize that
piece-of-shit RV

695
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,512
in a trailer park
full of 'em.

696
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:17,986
Aw, come on.

697
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,955
Maggie, that's...
that's the peerless Rita.

698
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,651
She's a classic.

699
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,455
Uh, uh, now,
Maggie...

700
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,792
My little pearl of light.

701
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,890
"Pearl of light."

702
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,559
My ass!

703
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:35,969
What do you want
and need from me, Augie?

704
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,167
Don't tell me.

705
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,233
There's a band
in there.

706
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,871
And you want to,
like, you know... crash.

707
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,209
I'm not a cook.

708
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,443
Maggie,
it's the peerless Rita.

709
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,351
How could I fit a band
in there?

710
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,513
Please.

711
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,021
It's good to see
you again, Margaret.

712
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:12,198
You... bastard.

713
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,937
That's pretty rough,
Maggie.

714
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,614
You're really driving
across country

715
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,879
in that thing
with all these guys?

716
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,045
Yep.

717
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,783
It's not so bad, though.

718
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,223
They're all
a bunch of pussycats.

719
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,420
I've dealt with
much worse.

720
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,156
Haven't we all?

721
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,630
You got a window blown out
in my Airstream.

722
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,132
Now if you want to
entertain yourself

723
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,601
with a big rush
or even kill yourself,

724
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,262
do it on your own
fucking time.

725
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,464
What is this, huh?

726
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,131
Some kind of
intervention?

727
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,368
Once you've lightened up
on the sauce,

728
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,205
you think
the party's over, huh?

729
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,905
There's nothing worse than
a reformed whore.

730
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,850
Just don't violate
the cardinal rule,

731
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,012
and you'll be all right.

732
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,521
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,855
So what's
the cardinal rule?

734
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,325
Never get your
emotions involved,

735
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,918
and they can't hurt you.

736
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,759
Oh, I know.

737
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,822
I know all about that.

738
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,333
Fucking waste of space.

739
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,202
What?

740
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,262
Would you lay off him?

741
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,308
He's driving us
across the country.

742
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,366
Are you fucking
kidding me?

743
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,139
You know what,
fuck you, I'm out of here.

744
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,577
Fuck you, too.

745
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,342
Asshole.

746
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,848
Spyder, where are
you going?

747
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,283
Just let him go.

748
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,411
I'm gonna go inside

749
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,455
so I can finish
working on this song.

750
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,547
Hey.

751
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,707
What you writing?

752
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,751
Just some song.

753
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,684
What's your song about?

754
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:15,629
Play it for me.

755
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,765
Are you scared?

756
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,286
Chip's kid.

757
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,156
- Wow.
- Yeah.

758
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:23,030
I remember running around
with you guys.

759
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,558
It was... just like
it was yesterday.

760
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,437
I think I'm really
falling for you.

761
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,844
Did you hear
what I said to you?

762
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,287
It's that Spyder dude.

763
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,020
Wow, he's a...

764
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,922
He's unpredictable.

765
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,960
You're calling someone
unpredictable.

766
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,834
Man, now you sound old.

767
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,741
It must have been really
cool growing up in...

768
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,848
...in your dad's house.

769
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,350
Well, it wasn't.

770
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:52,513
What?

771
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,580
Now, what are you
talking about?

772
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,321
Oh, man...

773
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:03,423
Your dad was
a punk-rock legend.

774
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,401
A legend?

775
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,962
Yeah, it's real hard to
play three fucking chords.

776
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,270
Three fucking chords?

777
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,309
Three fucking chords.

778
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,708
You're...

779
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,976
That was great music.

780
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,540
Look, I said I didn't want to
talk about it, okay?

781
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,820
Are you okay?

782
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,186
What's wrong?

783
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:30,158
Honey, what's wrong?

784
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,285
Eric?

785
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,361
Has anyone seen Spyder?

786
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,596
Oh, hey.

787
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,968
No, he, um...

788
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,337
he didn't come back.

789
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,466
All right,
I'm gonna go look for him.

790
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,533
You want to take
the truck?

791
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:48,771
Thanks.

792
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,662
Get in!

793
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,033
Fuck off!

794
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,222
What the fuck
is your problem?

795
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,518
I don't have a problem.

796
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,149
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

797
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,851
Okay, fine.

798
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,761
You want to know what?

799
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,299
You want to know what
my fucking problem is?

800
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,890
- Yeah, I do.
- You, you.

801
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,267
You fucking Shanghai me,
my band.

802
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,602
Take me on this fucking
old-school road trip.

803
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:51,971
And for what, huh?

804
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,203
For your songs,
for your blessed songs.

805
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,744
Well, you know what,
fuck you.

806
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,143
I don't need your
fucking songs.

807
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,476
- Oh, you don't?
- I don't need them!

808
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,277
Somehow I think you do need
them, you fuck.

809
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,510
What was "Snake Oil," huh?

810
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,678
The biggest rock
debut album of all time.

811
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,414
Who wrote those
songs, huh?

812
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,389
Yeah, I wrote those songs.

813
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,618
So you put on some fucking
makeup and added a dance beat.

814
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:10,990
Don't... I wrote
those songs.

815
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,028
Those were my songs!

816
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,494
What difference
does it make, huh?

817
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,825
What difference
does it make?

818
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:15,990
You bitched out!

819
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,158
You bitched out!

820
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,997
You would've sat in that
fucking basement of yours

821
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,195
and done nothing
with it.

822
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,465
I took them,
I fucking made those songs.

823
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:23,506
I made them!

824
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:24,835
So what happened on your
second album?

825
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,069
With all of your
fucking songs, huh?

826
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:27,940
It sucked!

827
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,103
By all accounts!

828
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,840
- Everyone hated it!
- Fuck you, fuck you!

829
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,212
You didn't have my demo
to steal that from.

830
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,250
Did you?

831
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,545
And I never said anything!

832
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,780
You were on the cover of
every fucking magazine!

833
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,617
My songs were on
every radio station!

834
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,122
You didn't want to come!

835
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,385
You didn't want to
come with me!

836
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,858
You left me!

837
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,787
I... I would have gone.

838
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,395
Bullshit.

839
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,561
I would have!

840
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,535
I would have.

841
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,735
That's bullshit.

842
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,274
- That is fucking bullshit.
- No!

843
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,400
If you would have just waited,
I would have...

844
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:01,944
That is...

845
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,845
That is bullshit because your
mother would've never let you

846
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,439
fucking follow
in your dad's footsteps.

847
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,949
Are you kidding me?

848
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,612
She never let you five feet
away from her fucking titty!

849
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,918
What did you just
say to me?

850
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,457
Don't you fucking
talk about my dad

851
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,516
or my fucking mom!

852
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,266
Enough, enough!

853
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,212
Get in the fucking truck,
Herman.

854
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,090
Finally.

855
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,131
You're still a pussy.

856
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,570
I kicked your ass.

857
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,386
Are you two boys just gonna
stand there all night?

858
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,220
Why don't
you come on in,

859
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,658
get yourselves
a drink?

860
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,319
Hey.

861
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,990
What's up there, mama?

862
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,364
It's a nice place
you got here.

863
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,663
What can I get you?

864
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,034
Uh... shit,
I'm thinking beer.

865
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:12,131
Uh, Budweiser and
a shot of Jack.

866
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,301
- Bud?
- Yeah.

867
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,210
Uh...

868
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,382
Actually, I asked for...

869
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,324
Never mind.

870
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,091
So, this is
a blues joint, huh?

871
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,361
A real blues joint?

872
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,733
Mm-hmm.

873
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,101
If you really
want to hear the blues,

874
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,639
I mean, really hear
the blues,

875
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,174
you give this kid a guitar.

876
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,766
This guy lives
and breathes the blues.

877
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,141
The blues?

878
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,476
Is that so?

879
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:52,480
That's a fact.

880
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:53,379
Spyder.

881
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,712
No, don't listen to him.

882
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,012
Hey, Sonny Boy.

883
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,110
Yes, Ma'am?

884
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,155
You hear that?

885
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:03,750
He says this cat
can play us the blues.

886
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,795
Spyder,
what are you doing?

887
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,887
No, don't listen to him.

888
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:08,828
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

889
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,058
I mean, look at him.

890
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,498
Payback's a bitch.

891
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,502
Three notes,
can you play that tune?

892
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:17,136
You know what, Miss Candy,

893
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,538
for some strange
reason,

894
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,075
I kind of... I kind of believe

895
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,907
this little
Frankenstein-looking white boy.

896
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,241
Thank you.

897
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,782
Asshole.

898
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,921
We got the blues
this morning!

899
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,021
That's good.

900
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,656
Can I get another one
of those?

901
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,961
Mr. Pinetop Perkins

902
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,468
got some blues
for you this morning.

903
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,970
You okay?

904
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,232
Yeah, what is that?

905
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,432
Oh, my God, dude.

906
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,500
Uh-oh.

907
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,102
All right,
here you go.

908
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,614
Let's see what you got.

909
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,706
Go on now.

910
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,516
What are you
boys doing in here?

911
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,817
Bring it with you
when you come, son.

912
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,380
Where you all from?

913
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,891
Uh...

914
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,517
Far, far away.

915
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,891
Thank you.

916
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,792
Hey, uh, Spyder.

917
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,197
Get up here, you're gonna
do it, too.

918
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,394
Nope.

919
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,834
Does anyone want that guy
to come up here and sing?

920
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,667
Oh, hell, yes.

921
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:23,706
Give him a chance.

922
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,400
No, no, no.

923
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,170
Let's see what
you can do, Spyder.

924
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,981
So, what the fuck
am I supposed to do, huh?

925
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,983
Uh...

926
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,211
It's okay, son.

927
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,913
Just like playing
with your friends.

928
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,651
Hey, uh...

929
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,089
"Train Kept A-Rollin"'?

930
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,285
Sweet, Aerosmith.

931
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,554
- Aero-who?
- Aerosmith?

932
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,493
- What?
- Tiny Bradshaw, homey.

933
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,091
All right, ready?

934
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,436
# Aboard a train #

935
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,412
# I met a dame #

936
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,574
# She kinda handsome #

937
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,549
# We kinda
looked the same #

938
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,381
# She was pretty #

939
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,978
# From New York City #

940
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:16,890
# Walking down
that lane #

941
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,518
# I'm in heat #

942
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,586
# I'm in love #

943
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,894
# But I just
couldn't tell her so #

944
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,946
They're all right.

945
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,422
Burn, baby, burn!

946
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,212
# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

947
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,773
# All night long #

948
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,115
# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

949
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,313
# All night long #

950
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,879
One more round.

951
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:26,155
# But I just couldn't
tell her no #

952
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,462
All right.

953
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,225
Yeah.

954
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,202
# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

955
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,747
# All night long #

956
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,113
# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

957
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,651
# All night long #

958
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,380
# I'm in heat #

959
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:52,751
# I'm in love ##

960
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,330
Did you see me?

961
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,872
Did that really
just happen?

962
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,431
Oh my God!

963
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:14,498
Hello!

964
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:23,578
Hi!

965
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,550
Uh-oh.

966
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,186
Where were you?

967
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,192
Huh?

968
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,525
I've been sitting here
all night.

969
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:35,757
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?

970
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,665
Looks like somebody's
got an old lady.

971
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,259
But you didn't
miss me, Rosie?

972
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:41,598
- No, not at all, asshole.
- No?

973
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:42,933
- No.
- Oh, no.

974
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:45,031
Fuck off.

975
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,042
What the fuck, Eric?

976
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,910
- What, what are you...
- What's going on?

977
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,074
- I mean, what?
- Yeah, yeah, uh...

978
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,913
I don't get it.

979
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,145
I don't get it
either.

980
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,812
I don't...
I don't understand.

981
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,253
Eric.

982
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,381
Don't deal
with this, then.

983
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:04,517
Fucker.

984
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,428
Rita's rolling right after
breakfast, guys.

985
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,434
Oh, boy.

986
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:28,315
Oh, I fucked up.

987
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,352
I fucked up.

988
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,980
You really thought Aerosmith
wrote "Train Kept A-Rollin"'?

989
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,789
I already told you.

990
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:43,195
Eric was the blues guy
and music freak.

991
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,996
The one with
all the knowledge.

992
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,765
But something happened on
the stage that night.

993
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,396
Magic.

994
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,371
Like we were supposed to

995
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:58,175
find that joint
and have that experience.

996
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:06,083
After that, things just...

997
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,383
fell into place.

998
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,328
# Blackout
in the basement #

999
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,300
# There's noise in
the garage #

1000
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,131
# Been drowned in
sound and vision #

1001
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,263
# Was it only a mirage? #

1002
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,364
# And keep my head
out of the sand #

1003
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,375
# I see you as you are #

1004
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,172
# Me I'm here
on solid ground #

1005
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,439
# And you in darkness #

1006
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,572
# Floating like a star #

1007
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,542
# You drifted too far #

1008
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,050
# Without you #

1009
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,057
# I slip and fall #

1010
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,184
# But I won't crawl #

1011
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,659
# Break down the wall #

1012
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:48,060
# With or without you #

1013
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,031
# One more drink #

1014
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,090
# It's not what
you think #

1015
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:53,692
# I'm gone in a blink #

1016
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,034
# With or without you #

1017
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,005
# Slip and fall #

1018
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,599
# And I won't crawl #

1019
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,377
- Fuck you!
- Fuck!

1020
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,883
# I'll ride around this
fucking world #

1021
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,855
# I'll drive
a million miles #

1022
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,017
# But home is always
in my head #

1023
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,890
# A lost forgotten child #

1024
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,929
# Another place
another pretty face #

1025
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,692
# Whatever I can find #

1026
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,700
# Some temporary ecstasy #

1027
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,032
# To help me
lose my mind #

1028
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,937
# When your star
don't shine #

1029
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,739
# Without you #

1030
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,609
# I slip and fall #

1031
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,773
# But I won't crawl #

1032
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,282
# Break down the wall #

1033
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,682
# With or without you #

1034
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,516
# One more drink #

1035
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,556
# It's not what
you think #

1036
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:49,250
# I'm gone in a blink #

1037
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,725
# With or without you #

1038
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:53,557
# Get what you give #

1039
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:56,120
# It's my time to live #

1040
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,067
# Yeah man #

1041
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,371
# It's my time #

1042
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,652
# Without you #

1043
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,487
# Listen #

1044
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,423
# Without you #

1045
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,456
# I'm going #

1046
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,157
# I'm going #

1047
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,359
# I'm going #

1048
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:34,460
# I'm gonna run #

1049
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,991
# Without you #

1050
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,120
# I slip and I fall #

1051
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,188
# But I won't crawl #

1052
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,824
# Break down the wall #

1053
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,028
# With or without you #

1054
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,003
# One more drink #

1055
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,005
# It's not what
you think #

1056
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,631
# I'm gone in a blink #

1057
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:15,108
# Now I'm without you #

1058
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,008
# Slip and fall #

1059
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,979
# But I won't crawl #

1060
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,811
# I got it all #

1061
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,908
# With or without you #

1062
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,976
# You get what
you give #

1063
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,955
# It's my time to live ##

1064
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,940
I did New York to
LA in 51 hours.

1065
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,445
That's insane.

1066
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,142
Steinbeck said that nature
put a desert

1067
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:57,845
in front of
California to test a man.

1068
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,945
Test what?

1069
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,887
His will.

1070
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,722
To see if he was good enough
to get to California.

1071
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:17,804
Why are we stopping?

1072
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,738
Because I need to rest.

1073
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:24,805
So you really knew
Jimi Hendrix, huh?

1074
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,348
Yeah.

1075
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,008
Cafe Wha? Days.

1076
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,194
Oh, thanks, man.

1077
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,275
Do you know we're missing
a huge part

1078
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,335
of the human story?

1079
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,074
No, I didn't know, no.

1080
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:03,642
Like we're living in
a massive case of amnesia.

1081
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:04,686
What?

1082
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:07,552
No, l...
are we free?

1083
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,250
I don't know.

1084
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,122
Do we know
who we are?

1085
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,093
Y'know, where we
came from?

1086
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,392
Spyder, what are you
talking about?

1087
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,863
No, are we free?

1088
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:20,299
Or are we just in a...

1089
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,599
prison, a fucking prison,
you know?

1090
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,400
With no bars
and no walls.

1091
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,497
Nothing.

1092
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:28,099
Just this...

1093
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,701
distraction.

1094
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,974
This distraction
from distraction

1095
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:36,212
from the fucking
distraction.

1096
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,183
That's what I think.

1097
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,488
What... what did Maggie
put in this shit?

1098
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,394
I'm going to bed.

1099
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,329
You all right?

1100
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,991
Yeah.

1101
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:54,764
Get some sleep.

1102
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:55,861
Sweet dreams.

1103
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,405
Good night, Spyder.

1104
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,777
That's good.

1105
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,677
- Let's get out of here.
- It's a full moon.

1106
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,046
Toodle-oo.

1107
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,177
Toodle-oo.

1108
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,731
Okay, so play me a song.

1109
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,635
Okay.

1110
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,228
Yeah, I got
a song for you.

1111
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:39,339
# It's a lonely planet
joy when #

1112
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:42,509
# You bring the songs
from the other boys #

1113
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:43,916
# That's right #

1114
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,819
# I'm a lonely planet boy #

1115
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,982
# And I'm trying #

1116
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,819
# Baby for your love #

1117
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,555
# Whoa, whoa, whoa
yeah #

1118
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,371
# You pick me up #

1119
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:08,433
# You're out
driving in your car #

1120
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:12,311
# When I tell you
where I'm going #

1121
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:16,340
# You're always telling me
it's too far #

1122
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:20,855
# But how could
you be driving #

1123
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:24,154
# Down by my home #

1124
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:29,027
# When you know
that I ain't got one #

1125
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,861
# And I'm #

1126
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:34,460
# I'm so all alone ##

1127
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,333
Yay, I love that song.

1128
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:50,852
So we made
the mythic journey.

1129
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,854
Eric got what he wanted.

1130
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,048
And you?

1131
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,353
Did you get
what you wanted?

1132
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,729
# Sweet rock candy #

1133
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,129
# Sweet rock candy ##

1134
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:31,720
And that's all she wrote.

1135
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,557
Beautiful, guys,
really great.

1136
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,222
Thank you so much, man.

1137
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:37,890
It's been...
I can't believe it.

1138
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,332
A pleasure, baby,
pleasure.

1139
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,164
- Eric... Eric.
- Yeah?

1140
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,000
Come here for a second,
I gotta show you something.

1141
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,130
Come on.

1142
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,214
This is for you.

1143
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,712
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

1144
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,723
Do you like it?

1145
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:03,723
Like it?

1146
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,690
It's fucking beautiful.

1147
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,886
Where did
you get this?

1148
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,054
I got some guy,
you know.

1149
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,859
- You got some guy?
- Hop in.

1150
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,763
Go on, open it up,
it's right there.

1151
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,504
Oh, my God.

1152
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:21,502
This is mine?

1153
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,875
Yep.

1154
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,608
Oh, my God.

1155
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,047
All right, you get
out of here, okay?

1156
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,711
- PCH awaits.
- Oh, my God.

1157
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,378
I mean, you're gonna be at
my party tonight, right?

1158
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,716
- My place?
- Yeah.

1159
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,689
I mean, I'll check my, uh...

1160
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,248
Fucking dickhead.

1161
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,691
Here.

1162
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,490
Uh...

1163
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:48,230
Thanks, Eric.

1164
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,304
Thank you.

1165
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,536
Get the fuck
out of here, asshole.

1166
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,509
All right.

1167
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:57,806
Go on.

1168
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,745
Oh, God.

1169
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,146
That sounds nice.

1170
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,555
# Baby when
I watch you walk #

1171
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,559
# Make me wanna weep #

1172
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:14,152
# Oh babe
the way you talk #

1173
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,254
# It keeps me from my sleep #

1174
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,199
# I want your
sweet rock candy #

1175
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:24,702
# I can't barely stand it #

1176
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:30,671
# Come on over
come see what I got #

1177
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:36,148
# Come on over baby
I'm running hot #

1178
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,152
# Please, please honey #

1179
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,453
# Be my baby #

1180
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,460
# Be my baby #

1181
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,019
# Sweet, sweet honey #

1182
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,532
# Be my baby #

1183
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,898
# Be my baby ##

1184
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,509
Nice view.

1185
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,663
No!

1186
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:32,772
Los Angeles!

1187
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:37,806
So la-ta!

1188
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,338
Oh, hey.

1189
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,039
So good.

1190
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:16,310
Excuse you, party boy.

1191
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,252
Of course, it's good.

1192
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,223
It's the pink stuff.

1193
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,487
Pure uncut.

1194
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:28,724
Nothing says you're back
on top like pink cocaine.

1195
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,594
Oh, we're back on top.

1196
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,258
Why?

1197
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,665
Because of me.

1198
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,203
Rosie is on it.

1199
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,829
That's right,
hits for days,

1200
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,271
hits for days.

1201
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,468
My baby's wrote a hit.

1202
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:45,945
A hit.

1203
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,606
So proud.

1204
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:48,513
So proud.

1205
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,511
- I told you, didn't I?
- What?

1206
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:53,748
That I'd take care of you.

1207
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,818
I take care of you.

1208
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,021
I took care of you.

1209
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,290
Guys.

1210
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:03,490
I'll take care of you
right now.

1211
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,032
- What?
- Fuck it.

1212
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,761
I said, fuck it.

1213
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,735
- Not this again.
- Oh, yes.

1214
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,602
It's been so long,
baby.

1215
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:12,901
Here, give me some.

1216
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:20,774
Oh.

1217
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,913
Bad, you're bad, you're bad,
you're bad.

1218
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,418
What so-la top?

1219
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:30,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1220
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,388
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah!

1221
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:33,826
Yeah, good time.

1222
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:54,710
Oh, man.

1223
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,251
This is unbelievable.

1224
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,287
Have you guys
seen Spyder?

1225
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,254
Yeah, he's in the back
over there.

1226
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,051
- That way?
- Yeah.

1227
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,170
Ow!

1228
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,802
Okay, okay,
I got it!

1229
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:30,815
Look...

1230
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,080
Look.

1231
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,622
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God.

1232
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,918
Eric.

1233
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,458
Eric, it...

1234
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,792
Eric!

1235
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,990
Eric.

1236
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,761
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh...

1237
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,403
Tell him.

1238
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,963
Oh, fuck, Eric!

1239
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:04,577
Yeah!

1240
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,655
Eric!

1241
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,226
He made me.

1242
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,286
- Eric!
- What's up?

1243
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,117
Wait, wait, wait, Eric!

1244
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,934
What the fuck's going on?

1245
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,541
Well?

1246
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,380
Now what the fuck
did you do?

1247
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:14,012
Answer me, asshole!

1248
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,023
What the fuck
did you do now?

1249
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,589
Get in the house.

1250
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:24,188
Go in the fucking
house!

1251
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:39,914
Fuck!

1252
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,598
Fucked up,
fucked up!

1253
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:05,599
You really like him.

1254
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,491
And here we are.

1255
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,336
Here we are.

1256
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:18,343
If you listen
very carefully...

1257
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:20,643
pay attention to
the notes...

1258
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:22,808
the sound...

1259
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:26,320
they way he...

1260
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:29,380
the fingers sliding up
and down the strings...

1261
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:37,264
it's like there's a...

1262
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,028
eulogy buried in
every blues song.

1263
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,802
Did you really think
that you could just

1264
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:46,397
run away from all this?

1265
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:52,537
I invited you here,
didn't I?

1266
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:54,479
In my home.

1267
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,312
Didn't I?

1268
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,045
And why did you
call me here?

1269
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,816
When no one's seen or heard
from you in, what, 20 years?

1270
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,518
Is there a third album?

1271
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:07,494
Who was Eric Genson?

1272
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:11,157
He was like my brother.

1273
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,098
And then
he was gone.

1274
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,672
Just like that.

1275
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,477
And I...

1276
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,084
And I read,
and I read...

1277
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,385
No answers.

1278
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:42,953
None.

1279
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:58,506
All the great ones
died at 27.

1280
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,048
Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin,

1281
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:04,313
Brian Jones, Kurt Cobain,

1282
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:07,719
Jim Morrison, Robert Johnson.

1283
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:15,355
Most men live lives of
quiet desperation

1284
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,456
and go to the grave
with the song still in them.

1285
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,449
You take those.

1286
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:18,088
Please.

1287
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:27,831
Okay.

1288
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,287
Cliff...

1289
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:54,621
Thank you.
