Here. Enjoy.
Yeah, Grandpa ?

1174
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:31,495
Grandpa, I can't take this.
Bev's your girl.

1175
01:24:31,534 --> 01:24:34,574
She's too young for me.

1176
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:36,813
Man, this is gonna be
so cool at parties.

1177
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:41,479
And don't forget me.
I want to hear from you.

1178
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:44,250
[ Lance ]
Don't worry. You will.

1179
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,480
- I'll call you
from Frisco, Pop.
- Where are you gonna be ?

1180
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:49,746
Oh, you can find me
at Lance's.

1181
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:55,315
I mean, uh, my dad's.

1182
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:58,188
Take care of yourself.

1183
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:01,395
See ya, Uncle Moses !
See ya, bud.

1184
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:06,401
Good-bye.
Drive carefully.

[ Lance ]
Michael, did I ever tell you
that I love you ?

1186
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:17,282
[ Michael ]
Yeah, Dad, every day.
Every day.

[ Harry Reciting ]
I want a proper cup
of coffee...

1189
01:25:30,426 --> 01:25:34,896
made in a proper
copper-coated coffeepot.

1190
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:39,370
I find a teapot
of no use to me.

1191
01:25:39,402 --> 01:25:42,772
If I can't have
a proper cup of coffee...

1192
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:47,405
made in a proper
copper-coated coffeepot,

1193
01:25:47,443 --> 01:25:50,183
I'll have a cup of tea.

1194
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,550
Not bad, but I think
you need a little more lip work.

1195
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,724
Okay.

1196
01:25:57,753 --> 01:26:01,623
Let's start with
the happy pucker, okay ?
Okay.

* Is it just coincidence

1207
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:39,802
* I know
it doesn't make no sense *

1208
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:44,534
* Whistling a tune
with glee *

1209
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:48,444
* Me, myself, and I
makes three *

1210
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:51,768
* It doesn't take a scientist

1211
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,237
* To prove to me
that you're the best *

1212
01:26:54,277 --> 01:26:58,777
* It wouldn't change
the twinkle in your eyes *

* My heart
would find no melody *

1214
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,590
* I'd find myself
in jeopardy *

1215

in my life *

1216

* If I only were a king

1225

* All your fingers
would have rings *

1226
01:27:45,328 --> 01:27:49,468
* The biggest one
would spell your name *

1227
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:52,568

* Forever
you're the apple of me eye *

* My heart beats
like a timpani *

1232

* Accompanying the symphony

* That spins
our lives around *
