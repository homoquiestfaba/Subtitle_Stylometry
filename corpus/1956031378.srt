think about it too.

00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,938
Not always avoiding
getting arrested.

180
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,473
I like what I do.
I'm good at it.

181
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,709
- I enjoy it.
- Okay.

182
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,978
You know, it doesn't
make me less of a person

183
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,781
than someone with
some shitty office job.

184
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,449
Just means
I have more fun.

185
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,284
I'm not boring.

186
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,886
So how's work for you?

187
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,889
Hmm. Do you actually
wanna know?

188
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,124
I'm asking, aren't I?

189
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,760
Guys move locations
or something?

190
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,930
I didn't actually think
you were listening.

191
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,566
I'm a great listener.

192
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,802
Well, I like it. It's a little
farther from my house,

193
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,503
so it takes me
like 10 minutes longer.

194
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:11,276
You know, and with traffic,
it'd take like half an hour,

195
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,079
so yeah.

196
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,181
That's awesome.

Oh! Give it to me! Don't stop!

206

No. You talk too much
when you smoke.

207
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,251
- Harry, do you love me?
- What?

208
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,688
- What kind of question is that?
- Well, do you?

209
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,924
Let's go to bed.
You're acting silly.

210
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,904
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

211
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,376
Oh. Okay.

212
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,646
- That's it?
- What?

213
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,382
I tell you I'm leaving,
and you don't try to stop me

214
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,385
or ask me where I'm going?

215
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,187
Where are you going?

216
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,089
Can't believe I tried
to make this work, okay?

217
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,725
You're stupid and immature
and selfish,

218
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,628
and I can't do this anymore.

219
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,797
That-- That's it?

220
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,499
Yes, Harry, that's it!

221
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,667
- Oh.
- Leaving you.

222
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,869
If that's what you want.

223
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,205

What are these scratches
right there?

229
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,797
Those? Uh...

230
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,699
- From my dog.
- You have a dog?

231
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,135
Yeah, yeah, he's ferocious.

232
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:20,739
Yeah, he's sleeping.

233
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,174
All right, bro,
I'll take it.

234
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,748
Uh, let's go this way.
Come on.

235
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,916
Hey, so what kind of dog
do you have anyway?

236
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,318
These are pretty deep
scratches.

237
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,520
It's a cock-a-doodle poodle
Spaniard thing.

238
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,822
I got a dog too, you know.
It's a West Highland Terrier.

239
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,390
They're really cute, you know.

240
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,659
Actually, he's really good
with aggressive dogs.

241
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,094
Since you got
an aggressive, mean dog,

242
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,530
- we could take 'em out.
- Thanks.

243
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,800
Take them for a walk
to the park sometime, and...

244
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,069
All right, bro,
I'll catch you later.

245
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,249
Do you have the money
from the last one?

246
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,551
- What?
- From the last job.

247
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,952
Did you sell everything?

248
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,521
Yeah. What kinda
fucking question is that?

249
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,490
I'm just asking, man.
I wanna be done after today.

250
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,993
[sighs] You don't think
I'm gonna pay you?

251
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,528
I didn't say that.

252
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,729
I just don't wanna have
to ask for it later, man.

253
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,030
It's awkward.

254
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,165
For someone having
an awakening of morals,

255
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,966
you sure are money hungry.

256
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,836
You'll get your cash, okay?

257
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,371
We'll just do this one today,

258
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,107
and then you can
move on to your real job

259
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,942
and start popping out
a shitload of kids

260

figure out which car to take.

- I said wait.
- I wanna get this over with!

00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,366
I mean, honestly, what--
what is your plan here?

706
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:57,600
What?

707
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,903
I'm gonna kill myself, Harry.

708
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,205
I am, whether it be
tonight or tomorrow

709
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,374
or the day after that,
it's gonna happen.

710
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,409
And you can ramble at me
all you want,

711
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,777
and you can watch me
like a hawk,

712
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,512
but it's not gonna
change anything.

713
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,581
I don't wanna be here.
Why don't you get that?

714
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,583
- That's not true.
- It is true!

715
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,052
It is, and it's selfish of you
to make me stay.

716
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,854

And there's nothing
that you can do or say

728
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:49,986
that's gonna stop it
from happening.

729
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,789
Just stop making it
so fucking difficult.

00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,291

- Please just stop!

One condition.

735
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,102
You need a last meal.

736
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,271
- What?
- A last meal.

737
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,507

get a last meal.

with food?

Dude, you're like obsessed
or something.

you're the only person on Earth

Look, I'll cook for you,

746

and if you still wanna
kill yourself after, I'll leave.

Deal?

748
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,762

in some weird, fucked-up way?

- What?
- I don't know.

750

It just feels like you're
cooking me dinner and stuff.

751

- It's kind of...
- No, it's like you said.

752

- The food obsession thing.
- Okay.

Come on.

754
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,941
So all I have to do is eat.
That's it?

755
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,810
- That's it.
- And then you'll go away,

756
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,144

757
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,379
Yes.

fancy enough for you?

761

Yeah. Peter's a vegetarian,

in this house.

- No.
- Come on.

- Oh, God.

00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,173
what are you gonna do
after you die?

933
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:38,374
What do you mean?

934
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:41,610
Like what's your first stop?

935
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:42,878

936
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,180
Yeah.

937
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:45,915

like, afterlife?

938
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:47,683
Of course.

939
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,987
Do you actually believe
in all that stuff?

940
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,124
- What, like God?
- Yeah.

941
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,526
I think so.
I mean, don't you?

942
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,527
No.

943
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,999
So what's the meaning
of all this then?

944
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,600
See, I knew you were
gonna ask that.

945
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,035
Well?

946
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:08,371
The question doesn't
make any sense.

947
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:09,638
Why?

948
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,541
The question should be,
"How did we come to exist?"

949
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,343
Or, "What can we do
while we're here?"

950
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,979
To ask why we're here,
it's idiotic.

951
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:19,048
- There's no reason.
- No reason?

952
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,618
No. Humans spend
their entire life wondering,

953
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,953
"Why are we here?"

954
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:25,788
when in actuality,
we're just a bunch of monkeys

955
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,390
running around on a rock,

956
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:30,826
trying to have sex with each
other and not get blown up.

957
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,862
So you don't think anything
happens after you die?

958
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,864
No, it does.

959
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,299
It just doesn't involve me.

960
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:38,667
With an attitude like that,

961
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:41,504
I know why you wouldn't
wanna stay alive.

962
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:43,339
Hilarious.

963
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,108
So if you're an atheist,
I mean, why do you wanna die?

964
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,643
What's the difference?

965
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:50,780
Like most people, they get
something after all this.

966
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:53,015
As far as you're concerned,
this is it.

967
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:58,287
Why would you wanna give up
the one thing you'll ever have?

968
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,257
I just don't think
it's all that great.

969
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:04,994
So will you tell me why then?

970
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:06,896
Tell you what?

971
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,098
Why you wanna do it.

972
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,834
Why do you need to know
so badly?

973
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:14,003
I don't know.

974
00:51:14,005 --> 00:51:17,640

I suggest that you run,

Run while you can. Trust me!

It was nasty and stupid.

And, Peter,
you broke my heart, man.
