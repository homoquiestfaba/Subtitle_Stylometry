realized the effect

-But why not?

743
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:31,436
I thought the state of Virginia
declared him legally dead.

744
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:33,002
They did. Doesn't mean anything.

745

legal.

I'm gonna make him answer
to those girls.

They're entitled to

Well, through his former wife

I tracked him to San Antonio,

for that company anymore?
