1
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,442
Okay, Miss Mike, you're in.

2
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,365
Watch your ass.

3
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,448
Definitely Taliban presence here.

4
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,086
Not a lot, but they're here. Over.

5
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,568
If you see Bin Laden, You can
give him a big New York kiss.

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,291
Then chop his nuts off. He
can wear them as earrings.

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,283
Roger that.

8
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,888
Some old guy is making eyes at me.

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,801
God damn!

10
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,570
I can't see anything out of this.

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,762
You should bring that
outfit back to the States,

12
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,644
you can wear it again for Halloween.

13
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,206
Next time, you're wearing the dress.

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,846
Craig, I've got a
problem with the old guy.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,411
Take it easy.

16
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,647
He's not taking his eyes
off me, This guy knows.

17
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,962
I think he knows.
- Hang in there, Mike.

18
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,487
Control, we have an unexpected
visitor. Request positive I.D. Over.

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,931
Go.

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,083
Visitor is a friendly VIP.

21
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,044
Repeat, visitor is a CIA contractor.

22
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,128
Abort mission. Over.

23
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,686
This is not good. Craig, do you read?

24
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,211
I'm in deep shit, man.

25
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,163
The old man's ratting me out.

26
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,806
Did you get that?

27
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,127
Captain McKenzie, do you understand me?

28
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,447
You are to abort this mission.

29
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,843
If you're in trouble and
you can't speak, just cough.

30
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,362
What the hell are you
doing here, soldier?

31
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,043
Where's the rest of your unit?

32
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,768
Listen, these ragheads would
love to slit your throat.

33
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,247
Now, I need to know how
many of you there are

34
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,728
and what you're doing here, so
I can try to save your necks.

35
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,563
You just don't get it, do you?

36
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,364
Let me spell it out to you.

37
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,244
I work for CIA.

38
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,611
I cannot allow one lost soldier

39
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,371
to compromise my entire operation.

40
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,371
Okay, your choice.

41
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,284
You know what I think, soldier?

42
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,609
I think you are dressed like a woman,

43
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,441
because secretly you
don't want to be a man.

44
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,009
Captain McKenzie, your orders are
to stand down. You are not to...

45
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,008
Now, when I'm done cutting you,

46
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,208
these boys will finish
making a woman of you.

47
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,803
Boy, am I glad to see you.

48
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,922
Craig!

49
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,211
You all right?

50
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,606
Oh, man!

51
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,449
My wife is gonna be relieved.

52
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,483
But control is gonna
cut your balls off, man.

53
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,523
That guy was CIA.

54
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,121
It seems to me, you party with the
devil, God ain't ever gonna help you.

55
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,924
Come on, let's go.

56
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,524
I'm all in.

57
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,083
Come on, let's see what you've got.

58
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,010
How about you give me a loan

59
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,770
and hold on to my bike as collateral?

60
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,445
When are you going to learn, soldier?

61
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,449
You're out of luck, not cash.

62
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
I've never seen anyone
unluckier than you.

63
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,802
So, how did you get out
of the army alive, anyway?

64
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,164
You know what they say, "Lucky in war,

65
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,726
unlucky in life."

66
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,563
So how about the loan?

67
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,527
There you go, soldier. A
nation's grateful thanks.

68
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,367
Until the end of the month.

69
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,051
Deal.

70
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,683
All right, hands on
the table. Nobody move!

71
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,410
Cool it, kid. What's the problem?

72
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,931
The problem?

73
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,249
Two aces of spades?
- It's just a silly mistake.

74
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,044
You stacked the deck, Tony?

75
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,242
I let you win every once in a while.

76
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,764
Didn't you hear what my friend said?

77
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,006
Put your hands on the table.

78
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,805
Trust me, this is not the
way you want to resolve this.

79
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,051
Shut up, all right? You think you can
cheat us like your loser buddy over here?

80
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,964
We're taking the money.

81
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,251
Look, kid, just take the money
and get the hell out of here.

82
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,850
Lucida, give them your purse.

83
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,162
All right, put the money in the bag.

84
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,321
Jeez!

85
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,370
All right, you're next, cowboy.

86
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,767
Your turn. Put the money in the bag.

87
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,848
Put the money in the bag!

88
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,963
All of it.

89
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,730
All of it.

90
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,481
You can put the gun down now.
It's only loaded with blanks.

91
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,204
Really? Let's check!

92
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,368
You really want me to pull this trigger?

93
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,681
Let her go, McKenzie.

94
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,162
Hey! What the hell is going on?

95
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,729
What the hell is going on?

96
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,922
They hired stunt guys.

97
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,889
They want to do business with you.

98
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,723
Just wanted to see if you
still had it in you, soldier.

99
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,609
Captain McKenzie, we
need a man like you.

100
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,969
Well, I don't need you
All I want is my loan.

101
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,529
Thanks for the show.

102
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,931
Crazy.

103
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,809
We ' Il do it your way, Sister.

104
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,451
Trust me, little brother.

105
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,205
Cheers.

106
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,602
So, what do you think they wanted?

107
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,361
There's only one thing I'm good at.

108
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,891
You know, Craig. I'm so broke, man.

109
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,010
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make some money.

110
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,251
Anything. Anything.

111
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,128
The banks, fucking banks, they
already took everything, you know?

112
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,923
There's no work here, man.
There's nothing for a man

113
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,169
the dishonor of the
Army has been released.

114
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,441
We both fought for our country,
Mike, we got nothing for it.

115
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,760
Well, maybe now we need to
start fighting for some money.

116
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,248
Some of the guys from the old
unit are pulling in loads of cash

117
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,647
as mercs in Mexico.

118
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,205
And then...

119
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,450
Hey, baby. What are you doing up?

120
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,201
It's not me who can't sleep, Daddy.

121
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,364
It's Winston.

122
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,408
Come on, darling. Let's
get Winston back to bed.

123
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,722
Look at that, look at
what your nuts made.

124
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,606
I saved those nuts.
- Good night, Daddy. Good night, Craig.

125
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,646
Good night, guys.
- Good night.

126
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,042
You love Joanna and Elize?

127
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,691
Of course.

128
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,003
Then forget about fighting.

129
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
We'll find some other
way to make some money.

130
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,883
I've got about two more weeks before
the banks change the locks on my doors.

131
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,010
Soldiers of Fortune.

132
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,805
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

133
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,925
If you've received this link,

134
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,804
then your net worth pre-qualifies you

135
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,526
for the Soldiers of
Fortune Adventure Program,

136
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,120
the ultimate in extreme vacationing.

137
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,086
On your adventure mission you'll
experience the adrenalin rush of combat

138
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,890
in an actual war zone,

139
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,321
but without the risk
of losing your life.

140
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,284
After all, you've worked
too hard for your millions

141
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,641
not to enjoy them until a ripe old age.

142
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,167
Whether you're sniping
enemy mercenaries,

143
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,362
clandestinely delivering
a cache of weapons,

144
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,164
or blowing up a compound,

145
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,645
you'll be protected
every step of the way

146
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,650
by our qualified action teams.

147
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,520
Every member on our staff
is a highly decorated

148
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,648
special operations veteran.

149
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,444
You prove your manhood,

150
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,841
they ensure your complete safety.

151
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,646
All the proceeds support the freedom
fighters of a small island nation.

152
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,285
And, unlike other charities,

153
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,569
you'll be able to personally oversee
how your contribution is delivered.

154
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,526
While your peers boast about
that luxury cruise in the Caymans,

155
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,008
you fought for liberty
and freedom in a war zone.

156
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,889
We offer the ultimate
in bragging rights.

157
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,566
And the best part is,
it's all tax deductable.

158
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,721
Would you knock it off?
I'm trying to sleep.

159
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,285
Good morning.

160
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,364
Have you had breakfast yet?

161
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,962
You know, I'm warning you,
you're wasting your time.

162
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,930
Sit down, Craig.

163
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,321
How's business. Slow?

164
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,131
Thriving.

165
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,567
NOW!

166
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,368
Whoa! Nice!

167
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,802
So how's your brother's beak?

168
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,561
Who told you Ernesto is my brother?

169
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,606
Thank you.

170
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,843
How did you find me, the Yellow Pages?

171
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,566
I know almost everything about you.

172
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,966
Captain Craig James McKenzie.

173
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,808
Twenty-three special ops and not
one soldier dead under your command.

174
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,045
You were a legend.

175
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,004
And then you were court-martialed
for insubordination

176
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,361
and unbecoming conduct.
- That's old news.

177
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,006
And dishonorably discharged.
- No, no, no.

178
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,044
There's nothing dishonorable about
saving your best friend's testicles.

179
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,046
Your unit was disbanded in disgrace.

180
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,084
I can just imagine how many
people told you thanks for that.

181
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,807
Just one guy, and his
wife. That's plenty for me.

182
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,685
Look, thank you for the breakfast, but,

183
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,928
I got some things I gotta do.

184
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,526
You lost everything because of this man.

185
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,848
Carter Mason.

186
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,291
All right, look, no more games.
Who the hell do you work for?

187
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,767
We're not playing
games. We need your help.

188
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,925
And you need the money. Your
friend, Captain Reed, needs it.

189
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,564
I am through with fighting.

190
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,729
That's good. Because we don't
need you to kill anybody.

191
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,411
We need you to make
sure nobody gets killed.

192
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,210
You want me to protect him?

193
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,369
No, we need you to protect
some people from him.

194
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,810
And this man is Colonel Lupo.

195
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,046
Nice casting.

196
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,682
In Eastern Europe, by the
northern seaboard of the Black Sea,

197
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,327
is Ostriv Zmiinyi, also
known as Snake Island.

198
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,681
Its mountains are rich in
minerals and rare Earth metals.

199
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,207
During the Cold War, there was
an Allied military base there.

200
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,606
Now nobody knows who owns
it, Romania or Ukraine.

201
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,922
So it's no man's land.

202
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,089
Colonel Lupo seized power there four
years ago with a mercenary force.

203
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,771
His head of security is Mason.

204
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,489
Colonel Lupo's regime
is brutal and oppressive.

205
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,768
They kill anyone who dares
to speak up against Lupo.

206
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,971
There is a resistance,

207
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,327
but we don't have the weapons to fight.

208
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,522
Our freedom fighters have been unable

209
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,608
to resist Colonel Lupo's mercenaries.

210
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,167
All, criminals on the
run. The scum of the Earth.

211
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,080
They make life a living hell
for the people of Ostriv Zmiinyi.

212
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,925
So, who's the girl?

213
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,405
That's Magda,

214
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,363
she's Colonel Lupo's daughter,

215
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,211
and the only person he cares for.

216
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,243
She's pure evil.

217
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,247
As long as Lupo finds buyers
for the island's metals

218
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,491
he can finance his mercenaries
and brutalize the people.

219
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,848
All right, so those are the bad guys.

220
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,207
Who are the good guys? You?

221
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,331
I was born on the island.
I want to set it free.

222
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,361
The resistance is dying,
but now there is hope.

223
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,649
Ernesto and I

224
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,048
have found five very rich
men who are willing to help.

225
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,924
You know something, lady?
I've never met a rich guy

226
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,202
who's willing to give
away something for nothing.

227
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,362
What do your backers
want for their money?

228
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,602
Kicks and thrills.

229
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,806
With our Soldiers of
Fortune Adventure Program,

230
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,891
we've set up a basic training
camp for our clients in Romania.

231
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,202
With their charitable contributions,

232
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,450
we've purchased the firepower
to finally resist Colonel Lupo.

233
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,002
Ernesto leased a ship
to transport the weapons.

234
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,122
We know that Lupo's mercenaries

235
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,528
do not patrol the uninhabited
east side of the island.

236
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,761
Our financiers'
adventure mission will be

237
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,167
to escort the weapons to shore

238
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,487
and get them to the resistance base camp

239
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,285
protected by bodyguards at all times.

240
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,568
Wait a second, let me get this straight.

241
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,160
You and Ernesto are
pimping out your revolution

242
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,891
as some kind of tourist attraction
for a bunch of millionaires,

243
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,241
and you expect me to be your guide?

244
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,681
Yes. We need your credentials

245
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,849
to assure our clients of their safety.

246
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,971
One last op, Craig.

247
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,248
You're lucky in war,
you said so yourself.

248
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,886
With you, everybody comes home.

249
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,325
Our clients will never be
near actual combat, Craig.

250
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,131
And you can save your friend's home.

251
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,921
And everybody will be happy.

252
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,201
Our wealthy warriors have arrived.

253
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,249
Tell me what we're dealing with.

254
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,848
The first of our soldiers of fortune

255
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,202
is Charles Herbert Vanderbeer.

256
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,691
Vanderbeer is a genuine
American aristocrat.

257
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,202
One of his ancestors bought
Manhattan from a drunk Indian

258
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,846
for twenty-four silver dollars
and a bottle of moonshine.

259
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,042
Vanderbeer runs a
Wall Street hedge fund.

260
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,162
He made a fortune from sub prime loans,

261
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,521
and then another from the bank bailout.

262
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,965
It's a shame a lot of ordinary
folks lost their homes,

263
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,764
but that's Wall Street for you.

264
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,566
The rich get richer and
the poor can go to hell.

265
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,763
I'm gonna enjoy watching him under fire.

266
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,885
Our second millionaire is Roman
St. John. A metals magnate.

267
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,207
St. John traded vodka and
bluejeans on the black market

268
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,049
before the Berlin Wall fell.

269
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,969
And then, in the anarchy
that followed somehow

270
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,448
all his business rivals got
murdered but he survived.

271
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,410
Now he owns a huge
mining and smelting empire

272
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,966
and lives the life of
an international playboy.

273
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,607
He was last sighted off the
coast of Somalia, fishing.

274
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,883
St. John does have
practical weapons exposure,

275
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,566
but he claims, without any
verifiable military record

276
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,126
that he has experience leading
troops in naval warfare.

277
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,811
He demanded an entourage
of five. He settled for one.

278
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,921
Our next client is Sam Haussmann.

279
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,721
I've heard of this guy.
- Who hasn't?

280
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,962
A cell phone pioneer and a
permanent resident on Forbes List.

281
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,726
Haussmann's lived enough
for three ordinary men.

282
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,883
He's been married five
times, he has eight kids.

283
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,406
He's made two huge
fortunes and lost one.

284
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,568
He's climbed Everest and fought bulls

285
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,603
and hunted every kind of big game.

286
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,961
Even three species that are now extinct.

287
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,651
And he's beaten two major
heart attacks, as well.

288
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,481
And now for the bad. Our fourth client.

289
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,443
The Grim Reaper.

290
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,329
Grimaud Tourneur. Born in French Africa.

291
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,489
Very little is known about this
international man of mystery,

292
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,849
before becoming the world's
most notorious arms dealer.

293
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,291
Our angel of death sold weapons to
both sides in the civil war in Sudan.

294
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,649
Then he started a revolution in Congo

295
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,569
just to peddle more guns.

296
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,407
Grimaud makes even mercenaries
seem like Sisters of Mercy.

297
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,449
He's a profiteer of war,

298
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,040
but he's never participated in one.

299
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,851
He's selling our new friends
their weapons, as well.

300
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,170
And finally, at the bottom of
the barrel, we have Tommy Sin.

301
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,326
Sin is the creator of Death Porn,
the mega-violent fantasy video game.

302
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,562
Five teenagers decapitated their parents

303
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,728
after playing his smash hit game.

304
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,525
But each time Sin is accused
of incitement to murder

305
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,886
he's acquitted.

306
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,685
Sin probably thinks
war is just a game, too.

307
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,406
Apart from his addiction to video games,

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,526
this lunatic just broke his leg.

309
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,803
Welcome to our training camp, gentlemen.

310
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,890
I'm Captain McKenzie,
this is Captain Reed.

311
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,526
These five men are going
to be your bodyguards.

312
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,887
You will obey their every command.

313
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,568
Whose buck is this?

314
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,207
How about they obey our orders?

315
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,087
If any of them is going
to be my bodyguard,

316
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,170
it is they who need
the training, not me.

317
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,128
Yes, sir, Captain, sir.

318
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,248
Three bags full, sir.

319
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,008
The barracks over there are
going to be your accommodations.

320
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,491
Uh, excuse me.

321
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,082
Uh, I trust we all have
our own rooms. I mean...

322
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,328
Over the next few
days you're gonna learn

323
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,522
how to survive in a hot zone.

324
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,085
Just remember,

325
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,124
the only thing worse in action
than a coward is a hero. You got it?

326
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,604
Now, go stow your bags. Dismissed.

327
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,407
Oh, hey, uh, General? Uh, Colonel?

328
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,487
Can, uh, can someone carry my
bag for me, 'cause my leg's done.

329
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,850
I can't I can't carry it.

330
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,370
Got a bum leg!

331
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,884
Jesus!

332
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,642
Jesus Christ. No, I told you
about the fucking pharmacy.

333
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,848
Oh, it's like that, huh?

334
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,802
Helen and I will take the dining room.

335
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,527
What you playing there, son?
- Baby Killer. On the top level.

336
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,642
I'm in the maternity ward.

337
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,643
Hey, Grimaud, can you feel it?

338
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,491
Feel what?

339
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,409
The thrill of being a kid again.

340
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,569
Playing war games with
pop guns in your backyard.

341
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,604
This isn't a kids' game.

342
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,008
We're playing with real weapons now.

343
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,289
The Grim Reaper.

344
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,926
Hmm, big gun.

345
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,008
It's small.

346
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,725
Son, you know

347
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,207
it's not the size of
your gun that matters,

348
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,163
it's where you stick it.

349
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,042
Let me show you a real hunter's weapon.

350
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,286
Now this, here, is Irene.

351
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,930
Irene's a bitch.

352
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,408
She would have sniped that Grim
Reaper of yours at a thousand yards

353
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,761
before you even knew she was there.

354
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,882
Oh, that's nice. May I?
- Yeah, sure.

355
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,240
Oh, thanks!

356
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,330
What're you doing?

357
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,290
Idiot.

358
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,446
You know,

359
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,564
I lost twenty-million dollars

360
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,490
when Lehman Brothers
collapsed on Wall Street.

361
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,206
Sucker

362
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,526
Ch, yeah?

363
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,847
Screw you, too, banker.

364
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,729
Screw you, too, game boy.

365
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,690
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Simmer
down! Simmer down now, boys.

366
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,290
Take it easy, big fella.

367
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,684
How about we have a party

368
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,009
to celebrate you two
losing your cherries.

369
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,125
I agree.

370
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,485
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

371
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,644
Cheers.
- Here's mud in your eye.

372
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,249
1975! Damn, that was a vintage year.

373
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,169
Was she that pretty, Sam?

374
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,763
Yeah, well, whatever she was,
she's probably a grandmother by now.

375
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,885
Here's to good living!

376
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,651
And a quick death.
- Cheers, Sam.

377
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,683
Champagne, sir?

378
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,001
Thank you.

379
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,651
I bet you I kill more
bad guys than you do.

380
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,006
Make it a hundred grand and you're on.

381
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,731
A hundred thousand? Deal.

382
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,130
I bet a million bucks

383
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,049
you both get blue balls.

384
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,289
Neither of you are man
enough to kill a man for real.

385
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,366
It's a draw.

386
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,731
I hate a party when I'm not invited.

387
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,844
Let 'em have their fun.

388
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,088
We're getting paid, aren't we?

389
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,769
You know, those bastards are right.

390
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,360
Their bodyguards do need to train.

391
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,365
You look like an angel. An
angel when you're dancing, angel.

392
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,767
How is your hedge fund?

393
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,291
Fine.

394
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,531
Why do you ask?

395
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,045
Nothing.

396
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,761
L just heard some rumors, that's all.

397
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,449
You know, how when the tide
goes out, the wrecks get exposed?

398
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,045
Nonsense.

399
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,928
Hey!
- Videoboy!

400
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,803
Damn. We're being attacked!

401
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,045
Let's make a run for it.

402
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,969
Gentlemen! Your throats
have all been cut.

403
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,090
Sorry to interrupt your party,

404
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,921
but, after all, you did say that
your bodyguards do need to train.

405
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,407
Thank you, bodyguards.

406
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,761
Now at least we know who
the most vulnerable are.

407
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,645
Vanderbeer and Sin will be
killed on our first contact.

408
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,206
Grim doesn't stand much of a chance.

409
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,042
And, uh, Haussmann and St. John,
I don't see them lasting very long.

410
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,527
Thank you, gentlemen.
If anybody is interested,

411
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,722
training begins
at oh-six-hundred.

412
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,128
That's, like, six in
the morning, isn't it?

413
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,000
Do you think your adrenalin
junkies will show up?

414
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,880
If they don't, let's just go home.

415
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,604
I got a bad feeling
about this op, anyway.

416
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,925
Oh, shit.

417
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,444
What happened to your lady?

418
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,722
I, uh, I sent her away.
It's time for business.

419
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,726
What about you? Huh? What
did you do with your valet?

420
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,208
I, uh, gave him a vacation.

421
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,641
He's been asking for, uh, well, years.

422
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,684
All right, let's get started.

423
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,326
Drop and give me fifty.

424
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,131
Drop!

425
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,921
There you go, boys. Kiss that anthill.

426
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,889
Come on, Grim! Come
on, Grim! Let's move it.

427
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,082
Come on, kick ass! Let's go, Vanderbeer.

428
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Now, Haussmann, get your ass
over that wall. Let's go! Come on!

429
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,363
Move it! Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

430
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,284
Move your ass! Move your ass!

431
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,964
Come on, Haussmann, move your
ass! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

432
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,605
What's that noise?

433
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,967
What are you doing?
What the hell is that?

434
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,491
Is that a phone?

435
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,166
Hey, Alma. What did you do now?

436
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,601
Hang up that phone! Hang up that phone!

437
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,687
Uh, I'll call you back.

438
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,929
You do that again, I'll kill
you myself. Come on! Move it!

439
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,929
You're moving like a senior citizen.

440
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,687
Come on, Vanderbeer. Your
valet's not here to do it for you.

441
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,687
Work with your bodyguards.

442
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,486
Protect the money!

443
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,007
Hello?
- Another cell phone addict?

444
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,640
You're all dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

445
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,206
Pathetic! Pathetic!

446
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,525
Now, gentlemen, the rules are simple.

447
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,768
Protect your ﬂag at all costs,

448
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,161
and capture theirs.

449
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,446
And try to work together as a team.

450
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,530
Shoot at anyone with a green armband.

451
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,483
Vanderbeer, you stay in the
bunker and protect the ﬂag.

452
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,371
St. John, Sin, you ﬂank left.

453
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,761
Me and Haussmann will ﬂank right.

454
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,721
All, right.

455
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,526
Let's see what you wealthy
warriors are made of.

456
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,363
What is wrong with you?
You must obey my orders.

457
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,482
Since when is this your command?
- Since now.

458
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,410
I am the one with the most
military experience here.

459
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,282
Son,

460
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,483
just because you peddle a lot of
guns to a bunch of tin-pot dictators,

461
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,371
that don't make you our leader.
- Don't call me "son," old man.

462
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,767
You're not my father.
- How do you know?

463
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,845
I should be in charge!

464
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,486
My last game, War Whore,
sold fifty-million units.

465
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,364
That's five-zero.
- So what?

466
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,767
My great great uncle was a
general in two World Wars.

467
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,884
I should be in command.
- Oh, wow, your uncle was in a war.

468
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,729
That must mean you're
an incredible warrior.

469
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,684
Look, that makes no sense.

470
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,488
Why don't we take off these helmets
and I'll punch you in the throat?

471
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,690
I'm not obeying a virgin.
- Who are you calling a virgin?

472
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,121
You've never killed a man, have you?

473
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,044
That's what men are made
for. Fighting, not fucking.

474
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,320
Maybe I'll shoot you
just to pop my cherry.

475
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,411
You just try it. And I'll
cut your bourgeois throat.

476
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,124
Come on, try it.

477
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,160
Excuse me, ladies.

478
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,248
Hey, where are you going?

479
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,442
I've got nothing to
prove to you pussies.

480
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,130
I signed up for a fight.

481
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,768
Ah! Not my face!

482
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,086
Now, that's what I
call a hostile takeover.

483
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,807
You know the only rule in
life? You've got to win.

484
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,771
We won!

485
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,525
We're dead, but we won!

486
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,845
Come on, come on! Through the tires

487
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,167
Come on! Come on! Move it!

488
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,810
All right.

489
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,764
Come on! Come on! Come
on! Come on! Keep moving!

490
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,971
No, no. Right in there.

491
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,561
I know you've got a
bum leg. I don't care!

492
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,762
I don't care. You signed
up for this, didn't you?

493
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,287
Get through there. Hop over it.

494
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,289
There you go.

495
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,481
All right. Good.

496
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,485
Come on, Grim! Come
on, Grim! Let's move it!

497
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,650
Let's see why they call
you the killer. Let's go!

498
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,685
Cover the money!

499
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,282
Good. Good.

500
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,642
Game over.

501
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,131
Gentlemen,

502
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,450
tomorrow we leave for Snake
Island. For your own safety,

503
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,729
all of your personal possessions
are now going to be collected.

504
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,366
Place them in this bag.

505
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,885
Anything you can think of

506
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,571
hat can be used to
positively identify you.

507
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,242
Cell phones, documents, wallets.
You're not taking anything with you.

508
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,406
Until our mission is complete
you will have no names.

509
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,482
Come on, move it, Vanderbeer.
Put your cell phone in there.

510
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,330
Now get some shut eye. We
leave at oh-five-hundred.

511
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,284
How long until we take off, Captain?

512
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,051
As soon as we're done
loading the weapons.

513
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,483
All right, guys, let's
keep loading up boxes.

514
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,762
Hurry up! Move it! Move it!

515
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,968
Aw! Come on, kid.

516
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,570
Five minutes to landing.
- Roger that.

517
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,010
We've got a problem, buddy.

518
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,764
I hear you. Where's it coming from?

519
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,121
Okay, take her out. Fire!

520
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,485
Beautiful.

521
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,926
Craig, it's getting hot!

522
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,485
What the hell is going on, Captain?

523
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,729
She said this shoreline
was safe. Lying bitch!

524
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,287
Give them a scare. Fire!

525
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,249
Look who we have here.

526
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,441
Again!

527
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,081
Spin the wheel!

528
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,328
I know how we can beat the system.

529
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,771
What are you talking about?

530
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,486
The shells take five seconds to arrive.

531
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,960
The fire-control computer projects
target movement five seconds ahead.

532
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,409
If you zigzag fast enough
you can beat the computer.

533
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,768
All right, Mike. Zigzag.

534
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,087
Zigzag. Head for the coast.

535
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,690
Head for the coast!

536
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,048
Port-side boat. Fire!

537
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,681
Mike!

538
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,645
Mike!

539
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,248
Get down. Get down!

540
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,204
Okay, grab whatever gear you can
and take cover in those rocks.

541
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,286
Come on! Come on!

542
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,249
Welcome to Snake Island, gentlemen.

543
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,402
You may never leave.

544
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,684
Come on, come on! Move
it! Move it! Move it!

545
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,880
Fire.

546
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,366
God damn!

547
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,687
That'll pucker your rear end.

548
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,889
Any injuries?
- No.

549
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,211
This is Tommy Sin.

550
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,487
Didn't I say no cell phones?

551
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,645
And you, how much are you getting?

552
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,728
What are they paying
you? My friends are dead!

553
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,081
Grimaud Tourneur does
not sell people out.

554
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,645
Well, then how did you
know about that cannon?

555
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,207
I sold it to Colonel
Lupo. He didn't pay me.

556
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,482
That's why I'm on this trip.

557
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,206
To kill him or get paid.

558
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,126
The Grim Reaper always gets paid.

559
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,760
Come on. Come on! Move it! Move it!

560
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,325
Cover! Cover!

561
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,525
You! You said the sea
route would be safe.

562
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,450
Because of you, my men are dead.

563
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,249
I knew you were bad news.

564
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,166
Before I met you, I never
lost a man under my command.

565
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,329
What am I supposed to do
with your precious sponsors?

566
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,722
Fulfill your contract.

567
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,649
Lead them to safety.

568
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,805
These men need your skills now, Craig.

569
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,044
Their survival is in your hands.

570
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,281
Once we get to the resistance base camp,

571
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,768
Ernesto can arrange
for their evacuation.

572
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,960
Come on.

573
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,524
Let's get the fuck off this island.

574
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,284
Grimaud, give me your cell phone.

575
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,402
But you wanted to kill man-prey.

576
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,568
You haven't completed your mission.

577
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,808
Yeah, that's very clever.
Give me your cell phone.

578
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,486
I don't have one.

579
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,648
Hey, Sam. Do you have a cell phone?

580
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,047
Now, son, I know things
aren't going according to plan,

581
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,770
but Sam Haussmann didn't come all
this way just to turn tail and run.

582
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,882
And I'm not sure using a cell phone

583
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,162
is such a swift idea, either.

584
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,808
This isn't what we paid for!

585
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,125
How you holding up, Sam?

586
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,925
Getting old, Captain. Slowing down.

587
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,088
Enjoy it while you can, Captain.

588
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,607
You're a long time gone.

589
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,327
I'm hungry. What have we got to eat?

590
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,965
We eat at the camp.

591
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,650
Just remember, I'm on
a low-carb diet, okay?

592
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,165
It's over.

593
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,005
Without those weapons, we
can't resist any longer.

594
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,521
Tomorrow, you'll evacuate our sponsors.

595
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,566
I'll find us a boat. You'll be
paid in full for your services.

596
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,086
Definitely not low-carb.

597
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,488
I should have brought my chef.

598
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,168
Charlie, why the hell did you
pay to come on this mission?

599
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,601
Just so's you could
whine about everything?

600
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,683
Bragging rights.

601
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,125
Such is life on the street. Wall Street.

602
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,764
He who dares, wins.

603
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,287
We already know why Grimaud's here.

604
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,651
He's being shot at
with his own merchandise

605
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,122
and he hasn't been paid for it.

606
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,163
Why are you here, Tommy?

607
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,411
Doctor's orders.

608
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,283
My psychiatrist said that I am
addicted to shooter video games.

609
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,685
She suggested a dose of healthy reality.

610
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,085
So you're here to feel the real?

611
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,491
All right, that takes
care of the logistics.

612
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,006
But I'm not leaving this island
until we figure out one thing.

613
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,568
Why my men were killed.

614
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,730
Somebody talked.

615
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,961
If I were you, I would
move this base right now.

616
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,930
How about you, Sam?

617
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,287
Well, Sam just wants to hang a
human head in his trophy cabinet.

618
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,447
I don't plan on going home.

619
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,087
My present wife, I just
call her "number five,"

620
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,884
she's suing me for divorce.

621
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,642
And according to that prenuptial bullshit
I was an fool in love enough to sign,

622
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,804
if we split, she gets
half of everything I own.

623
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,289
Whereas, if I get killed, my
kids inherit the whole she-bang.

624
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,609
Hell, I've already
survived two heart attacks.

625
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,849
I've done pretty much everything
there is to do on this old planet.

626
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,167
And I've enjoyed the
hell out of it, too.

627
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,443
No, this here is all there is.

628
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,809
I say we stay here for the
night, break camp in the morning.

629
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,203
Okay, fine, that's your choice.
But I'm taking my men out of here.

630
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,848
At least what's left of them.

631
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,250
Die in battle...

632
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,450
That's a hell of a way
to screw a gold-digger.

633
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,364
And what are your reasons?

634
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,926
Get your things, we're
getting the hell out of here.

635
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,409
Yes!

636
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,602
Oh, we got 'em, we got 'em.

637
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,406
Here, take a look.

638
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,527
Ernesto!
- Cecilia, save yourself!

639
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,328
Okay, left ﬂank, move in. Wipe 'em out.

640
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,924
What's up, Captain?

641
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,365
You wanted to see what war
looks like? Take a look.

642
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,922
All right, wait here. Don't
give way your position.

643
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,530
Hey, where you going?

644
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,363
Get the bitch!

645
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,842
Jesus, they're getting
torn to shreds down there.

646
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,284
So this is what our money bought us?

647
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,280
To play war safely, from a distance?

648
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,207
So, we're going to just hide?

649
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,525
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

650
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,762
Let's go kill some bad guys.

651
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,242
We start firing, they'll
spot our position.

652
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,921
Shoot, you can't bake a cake
without breaking some eggs.

653
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,441
Jackpot!

654
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,530
There's a sniper! There! There!
The enemy sniper, you see him?

655
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,201
The Grim Reaper is next.

656
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,322
Come on. Come on.

657
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,725
Incoming!

658
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,282
What the fuck happened?

659
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,482
Which one of you is responsible
for giving away our position?

660
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,729
Seemed to me our friends
down there needed some help.

661
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,000
Where's Vanderbeer?

662
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,282
Last time I saw him he was in the...

663
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,609
Looks like I won that bet.

664
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,961
It's a bet, you'll never call in.

665
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,091
Shit! Come on, come on!
Move it! Move it! Follow me.

666
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,801
Come!

667
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,887
Everybody behind the tree. Take cover!

668
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,921
Can they see us?
- Sin, stay down!

669
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,448
Where is that chopper coming from?

670
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,167
I said, where is that
chopper coming from?

671
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,403
Cecilia, you've got to snap out of it!

672
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,603
That helicopter's coming from
a helipad that serves the mines.

673
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,723
It's about three kilometers from here.

674
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,447
How do you know about this base?

675
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,966
I used to play in these
woods when I was a boy.

676
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,406
My father served here
during the Cold War.

677
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,202
And what do they mine here? Gold?

678
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,085
Coltan.

679
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,201
It's a rare Earth metal.

680
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,370
And you trade metals, don't you?
- Yes.

681
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,885
You want to tell us
now why you are here?

682
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,280
Business with Colonel Lupo.

683
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,801
I need that metal.
- Business?

684
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,484
You bastard.

685
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,449
People died because of your business.

686
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,086
We all believed you wanted
to help free this island.

687
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,000
Maybe it's you. You who
betrayed us for fucking money.

688
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,923
Your greed has left you
with blood on your hands.

689
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,810
Here.

690
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,084
Wait here until I get back.

691
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,405
Cecilia!

692
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,768
It's too exposed up here.

693
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,842
We've got to get back to the group.

694
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,008
Look, I'm sorry about your brother.

695
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,769
And I'm sorry about your friends.

696
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,009
But there is nothing I
can do to bring them back.

697
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,240
Just like there's nothing
I can do to bring back mine.

698
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,042
Boys, this is our chance.

699
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,365
Sam, do you think you
can pilot that thing?

700
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,690
Piece of cake.

701
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,844
Let's wait for Craig.

702
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,601
It's a trap. I can smell it.

703
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,604
We capture it. We wait for them there.

704
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,802
You really want to die on this island?

705
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,044
Any moment now, that
chopper could take off again.

706
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,644
What do you say, gentlemen?

707
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,968
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

708
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,486
I'm in.

709
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,728
Let's do it.
- Come on.

710
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,325
Let's go.

711
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,405
Craig.

712
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,965
See how easy it is to
trap fools like you?

713
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,528
All you need is the right bait.

714
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,970
Take them away!

715
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,002
Those stupid bags of money.

716
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,124
Oh, Jesus Christ

717
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,171
What is this place?

718
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,601
It was a NATO base during the Cold War.

719
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,882
The whole mountain is
tunneled out from the inside.

720
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,161
Nice tomb.

721
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,561
Think we'll ever get out of here alive?

722
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,284
Hello again!

723
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,320
Your accommodation awaits.

724
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,130
Nice here, huh?

725
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,080
Private pool.

726
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,444
Room service.

727
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,404
Concierge.

728
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,087
Touch me again and I'll kill you.

729
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,289
Thank God, you're here!

730
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,201
Charlie!

731
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,045
Hey, Tommy-

732
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,285
I don't believe it.

733
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,124
Hey, Sam. Hey, buddy.

734
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,811
Well, we thought you were dead.

735
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,486
Me? Dead?

736
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,445
Of course not.

737
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,401
So what happened to you?

738
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,284
Well, I don't know about you guys,

739
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,006
but I have never been so
scared in my whole life.

740
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,408
I go outside to take a piss

741
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,607
and then all the shells started dropping
and the sound and the noise and the smoke.

742
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,643
I got completely disoriented.

743
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,843
I did not know where the fuck I was.

744
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,603
So I eventually found my way back and
the tent was destroyed you guys had gone,

745
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,609
and soldiers came and...

746
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,683
Now here I am.

747
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,447
Does anyone have a cell phone?
- No.

748
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,005
Just hoping.

749
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:38,444
Hey, Charlie. Have you got any of
those fancy cigars of yours left?

750
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,490
Sure, Sam.

751
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,922
Hey, Tommy, what happened
to our Captain and that girl?

752
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,164
Oh, he is...
- They are dead.

753
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,608
Yeah. Dead.

754
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,280
Yeah.

755
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,731
Do you mind if I have one of those?

756
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,921
Of course not.
- Thanks.

757
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,122
Only fifty bucks a smoke.

758
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,447
So, uh, how did they get killed?

759
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,641
Tank shell.

760
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,923
Kapow! Boom! Awful.

761
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,723
I think I've still got some of
the Captain in my hair, Charlie.

762
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,167
Well, some trip this
turned out to be, huh?

763
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,130
What are you looking at?

764
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,611
Open Up!

765
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,080
Open Up!

766
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,487
You fucking piece of piss.

767
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,604
You sold us out!

768
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,121
Yeah, well. Big deal.

769
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,091
Get over it.

770
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,690
I'm going to kick your ass.

771
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,442
Eat shit and die, old man.

772
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,881
Fucking hell. Okay.

773
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,847
You can inform Colonel Lupe

774
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,368
that Captain McKenzie
and the girl are dead.

775
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,365
Satisfied?

776
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,968
Ooh, the wild bunch.

777
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,689
So, you see, gentlemen,

778
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,327
we do know who you really are.

779
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,765
Mr. Sin.

780
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,570
I always wanted to be a nemesis
character in one of your video games.

781
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,683
Why would anyone want to play
a tin-pot criminal like you

782
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,246
in one of my video games?

783
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,684
Because he can get to do shit like this.

784
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,444
That's why!

785
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,770
He shot me in the leg!

786
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,966
We can stay dry under here.

787
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,005
Think there are any snakes in here?

788
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,248
No. Just me.

789
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,446
I'm sorry for this
challenging assignment.

790
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,766
I'm all in.

791
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,121
Now we get to save the others.
- What do you mean?

792
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,766
Well, what did you think I was
gonna do, leave them all here to die?

793
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,841
Come on, Sam!
- Yeah.

794
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,246
Breathe hard, Sam.

795
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,566
Breathe hard. That's it.

796
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,963
Well, you wanted to
feel the real game, boy.

797
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,923
Now you know.

798
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,804
It hurts.

799
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,011
How does it look? Am I going to die?

800
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,243
Yes.
- What?

801
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,849
Someday. But not from
this little scratch.

802
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,921
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right.
- Hold him down.

803
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,844
I'm okay. I'm okay, I'm all right.

804
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,611
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

805
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,728
1899. I saved the best for last.

806
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,486
It's a goddamn shame

807
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,331
to waste good cognac on a ﬂesh wound.

808
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,923
Here you go, son.

809
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,247
Have a little hair of the goat.

810
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,481
Is it finished?
- Yes, yes.

811
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,170
Is it over?
- Yeah.

812
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,766
You should put that around your neck.

813
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,361
Go!

814
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,364
Good morning, gentlemen.

815
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,482
We're looking well this morning.

816
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,331
Come on, come on, line 'em
up. We've got business.

817
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,764
Good morning, gentlemen.

818
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,288
I trust you've got no illusions
as to why you're still alive.

819
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,642
Half of your net worth.

820
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,521
That's my price for
letting each of you go.

821
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,484
Once we agree,

822
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,561
my new financial consultant
will work out the details.

823
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,528
And if we don't agree?

824
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,362
Then where you are going,

825
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,529
you don't get to take anything with you.

826
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,884
The Grim Reaper always
gets paid. You owe me.

827
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,402
And what about you, old man?

828
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,010
Old enough to know
bullshit when I step in it.

829
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,162
Would you rather lose
your lives than your money?

830
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,729
Are you rich bastards
really that tight-fisted?

831
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,522
That's your choice.

832
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,444
Kill this liar first.

833
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,404
And what about me?

834
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,761
I might want to buy an extra life.

835
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,041
Tommy!

836
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,482
We're not in a fucking video
game. This man will kill us.

837
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:55,811
Mr. Vanderbeer, how much do
you calculate Mr. Sin is worth?

838
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,640
My daughter.

839
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,721
Next time, I'll kill you.

840
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,684
Hey, Lupo!

841
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,247
Hold your fire!

842
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,001
If you want your daughter
back, you'll let these men go.

843
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,370
Release the prisoners!

844
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,881
Go!

845
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,121
Don't shoot!

846
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,410
Secure the base!

847
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,682
I want those bastards killed!

848
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,921
Come on!

849
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,487
Come here, my darling.
- You heard him. Go!

850
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,051
Craig!

851
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,124
Cecilia! You go!
We'll find another way.

852
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,568
Get the hell out of here!

853
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,610
That bitch tried to kill me!
- Magda, stop!

854
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,609
Don't worry. She'll be fine.
- After her!

855
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,881
Follow me!

856
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,044
All right, come on. We are
going this way. Go! Go!

857
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,763
Hey! Where did they
go? Where did they go?

858
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,849
On the right, guys!
On the right! Come on!

859
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,122
Take this boat back to Colonel Lupo.

860
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,566
There is no one here. Raise the boom!

861
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,880
You lose.

862
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,684
Hey, Captain.

863
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,123
This is my merchandise.

864
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,410
Help yourselves.

865
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,006
Shit! We've got to get
the hell out of here!

866
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,771
If a bullet hits one of those
barrels, we're all dead.

867
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,051
Give me a push.

868
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,001
What are you gonna do?

869
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,691
No worries, I'm only
going along for the ride.

870
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,365
Push, god damn it!

871
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,286
Push! Come on!

872
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,290
Stay down! Stay down!

873
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,161
You find those guys or I
get the fuck off this island.

874
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,966
There they are!

875
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,325
Cover me!

876
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,968
Take him out with grenades. Okay?
- No!

877
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,088
What do you mean, "no"?
- There are barrels of explosives.

878
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,601
If they ignite, this
whole place will blow up.

879
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,963
Okay, look. You take care of that old
man. I'll see you're well paid for it.

880
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,570
I'll be back.

881
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,730
Where is everyone going?

882
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,961
Shoot!

883
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,281
Shoot him!

884
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,644
Remember me?

885
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,682
I told you I'd kill you.

886
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,044
Hey, Tommy-

887
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,689
Looking for somebody?

888
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,169
Before you kill me, Charlie,

889
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,609
just answer me one thing.
- Yeah.

890
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,883
Why did you do it?

891
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,369
Nothing personal, Tommy.

892
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,684
I had no choice.

893
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,646
You see, I knew my hedge
fund was going to crash.

894
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,403
I didn't want to spend the
rest of my life in jail,

895
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,285
so I transferred the
rest of my funds here.

896
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,163
I thought this would make
quite a nice a retirement home.

897
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,931
My mistake.

898
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,209
My fucking leg!

899
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,766
Stop messing around, you little junkie.

900
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,160
Charlie! Don't do it.

901
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,129
Video boy! Do it!

902
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,769
Fucking banker!

903
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,846
I hope you guys are long gone.

904
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,211
Bye, bye, number five.

905
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,047
Nice! Nice work, frog's legs.

906
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,489
The Grim Reaper always gets paid.

907
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,563
Breathe! Come on.

908
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,766
Nice work.

909
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,249
A toast. To Sam Haussmann!
