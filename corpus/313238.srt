<i>Chinese mob ? That's my money, mine</i>

3
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:09,677
<i>They will come looking for us and
then, they will go after our families.</i>

4
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:10,973
<i>There's somebody out back.</i>

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,918
<i>Izzy !</i>

6
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:15,289
<i>Put him in the car, get him out
of here ! You know what to do.</i>

7
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:19,190
<i>Your wife's condition took a turn</i>

8
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:20,749
<i>She had a laceration
of the muscle heart.</i>

9
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:21,931
<i>What's the good news ?</i>

10
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:23,806
<i>Thirty to forty million dollars</i>

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,327
<i>We're going to do it on
the plane, in the air.</i>

12
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,196
<i>I got assignments.</i>

13
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:27,765
<i>Elmo, grab your lunch
pail, you're taking the job.</i>

14
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,184
<i>And your guy in new york ?</i>

15
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,603
<i>In due time, my friend.</i>

16
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:31,653
<i>I'm married.</i>

17
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:32,934
<i>Of course you are.</i>

18
00:00:32,977 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>I can't get Izzy out of my head.</i>

19
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:36,195
<i>It's for a friend.</i>

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,597
<i>We need to know if She saw us, dawg.</i>

21
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:39,924
<i>She's going to live with her
father in Hawaii after the funeral.</i>

22
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:41,125
<i>He never even left.</i>

23
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:43,982
<i>What's wrong with this guy ? At
least he doesn't shoot people.</i>

24
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:46,350
<i>You steal, you pay.</i>

25
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,702
<i>I gave the money back. Give me the names</i>

26
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:25,232
Oh.

27
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:21,294
Bad dreams.

28
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,838
You nervous about going back to school ?

29
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:29,039
I heard noises, breaking glass.

30
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:30,797
Couldn't sleep.

31
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:32,727
I, um, I was looking for an ambien.

32
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,453
Sorry about that.

33
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,247
Yeah.

34
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:44,655
So Tam, you know, what
happened the other night ?

35
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,882
You know, that guy was
crazy. He was on drugs.

36
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,126
He was waving around a gun.

37
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:52,173
It was self defense.

38
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:56,948
And it's not that serious even.
They took him to the hospital,

39
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,236
he's already back in Texas.

40
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,029
It's water under the bridge.

41
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,069
But it would be better

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,775
if it stayed between us.

43
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,620
Ok.

44
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,693
Better for who ?

45
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:33,718
The Bloc Team Presents To You Thief, Episode
3 "Everything That Rises Must Converge"

46
00:04:58,656 --> 00:04:59,493
Huddle up.

47
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:01,277
No GPS. She's all clean.

48
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,165
Whoo!

49
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,164
Ah, sweet.

50
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,420
Man, I haven't fired one
of these since the gulf.

51
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,384
- The gulf of Mexico ?

52
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,691
- See ?

53
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,538
That's what a spic would think first.

54
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,779
The Persian gulf, bitch.

55
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:25,027
You think we're going to need these ?

56
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:29,179
Well, if you don't want one,
I'll find someone who does.

57
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,836
Any slant-eyed bastard
tries to take me down,

58
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,810
it's about to be
Guadalcanal all over again.

59
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,015
We fought the japs there,
mo, not the Chinese.

60
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:37,242
- Get it straight.
- Yeah, whatever.

61
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:38,859
They all look the same.

62
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,754
How we know it's the
chinks that done it anyway ?

63
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,219
They're coming for us, Jack.

64
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,547
I saw what they did to her.

65
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:50,610
I'll take the P99.

66
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,368
Move one inch and I'll kill you.

67
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:26,778
Who are you ?

68
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,266
Hey !

69
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,699
Billy Kwan.

70
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,263
Shrimp boy?

71
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,270
Is that supposed to
mean something to me ?

72
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:38,776
Uncle Lao sent me.

73
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:40,902
How do I know that ?

74
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,848
Slowly.

75
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,511
That's him with my mom.

76
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:53,022
He's your brother ?

77
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:57,976
Your his nephew ?

78
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,646
Yeah, his real nephew.

79
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,279
Not some paper son.

80
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:15,902
Hello uncle, it's Vincent.

81
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:18,486
He said he was your nephew.

82
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,228
It's just that,

83
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,190
that I'm used to working alone.

84
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:29,620
Of course, but

85
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,677
No, uncle, no problem.

86
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,748
<i>Basic principles of Macroeconomics.</i>

87
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,685
You actually read this shit?

88
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:41,565
Here's the deal, bro.

89
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:44,518
You do exactly what I tell you to
do. No more, no less you understand ?

90
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:47,741
Whatever.

91
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:50,860
So, dude?

92
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,086
Who we gonna kill ?

93
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:56,805
The plane has a lower
deck with a galley.

94
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,316
The food is stored here

95
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,685
and the forward cargo
hold is right next to it.

96
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,372
Are we going to need oxygen ?

97
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:04,324
No, it's pressurized,
temperature controlled.

98
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,789
How we going to get the carts on the
plane ? We got an inside guy in New York ?

99
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:07,790
Yeah, we have one.

100
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:08,808
This guy phoos.

101
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:09,869
You met him ?

102
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:10,988
Not yet.

103
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:13,069
How  are we doing on communications ?

104
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,469
Thoriah satellite phones,

105
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:15,525
single hop link,

106
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,819
perfect for air to ground,

107
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,005
u ndetectable.

108
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,565
But we're going to need four grand.

109
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,998
Jack, come and take a ride with me.

110
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,445
Nah, in no way, ain't doing it.

111
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,986
That's bullshit, you are doing it.

112
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:32,095
Nick, you said she was
going to be in Hawaii by now.

113
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,156
Well, her father's a prick, ok ?

114
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,284
Look, no disrespect, man,
but that's her problem.

115
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,852
No, Jack, it's our problem.

116
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:38,956
Chinese are still out
there, they get Tammy first,

117
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,421
that's bad for us.

118
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,796
So you want me to babysit her ?

119
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:43,499
No, get gabo on bitch patrol.

120
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:45,756
Oh, I get it now,

121
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:48,892
obviously you've forgotten how
many times I bailed your ass out.

122
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:50,396
What, how many ?

123
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,461
Charleston, ok?

124
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:52,368
Ok, one.

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,239
Jacksonville.

126
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:53,939
All right.

127
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:56,363
And the bookie who wanted to do the
Picasso on your face with the lipstick.

128
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,548
- Ok. All right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,699
Jesus.

130
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:17,676
Look what the cat drug in.

131
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:18,971
Billy Ray ?

132
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:19,872
Yep.

133
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:21,005
How's the family ?

134
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:21,989
About the same.

135
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,507
My old lady's drunk, my son's in Iraq.

136
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:26,812
What can I do you for ?

137
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,002
I need something fast.

138
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,977
You want me to build
you a jumbo jet, huh ?

139
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,269
No, just part of the cargo hold.

140
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,721
Three thousand if you
can do it in 72 hours.

141
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:42,954
Five.

142
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:44,067
Kiss me.

143
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:45,516
What ?

144
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,137
<i>You  saw Dog day afternoon.</i>

145
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:48,806
Yeah, what about it ?

146
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:50,035
If i'm going to take it in the ass,

147
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:51,210
I'd liked to be kissed first.

148
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,499
That's funny.

149
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:53,843
Five.

150
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:03,204
Counselor ?

151
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:07,001
I do your ass a favor and you
tie me to a double homicide ?

152
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,098
I didn't know what
they were going to do !

153
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:09,797
Yeah ?

154
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,084
I was just doing a friend a favor.

155
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,787
Who's your friend ? Huh ?

156
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:14,834
Who ?

157
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,171
You don't want to do this,

158
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,521
you're signing your own death warrant.

159
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,010
Because of you, I'm already dead.

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,904
Now, who ?

161
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,235
Ok, fine.

162
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:26,875
All right.

163
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,753
One less hand job
you're gonna be giving.

164
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,034
Ah !

165
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,744
I'm waiting.

166
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,042
- Fine.
- Who???

167
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,265
I'm waiting !

168
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:39,201
Ok.

169
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:46,480
Now who ?

170
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,354
The Chinese outfit out of San Francisco.

171
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,120
The crew hit their bank and the
Chinese want their money back.

172
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:56,472
What the hell is that guy doing
killing civilians in my town ?

173
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,729
They weren't civilians.

174
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,169
The woman was dirty, she was the fence.

175
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:01,481
What about the crew ?

176
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,674
They down here, too ?

177
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:03,905
That's all I know.

178
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,633
What was the score ? How much ?

179
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,554
Newspaper said two million.

180
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:12,441
No shit. Two mill.

181
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:17,089
I'd put some ice on
that hand if I were you.

182
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,842
Forty grand ?

183
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,743
What kind of shit you
smoking up there, Jess ?

184
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,064
You know the drill,

185
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:30,505
it's license, credit cards,
social security numbers.

186
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,290
Right, a set for me, too.

187
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:39,153
Oh come on, man, we've done
a lot of business together.

188
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:43,002
I don't give a shit about 9-11.

189
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:43,944
I'm not paying 40k.

190
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,657
You ok, man?

191
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:52,872
Well, what's it look like ?

192
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:54,416
Honestly ?

193
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,080
Not so good.

194
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:57,696
I haven't been sleeping.

195
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,151
If I were you, I wouldn't even try.

196
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:00,864
You have lots of ghosts to carry around.

197
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,107
I don't believe in ghosts.

198
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:05,780
I believe in what I can touch, what I can
put my hands around, like 40 million bucks.

199
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,431
And to get that,

200
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:09,081
we need to get into Roz's house.

201
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,934
Well, I don't know about that, man.
That place is crawling with cops.

202
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:14,208
She was killed before she gave me
the name of the guy in New York.

203
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:15,673
She keeps it in a little book.

204
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,096
Well, we've got 12 days to the score and we
don't have the guy who puts us on the plane ?

205
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,312
This is our best play.

206
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,814
It's a crime scene, bro.

207
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:23,246
There's always a way in.

208
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,888
We get what we need,

209
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:26,663
I'll sleep like a baby !

210
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:45,445
Hey, girl.

211
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,782
Hmmmm.

212
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,654
I've been looking all over for you.

213
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,991
Hmmmm.

214
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:53,510
You want to get something to eat ?

215
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,846
- No, I don't want to go
back in there. - Huh-uh.

216
00:12:58,401 --> 00:12:59,488
It's just like

217
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:03,013
everybody's treating me
like I'm a freak, you know ?

218
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,688
Like, oh look, there's
the girl whose mom died.

219
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,903
I just can't wait to
get out of this school.

220
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,278
They're just a bunch
of ignorant crackers !

221
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,822
Here.

222
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:13,596
Have some of this.

223
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,119
It will make you feel so much better.

224
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:17,717
What is it ?

225
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,245
Bootleg Little John.

226
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:20,511
Ooh.

227
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:22,797
Hey, do you want to go to
Jessica's party on Friday ?

228
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:24,876
I hear her parent are in Las Vegas.

229
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:28,133
I don't, think so.

230
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:31,141
You know, it's my stepfather.

231
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,381
He's kind of paranoid.

232
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,150
It's only been a week since, you know

233
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,062
Yeah.

234
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:37,269
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,821
But you can't stay sad forever.

236
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,021
Let's cut.

237
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:48,924
You sure ?

238
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:51,102
I just can't be here
right now, you know.

239
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:52,925
Ok.

240
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:53,469
Let's go.

241
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:54,423
Ok.

242
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,963
Still hooked on giant steps ?

243
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,620
The old tunes are the best tunes.

244
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,034
Of course, you never properly
credit Jimmy Garrison.

245
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,083
He's  the engine.

246
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,364
Listen to those bass figures !

247
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:32,804
It's not about the engine, man,

248
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:34,293
it's about trane.

249
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:36,932
None of those cats
were ever as good again.

250
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:38,108
McCoy Tyner ?

251
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,173
Elvin Jones ?

252
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,453
Shit, you really are
getting old, old man.

253
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,421
Old enough to know a
fool when I see one.

254
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,259
Come on, man, say it.

255
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,861
Da-da,
daaa-da.

256
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:04,260
Y eah.

257
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,331
Alright, put your mom back on the phone.

258
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,378
Hey, Sharone.

259
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,774
Yeah, baby.

260
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,412
Yeah, baby, you know I
miss you, girl, right ?

261
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,834
You know that's why I'm here, though.

262
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:22,345
I'm here for you and the kids.

263
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:27,498
Yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, me too.

264
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,043
Your first?

265
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,403
Naw, my fifth.

266
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:32,180
Fifth ?

267
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,196
First little man. Look at that.

268
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:35,484
Aw, man.

269
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:36,553
Yeah.

270
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:37,876
He's a big boy.

271
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:39,171
What is this, CPT?

272
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,491
If you guys are done blowing
each other, we got work inside.

273
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,564
Yes, sir.

274
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:48,019
Yes um, master.

275
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:53,994
I'm about ready to pick your cotton
soon as I finish servicing your wife.

276
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:56,371
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

277
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,873
Muslims believe the Arabian
is a gift from Allah.

278
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:09,864
That anyone who treated it well
would be rewarded in the after life.

279
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,842
My insurance against
a life poorly lived ?

280
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:17,299
I heard about your wife, man.

281
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,666
Sorry.

282
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:22,969
I lost my viola when
I was in Leavenworth

283
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:24,754
Spinal meningitis.

284
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,313
Still haven't gotten over it.

285
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:32,128
So what brings you out here, Nick ?

286
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:36,226
I don't believe that it's because
you took a sudden shine to horses !

287
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:37,851
I got a gig.

288
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:38,874
It's a big one.

289
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:39,786
I could use your help.

290
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:41,521
Hey, I'm a granddaddy.

291
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:42,642
I'm retired.

292
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:43,626
Congratulations !

293
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:45,928
But you never retire from what we do.

294
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:47,704
You want me to work for you now ?

295
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,990
Well, nobody knows how to
move money around like you do.

296
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:51,474
How to wash it, how to clean it.

297
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,705
Cut the bullshit.

298
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,514
You're here because
someone took Roz moore down

299
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:56,561
and you're scrambling.

300
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,528
How much we talking?

301
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,057
30 to 40 mill. They have
to move it into Columbia.

302
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,855
With your share, you could
buy a whole herd of Arabians,

303
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:07,960
become a regular Maharaja!

304
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:09,839
When ?

305
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:10,640
Twelve days.

306
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,153
That's soon ?

307
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:14,127
How long you been working this ?

308
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,153
A week.

309
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:16,471
Short prep !

310
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:17,727
Doesn't sound like you !

311
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,034
Where's the gig ?

312
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:21,647
Thirty thousand feet over Cleveland.

313
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:24,274
You hittin' a plane ?

314
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:25,888
Where you taking off the jack ?

315
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:26,609
Here.

316
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:31,353
Man, I thought I taught
you better than that.

317
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:32,984
I didn't come down here
for a lecture, Riley.

318
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:37,415
Didn't I tell you never
work in your own backyard ?

319
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:38,817
This ain't my backyard no more.

320
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:43,577
You interested or what ?

321
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,569
Let me chew on it.

322
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:48,751
Ok.

323
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:54,895
Thanks for the beer.

324
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:00,408
Don't you worry you
might run into someone,

325
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:03,611
maybe your husband's friends
or something like that ?

326
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:04,439
Hmmm.

327
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,903
My husband's in insurance.
He doesn't have any friends.

328
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:09,807
Oh !

329
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,935
What's he do ?

330
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,824
I don't really know.

331
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,527
Real estate companies,
corporate policies.

332
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,654
Hmmm.

333
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,103
Does he do this ?

334
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:32,158
No, I can't remember the
last time he did that ?

335
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:35,527
You know, selling insurance must
be like selling anything else.

336
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,055
You have to have a soft touch.

337
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:38,991
Hmmm.

338
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:40,840
A really soft touch.

339
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,197
You can't push too hard.

340
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,126
No. No. Not...

341
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:47,407
too hard, just hard enough.

342
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,390
It's hot in here.

343
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:56,311
Oh god!

344
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,204
To start, we can go
for the Creole Gumbo !

345
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,358
Mm-hmm.

346
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:02,919
Look at that.

347
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:04,023
Mm-hmm.

348
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:05,569
Escargot sound better, huh ?

349
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,542
Mm-hmm.

350
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,237
We're ready to order.

351
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,212
Nick !

352
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,958
Yeah.

353
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,662
There's a guy in a car out front.

354
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,662
I know.

355
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,132
-  Well, I think it is one of the guys who is a
- I know.

356
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,149
Well, what is he doing here ?

357
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:28,541
Just keeping an eye on the place.

358
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:29,430
Why ?

359
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:30,757
It's better to be safe.

360
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,374
You think he's going to come
back ? That guy who was shot ?

361
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,565
Tammy, I wouldn't worry
about that. It's over.

362
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:38,605
That guy is back in Texas and
it's like it never happened.

363
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,870
But until you go to Hawaii

364
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,329
I want to know where you are

365
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,854
- Ok? At all times.
- Ok.

366
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:53,863
Keith ?

367
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,021
My dad.

368
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:56,617
Well, if you getha hold
of him, let me talk to him.

369
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:58,617
I've been trying to reach
him for a couple of days.

370
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:00,833
I know, I know, you can't
wait to get rid of me.

371
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,748
No, Tam,

372
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:03,453
I just want your father
to act like a father.

373
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,236
It's voicemail.

374
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:07,938
At least he's consistent.

375
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,588
Thanks for meeting me here.

376
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,661
No cuts and all folds.

377
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:37,924
It's a donation from the bump.

378
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,709
The bump ?

379
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:43,227
Yeah, the bump, that's
what they call me.

380
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,723
You know, like that song,

381
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:48,060
<i>You know, there's a bump on the log
with a hole in the middle of the sea.</i>

382
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:51,485
<i>There's a bump on the
log with a hole in the</i>

383
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,315
That's all right.

384
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:01,243
This is kind of a
funny place for a date.

385
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,076
Hmm.

386
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,453
I really, I really like churches.

387
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,995
I spent most of my
childhood growing up in them.

388
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,570
My daddy was preacher.

389
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,723
So, you got the calling early ?

390
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:19,818
Well, if I did,

391
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,873
I lost it a long time ago.

392
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,931
Well, then, why do you come to church ?

393
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,873
I see you here every night last week.

394
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:28,929
I've got a lot of things on my mind.

395
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,843
Talking to Jesus just,

396
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:34,467
Just makes me feel better.

397
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:40,329
Jesus saved my life.

398
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:46,058
I ran away when I was twelve

399
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,722
and got into some bad
trouble on the streets.

400
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,914
And then Reverend Bordeau
found me and showed me the way.

401
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,515
So you're not redeemed?

402
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,786
No, I'm afraid not.

403
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,498
But I feel as though I,

404
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:07,028
feel as though I could be

405
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,369
If you'd just let me kiss you.

406
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:18,273
Jack, we're in church !

407
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:20,753
I thought that made it better.

408
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,025
I thought that made it holy !

409
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:52,609
I'm bored.

410
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:55,776
Crisscross his numbers.

411
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,247
I'm sick of this shithole.

412
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:00,744
Hiring at six flags, bro.

413
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:03,529
That bitch had to know the crew, bro.

414
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:05,224
She didn't know anything.

415
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:06,127
Yeah.

416
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:07,521
Are you sure ?

417
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:11,139
'Cause she was the only contact,
and you went and killed her.

418
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,687
Now we got to run through every
god damned number on her cell phone,

419
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:15,031
or maybe you just lost your mojo !

420
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:20,320
You hit the wrong boy.

421
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:21,911
You diss me once more

422
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:24,170
and it won't matter who your uncle is.

423
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:02,582
The window was open.

424
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:04,414
I couldn't sleep.

425
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:08,062
So you're breaking into my files !

426
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:09,494
Give me that.

427
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:10,654
Give me that !

428
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,222
A key would have been easier.

429
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,374
I don't have a key.

430
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,080
Did mom have one ?

431
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:20,981
Just leave your mom out of this, ok ?

432
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,357
Why is this always locked ?

433
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,390
To keep nosey little
girls like you out !!

434
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,214
Now you can go through my
stuff if that's want, Tammy,

435
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:34,436
or you could ask me what
it is you want to know.

436
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,782
Did you ever lie to mom ?

437
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:36,821
About what ?

438
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:39,019
I don't know, anything !

439
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,142
Your business.

440
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,576
You ever lie to Keith ?

441
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,245
Lies come in many shapes, Tam.

442
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:46,550
And sometimes we lie to
protect the people that we love,

443
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,413
you understand ?

444
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:49,326
And I loved your mother.

445
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:53,850
So come on, let's go to bed.

446
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:22,413
There you go.

447
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:26,707
How big are these carts ?

448
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,132
Thirty inches wide,

449
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:29,053
four feet high,

450
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:30,451
thirty-six deep.

451
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:31,503
-That's tight.

452
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:32,771
-Yeah, but it's doable.

453
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:34,530
Don't forget, we're
going to have tools on us.

454
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:35,762
How long we have to be in there ?

455
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:37,209
About ninety minutes, or so,

456
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:38,333
that a problem ?

457
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:39,428
I'll handle it.

458
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:42,349
We're gonna need, um, forties.

459
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,955
Ok, now they're on a
GPS tracking system,

460
00:26:45,064 --> 00:26:47,500
but they're always going
in for maintenance, so,

461
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:49,482
if we were maintenance company...

462
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,410
We'll work it out.

463
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:54,506
And when you get them, disable the GPS so
bump can drive them to New York. All right?

464
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,027
Hey, Nick, let me
holler at you a second.

465
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,676
So look, I know that we're coming
down to the final stretch, but...

466
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:06,378
I've got to see my little boy.

467
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:08,692
You know, I've been gone a long time,

468
00:27:08,616 --> 00:27:10,948
and I need a couple days.

469
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:12,794
We're eleven days out, Mo.

470
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:13,946
I need you inside.

471
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,550
I know, that's why I'm just
gonna boost the carts and go.

472
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:17,524
Yeah, but that calls attention.

473
00:27:17,598 --> 00:27:18,722
That's not how we do it !

474
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:20,963
So, then we change the rules.

475
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:25,755
Nick,

476
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:28,196
I've got to see Sharona, man.

477
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,115
We're having issues.

478
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:38,867
I'm serious!

479
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:44,066
Well,

480
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:46,762
your issues are going to have to wait.

481
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,762
Oh, I see how it works.

482
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:54,769
Ok, no, no, so when your family has
problems, you can change the rules, right ?

483
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:57,587
That little white girl can
id us to a murder, Nick.

484
00:27:57,894 --> 00:27:59,915
But do we do what we did with Izzy ?

485
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:01,969
No, we changed the rules.

486
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:03,253
You want to make a run at my daughter ?

487
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,564
What, are you crazy ?

488
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:06,909
Well, if you had never come to my
house, none of this shit woulda happened.

489
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:07,685
All I'm saying to you

490
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,498
I know exactly what you're saying, Mo,

491
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,656
but all you do is talk.

492
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:14,753
Maybe you should go.

493
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:15,838
But let's just be clear.

494
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:17,125
If you go,

495
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,067
don't come back.

496
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:35,937
Don't stop now, baby, train's
almost at the station, come on.

497
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,522
Come on, honey.

498
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,016
Hey, you ok ?

499
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,616
Is it something I did ?

500
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:53,217
No, I'm just distracted.

501
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:55,264
Work.

502
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:58,351
I still don't understand
exactly what it is you do.

503
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,432
Communications.

504
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:01,017
Oh.

505
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,983
I design systems.

506
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:11,488
I just feel like there's a part
of you that's hidden, that's all.

507
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,816
Everyone loves a mystery.

508
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:19,743
So where's your husband ?

509
00:29:19,877 --> 00:29:21,255
At the office.

510
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,947
Hmmm.

511
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,465
Casualty underwriting.

512
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,792
That's his idea of intimacy.

513
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,271
You going to take a shower ?

514
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,288
Uh-huh.

515
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:53,903
God damned Microsoft, come on !

516
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:21,422
- Thirsty ?
- Thought you was on modified duty.

517
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:22,767
Hmm not for long.

518
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:26,175
I break this case I'm on, PIB
is going to give me a medal.

519
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,557
You'll be reading about
my ass in the papers, bro.

520
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:30,542
Yeah, I don't doubt that.

521
00:30:30,577 --> 00:30:32,805
Hey you got to see this.

522
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:35,110
What ya got ? What ya got ?

523
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:38,894
Oh, we raided, some poachers
over on honey island.

524
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:41,621
Found a dead gator !

525
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:43,023
Opened it up.

526
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:44,847
That right there popped out.

527
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:46,130
Where's the rest of him

528
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:47,205
They lookin'.

529
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,530
Here, don't be shy.

530
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,476
Hey ! Shake his hand.

531
00:30:49,478 --> 00:30:52,319
No, art, knock it off. Damn.

532
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:53,942
Boy, you are demented.

533
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:59,126
What's the story on that double
homicide over there on Perrier ?

534
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:00,815
Do you know anything about that ?

535
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:02,502
Whoever did it was a pro.

536
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:07,415
The department doesn't want it to get out,
but there were burn marks on that woman.

537
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:09,582
I think she was tortured first.

538
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:14,380
Found residue of potassium and nitrate
charcoal and sulfur on her body.

539
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:15,470
English, huh ?

540
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:18,879
That's a composition of black
powder meal, pyrotechnics,

541
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,693
Chinese cracker fuses,
that kind of thing ?

542
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:25,917
Looks like they just wrapped that
all around her and lit her up.

543
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:27,868
Are we close ?

544
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:28,982
No prints.

545
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:29,934
No motive.

546
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,373
Nada.

547
00:31:32,114 --> 00:31:33,709
Why, you on to something ?

548
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,910
No, not hardly, no.

549
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,195
If I were you'd be
the last to know, huh ?

550
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,906
No phone calls at dinner,

551
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:53,900
that's the rule.

552
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,334
Well, what if it's my dad ?

553
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:56,774
Check caller ID.

554
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:00,027
You can call Keith back.

555
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:14,994
Go on.

556
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:16,908
Go ahead.

557
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:24,411
Oh my god !

558
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:26,430
I opened your mother's
safe deposit box today.

559
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:27,636
That was passed down to her

560
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:30,506
from your great grandmother.

561
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:32,850
She always said she
wanted you to have it.

562
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,011
It's an emerald ?

563
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,090
Yes, good quality.

564
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:36,507
Hold it up to the light.

565
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,210
Can you see how deep the color is ?

566
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:41,124
Yeah.

567
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,387
And the inclusions minor.

568
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:45,613
It's beautiful !

569
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,195
Fits !

570
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:51,243
Sort of.

571
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:53,939
You should probably keep
that in a safe place.

572
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:55,546
She wore it at our wedding.

573
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:59,412
I saw the ring you
gave me at the wedding.

574
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:02,874
The little gold band.

575
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:06,955
I was trying to buy you off.

576
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:09,162
I don't think it worked.

577
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:12,026
Is that what you are trying to do now ?

578
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,434
Is that what you think ?

579
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:20,218
Did she leave me anything else ?

580
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:25,021
Yeah, a few other things
in the safe deposit box.

581
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,995
You'll get them when you're older.

582
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:29,025
I dreamt about her last night.

583
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,065
How'd she look ?

584
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:35,082
She was happy.

585
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,139
She was at the shore.

586
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,745
She had paint in her hair.

587
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,146
I dream about her every night.

588
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,099
Hum,

589
00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:06,810
I got invited to this girl
Jessica's birthday party on Friday.

590
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:11,019
Um, and I know it's only been a week,

591
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:14,161
but you know, Mom,
said I could go and...

592
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,280
I don't know, um,

593
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,713
parents going to be there ?

594
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:19,535
Sure, yeah.

595
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:21,649
Yeah ?

596
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,650
You can call them if you want.

597
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:33,202
Ok. Now your Mom would want
you to live your life, so sure.

598
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:35,697
But I pick you up and I take you, ok ?

599
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,114
Ok.

600
00:34:43,756 --> 00:34:44,420
It's fine,

601
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:45,880
It's fine, go ahead. It's fine !

602
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:47,502
I don't care.

603
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:04,239
Maybe later.

604
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:26,256
Yeah, so what did you
get for the verbal score ?

605
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,271
You can combine the two scores
from the last test that you took.

606
00:35:29,324 --> 00:35:30,320
What are you doing ?

607
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,631
Talking to my girlfriend.

608
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:34,998
Yeah, from the last one.

609
00:35:35,604 --> 00:35:36,432
Hey !

610
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,854
Sorry bro. It's the mark's phone.

611
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,846
Eah, well, she don't need it anymore.
Mine's on roaming. You know what that costs ?

612
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:44,981
You been using it to call the contacts ?

613
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:48,103
All right, listen bright boy,

614
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:50,927
anybody who has caller
ID isn't going to answer.

615
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,926
And all the cops have
to do is run her bill

616
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:55,398
and up pops your girlfriend's number.

617
00:35:55,811 --> 00:35:56,832
Good work.

618
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:14,191
Your mother let you wear that stuff ?

619
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:16,534
She taught me how to use it.

620
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:22,012
Oh, you can let me after.

621
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:24,286
This is a block away.

622
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:25,990
I know, but I, I want to walk.

623
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:38,320
Ok, so I'll be back to pick you up at
eleven. If you need me for anything, I'll just

624
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:40,002
I know, I know.

625
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:40,774
Just give me a

626
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:41,941
- Ok.
- Ok.

627
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,365
What do you want, Hays ?

628
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:59,254
I need passenger manifests on all flights from
San Francisco to New Orleans, October 11th ?

629
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:03,078
Run through the NCIC database
and check for aliases for me.

630
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,828
Aren't you on modified duty ?

631
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:08,632
I don't how these rumors get started,
but anyway, I'm looking for anybody

632
00:37:08,632 --> 00:37:12,028
with felony records,
especially bank robbery.

633
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:13,500
I'll see what I can do.

634
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,148
Yeah ?

635
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,238
Who's this ?

636
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:24,878
You called me.

637
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,534
This is Sam Shell with the New Orleans
police department. Can you identify yourself ?

638
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,828
You want to show me your
shield over the phone ?

639
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:33,678
You a friend a Rosalyn Moore ?

640
00:37:33,914 --> 00:37:35,012
Who ?

641
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:36,588
Your number was in her cell phone.

642
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,331
Nah.

643
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:40,342
Sorry, bro, I can't help you.

644
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,539
- You in place ?
- Locked and loaded.

645
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:06,075
Two uniforms in front.

646
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:20,747
Today,

647
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,828
you will be with me in paradise.
- Amen.

648
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,522
That's what Jesus promised on the cross.

649
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:30,825
- How many of you want to
take Jesus up on his promise ?

650
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:36,714
How many you want to meet
him over there, in paradise ?

651
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:21,674
How we doing, Gabo ?

652
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:24,441
All clear.

653
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:30,814
Now do you know who Jesus
was talking to on the cross ?

654
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:32,678
A thief.

655
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:39,288
A thief is the only person the
bible confirms is in paradise.

656
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,118
Ok, I found it.

657
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:49,958
What kind ?

658
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,542
Morgan guardian electronic keypad.

659
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:54,857
- Now we've all sinned.
- Yes, we have.

660
00:41:54,739 --> 00:42:00,799
Yet, we all carry within us
god's promise of salvation.

661
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,071

1-4-9-0.

662
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:15,663
So let Jesus wash away your sins,

663
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,006
and get down on your knees,

664
00:42:18,137 --> 00:42:23,133
get down on your knees and
ask Jesus to remember you.

665
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:25,597
When he comes into his kingdom.

666
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:27,334
When he rises.

667
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:30,557
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah !

668
00:42:33,155 --> 00:42:34,541
Yeah, I got the numbers.

669
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:38,266
But it's three strikes, I'm
out, the keypad's gonna lock up.

670
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:39,180
How we doing ?

671
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:40,293
You're cool.

672
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:42,197
All is right with the world.

673
00:43:06,242 --> 00:43:07,284
What happened ?

674
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:08,941
The AC switched on.

675
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,757
Did they see it ?

676
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,453
I don't think so.

677
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:18,806
Ok.

678
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,804
9...14... September 14th.

679
00:43:32,752 --> 00:43:34,277
Huh, happy birthday, Roz.

680
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:04,821
You owe me.

681
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,459
What did you find ?

682
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,660
Usual hits, tax evasions,

683
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:10,452
spousal abuse,

684
00:44:10,353 --> 00:44:11,572
a couple of drug possessions

685
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,773
and one aka of interest.

686
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:15,378
Did a stretch in fishkill.

687
00:44:18,295 --> 00:44:19,339
Looks good.

688
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:28,172
- Ya?
- It's me.

689
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,169
You're a damn good fisherman, boy.

690
00:44:32,288 --> 00:44:34,258
It's off the hook and good.

691
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:35,643
Yeah, what did I catch ?

692
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:38,195
I'm already regretting this, but...

693
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:39,987
I'm in.

694
00:44:40,696 --> 00:44:42,124
You still want me ?

695
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:43,419
Told you, Riley

696
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:46,242
Nobody retires.

697
00:44:46,232 --> 00:44:47,410
Let call you back.

698
00:44:58,271 --> 00:45:02,378
Excuse me sir, can I see your license and
registration and proof of insurance, please ?

699
00:45:02,855 --> 00:45:03,795
Sure.

700
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:09,747
There you go.

701
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:13,059
Would you mind getting out of the car ?

702
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:14,722
Is there a problem, officer ?

703
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,185
Just step out of the car, sir.

704
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:23,723
Stand right there, please.

705
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,042
I'm just, um,

706
00:45:29,965 --> 00:45:30,865
wait on my daughter.

707
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,185
She's at this party across the street.

708
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:38,009
Call Jim finch at the New Orleans
police department. You know, he knows me.

709
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:41,842
Sorry, sir,

710
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,481
we've had a rash of home invasion
robberies since the storm.

711
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:47,449
I understand, can't be too careful.

712
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:50,025
We've had a whole bunch
of them up at metter.

713
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:51,137
Daughter, huh ?

714
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:51,817
Yeah.

715
00:45:51,934 --> 00:45:53,258
Can't say I envy you.

716
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:55,744
You should see what we see.

717
00:45:56,564 --> 00:45:57,313
Hey.

718
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:01,785
Is this your daughter ?

719
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:04,177
Is this your father ?

720
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,168
Unfortunately.

721
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,145
What did he do now ?

722
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,066
Just an innocent bystander.

723
