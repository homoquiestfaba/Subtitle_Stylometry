Oliver?

4
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,527
I've been looking all
over the hotel for you.

5
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,112
Good morning, Mr. Kelleher.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,869
It hasn't been morning
for over an hour.

7
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,541
Really?

8
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,757
Guess I must have stayed out a
little later than I thought.

9
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,629
Look, it's not that I don't
love standing here evaporating.

10
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,263
But we got a wine tasting
to be at in 30 minutes.

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,434
Oh, come on! You already own more wine
than you could drink in 10 lifetimes.

12
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,852
What is the point?

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,269
Owning a great bottle of wine is
like owning a piece of history.

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,978
The way I see it, you can
never own too much history.

15
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,230
I'll keep that in mind.

(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

17
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,557
I thought 1964 was meant
to be rather a good year.

18
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,725
This tastes a bit goaty.

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,527
I don't mean to interrupt.

20
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:29,158
But in '64, the harvest began
the morning of September 17th

21
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,781
and shortly after those
dreadful rains began.

22
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,864
So whoever picked
early was unharmed.

23
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,459
If you are interested in '64
for tomorrow's auction, um,

24
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,787
I think you're better off
with the Petrus or Latour.

(DISMISSIVELY) Really, my dear?

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,084
I think you'll find my daughter
is right, she usually is.

00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,092
Thank you, Margaret.

Yes.

You wouldn't have any Budweiser
back there, would you?

Um...

33
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,322
This is a wine tasting.

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,203
- Morning, Richard.
- Hi.

35
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,455
- Which one of those would you go for?
- Um...

36
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,170
Well, they're both very nice, but
that one's bloody brilliant.

I can't make up my mind
between the Maggio and the...

Excuse me.

39
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,904
Those are two different wines.

40
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,865
They are both red.

41
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,198

Juicy Fruit '74.

43
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,880
You find this all
kind of amusing?

44
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,132
No, I find David
Letterman amusing,

45
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,001
this falls more to
the weird category.

46
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,544
Why are you here?

47
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,095
I got dragged here by Mr.
T.T. Kelleher.

48
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,678
Looks like he doesn't
like your wine too much.

49
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,023
Looks like nobody does.

50
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,354
You are quite
sophisticated, aren't you?

51
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,521
Absolutely, sophistication
is my strong suit.

52
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,206
Flirting with the customers, eh?

53
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,838
You won't understand this
concept, but I'm working.

54
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,873
Mmm.

55
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:56,005
You're just like your mother.
She was so, so American.

56
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,346
Can't believe Father
ever married her.

57
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,635
You know, Richard,
the only good thing

58
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,937
about being your half-sister

59
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,855
is that the other half isn't.

60
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,693
Do you know what gives me the
most pleasure in this world?

61

Fat men in high heels?

62
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:22,199
No, it's knowing what a bitter and
miserable old maid you're going to be.

63
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,045
Right.

64
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,922
- Goodbye.
- Thank you so much for coming.

65
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,676
Goodbye. Thank you.

Margaret, Richard and I have
work to do in the office,

67
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,089
you don't mind
tidying up, do you?

68
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,264
Not at all.

69
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,010
There's a good girl.

RICHARD: I thought we did
very well today, Father.

SIR MASON: I rather
think we did.

72
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,645

in less than a week.

74
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,570
Yeah, I don't see any problem.

75
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,033
Yes, Margaret.

76
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,278
I've, uh...

77
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,621
Everything's straightened up.

Thank you, dear.

finished in Belgium,

80
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,035

gonna send me on a trip?

00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,304

and scrub one, more like...

afraid I must laugh.

You are a person of
very little quality.

90
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,601
Why do you both bicker so much?

91
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,728
We bicker because
we are jealous.

92
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,859
Richard is jealous of anyone
who is better than he,

93
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,815
which includes every
living creature.

94
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:44,071
I'm jealous because I really
care about wine. I love it!

95
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,406
And you treat me like a servant,

96
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,832
while he gets every
opportunity that comes along.

97
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,743
You are not ready to be
sent out yet, Margaret.

98
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,796
When you are, naturally, being
totally fair, I'll send you.

99
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,332
But you must remember
you're still a child.

100
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,543
Father, I'm 28 years old.

101
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,300
This desk is 112 years old.

102
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,216
- We don't send it to catalog wines...
- Now, that's quite enough of that!

103
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,097
Just be patient, your opportunity
will come in due time.

104
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,723
All right, Richard,
where were we?

105
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,013
So it's no then?

106
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,899
When you are ready, dear.

107
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,351
That's what I thought you'd say.

108
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,524
- This is my resignation.
- Ooh.

109
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,656
That is good news.

110
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,613
When your mother left and insisted
on bringing you up in America,

111
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,784
I allowed it.

112
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,865
It was a decision I always
suspected would haunt me.

113
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,752
But this...

114
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:36,457
You stop it now or I should become,
I promise you, very angry.

115
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,881
I don't enjoy threats
a great deal.

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
Neither do I.

Damn. Truly, truly, damn!

119
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,693
Father, we should
celebrate her going.

120
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,278
Celebrate?

121
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,355
She knows more about wine
already than you'll ever learn.

122
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,115
And she willingly does
the work of four.

123
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,114
But Harwood's has never been
represented by a woman.

124
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,737
Yes. Well, perhaps
that's something

125
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,830
we ought to think
about changing.

A lawyer friend of mine acts for an

His client and absentee
landlord has recently died,

130

and this lawyer has asked me
to dispose of the wine cellar.

data are all in here.

for one day, Margaret.

you're probably better off.

On. (LAUGHS)

143

trouble finding the MacPherson Castle.

Yes, what about it?

Oh.

I know, I know this may be
hard for you to believe,

154
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,878
since I am at the
moment torturing you.

155
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,299
But you truly are one
of my favorite people.

156
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,170
So you must stop
holding back from us.

I'm not. I'm not.

158

No, you've discovered the
remainder of the formula.

Please, tell us where
you've hidden it.

160

Then we can all go back
to being friends again.

161
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,819
You must stop.

no intention of blinding you.

will be as good as ever.

But every time you blink
for the rest of your life,

00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:52,694
there will be an endurable
but rather sharp pain.

we wouldn't be disturbed.

He lives with his mother at
the little inn we passed.

402
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,952
Could he have planned
this himself?

403
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,335
That's doubtful, no. He's not
noted for his planning ability.

404
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,832
Shouldn't we go after him?

405
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:16,213
I think instead we might pay a
little visit to the mother,

406
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,803
and see if we can convince her
to tell us where he is going.

the destination

but I assured them that the
bottle was now totally secure.

528
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,512
Is there some reason
you're walking funny?

529
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,190
The bottle is gone.

530
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,269
Those guys from the
castle just stole it.

531
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,529
Don't be ridiculous,
it's in my room.

532
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,198
(GROANING)

533
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,327
See, it's right there.

534
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,922
Well, then they stole the box.

535
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,084
Why would someone
steal a wooden box

536
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,132
and leave a $1 million
bottle of wine?

537
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,305
All I know is, I
just hate Scotland.

538
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,481
OLIVER: Yeah, it's about
a three-hour drive.

539
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,945
Yeah, no problem.

540
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,281
All right.

541
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,911
Yeah, 11:00?

542
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,999
Good. Okay, great.
Yeah, thanks, bye.

543
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,453
Hey.

544
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,386
You know, I love being summoned

545
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,006
in that suave, gentlemanly
manner of yours.

546
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,095
And it's Miss Hey.

547
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,601
What?

548
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,519
The company people are handling
your car and the chopper.

549
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,109
I have a plane ready
for us in the morning.

550
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,411
Great. I'll see you
in the morning.

551
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,956
I usually sleep on the right.
But I'm flexible.

552

(LAUGHS)

553
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,921
My God, the arrogance.

554
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,596
What am I supposed to do,
fall into your arms?

555
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,928
Helpless, grateful
and quivering?

556
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,217
Quivering's good.

557
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,058
Is it your beauty or your charm
that makes you so irresistible?

558
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,981
Uh... Sixty-forty charm.

559
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,611
Do women actually fall for this?

560
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,654
A surprising number, yeah.

561
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,871
I fear I may have a
bit too much pride.

562
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,792
After all, in a week, you
won't even remember my name.

563
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,587
I can't remember it now.

564
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,669
Wait a second.

565
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,097
If this is based on
the fact that in

566
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,845
the helicopter I
said I wanted you,

567
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,145
well, at the time, I
thought we were gonna die.

568
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:57,023
I didn't see any need to
crush your fragile male ego.

569
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,024
Goodnight, Oliver.

570
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,320
Goodnight. Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

571
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,444
Oliver.

572
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,745
I don't know how to
break this to you.

573
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,542
But you're not as charming
as you think you are.

574
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,704
And you're not as clever
as you think you are.

575
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,550
And I'm certainly not as
desperate as you think I am.

576
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,212
Wait, wait. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

577
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:28,057
Look, Maggie, you
got me all wrong.

578
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,725
I...

579
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,933
I don't think I'm that charming.

580
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,603
And I know I'm not that clever.

581
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,534
And I certainly don't
think you're desperate.

582
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:57,913
Besides, you probably have
a wife and three kids.

583
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,759
I don't even have a dog.

584
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,899
Look, Oliver.

585
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,694
I'm flattered, really.

586
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:28,901
But...

587
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,821
It's just not me.

588
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,790
I understand.

589
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,669
I'll see you in the morning.

590
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:50,798
Mmm.

591
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,103
I changed my mind.

592
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,437
Okay.

593
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,579
OLIVER: Maggie, could
you do me a favor?

594
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,576
Depends.

595
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,996
What have you done
for me lately?

596
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,171
Call the airport and see if
Kelleher's plane is ready.

597
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,297
All right, what's the number?

598
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,929
It's on a little piece of
yellow paper in my wallet.

599
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,542
Did you find it?

600
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,462
Yeah.

601
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,472
I'll call from my room.

602
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:15,932
Great, thanks.

603
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,396
OLIVER: Tell me something. In Scotland,
do you have to fly on the left?

604
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:36,238
Look, is it just me, or does it seem
like we stopped talking to each other?

605
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,077
Well, goodbye, Oliver, I hope
you have a wonderful life.

606
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,578
Excuse me?

607
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,743
Now that you have the
bottle safely to the plane,

608
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,545
I've decided to hang
around Glasgow for a bit.

609
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,798
Maybe I can pick up some
extra cash hooking.

610
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,084
Look, I don't know why,

611
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:54,138
but it appears that you're a little
upset about what we did last night.

612
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,511
And I am more than happy
to talk about it.

613
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,638
But I prefer to do it
once we're airborne.

614
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,140
Not that I'm superstitious, but
the last time I was on a runway,

615
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,563
I got the shit kicked out of me.

616
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,848
- (GROANS)
- Ah!

617
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,656
Ah!

618
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,075
Excuse me.

619
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,827
Um, excuse me.

620
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,950
Please, do not be brave.

621
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,997
Oh, but that's not your bottle.

622
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,825
Oh, but my dear one, it is.

623
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,295
What a splendid-looking
woman you are.

624
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,790
Sensual.

625

The glorious aura of sex
emanates from your perfect body.

626
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,095
Leave this life of crime.

627

thieves and evildoers.

630
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,439
I must go.

631
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,270
And it pains me.

632
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:55,324
In 10 years, you will be
even a greater marvel.

633
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:59,703

will fling themselves at you.

637
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,050
Oh, I'm great.

638
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,516
After a beating, there's
nothing I enjoy more

639
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,563
than watching a woman
I just made love to

640
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,561
play licky-face with
some greaseball.

641
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,233
Oliver, they stole the wine.

642
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,694
I know, I was right here.

643
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,363
Well, what are we
gonna do about it?

644
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,273
Oh, now it's "we" again.

645
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,450
Oliver, follow their plane.

646
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,874
OLIVER: I can't believe we're
doing all this for a beverage.

647
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,716
Do you know people would cross
oceans to taste that wine?

648
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,052
I would give anything in the
world for just one sip.

649
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,879
Well, maybe you'll
get lucky someday.

650
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,717
You know, your ignorance
is very impressive.

651
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,388
That bottle is much too
valuable just the way it is.

652
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,017
It will never be opened.

653
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,881

have rented a car instead.

you want this bottle?

Extraordinarily badly.

Leaving the bottle behind, but
we had no interest in it then.

742

needed the box.

trying to retrieve the
formula and make his escape.

754
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,648
And at first, we thought he
had written it on the box.

to be incorrect,

756

we completely
ransacked the cellar.

757
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:04,578
Nothing was there of interest,
so we deduced that the formula

758
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,161
had to be with the bottle.

01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,350

else is there?

01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,508
Absolutely.

868
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,304
You mean he wants to get bigger?

869
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,934
Younger. He wants
to get younger.

870
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,560

reversal at Kelleher's labs.

you were working with was flawed.

bodies of their youth.

surging through my groin.

dozen different women.

is time for you to join

my life, I'm in love.

Now, all I'm asking is that you
let me propose before you shoot.

such a romantic. By all means.

going to be able to do this once,

climbed up that cliff.

gonna get shot anyway,

rung the doorbell.

without my permission,
