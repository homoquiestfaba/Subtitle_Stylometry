00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,000
[Parker] Cheers, Sandra.

353
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,333
Thanks, Sandra.

354
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,416
Love you, Sandra.

355
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,625
[horn honking]

356
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,666
[Bailey] To Stone.

357
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,166
- First time out of the van.
- [all] Hey!

358
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,309
- [Bailey] And she didn't blow the op...
- [Yang] No, we did that all on our own.

359
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,500
Too bad. Been on a good winning streak
since Stone joined us.

360
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,916
Thought you might be our lucky charm.
But you did win at blackjack.

361
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,958
And I'm never gambling again
or stepping out of the van.

362
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,291
What'd you do when I left you up there?

363
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,708
[inhales] Hid in the toilets.

364
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,208
[both laughing]

365
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,250
- What? You said to stay out of sight.
- True.

366
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,958
All right. Leave her alone.

367
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,833
We got more important things to discuss.

368
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,291
Like, the girl.

369
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,458
But let's be honest.
We already know who she works for.

370
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,125
- [sighs] God.
- That's right. The Charter.

371
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,000
- Strap yourselves in.
- [Yang laughs]

372
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,500
Whatever. I just identified
another one of their ops.

373
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:33,041
They took out a terror cell who hijacked
an oil tanker in the Panama Canal.

374
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,708
Yeah, but who would have
that kind of power?

375
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,291
[Parker] Hm.

376
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,458
- I'm doing it again, aren't I?
- Yeah.

377
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,125
Okay, fine, mock me.

378
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,291
But it's true.

379
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:46,083
Ex-intelligence operatives
answering only to themselves.

380
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,666
No national allegiances,
no political leanings.

381
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,125
Putting out fires their governments
never allowed them to. That's...

382
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,333
That's the Charter.

383
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,500
The most highly trained agents

384
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,666
working together to keep peace
in a turbulent world.

385
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,166
No. That is a Saturday morning cartoon.

386
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,791
Nobody knows about
the Charter because they don't exist.

387
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,791
Pass me the vinegar.

388
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,041
- And this girl.
- [laughs]

389
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,541
This girl is part of it, and you know it.

390
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay, don't judge me.
I'm gonna go with this for a sec.

391
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,458
- If the Charter are such do-gooders...
- Mm.

392
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,101
...why'd the girl interrupt our mission?

393
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,125
[Parker] Oh. Oh!

394
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,583
That's a good question. Yep.

395
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:28,083
Sorry, Bailey, there is no secret genius
organization pulling all the strings.

396
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,875
It's just us, Sandra, and her paperwork.

397
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,541
But it was a nice bedtime story.
Speaking of which...

398
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,458
Already?

399
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,875
- Jet lag.
- Um, there's a one-hour time difference.

400
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,583
Night, guys.

401
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,166
- Night.
- Night.

402
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,125
[laughs] Right in the eye.

403
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,958
- I drive with that eye.
- Might make you a better driver.

404
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,833
[Yang] Can't make you worse.

405
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,291
- Kidding. I take it back.
- [Parker] No.

406
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,625
[siren wailing]

407
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,583
[pen cap opens]

408
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,500
[pen cap closes]

409
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,375
[pen cap opens]

410
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,500
[pen cap opens]

411
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
[pen cap closes]

412
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:12,875
Sneaking up on me?

413
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,708
A field agent
should be ready for anything.

414
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:21,166
You were saying?
I never should have told you I swim.

415
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,875
A weak moment.

416
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,708
I liked it.

417
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,083
So... the girl.

418
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:29,916
What news?

419
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,250
No news. We were told not to look.

420
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,000
You're a terrible liar.

421
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:38,250
Look, if we leave it
to the pen-pushers at MI6,

422
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,583
she'll hack the entire world
before we even get a name.

423
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,326
I should've gone beyond the mission
and brought her in.

424
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,875
Well, your hands were pretty full
at the time.

425
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,375
And besides, it wasn't our objective.

426
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,916
Why don't you try and live a little?
Could be fun.

427
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,333
What happened to
"Don't get out of the van, Rachel"?

428
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,416
Ah.

429
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,250
- This is different.
- Hm.

430
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,000
So, rules are rules
unless they apply to you.

431
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,750
Why do I feel like you know me better
than I know you?

432
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,791
Maybe I should listen to one of these
dreary podcasts of yours.

433
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,666
<i>- ♪ Don't stop thinking about tomorrow</i>... <i>♪</i>
- Ah.

434
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,958
Bailey got to you, huh?

435
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,958
Mock our music,
and I won't tell you my theory.

436
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:16,166
My lips are sealed.

437
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:20,916
[song ends]

438
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,958
She's new to the scene. Has to be.

439
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,625
Otherwise, we would have heard about her.

440
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,666
To get a guest list like that...

441
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,375
She's working with someone else.
A veteran. But who?

442
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:36,083
We'll make a list. I'll bring snacks.

443
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:41,541
I, uh, I'm sorry.
I already have... a brunch date.

444
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,375
Can I come?

445
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:47,708
Bye, Parker.

446
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:54,333
[tense music playing]

447
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,708
[card reader whirring]

448
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,458
[Stone] Ivo? It's been a while.

449
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,416
Nine of Hearts, it's good to see you.

450
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,291
- How's it going?
- It's been busy. This way.

451
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,916
{\an8}The Charter has been dealing with
three actionable threats this morning.

452
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,375
Potential sarin gas attack in Paris.

453
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:30,916
The Heart predicted the time and location
of the attack with 87% certainty.

454
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,833
Eight of Hearts is on site now.

455
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,291
{\an8}Six is defusing
a potential international incident

456
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,750
in the South China Sea.

457
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:43,000
And Diamonds team's handling hackers
targeting the North American power grid.

458
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,416
That, um... That's the peacock.

459
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,000
- Hi.
- Came with the house.

460
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,333
{\an8}- [peafowl caws]
- [Stone] Hey, Jack.

461
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,625
{\an8}Enjoying your new office?

462
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,958
{\an8}We can't all be
gallivanting around the Alps.

463
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,458
{\an8}How's King of Hearts? Is she angry?

464
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,666
Have you seen her yet?

465
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,291
Well, let's see. You lost control
of the situation, target is dead,

466
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,916
then you had to kill six men.

467
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,208
What a glorious outcome.

468
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,416
- Victoria Crosses all around.
- [Stone] Morning, Nomad.

469
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,625
Good to see you too.
Love what you've done with the place.

470
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,833
Is she developing a sense of humor?

471
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
- Did you find the girl?
- Of course.

472
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,250
Keya Dhawan.

473
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,083
She is from Pune in the west of India.

474
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:27,791
Orphaned at eight.

475
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,458
[Stone] How'd she learn to program?

476
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,208
Ever heard of Niam Kharche?

477
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,750
Billionaire investor, pharmaceuticals.

478
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,250
Had business in Pune.

479
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,333
Ran IT workshops for kids
in underprivileged communities.

480
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,583
[Stone] He spotted her
in one of these programs.

481
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:47,333
Yeah. He saw she was a prodigy,
took her under his wing, trained her up,

482
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,833
and then they had a falling out.

483
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:50,916
Why?

484
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,050
[Nomad]
The Heart's better at whats than whys.

485
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,958
And the what is,
she split from Kharche and disappeared.

486
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,166
She's 22 now.

487
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,458
Not much older than when we met.

488
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:05,333
[Nomad] Yes, but she fell in with
a bunch of criminal lowlifes.

489
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,250
Some people get all the luck.

490
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:12,083
We think that Keya
set up the casino of blood.

491
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:15,916
She knew about Mulvaney's
gambling habit and used it to lure him in.

492
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Why?

493
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:22,291
Mulvaney had become
obsessed with a new weapon, a myth.

494
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:26,875
A quantum computer sophisticated enough
to hack into anything, anywhere.

495
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The Heart.

496
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,416
So, where is she now?

497
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,291
The Heart predicts with 96% certainty

498
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,291
that Keya is heading to Lisbon
for the opening of Club Moritz.

499
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,291
So, we will leak her location to MI6.

500
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,875
Then we should have your operation
back up and running within 24 hours.

501
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,625
It doesn't feel right.

502
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,375
Keya chose to hack into
our comms feed on the mountain.

503
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,916
She revealed herself to me,
looked me straight in the eye.

504
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,583
I'm not sure
if we should ignore the Heart,

505
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:07,333
the closest mankind
has to perfect intelligence,

506
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,166
because of eye contact in a bar.

507
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,916
This might be why you're single, Jack.

508
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,250
Just follow the numbers.

509
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,500
Your mission is Lisbon.

510
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,500
And if she's not there?

511
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,583
Eat tapas.

512
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,041
Just not with your MI6 team.

513
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,125
So, you're spying on <i>me</i> now.

514
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,458
I'm tracking my asset.

515
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,571
You know what you signed up for.

516
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,041
No relationships. No friends.

517
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,208
No poolside tête-à-tête.

518
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,291
What we do is too important.

519
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,916
When governments fail,
the only thing left is the Charter.

520
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,791
I'm undercover. This is just part of it.

521
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,250
- Everything's under control.
- Good.

522
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,625

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,458
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

703
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:52,000
Whoa!

704
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,833
Oh, okay. Okay, you got it.

705
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,916
[dramatic music playing]

706
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:03,625
[Bailey groans]

707
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,125
Yang.

708
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,083
- Got it.
- On your three o'clock.

709
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,958
In three, two, one.

710
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,333
[horn honking]

711
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,833
Clip's out.

712
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,666
[engine revving]

713
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,791
[horns honking]

714
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,083
[yells]

715
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,500
[tires screeching]

716
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
[grunts]

717
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,500
- Are you trying to kill us?
- Pretty much the opposite, actually.

718
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,166
[tram bell clanging]

719
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:06,125
Okay. This might be kind of intense.

720
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Oh, this isn't good.

721
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:54,333
- Stone, they're still coming.
- I know.

722
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,833
Hold on.

723
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:03,750
[horns honking]

724
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,250
[music fades]

725
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:37,791
Well, I can't speak for the others,
but I... I think you're ready for the field.

726
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,875
[tense music playing]

727
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,875
We need to get off the road
and lose this van.

728
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,375
[brakes screeching]

729
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,333
[Yang] Rachel.

730
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:20,958
Rachel.

731
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,291
Stone.

732
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,458
Who the hell are you?

733
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:35,916
It's complicated.

734
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,041
- [sighs]
- From where I'm sitting,

735
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,750
a baby agent from IT
just took out an entire kill team.

736
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,333
- Bailey, what's taking you so long?
- Shit.

737
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,500
The Charter?
You're the... you're the bloody Charter?

738
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:50,708
What, are you trying to
bring in Dhawan yourself?

739
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,833
Are you working with her?

740
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:56,916
[Yang] Answer him.

741
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,125
You owe us that.

742
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:02,458
We're after her too.

743
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,250
Oh my God.

744
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,333
The Charter's real.

745
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,666
And you're one of them.

746
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:12,166
I wish I could've told you more.

747
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:14,625
But we all want the same thing.

748
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:16,583
No, we don't.

749
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:18,875
[Stone gasps]

750
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,500
You're not the only one with a secret.

751
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,833
Did they mean something to you?

752
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,333
Oh, come on, Rachel.
You're only playing a part, right?

753
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,750
Who are you, Parker?

754
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,291
Why don't you ask the Heart?

755
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,833
If you wanted me dead,
you would have shot me first.

756
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,833
[exhales]
Still a few things I need to know.

757
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,708
About you, the Charter.

758
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:56,958
But perhaps most of all,

759
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,666
I was looking forward to a fight.

760
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,416
[Stone grunting]

761
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,166
[Stone winces]

762
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,791
- [groans]
- Talk.

763
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:20,666
Keya and I learned
that the Charter infiltrated MI6.

764
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,166
[Parker exhales deeply]

765
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,625
I had to flush out who.

766
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,166
At first, I thought it was Yang,

767
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:28,750
but I was so pleased it was you.

768
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,291
Keya's working for you?

769
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,208
Your hand's shaking.

770
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,458
You barely nicked me.

771
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,166
That was the point.

772
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:42,958
Poison-tipped.

773
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,416
A little basic, I know,
but it hits the spot.

774
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:47,916
[Stone groans]

775
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,833
Looks like the paralysis is kicking in.

776
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,666
I spent six years
looking for you people, Stone.

777
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:57,583
Then fate brings you straight to me.

778
00:50:58,458 --> 00:50:59,791
You're a very good agent.

779
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:04,833
But you were so busy letting a machine
think for you that you missed me.

780
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Right here,

781
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,541
in front of your face...

782
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:12,791
the whole time.

783
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,791
And Mulvaney?

784
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:19,666
Oh...

785
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,000
Well, he was tech-averse like me.

786
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,333
Kept everything up here.

787
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:29,416
So, Keya and I set up
our casino of blood to lure him in.

788
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:33,458
We needed to have a little chat
about the Heart.

789
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:34,958
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

790
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,166
[Parker] Talk.

791
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,250
Yeah, I...

792
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:43,625
<i>The Heart is
what gives the Charter its power.</i>

793
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:47,333
<i>It's the most formidable weapon
you never knew existed.</i>

794
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:49,875
<i>It can hack into anything, anywhere.</i>

795
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:55,458
<i>Cell phones, power grids, the banks,
governments, military, health records.</i>

796
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,750
<i>Your secrets.</i>

797
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,083
<i>It knows you
better than you know yourself.</i>

798
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:02,750
<i>It's determinism.</i>

799
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,708
<i>With access to trillions of data points
at once, its modeling is so accurate</i>

800
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,250
<i>it can predict the future.</i>

801
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,166
<i>The Heart is knowledge and power.</i>

802
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:17,416
<i>It can crash a market
or drop a plane out of the sky.</i>

803
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:22,125
<i>Who needs to steal a nuclear bomb
when you can control them all?</i>

804
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:24,875
<i>If you own the Heart...</i>

805
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,833
<i>you own the world.</i>

806
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,750
Where is it?

807
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,833
Where... is it?

808
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:44,291
Only a Charter member could tell you.

809
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,458
The poison's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

810
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,166
Cold War paralytic.

811
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
My chemist does all the classics.

812
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:56,625
Like cyanide.

813
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,416
[grunting]

814
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,208
[groaning softly]

815
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:09,458
Oh, relax, Rachel.

816
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:15,041
Killing you is not part of the plan.
We need you to deliver a package first.

817
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,458
- [groans]
- I've loved working with you, Rachel.

818
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,458
Hand on heart.

819
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:40,583
[device whirring]

820
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,208
[machines beeping]

821
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:18,958
[Nomad] Stone?

822
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,375
Stone?

823
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,625
She's awake. She's awake.

824
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:27,833
[Stone grunts]

825
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:30,375
[nurse panting]
Hold her here. Hold her down.

826
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,333
[alarm blaring]

827
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:33,416
Oh shit.

828
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:38,625
- [grunting]
- Take this. Help me. Help me here.

829
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:40,583
Keep her steady.

830
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,916
Cholinest... Cholines...

831
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,083
Wait. Get me atropine. Five mils.

832
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,708
{\an8}It's cholinesterase.

833
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:48,958
Jack. Jack.

834
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:51,125
- [Jack] We've been breached.
- How?

835
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:54,916
It's... There's a Trojan
in our system delivered wirelessly.

836
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,791
Chewing through security
like it isn't there.

837
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:57,875
Restrict all access.

838
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:01,000
Nomad, I've tried. No-go.
They're trying to access the Heart.

839
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:03,333
[Nomad] From where? We're walled off.

840
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:04,833
[alarm continues]

841
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,791
It's a weak wireless signal.
It's coming from...

842
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,958
inside the building.

843
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:14,333
Stone.

844
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:16,375
[doctor] Quickly.
We need to monitor her airway.

845
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:17,291
[panting]

846
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,166
- [nurse] Go ahead.
- [doctor] Hold her.

847
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,791
Press down.

848
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,166
That didn't do it.

849
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
[groans]

850
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,625
[Stone grunting]

851
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:33,791
[alarm ends]

852
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,083
- [Stone breathing heavily]
- Stone.

853
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,333
What's happened?
I need to know what's happened.

854
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:41,875
How long were we compromised?

855
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:45,166
[Jack] Three minutes and 45 seconds.
Running a system check now.

856
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,625
We need to know what they accessed.
Is the Locker safe?

857
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:48,916
Boom.

858
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,583
The Locker is still flying high

859
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,083
with the Heart safe inside,
85,000 feet up.

860
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:56,001
No one's getting up there
without a space shuttle.

861
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:58,625
It's passing over the Atlantic,
towards West Africa.

862
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,083
{\an8}And the other suits,
can they still access the Heart?

863
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:04,041
{\an8}- Looks like it... Jesus.
- What?

864
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,791
There've been
100,000 attempts to access files.

865
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:10,208
{\an8}Clubs team are analyzing the data,
but looks like our security held.

866
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,083
We need to shut it all down now.

867
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:16,250
- Shut what down? The Heart?
- Until we know what they've done.

868
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,833
We have no idea what they're capable of.

869
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:21,458
Don't need to shut it down
to find out what they've done.

870
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:24,208
- We'd be harming ourselves.
- We don't know. She's not stupid.

871
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:26,875
- And neither are we.
- Sure about that? Because right now...

872
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:28,666
Rachel. Rachel. He's right.

873
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,750
We'll sort it.

874
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,375
"We"?

875
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,208
A word in private. Now.

876
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:47,291
I told you. I knew Keya
was playing us, playing the Heart.

877
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:49,500
No, you didn't. No, you didn't
You had a feeling.

878
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:52,500
Nothing... nothing concrete,
nothing actionable.

879
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,541
A mood, a notion, a hunch, a bollocks.
We don't trade in those.

880
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,958
I knew she wouldn't be there.

881
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,375
You ignored the Heart,
and you went back in.

882
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,333
- To save my team.
- They weren't your team.

883
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:03,750
They died anyway.
You going back made sure of that.

884
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:08,041
You blew your cover.

885
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:11,916
If you'd left when we told you to,
Parker would've followed you,

886
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,375
we'd have caught him,
and Yang and Bailey might be alive.

887
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,625
- I should've just listened to the Heart?
- Yes.

888
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,333
[Stone sniffles]

889
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,958
The Charter exists for one reason.

890
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:34,458
To maximize lives saved.
That's the only moral metric there is.

891
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:38,291
And it's a calculation.
A pure and objective calculation.

892
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,958
Made for us by a machine.

893
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:42,125
Have you forgotten how radical that is?

894
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:47,708
It doesn't mean
that what we do is easy or feels nice.

895
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:50,851
You'll have the voices of those people
in your head for the rest of your life.

896
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:54,541
And you will never
not feel responsible for them ever.

897
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:58,166
But the end justifies the means.

898
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:04,708
I spent every day with Parker
for a year and didn't see it coming.

899
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:07,458
No.

900
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:09,416
Neither did the Heart.

901
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,791
So, what do we do now?

902
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,708
[groans] I'm...

903
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,791
Gonna make some tough choices,
and this is the first one.

904
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,166
I'm standing you down, Rachel.

905
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:27,541
Go home. Get some rest.

906
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,875
Keep your head down.
Don't do anything stupid.

907
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:32,916
You can't do this.

908
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,125
You're compromised.

909
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:36,875
Parker knows you. Dhawan knows you.

910
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:40,750
And the other Kings, quite rightly...
don't know if you can be trusted.

911
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:42,375
And you?

912
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:48,375
I want to protect what we've spent
20 years trying to build.

913
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,208
So, I'm just out.

914
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:55,875
It's about the greater good.

915
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,625
It's nothing personal.

916
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:00,125
No.

917
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,875
I'm starting to see that.

918
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:33,083
[cell phone ringing]

919
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:34,166
[man] Hello?

920
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
- Stone? Wrong number. Wait.
- It's for me.

921
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,121
[man] That's my phone. I...

922
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:43,250
[Keya] <i>So, why is a Charter agent
riding around all alone</i>,

923
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,125
<i>just hours after being poisoned?</i>

924
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:48,666
Doesn't feel like they're taking care of
their most valuable player.

925
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,750
What do you want?

926
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,666
[Keya] <i>Don't be a sore loser.</i>

927
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,333
<i>I bet you used to think we were so alike.
Now you know I'm better.</i>

928
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:58,125
Better? You killed my friends.

929
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,333
What?

930
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,250
[Stone] <i>You didn't know, huh?</i>

931
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,958
Well, I told you this wasn't a game, Keya.

932
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,958
Heart or no Heart,

933
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:09,333
I'm coming for you.

934
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,250
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

935
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,666
[man] Nomad. Great spot.

936
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:36,125
All four kings in the same room.
How long has it been, three years?

937
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,041
Not long enough.

938
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:43,583
So, who is this Parker,
and how did we miss him?

939
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,083
Career intelligence agent.
Born in Belfast, lives alone.

940
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:51,708
He has no one he cares for.
There's nothing much to live for.

941
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:56,750
He has devoted his life
to a country that sees him as expendable.

942
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,833
Okay. We get it.
All that is fuel for the fire.

943
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:03,625
- But it won't burn without a spark.
- [woman] I was getting to that.

944
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:08,875
I had to lean extremely hard on
some very old friends for this.

945
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,750
Chechnya, December 2015.

946
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,041
What's this?

947
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:19,083
It was before your time.
Before the Heart, for that matter.

948
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:24,291
A Chechen warlord was given free rein
by the Chechen and Russian governments.

949
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The West, as always, were
looking the other way.

950
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:32,041
He was wiping out whole villages,
trying to stamp out dissent.

951
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,333
But... what's this got to do with Parker?

952
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,291
He was there.

953
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:39,041
[tense music playing]

954
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:44,125
Different identity. No electronic records.

955
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:47,000
But he was there, with MI6,

956
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,000
delivering weapons
to take the warlord out.

957
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:54,250
[man] Any sign of them?

958
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,416
You got an ETA yet?

959
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,500
They'll be here.

960
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:07,916
[woman] We intercepted a communication.

961
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:09,958
It was a trap.

962
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:11,916
[soldier shouts in Russian]

963
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:15,750
[soldiers speaking Russian]

964
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:21,916
[King] Intelligence came through from MI6
that their entire team had been executed.

965
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,791
We thought there was no one left to save.

966
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:24,708
[gun firing]

967
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:28,333
The region was a tinderbox
on the verge of full civil war.

968
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:31,500
We couldn't let those weapons
fall into the warlord's hands.

969
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,833
It would have cost thousands of lives.

970
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,416
We had a drone that was stationed
overhead armed with missiles.

971
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,333
I gave the order myself.

972
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:59,458
We made it look like a rebel force
had ordered the drone strike.

973
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,875
MI6 buried their mistake.

974
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:04,791
No report, no investigation.

975
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:08,916
No record of the personnel
who had been involved.

976
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,416
We thought everyone had died.

977
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,250
[groans]

978
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,041
Until a few hours ago.

979
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,041
What a mess.

980
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:23,958
So, you think... he knows it was us?

981
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,708
I think that's a safe assumption.

982
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:32,041
And now he wants to destroy the Charter.

983
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,541
You killed Bailey and Yang?

984
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:42,625
That wasn't the plan.

985
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,875
You stick to the tech
and leave strategy to me, okay?

986
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:50,125
Let me remind you, we're partners. Okay?
So if you want me to do my job,

987
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,916
you have to tell me
what you're doing before you do it.

988
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:55,458
Let me remind you,
the Charter don't give two shits

989
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,250
about people like Bailey and Yang.

990
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,875
So, if you want us to succeed,
you shouldn't either.

991
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,083
[tense music intensifies]

992
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:21,708
[tense music ends]

993
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:31,166
[door handle rattling]

994
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,291
[door opens]

995
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:48,958
[serene music playing]

996
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,000
[cat meows]

997
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:56,875
[Stone] Hey, Barry.

998
01:04:57,583 --> 01:04:59,375
I'm a friend of your dad's.

999
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:04,041
It's okay.

1000
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:06,833
[cat purring]

1001
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:15,750
[whispers] I've got you.

1002
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,041
The camera.

1003
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:50,291
[suspenseful music playing]

1004
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,041
She hacked into the camera feed.

1005
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,208
Let's see how well she covered her tracks.

1006
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:06,791
[beeping]

1007
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,125
There she is.

1008
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,791
What's in the desert, Keya?

1009
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,833
I'm guessing it's not the nightlife.

1010
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:28,750
Are you shitting me?

1011
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,208
West Africa. The Locker.

1012
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:37,583
{\an8}[Parker] You ever done this before?
Choppered in at over 40,000 feet?

1013
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:40,041
Trick question. No one has.

1014
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,708
But my mama always said
I could do anything.

1015
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,958
How long do we have
before the Locker descends?

1016
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:47,750
Eleven hours and seven minutes.

1017
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,291
At which point,
the Charter will realize what's going on.

1018
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:55,583
It'll take nine minutes and 26 seconds
for the Locker to drop to 40,000 feet.

1019
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:58,250
We'll have about eight minutes
to get in, take the Heart,

1020
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,125
and get out again
before they regain control.

1021
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,250
Very precise.

1022
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,375
You're sure?

1023
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:05,791
No. I'll be sure when it descends.

1024
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:10,083
If they found my code, it won't descend,
they'll be waiting for us, and we all die.

1025
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:19,166
- Hey.
- Good morning.

1026
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,250
What time is it?

1027
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:22,250
Uh, it's nearly seven.

1028
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,375
What? Oh shit.

1029
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:24,708
[Ivo] Any luck?

1030
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,083
Uh... nothing. But they need to
pop their heads up at some point.

1031
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,000
- I'll see if they...
- [alarm blaring]

1032
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:37,291
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

1033
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:40,208
Get Nomad now! Get Nomad now!

1034
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,541
Just get me up there. I'll do the rest.

1035
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,666
Nomad will string me up for this.

1036
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,083
Tell her I stole your keys.

1037
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:56,583
You'll just have to trust me.

1038
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,916
[Keya] Okay. Moment of truth.

1039
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,125
How will we know if it's worked?

1040
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:10,875
Would you look at that?

1041
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,583
The Locker has been dropped
15,000 feet in the last two minutes.

1042
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:22,666
Still descending.

1043
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,708
Security systems are all down.
I'm locked out.

1044
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:29,791
- How is that even possible? Another hack?
- No. No.

1045
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,083
This is why they did it the first time.

1046
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:34,416
It's been lying dormant
in our system until now.

1047
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,958
- Can you override it?
- I'm trying.

[phone ringing]

1221
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:01,416
Dhawan is back with Parker.
I slipped her a tracker.

1222
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,208
They're heading north. Looping you in now.

1223
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:07,166
[Nomad] Hi, Rachel.

1224
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:10,750
Nice to hear your voice.
I was a bit worried about you.

1225
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:12,875
Were you?

1226
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,250
[device beeps]

1227
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:17,250
Okay, got her.
They're heading towards Iceland.

1228
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,833
I take it I'm no longer compromised.

1229
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:24,666
Well, they have the Heart,
so we're all compromised.

1230
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:28,708
<i>Parker's coming after the Charter,
so we're heading to a secure location.</i>

1231
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:30,166
<i>Clubs is assembling a team.</i>

1232
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:32,916
<i>We'll make sure they're on the ground
by the time you arrive.</i>

1233
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,291
And if we're too late?

1234
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:36,291
Just get there as fast as you can.

1235
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:39,750
If they get the Heart online,
God knows what they're capable of.

1236
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:40,833
I'm on my way.

1237
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:49,208
- [phone disconnects]

[dramatic music playing]

1239
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:16,500
It's not impregnable,
but it's the best we've got.

1240
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:21,291
If the Heart wants to find us, it will.

1241
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:24,833
[sighs]

1242
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:30,000
[Stone]
Will this hunk of junk make it to Iceland?

1243
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,583
Hell yeah.

1244
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:35,625
[serene music playing]

1245
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,958
Nice trick you pulled
with the facial recognition yesterday.

1246
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:49,583
Trying to put a lock on our new toy.

1247
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:52,541
Would you come back for me if I hadn't?

1248
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:54,833
We're a team, Keya.

1249
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:57,375
Don't do it again.

1250
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,458
I think I have it.

1251
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:13,000
I know where they're going.
Reykjavik University computer lab.

1252
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:16,166
It has a cryo-storage facility,
several floors of servers.

1253
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,833
The tracker's heading straight for it.

1254
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:23,541
See, Keya, don't say
I don't keep my promises.

1255
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,666
Okay, be ready.
You know your instructions.

1256
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,541
Couple of minutes,
we'll be up and running.

1257
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:34,416
[beeping]

1258
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,916

[whirring]

1260
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:14,666
Are we up?

1261
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:19,541
We're up.

1262
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:22,833

[motorcycle engine revving]

1264
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:42,875
Is this your naughty list?

1265
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:47,166
Emails, texts, bank accounts. The Heart's
using my algorithm to sort through it all.

1266
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,916
So, we can find anyone?
Gain access to anything?

1267
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Greatest skeleton key in the world.

1268
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:54,583
Show me.

1269
01:29:58,416 --> 01:29:59,750
[screen whirring]

1270
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:01,875
[Keya] There it is.

1271
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:06,166
Evidence of Kharche's years of experiments
on innocents across the country.

1272
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,833
That's the truth... for the world to see.

1273
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:12,750
That's impressive.
But let's see what else this thing can do.

1274
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:14,333
Find me the Kings.

1275
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:17,458
What are you doing?

1276
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:22,833
[woman] Nancy Morrison.
King of Diamonds. Ex-CIA.

1277
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:26,541
The Heart tells us she's heading to
a safe house with her family.

1278
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:28,791
Drop the lift.

1279
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,250
Are you serious?

1280
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:34,458
No. Do...

1281
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:39,708
[tense music crescendos]

1282
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:49,583
[people screaming]

1283
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:50,833
You're welcome.

1284
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:52,750
[man] Hang on. I have another one.

1285
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:56,208
I think you're gonna like this, boss.

1286
01:30:56,708 --> 01:31:00,625
An unidentified military plane landed
at a private airfield 33 minutes ago.

1287
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,583
There.

1288
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:10,125
Jiang Hsu. Served 35 years
in Chinese State Security Service.

1289
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,291
The King of Clubs is here in Iceland.

1290
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:14,083
Even better. Where is he now?

1291
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:17,375
[dramatic music playing]

1292
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:26,833
Two minutes out.

1293
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:29,375
Sending the plans now.
Stone is on her way.

1294
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:31,916
[motorcycle engine revving]

1295
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,708
We don't have time to wait.
Tell her to follow us in.

1296
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:38,916
[tires screeching]

1297
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,375
Any news of Spades or Hearts?

1298
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:42,750
{\an8}[man] Nothing yet.

1299
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:47,833
There were other people in that elevator.
In that lobby.

1300
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:49,958
Calm down, Keya.

1301
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:55,708
You said we were going to expose Kharche
and then the Charter, not murder them.

1302
01:31:55,791 --> 01:32:00,041
The King of Hearts with her team.
They're in a bunker outside of London.

1303
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:02,041
Good.

1304
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,250
Take them out.

1305
01:32:04,583 --> 01:32:05,583
[gasps]

1306
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:09,666
[Clubs] <i>We're approaching now.</i>

1307
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:12,416
<i>- We'll see you on the other side.</i>
- You're going in with them?

1308
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,208
I ordered the strike on Parker.
It's only fair.

1309
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:18,958
You know... I would have made
the same call in Chechnya.

1310
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:20,208
Thanks. The right...

1311
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:21,333
[busy signal]

1312
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:23,166
[electrical sound fades]

1313
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,416
I've lost contact.

1314
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,291
The Heart's online.

1315
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,333
No, no, no, no.

1316
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:35,583
[loud thud]

1317
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,291
We're locked in.

1318
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:48,458
[Jack] Oh God. They've shut off
our ventilation system.

1319
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:50,083
No, no, no, no.

1320
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,750
[panting]

1321
01:32:55,041 --> 01:32:56,583
{\an8}Jack, how long we got?

1322
01:32:56,666 --> 01:32:58,458
[Jack clears throat]

1323
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:02,791
At this rate, about an hour
and we're out of oxygen.

1324
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:04,291
[tense music playing]

1325
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:10,000
The Charter never worries about
who gets in their way. Neither will we.

1326
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:12,833
[woman] King of Hearts is locked in.
They'll be dead in an hour.

1327
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:17,000
- You have to stop this, please.
- Someone has to control this power, Keya.

1328
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:19,000
- Why not us?
- This is not what we agreed.

1329
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:22,333
You're still not seeing
the bigger picture.

1330
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:25,333
This isn't about
some pissy little grievance you had

1331
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:27,208
with the bad man
who killed your mom and dad.

1332
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:29,041
This is about power.

1333
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:34,291
Concentrated in the hands of the few,
of the very few who could use it for good,

1334
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:37,041
who could actually make a change,
but they don't.

1335
01:33:41,541 --> 01:33:45,166
At this moment, we are mining
trillions of pieces of data.

1336
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:48,500
{\an8}In a matter of hours,
I will be able to take down

1337
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:50,458
{\an8}the remaining members of the Charter.

1338
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:55,291
We've been used
and manipulated our whole lives.

1339
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,250
Now it's time for us to take control.

1340
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,333
[tires screeching]

1341
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:13,666

[man] Clubs team are inside
the university building.

1346
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:38,875
What... are you doing?

1347
01:34:40,916 --> 01:34:43,125
You wanna know
how great men get power, Keya?

[alarm 3 sounding]

1349
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,458
<i>It's not because they earn it...</i>

1350
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,625
<i>or because they deserve it.</i>

1351
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:53,416
It is because when the moment comes,

1352
01:34:54,833 --> 01:34:55,833
they take it.

1353
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,250
[tense music crescendos]

1355
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:10,541
Stone is one minute out.

1356
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:13,833
In position. We're all set.

1357
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:20,833

[motorcycle engine revving]

1361
01:35:38,916 --> 01:35:41,041
Stone, you need to get out now.

1362
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,458
<i>I don't have long.</i>

1363
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:43,375
Keya?

1364
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:45,916
I have a failsafe uploading.
It will disable the Heart.

1365
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,916
They won't be able
to access it without me.

1366
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,125
I'm outside. But you already know that.

1367
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:53,458
No, you're not. It's a trap.

1368
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:55,666
<i>I found your tracker.</i>

1369
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:59,083
{\an8}The lab is a decoy.
You need to get your team out now.

1370
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:02,583
- Why should I believe you?
- Because you were right.

1371
01:36:03,083 --> 01:36:06,083
Okay? You told me about Parker,
and you were right about everything.

1372
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:08,708
My parents would have never wanted this.

1373

<i>Just please listen to me.</i>

1374
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:12,791
Get your team out of there right now.

- [Keya] <i>Okay.</i>

1377
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:28,083
I'm sending you my coordinates.
I'll leave the back door open.

1378
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,250
Shit.

Get out of there. It's a trap.
