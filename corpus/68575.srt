1
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:50,158
Let's see if we can get something
out of these guys f or a change.

2
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:59,846
-Warden.
-Scott.

3
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,082
So we were supposed to be
operational three days ago.

4
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:08,845
-We're drilling into 12, 000 feet of ice.
-l know that was the plan.

5
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,887
We've had problems.
Things aren't on schedule.

6
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:15,644
We've been without heat three
of the last six nights.

7
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:18,482
-We're working on it.
-ls what it is.

8
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:23,200
The problem is, we're at 8200 feet,
and we ran into a rock f ormation that--

9
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,157
-lt's just not supposed to be there.
-So drill through it.

10
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,082
lt's not your typical rock f ormation.

11
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:32,843
Seismics is showing us
that it's hollow.

12
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,164
Hollow? Then it should be easy.

13
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,845
Right. So you gotta drill through
a hollow rock. What's the problem?

14
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:47,159
Goodman? The warden wants to know
why we don't drill through the rock.

15
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,245
You wanna explain why we don't?

16
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,168
lt's hollow. lt's hollow.

17
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,162
l heard that.
Why can't we drill through it?

18
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,443
A high-pressure release can
cause head-shearing detonation...

19
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,087
...depending on the consistency of the
gas within the structural f ormation.

20
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:13,887
-lt's a risk.
-l'm willing to take the risk.

21
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,483
So go ahead and drill through it.

22
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,288
l don't think you
understand the risks.

23
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:24,125
l understand. Did you understand me?
l said drill through it.

24
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:27,119
Make the call.

25
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:36,564
All right, put it back online.
Drill through it.

26
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:39,922
l've sat on my ass here
f or over six months.

27
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:20,802
-What is it?
-Pressure f rom inside the rock.

28
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,126
-At least 5000 pounds per square inch.
-Shit.

29
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,527
-What? What's gonna happen?
-We got a lot of gas coming at us.

30
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:34,081
-We'll have an explosion.
-You said nothing about blowing us up!

31
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,123
-l told you exactly--
-Next time, mention all the possibilities!

32
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,807
-What the hell?
-Five seconds to impact.

33
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:59,159
-Chasm was pressurized...
-Jesus!

34
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,362
-...with pure nitrogen.
-ls there gonna be another explosion?

35
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,518
Pure nitrogen.

36
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:12,600
l don't know.

37
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,409
This is strange.
A rock at that depth...

38
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:21,005
...it's gotta be at least
10 million years old.

39
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,167
Anything inside it
probably hasn't aged a day.

40
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:27,366
-Because of the gas?
-Nitrogen is an inert gas.

41
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,839
lt's used at the Smithsonian
to seal old documents.

42
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,240
-Yeah, l know.
-So is there gonna be a problem?

43
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,445
lt's an important find.
We should contact geologists.

44
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:43,079
-You're right.
-l gotta get this prison running.

45
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:46,047
Just get me some power.

46
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:49,161
And make sure me and my boys
get some heat.

47
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,637
-l don't trust these guys.
-Could've got us both killed.

48
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,288
Let's make sure there's
no more screwups.

49
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,328
-The less we see of them, the better.
-Yes, sir.

50
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:39,683
The Antarctic is the last great f rontier
of palaeontological studies.

51
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:43,728
Twenty million years ago,
this was a tropical f orest...

52
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,364
...teeming with reptiles that could be
f ound nowhere else at that time.

53
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:50,848
Yes, Alexandra.

54
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:55,565
Undiscovered reptiles is just
a theory of yours. Correct, doctor?

55
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,205
l mean, it hasn't been proven.

56
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,924
Actually, it's a theory
that we both share.

57
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:05,206
My wife, Dr. Jessica Platt Trenton.

58
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:06,358
Hello.

59
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,407
As you can see,
l'm not alone in this theory.

60
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,129
The scientific community
f rowns on it...

61
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,840
...when the only person who supports
your theories is your wife.

62
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:21,247
We've been granted a research grant
to do some fieldwork...

63
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:24,646
...by the university,
and will no longer be teaching here.

64
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:28,404
We wanted to thank you
and say we've enjoyed our time.

65
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,879
We wish you luck
with all of your f uture endeavours.

66
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,280
-So thank you, and good luck.
-Thank you.

67
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:42,764
-Thanks, professor.
-Thanks.

68
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:50,441
l'm gonna miss you, Dr. Trenton.

69
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:55,958
Even though l may not agree
with all of your theories.

70
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:00,361
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-See you.

71
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,363
She's one of the more attractive
palaeontology students l've seen.

72
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,967
lf l remember, you were the prettiest
palaeontology student l've ever met.

73
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,399
-Really?
-Really.

74
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,966
Why do you think l married you?

75
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,366
Because l got a higher score
on my GMAT than you.

76
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,520
Well, there's that too.

77
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:23,920
That way l could study
off your papers....

78
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,680
You think it's possible
we're making a big mistake?

79
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,999
-Walking out on tenure?
-Yeah.

80
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:36,522
Probably.

81
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:40,447
-So why are we doing it?
-Because--

82
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,758
-Why are we doing it?
-Because l wouldn't f orgive you...

83
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,638
...if you didn't let me do
some serious fieldwork.

84
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,288
l know it's important--

85
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:57,728
-And l'm not ready to settle down yet.
-l'm not asking you to settle--

86
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:03,208
You are. Asking me to have a baby
is asking me to settle down.

87
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:20,438
Yuri.

88
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:26,481
When the Russians learn of our
purchase f rom the North Koreans...

89
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:29,328
...they may take action.

90
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,317
lt's not the Russians l worry about.
lt's the Americans.

91
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,360
Americans?

92
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:42,326
This does not concern them.
They are medium-range missiles.

93
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:48,166
Americans have taken on responsibility
of being the policemen of the world.

94
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:51,765
The Russians have their hands dirty
long enough in our country.

95
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,489
Now it's the Americans' turn.

96
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,804
We have acquired target.

97
00:10:58,969 --> 00:10:59,958
Roger.

98
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:03,439
We are waiting
for authorization to proceed.

99
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,645
Roger.

100
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:13,558
What is it?

101
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:17,642
-Two planes trailing us.
-Ask them to identify themselves.

102
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:23,441
This is Gulf 3-0. Will the planes at 10
miles at my 6:00 identify yourselves.

103
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,680
This is Gulf 3-0. Planes at my 6:00,
again, identify yourselves.

104
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,927
They're not responding.

105
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,042
Target identified and attempted
contact. Please advise.

106
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,201
Roger, Tango 2-8. Go to phase two.

107
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,718
Roger. Proceeding to phase two.

108
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,399
They're closing in on us, sir.

109
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:49,438
-What is it?
-Two planes closing in on us.

110
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,724
Who are they?

111
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,960
l don't know.

112
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,808
The fighters are still closing.

113
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,604
Sir, the fighters are still closing.

114
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:02,045
Countermeasures!

115
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,887
lnstruments are down.

116
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:40,240
Electromagnetic pulse. Blew out all
the electronics. Can you still fly?

117
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:45,085
l have no instruments.
We're totally blind. We have to land.

118
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:54,127
-What do they want, sir?
-They want us to f ollow them.

119
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,086
-Sir?
-What else can we do?

120
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,484
We f ollow them.

121
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:00,480
Diego Garcia.

122
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,562
Largest U.S. military base
in lndian Ocean.

123
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:13,402
What happened?
Where are we landing?

124
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,289
Diego Garcia.

125
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:23,001
Probably our last stop.

126
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:36,118
Welcome to the International
Security Prison Facility.

127
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:40,567
Presently, the temperature outside
is 67 degrees below zero.

128
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,289
We hope you enjoy your stay.

129
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,962
How nice.

130
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:01,922
Mr. Breshcov.

131
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:05,886
l hope your flight here
was pleasant.

132
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:16,679
Mr. Breshcov.

133
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,483
Mr. Breshcov.

134
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,918
Mr. Breshcov.

135
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,597
l hope your flight here
was pleasant.

136
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,488
-Who are you?
-l'm the warden.

137
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,959
l am defence minister of
the sovereign country of Chechnya.

138
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:38,241
By what right do you kidnap me?

139
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:43,199
You haven't been kidnapped, sir. You
have been arrested and sentenced...

140
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:46,998
...to remain in this f acility
f or the rest of your life.

141
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:48,648
For what?

142
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:51,403
For purchasing
two nuclear missiles...

143
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:55,278
...which you were going to launch
at the Russians.

144
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:58,122
Not that it is any of your business...

145
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,406
...but the purchase
of these alleged missiles...

146
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,480
...was to protect my country.

147
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:07,642
The world couldn't aff ord
to find out if you'd use them.

148
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,482
We had to take preemptive action.

149
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:13,607
l claim diplomatic immunity.
l have rights!

150
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,488
You have no rights!

151
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,358
Sir, you are no longer
a citizen of any country.

152
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,679
You're mine!

153
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,886
You have been tried
and convicted...

154
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:30,086
...by an international
protective council.

155
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,887
You're now a member
of an elite prison unit...

156
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,961
...instituted by
a 35-nation committee.

157
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,162
-Warden--
-Shut up!

158
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:42,444
Where are we?

159
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,688
lnternational Maximum Security
Prison, the New Alcatraz.

160
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:49,608
l know this.
But where exactly are we?

161
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,886
Twenty kilometres north
of the South Pole.

162
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,483
Make yourself at home,
Mr. Breshcov.

163
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,644
Sergeant Quinn here.

164
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,488
Okay.

165
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,522
-Warden.
-Yeah.

166
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:15,566
You have a call f rom Puluso.

167
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,606
Lucky me.

168
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,088
Yeah, what is it?

169
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:23,367
I got a problem here. You gotta
come down and see for yourself.

170
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:24,803
Okay.

171
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:28,843
l have never liked surprises.

172
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:32,319
-lt's gonna be another cold night.
-Freezing.

173
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,478
What the hell is this?

174
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:54,159
Well, it's easier to explain
if you see it.

175
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,917
What the hell?

176
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,042
My God.

177
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:08,564
lt should take three jackhammers...

178
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,879
...a week to break through this wall.

179
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,483
l want an immediate
prisoner count.

180
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:15,207
Yes, sir.

181
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:19,078
Sergeant Quinn here.
l need a prisoner count ASAP.

182
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:23,085
-Did you see anything?
-No.

183
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:24,762
All right.

184
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,318
Everyone present and accounted f or.

185
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,720
Good.
So, what the hell happened here?

186
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,284
We don't know.

187
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:36,485
Come on.

188
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,809
Watch it. lt's a little slippery.

189
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:48,366
God!

190
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:50,878
How did this get here?

191
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,487
Puluso, how did this get here?

192
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:57,880
-We don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

193
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,927
We came up here this morning
and it was just here.

194
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,807
lt was just here?

195
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:06,325
lt would take a serious
piece of machinery...

196
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,322
...to drill a tunnel through this ice.

197
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,684
Could be f rom a gas buildup.

198
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,647
Gas buildup? Come on.

199
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:23,607
Give me some light here.

200
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,086
Now what is this thing?

201
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,638
That's the heat ex change pipe...

202
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,643
...we use to tap into
the geothermal source.

203
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:41,166
Are you telling me you didn't cut
this tunnel to the heat ex change?

204
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:44,685
Gas could've been detonated
by the heat ex change...

205
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,647
...blowing a hole through the ice
and wall.

206
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:49,925
You know, Goodman, that is--

207
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:54,682
l don't know.
Maybe you're right.

208
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:57,761
Puluso, what do you think
happened here?

209
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,840
l hope Goodman's right.

210
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,762
You hope he's right.
What else could it be?

211
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,160
Nothing. l'm sure Goodman's right.

212
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:08,604
Some kind of...

213
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,363
...gas explosion.

214
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:13,201
Right.

215
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:16,566
Because l can tell you,
it's not penguins.

216
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:32,080
How deep is this thing?

217
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:34,763
12, 230 feet.

218
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,368
Really?

219
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:40,445
Relax, Goodman.

220
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:02,521
l want you guys to get this wall
sealed back up as soon as possible.

221
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,482
lf it's gas, we should monitor it
f or a few days first.

222
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:09,039
You got two days. This hole is
the only way out.

223
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:12,087
l want guards here
until they seal it up.

224
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:14,205
Yes, sir.

225
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:28,284
Do you think this
was caused by gas?

226
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:31,247
l have no idea.

227
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:36,642
Gas explosion.

228
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,081
l hope you're right, Goodman.

229
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:44,286
Well, what else could it be?

230
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:45,802
l don't know.

231
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,684
What's up?

232
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:04,159
Kelly Mitich.

233
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:07,761
-Yuri Breshcov.
-How you doing?

234
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:10,124
Peter Yuvol.

235
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:13,848
Hey.

236
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,728
So, what are you dudes in f or?

237
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,008
l guess you could say
we are political prisoners.

238
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:23,888
Cool. Sort of like Karl Marx
or something?

239
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,118
Sort of.

240
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:28,998
Yo, maybe you heard of me,
Prince of Darkness.

241
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,844
Twelve countries hired me to hack
the U.S. government.

242
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:37,127
One time l shut down f our
defence networks in one day.

243
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,244
Very good.

244
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:44,403
l'm sorry we did not have opportunity
to utilize your services.

245
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,001
Yeah, me too.

246
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:51,162
So where are the rest
of our fellow prisoners?

247
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,481
There's only six of us. l hear
they're bringing 20 more a month.

248
00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:01,326
ln six months it'll be a goddamn rave,
especially if they're all as hot as her.

249
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:06,802
l'd have lesbian sex with your dead
grandmother bef ore l'd consider you.

250
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:11,367
lsn't she sweet?
Patricia O'Boyle, lRA.

251
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:14,763
She has a little thing f or me.

252
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:17,079
l can tell.

253
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:22,846
How are you doing?

254
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:26,558
As good as can be expected
under the circumstances.

255
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:31,203
l'm sure you dudes
know Jose's work.

256
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,406
The American Embassy
in Buenos Aires.

257
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,724
l think we heard
something about this.

258
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:42,881
And the quiet gentleman
at the table behind us, Ben Shad.

259
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,404
lraqi. Chemical weapons builder.

260
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:49,880
Nice.

261
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,041
So let's get serious.

262
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:57,078
When we gonna bust out?
l know you're thinking about it.

263
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:01,800
You need someone f or the technical
side of the operation. lt's me.

264
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:06,599
Systems analysis, overriding
program systems. l'm your guy.

265
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:10,679
Bust out to where? We're
in middle of South Pole.

266
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:16,879
Couple tycoons like you can get an
ops team in here to rattle this cage.

267
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,647
Kelly.

268
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:21,326
What?

269
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,565
Microphone.

270
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:35,399
Fuck.

271
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,165
Later.

272
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:02,967
What--?

273
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,522
What the hell?

274
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:15,925
l hear something in the tunnel.
l want some backup.

275
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:21,763
Did you hear that?
I need some backup.

276
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:25,483
Jankins, there's nothing there.

277
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:34,324
Did you hear that?
l want some back.

278
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,878
lt's probably the heat ex change.
Check it out.

279
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:44,280
You gotta be kidding.
You want me to go inside?

280
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:48,246
Jankins, get in there
and check it out.

281
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:50,206
That's an order.

282
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:55,522
Goddamn it.

283
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:03,969
Jankins is hearing something in the
ice tunnel. He's calling for backup.

284
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,439
Why don't you and Goodman
go down and help him out.

285
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:14,243
Aw, Jesus....

286
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,245
Isn't there anyone else available?

287
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:22,639
lt's your department.

288
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:26,288
Right.

289
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,088
Did you guys hear that?

290
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,522
Relax.

291
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:52,123
l got Puluso and Goodman
headed there.

292
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:54,484
Great. l'm feeling safer already.

293
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,124
Just the heat ex change pipe.

294
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,285
l told you.

295
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:23,485
Why'd you have me come in here?

296
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:30,365
l wanted to make sure. Want me
to tell them to go back to bed?

297
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:35,080
Fuck them. They can come down here
and f reeze their asses off with me.

298
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:37,240
They're gonna be pissed.

299
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:40,240
So what?

300
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,167
-What was that?
-Say again. l can't hear you.

301
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,684
Say again?

302
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,568
Jankins?

303
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,878
Jankins, do you read me?

304
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:12,927
Jankins, do you read me?

305
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:21,329
Jankins, do you read me?

306
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:25,440
Jankins?

307
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:31,523
Quinn, where's Jankins?

308
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:35,486
He was--
He was in the tunnel.

309
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,640
Get him out here, will you?

310
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:46,080
l lost contact with him.

311
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:50,205
Go into the tunnel
and see what happened to him.

312
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:53,445
l'm not going in the tunnel.

313
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:54,758
Why not?

314
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:57,568
lt's not our job to check out
that tunnel.

315
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,247
lt's part of engineering.

316
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:05,477
Part of engineering? That tunnel
didn't even exist two days ago.

317
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:08,482
Goodman and l are engineers,
not soldiers.

318
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,883
Why don't you send some guards
down here and get Jankins yourself.

319
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:16,483
They're sleeping.

320
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,482
Well, so were we, asshole.

321
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:30,485
He wants us to go in that tunnel
and get Jankins.

322
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:32,765
Jankins is a bitch.

323
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,521
-What?
-What?

324
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,960
Blood?

325
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:02,485
-Hey.
-Hey.

326
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:07,677
We got a letter f rom the university.
They want us to talk to the department.

327
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:09,487
Give them a call.

328
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:12,846
lt's kind of serious.
They want to review our grant.

329
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:23,126
So they take our grant.
We go back to teaching.

330
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,644
-l don't want to.
-lt'll be fine.

331
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,561
-How do you know?
-l don't.

332
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:29,481
-Okay.
-What? What?

333
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:33,198
Just because we don't want
the same things at the same time...

334
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,281
...it doesn't mean l'm not ever
gonna want them.

335
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:39,327
Do you have a timetable
you'd like to share?

336
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:41,719
l'd love to be let in on the secret.

337
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,567
Someday. Just not right now.

338
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:51,968
-l'm sorry.
-Someday.

339
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:56,247
Generally, when you meet someone,
you get married and want kids.

340
00:31:56,449 --> 00:32:01,045
You want me to put my career on hold
while you stomp around the world.

341
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:02,927
You don't have to do that.

342
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,678
Do you think this is the ideal place
to raise a child?

343
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:10,598
-You don't have to stay here.
-l'd be at the motel with our baby.

344
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:14,245
-lt's not gonna work like that.
-How's it gonna work?

345
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:17,287
l don't know.
But we would figure it out.

346
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:19,724
No, l would figure it out!

347
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:22,642
-Dr. and Mrs. Trenton?
-What?

348
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,677
l'm sorry.
Can we help you guys?

349
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:31,445
l would like to talk to you about
a recent discovery in the Antarctic.

350
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,919
-How old is this material?
-72 hours.

351
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:41,366
They were drilling and hit a rock
f ormation that was pure nitrogen?

352
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:42,928
Yes, sir.

353
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:45,319
They want us to go head the team?

354
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:46,968
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:49,241
-Count me in.
-Wait.

356
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:51,320
-Robert!
-Honey, please.

357
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:54,879
Captain, why have my wife and l
been given this honour?

358
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:59,920
There are 20 equally qualified
palaeontologists you could've gone to.

359
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:02,080
You two published a thesis...

360
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:05,764
...on undocumented
Antarctic reptiles.

361
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,840
We're gonna find those here?

362
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:11,678
l don't know. l was ordered
to ask you to join the team.

363
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:15,683
lf you don't want to, l'll ask
Dr. Keener of Berkeley.

364
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:19,046
Come on. He is a hack.
We can't let this slip by.

365
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:22,167
Can you ex cuse us
f or one second, please?

366
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:30,201
What about our grant?
What about our commitment here?

367
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,121
This is a breakthrough.

368
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:36,202
A nitrogen-filled chamber
that's 9000 feet under the ice.

369
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:40,322
lt's a chance to see something
that's 20 million years old.

370
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:44,727
lt's in pristine condition. lt's gonna
look like it was f ormed yesterday.

371
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,367
You're right.

372
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:55,881
l know.

373
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:03,122
So when do we leave?

374
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,405
You're to be on a flight tonight.

375
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,159
-Tonight? Wait a minute.
-Wait. Wait.

376
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:14,921
Joshua?

377
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:17,398
You're in charge.

378
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,481
l guess that's great.

379
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:29,441
-Sit back here?
-Yes.

380
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:20,606
-You all right, doctor?
-Fine, thank you.

381
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:26,681
First time in the Antarctic?

382
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:30,678
My wife and l were here on a dig
in the summer of '97.

383
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:34,683
Not bad in the summer.
But this time of year? Forget it.

384
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:37,158
Months of solid night.

385
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,479
What can you tell me
about this place?

386
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:42,846
-You weren't briefed?
-Barely had time to pack.

387
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:49,039
The captain didn't say a lot. We figured
it's a research or mining operation.

388
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:52,485
Captain Thomas is a little
light in the loafers...

389
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,685
...when giving out inf ormation.

390
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:02,005
Okay, can you be more specific?
l don't get the joke.

391
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:05,407
lnternational high-security prison.

392
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:08,322
They call it New Alcatraz.

393
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:13,478
We're going to a prison
in the middle of the Antarctic?

394
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,122
lnternational prison f or the worst
of the worst.

395
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:24,359
-Never heard of it.
-You won't.

396
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:28,647
Remember that national
security document you signed?

397
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:29,798
Yeah.

398
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:33,763
That means you don't talk about
anything on this mission.

399
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:39,003
We were hired to lead a research team
down to a rock f ormation under the ice.

400
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:40,722
Not this bullshit.

401
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:44,001
l don't know anything
about any rock f ormation.

402
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:49,368
l do know that you and your wife
are supposed to be experts...

403
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:51,281
...on Antarctic reptiles.

404
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:54,486
We're palaeontologists.
We study f ossils.

405
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:59,367
-Fossils?
-Right, f ossils.

406
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:05,602
-Would you tell us what's so f unny?
-How long you been awake?

407
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:10,559
Long enough to hear about the prison.
What do you know that we don't?

408
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,926
l got a report that there was
some sort of...

409
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:18,162
...snakelike creature
running around in the prison.

410
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:22,607
l was told it may have been hiding
in this rock f ormation...

411
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:25,602
...and somebody drilled through it.

412
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:30,289
Alcatraz Approach,
requesting vectors...

413
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,601
...f or our PAR approach to runway
in use. How do you hear me?

414
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:39,449
Alcatraz Approach,
requesting vectors...

415
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:43,158
...f or our PAR approach to runway
in use. Do you hear?

416
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:47,004
And so you brought your soldiers
here to catch the thing?

417
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,962
-lf the need arises.
-So why are we here?

418
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:52,689
We deal with dead things,
not live ones.

419
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:55,079
You're our pros f rom Dover.

420
00:37:55,289 --> 00:38:00,568
A lot of pros f rom Dover got killed
dismantling bombs in World War ll.

421
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:04,881
Take it easy, Dr. Trenton,
Mrs. Trenton, we'll take care of you.

422
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,927
That's Dr. Platt, major.

423
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,317
Right.

424
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:11,520
Prepare f or landing.

425
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,918
l can barely see the wings.
How can they land this thing?

426
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,842
Your guess is as good
as mine, doctor.

427
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,842
Great, thank you.
Very helpf ul.

428
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:32,881
Can't see squat.

429
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,680
Major.

430
00:38:41,649 --> 00:38:44,880
We ain't got no approach lights,
no beacon.

431
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,363
l'm gonna go see.

432
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:52,404
-What's the problem?
-Can't see.

433
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:56,280
We got no approach lights,
no beacon.

434
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:01,483
Do we have f uel to make it
back to the coast?

435
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:03,082
Negative.

436
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:08,602
Well, l don't want to ditch
this plane on some ice field.

437
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:11,044
We have to put her down
somewhere...

438
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:13,359
...because we're flying on f umes.

439
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:15,963
l say we roll the dice
and land the beast.

440
00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:23,561
l guess it'll be anybody's guess
as to where the runway is.

441
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:25,682
Good luck, captain.

442
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,445
Here. Come here.

443
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,679
Hang on.

444
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:55,082
Jesus Christ!

445
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:14,963
Reverse throttles now!

446
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:17,128
Hold on!

447
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:56,485
-Teaching job's looking good now.
-All right, let's get ready to move.

448
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,362
-You okay?
-Yeah.

449
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:11,165
Okay.

450
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:13,365
After we ref uel this beast...

451
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:16,407
...can't be on the ground
more than 12 hours.

452
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:20,608
After that, y'all better plan on
taking the next transport.

453
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,168
Why is that?

454
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:27,323
The fluids on this plane will be
f rozen. l'll be waiting f or it to thaw.

455
00:41:27,649 --> 00:41:29,401
When's the next transport?

456
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:30,968
-30 days.
-30 days?

457
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:32,687
Relax, doctor.

458
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:35,124
We'll get you on the plane.

459
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:38,888
Twelve hours.

460
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:50,761
The main access doors
are about 150 yards.

461
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,758
Make sure you keep the person
in f ront of you in sight.

462
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:58,841
You need a tracker
to find the doors?

463
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,045
lt's August in the Antarctic.

464
00:42:40,649 --> 00:42:42,128
Are we lost?

465
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:44,883
The doors should be here!

466
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:50,762
Then let's go back
to the goddamn plane!

467
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:52,885
Good luck finding it.

468
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:28,046
Now what's the matter?

469
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:29,528
lt's dead.

470
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:36,408
-How are we supposed to get inside?
-McCarthy, get up here.

471
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:38,366
Override this thing.

472
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:08,046
How big is this place?

473
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:12,566
When it's f ully operational, 25, 000
prisoners will be housed here.

474
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:16,443
-How many are here now?
-l don't know.

475
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:20,568
-Where the hell is everybody?
-lnside.

476
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:36,322
-Who else has a key to this place?
-l'm it.

477
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:40,402
What happens
if something happens to you?

478
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:44,162
We're locked in
until somebody lets us out.

479
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:37,007
Jesus!
What the hell happened here?

480
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:43,079
They were shooting at something.

481
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:15,679
-Freeze, or we'll fire!
-Fuck you. You f reeze.

482
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:21,166
All right. Everybody take
a deep breath and listen.

483
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:23,399
Men, stand down.

484
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:26,448
Stand down!

485
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:28,367
This is our rescue team.

486
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:30,088
-We came to help.
-Good.

487
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:31,927
What the hell is going on?

488
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:36,961
-But you are?
-l'm Dr. Robert Trenton.

489
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:39,882
This is my wife,
Dr. Jessica Platt Trenton.

490
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:43,246
-What's going on?
-l'll tell you what's going on.

491
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,923
There's some kind
of oversized snake...

492
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:49,968
...that's killed-- eaten six people.
l say we get on your plane...

493
00:46:50,129 --> 00:46:52,802
-...and fly f ar away f rom here.
-Snake?

494
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:56,684
We came down here
to take care of a problem.

495
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,720
Not to evacuate it.

496
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:00,800
Fuck that. We're out of here.

497
00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:05,366
Let me make myself clear.
No one's going anywhere.

498
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:10,719
l'm the only one with
an access key to get out.

499
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,607
Quinn. Easy, gentlemen.

500
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:21,488
Quinn. lt's okay. Come on.
Don't do this.

501
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:24,209
Stand down. Stand down.

502
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:25,722
Gentlemen.

503
00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:28,606
Trust me, will you?

504
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:33,799
-ls someone going to brief me?
-l'd be glad to.

505
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:37,245
Major Larsten, Warden Ryan.

506
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:41,844
l apologize f or my men.
We've been through hell.

507
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:44,162
Two weeks ago...

508
00:47:45,569 --> 00:47:48,402
...there was a break
in one of our walls.

509
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:53,279
The next night, a guard and
two engineers were killed.

510
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:58,045
Washington told us to seal the
lower part until you guys got here.

511
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,123
Since then, this thing...

512
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:04,201
...has broken our barriers
and killed three more guards.

513
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:06,680
Ex cuse me. This ''thing''?

514
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:09,363
-This is a big, giant snake?
-Big?

515
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,681
That's an understatement.

516
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:18,566
Let me show you.

517
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:25,245
We recorded this...

518
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:27,320
...two nights ago.

519
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:29,408
Holy shit!

520
00:48:29,729 --> 00:48:33,722
That thing's over 80 feet long.
lf it's related to Serpuca Largas...

521
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:37,081
-...it could be the missing link.
-So you're the experts?

522
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:39,922
l guess you could say that.

523
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:43,320
-This is the layout map of the f acility?
-Yeah.

524
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:47,648
-Show me the wall where the hole was.
-Right here.

525
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:50,039
-The heat ex change.
-Yeah, exactly.

526
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:53,440
lf it's a reptile,
it looks f or the warmest place.

527
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:54,598
And f ood.

528
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:58,444
Do you realize this could be the most
significant discovery in history?

529
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:02,124
-This is like a real-life Jurassic Park.
-l saw Jurassic Park.

530
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:06,521
-Everybody got killed.
-Not everybody.

531
00:49:06,729 --> 00:49:09,163
This is not a movie.
l got a prison to run here.

532
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:11,718
Major, l want you
to make me believe...

533
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:15,120
...that you can hunt this thing
down and actually kill it.

534
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:21,081
Yes, sir. So the most logical place to
find this snake is the heat ex change?

535
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,803
lf that's the warmest place,
absolutely.

536
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,247
All right.

537
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:31,959
My men and l will head east
down the access tunnel...

538
00:49:32,129 --> 00:49:35,485
...and we're gonna divide.
McCarthy and Simmons...

539
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:36,923
...you go down west.

540
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:40,479
We'll drive the snake
to the heat ex change and kill it.

541
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:43,959
Okay, wait. ls there no way
to capture this thing?

542
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:46,040
Would you give me a break?

543
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:49,406
This ain't a game reserve.
l got six people dead!

544
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:53,244
l want out of this place too,
but we can't abandon ship.

545
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:56,048
You must understand
the significance of this find.

546
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:59,963
Doctor, when it's dead,
it's all yours.

547
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:02,768
Meanwhile, major,
let's put this operation in gear.

548
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:04,928
Yes, sir.

549
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:06,721
Let's go!

550
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,762
-What is this place?
-Security control room.

551
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:21,443
One man can watch
the entire f acility.

552
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:33,123
We're moving down the east tunnel.
Nothing so far.

553
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:39,564
You'll reach the divide
in the tunnel...

554
00:50:39,729 --> 00:50:41,879
...in about 20 meters.

555
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:52,881
McCarthy, Simmons,
move down the west tunnel.

556
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:27,922
Sir.

557
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:31,602
We're at the end. lt's all clear.

558
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:34,084
You guys should be
at another intersection.

559
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:36,359
McCarthy, left.
Simmons, right.

560
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:40,528
Sir, are you telling us
to proceed by ourselves?

561
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:42,122
Damn it, McCarthy!

562
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:43,682
Keep moving!

563
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:46,888
All right.

564
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:49,442
Let's go.

565
00:52:16,769 --> 00:52:20,648
Sir, l think l hear something
directly ahead of me.

566
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:23,118
Make sure you have a target
bef ore you fire.

567
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:25,757
This place is loaded with
exposed gas lines.

568
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:40,637
Sir, l saw it. l just saw it.
lt's headed down S-23.

569
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:42,362
Repeat. What access way?

570
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:46,443
-Repeat. What access way?
-Lost the target.

571
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,725
-l'm moving back.
-Damn it, McCarthy! Keep moving!

572
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:54,478
Keep moving. Damn it, McCarthy.
Keep moving.

573
00:53:49,049 --> 00:53:52,280
-What's on surveillance?
-l don't see a thing.

574
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:55,168
Work with me.
You've got to see something.

575
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:58,284
There is nothing on the screen.

576
00:53:58,529 --> 00:53:59,882
All right, hold it.

577
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:06,605
Warden, how many guards
do you have?

578
00:54:07,689 --> 00:54:09,441
-We have six.
-All right.

579
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,247
I need them to move east
up the main corridor.

580
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:17,845
-What the hell f or, major?
-l need help down here!

581
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:19,965
Just do as l say!

582
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:22,689
This thing...

583
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:25,568
...has already killed
three of my men.

584
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,845
This isn't my problem.

585
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:32,918
lf we want to get out alive,
it's a problem f or all of us.

586
00:54:33,129 --> 00:54:35,689
This is bullshit, Fred,
and you know it!

587
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:40,443
They should have
just evacuated us.

588
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:43,282
They were sent
to deal with this thing.

589
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:46,247
My men are guards...

590
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:48,081
...not big-game hunters.

591
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:53,599
Mr. Quinn, my friend, you and I
have been through a lot together.

592
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:56,841
Now, I want you to get your men...

593
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:59,284
...and go down there, understand?

594
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:03,206
This is a direct order.

595
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:05,929
And what are you gonna do if l don't?

596
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:08,645
l'm gonna fire you.

597
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,240
And replace me with who?

598
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:17,568
First real son of a bitch
l can find.

599
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:28,244
This is Sergeant Quinn.

600
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:33,529
l need all guards to meet me at the
access way to the lower south entrance.

601
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:35,839
l'm going with you.

602
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:38,120
Welcome to the party.

603
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:42,964
Doctor, you were sent here
as an expert, not a soldier.

604
00:55:43,129 --> 00:55:44,926
l'm not doing anything here.

605
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:57,045
-Where are you going?
-With you.

606
00:55:57,209 --> 00:56:00,599
-No, you're not.
-This is really important to me.

607
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:04,079
-Jessica, no.
-l am going with you.

608
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:11,878
Simmons, where are you?

609
00:56:13,649 --> 00:56:15,128
Keep your eyes open.

610
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:31,722
Major, it's coming
straight f or you.

611
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:35,683
-How f ar?
-100 meters and closing fast.

612
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:37,248
Simmons, where are you?

613
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:41,887
Major, here it comes. You should
open fire now. Open fire now!

614
00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:45,161
-l would open fire now!
-l don't see anything.

615
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:48,646
You don't see anything?
lt's in f ront of you!

616
00:56:57,529 --> 00:57:00,965
Cease fire! Cease fire!

617
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:37,561
Goddamn it.
We've got a man down.

618
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:40,402
-What happened?
-He's been shot.

619
00:57:42,969 --> 00:57:46,041
Major, wait f or Quinn
and his men to get there.

620
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:48,967
Shit!

621
00:57:49,689 --> 00:57:51,645
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

622
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:53,765
What?

623
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:59,206
We should continue on f oot
f rom here on out.

624
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:03,157
What f or? l'm not walking
with that snake on the loose.

625
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,366
-l want to get in and out.
-Snakes can't hear.

626
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:08,963
They don't hear.
They sense vibration.

627
00:58:09,129 --> 00:58:12,326
-These carts create vibration.
-So what?

628
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:17,404
-He's right. They attract it.
-Come on. You gotta be kidding me.

629
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:21,164
-l'm serious. We shouldn't use carts.
-We're not walking.

630
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:23,081
Any of you wanna walk?

631
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,080
l didn't think so.

632
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:28,520
You may be the expert, doc,
but no one's walking.

633
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:33,320
-Now, get back in the car.
-No. No way.

634
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:38,563
Enjoy the walk, asshole.

635
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:35,680
Come on, you son of a bitch!

636
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:42,566
We got a major gas leak.
Tell your men to pull back!

637
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:45,038
Quinn, you heard the major.

638
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:48,165
Get back out of there.

639
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:53,038
Quinn, did you hear that?

640
00:59:53,569 --> 00:59:55,924
-Quinn?
-Major!

641
01:00:05,129 --> 01:00:06,847
What was that?

642
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:12,280
Quinn? Major!

643
01:00:13,649 --> 01:00:14,968
Come in.

644
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:22,647
Quinn, can you hear me?

645
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:25,518
Shit.

646
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:29,841
Jesus Christ!

647
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:35,843
-Shit!
-What?

648
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:40,161
We gotta get out of here.
The heat, the flames!

649
01:00:43,529 --> 01:00:46,168
-Oh, my God!
-Unbelievable.

650
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:50,163
-l have to document this.
-Don't do anything to aggravate it.

651
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:53,884
lt's the greatest discovery in history.
You don't want a picture?

652
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:55,926
l just don't want to die.

653
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:58,481
Gonna run f or it on three.

654
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:01,487
Ready, one, two...

655
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:05,446
...three!

656
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:09,926
Go!

657
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:16,881
-l can't!
-l'll get it.

658
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:26,968
Take my hand.

659
01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:32,198
Jessica! Jessica!

660
01:01:35,689 --> 01:01:37,884
Jessica! Jessica!

661
01:02:04,249 --> 01:02:06,365
-What are you doing?
-You're alive.

662
01:02:06,529 --> 01:02:10,204
-My wife is dead.
-What about Quinn? The major?

663
01:02:10,369 --> 01:02:12,837
-Everyone is dead.
-Shit!

664
01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:14,767
Where are the others?

665
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:16,567
-What others?
-Prisoners.

666
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:18,805
-ln their cells.
-Let's get them.

667
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,846
-What?
-Let's get them.

668
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:22,965
Let's get them? Why?

669
01:02:23,129 --> 01:02:27,486
With their help, we escape. The
plane leaves in under f our hours.

670
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:30,447
We'll leave, but
we're not taking prisoners.

671
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:33,966
-They're killers.
-lt's not a moral question.

672
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:37,360
lt's simple f ucking math!
lt's simple mathematics.

673
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:39,605
-Hold on!
-lt's not a moral issue.

674
01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:44,599
lt's mathematics. With the prisoners'
help our chances of survival go up.

675
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:46,600
Do you get that?

676
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:48,566
Do you get that?

677
01:02:55,529 --> 01:03:01,081
That is if they don't kill us first.
Do you understand that?

678
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:06,877
All right, here they are.

679
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:11,166
Do you know what's going on
with the loose snake?

680
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,889
We're all stuck
inside here right now.

681
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:18,318
-We need your help to escape.
-You need our help to escape?

682
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:19,917
That's right.

683
01:03:22,729 --> 01:03:27,200
-l'm not opening these cells.
-l'm not here f or a violent crime.

684
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:29,969
-We can work out a deal.
-Shut up.

685
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:32,842
-Always the tough lrish whore, huh?
-lf we help...

686
01:03:33,049 --> 01:03:36,644
-...we go f ree?
-He doesn't have power to grant that.

687
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:40,728
He's right. l don't have that power,
but l'll tell you what.

688
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:44,802
You got a better chance escaping
once you're outside than you do now.

689
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:49,287
You have a deal.

690
01:03:51,649 --> 01:03:54,038
-Let them out.
-What's the point?

691
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:56,279
We're all trapped in this prison.

692
01:03:56,449 --> 01:04:01,967
They know more about breaking out
of prison than we do. Come on.

693
01:04:15,729 --> 01:04:19,608
Mr. Breshcov, l'm going to ask you
f or your word of honour...

694
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:25,844
-...that if l do this thing--
-l give you my word.

695
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:28,045
You will not be harmed.

696
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:51,128
l want to make
one thing perfectly clear...

697
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:53,325
...right f rom the top--

698
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:58,842
l said, no one is to be harmed.

699
01:04:59,049 --> 01:05:02,166
-We need weapons.
-No. l'm not giving you weapon--

700
01:05:04,169 --> 01:05:06,444
So now we need weapons.

701
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:11,167
These weapons are live,
so watch out--

702
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:21,042
Let's go, guys. Come on.
Move, move. Come on, boys.

703
01:05:23,449 --> 01:05:26,088
-You need a gun?
-No. Right up here.

704
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,722
All right!

705
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:32,803
l say dynamite the outer wall,
then dig.

706
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:36,962
-The walls are 2 feet thick.
-l can override the mainf rame.

707
01:05:37,129 --> 01:05:41,168
-Tell the access doors the power's on.
-The lock can't be overridden.

708
01:05:41,329 --> 01:05:43,081
-No shit.
-Nice idea, though.

709
01:05:43,289 --> 01:05:46,361
Wait. Snake breaks in through
heat ex change.

710
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:49,447
lce tunnel intersects
heat ex change pipe.

711
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:53,767
We go through break in ice tunnel
and climb out heat tunnel.

712
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:56,443
Runs a few feet below the ice
at the top.

713
01:05:56,649 --> 01:05:58,879
Small charge,
blow through to surf ace.

714
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:00,522
How do you know that?

715
01:06:00,689 --> 01:06:04,204
Some of us were not considering
spending rest of our lives here.

716
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:07,918
Good idea, but there's a flaw.
The heat ex change room...

717
01:06:08,129 --> 01:06:10,199
...has two ways to get there...

718
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:13,918
...the main access tunnel
or through the chamber room.

719
01:06:14,089 --> 01:06:19,402
The snake's been in both areas. lf it's
not in one, it's in the heat ex change.

720
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:21,844
-We divide in groups.
-Then we cut power in half.

721
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:26,361
This is not about power. The snake
can't be in two places at once.

722
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:29,965
-Both groups have 50-50 chance.
-lf it's in the heat ex change?

723
01:06:30,249 --> 01:06:31,568
Then we're all dead.

724
01:06:31,729 --> 01:06:35,244
That too complicated f or you,
you wild, Protestant whore?

725
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:37,641
Come on! Come on, baby!

726
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,321
-We won't get anywhere by fighting.
-Then let me kill him.

727
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:44,320
-We'll have a truce.
-No fights.

728
01:06:44,489 --> 01:06:47,367
l'm the one in charge here.
Don't f orget.

729
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:51,318
You were in charge
until all your guards got whacked!

730
01:06:51,489 --> 01:06:54,526
Want to take a vote
on who's in charge?

731
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:56,839
Any one of us could kill you...

732
01:06:57,089 --> 01:06:58,761
...with his bare hands.

733
01:06:59,009 --> 01:07:01,648
Good. Now, this is understood.

734
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,687
Warden, Mitich, O'Boyle,
go with Dr. Trenton.

735
01:07:04,849 --> 01:07:08,285
-The rest come with me.
-You're sticking them together?

736
01:07:08,449 --> 01:07:12,283
They're trying to kill each other.
They won't kill you.

737
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:27,886
-Hope you can shoot that gun.
-What do you expect?

738
01:07:28,049 --> 01:07:32,042
-l'm not here f or killing anybody.
-Worse. You shut down AOL.

739
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:36,883
-What is it?
-Thought l heard something.

740
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:43,845
Did you see something?
Come on.

741
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:46,159
-We're all clear.
-So are we.

742
01:07:56,729 --> 01:07:59,641
Ben! Where the hell did he go?

743
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:03,564
What do you mean, he's gone?
He left?

744
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:05,959
Quit whining.
Just shut your mouth.

745
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:09,121
-Shut up, you lRA bitch.
-l've waited f or this...

746
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:11,120
...since l laid eyes on you!

747
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:14,042
-Knock it off.
-Not until l shoot the bastard!

748
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:17,679
l've been waiting f or this since
l laid eyes on you!

749
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:23,801
Mitich!

750
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:31,725
How you like them apples,
Patty?

751
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:36,399
Knock it off! Jesus Christ!

752
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:38,560
Get out of the car!

753
01:08:38,809 --> 01:08:42,768
-Are you happy, doctor?
-What the hell's wrong with you?

754
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:46,399
l told you, not until
l shoot the little bastard.

755
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:53,798
Goddamn it, Mitich!

756
01:09:00,889 --> 01:09:04,677
l ref use to get killed down here
in this hellhole, Mitich!

757
01:09:46,689 --> 01:09:48,520
Let's get out of here.

758
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:51,802
Okay.

759
01:10:11,089 --> 01:10:14,604
Yuri, come in. Come in.

760
01:10:14,769 --> 01:10:17,203
Patty and I
are the only ones left.

761
01:10:17,369 --> 01:10:19,325
-I repeat--
-Where are you?

762
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:22,128
Patty and I
are the only ones left.

763
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,723
-Everyone else--
-What happened?

764
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:27,722
We're too f ar underground
to get transmission.

765
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:29,720
What is this place?

766
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:33,920
Blueprints l stole say
it was used f or storage.

767
01:10:34,089 --> 01:10:36,159
Storage f or what?

768
01:10:36,329 --> 01:10:38,684
Water, f uel, f ood.

769
01:10:40,329 --> 01:10:43,639
The only f ood l see in here now
is us.

770
01:10:55,489 --> 01:10:56,842
Go!

771
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:02,837
Go. Go!

772
01:11:38,769 --> 01:11:41,727
-Who are you?
-Jessica Platt....

773
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:45,159
Your husband said you were killed.

774
01:11:46,529 --> 01:11:48,759
lt's Dr. Trenton's wife.

775
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:55,645
Follow me.

776
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:06,477
l thought you were dead.

777
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:09,447
My husband.
Where's my husband?

778
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:11,440
He's with the other group.

779
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:13,361
How did you get here?

780
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,487
This-- This snake,
it chased-- chased me...

781
01:12:16,649 --> 01:12:18,401
...through the air shaft.

782
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:20,127
l crawled....

783
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:23,323
Cover me. Then come.

784
01:12:40,049 --> 01:12:42,688
There's no way in hell
l'm going through there.

785
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:47,081
We don't have a choice. Plane leaves
in an hour. We have to go.

786
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:49,968
No, we'll backtrack,
find another way.

787
01:12:50,129 --> 01:12:52,484
We don't have time.
We have to get on the plane.

788
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:57,040
There are no snakes in lreland,
not one on the whole goddamn island.

789
01:12:57,209 --> 01:13:01,202
-So what?
-So what? They're evil creatures.

790
01:13:01,369 --> 01:13:04,486
Look, l need you
to promise me one thing.

791
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:06,480
Fine. What?

792
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:10,358
You gotta promise me that no
goddamn snake does away with me.

793
01:13:11,249 --> 01:13:14,446
Fine. But l guarantee you,
if we stay here...

794
01:13:14,609 --> 01:13:18,397
...we are definitely gonna die,
snake or no snake.

795
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:20,400
Okay?

796
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:21,888
Okay.

797
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:25,402
Okay.

798
01:13:57,449 --> 01:13:59,485
Do you see it?

799
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:01,488
No.

800
01:14:22,689 --> 01:14:25,601
Peter!

801
01:14:33,209 --> 01:14:35,165
Stop! Come on!

802
01:14:35,729 --> 01:14:37,082
Come on!

803
01:15:11,689 --> 01:15:13,680
We have to wait f or Robert.

804
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:16,682
First we get to the plane.
Then l come back f or him.

805
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:18,601
No, you won't.

806
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:20,805
Listen to me.
We have to move.

807
01:15:28,049 --> 01:15:31,121
-We can't leave him behind.
-Trust me.

808
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:33,366
l will come back f or him.

809
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,360
Now, let's move.

810
01:15:59,409 --> 01:16:00,808
Here.

811
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:09,598
Here. Come on.

812
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:26,562
Come on.

813
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:01,762
Oh, God.

814
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:06,600
Where is the plane?

815
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:09,920
-l have absolutely no idea.
-Let's go this way!

816
01:17:49,329 --> 01:17:51,126
Come on.

817
01:17:51,529 --> 01:17:53,406
You all right?

818
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:11,728
You all right?

819
01:18:28,969 --> 01:18:30,687
Help me!

820
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:33,964
-Come here!
-God, help, please!

821
01:18:34,129 --> 01:18:35,721
Help me! God!

822
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:38,644
Help me!

823
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:41,007
Please help me!

824
01:18:41,409 --> 01:18:43,400
Oh, God! Help me!

825
01:18:44,049 --> 01:18:46,961
Please, no!

826
01:18:48,409 --> 01:18:50,240
Help me, please!

827
01:18:50,409 --> 01:18:52,081
Please help me!

828
01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:55,164
Help me, f or f uck's sake!

829
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:10,198
Goddamn it!

830
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:02,359
Robert, Robert, get up.
Come on. Get up.

831
01:20:11,769 --> 01:20:17,082
Open the door!
Come on, open the door!

832
01:20:30,609 --> 01:20:32,884
What happened to you?

833
01:20:33,569 --> 01:20:35,525
-Are you all right?
-l'm fine.

834
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:37,407
Are you hurt?

835
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:42,442
No. What happened to you?

836
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:47,844
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

837
01:20:50,529 --> 01:20:55,000
She reminds me of my wife.
Very tenacious.

838
01:20:55,169 --> 01:20:58,286
Know what? Maybe now you'll
get a chance to see her again.

839
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:04,999
No. She died in the war.

840
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,447
l'm sorry.

841
01:22:04,009 --> 01:22:07,399
Okay, let's get this baby started.

842
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:11,238
Let me check this.

843
01:22:46,889 --> 01:22:48,607
What the hell?

844
01:22:48,769 --> 01:22:51,283
-What was that?
-lt's flying heavy.

845
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:54,998
-Yeah, l noticed.
-Maybe there's ice in the cargo area.

846
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:58,243
l checked it bef ore we left.

847
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:03,841
You guys better strap in tight!
We're in f or rough chops ahead.

848
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:24,286
What the hell was that?

849
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:28,447
What, what?

850
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:46,003
Look out, look out.
Go, go, go.

851
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:04,126
Oh, shit.

852
01:24:13,169 --> 01:24:14,488
