1
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,540
- [Sultan humming]

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,620
Help! I've struck oil!

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,400
- Sultan, what should I do?

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,060
- What would anyone do when their bath water turns glue? Get me the Mario Brothers!

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,020
- Well, as long as these camels keep their big mouths shut-

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,680
- We should be A-okay.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,920
- Yeah, but where'd the oil come from?

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,820
- My palace is built over an oil well.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,440
But somehow, the oil pipes leading up from my well must have gotten crossed with the water pipes from the oasis.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,140
- In that case, Your Royal Sultiness, we gotta re-plumb your plumbing before the oil pressure builds, and your palace blows sky high!

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,700
- CHEATSY! Help me!

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,220
These yucky pipes won't stay switched!

13
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,600
I told you this was no job for a beauty queen.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,820
- Tell that to the Mario Brothers, Kootie Pie. They'll be here any second.

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,260
- Daddy, do something!

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,260
We're about to be infested by those pesky plumbers.

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,020
- I hear your whining loud and clear, my darling detestable daughter.

18
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,340
The doomship's fuel tanks are nearly filled, and you can't let the Mario Brothers discover that we're stealing the Sultan's oil...

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,200
... through his water pipes until we've drained his oil well dry. So, stop the Mario Brothers. That's an order!

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:51,440
- Ooh, sometimes he just gets so bossy I could spit in his soup! "Stop the Mario Brothers". How?

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,020
- Relax sis, I've got a scheme so sneaky that Dad'll wish he thought of it.

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,600
- Oh.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,680
[shrieks] What happened to my usual beautiful self?

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,660
- I turned you into Mario's dream girl. It's the perfect way to stall him.

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,620
Sorry sis, I gotta split!

26
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,660
- Cheatsy, hold it, you get back here! You forgot to do my tail.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,780
- Woah!

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,360
- Well, hello handsome. Aren't you the famous Super Mario?

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,280
- A super guess, my super beautiful lady.

30
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:53,640
- Pleased to meet you. I am Lady Fettuccine Alfredo. A little bit saucy, but very, very nice.

31
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,780
- Hey, uh, I don't wanna be rude, but wasn't that a tail I just saw?

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,840
- A tail? Me? Why I have never been so insulted in all my life!

33
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,780
Here I am, lost in these dungeons for days without a thing to eat, and now you are accusing me of having a tail?

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,740
- Woah! Oof!

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,080
- [chuckles] Please forgive my little brother for being so rude. Perhaps you'd like a gourmet snack?

36
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,920
- You know Mario sweetie, I'm an amateur plumber myself.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,560
- Her, a plumber? Hm. Hey, speaking of plumbing, Mario, we got a job to do.

38
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,300
- Luigi's right.

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,820
And now that we've eaten, I think you should bring the Sultan and all his guests down here,

40
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,340
Where they'll be safe in case the, uh, castle explodes. [laughs]

41
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,100
- Isn't she wonderful, Luigi? Always lookin' out for other people?

42
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,580
Lady Fettuccine says this is the safest place to be.

43
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,100
- You'd take the word of an amateur plumber?

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,320
- Who's dress doesn't even match her tail?

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,060
Huh?

46
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,680
- Maybe not, but it certainly matches the rest of me.

47
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,699
CHEATSY! Restore me to my natural loveliness!

48
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,400
- [gasps] You mean I fell for Kootie Pie Koopa?

49
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:39,500
[both screaming]

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,180
- Congratulations, my dastardly descendants. I have seldom seen badness done better.

51
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,920
And as for you, you fun spoiling goody-goodies, you're finally my Koopa captives!

52
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,660
Sultan, I'll be upstairs gloating while the doomship sucks your oil well dry! [laughs]

53
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,800
- Come on, Luigi! We gotta put a clog in Koopa's plans!

54
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
- You'll never see the Mario Brothers again.

55
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,380
- Just watch this.

56
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,980
I dare you to come over here and say that.

57
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,740
- The Mario Brothers are finished!

58
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,160
- You wanna bet?

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,700
- I think it's time Lady Fettuccine met her dream reptile.

60
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,700
Casanova Koopa!

61
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,980
- But Mario!

62
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,120
- Eh, wrong voice.

63
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,860
- But Mario, what am I supposed to do?

64
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,060
- Sweep Kootie Pie off her feet, while I take care of plumbing matters upstairs.

65
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,300
- Wh- Who...

66
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,160
Are you?

67
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,720
- My friends call me Casanova Koopa...

68
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,680
[sighs]

69
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,720
- But you can call me Sweet Lips.

70
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,540
- Wow, you've got some kiss up.

71
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,120
- Yeah, who is this guy anyway?

72
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:45,180
- Kootie Pie, can we get some privacy? What do you say we clear out the riffraff and redecorate in here?

73
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,560
- You get out of here and leave us in peace!

74
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,780
[Toad screams]

75
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,520
- I'm not sure King Dad would like this.

76
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,460
- Daddy only wants me to be happy.

77
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,100
And believe me Cheatsy, Casanova's the only reptile for me.

78
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,260
- LUIGI!

79
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
- Luigi?

80
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,280
[shrieks]

81
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,680
- I've been kissed by a plumber!

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,740
I'll tie your lips behind your head!

83
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,180
And you'll never kiss again!

84
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,760
- We're all set. Princess, when I give the signal, turn the wheel.

85
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,300
- Woah! The Koopa kids are right behind me!

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,520
- Luigi, this way!

87
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
- Princess, now!

88
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,520
(Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and hidin', been told a long time ago!)

89
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,820
(Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and hidin', been told a long time ago!)

90
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,600
(I've been told, baby you've been bold, I won't be your fool no more...)

91
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,500
(Oh Malinda, she's a solid sender, you know you better surrender...)

92
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,800
(Oh Malinda, she's a solid sender, you know you better surrender...)

93
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,100
(Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and hidin', won't be your fool no more...)

94
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,420
(Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and hidin', won't be your fool no more...)

95
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,599
- I need the doomship!

96
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,699
[all screaming]

97
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,040
- Kootie Pie! Cheatsy! Follow me!

98
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,980
Now they'll see the true creepiness of the Koopa clan!

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,700
[laughs]

100
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,880
- Mario! Luigi! You must stop King Koopa before my palace is destroyed!

101
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,660
- We've only got one chance.

102
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,860
Let 'er rip, Luigi!

103
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,940
Ya hee!

104
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,820
Yaaah! Woah!

105
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,240
- Yee-haw!

106
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,100
- Doomship, here I come.

107
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
- Ride them, plumber boy!

108
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,000
- Yee-haw!

109
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,800
[all gasping and sputtering]

110
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,780
- Let's Koop outta here!

111
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,440
[all cheering]

112
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,600
- Thank you, thank you.

113
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,380
- But what are we going to do about my palace? It's ruined!

114
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,640
- Hey, since the Koopas left their wand behind, we might as well give it a shot.

115
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,460
Oh no, the wand's melted!

116
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,620
- But my palace is perfect!

117
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,460
- In that case, I've got first dibs on the jacuzzi!

118
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,700
- Oh no you don't! I fixed it.

119
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,020
- Well I rode it!

120
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,400
Well I had to kiss Kootie Pie!

121
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,780
[both laugh]
