1
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,557
Sometimes, life is so perfect.

2
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,218
Isn't it?

3
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,889
It has to be. To make up for all
the hard stuff it throws your way.

4
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,162
You have to learn to walk.

5
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,865
You have to learn to talk.

6
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,099
You have to wear

7
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,339
that totally ridiculous hat
your grandma bought you.

8
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,804
You have no say in the matter.

9
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,783
And when you're a little older,
even though you get to choose your hats,

10
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,345
you don't get to choose what they put
in those meatballs at the cafeteria.

11
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,747
Or when to fall in love.

12
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,998
Things happen,
and you just have to deal.

13
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,333
And breathe.

14
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,544
Let's just think of the day
my parent's divorce came through

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,605
as 'Big, Ugly Hat Day. '

16
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,186
Refer to diagram B
on page 19.

17
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,012
'The Tree of Life. '

18
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,518
And breathe.

19
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,825
Anybody but his own
selfish pleasure.

20
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,592
Mom, please.
- Focus.

21
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,692
I couldn't care less about
your father's midlife crisis

22
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,602
and complete mockery
of his wedding vows.

23
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,371
I just hope he doesn't
expect me to take...

24
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,707
Halley, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

25
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,939
Guys...
- Where do you think you're going?

26
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,211
As long as you're gonna kill me
with flying ice, does it matter?

27
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,751
Excuse me, everyone. L...

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,979
Mom?
- Sorry.

29
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,851
I have some really
important news to announce here.

30
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,915
Lewis and l...
we're getting married.

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,325
He asked me last Saturday night.

32
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,555
I wanted to tell you,

33
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,088
but I wasn't sure when,
or how you'd react.

34
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,830
I told him I couldn't even wear
this ring until after I talked to you.

35
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,964
But we wanna have
this big Spring wedding.

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,530
Mom, I'm so happy.

37
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,817
Nice timing, huh?

38
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,480
Tell your mom you're getting married
on the day she gets divorced.

39
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,891
Why does love
make people crazy?

40
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,902
Scarlett, you weren't picking up
your phone. I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,403
Halley, that's Michael. Michael...

42
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,838
Hi.

43
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,741
Thank you.

44
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,982
Bye! I love you!

45
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,854
What do you think?

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,625
You didn't tell me
you were doing it.

47
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,298
When you meet the right person
and you fall in love...

48
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,441
It's like... it's like
everything you thought...

49
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,346
you thought is...

50
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,645
Can you believe it?

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,654
No. I can't.

52
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,656
Scarlett, come on.

53
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,320
You are sounding dangerously close
to a Hallmark greeting card.

54
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,161
You're gonna let yourself turn
into mush over something like sex?

55
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,156
Yeah.

56
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,427
You can't expect
to do anything great in life

57
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,236
if you buckle the first time
some guy bats his eyes at you.

58
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,901
News flash, Hal.

59
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,707
Even Madonna
eventually got married.

60
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,414
My mom thinks that means
there's hope for her, too.

61
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,919
Your mom wants to get married?

62
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,489
Well, she wants
to fall in love, Halley.

63
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,425
Everyone does.

64
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,987
Hi. I've been in...

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,164
Hi. I've been divorced
for a long time,

66
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,171
so my baggage is ancient history.

67
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,302
I like to think
that I travel light these days.

68
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:14,710
Except for my daughter, Scarlett,
who is just a joy of a carryon.

69
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,307
I think I'm taking
the baggage thing too far.

70
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,619
Maybe I should start over.

71
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,851
You know what I think
of this whole idea.

72
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,155
I'm only gonna send it
to the online guys

73
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:33,062
who pass my rigid
five-point checklist.

74
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,531
Here, you try.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,090
Go away.
- Lydia.

76
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,764
The man of your dreams
is sitting out there right now

77
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,636
waiting to hear from you.

78
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,697
Speak to him.

79
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,108
I don't think the perfect man
is gonna want to hear what I have to say.

80
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,374
Sure he does, Sweetie.
Speak to him.

81
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,338
Go on.

82
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,421
I'm sorry, Mr. Perfect...

83
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,391
but if you're waiting for me,
it's gonna be a hell of a long wait.

84
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,123
See, I've had it
with men like you.

85
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,759
I think it's terrific
that you have a great job,

86
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,462
and you're sensitive
to the needs of others,

87
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,768
and you jog three times a week
to keep the belly at bay.

88
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,900
But the second
some silicon-breasted,

89
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,003
butt-kissing, airhead climber
half your age comes along,

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,980
you can't keep
your pants zipped.

91
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,107
Well, fuck you!

92
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,946
That's right, Mr. Middle-age,

93
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,418
think-you're-a-big-shot,
phony asshole.

94
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,649
You ain't gettin' any from me.

95
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,181
Okay.

96
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,088
I think we'll just
give this a little time.

97
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,394
So juvenile.

98
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,243
I'm glad you're back early from camp,

99
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,508
even though it was
a dishonorable discharge.

100
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,415
What happened? Where were
you trying to get to in that canoe?

101
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,474
No comment.

102
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,109
No comment?

103
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,616
I don't speak to the press.

104
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,216
I'm the press?

105
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,251
Yeah, and anything I say can
and will be used against me, right?

106
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,388
I would never use
anything against you.

107
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,697
Dad, give it up! It's old,
and you need to get your own material.

108
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,703
Daddy Dog.
- Yo.

109
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,231
Len Martin. It's you, right?
WDYG's coolest DJ.

110
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,298
That's me.

111
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,308
'We dig the dog! '

112
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,504
Love your show, man.
- Thanks, man.

113
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,184
You are the hippest
old guy I know.

114
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,949
Yo, dude!
I'm not that old!

115
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,585
That's Len Martin.

116
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,393
Hello, gorgeous ones.

117
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,598
And you invited her.

118
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,233
Hey, Baby.
- Hey.

119
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,801
I thought we'd spend time together,
then we could have a chance to bond.

120
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,542
Well... Look at you, Halley.

121
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,578
That's hard to do
without a mirror, isn't it?

122
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,291
Honey, you keep getting
prettier every day.

123
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,057
I have no idea how you
could say that, cause...

124
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,928
you definitely don't
see me every day, do you?

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,730
And yesterday,
my God, I was so ugly,

126
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,862
and last Wednesday...
that sucked, too.

127
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,600
So it's kind of
a day-to-day thing.

128
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,471
I love that sense of humor.

129
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,909
Just like her daddy.

130
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,144
Look at that gorgeous girl.
- Dad, stop it.

131
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,881
She's got her daddy's hair.

132
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,547
Don't cut it.
- It's beautiful.

133
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,991
Don't cut it.
Just let it grow, let it grow.

134
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,391
Don't cut it.

135
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,451
Cut it.

136
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,253
Okay.

137
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,399
Let me count the ways
that this card can be used to induce...

138
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,568
nausea,
gastric distress, vomiting.

139
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,810
Yeah, go ahead and mock me,
but this is serious.

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,849
I need to find something funny
and something sweet...

141
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,248
just the way Scarlett is.

142
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,481
Remember last time I got her...
- Okay. Look, here's one.

143
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,613
Not helping.

144
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,180
'From small beginnings
come great things. '

145
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,852
'Congratulations
on your new baby. '

146
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,958
I thought you
were gonna help.

147
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,363
Lighten up, Sherwood.

148
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,633
'The first time we met,
you stole my heart. '

149
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,575
'Good luck in finding
a compatible organ donor. ' Nice.

150
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,267
I'm kidding, okay?
It's blank inside.

151
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,506
You know something?
You're not too funny.

152
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,713
This girl is amazing...
unlike you...

153
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,014
and she's sensitive...
unlike you.

154
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,245
And she's sexy.

155
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,687
Unlike you.

156
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,054
There's gotta be a card...
- Is that Michael?

157
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,184
For a redhead from...
- I can't see.

158
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,162
A newly smitten
hunka hunka burning love.

159
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,221
I mean... Look.

160
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,128
Summer romance
has its own section.

161
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,661
It's not a summer romance. I mean...

162
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,334
Scarlett is...
- Standing right behind you, dude.

163
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,068
Hi.

164
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,040
Sneaking up on me?

165
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,044
Hi, Halley.
- Hi.

166
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,192
You remember my name?

167
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,228
Sure. We were in Biology together.

168
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,692
Yeah, I know, but...

169
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,461
well, you were never there,
really... technically.

170
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,363
I like your hair.

171
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,661
Thank you.

172
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,722
See, my schedule is all wrong,
which I think is a sign

173
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,525
that nothing's going
according to plan this year.

174
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,396
It's a complete and total mess.

175
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,202
Looks like a fine schedule to me.

176
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,640
No. Band?
I would never sign up for band.

177
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,507
What's wrong with band?
- I don't play anything.

178
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,240
Well, maybe you should.
I'm sure you can handle it.

179
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,712
Mrs. Toussaint,
this is not my schedule.

180
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,221
Look, I'm signed up for Algebra,
and I've already taken Calculus.

181
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:33,486
Maybe a brush-up is a good thing,
not to mention a good grade.

182
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,756
Why don't you just give it a shot
before you decide anything?

183
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,128
Okay, I'm signed up for boys' P. E.

184
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,293
94 FM
- Fill out this form.

185
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,132
Daddy Dog.
- We'll start again.

186
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,334
Len Martin with a traffic update
from that love puppy in the skies,

187
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,740
our very own Lorna Queen.

188
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,472
Lorna, you up there?

189
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,604
Hi, Len.

190
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,649
On a clear day,
you can see forever,

191
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,311
and this is one beautiful morning.

192
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,284
Should we tell everyone
our little secret?

193
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,949
Careful. Baby,
you sure this is the time?

194
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,255
I am bursting at the seams
to tell everyone we're eloping.

195
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,430
I just spilled the beans.

196
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,735
That is your father's show, right?

197
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,969
I just love it.

198
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,235
Hi.

199
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,577
Tell him congratulations.

200
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,714
I'm sure you're very excited
about the upcoming nuptials.

201
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,189
My father and my sister.

202
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,228
My sister and my father?

203
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,197
Your father and your sister
are getting married?

204
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,255
Yeah.

205
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,459
No, not to each other.

206
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,060
I...

207
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,469
I have to check something
before I fill this out.

208
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,870
Sit down, Forrester.

209
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,979
Let's see if we can
sort out your usual chaos.

210
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,044
Maybe you'll even do us
the honor of attending this year.

211
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,716
Okay, later, M. T.
I gotta rethink that shop class.

212
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,692
I'm pretty scary with tools.

213
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,052
My.

214
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,232
You didn't know
about your dad getting married?

215
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,290
Yes, I did.

216
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,137
The bastard tells
the whole world before he tells you.

217
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,366
He's not...

218
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,265
Whatever.

219
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,211
At least if they're eloping,
you won't have to go the wedding.

220
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,772
Weddings are the worst.

221
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,813
Me? I've had to go to,
like, five between my parents.

222
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,311
Don't ask.

223
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,956
Listen, M. T. Wasn't giving you
a hard time back there, was she?

224
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:52,953
'M. T. '?

225
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,365
Mrs. Toussaint and l...
we're on close terms.

226
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,199
You get to know
your guidance counselor really well

227
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,604
when you're clearly
in desperate need of guidance.

228
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,905
See, I've got it
down to a science.

229
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,307
You try the Jedi mind trick.

230
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,847
What's that?
- You never saw Star Wars?

231
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:15,819
No, I saw it. I guess I just
didn't memorize it like you did.

232
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,719
Well, that's your loss, isn't it?

233
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,351
Because the Jedi mind trick
is when you tell someone what to think,

234
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,485
and they think it.

235
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,961
For example, M. T. Says,

236
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,761
'Macon, you're already in trouble,
and it's the first day of school.

237
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,995
Is this any way
to start the new year? '

238
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,831
Pretend you're me.
Now what do you say?

239
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,204
Okay. I say...

240
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,042
No. I wanna be someone else.

241
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,441
Cute. No. You as me say...

242
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,953
Mrs. T, you're gonna
let this one slide

243
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,286
because it was
an honest mistake,

244
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,883
it's only the first day of school,

245
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,861
and the fire was put out
as quickly as it was started.

246
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,564
You didn't really
start a fire, did you?

247
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,929
The point is that you put
the words into somebody's mouth

248
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,907
and they give them back
like they've come up with the idea.

249
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,170
Like when I ask you
to go out this Friday night,

250
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,145
you're gonna think you're
asking me because you're gonna say,

251
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,704
'I would love to go out with you

252
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,376
'because I know
we'll have a great time together.

253
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,978
In fact, I've been hoping
you'd ask me all week. '

254
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,782
You wanna go out
on a date with me?

255
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,918
See? I told you you'd ask me.

256
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,798
Macon, I think I like you too much
already to actually go out with you.

257
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,198
What kind of logic is that?

258
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,600
It's logical logic.

259
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,833
The quickest way to ruin
a relationship with someone

260
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,606
is to actually try
to have a relationship with them.

261
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,649
Haven't you noticed when
the opposite sex gets together,

262
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,946
eventually someone
ends up getting hurt?

263
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,517
I am, too... boycotting.

264
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,955
You can't boycott
your father's wedding.

265
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,722
It's not even a wedding.
It's... an elopement.

266
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,630
Yeah, except everyone within
his radio frequency is invited.

267
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,361
My God.
He is such a hypocrite.

268
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,063
I cannot believe he wouldn't
tell us about it first.

269
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,503
He didn't give any warning
when you went dinner?

270
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,404
None.
- She was at that dinner?

271
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,898
No.

272
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,513
Okay, yeah.
She was there at the end.

273
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,779
Mom, come on. She wasn't
even supposed to be there.

274
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:30,185
You know, I don't think I'm gonna
let him walk me down the aisle.

275
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,255
Please stop worrying about me.
I am fine. I'm fine.

276
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,693
In a way, it sets me free.
I feel strangely liberated.

277
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,356
And he is still
your father, after all,

278
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,391
and if he wants to make
a complete and utter fool of himself

279
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,668
by trying in some
pathetically cliché fashion

280
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,972
to recapture
his sorry state of manhood,

281
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,013
by hooking up with not even
a very attractive bimbo...

282
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,538
then if that's what he wants,
I'm fine with that.

283
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,813
Someone toss, please.

284
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,478
Now.

285
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,953
This is our reception area.

286
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,956
With out post-ceremony
champagne bar...

287
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,001
which is conveniently located
right next to our very own chapel.

288
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,502
Can't you picture
walking down this aisle?

289
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,804
In a coffin.

290
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,912
Sorry, it's just...
a little depressing.

291
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,348
Actually, nobody's ever
said that before.

292
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,478
Lewis... say something.
What do you think?

293
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,887
Well, I like it.
It's very clean.

294
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,247
Clean?

295
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,689
Is that what you want
our wedding day to be? Clean?

296
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,991
It's not... it's not pretty,

297
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,659
it's not intimate,
it's not romantic.

298
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,396
I'm just so happy
that I get to marry you.

299
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,335
I'm sorry, not to pressure you,

300
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,873
but this space does
book up quickly for Spring.

301
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,238
We have another couple...

302
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,402
Why don't we
give them a moment to think.

303
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,511
Ashley, Sweetie,
they plan the whole thing.

304
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,541
The food, the flowers...
even the place cards.

305
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,020
Think about how much
less hassle it'll be.

306
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,820
You think planning the most
important day of our lives is a hassle?

307
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,889
It hasn't even been that long.

308
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,956
191/2 hours.

309
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,734
Wouldn't Michael
look cool in that?

310
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,063
Hey, I did a good job.

311
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,900
Michael Sherwood would
look good in anything.

312
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,946
That's not the point,
though, okay?

313
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,675
Enjoy him,
and fool around with him.

314
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,978
Don't fall in love with him.

315
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,714
Why do you think
they call it 'falling, ' anyways?

316
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,688
It's not worth it to you
to spend on a wedding.

317
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,247
It's the most important day.

318
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,624
I was trying to kill
two birds with one stone.

319
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,060
Cheap is what that is.

320
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,655
You see cheap,
I see convenience.

321
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,222
Look at them.

322
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,269
They're like a walking
warning sign against romance.

323
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,501
Lewis is this anal, uptight geek
who has my sister under some spell.

324
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,566
Now all this formerly
semi-intelligent person thinks about

325
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,239
is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit.

326
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,303
It's like K-Mart.

327
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,543
How am I supposed
to know what it looks like?

328
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,416
Maybe go by and look
at it? Or maybe...

329
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,387
See? They don't
even like each other.

330
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,825
But this stupid spell they're under
makes them disregard all the facts.

331
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:26,195
They are fighting because they
love each other enough to care.

332
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,325
I didn't know it looked
like a K-Mart before I went there.

333
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,564
Once we got in there, you knew.
- I made a mistake.

334
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,471
Too bad you can't get
a divorce before getting married.

335
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,601
You could save yourself
in that stupid extra step.

336
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,271
I'm sorry.
- See?

337
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,679
What are you looking for?
- These dishes, they're perfect.

338
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,052
That's love, Halley.

339
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:56,325
Okay, fall once and you may never
be able to get back up again.

340
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,793
Geek!
Get out of here.

341
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,869
Isn't he adorable?

342
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,737
He's cute.

343
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,756
All right, Michael!

344
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,563
Way to get that goal!

345
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,469
Okay, guys, line up!

346
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,430
Okay, back up.
Let's give him some air.

347
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,004
Sherwood? You hear me?

348
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,786
Guys, back up.
Give him some air, all right?

349
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,782
Call the doctor.

350
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,636
I thought my parents' divorce
was the end of the world.

351
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,907
That was before
Michael died of a heart defect.

352
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,676
And the world stopped.

353
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,805
Or it should have.

354
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,736
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,712
What do you think?

356
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,013
I think it's 100 degrees out.

357
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,058
What am I supposed to do?

358
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,526
The only black clothes
I have are winter clothes.

359
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,857
I have nothing nice to wear.

360
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,062
I don't think it matters, really.

361
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:56,130
Look, this is... this is
dark green and it's really nice.

362
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,869
It's ugly, Halley.

363
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,837
I'm just trying to think
about something else.

364
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,343
Anything, for one single second.

365
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,861
I wanna look good for him.

366
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,965
Does that sound crazy?

367
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,572
This was a bad idea.

368
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,270
Yeah, but dying is definitely
not one of the better concepts.

369
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,080
No, the dress. Everyone's
looking at me like I'm a freak.

370
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,551
Okay, it's not for them.
It's for Michael.

371
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,881
Remember that.

372
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,785
Can you believe
what she's wearing?

373
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,986
That's, like, so disrespectful.

374
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,723
She always has to have
all the attention to herself.

375
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,593
'Although it droop
and die that night,

376
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,662
it was the plant
and flower of light.

377
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,333
In small proportions,
we just beauty see.

378
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,738
And in short measures,

379
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,410
life may perfect be.

380
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,121
Mr. Macon Forrester
will now address us.

381
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,136
I was gonna read from this...

382
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,482
but I'm not very good at reading.

383
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,914
Or writing...

384
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,322
or spelling.

385
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,492
Not like Michael.

386
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,697
He was good at so many things
without even trying.

387
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,365
He taught me how to be myself.

388
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,198
By myself.

389
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,374
Not to worry
about what other people think.

390
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,338
Even if that means
being completely uncool.

391
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,982
He taught me about
how to trust people.

392
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,158
And how to love.

393
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,528
'Cause he was so good.

394
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,431
He loved his family,
he loved his friends.

395
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,162
He loved basketball.

396
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,528
And he loved Scarlett.

397
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,534
And he loved this.

398
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,192
Take this woman, Lorna Queen,
to be your lawful wedded wife,

399
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,164
your partner, the queen
of your heart, forever and ever?

400
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,291
Yeah!

401
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,199
Daddy, rock on
with your woman!

402
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,666
And do you,
Lorna P. Queen,

403
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,642
take this old guy Len to be
your lawfully wedded husband

404
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,803
for all the rest of your days?

405
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:28,868
I do.

406
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,415
Wrap it up.
We're off in 15 seconds. Go.

407
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,819
Our airtime is almost up.

408
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,590
We must now go
where Federal regulations

409
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,961
will not allow you to follow,
if you know what I mean.

410
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,495
Lewis, no barking.

411
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,975
Sorry, but you gotta go.

412
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,381
Poor little thing.

413
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,552
I know just how it feels.

414
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,527
Out with the old,
in with the new.

415
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,522
And who do you think you are?

416
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,429
Just because
you've got great petals.

417
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,505
My God.
I'm talking to my plants.

418
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,603
My God.

419
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,340
You're talking to your plants.

420
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,742
How was it?

421
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,143
It was great...

422
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,382
if you happen to be the Devil
and enjoy human pain.

423
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,117
Tell me something.

424
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,619
I don't know!
What do you want me to tell you?

425
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:52,492
Wait! No, the bimbo
almost died of strangulation.

426
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,555
I cannot believe I forgot to tell you.

427
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,658
Her wedding veil took on
a life of its own and rebelled,

428
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,363
and she had to claw
her way out.

429
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,632
And you know
that woman can claw.

430
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,731
It was so sad.
It was like...

431
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,038
near death by wedding veil.

432
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,412
Just tragic, isn't it?

433
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,506
My God!
And their vows?

434
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,983
Was Dad that much a loser
when you guys got married?

435
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,282
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,986
Your father's not a loser.

437
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,998
Although he did choose
to look like one at our wedding, too.

438
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,433
He insisted on wearing
a powder-blue tuxedo.

439
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,874
Then why do people
get married, anyways?

440
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,852
We know
they're lying to each other,

441
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,912
but are they lying
to themselves, too?

442
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,654
How can you promise you're
gonna feel the same way forever?

443
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,198
Things do
sometimes change, Halley.

444
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,234
This house is awfully big for just
the two of us, don't you think?

445
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,478
What?
- You'll be going to college soon.

446
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,643
Mom... a year and 3/4
is not really that soon.

447
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,050
I want to start thinking
about streamlining.

448
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,850
Maybe we should
sell the house.

449
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,424
I grew up in this house.

450
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,587
Yes, and there have been
some great memories in this house.

451
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,823
This is my house.

452
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,298
I understand how you
must feel, but life changes.

453
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,892
This is ridiculous, Mom!
Come on!

454
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,872
And I don't want to live here alone.

455
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,625
I have to give him a ride.

456
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,127
Bye, Halley.

457
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,108
Stand back!
Leaf man to the rescue.

458
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,135
Where did you get that?

459
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,545
A guy's gotta pay for gas
and bacon burgers somehow, right?

460
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,106
And toys, 'cause I imagine

461
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,846
Star Wars figurines
must get pretty expensive.

462
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,252
I do not have
any Star Wars figurines.

463
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,857
Not many,
and I don't play with them... much.

464
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,789
This one's on the house.

465
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:40,920
Okay.

466
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,623
Here you go.

467
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,898
You're afraid to go out with me
because you might like me?

468
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,035
No, but that's
a good theory, I guess,

469
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,842
if you want to protect
your fragile male ego.

470
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,883
'Cause you can't handle rejection.

471
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,645
Rejection? Whatever!

472
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,497
Of course you think it's weird
that I didn't just use the phone,

473
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,969
but you're also glad because
it's much better to talk in person.

474
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,030
Especially when I've come
with such a specific purpose.

475
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,541
Which is why you're
gonna cut me some slack.

476
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,138
You are absolutely crazy.

477
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,547
I've been called worse.

478
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,879
You're gonna kiss me, Halley.

479
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,147
You're gonna come a little closer...

480
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,489
so I can put
my arms around you.

481
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,101
And on the count of three...

482
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,761
two...

483
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,929
one.

484
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,047
You're a really good kisser.

485
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,319
You tricked me.

486
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,889
You Jedi mind-tricked me.

487
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,796
Halley, is that you out there?

488
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,737
Close your eyes. Go to bed.

489
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,139
Give me a break.
- Who are you talking to?

490
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,577
I'm sorry, I...

491
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,706
Sorry.

492
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,346
I just... I needed to talk.

493
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,684
I was just coming over
for a little late-night chat.

494
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,356
We're not gonna
stay up very late, okay?

495
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,628
At least do it inside.

496
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,695
'Nausea'?

497
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,160
A little.

498
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,303
'Breast tenderness'?

499
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,940
Yeah. Major.

500
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,079
'Food cravings'?

501
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,451
Grapefruit.

502
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,454
Come on, I could answer 'yes'
to most of these questions, too.

503
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,121
I used to hate grapefruit.

504
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,392
What's wrong?

505
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,002
No offense, Halley, but...

506
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,402
your perfume is making me sick.

507
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,472
Come on, I'm not
wearing perfume. I use soap.

508
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,521
'Heightened sense of smell. '

509
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,654
Okay, so do you prefer
direct pee-on-a-strip

510
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,061
or dip-in-a-cup?

511
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,101
Maybe it's a false reading.

512
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,229
Because I have heard
of things such as false readings.

513
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,774
And the strips did not
look completely pink,

514
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,275
only kind of pinkish, so...

515
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,004
Five kits, Halley.

516
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,176
What am I gonna do?

517
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,141
So you take the car
without my permission

518
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,939
in the middle of the night
on some kind of joy ride.

519
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,241
It wasn't a joy ride.
- Maybe I should...

520
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,441
Don't think you're off the hook.

521
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,212
You don't even have your license,
and you are a terrible driver.

522
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,415
I was helping Scarlett get
some books at school... we left them...

523
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,821
Forget it, Halley!

524
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,448
Mom...

525
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,855
taking your car out
is gonna seem like the least of it...

526
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,156
because whatever
you're thinking right now...

527
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:19,927
it's worse.

528
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,468
One of you better tell me
before I have a nervous breakdown.

529
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,054
I'm pregnant.

530
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,528
Well, thank God
you told me in time.

531
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,236
Shouldn't I be getting paid
to wear a dress this ugly?

532
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,975
I'm sorry if you hate my taste

533
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,984
and you think it's so awful
you have to be in my wedding,

534
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,383
but you are my sister.

535
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,388
It's an emotional time.
- All right. I was just joking.

536
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,358
Just because you think up something
you think is funny, doesn't mean you say it.

537
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,494
Okay, Ashley,
I'm sorry, all right?

538
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,965
It's just...
I love the dress, really.

539
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,435
I feel like a princess.
You know?

540
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,638
I look awful.

541
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:37,936
We'll fix it.

542
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,210
It's not the dress
that needs fixing.

543
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,615
It's me.

544
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,612
Ashley, would you
drive Halley home?

545
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,351
I have to get back to work.

546
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,272
Give me my money back,

547
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:12,681
you stupid, lying, feckless,
two-timing son of a bitch!

548
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,310
Can I help you, ma'am?

549
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,365
It stole my money, so, just...

550
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,290
Here.

551
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,338
This works
a little better sometimes.

552
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,749
What's your pleasure?
- Diet Coke sounds good.

553
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,407
The last one.

554
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,480
On me.

555
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,260
I hope I didn't,
you know, kick it too...

556
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,429
I think these machines are built

557
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,093
to withstand a good booting
every now and then.

558
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,234
Steve Beckwith.
- Lydia Martin.

559
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,238
Did I say 'Martin'?

560
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,472
It's Lydia Williams now.

561
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,137
Lydia Williams again.
- Williams, again?

562
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,474
Nice to meet you.

563
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,609
Thank you.

564
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,652
Aren't you gonna wear lipstick?

565
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,592
You sound like Mom.

566
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,252
Can one of you zip me, please?

567
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,563
You guys know you're
wearing the same dress, right?

568
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,756
Unbelievable.

569
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,930
You're grandmother's
in there changing.

570
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,165
We practically are.

571
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,968
I'll change.
- No, I'll change.

572
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,737
I can change.
- No, I shouldn't wear black, anyway.

573
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:50,303
Halley, could you please wear
something a little more feminine?

574
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,714
Because the Warshers
are really traditional. Thank you.

575
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,276
Sweetheart,
do you need the loo?

576
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,283
Grandma, no.
I'm gonna use the one downstairs.

577
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,191
Don't be silly.
Come on in.

578
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,092
Okay.
- I'm almost through.

579
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,541
It smells like...

580
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,809
Just burning a little incense.

581
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,874
Mother?

582
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,812
Are you smoking
the cannabis again?

583
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,456
I had a little headache.

584
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,290
But I'm feeling
really much better now.

585
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,796
I knew we'd be late.

586
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,032
We're fine.

587
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,110
His parents are promptness nuts.

588
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,143
I can't believe I'm late.

589
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:00,380
That's what happens when
you make people change ten times.

590
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,980
These leaves would make
a wonderful textile.

591
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,388
Halley, look.

592
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:13,554
I'll bet if we make
sheets of this pattern,

593
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,622
we'd make a million dollars!

594
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,860
Mother, please, not now.

595
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,363
She's high.

596
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,770
She's not high,
she's medicated.

597
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:31,705
It's interesting...
when you make the 'ow' sound,

598
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:35,149
your mouth does
this funny thing in the corner.

599
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,550
You're not sick anymore.

600
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,248
You were only allowed
to use weed when you were sick.

601
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,814
Could you ring the bell?
- I do get headaches a lot.

602
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,881
Smile.

603
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,591
Does anyone else
hear wind chimes or is it just me?

604
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,098
This is a total disaster.

605
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,056
Shit!

606
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,430
Hello.

607
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,970
Now, I know it's turkey day,

608
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,569
but we thought squab
would be most special.

609
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,240
They're absolutely adorable.

610
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,981
Squab.
- Can I say I'm a vegetarian?

611
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,043
No.

612
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,649
It reminds me of a little
yellow parakeet I had when I was a girl.

613
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,755
Such a sweet, smart little bird.

614
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,295
They look wonderful.
- Thank you.

615
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,492
Marcella's such
a truly magnificent cook.

616
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,504
We are lucky
to have found her.

617
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,733
I bet there's a story in that.

618
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,168
Tell me, how lost were you
before you were found?

619
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:39,747
Because you look like a lady
who doesn't get lost very often.

620
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:40,806
Grandma.

621
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,988
She came with us 20 years ago,
when we moved here from Atlanta.

622
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,149
She really raised our Lewis.

623
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,658
I didn't realize
you were a working mother.

624
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,096
I wasn't.

625
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,564
She did go through
a brokerage training program.

626
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,037
She was good.
Killer instinct.

627
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,274
But she set her sights
on me, instead.

628
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,072
I'd say I got
the best deal at the firm.

629
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,476
He's all right.

630
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:13,209
He's no Clark Gable...
but then very few men are.

631
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,546
What was the name
of that character?

632
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:18,781
Ashley.

633
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,088
No, you're Ashley.

634
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,432
The wedding plans
are coming along beautifully.

635
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,561
Well, you holler if you need
any help at all, understand?

636
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,105
I want this to be
a memorable affair.

637
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,607
Carol does throw
one heck of a luncheon.

638
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,577
That is my one regret
about not having more children.

639
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,840
Having girls
must be such fun.

640
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,405
But we always felt
that having an only child

641
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,316
was a much better way
to mold and shape character.

642
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,718
Ashley was alone
for her first six years.

643
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,280
I like to think she got
the best of both worlds.

644
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,517
My best friend is an only child.

645
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,228
She's having a baby,

646
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,665
which at our age is something
that obviously wasn't planned.

647
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,898
And her mom is not really
thrilled about the whole situation,

648
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:12,999
but I really think she's kind of
starting to get behind it now,

649
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,066
so...

650
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,183
Which way to the bathroom?

651
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,223
Down the hall and to your left.

652
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,180
Isn't it a surprise... our children
choosing to get married so young?

653
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,654
I always thought Lewis would
take his time to find the right person.

654
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,325
Well, it must be
the example of you and Dad.

655
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:09,226
I mean...
you make marriage seem so fun.

656
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,067
And Ashley's
a lot like you, Mom.

657
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,232
She's a very determined woman.

658
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,953
Open the door, Halley.

659
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:34,813
Young lady?

660
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,053
Open the door.
Are you all right?

661
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,170
Lovely evening. Thank you.

662
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:58,441
Thanks for sticking up for me.
- What are you talking about?

663
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,484
Your mom obviously
doesn't want you to get married.

664
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,551
You made it sound
like I'm some desperate woman

665
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,885
somehow forcing you
into the whole thing.

666
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:07,946
I did not.

667
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,084
'Ashley's a very
determined woman. '

668
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,320
I didn't say that.

669
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,829
I have witnesses!
Mom, you were there.

670
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,990
You did say something
along those lines.

671
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,693
Well, that is not
how I meant it.

672
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,260
Lewis, you have a lovely family
and that is what is important.

673
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,602
They weren't
exactly lovely to you.

674
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:29,206
'Oh, You actually work for a living,
you lower class, pathetic divorcée? '

675
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,769
Ashley, enough.

676
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,244
I'm the one who got
humped by a dog in there.

677
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,353
Where are we?
- You'll see when we get there.

678
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,023
It's too dark to see.
- Well, just hold on.

679
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,775
Me and Sherwood found
this place a couple years ago.

680
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,769
We used to come here.

681
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,310
You like it?

682
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:21,588
Yeah.

683
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,452
Yeah, come on. Let's dance.

684
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,518
No.
- Yes.

685
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,227
Come on, Macon.

686
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,292
No.

687
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,471
Please? Come on, Macon.

688
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,730
No.
- Please.

689
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,341
You look great, but I just...

690
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,476
Michael's parents
moved to Florida.

691
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,711
You still have to tell them.

692
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,579
I know.

693
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,625
I just can't figure out
what to say that makes any sense.

694
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:37,128
Which makes sense, given that none
of what's happened makes any sense.

695
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,660
You know, it's weird.

696
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,735
Because if you were
the one that was pregnant...

697
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:50,635
I would understand you
considering having an abortion

698
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,115
or putting the baby
up for adoption.

699
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,619
You can still put
the baby up for adoption.

700
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:00,779
No.

701
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,083
I know all the arguments.

702
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,124
And I know
what I'm giving up.

703
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:16,004
And I know that nothing is
gonna be normal for me anymore.

704
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,409
But what is normal, anyway?

705
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,804
Growing up
with my mom sure wasn't.

706
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,841
Losing Michael wasn't.

707
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:38,888
I used to think that my family was
the picture-perfect example of normal.

708
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,052
Us.

709
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,767
Maybe being abnormal
is what's normal... right?

710
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,395
Yeah, like you and Macon.

711
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,304
It doesn't make sense...

712
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,865
you falling in love
with a guy like him.

713
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,072
I'm not falling in love
with him, I like kissing him.

714
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,106
We're just friends.

715
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,275
With benefits.

716
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,345
Shut up.

717
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:07,284
Bye, I'm leaving.
- You've got it bad.

718
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,510
I hope this isn't a bad time.

719
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,013
I know this is awfully
forward of me, but...

720
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,146
I can't stop thinking about you.

721
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,999
You're out of uniform.

722
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,834
That. I forgot I was
wearing that. Didn't I explain?

723
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,877
I'm a Civil War reenactor...
a little hobby.

724
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:05,438
I like thinking about a time when honor
and chivalry really meant something.

725
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,050
I know I've been
slow to take action.

726
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,108
Slows good.

727
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,815
Would dinner tonight be too fast?

728
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:14,646
Yes.

729
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,288
I mean, no.
I mean, I'd love to.

730
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,034
Cheers.

731
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:06,998
Friends?

732
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:08,933
Friends.

733
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,340
Steve, I had a lovely time.

734
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:28,953
Good night.

735
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,436
I was just...
- You were just leaving.

736
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,602
Exactly.

737
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,874
This is how you conduct
yourself in your own home?

738
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,442
You said it...
my own home.

739
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,318
That implies I have a right
to choose what I do.

740
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,052
Halley Marie Martin,
conduct unbecoming.

741
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:57,715
No!

742
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,733
You never told me
you were serious about this boy.

743
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,463
I'm not serious.

744
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,097
That's what you do with people
you're not serious about?

745
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,162
You know what?

746
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,300
Maybe if you had
a little bit more fun,

747
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,901
you wouldn't be
in the position you're in right now.

748
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,140
Where is all
this attitude coming from?

749
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,704
This is not like you.

750
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,512
Like me?
You don't even know me.

751
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:24,075
Maybe you're just not
very good at knowing people.

752
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,179
How well do you know
that strange boy?

753
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,089
Mom, He's not strange, okay?
His name is Macon.

754
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,525
And maybe if you paid
attention to anyone...

755
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:35,587
God forbid... besides yourself
and Ashley and her stupid wedding,

756
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,996
you would know that.

757
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,308
I'm trying.

758
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:59,552
Halley, you used to talk to me.

759
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,955
Yeah, and you were
too busy hating Dad to listen.

760
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,597
I'm sorry you've had
to go through this.

761
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,874
I hate Dad...

762
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,881
so much for doing this to us.

763
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,881
I hate him, I hate him.

764
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,789
And then I don't hate him,
and I feel bad for hating him...

765
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,351
Sweetie, I don't want
you to hate your father.

766
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,090
He's a decent man.

767
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,465
I don't want you
to hate me either,

768
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,700
but I am going to have to start
laying down some rules around here.

769
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:51,763
Here we go.

770
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,241
Halley, you're grounded
until next year.

771
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,299
No.

772
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,038
You promised me that I could go

773
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:01,345
to the New Year's Eve party
with Macon... Mom, please!

774
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,649
No. No buts,
no New Year's Eve, no Macon.

775
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:07,879
God!

776
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,099
'Dear Mr. And Mrs. Sherwood...

777
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,899
Guess what?
You're gonna be grandparents'...

778
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:25,638
Exclamation point.

779
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,843
Why don't you try telling Michael's
parents what you really feel?

780
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,055
Macon Land.

781
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,056
Happy New Year.

782
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,401
Happy New Year.

783
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,985
Hey, Macon, the man.

784
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,042
Hi.

785
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,549
The party's just arrived.
- The party has... I'm here.

786
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,293
Yeah.
- Okay. Hold still.

787
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,690
Sorry.

788
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,640
Now, you are pretty.

789
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,818
Come on, you can
smile better than that.

790
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,191
What? She doesn't
know how to smile?

791
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,749
Maybe she doesn't want to.

792
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,761
Well, excuse me for breathing.

793
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,660
Yeah, you're breathing too close.

794
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,960
Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

795
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,063
Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

796
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,565
Here's to the new year, right?

797
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,075
Yeah, right.
To the... to the new year.

798
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,578
Okay, knock-knock. Police raid.

799
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,418
Hey, Macon, my man... what's up?

800
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:52,977
What's up with you?

801
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,915
I lost my damn earring.

802
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:58,983
Hey, Macon.

803
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,492
Hi, Halley.

804
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:04,722
Hi.

805
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:06,691
Thanks.

806
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:13,401
Nice name.

807
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,841
Who wants to see my ferret?

808
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,148
Dude, I have one.
Come on, dude.

809
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,046
I put a little hat on him
and everything. It's awesome.

810
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,930
So, when's
Scarlett due, anyway?

811
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,570
You know?

812
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,375
Yeah, my mom's
a bookkeeper in her doctor's office,

813
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,382
but... don't worry.
I haven't told anyone.

814
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,882
Third week of May.

815
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,445
God, that is so freaky.

816
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,088
You know, it's weird, but...

817
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,219
I didn't even know
they had hooked up.

818
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,823
Really?
They went out all summer.

819
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:10,957
Did they?

820
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,502
Yeah, and he was
completely in love with her.

821
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,766
She's ruining her life, you know.

822
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,102
I think I'd kill myself
before I had a baby.

823
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,007
I know enough to know
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

824
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:25,142
You're probably right,
because you're not Scarlett.

825
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:26,771
Right.

826
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,948
Thank God for that.

827
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,617
What's wrong?

828
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,222
I'm sorry.

829
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,939
Halley, where are you going?

830
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:49,781
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

831
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,022
six, five, four,

832
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:56,189
three, two, one.

833
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:20,815
I'm sorry.

834
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,194
I really am.

835
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,959
What was that all about?

836
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,773
I thought you wanted
us to be together.

837
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:46,108
I do... but, 'together'?

838
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:52,986
It's so official
and so big for us.

839
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:56,522
Maybe you should just say
what you feel for once.

840
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,592
I could do that.

841
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:02,753
I can.

842
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,226
I can.

843
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:12,096
I felt like I had to get
out of there because I might...

844
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:15,837
really...

845
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,572
care about you, and...

846
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,516
and it scared me so much
because that meant that...

847
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,756
you could hurt me.

848
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,795
Or maybe I just
didn't feel ready.

849
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,067
To like someone... that much.

850
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,034
And I like you.

851
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,570
Don't make it
so complicated, Halley.

852
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,657
Some people fall in love.

853
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,960
I had to crash into it.

854
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,013
Hey, Baby.

855
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:10,885
Hi.

856
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,488
I'm sorry.

857
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,261
You gave us quite a scare.

858
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,527
God.

859
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,367
And I ruined your party, too.

860
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,470
I'm not concerned with the party.

861
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,840
Your date with Steve. I know
that was so important to you.

862
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,402
Halley, I know you were
with Macon Forrester.

863
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,413
Mom, it was not his fault, though.

864
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,010
We were trying to leave
this really bad party.

865
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,251
He was letting me drive...
you know I'm like the worst driver,

866
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:43,814
and I could not even see...

867
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:48,057
Halley, save your strength. You're gonna
need it to come up with better excuses.

868
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,713
Macon wasn't there
when I woke up.

869
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,482
Macon wasn't there when I left.

870
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:20,656
Macon wasn't there
the whole next week at school.

871
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,188
What do you expect
when you break your own rules?

872
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,197
Any word from him?

873
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,260
No.

874
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,237
I guess that's
what guys are good at, right?

875
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,002
Disappearing?

876
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,636
Hey. I'm back.

877
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,809
You really don't get it, do you?

878
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:19,076
I'm really not in the mood
to wait for you to grow up.

879
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:16,342
My... are you okay?

880
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,540
Hi, Halley.

881
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,509
I think I just dropped my keys.

882
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,349
No, they're in the door. Come on.

883
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:29,423
Stop spinning! Stop spinning.

884
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,083
I'm not spinning!

885
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,122
Quiet!

886
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,593
Maybe you should be quiet.

887
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,933
That's what you should do.

888
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,764
Upstairs.

889
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,500
Halley,
you're such a good sister.

890
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:51,510
You think I'm doing those?
I am not doing those.

891
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,569
Be careful.

892
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,981
Christ, Halley.
It's all right.

893
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:01,387
This is my bachelorette party.

894
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,983
I am a bachelorette.

895
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:20,633
Thank you, little sister.

896
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,140
You are the greatest.

897
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:26,545
Okay, Ashley,
please just take this.

898
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,171
Jesus. What...

899
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,142
You just...

900
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:38,051
Please. Come on.
Mom is upstairs sleeping.

901
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,458
Mom's not home.

902
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,228
Really? And how
would you know that?

903
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,769
Friday night she sneaks out
to have sex with Steve.

904
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,672
She told you that?

905
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,405
She didn't want you to know.

906
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,675
God, why do people think
that I can't handle the truth?

907
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,791
Go on, you hatchet-faced scarecrow!

908
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,093
You baboon!

909
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,930
You bag of bones!
- You old weasel face!

910
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,436
Sourpuss!
- Sorry old flabby nincompoop!

911
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:25,904
Top of the morning to you.

912
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:27,831
How is she?

913
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:33,136
Sweetie.

914
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,184
A hangover kit.

915
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,086
Not to appear superior,
but I did limit myself

916
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,756
to one glass of champagne,
thank you very much.

917
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:52,562
If it wasn't for Halley,
I would've died, probably.

918
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,068
No, you just would've
woken up on the porch.

919
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,895
Bet the neighbors
would've loved that.

920
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:02,671
Right, especially with the men's
underwear around her neck.

921
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:05,606
Underwear?

922
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,911
It was nothing. It was stupid.

923
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:10,918
Underwear is not nothing.

924
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,988
No, they were
pretty much nothing.

925
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,851
We promised
each other no strippers.

926
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:23,762
I know, Lewis, I know, but
I was at the mercy of my friends.

927
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,392
Don't promises we make
to each other mean anything?

928
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,663
Of course they mean
something, Lewis.

929
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,170
God, don't be so uptight!

930
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,003
I'm uptight?
I'm not uptight!

931
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,100
Yes, Lewis, you are.
You are uptight.

932
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,441
You know what else?
Halley was right about you.

933
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,777
You have got
a broomstick up your butt.

934
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,110
I never said that!

935
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,946
Okay, well, guess who put it there?

936
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:45,816
Don't talk to me that way.
Maybe I'll find somebody fun!

937
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,719
To tell the truth,
you're no fun!

938
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,485
We made
a promise to each other,

939
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,425
but you don't keep it
because you're self-absorbed.

940
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,893
Don't talk to me that way.

941
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,520
Hello. Good morning, Halley.

942
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,527
What's going on?
- I think they're breaking up.

943
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,761
Relax. You're no fun.

944
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,771
Marriage is a promise,
and a promise has to be kept.

945
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,171
Not every argument
leads to a breakup.

946
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:08,534
For real!

947
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,179
The wedding is off.

948
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:58,717
I've been trying to say I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry doesn't always cut it, Macon!

949
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,595
I couldn't stay
with you at the hospital.

950
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,966
I know I should have, but think
how much more freaked out

951
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:11,528
your mom would've got
if she'd have seen me.

952
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,740
My God.

953
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,172
Okay. Wow, thank you so much.

954
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:22,115
So, you were ditching me
for my own benefit.

955
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,844
No, that's not it.

956
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,387
I didn't ditch you.

957
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,082
L...

958
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,694
Okay, I...

959
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,164
I freaked out.

960
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:44,033
I'm not used to feeling
this way about somebody.

961
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:45,437
And I just...

962
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,866
I couldn't believe
I almost lost you, too.

963
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:59,285
Here. Come on,
I'll help you eat them.

964
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,357
No. I don't want any.

965
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,090
I can't see you anymore.

966
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,829
Your mom will get over it.

967
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,063
It's not my mom. It's me.

968
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:21,932
And, of course,
if you do decide to get married,

969
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,104
I can get my makeup and hair people
to do you on the big day.

970
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,045
If you decide
not to get married,

971
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:31,017
I think you should let them
do some work on you anyway,

972
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,987
because you are gonna
want to look your best

973
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,717
when you get back out there.

974
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,986
Darling, there is nothing wrong
with canceling a wedding.

975
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,295
No, it's indefinitely postponed.

976
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,767
That's what we're
supposed to say officially.

977
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:49,363
My mom found out.

978
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:53,431
Actually, I haven't really made up
my mind yet, so if everybody could just...

979
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:54,839
Honey.

980
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,943
Give me a hug.

981
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:04,485
Sweetie, you never know
what's gonna happen. Okay?

982
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:07,283
For a while there,
I thought I'd never get married.

983
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:09,720
Finally, I had to put my foot down

984
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,282
or my guy here
would never have left...

985
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:21,662
I'll get that.

986
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:27,664
Hello?

987
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:33,712
Honey, it's their mother
calling from Virginia.

988
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:36,114
It seems
your grandmother had a bad fall.

989
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,345
Your mother wants you
to meet her there.

990
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,387
Do you think
she's okay in there?

991
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:46,558
It has been a while.

992
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,421
Grandma, are you all right?

993
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:54,862
Yes, I'm just smoking
a little marijuana.

994
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:58,834
Look at that pattern.

995
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:04,811
Is it just me, or is that the
spittin' image of Abraham Lincoln?

996
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,577
Look, Halley, look.
There's the mole.

997
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,176
Halley, you must see it!

998
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:15,087
You're the one who sees
things no one else can see.

999
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,988
I do?
- Yes.

1000
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:19,357
Mother, you're not
supposed to be walking yet.

1001
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:22,864
Next time you fall like that,
you're going to break your hip, then die.

1002
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:30,268
You remember when we
went to see our comet together?

1003
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,564
Halley was too young
to remember that.

1004
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,802
No, I do remember.

1005
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,504
You can't possibly.
You remember hearing about it.

1006
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:38,910
No, mom, I do remember.

1007
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,108
Why does no one trust me
to know what I know anymore?

1008
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,515
God.

1009
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:46,876
God!

1010
01:18:56,965 --> 01:19:00,560
She doesn't even think
that my own memories belong to me.

1011
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,504
Darling, she's your mother.

1012
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:18,045
Now, tell me
about this fella of yours.

1013
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:20,945
Who told you about that?

1014
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,754
Grandma, it's really over.

1015
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:32,164
First loves are never really over.

1016
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:37,364
Nobody's perfect, Sweetheart.

1017
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,602
But that doesn't mean
it wasn't worth your while.

1018
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,004
Boy!
Do I have the munchies!

1019
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,691
What about him?
- He's not terrible looking.

1020
01:19:56,758 --> 01:20:00,592
Yeah, he's even cute in that
geeky way that you like guys, Ashley.

1021
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,523
Halley, it's...

1022
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,359
It's Lewis.

1023
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:37,464
Ashley, love of my life...

1024
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,497
life of my heart...

1025
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:44,138
once again... will you marry me?

1026
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:51,876
Yes.

1027
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,305
Yes. How crazy.

1028
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,411
I can't believe it.

1029
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,248
Do it.

1030
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:21,239
I owe you one.

1031
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,801
For?

1032
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,871
Macon's a really great guy.

1033
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:28,538
See ya, Halley.

1034
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:45,596
Hey.
- Hi.

1035
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:52,832
I had no idea
that you guys were like...

1036
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,137
hanging out.

1037
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:57,772
Elizabeth Gunderson and me?

1038
01:21:57,846 --> 01:21:58,835
No, we're just...

1039
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,745
Friends?
- Yeah.

1040
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:02,672
Right.

1041
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:07,114
No, it's fine because
we had our thing,

1042
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:10,351
and it was fun...
until it wasn't anymore, right?

1043
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,585
No, that's not it.

1044
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,721
When the going gets tough, it's best
to just keep going, don't you think?

1045
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,331
Would you listen to me for a sec?

1046
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:31,843
And to my bride.

1047
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:35,747
Thank you for showing me
that socks don't need to be ironed...

1048
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:39,348
that one needn't employ
the Dewey decimal system

1049
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,978
for their CD collection...

1050
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,424
and that, in the end, it doesn't
make a whole lot of difference

1051
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,462
whether you start
the toilet paper facing up or down.

1052
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,458
Despite what
my parents taught me.

1053
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:57,961
Because, Ashley, you have
shown me that life is worth embracing.

1054
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,530
Even if it means
making a giant fool of yourself.

1055
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,070
And lucky for me,

1056
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,545
you're willing to marry the guy
who's been the biggest fool of all.

1057
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:08,878
So here's to a lifetime

1058
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:13,546
of big, messy,
wonderfully out-of-order moments

1059
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:15,953
with the most
beautiful woman in the world...

1060
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,355
my bride.

1061
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:05,404
Your big sister
is getting married in 31/2 hours.

1062
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,902
You know if you
get nervous, you can always...

1063
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:15,405
You remember the sign.

1064
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:17,815
Of course. You taught
it to me, remember?

1065
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:19,776
So, you know. Just...

1066
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:22,445
Like that.

1067
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,760
I'll do something.
I'll yell, 'fire, ' okay?

1068
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,192
Okay.
- Okay.

1069
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,894
And we're back
with the big dog of soft rock,

1070
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:38,200
WDYG, 94 FM.
'We dig the dog. '

1071
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:40,503
This is Daddy Dog
himself, Len Martin,

1072
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:43,135
coming to you today
on a very special day,

1073
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,907
'cause one of my
very own puppies... the eldest...

1074
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,572
Ashley, is getting married.

1075
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:50,311
Lorna, Honey,
any words of wisdom

1076
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,910
coming from you,
my very own newlywed?

1077
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,285
Waterproof mascara.

1078
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:59,122
I'm gonna borrow yours, 'cause
Daddy's gonna be weeping like a baby.

1079
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:02,129
All right, let's kick off
this Power Hour Of Love.

1080
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:05,390
Are you there?
- Security?

1081
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,935
Hey, give me... come on.
This is my job!

1082
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:12,295
My Halley?

1083
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:15,001
I don't know how to get you
to listen, but maybe...

1084
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:17,840
Let him talk.
- Just hear me out.

1085
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,176
I suck with words.

1086
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,286
But sometimes,
words aren't the thing.

1087
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:28,982
Love isn't about words,
it's about what you do.

1088
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,321
And what I did...

1089
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:34,793
running away, it was stupid.

1090
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:38,860
We both know love's
a big, scary, evil concept.

1091
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,369
But if you feel it, it's gonna
follow you around like a hungry dog

1092
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:43,927
no matter how far you run.

1093
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,473
Wait. I didn't mean
to say love's a dog.

1094
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,704
I just mean,
I'm not going anywhere.

1095
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:51,901
I love you, Halley.

1096
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:56,006
If love beats us up,
let's beat it up right back.

1097
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,415
We could do this.

1098
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,977
If you're ready to make the jump,
I'll be right here to catch you.

1099
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:12,756
And what a powerful
Power Hour Of Love it has been.

1100
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:18,033
This is Len Martin for WDYG,
the Big Dog of soft rock.

1101
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:19,971
That's right.
Romance is in the air.

1102
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:21,941
It's everywhere
here today, folks.

1103
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,241
This next song is going out
to that young lady in question...

1104
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:28,043
Miss Halley Martin
and her big sister Ashley,

1105
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:29,777
'cause Daddy loves you.

1106
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,736
You look beautiful.

1107
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,732
You look beautiful, Mom.

1108
01:26:58,246 --> 01:27:00,180
I'm not too old to wear pink?

1109
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:01,537
No.

1110
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:11,081
I look like
a giant helium balloon.

1111
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,490
Come on. We have to go.

1112
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:18,922
I'm gonna walk over.

1113
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:23,126
I'll meet you there.

1114
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,158
Let's get Halley!

1115
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,057
Back seat.
I need to lie down.

1116
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:14,207
Please be seated.

1117
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:19,648
We have come together today
to join in Holy Matrimony

1118
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:23,054
Ashley Renee Martin
and Lewis Gibson Warsher II.

1119
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,985
If any among you know any reason

1120
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,551
why this couple
may not lawfully be married,

1121
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:31,120
declare it now
or forever hold your peace.

1122
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:45,874
Do you, Lewis, promise to love,
honor, and cherish Ashley

1123
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:48,916
from this day forward,
for richer or for poorer,

1124
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:50,974
in sickness and in health,

1125
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,748
forsaking all others
as long as you both shall live?

1126
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:55,152
I do.

1127
01:29:56,758 --> 01:30:00,421
And do you, Ashley, promise
to love, honor, and cherish Lewis

1128
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,190
for richer or for poorer,

1129
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:03,753
in sickness and in health,

1130
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:06,629
forsaking all others
as long as you both shall live?

1131
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:07,861
I do.

1132
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:09,095
The rings?

1133
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:20,979
Dear friends, let us ask God
to bless these rings

1134
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:23,539
as a symbol
of their love everlasting.

1135
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,313
No. No, the other finger.
That's right.

1136
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:29,879
Ashley, Lewis...
- She's having the baby.

1137
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:32,255
It is now my delight...
- Please be quiet.

1138
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:35,124
And honor to declare you
husband and wife.

1139
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:37,187
You may now kiss the bride.

1140
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:45,865
She's having the baby. Now.

1141
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:46,929
Right now?

1142
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,107
Scarlett's having the baby.
I have to go.

1143
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:53,511
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Scarlett's having the baby.

1144
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:18,961
Breathe.

1145
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:23,073
Wait, wait, wait! No.

1146
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,469
Shit!

1147
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:28,274
For heaven's sake.

1148
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:29,638
It's okay.

1149
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:32,075
You're gonna have the baby!

1150
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:36,583
Thank you so much. Thanks.

1151
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:39,717
You have got to do something.
That was just a dreadful scene.

1152
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:42,285
Now the seating arrangement's
gonna be a disaster.

1153
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:44,661
One empty seat
throws everything off.

1154
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:47,064
Mother, stop it. Okay?

1155
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:51,294
It doesn't get
any better than this.

1156
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:56,538
Squeeze my hand.
It's okay. We're gonna get there.

1157
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:06,582
I assume Daddy would like
to be in the delivery room?

1158
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,315
Me? No, no. L...

1159
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,380
Baby!
- Mommy!

1160
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:13,656
Hi, Sweetie.
- I need you.

1161
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:14,717
I'm her mother.

1162
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:17,925
Miss Smith?
- It's okay. Thank you.

1163
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:19,330
Don't leave me.

1164
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,777
So, do you hate me?

1165
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:46,357
Not you, per se.

1166
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:53,130
I hate the way
your hair falls in your face.

1167
01:32:56,103 --> 01:33:00,233
And I hate the way your voice
gets really low when you're serious.

1168
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:05,408
And I hate the way you bite
your bottom lip when you're nervous.

1169
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,411
And the way
your eyebrow goes... like that.

1170
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:12,741
I hate that.

1171
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:19,023
So, that's it?

1172
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:22,085
You just hate the way
I walk and talk and look?

1173
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,152
No.

1174
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:26,189
That Jedi mind trick thing?

1175
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:28,532
I hate that.

1176
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:30,968
Don't give up on me.

1177
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:32,369
I'm not.

1178
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:37,167
But you are gonna regret
ever having messed up.

1179
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:40,507
'Cause I'm gonna
make you pay for a long time.

1180
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:44,048
But first...

1181
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:49,016
You're going to take
three steps towards me.

1182
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,927
And you're going to wrap
your arms around my waist.

1183
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,965
And on the count of three...

1184
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:06,028
two...

1185
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:17,247
We're gonna dance.
