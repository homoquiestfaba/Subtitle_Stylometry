<b>THE LAST HEIST</b>

2
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,394
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:50,297
<i>You are listening
to KRCW Los Angeles,</i>

4
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,933
<i>news just in of a grisly
homicide in Redondo Beach.</i>

5
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:55,369
<i>Sonya Jacobson is
live at the scene.</i>

6
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,371
<i>That's right, Nick. I'm here at
Redondo Beach where the LAPD</i>

7
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:01,909
<i>are investigating the murder last
night of 22 year old Lisa Gonzales.</i>

8
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:03,778
<i>They're not confirming
any details,</i>

9
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,579
<i>but officers I've spoken
to are saying that it has</i>

10
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:07,982
<i>all the signs of a serial
murderer they're calling</i>

11
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:09,950
<i>"The Window Killer."</i>

12
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,886
<i>It would bring
his known tally of victims</i>

13
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,321
<i>in the Southland,
over the last two years, to 15.</i>

14
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:16,457
<i>That nickname, by the
way, is because he</i>

15
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,958
<i>takes his victims eyes
with him</i>

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,191
<i>as some kind of sick trophy.</i>

17
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:21,928
<i>I'm being told now that
the LAPD are going all out</i>

18
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,898
<i>to find this maniac as we
roll into the holiday weekend.</i>

19
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:36,009
What the fuck?

20
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:40,614
Civilian.

21
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,451
All right, everybody be cool.

22
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:07,008
What the fuck is this?

23
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,947
Geez, what the fuck
are you looking at?

24
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:18,819
Move on, asshole.

25
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:51,018
All clear.

26
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,487
Can I help you, sir?

27
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,423
I'm here to make a deposit.

28
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,493
Five minutes, folks.
Final weapons check.

29
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:34,962
Come on, man,
we did that already.

30
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:36,629
Then we'll do it again,
Echo Three.

31
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:39,466
It's a soft target.
There's no guards.

32
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,702
Skeleton staff,
handful of civilians.

33
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:44,103
Nobody is getting shot today.

34
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:47,641
So I want safeties on,
chambers empty.

35
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:49,709
We might as well go
in with squirt guns.

36
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:52,112
Hey, you know what? I've got
a butter knife in my pocket.

37
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,582
Tracey, chill the fuck out.

38
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,686
I'm afraid we're not
accepting deposits.

39
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,023
Actually, as you can see,
we're closing down.

40
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:04,491
Didn't you get our letter?

41
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:06,594
I don't get mail.

42
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:09,464
I see.

43
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,601
-What about her?
-She got our letter.

44
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:17,704
We've asked all our customers to
come in and empty out their boxes.

45
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,106
What if they don't?

46
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,275
Well, the feds come in
and they take everything

47
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:25,546
to a secret storage and
then they trace the owners.

48
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,981
I don't want that.

49
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,983
Most of our customers
feel the same way.

50
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,550
But it is procedure.

51
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:33,019
Why don't I take my stuff now?

52
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,154
Well, you would need
to have the letter.

53
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:39,592
-I told you.
-Yes, you don't get mail.

54
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:43,063
do you have ID?

55
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,634
I have this.

56
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:54,240
Well, Reverend,
I'll tell you what.

57
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:59,180
Come over to the counter
and I'll sort ya out.

58
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:05,219
We go hot in five minutes.

59
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:09,524
-Masks on.
-Somebody wake up Biggs.

60
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,294
Rock and roll.

61
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:21,202
OK, here you are.
You can have that back.

62
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:26,040
So... how long now?

63
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:27,608
Just a few moments.

64
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,642
I'm sorry again, Mrs. Waxman.

65
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:31,812
I know this has all
been very inconvenient.

66
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:34,847
I'm afraid that's not
good enough, young man.

67
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,784
I have had an account
here for 50 years.

68
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:41,154
That is no way to treat a
customer, closing down like this.

69
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,091
Well, times change, I'm afraid.
We're all very sad here.

70
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:48,661
Now, if you want to take a seat,
I'll call a cab to take you home.

71
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,699
Fuck you.

72
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,303
-Danny.
-Yes, sir.

73
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:00,373
The reverend would
like to empty his box.

74
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:02,142
Is he on the list?

75
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,078
He didn't get the letter.

76
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:07,647
But I processed him,
and he's set to go.

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,216
It's all very irregular.

78
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,720
But I suppose
it'll be all right.

79
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,622
You can take him back
as soon as I finish

80
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:15,822
-with Mrs. Gowan.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:18,791
I need to do this now.

82
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,661
As I'm sure has
been explained to you,

83
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,632
it's one at a time today.

84
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:27,701
So, if you don't mind
waiting your turn.

85
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:03,170
I'm sure you won't
mind if I go first.

86
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:09,410
Well, I've been here for
hours and I'm almost late

87
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,913
for my Pilates class, so...

88
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:25,258
OK.
If it's that important to you.

89
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:30,196
Are you sure?

90
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,403
Yeah.

91
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:47,246
You see?
She's happy that I go first.

92
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,185
OK. If you'll follow me,
I'll take you back.

93
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,459
After you, sir.

94
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:41,901
We really are in the
process of closing up,

95
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:45,539
so I am sorry about
the mess down here.

96
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:48,041
Watch your step here.

97
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:51,911
Been banking here long?

98
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,284
Nobody move.

99
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:33,486
Get your hands in the air.

100
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,957
Everybody stay
right where you are.

101
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,105
-Echo clear?
-Clear.

102
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:55,041
-Echo Three.
-Clear.

103
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,910
-Echo Two.
-Clear.

104
00:09:56,943 --> 00:10:00,381
-Echo One.
-All clear.

105
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,916
You know what this is.

106
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,451
There's nothing here for you.

107
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,921
We're closing down,
everything is gone.

108
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,424
Not everything.

109
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:11,924
You know who owns this place?

110
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,995
Of course we do,
that's half the fun.

111
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,572
Sit down.

112
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:30,643
What do you want
me to do about them?

113
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,979
I don't know.

114
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,080
Gonna behave?

115
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,882
Listen, young man.

116
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,483
I wish you'd get on with
whatever you're going to do

117
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:39,652
because I don't want
to sit here all day.

118
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,988
Yes, ma'am.
We'll be as quick as we can.

119
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,489
Cuff 'em.

120
00:10:43,522 --> 00:10:45,459
Hey, get your hands
off me, you bitch.

121
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:47,961
Are you fucking
talking to me, bitch?

122
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:49,930
-Where's your phone?
-I left it in my car.

123
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,366
Yeah?

124
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:55,935
OK.

125
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,004
One, two.

126
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:02,942
Listen, I've been tied up
by better people than you.

127
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:06,946
Christ, old lady,
it's not a fucking competition.

128
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:08,080
Where's your phone?

129
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:10,584
I haven't had one for years.

130
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:13,152
Jesus, living
in the Dark Ages.

131
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:15,187
I'm all set here.

132
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,923
Echo Five, is that everyone?

133
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,659
We're missing two, boss.
Two males.

134
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:22,396
Employee, civilian.

135
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,930
Where are they?

136
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:26,465
I don't know what you mean.

137
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:29,670
Stop wasting our fucking time.

138
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:35,174
Here, sir.

139
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:43,015
It's a little stuffy in here.

140
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:46,553
We switched off the
AC last week, so...

141
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:48,922
Do you have your key?

142
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,468
I've got it from here.

143
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:04,939
I'm supposed to stay with you.

144
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:12,612
My possessions
are very personal.

145
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:17,418
-I'd like privacy, please.
-I'm sorry.

146
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:19,987
It's procedure.

147
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:24,458
Stay here.

148
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:26,060
Sure.

149
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,035
What did I tell you?

150
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:37,504
This guy is messing with us.

151
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:39,772
Next one goes in your head.
Where are they?

152
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,709
In the back, in the vault.

153
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,471
Are you looking for me?

154
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,708
-Shit.
-What?

155
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:20,780
Sorry, Danny.

156
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,587
You weren't supposed to be here.

157
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:30,556
Paul? What the fuck, man?

158
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:32,758
Yeah, what the hell
is going on here?

159
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,595
Should I tell them?

160
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:39,599
This is my brother, Danny.

161
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,335
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

162
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:44,704
It's been a few years.

163
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,107
Yeah, I thought I'd
never see you again.

164
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,143
We took different paths.

165
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:52,679
Thought you had the day off.
Checked the rota.

166
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,280
Yeah, well, the
assistant manager got sick,

167
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:55,348
so I picked up for him.

168
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:56,817
Is everyone OK?
Mrs. Wax...

169
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:58,218
No.

170
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:00,554
I really need to go home.

171
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:02,588
Please help me.

172
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,224
Absolutely, I'm
sure we all would.

173
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,792
Look, this nice
little family reunion?

174
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:11,697
It's really fucking
touching, but now what Paul?

175
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,165
Nothing changes.

176
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,234
Stick to the plan,
we'll be gone in 10 minutes.

177
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:17,671
Everything's
fucking screwed up.

178
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:20,339
You took off your fucking mask.

179
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,843
Your face is gonna be all
over the 10 o'clock news,

180
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:25,112
and then how long before they
figure out who the fuck we are?

181
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:28,281
They shut off the
cameras last week.

182
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,617
Isn't that right?

183
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,888
You're welcome to leave.

184
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,658
And give up my share?
You'd like that.

185
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:43,763
Well, then I suggest that you
shut up and do your fucking job.

186
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,868
We're still
missing a guy, boss.

187
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:52,404
Any ideas, Danny?

188
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,307
He's in the vault.

189
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,709
OK.

190
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:56,877
Echo Three, get to the vault,

191
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,212
secure the guy, do your thing.

192
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:01,248
Echo Five, get some
cuffs on Danny here,

193
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:04,383
and then you and Echo Four
get everyone in the back room.

194
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,890
Stick to the plan, people,
and we're out in 10 minutes.

195
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,791
Walkies on channel six.

196
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:15,262
Hey, hey.
Don't worry.

197
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,197
When we're done here,
I'm taking care of business.

198
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:19,365
My way.

199
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,303
Hey, Paul.

200
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,445
Take a walk,
we're all set boss.

201
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,681
Get up, going on a walk.

202
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,829
Well, that was fun.

203
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:58,304
Guess we don't need
these things anymore?

204
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:13,786
Damn thing this, anyway.

205
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,689
Hoorah!

206
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:34,874
Come out, wherever you are.

207
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,466
In this room here.

208
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,903
Come on, pick up
your pace, let's go.

209
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:06,873
Now everybody
get on the floor.

210
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:10,876
-Down!
-Not you.

211
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,880
I cannot sit on the floor.

212
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:17,250
Will you get the
fucking old bat a chair?

213
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:22,756
All right, here you go.

214
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,758
You're a nice man, thank you.

215
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,495
-You're welcome.
-You're a real boy scout.

216
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,529
There's nothing wrong
with being decent to people.

217
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:33,065
-You should try it.
-Says the armed robber.

218
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:34,933
Shut up.

219
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,835
You.

220
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,371
Mate.

221
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:41,040
What's the story with
you and your brother?

222
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:42,976
You'd have to ask our
parents about that one.

223
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:47,479
You think you're
smart, don't you?

224
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:50,917
Yeah, with your stupid
fucking little tie,

225
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,819
and your stupid fucking hairdo.

226
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,524
But you're not going to feel
very smart when this is over.

227
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,358
What does that mean?

228
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,327
What she means is you won't
be leaving any witnesses.

229
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,396
What?

230
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,465
-The boss said...
-The boss?

231
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,400
The boss is a fucking wuss.

232
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:09,868
Tracey's gonna handle
things from here on out.

233
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:12,404
You just used her name, Allie.

234
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:16,575
Jesus.
I mean Echo Four.

235
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,812
Yeah, well, like the man said.

236
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:23,016
It really doesn't
matter, does it?

237
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:25,818
Happy?

238
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:29,421
Now sit the fuck down!

239
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:32,859
-I didn't sign up for this.
-Yeah?

240
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:37,029
Well, you just better figure
out whose side you're on.

241
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:40,934
This is bullshit
and you know it.

242
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:53,880
<i>Echo Three,
you in the vault yet?</i>

243
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:55,781
Yeah, I just got here. There's
no sign of the missing civilian.

244
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:57,417
What do you want me to
do, keep on looking?

245
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,119
No, we could search
this place forever.

246
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,086
We need to be out of here.
Just get the stuff.

247
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,956
Copy that.

248
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,016
Echo Six, status report.

249
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,652
<i>Echo Six, status report.</i>

250
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,856
Fuck.

251
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,927
All clear.

252
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:44,464
Echo Four, status report.

253
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,900
<i>We're having
a party back here.</i>

254
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,968
Geez, Echo Four.

255
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,436
<i>Geez your fucking self.</i>

256
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,603
<i>All secure, OK?</i>

257
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:54,206
Copy. All clear?

258
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,176
Quiet as the...

259
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,045
How much longer?

260
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:02,014
Not much longer if she's
as good as she says she is.

261
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,115
I don't know about
her girlfriend,

262
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:05,718
but she's pretty damn good.

263
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,687
How's it coming, Echo Three?

264
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,659
She's probably listening
to her dumb ass music.

265
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,928
Echo Three, pick up
your fucking radio.

266
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,563
Helps her focus.

267
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:20,632
<i>Echo Three,
fucking status report now.</i>

268
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:23,602
<i>Echo Three, status report.</i>

269
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:28,241
Want me to do it?

270
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:31,210
Not yet.

271
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:34,147
Echo Three, can you hear me?

272
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:46,124
Why the fuck is
she taking so long?

273
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:49,094
Maybe she isn't
so good, after all.

274
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:52,499
-Fuck you.
-Language.

275
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:55,101
I didn't know we were
at fucking Sunday school,

276
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,036
you old fucking prune.

277
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:59,705
Listen, you may be gangsters,
but at least you can

278
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:03,042
show some common decency.

279
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:04,677
Gangsters?

280
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,113
What the fuck is this, 1936?

281
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,081
Don't be a bitch.

282
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:11,683
Sorry.

283
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:12,719
I'm gonna smoke.

284
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:15,287
Not in here.

285
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,757
Jesus, woman.

286
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:28,133
Stay focused.

287
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,137
It's not like
they're going anywhere.

288
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,007
Come on.

289
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:37,287
I need your phone.

290
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:38,645
I don't know what
you're talking about.

291
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:41,247
Come on.
It's in your back pocket.

292
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,748
I'll give it right
back, come on.

293
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:45,251
OK, fine. Just hurry.

294
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:48,021
-What are you doing?
-I'm texting 911.

295
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,788
I didn't even know
you could do that.

296
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,690
What if they come back? You're
gonna get us all killed...

297
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:54,760
Would you shut up?
At least he's doing something.

298
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:57,229
You're supposed to
be the manager here.

299
00:21:57,263 --> 00:22:03,303
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Cohen,
but this is all very irregular.

300
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:06,038
All right,
let's get back in there.

301
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,543
Get a move on.

302
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,831
What?

303
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,335
Never mind.

304
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:50,549
Chicken and extra avocado.

305
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,219
Yeah, and you know what? Can you throw
in some extra chilis in there, too?

306
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:54,219
You like the chilis?

307
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:55,722
I like the chilis.

308
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:58,690
That'll be 15.20, please.

309
00:22:58,723 --> 00:23:00,359
15.20? You kidding me?

310
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:02,228
What did Wolfgang Puck

311
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,729
finally go into
the taco business?

312
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,231
Hey, puck off, lady.

313
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:07,033
I'm just trying to
make a living, man.

314
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:08,834
Hey, how about a little less
lady? It's Detective to you.

315
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:12,171
OK. Well, it's still 15.20
Detective, so why don't you

316
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:15,407
detect that money
while I get your order? Cool?

317
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,210
You're a fucking
comedian, aren't ya?

318
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:21,781
<i>One William Six,
One William Six.</i>

319
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:32,858
One William Six receiving.

320
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:36,362
<i>Possible 211 in progress
near your location.</i>

321
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:38,131
OK, got it.

322
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:39,565
I didn't even know
there was a bank there.

323
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:42,834
<i>It's a safety deposit vault,
it closed down two weeks ago.</i>

324
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,136
So who called it in, then?

325
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,772
<i>It was a text to 911.</i>

326
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,940
Are you kidding?
You can actually do that?

327
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:51,911
<i>You are directed to attend the
scene and evaluate the situation.</i>

328
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,749
You know what? Send the black and
white over and show me responding.

329
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:00,219
<i>Roger that. One William Six,
be aware this has been</i>

330
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:02,721
<i>assessed a prank call.</i>

331
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:06,860
OK, I'm on my way.
William Six out.

332
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,764
Hey, your burrito, Detective!

333
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:29,783
So, that's what
100,000,000 looks like.

334
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,335
I'm all done here.

335
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:52,205
<i>I've got the stuff.</i>

336
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:55,507
About fucking time.

337
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,243
Fuck you, too.

338
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:23,802
Put your hands where
I can see them.

339
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:30,209
Where the hell
did you come from?

340
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:36,014
Clever fucker.

341
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:38,283
Paul?

342
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:39,919
I found our missing civilian.

343
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,421
OK, I'm on my way.

344
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:45,892
Copy that.

345
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:51,530
You're not going to
tie me up, are you?

346
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:53,266
Hell no.

347
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:54,933
We're going to do this my way.

348
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,536
No witnesses.

349
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,870
You could just let me go home.

350
00:25:58,903 --> 00:26:02,074
-I have what I need.
-Yeah, what's in there?

351
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:05,577
Just some personal items.
Nothing of value to you.

352
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:08,882
I'll be the judge of that.

353
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:19,792
What the...

354
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:43,315
All call signs, heat.

355
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:44,916
<i>Say again, heat.</i>

356
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,420
<i>Say again, heat.</i>

357
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,421
Shit.

358
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:51,457
So, you're it?

359
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:53,325
Dispatch said it was a prank.

360
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,061
So, they sent me a couple
guys out of kindergarten?

361
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:58,564
Everyone's out looking
for that Windows guy.

362
00:26:58,596 --> 00:26:59,965
We got this.

363
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:02,067
You guys do
bachelorette parties? No?

364
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,436
Going in, cover me?

365
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:05,939
With pleasure, Detective.

366
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:10,576
Who the fuck are you?

367
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,422
Fuck.

368
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:24,591
Paul!

369
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,096
-What's going on?
-Boss.

370
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,968
We've got badges,
three of 'em.

371
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,638
Fucking hide, hide,
get out of here.

372
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,080
I just nicked
your radial artery.

373
00:27:49,113 --> 00:27:52,117
I estimate you have about
nine minutes to live.

374
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:54,553
If I were you,
I'd contemplate what

375
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:58,056
you want to do with
the rest of your life.

376
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:09,000
Good afternoon. I'm Detective
Pascal with the LAPD.

377
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,170
Got a report of a
robbery at this location.

378
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:14,172
A robbery?
That sounds serious.

379
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:15,507
And who might you be?

380
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,042
I'm the assistant manager.

381
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:20,412
As you can see,
this branch is closed.

382
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:22,448
We're just packing things up.

383
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,483
Nothing here to rob.

384
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,152
Jesus.

385
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:30,489
You're the fucking
Windows Killer.

386
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:31,957
Leave Jesus out of it.

387
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:41,267
Mother fucker.

388
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,101
Would you mind if we came
in and took a look around?

389
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:47,138
Company policy, sorry.
You'd need a warrant.

390
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:49,607
Well, not if there's
a crime in progress.

391
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,143
Well, like I said, there's
nothing going on here.

392
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:57,550
Yeah, the funny thing is, the call
came from inside this location.

393
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:00,987
Really? I don't see
how that could have happened.

394
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,454
Well, it was a text, so.

395
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:05,658
Then it could
have come from anywhere.

396
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,663
Yeah, but it's funny.
I'll just show you.

397
00:29:11,697 --> 00:29:13,032
See?

398
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,700
Hey.

399
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:17,202
Thanks for your cooperation.

400
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,042
Fuck.

401
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,184
See? I just severed your
femoral artery.

402
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:37,089
You have three, maybe
four minutes to live.

403
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:38,591
I'm no doctor.

404
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:44,630
Your heart is actually pumping
the blood out of your body.

405
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm not laughing at you.
I'm laughing with you.

406
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:51,770
This is a beautiful time.

407
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:54,040
These are the last
moments of your life.

408
00:29:54,073 --> 00:29:55,240
What does it feel like?

409
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:56,675
What does it feel like?

410
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,545
Do you feel the joy?

411
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:02,081
May I see?

412
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,182
May I see?

413
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:08,688
Guys. The cops are coming.

414
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:14,626
Shit. Guys?

415
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,529
Hey, respond.

416
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:19,599
Fuck.

417
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:33,579
Fuck me, boss,
you need to see this.

418
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:37,716
-Shit.
-How you doing?

419
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,250
Hey.

420
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,554
Looks like you missed a spot.

421
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:43,788
can I help you?

422
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,591
Get out of the van, sir.

423
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:48,794
-Look...
-Step out of the van.

424
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:50,728
Come on, please,
give me a break.

425
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,097
It's not a request.

426
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:52,832
Out of the van.

427
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:54,733
Shit, she made Rick.

428
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:12,351
Let me help you.

429
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,821
There you go.

430
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:27,600
You have the safety on.

431
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:30,669
Now try it.

432
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:41,814
-Freeze, freeze!
-Freeze!

433
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:46,184
No, no, no,
you fucking idiot.

434
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:56,629
Freeze.

435
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,641
Gun, gun.

436
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:22,155
Fucking cover me.

437
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:47,680
Go! Go, go!

438
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:52,383
-Cease fire.
-They're firing at us.

439
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,220
There's civilians inside.

440
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:56,222
He's not trying to
kill us, you morons.

441
00:32:56,255 --> 00:32:57,856
We'd already be dead.

442
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,325
Give me the radio.

443
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,694
This is One William Six.

444
00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:04,296
Shots fired at this location.

445
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:06,965
Officers need assistance.

446
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,936
Copy, clear.

447
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,841
You're gonna be OK, buddy.

448
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:22,915
Jesus.

449
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:26,252
-How's it look?
-Not good.

450
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:29,388
You're all right.

451
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,260
I can patch him up, but...

452
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:36,728
Yeah, I know.

453
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,900
<i>What's going on out there?
We heard shots.</i>

454
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:46,271
cops are here.

455
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:47,873
Christ.

456
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,743
It's OK, they're outside.

457
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,777
We're inside.
We planned for this.

458
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,413
Just chill.

459
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:56,382
Put your hand up.

460
00:33:56,415 --> 00:33:57,983
-Biggs.
-Yeah?

461
00:33:58,015 --> 00:33:59,985
It's time.

462
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:11,829
We're gonna need a stitch man.

463
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,433
There's lead in him.

464
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:16,035
They're not gonna stop
him from bleeding.

465
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,803
It'll be all right.

466
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,819
The eye is the
lamp of your body.

467
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:39,557
So, if the eye is healthy, your
whole body will be full of light.

468
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:45,397
But if the eye is bad, your whole
body will be full of darkness.

469
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,433
If then, the light
in you is darkness,

470
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:51,936
how great then, is the darkness?

471
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,825
I did the best I could do.

472
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:19,430
-He needs a hospital.
-Yeah, I know.

473
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:23,369
OK, you stay here.
Just keep watch.

474
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:26,538
If we start killing cops,
things will get messy.

475
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,575
Shit's already messy.

476
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:30,942
Yeah.

477
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:35,881
I'm gonna go to the vault
and sort this shit out.

478
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:02,375
Stop, Biggs.

479
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:07,446
You mother fuck.

480
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,549
We're getting jumpy back here.

481
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:12,451
What the hell is going on?

482
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:13,886
Cops.

483
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,087
They shot Rick.

484
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,188
What the fuck?

485
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,090
Somebody must
have made a call.

486
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,991
A call?

487
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:22,026
That fucking Danny.

488
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,462
I knew he was up to something.
I'm gonna kill him.

489
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:27,698
It's best not to, OK?
We need all the hostages.

490
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:31,937
For what? We're making a last
stand at the fucking Alamo here?

491
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,506
No, we need time.

492
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,140
Time? Time for what?

493
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:37,643
Biggs has got a plan.

494
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:40,078
I've always got a plan, AJ.

495
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,547
What's in your bag?

496
00:36:44,683 --> 00:36:46,652
What do you mean?

497
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:49,654
Wait, what about Tracey?
Did she get the stuff?

498
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,522
Better ask Paul.

499
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:53,192
He's looking into it.

500
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:55,160
Looking into what?

501
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:57,562
What the fuck, Biggs?

502
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:02,435
Screw this, we
should rush 'em.

503
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,002
Are you kidding?

504
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:06,671
-Well, we've got shotguns in the car.
-Yeah.

505
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:08,607
What, do you guys have
a death wish or something?

506
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,241
There's at least three guys
in there with M4's

507
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:12,176
who aren't afraid to use them,
and probably more inside.

508
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,513
Not to mention an unknown
number of hostages.

509
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:17,683
God, what did they teach you about
hostage situations at the academy?

510
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:20,618
-Deploy overwhelming force.
-Yeah.

511
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:22,754
You two don't look
so overwhelming.

512
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:24,189
So, what, we just sit
here and wait for backup?

513
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,790
Look, you guys
want to be useful?

514
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:26,624
Why don't you go
check the perimeter?

515
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,259
See if there's a
back way out of here.

516
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,961
You can handle this alone?

517
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:31,964
Probably feel a
little safer, actually.

518
00:37:31,997 --> 00:37:34,232
-OK, we're on it, Detective.
-Great.

519
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:46,678
This is Detective Pascal, robbery
homicide, badge number 5397.

520
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,455
<i>Go ahead.</i>

521
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:50,181
I'm gonna text you
a photo for facial ID.

522
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:51,682
<i>Copy that.</i>

523
00:37:51,716 --> 00:37:53,551
All right, thanks,
I'm sending now.

524
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:56,754
Who are you, mister?

525
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:47,805
What the fuck?

526
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:27,378
Jesus Christ.

527
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:29,747
All right, heads up, heads up,
everyone. I'm in the vault.

528
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,250
Tracey's dead.

529
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,852
What do you mean, Tracey's dead?

530
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:35,821
I mean, dead,
she's been fucking killed.

531
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:38,156
She's in the vault with me.

532
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:39,658
Who did it?

533
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,828
Best guess is it's
the guy we never found.

534
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:45,029
I think he's moving
around in the air vents.

535
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:46,731
Old place like this, there's
a whole network of them.

536
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:48,701
They're plenty big enough.

537
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:52,738
Well, then, let's go
fucking get him.

538
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,339
<i>Negative, Allie.</i>

539
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:56,774
We don't have time for
a wild goose chase.

540
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,276
He fucking killed Tracey.

541
00:39:58,308 --> 00:39:59,844
OK, well, we can get the guy,

542
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:01,712
or we can get out of here,
we can't do both.

543
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,214
I'm sorry,
but that's the choice.

544
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,782
Now that we know what
we're up against,

545
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:07,386
we can stop him if
he tries anything.

546
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,154
This is so fucked up.

547
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:12,123
We're bottled up
in a fucking bank.

548
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:14,825
-What about the stuff?
-Are you serious?

549
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:17,261
It's the fucking reason
we came here, isn't it?

550
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:19,730
I've got the stuff.

551
00:40:19,763 --> 00:40:21,633
Well, that's something.

552
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,935
So, now what?

553
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:26,171
<i>We go to plan B.
Biggs is already working on it.</i>

554
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,306
<i>Just need a couple hours.</i>

555
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:32,276
<i>In the meantime, stay frosty.</i>

556
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,147
<i>May only be one guy,
but he took down Tracey,</i>

557
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,181
<i>so he's no pussy.</i>

558
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:40,919
One more thing.

559
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:44,855
<i>He's handy with a knife,
and he's some kind of sicko.</i>

560
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:47,660
<i>Gauged out Tracey's eyes.</i>

561
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:05,843
Man, this just
keeps getting better.

562
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:08,714
What?

563
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:10,449
I need to go to the bathroom.

564
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:12,484
Well, you're just gonna
have to hold it, you old bag.

565
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:15,486
No, I mean, I really need
to go to the bathroom now.

566
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,723
What, you forget
your diapers, did you?

567
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:19,190
Bitch.

568
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:22,193
Come on, guys.
What harm can it do?

569
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:27,299
He's right. I think we're gonna
be here for a while.

570
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:28,866
Damn it.

571
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:31,469
Come on, Grandma Moses.

572
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:34,806
Where's the bathroom?

573
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:35,974
It's all the way down the hall.

574
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:37,875
Take a left.

575
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:42,281
Move it. Come on.

576
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:58,363
-Anything up?
-Just keeping my head down.

577
00:41:58,395 --> 00:42:01,399
-Anymore cops?
-Not yet.

578
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:05,337
Well, she'll call for backup,
so it will get busy soon enough.

579
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,239
Shit's really
fucked up, ain't it?

580
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:08,907
Yeah.

581
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:10,841
But we still gonna
get out of here, right?

582
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,777
Yeah, that's the plan.

583
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:16,013
What?

584
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,350
Were you two separated
at birth or something?

585
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:20,986
Nope.
We're actually really close.

586
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:23,955
We grew up together.
Happy family.

587
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,457
So, what happened?

588
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,859
-We joined the military.
-Same unit?

589
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:32,897
No, we deployed at the same
time, but I was in the core.

590
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:34,866
Danny, he was always better
than me at everything,

591
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:36,868
so he ended up in the Rangers.

592
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:39,337
What, you go in as brothers
and come out as what?

593
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,404
Enemies?

594
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:41,872
I don't want to talk about it.

595
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:43,041
Come on, man.

596
00:42:43,073 --> 00:42:45,276
We ain't got nothing better
to do for the next hour or so.

597
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,812
Go ahead, humor me.

598
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:48,078
Other than dodge
a fucking psycho

599
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:49,980
serial killer on the loose?

600
00:42:50,013 --> 00:42:53,384
Yeah, there's that.

601
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:00,492
Wait, this is the men's room.

602
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:05,029
So take a fucking
dump in the urinal. Fucking bag.

603
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:08,866
Thank you, bitch.

604
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:27,352
Well, we both saw some
pretty fucked up shit.

605
00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:31,055
At least, I know I did, and I think
Danny had the same, maybe worse.

606
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:34,593
We both came back in
one piece, but you know,

607
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,328
something like
that changes a man.

608
00:43:36,361 --> 00:43:38,462
Lot of vets are really
fucked up in the head.

609
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:40,931
Me, I just learned that
life is short and crappy,

610
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:43,934
and you gotta take what you
can while you can, you know?

611
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:46,004
Hence the life of crime.

612
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:47,471
Yeah.

613
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:49,106
And your brother?

614
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,042
I guess after all
the mayhem and chaos,

615
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:53,611
he just wanted something
with structure in his life.

616
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:55,447
A little bit of order.

617
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,084
Did he know?
About you, before today?

618
00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:02,120
No, no, I don't...
Nah, not really.

619
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:04,955
He knew I fell off the map.

620
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:06,992
So, let me get this straight.

621
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:10,561
While we out here doing all
this felonious bullshit,

622
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:15,100
your brother playing superhero
holding back the tides of chaos.

623
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:17,102
I never pegged you
for a philosopher,

624
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:21,038
but yeah, I guess, I guess we're
two sides of the same coin.

625
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:36,889
Time's up, old woman.

626
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:44,962
For fuck, I'm coming in.

627
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,944
Having a few problems, are ya?

628
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:12,089
Fuck.

629
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:39,450
I'm coming in,
you son of a bitch.

630
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:18,088
Come on, Allie, what the fuck?

631
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:19,723
I don't think
they're coming back.

632
00:46:19,756 --> 00:46:22,994
Shut the fuck up.

633
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:27,598
They've been gone a long time.

634
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,633
Something's moving
around up there.

635
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,201
You don't know shit.

636
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:33,103
I know you need to keep
your eye on that vent.

637
00:46:33,136 --> 00:46:34,772
I know you need to
shut your fucking mouth

638
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:37,108
and let me handle this, OK?

639
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,744
Just trying to help.

640
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:49,021
Boss.

641
00:47:06,636 --> 00:47:08,774
They're everywhere.

642
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:34,299
So it begins.

643
00:47:34,332 --> 00:47:37,201
Biggs, update.

644
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:41,138
I'm about done here,
machine room's next.

645
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:42,373
Time.

646
00:47:42,406 --> 00:47:44,743
I'll know when I get there.

647
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:49,781
Took you long enough.

648
00:47:49,814 --> 00:47:52,317
Yeah, we had to
stop for donuts.

649
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:55,152
So, what do we got, Detective?

650
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:58,189
Well, we've got multiple
perps with automatic weapons.

651
00:47:58,221 --> 00:47:59,723
They know how to use
them, too, so I'm thinking

652
00:47:59,756 --> 00:48:01,758
it's some kind of
military background.

653
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:04,828
-Possible hostages.
-Any comms?

654
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:06,830
No, not yet, but I
did talk to one of 'em.

655
00:48:06,864 --> 00:48:08,233
Yeah, I know.

656
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:09,867
That photo you
e-mailed really got 'em

657
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:11,603
excited at headquarters.

658
00:48:11,636 --> 00:48:15,607
Feds are taking a big
interest in these guys.

659
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,174
What are they doing here?

660
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:19,643
AJ, Allie, update.

661
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:23,214
This is AJ.

662
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:26,350
-What is it?
-Allie's gone, man.

663
00:48:26,384 --> 00:48:27,752
What do you mean, gone?

664
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:30,254
She took the old
lady to the bathroom,

665
00:48:30,288 --> 00:48:32,891
<i>down the hall,
and she never came back.</i>

666
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:35,259
Now you're telling me.

667
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,395
Hey, guys.

668
00:48:38,428 --> 00:48:41,232
I think you're gonna want to
come in here and listen to this.

669
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:46,870
So, I've been scanning frequencies,
in case they're using radios.

670
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:50,408
-Put it on speaker.
-Yep, OK.

671
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:53,710
<i>OK, AJ, sit tight.</i>

672
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:56,247
<i>We're getting out of here,
we'll find Allie after, OK?</i>

673
00:48:56,279 --> 00:48:58,682
<i>Sit tight? We're being
picked off like flies here.</i>

674
00:48:58,716 --> 00:49:00,317
<i>We've got to do something.</i>

675
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,718
Like what?

676
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,321
There are four of us
and one of him.

677
00:49:03,353 --> 00:49:04,689
We've got automatic weapons.

678
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:06,390
He's got a fucking knife.

679
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:09,794
<i>Be patient, AJ.
This will all be over soon.</i>

680
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:12,763
<i>All right, but if
he does one more thing,</i>

681
00:49:12,797 --> 00:49:15,900
<i>if anything else happens,
I'm going after him.</i>

682
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:19,337
<i>I mean, the eyes, man?
It's fucking disgusting.</i>

683
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,738
You don't think...

684
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,440
This is LA, nothing
shocks me anymore.

685
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:39,857
I guess it's time
to talk to the cops.

686
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:43,861
Hey, Detective.

687
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:47,731
What's this?

688
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:51,402
Looks like you need to go
and talk to him, Detective.

689
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:53,438
Last time that
didn't go so well.

690
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:57,342
Well, then, it sounds like
you've already got a rapport.

691
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:04,915
-You surrendering?
-We need to talk.

692
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:07,418
I'm unarmed.

693
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,259
All right.

694
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,960
So, why don't you tell me
what the hell's going on here?

695
00:50:16,993 --> 00:50:18,997
We got hostages.

696
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,498
How many?

697
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:23,701
Well, I can't tell you that.

698
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:25,903
How many of you?

699
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:27,337
I can't tell you that, either.

700
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,373
Well, that's great.

701
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:32,442
Quite the turnout
you've got here.

702
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:34,311
Yeah, when the LAPD gets
its head out of its ass,

703
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:36,747
we throw a real good party.

704
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,551
So, we have demands.

705
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,921
I'm sure you do.

706
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:47,357
I'll play. 747 at LAX?

707
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,559
Space shuttle, maybe.

708
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,029
Just a school bus.

709
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:53,897
And a medic for my guy.
You have two hours.

710
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:58,369
-School bus. Where to?
-Well, I can't tell you that.

711
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:01,473
No, of course you
can't tell me that.

712
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:04,075
So, what happens if we don't?

713
00:51:04,107 --> 00:51:08,046
Then we start
shooting hostages.

714
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:10,480
Yeah, I don't really
think you're the type.

715
00:51:10,513 --> 00:51:12,916
You don't know my type.

716
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,819
I'm guessing you served.

717
00:51:15,852 --> 00:51:18,822
Core. You?

718
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:21,792
My husband.

719
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:26,396
He didn't come back.

720
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,500
IED out of Baghdad.

721
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:31,803
I'm sorry.

722
00:51:31,835 --> 00:51:35,406
Which is why I don't understand why
guys like you do bullshit like this.

723
00:51:35,439 --> 00:51:38,942
I mean, you made it back.

724
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:42,513
You should be doing
something good.

725
00:51:42,546 --> 00:51:45,450
We all have our reasons.

726
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:47,484
-I'm sorry about your friend.
-Yeah.

727
00:51:47,518 --> 00:51:49,120
I'll work on
getting you a medic.

728
00:51:49,152 --> 00:51:52,622
-Thank you. What about the bus?
-What do we get?

729
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:57,094
Well, you give me the medic,
I'll start releasing hostages.

730
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:59,930
Fair enough.

731
00:51:59,964 --> 00:52:02,866
I'm gonna go back inside now.

732
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:08,105
Semper fi, Detective.

733
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,484
Biggs, status update.

734
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:28,459
-It's gonna be a few minutes.
-All right.

735
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:29,960
We need to get the
hostages ready.

736
00:52:29,993 --> 00:52:31,863
Go help AJ bring them down.

737
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:33,430
What about Allie?

738
00:52:33,464 --> 00:52:36,534
Hostages first,
then we look for Allie.

739
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:39,938
OK. Hostages first.

740
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,647
Hey, Detective,
we're out back.

741
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,015
But there's no doors,
just a window.

742
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:54,018
Is it big enough
to get through?

743
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:56,520
I'm sure we could work it out.

744
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:58,622
You know what?
You guys stay there.

745
00:52:58,656 --> 00:53:00,525
If this thing goes off,
you might need to go inside.

746
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:01,893
Roger.

747
00:53:01,926 --> 00:53:03,494
-AJ.
-In here.

748
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:04,495
Get them on their feet.

749
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:05,962
Up, let's go.

750
00:53:05,995 --> 00:53:08,665
Come on, move, let's go
for a walk. Let's go.

751
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,001
No ideas, OK?

752
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:12,904
I guess you talked
to Paul about me?

753
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:15,706
Yeah, well, we're not the same.

754
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:17,507
Yeah, I got that. You were with
the Rangers, right?

755
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:17,957
Once.

756
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:19,209
Yeah, so you got that
field medical training.

757
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:22,447
-You can stitch, right?
-Sure, but...

758
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,048
So, when I get your
ass downstairs, you gonna

759
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,185
-take care of my boy, right?
-Gunshot?

760
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:31,221
You gonna take care
of my boy Rick or not?

761
00:53:31,254 --> 00:53:34,191
-You got a trauma bag?
-I got a first aid kit.

762
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:36,060
Well, then he needs a hospital.
There's nothing I can do.

763
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:38,663
See, that's the wrong answer.
When I get your ass downstairs,

764
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:40,631
you're gonna take
care of my boy Rick.

765
00:53:40,663 --> 00:53:42,499
You're gonna stabilize him.

766
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:44,569
Now, they sending in a medic,
and that's what you're gonna do.

767
00:53:44,602 --> 00:53:47,071
Let's go. Move.

768
00:53:47,103 --> 00:53:50,006
Let's go. AJ.

769
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,509
The medic I get, but the bus?

770
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:55,078
Yeah. Seems too simple.

771
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,080
What's your take?

772
00:53:58,114 --> 00:53:59,683
I think they're
up to something.

773
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:01,551
I just get the feeling
we're about to be had.

774
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:03,688
You know?

775
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:08,526
Who's this?

776
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:11,696
Looks like the feds
are crashing our party.

777
00:54:24,674 --> 00:54:27,245
Captain Franklin.

778
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,147
This is Detective Pascal,
she's first on the scene.

779
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,716
I'm Sinclair, this is Chen.

780
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:33,683
These two, Smith and Jones.

781
00:54:33,716 --> 00:54:34,985
Well, are the others coming?

782
00:54:35,018 --> 00:54:37,120
We're it. One team, one crisis.

783
00:54:37,154 --> 00:54:40,024
-That's not SWAT protocol.
-We're not SWAT.

784
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:42,692
-Then who the fuck are you?
-Detective.

785
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:45,595
-DOD.
-Contractors?

786
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:47,230
What the hell happened to SWAT?

787
00:54:47,263 --> 00:54:51,067
SWAT is who cops like you call
when you get into trouble.

788
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,671
Who do you think SWAT calls?

789
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:56,106
I just smell the
testosterone from here.

790
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,676
-Let me tell you what we got...
-I know what you got.

791
00:54:58,709 --> 00:55:00,645
You got him.

792
00:55:01,712 --> 00:55:03,047
You know him?

793
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,681
Been chasing him for years.

794
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:06,082
When your detective
sent the photo through

795
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:07,752
for ID, all the lights went red.

796
00:55:07,785 --> 00:55:09,219
So here we are.

797
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:11,689
All right, Chen, you go up high.

798
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:15,026
-Up there should be good.
-All right, Chief.

799
00:55:15,058 --> 00:55:17,294
-Smith, you're it.
-Two minutes.

800
00:55:17,328 --> 00:55:19,096
Jones, you're with me.

801
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,165
So, what is a master criminal

802
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:22,799
doing in a rinky dink
dump like this?

803
00:55:22,832 --> 00:55:24,234
I mean the place isn't
even open anymore.

804
00:55:24,268 --> 00:55:27,038
You don't know, do ya?

805
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:28,400
There's 100,000,000
in bearer bonds

806
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:30,775
in the safety deposit box,
it's cartel money.

807
00:55:30,808 --> 00:55:33,244
Doesn't sound like
a cartel operation.

808
00:55:33,277 --> 00:55:38,282
It's not. Our guy has been making
a career ripping off the cartel.

809
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:41,318
Must have a death wish
or something.

810
00:55:41,352 --> 00:55:43,054
Anyway, this should have
been an easy job for him.

811
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:45,156
Something must have
gone wrong inside.

812
00:55:45,189 --> 00:55:48,192
-Our lucky day.
-Yeah, about that.

813
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:50,828
-There's been a development.
-I'm listening.

814
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:53,263
There's a possibility
there's a wanted serial killer,

815
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:56,601
Windows,
operating on the inside.

816
00:55:56,634 --> 00:55:59,603
Sounds like he's taken out
a couple of your man's crew.

817
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:00,870
And you know this for sure?

818
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:03,107
We intercepted
their radio traffic.

819
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,674
Ready to go, Chief.

820
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:05,742
We heard they
want a medic inside.

821
00:56:05,776 --> 00:56:06,810
Smith's going in.

822
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:08,144
Now, wait just a minute.

823
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:10,848
This man is wanted by the LAPD.

824
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:13,116
That makes this
an LAPD operation.

825
00:56:13,149 --> 00:56:16,620
I'm not gonna stand here and argue
jurisdiction with you, Captain.

826
00:56:16,654 --> 00:56:18,356
You don't have positive
confirmation that this

827
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:20,857
Windows guy is even in
there, and the radio calls

828
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:23,827
you heard could be
deliberate misinformation.

829
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:26,830
What I know for sure is that
there's a very dangerous

830
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:29,367
armed criminal inside,
and your men do not have

831
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:31,768
the training or
equipment to take him on.

832
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:36,207
We do. You got a problem,
take it up the chain of command.

833
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,142
Until then,
this is our operation.

834
00:56:38,174 --> 00:56:39,877
Clear?

835
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,149
Fine. Have it your way.

836
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:48,386
But this is still
a joint operation.

837
00:56:48,419 --> 00:56:52,357
Detective Pascal
will act as liaison.

838
00:56:53,756 --> 00:56:55,358
Get me headquarters.

839
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:58,296
Welcome aboard, Detective.

840
00:57:02,732 --> 00:57:05,435
Move. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

841
00:57:05,468 --> 00:57:07,737
Let's go, let's go,
come on, come on.

842
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,173
Move, move, move.

843
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:13,444
Not you, you and me.

844
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:15,879
-Go.
-Sit down. Don't fucking move.

845
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:19,784
There he is, he's over there.
Stitch.

846
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,690
Washington.

847
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,761
It's Sinclair.

848
00:57:31,794 --> 00:57:33,763
Must have been the picture
the detective took.

849
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,266
Shit's about to
get interesting.

850
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:36,934
Yeah.

851
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:38,768
So, what's the plan?

852
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:42,172
Smith will go in as a medic.
And get intel.

853
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:45,442
Chen will take over watch
and shoot out bad guys,

854
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:46,843
once he gets a clean shot.

855
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:48,913
Jones and me will breach.

856
00:57:48,946 --> 00:57:50,381
What about the hostages?

857
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:52,248
We don't know that
there are any hostages.

858
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:54,184
Smith will tell us.

859
00:57:54,218 --> 00:57:55,920
But it doesn't matter a whole
damn. We're gonna breach anyway.

860
00:57:55,953 --> 00:57:58,422
This is pretty much the
worst idea I've ever heard.

861
00:57:58,455 --> 00:58:00,357
It's gonna be a
bloodbath in there.

862
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,759
You're playing with the
big boys now, Detective.

863
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:04,294
This is how we roll.

864
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:08,232
Whatever happens in there,
is on you.

865
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,468
Damn right it is.

866
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,769
What happens if Windows
is actually in there?

867
00:58:12,803 --> 00:58:14,505
Then we'll take him down, too.

868
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:18,743
-He's our caller.
-I'm going in with you.

869
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:23,313
Then you better get
a vest on, Detective.

870
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:36,826
Sorry about this, man.

871
00:58:36,859 --> 00:58:39,863
You should have thought
about that sooner.

872
00:58:39,897 --> 00:58:41,031
Best laid plans.

873
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:44,902
Boss, you might
want to come see this.

874
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:53,911
Here we go.

875
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:01,384
Put your hands behind your back.

876
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,953
Put your hands behind your back.

877
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:04,988
You are?

878
00:59:05,022 --> 00:59:07,458
-The medic you asked for.
-No, you're not.

879
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:08,926
You're Sinclair's guy.

880
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:12,562
AJ, take this medic
to the back room.

881
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:14,498
-You don't understand.
-Yeah, I do.

882
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:16,400
We've all read the same manual.

883
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:19,003
Get upstairs,
fuckface, let's go.

884
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:21,872
-Move!
-Move!

885
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:25,777
Hurry up, asshole.

886
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:30,814
So, what's the
next play, Danny?

887
00:59:30,848 --> 00:59:32,315
Why should I care?

888
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:34,417
Come on, you used to
be good at this stuff.

889
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:38,055
They're gonna breach.

890
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:40,290
They'd have sent a real
medic otherwise, man.

891
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:42,892
Yeah.

892
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:45,395
-We need to get him up.
-He's barely breathing.

893
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:47,964
He's better off out
there than he is in here.

894
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:52,902
-Hey.
-Looks like you're going home.

895
00:59:52,935 --> 00:59:54,904
-Come on.
-I got you Rick.

896
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:56,807
Come on, come on.

897
00:59:57,607 --> 00:59:59,609
There you go.

898
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,345
You OK?

899
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:04,114
Hold him steady.

900
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:06,450
You take care of him.

901
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:08,852
All right, come on.

902
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:14,926
Hey, Captain,
we got you some hostages.

903
01:00:16,627 --> 01:00:20,832
Team two, go get 'em.
Everyone else cover.

904
01:00:31,174 --> 01:00:34,312
-What about me?
-No, you we need.

905
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:43,120
Biggs!

906
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:57,201
<i>Now's your
time to shine, boys.</i>

907
01:00:57,234 --> 01:01:00,004
I want you to go in the back
and tell me what you can see.

908
01:01:00,036 --> 01:01:02,672
Yeah, we're on it, Detective,
but what if we make contact?

909
01:01:02,705 --> 01:01:04,140
Observe and report only.

910
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:06,110
Do not engage these guys,
do you hear me?

911
01:01:06,143 --> 01:01:07,645
Observe and report, my ass.

912
01:01:07,678 --> 01:01:09,946
Fuck that, we're going in.

913
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,949
-All right.
-Get down.

914
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:13,384
One, two.

915
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:15,953
This room.
Now, you listen carefully.

916
01:01:15,986 --> 01:01:18,589
You want to live?
You do everything I say.

917
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:19,989
Yeah, yeah, tough guy.

918
01:01:20,022 --> 01:01:21,925
Shut the fuck up
and stand right there.

919
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:25,194
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you.

920
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,530
You do everything I tell you
and you won't get killed.

921
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:30,567
Sit down. Move!

922
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:47,384
How you doing up there, Chen?

923
01:01:48,185 --> 01:01:50,154
Found my spot.
Setting up now.

924
01:01:50,187 --> 01:01:53,089
Copy, let me know
when you're ready.

925
01:01:55,024 --> 01:01:57,026
I could kill you
with my fucking teeth.

926
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:01,198
That's great, because I can
kill you with my fucking gun.

927
01:02:14,176 --> 01:02:15,512
Hey.

928
01:02:16,712 --> 01:02:18,682
On your knees.

929
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:20,584
Hello.

930
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,151
I said, "on your
knees," asshole.

931
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:24,455
I just need a
moment of your time.

932
01:02:24,488 --> 01:02:26,589
Take one more
step and you die.

933
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:28,625
OK.

934
01:02:33,596 --> 01:02:36,165
-You killed my friends.
-I saved them.

935
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:40,470
-You cut out their eyes.
-I just want to go home.

936
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:43,174
You should leave me alone.

937
01:02:45,107 --> 01:02:46,477
Found an X-ray.

938
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:47,745
Good shot.

939
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:49,747
Stand by.

940
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,584
-You good?
-Let's go.

941
01:03:07,064 --> 01:03:09,533
What have we got here?

942
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:38,261
What's taking him so long?

943
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:39,695
Biggs, tick tock.

944
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:41,799
<i>Two minutes.</i>

945
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:57,748
Yes.

946
01:03:59,116 --> 01:04:02,753
All systems go, boss.
All systems go.

947
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:08,625
-I should kill you right now.
-Why don't you?

948
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:11,761
I'm not a murderer.
I'm not like you.

949
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:14,097
We're all the
same in God's eyes.

950
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:16,667
Just fucking shoot him!

951
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,102
I'll be with you in a minute.

952
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:19,703
-Shut up.
-Come on!

953
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:22,339
Shut the fuck up.

954
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:25,709
It took me a long
time to understand

955
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,310
that we're all the same.

956
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:31,581
The street punk, the
professional, like you.

957
01:04:31,614 --> 01:04:35,886
The cop, the banker.
We're all the same.

958
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:38,122
Sinners.

959
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:39,656
And then God spoke to me.

960
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:43,759
Yeah?
What's He sound like?

961
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:45,796
You wouldn't understand.

962
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:51,234
It was like I suddenly
knew what I had to do.

963
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:54,705
You're fucking crazy.

964
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:58,576
I've been told so.

965
01:04:59,776 --> 01:05:01,310
But you know what?

966
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:04,847
Maybe I'm the only
one who isn't crazy.

967
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:06,649
Did you think about that?

968
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:11,355
When God spoke to me,
He told me to save souls.

969
01:05:11,388 --> 01:05:13,723
As many as I could.

970
01:05:13,756 --> 01:05:15,358
Does that sound like
a bad thing to do?

971
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:18,629
God told you to cut
people's fucking eyes out?

972
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:21,265
Couldn't just preach,
join a fucking church?

973
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:26,169
He told me the eyes were
the windows of the soul.

974
01:05:26,203 --> 01:05:30,174
And it was my destiny
to collect souls.

975
01:05:30,207 --> 01:05:31,341
You see?

976
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:34,410
It's very simple.

977
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:38,881
God just spoke to me.

978
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:40,784
About fucking time.

979
01:05:42,419 --> 01:05:44,254
X-Ray's about to
execute a hostage.

980
01:05:44,286 --> 01:05:47,256
Green light, repeat,
green light.

981
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:53,197
Say hello to Tracey for me.

982
01:06:03,439 --> 01:06:07,644
God protects
those who serve Him.

983
01:06:13,984 --> 01:06:17,788
I just need
a moment of your time.

984
01:06:19,522 --> 01:06:21,692
X-ray down, X-ray down.

985
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:24,328
Time to saddle up.

986
01:06:24,361 --> 01:06:25,962
Keep your men outside,
whatever happens.

987
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:27,030
I don't know about this...

988
01:06:27,064 --> 01:06:28,832
Listen, it's gonna be
crazy enough without your men

989
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:30,267
blundering around.

990
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:31,868
Just stay out of our way.

991
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,837
All right, but if
things start going south,

992
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,404
we're coming in.

993
01:06:35,437 --> 01:06:38,774
Fair enough.
Ready?

994
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:40,777
Showtime.

995
01:07:08,772 --> 01:07:10,306
Go.

996
01:07:31,393 --> 01:07:32,462
Fuck you.

997
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:50,980
Hey, Paul.
You still with us?

998
01:07:51,013 --> 01:07:52,915
That you, Sinclair?

999
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:54,517
You know this guy?

1000
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:56,053
We go back a long way.

1001
01:07:56,085 --> 01:07:58,354
So, our mutual friends
and I were wondering,

1002
01:07:58,388 --> 01:08:00,357
did you get the stuff?

1003
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:02,526
I got it.

1004
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,361
It's right there on the counter.

1005
01:08:04,394 --> 01:08:05,996
So, it is.

1006
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:07,863
Doesn't look like much.

1007
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:09,433
Well, it's all there.

1008
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:11,334
Shame you won't
get to spend it.

1009
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:13,469
And you will, Sinclair?

1010
01:08:13,502 --> 01:08:14,970
You bring up a good point.

1011
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:16,506
I don't think they'll miss it.

1012
01:08:16,538 --> 01:08:18,809
What's going on, Sinclair?

1013
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:22,411
Just one of those macho moments
you like so much, Detective.

1014
01:08:22,444 --> 01:08:25,948
So, Paul, you know, the boys
aren't too happy with you.

1015
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:28,051
Fifth time you've
ripped them off.

1016
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:29,853
Sixth, actually.

1017
01:08:29,885 --> 01:08:32,421
Trenton, that was you.

1018
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:34,591
We get around.

1019
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,328
That's enough.

1020
01:08:38,495 --> 01:08:39,895
Really?

1021
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:41,398
'Til I figure out what
the hell's going on,

1022
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:42,933
you're under arrest.

1023
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:44,968
I can see the wheels
turning, Detective.

1024
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:46,870
So, let me guess,
you're not really DOD?

1025
01:08:46,903 --> 01:08:50,440
He's cartel, if you hadn't
already figured it out.

1026
01:08:50,473 --> 01:08:52,109
Is that true?

1027
01:08:52,142 --> 01:08:55,612
It's a gray area, but at least
you nailed a dangerous criminal.

1028
01:08:55,644 --> 01:08:57,546
We only realized what was
going on when you sent

1029
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,584
that photo through,
so thanks for that, Detective.

1030
01:09:00,617 --> 01:09:02,519
You're welcome.

1031
01:09:15,931 --> 01:09:17,501
Jesus.

1032
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:22,538
-What did you say?
-He said, "Run."

1033
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:31,081
Looks like the
Calvary's arrived.

1034
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:32,482
Hey, Detective.

1035
01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:35,017
Just in time, boys.

1036
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,553
Like I told your
boss, Detective.

1037
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:39,022
Stay out of our way.
Jones.

1038
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:53,502
Over here.

1039
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:04,514
-Don't be an idiot.
-Easy for you to say.

1040
01:10:04,546 --> 01:10:06,482
You don't have a fucking family.

1041
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:16,960
Drop it.

1042
01:10:17,227 --> 01:10:19,196
Drop it.

1043
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:23,132
We can all get
something out of this.

1044
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:27,571
We'll just say Paul got
away with the money.

1045
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:30,607
We'll split it three ways, it will be
a pretty good payday for all of us.

1046
01:10:30,639 --> 01:10:33,209
Good luck spending
it in Folsom, asshole.

1047
01:10:33,242 --> 01:10:34,678
It was just a thought.

1048
01:10:34,711 --> 01:10:37,481
I wouldn't worry
about me, Detective.

1049
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,189
Give it up, Paul. There's
two of us and one of you.

1050
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:49,993
It's time, don't you think?

1051
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,464
You know he's right.

1052
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:01,604
Fuck.

1053
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,116
Well, you nearly did it.

1054
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:14,584
Yeah.

1055
01:11:14,617 --> 01:11:15,785
Ten minutes, in and out.

1056
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:18,255
It was supposed to be
the easy one.

1057
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:20,656
Place like this, I didn't
think they'd miss it.

1058
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:22,224
What was the back-up?
The elevator?

1059
01:11:22,257 --> 01:11:24,227
How did you know about that?

1060
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,062
I'm not an idiot, Paul.

1061
01:11:26,095 --> 01:11:28,231
I read the building plans.

1062
01:11:28,264 --> 01:11:30,065
But you got it working?

1063
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:32,702
Yeah, they bricked it up,
but they left everything there.

1064
01:11:32,734 --> 01:11:34,036
Smart.

1065
01:11:34,069 --> 01:11:36,206
Not smart enough, obviously.

1066
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:38,607
No, sorry, Paul.

1067
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:41,711
Paul?! Paul!

1068
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:48,652
So, this is it?

1069
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:50,252
Yeah, worth the trouble,
don't you think?

1070
01:11:50,286 --> 01:11:52,154
Yeah.

1071
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:53,323
Sorry about your brother.

1072
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:55,090
Go fuck yourself.

1073
01:11:55,123 --> 01:11:58,161
I'm starting to see
the family resemblance.

1074
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,828
What are we gonna do with you?

1075
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:02,165
If you're doing what
I think you're gonna do,

1076
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:03,732
I'm the least of your problems.

1077
01:12:03,765 --> 01:12:06,635
But you can't be too careful.
Chen.

1078
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:32,261
I'm here, I'm here.

1079
01:12:40,303 --> 01:12:44,640
It was always...

1080
01:13:07,162 --> 01:13:09,765
What the fuck?

1081
01:13:13,403 --> 01:13:14,704
Are you OK?

1082
01:13:14,737 --> 01:13:17,174
I've been better.

1083
01:13:18,407 --> 01:13:20,743
I got this, Detective.

1084
01:13:24,846 --> 01:13:26,782
Do me a favor.

1085
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:33,289
Go put a bullet in him.

1086
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:35,826
Absolutely.

1087
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,929
What the fuck?

1088
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:51,835
Danny, is that fucking you?

1089
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:54,236
Don't fuck with me, Danny.

1090
01:15:14,055 --> 01:15:15,725
Danny?

1091
01:15:25,535 --> 01:15:27,738
Danny.

1092
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:34,277
Hey.

1093
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:36,412
Who the hell are you?

1094
01:15:42,919 --> 01:15:45,255
You're that fucking Windows guy.

1095
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:47,991
I just want to go home.

1096
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:51,560
I saw what you did to my men.

1097
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:53,529
You should leave me alone.

1098
01:15:53,563 --> 01:15:56,800
Yeah?

1099
01:15:56,832 --> 01:16:01,270
Well, I think I'm
gonna do LAPD a favor.

1100
01:16:01,304 --> 01:16:05,007
Please.
Allow me to explain.

1101
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:47,109
The eye is the
lamp of the body.

1102
01:17:47,143 --> 01:17:51,080
The lamp of the body.

1103
01:17:51,112 --> 01:17:55,084
So, if your eye
is healthy, your...

1104
01:18:30,486 --> 01:18:32,421
Stop right there.

1105
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:36,192
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

1106
01:18:43,032 --> 01:18:45,702
Looks like you and me had
a pretty bad day, Danny.

1107
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:49,438
That Windows guy is a
bit of a handful?

1108
01:18:49,471 --> 01:18:51,206
Yeah, not anymore.

1109
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:54,944
Good for you.

1110
01:18:56,045 --> 01:18:57,614
So, now what, Danny?

1111
01:18:58,514 --> 01:19:00,149
You taking me in?

1112
01:19:00,181 --> 01:19:02,085
Those are my orders.

1113
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:04,653
Your orders?

1114
01:19:04,687 --> 01:19:06,221
You, too?

1115
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:08,558
There's stashes like
this all over the country.

1116
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:11,059
There's always someone like me.

1117
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:14,229
Nearby, keep an eye on things.

1118
01:19:14,263 --> 01:19:16,666
And you'd have stopped him?

1119
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:20,669
-Your own brother?
-If I had to.

1120
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:23,005
That's cold.

1121
01:19:25,306 --> 01:19:28,211
-That's a lot of money, Danny.
-Yeah, and then what?

1122
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:32,214
Like I said, there's
always someone else.

1123
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:34,250
Someone like me.

1124
01:19:35,251 --> 01:19:37,220
You shouldn't have killed Paul.

1125
01:19:37,252 --> 01:19:39,788
It's a bad world all around.

1126
01:21:23,893 --> 01:21:28,797
<i>The eye is the
lamp of your body.</i>

1127
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:34,603
<i>So, if the eye is
healthy, your whole body</i>

1128
01:21:34,636 --> 01:21:36,839
<i>will be full of light.</i>

1129
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:38,673
<i>But if the eye is bad,</i>

1130
01:21:38,706 --> 01:21:42,778
<i>your whole body
will be full of darkness.</i>

1131
01:21:45,313 --> 01:21:48,476
<i>If then, the light
in you is darkness,</i>

1132
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:53,623
<i>how great then,
is the darkness?</i>
