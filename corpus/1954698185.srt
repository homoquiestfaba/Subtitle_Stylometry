00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:09,341
(church bell tolling)

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,900
Miracle of the Heart

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:29,394
%%

5
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:37,128
(siren)

6
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,190
When the call came
in I was thinking

7
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,190
Multiples from the accident.

8
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,400
No, there's just one.

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,730
My wife met a drop-dead
gorgeous girl at the office.

10
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,430
Why are you always
trying to fix me up?

11
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,330
I'm your friend.

12
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,540
I'm looking out for you.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,740
You work too hard.

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,610
Well, you can't
have a relationship

15
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,710
And this job at the same time.

16
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,780
Works for me.

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,580
Well, let's go,
William, duty calls.

18
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,550
All right, let's
get him into x-Ray.

19
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,450
Let's go, let's go.

20
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,380
This kid got a name?

21
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,450
Sean Addison, 19 years old.

22
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,990
Two-car collision
on the interstate.

23
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,650
X-rays?

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,420
Both legs are broken.

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,620
His pelvis is fractured.

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,890
But he's awake and responding --

27
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,560
His ultrasound is positive,
his abdomen's pretty tight,

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,560
He's a tough kid.

29
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm worried about that
internal bleeding.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,430
Hey, how you doing?

31
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,400
That's a dumb question.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,840
Doc, it's real
important to my mom

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,380
That I get home
in time for Christmas.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,980
Let's do this: Let's get
you home for Christmas.

35
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,650
Anesthesiologist:
Okay, Sean,

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,720
I want you to start counting
back from ten for me.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,990
Ten, nine, eight...

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,860
Get him protamine.

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Damn it!

40
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,030
I need to get a clamp
on the iliac to grab it.

41
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,930
It's okay, it's okay.

42
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,860
It's not okay.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,860
Come on, Sean,
c'mon, hang in there.

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,200
More surgicel and gelfoam.

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,130
We need a sponge.

46
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,670
We're losing volume,
we need pressure.

47
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,600
Get two units of blood.

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,430
The bleeding's out of control!

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,340
We are losing pressure.

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,700
Come on, Sean, come
on, hang in there.

51
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,440
We're losing him,
we're losing pressure!

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,310
Sponge.

53
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,110
Nurse:
Doctor?

54
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,280
Doctor!

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,750
Come on, Sean, come on.

56
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,120
Damn it!

57
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,150
Nathan?

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,520
Nathan?

59
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,550
Nathan!

60
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,420
(water running)

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,430
You did everything
you could, we all did.

62
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,300
I can't do this anymore.

63
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,940
It's not your fault.

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,880
I blew it.

65
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,980
Look, every surgeon
has gone through

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,180
What you're going through.

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,180
I lost him.

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,480
Things go wrong,
things beyond our control.

69
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,620
You don't understand,

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,250
I promised this kid I'd have
him home for Christmas.

71
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,190
I understand there's
a family sitting out there

72
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,890
We have to help through this.

73
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,860
I lost him.

74
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,840
Give me your wallet.

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,570
Whoa!

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,510
Hey, dad.

77
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,680
What are you doing here?

78
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,350
I'm just taking a few weeks
off from the hospital.

79
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,350
You're on vacation?

80
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,290
Well, I'm a little burnt out,
but yeah, sure, I'm on vacation.

81
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,820
Wilsonville's not my
idea of a vacation,

82
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,560
But, you know,
whatever turns your crank.

83
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,190
What, can't a guy take some time
off and bond with the old man?

84
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,930
Bond?

85
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,100
Are you feeling all right?

86
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,170
Shoes...They would be...

87
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,040
Ah.

88
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,850
(sighs)

89
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,950
Man on CD:
<i>Como esta usted.</i>

90
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,890
Como esta usted.

91
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,220
Como esta usted?

92
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,660
Como esta usted?

93
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,660
<i>Yo estoy bien.</i>

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,730
Yo estoy bien.

95
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,300
Yo estoy bien.

96
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Yo estoy bien.

97
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,770
<i>Mui bien.</i>

98
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,530
Aww...

99
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,410
(Spanish continues indistinct)

100
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,010
(laughs)

101
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,060
Ah, disculpe.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,690
Trabajas tu aqui?

103
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,360
Eschuche me.

104
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,500
Eschucha me?

105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,730
Trabajas tu aqui?

106
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,030
I'm sorry, I don't
speak...I wish I did.

107
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,170
I really wish I did.

108
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,500
I got it, I got it,
I got it dad.

109
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,880
I got it, I got it.

110
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,180
Can I...

111
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
Ah, si, si, si.

112
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,380
These books are a mess.

113
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,980
Let me see the Bill, Jack.

114
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,620
You're family, I'm not
going to charge you.

115
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,490
I just want to see it.

116
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,820
It's in here somewhere --
I'll stick it in the mail.

117
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,960
I know this lady
at church, Lydia.

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,130
Smart as a whip!

119
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,170
She's got half
the businesses in town online.

120
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,530
Nice lady.

121
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,440
Lost her husband about six years
ago, sings in the church choir.

122
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,440
I'll call her.

123
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,880
Okay, okay.

124
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,120
(Spanish on CD player)

125
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,620
Como se llamo usted?

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,090
Me llamo Meghan.

127
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,130
Hey, ma'am, you just picked up
a nail, but you're good to go.

128
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,160
Yo pienso tengo un poco dinero?

129
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,060
No, no, no money.

130
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,330
No dinero.

131
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,340
Just come back as a future
customer, that's good enough.

132
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,300
Bueno.

133
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,310
(car starts)

134
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,180
You're cute, Mr. Mechanic.

135
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,920
Muchas gracias!

136
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,430
Well, I'll be.

137
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,260
Hi, grandma.

138
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,630
Don't call me that.

139
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,330
What are you doing here?

140
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm just taking
a little time off.

141
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,340
Well, don't take
too much time off.

142
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,210
When I need my coronary
bypass I want you to operate.

143
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,340
The older you get, the more
you remind me of your mother.

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,410
We just lost one of our

145
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,620
After-school
playground volunteers

146
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Over at
the elementary school.

147
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,250
Oh, sorry, I'm just
here on vacation.

148
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,820
So, when you're on vacation,

149
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,190
That means you can't
help little kids?

150
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,430
I'll call the school
and tell them to expect you.

151
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,560
And don't be late.

152
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,300
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,900
Dad, have you seen
mom's Christmas shoes?

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,970
What?

155
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,470
Her red shoes, I've looked
everywhere for them.

156
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,570
They're on the top
shelf in the closet.

157
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,440
I checked there.

158
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,480
Son, I don't know.

159
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,580
Well, think!

160
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,810
Aw, jeez.

161
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,610
What?

162
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:32,290
They might have got mixed in
with some stuff I donated.

163
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,720
Going to the church.

164
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,300
Damn it!

165
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,410
Man: I already signed you
up, so you're all set.

166
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,140
Are we still going to move
to Alaska and go fishing?

167
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,510
As soon as I save up the money.

168
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,340
(bell rings)

169
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,950
Dad, will you walk
me to my class?

170
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,480
I got work to do.

171
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,420
Please?

172
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,390
Hey, don't screw around
after school, okay?

173
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,590
We're lucky to get
a couple of jobs

174
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,760
After only being
here for a week.

175
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,430
I need your help today.

176
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,660
Two blocks down this street --
big gray house on the corner.

177
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,700
Okay.

178
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,630
Feeling all right?

179
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,730
Yeah.

180
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,920
Now that I have
everyone's attention,

181
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,420
We're going to play a game.

182
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,260
The game is called spotlight,

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,860
And today in
the spotlight we have...

184
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,260
Hola mejor Jose,

185
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,270
O, Clara, no.

186
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,510
Va hacer Charlie Bennett.

187
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,770
Stand up, Charlie.

188
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,340
Charlie is new to
the school and the community,

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,910
So, tell us a little bit
about yourself, Charlie.

190
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,550
Where did you live before
you came to Wilsonville?

191
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,290
Well, my dad and I moved
here from Rockville,

192
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,120
And before that we were
in Silver Spring, Maryland,

193
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,260
Before that, Indiana.

194
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,660
My dad works on big estates
so that's why we move a lot.

195
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,800
Hey dork, there's no
estates in Wilsonville.

196
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
Okay, buddy, that's enough.

197
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,270
Very good, Charlie.

198
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,240
Sasha, could you flip
the lights for me?

199
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,040
Now, who can tell me
what cinco de mayo means?

200
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,710
Cinco de may-o is
Mexican mayonnaise.

201
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,380
(class laughs)

202
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,710
Okay, uh, Charlie.

203
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,520
Mexico's independence.

204
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,350
Exactly right, Charlie.

205
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,550
It's actually one of
the biggest holidays in Mexico,

206
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,390
And speaking of the holidays,

207
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,160
We all know that the holidays
are about family and friends,

208
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,200
So, I want you all
to start thinking about

209
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,570
Writing a paper on
someone who's important to you,

210
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,900
Someone special.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,740
Maybe even a family member,

212
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
And don't forget it's
due on December 15.

213
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,070
(bell rings)

214
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,510
Okay, gracias, everybody.

215
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,110
Class:
Gracias.

216
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,950
Marty James got the chicken
pox, so we're one man down.

217
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,810
So what do we want to do?

218
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,280
I can take both of these guys.

219
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,880
No, you have to play
two on two.

220
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,890
How can...

221
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,420
Hey, what's your name?

222
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,190
Charlie.

223
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,220
Charlie, do you want to play?

224
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,290
We're a man down.

225
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,130
Sure.

226
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,230
All right, it's you
two against you two.

227
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,530
Buddy, you're first.

228
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,830
All right, here we go,
two on two.

229
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,040
(whistle blows)

230
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,700
Whoa, steal!

231
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,370
Nicely done.

232
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,570
(boys chattering)

233
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,910
Oh, well done!

234
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,840
Very good.

235
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,180
All right, let's see
you do that again.

236
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,380
It's not gonna happen again.

237
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,160
Oh, between the legs he goes!

238
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,130
Very nice!

239
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,630
We got a player here.

240
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,860
Very good!

241
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,060
You should play
with us more often,

242
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,570
You could really whip
these guys into shape.

243
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,700
I gotta go.

244
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,470
Well, think about it,
Charlie, you're really good.

245
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,770
Emily, look at you!

246
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
You are getting so big.

247
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,940
If you ever need
me to baby-sit...

248
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,180
I'd love that, but Emily
hasn't been feeling well.

249
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,920
Oh, sweetheart.

250
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,650
Well, you just
let me know, okay?

251
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,380
Bye, hon.

252
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,850
Bye.

253
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,030
Are you...

254
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,870
Hey, are you all right?

255
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,400
Did you hurt your --

256
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,470
Oh, hey you --

257
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,880
Slowly:
Hola, me llamo Nathan.

258
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,710
Let's cut the Spanish, okay?

259
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,080
I'm in pain now.

260
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,980
I was just practicing
on you this morning.

261
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,020
It's my first semester here,

262
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,520
I was teaching
a section on Mexico.

263
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,150
Mui bien.

264
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,790
(laughing)

265
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,990
So you were at the garage this
morning, and now you're here.

266
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,590
What's going on?

267
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm stalking you.

268
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,930
No, no, I'm a volunteer here.

269
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,840
I was just playing basketball
with the kids earlier.

270
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,540
Your ankle feels okay.

271
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,570
That's because you're
holding the wrong one.

272
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,880
Right.

273
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,340
Meghan:
I can't believe I tripped.

274
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,910
This one.

275
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,010
Looks like it's
just like a sprain.

276
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,820
You might want to ice
it ten, 15 minutes,

277
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,120
Three or four times a day.

278
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,750
Instead of ice you can use
frozen peas or corn works well.

279
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,790
An ace bandage, too --

280
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,720
Wrap it up and keep it
elevated if you can.

281
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,160
Where did you learn all that?

282
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,130
Uh, I took a couple first aid
classes this Summer.

283
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,300
You know, lifeguard and stuff.

284
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,670
So you fix tires in the morning,

285
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,430
A playground monitor
in the afternoon

286
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,540
With a little sidewalk
first aid thrown into the mix.

287
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,240
Am I overlooking anything?

288
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,640
No, that's pretty much me.

289
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,510
Well, okay.

290
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,750
Send me a Bill for the flat tire
and the ankle, all right?

291
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,720
Hey, no charge.

292
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,050
Thanks.

293
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,720
What's with the shirt?

294
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,520
Uh, see that little
house over there?

295
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,530
Some of the other teachers
and moms and I

296
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,360
Decided to start a fundraiser
so that we could buy it

297
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,200
And turn it into
a daycare center.

298
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,930
We're doing a benefit
Christmas Eve.

299
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,430
Nice.

300
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,800
I gotta get going,
I'm late for training.

301
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,640
Nathan:
Training?

302
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,440
What training?

303
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,170
Cross country.

304
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,510
I'm a runner, six Miles a day.

305
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,910
Once a jock, always a jock.

306
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,910
Well, you shouldn't train
today, not with that ankle.

307
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,480
Are you kidding?

308
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,350
Haven't you ever heard
the expression, "no pain --

309
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,420
-- No gain," I know.

310
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,580
But still --

311
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,350
It's kind of a metaphor
for life, don't you think?

312
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,950
Well, okay, if you're not going
to take my ankle advice

313
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,190
Then you're going to have
to pay for the tire.

314
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:58,600
Okay, what do I owe you?

315
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,900
Call me at the garage,
maybe we can have dinner.

316
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,140
(children playing)

317
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,760
Hey Charlie, it's Nathan.

318
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,130
You need some help?

319
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,400
Yeah, sure.

320
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,970
Too bad you had to
leave the game so early.

321
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,410
Yeah, well, my dad needed me.

322
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,180
We're a team.

323
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,620
Nice place.

324
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,890
My dad and I don't live
here, we just work here.

325
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,890
When I was a kid we used
to take all the leaves,

326
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,660
Put them in a gigantic pile,

327
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,860
I'd hide inside
and our dog would go run,

328
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,860
Jump in the middle
and try to find me.

329
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,200
I never had a dog.

330
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,830
Does your mom work, too?

331
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,800
I don't have a mom.

332
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,540
I don't have a mom, either.

333
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,180
She died when
I was about your age.

334
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,520
I remember some things
about my mom, but not a lot.

335
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,960
She left when I was little,
to be an actress in Hollywood.

336
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,830
An actress, wow.

337
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,400
At least, that's
what my dad said.

338
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,800
I hate not having a mom.

339
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,210
Nathan:
Ah!

340
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,650
Look at this.

341
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,290
Aww!

342
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,360
Charlie.

343
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,860
Oh, hey, dad.

344
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,100
We were just... playing.

345
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,830
Sorry, it's my fault.

346
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,540
Who the hell are you?

347
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,210
I'm Nathan Andrews.

348
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm volunteering
at the school,

349
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
Just playing hoops
with the kids.

350
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,640
My first week.

351
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,310
This isn't a playground,
it's what we do for a living.

352
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,180
I --

353
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,250
See you at school, Charlie.

354
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,390
(car starts)

355
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,770
What the hell were you
doing playing basketball?

356
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,110
Charlie:
It's fun, dad.

357
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,810
Why can't I once in a while?

358
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,810
I mean, I'll be
careful, I promise.

359
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,350
The coach said I was a natural.

360
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,480
Coach?

361
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,280
He's not a coach.

362
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,120
What does he know?

363
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,220
He knows I'm good.

364
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,960
That right?

365
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,670
Wow, thanks, dad!

366
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,970
Perfect.

367
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,380
The shoes are gone.

368
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,020
I'm sorry, son.

369
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,720
I know it was a long time ago,
but I can't help it, you know?

370
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,870
I was attached to them.

371
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,220
I know.

372
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,860
Dad.

373
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,820
I don't think I'm going
to be a doctor anymore.

374
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,010
What?

375
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,290
Nathan:
It's not for me.

376
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,410
I mean, there are other
things to do in life.

377
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,550
What, like be a mechanic?

378
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,540
What's wrong with
being a mechanic?

379
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,630
You're a mechanic.

380
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,990
Yeah, but if I was smart
enough to be a doctor,

381
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,100
I'd be a doctor, Nathan.

382
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,270
I don't know, I just --

383
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,660
Oh, wait a minute,
what are you saying?

384
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,340
You think you're gonna
move back in here with me?

385
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,380
Is that it?

386
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,110
Why not?

387
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,270
Son, I'm planning
on selling the house.

388
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,090
What are you talking about?

389
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm getting restless
here, I need a change.

390
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,160
Dad, you can't -- no!

391
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,150
You can't do that.

392
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,030
What do you mean, no?

393
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,900
I mean, it's okay for you to
make a change in your life

394
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,300
But not me, is that
what you're saying?

395
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,530
Dad, I grew up in this house.

396
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,340
(country western music playing)

397
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,140
(laughing)

398
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,220
Okay, where are we?

399
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,980
I take all the girls I'm trying
to seduce to this very place.

400
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,790
Really?

401
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,550
Yeah.

402
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,270
Brave of you.

403
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,770
It sounds like a good choice.

404
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,310
Well, if you can't
bring the girl to Texas,

405
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,770
Bring Texas to the girl.

406
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,900
Wow.

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,030
Right?

408
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,270
I had no idea
this place was here.

409
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,530
Oh, yeah, I'm full of surprises.

410
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,650
Cheers.

411
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,780
(glasses clink)

412
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,730
So how'd a Texas girl
end up in new England?

413
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,650
Oh...Cowboys.

414
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,160
Let's just say
I took a bad fall.

415
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,030
Tex loved NASCAR, rodeo,
and Pat Conroy --

416
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,700
Deadly combination in my book.

417
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,530
I thought he was
the only guy for me,

418
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:49,460
And he fooled me into thinking
I was the only girl for him.

419
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,100
So, when I picked myself up,

420
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,540
I thought it would be a good
time to go someplace else.

421
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,770
What about you?

422
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,450
Yeah, there was one.

423
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,490
Rachel.

424
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,710
We fought like cats and dogs but
we were crazy about each other,

425
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,540
Talked about marriage
the whole year.

426
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,440
We actually planned
on running away together.

427
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,920
The day came, we gathered
up all our clothes

428
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,180
And what little money
we had in a dirty sock,

429
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,770
And then our moms caught us
and we got grounded.

430
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,610
What was this, fifth grade?

431
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,600
Fourth grade, yeah.

432
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,590
Oh, okay.

433
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,000
So nothing serious since Rachel?

434
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,860
My mom always said you don't
look for the right person,

435
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,280
You...Discover each other.

436
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,080
%% on Friday night when
I see her out %%

437
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,680
%% even in a crowd %%

438
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,160
%% she's hard to miss %%

439
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,530
%% there ain't
a man breathing air %%

440
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,510
%% who wouldn't stop and stare %%

441
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,720
%% and the best part is %%

442
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,600
%% she doesn't know
she's got it %%

443
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,590
%% she doesn't know
how bad we want it %%

444
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,010
%% she doesn't know
she's got it %%

445
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,360
%% and that's
what's getting me %%

446
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,570
You must be proud of yourself,
building up a business.

447
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,690
What?

448
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,560
What'd you say, Lydia?

449
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,300
I said, you must be
proud of yourself,

450
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,790
Building up a business.

451
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,170
Oh, yeah, it's
only a garage, so...

452
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,140
It's yours.

453
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,980
Reflects your hard work.

454
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,140
A lot of men couldn't have
accomplished what you have.

455
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,020
Well, I'm not the most organized
guy in the world, so good luck.

456
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,870
That's okay, at least you have
a computer, that's a start.

457
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,270
Yeah, that was from my son.

458
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,040
It was a few years ago.

459
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,740
He says I need to upgrade?

460
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,060
Oh, I think I'll start
with what you have

461
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,690
And we'll go from there.

462
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,250
Good, you do that.

463
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,120
Answering machine: <i>Nathan,</i>
<i>John Wilson at the bank.</i>

464
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,430
<i>We are processing</i>
<i>the home loan application,</i>

465
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,160
<i>Shouldn't be a problem, but</i>
<i>call if you have any questions.</i>

466
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,380
(beep)

467
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,800
<i>Nathan, this is Dr. Goetz.</i>

468
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,980
<i>William and the rest of</i>
<i>the team said to tell you</i>

469
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,260
<i>We sure could use some good</i>
<i>help around here --</i>

470
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,200
(voice cuts off)

471
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,920
So you think I'm nuts to want
to buy the house I grew up in?

472
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,890
Mmm, I moved around
so much as a kid,

473
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,640
There's not one of the houses
I'd ever want to go back to.

474
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,290
My mom died in that house.

475
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,700
So...Your plan is to live in
the house that you grew up in

476
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,020
The rest of your life,
and die in it like your mom did?

477
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,510
The house has memories.

478
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,980
Mmm, houses don't have memories.

479
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,960
People have memories.

480
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,100
Come on.

481
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,450
So, right now, it's
just an empty house,

482
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,920
But after we buy this place,

483
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,010
I'm going to bring in
all kinds of furniture:

484
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,580
A fridge, a microwave,
a new stove.

485
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,400
Upstairs, we're going
to have all kinds of,

486
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,160
You know, beds and cribs
for the children to nap in,

487
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,280
And then in the backyard

488
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,190
We're going to have
a swing set with slides --

489
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,060
Everything you need to open
up a daycare center,

490
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,250
And I love that it's across
the street from the school.

491
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,360
Whenever a single mom has a job,

492
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,730
She'll know that there's a safe
place she can leave her kids.

493
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,030
If anyone can do it.

494
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,020
You know what else?

495
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,410
I'd like to get every
doctor in town

496
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,960
To donate just an hour
or so every month.

497
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,910
Most of the women that would
come to a place like this

498
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,540
Would be just like my mom:
No health insurance,

499
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,790
Working two and three
jobs, no husband,

500
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,510
Always worried about leaving
their kids somewhere.

501
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,780
Can I be the first
person to volunteer?

502
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,810
I'm an expert plumber.

503
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,710
You're hired.

504
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,360
I can also probably get
a couple doctors to volunteer.

505
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,150
Another round?

506
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,800
Why not?

507
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,120
Here you go.

508
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,780
Old friend?

509
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,010
Yeah.

510
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,020
Wife.

511
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,200
Ex-wife.

512
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,690
Dad.

513
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,770
All right.

514
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,730
I was just leaving.

515
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,070
You came here just in time.

516
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
Wow, Christmas lights.

517
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,140
I love Christmas.

518
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,990
Your mother left
us on Christmas,

519
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,360
That always left
a bad taste in my mouth.

520
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,990
Last year you said
she left us on Easter,

521
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,380
Right before the resurrection.

522
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,850
Well, it was a holiday,
I remember that.

523
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,490
You know, she's probably
dancing on Broadway

524
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,650
Right this very minute.

525
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,010
Oh, come on, dad.

526
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,570
You're always making stuff up.

527
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,000
Like what?

528
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,560
One time you said
she was an artist

529
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,770
And she ran away
to Italy to paint.

530
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,870
Another time you said
she was in a country band,

531
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,620
And then another time you said
she was an actress in Hollywood.

532
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,040
Well, she's been
gone a long time.

533
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,790
She's done all that stuff.

534
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,260
What, you think I'm
making all this stuff up?

535
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,240
Okay, all right,
Mr. Smart guy.

536
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,150
She was a dancer.

537
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,140
These belonged to your mother.

538
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,840
Wow, man.

539
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,370
Nathan?

540
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,530
Hey.

541
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,610
What's up?

542
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,670
Rita's having trouble
getting her car to start.

543
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,860
Could you look at it?

544
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,680
Sure.

545
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,560
Whatever it costs,
I'll cover it.

546
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,650
Okay.

547
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,320
Thank you so much,
I really appreciate this.

548
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,430
No problem.

549
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,600
So, what do you think
the problem is?

550
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,850
Just a loose spark
plug wire, she's lucky.

551
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,120
Could you take
a look at the baby?

552
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,590
Rita doesn't have
health insurance.

553
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,460
Nathan, anything you can do.

554
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,100
Meghan, I'm a mechanic.

555
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,150
Do you know how much
trouble I could get in

556
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,340
Trying to diagnose a baby?

557
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,920
I've taken a few
first aid classes.

558
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,150
Nathan, please?

559
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:27,900
Meghan, I --

560
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,640
Please?

561
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,430
Come on.

562
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,810
All right.

563
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,790
(baby cries)

564
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,450
Thank you.

565
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,080
Hi, do you mind if --

566
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,060
She won't stop crying.

567
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,110
I can see.

568
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,660
Hi, hey little one.

569
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,870
Aww, you're okay.

570
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,690
Hi, hi, I know.

571
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
Is she going to be okay?

572
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,170
Yeah, okay, oh...

573
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,150
Yeah, I think she's
a little colicky.

574
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
Maybe it's her diet.

575
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,770
Milk allergy?

576
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,140
Let me give you the number
of a doctor friend of mine.

577
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,310
His name's William, and
he'll take care of your baby.

578
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,580
Thank you so much.

579
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,530
You're welcome.

580
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,550
Nathan, would you
give me a lift home?

581
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,090
Sure.

582
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,250
Oh, I know.

583
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,500
Baby, don't cry.

584
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,460
Bye, sweetheart.

585
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,810
I love you.

586
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,640
Oh, thank you.

587
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,880
Rita was my mom
and I was that little girl.

588
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,350
Thanks.

589
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,430
What?

590
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,480
Who are you?

591
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,240
What does that mean?

592
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,620
You're one of
the good guys, aren't you?

593
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,580
Meghan, you can't
do that anymore.

594
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,350
I can't give out medical advice.

595
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,500
But you're good at it.

596
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm good at lots of things.

597
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,730
Really?

598
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,560
Prove it.

599
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,230
Where is this guy?

600
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,400
Meghan: He'll be here,
he's a good guy.

601
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,410
Man: I need the environmental
impact report.

602
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,510
I need it not the day after
tomorrow, not tomorrow,

603
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,090
I need it today, now.

604
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,000
There he is.

605
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,130
I know, Mr. Layton,
but I'm having --

606
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,340
Look, this is an honest,
small-time businessman,

607
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,420
And this environmental lobby's

608
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,780
Trying to shut him down
any way that they can.

609
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,920
And he doesn't have 20 lawyers

610
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,890
Like all the bad guys do,
he's got us.

611
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,680
We're it.

612
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,870
I know, Mr. Layton.

613
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,200
I'm just having a problem
getting the reports from --

614
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,600
You know, you need to
get beyond the problem,

615
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,480
That's why you're here.

616
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,220
That's why you
became an attorney.

617
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,680
And if you have
a problem with that,

618
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,310
Then maybe you ought to
find a different career.

619
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,880
You think that guy's going
to donate to your cause?

620
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,730
Forget it.

621
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,200
Nathan, please.

622
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,000
I need all the help I can get.

623
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,420
If I don't get a down payment
by the end of the month

624
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,750
Then I lose the option
on the house

625
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,170
And there goes
the daycare center.

626
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,170
Excuse me.

627
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,050
Meghan.

628
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,830
Hi, Robert.

629
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,780
Hey.

630
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,410
Hi, Nathan Andrews.

631
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,630
Robert.

632
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,300
She's going to be
a good attorney one day,

633
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,530
She just doesn't know it yet.

634
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,890
This is a list of people
I've contacted

635
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,720
Who are willing to contribute.

636
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,520
Oh, Robert.

637
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,850
Thank you.

638
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,860
It's a great idea,
we need to find more ways

639
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,210
To contribute back
to the community.

640
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,030
Well, you wouldn't by
any Chance know someone

641
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,910
Who would want to help
administer this program?

642
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,160
There's legal
and administrative issues.

643
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,660
Well, I'd love to help,

644
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,390
But I think you should
talk to Julian Haymer

645
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,990
At legal aid society.

646
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,760
I've talked to him;
he's willing to help out.

647
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,750
Great!

648
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,250
Again, thank you.

649
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,330
You bet.

650
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,800
It's nice meeting you.

651
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,340
You, too.

652
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,880
Well, you're a great
judge of human nature.

653
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,000
Hey, would you come
out here a minute?

654
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,630
I need your advice.

655
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,570
You know, Lydia,

656
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,800
I was thinking about your idea.

657
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,870
Yeah, well like you
said, it's been 18 years.

658
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,150
Time for re-roofing
and repainting, right?

659
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,280
Yeah.

660
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,630
Nathan:
Dad.

661
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,760
There's got to be a better way.

662
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,010
What are you talking about?

663
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,790
You're using
20th century equipment

664
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,330
On 21st century technology;
it's inefficient.

665
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,550
You're the one that
went through college,

666
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,030
I mean, you're telling me
you can't figure this out?

667
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,990
You want me to do it?

668
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,150
No, I can do it,
it's just going to take

669
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,920
Two or three times
longer than it should.

670
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,440
You really need to invest
in some new equipment.

671
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,940
It would pay off for you,
for both of us.

672
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,410
I think Nathan's right, Jack.

673
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,440
It will increase
the value of the business.

674
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,130
(sighs)

675
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,580
And so, I can afford this?

676
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,930
Sure.

677
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,620
Then, we'll see.

678
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,620
Your son is very handsome.

679
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,890
Jack:
Takes after his mom.

680
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,690
I think he's got
a lot of you in him,

681
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,400
Especially through the eyes.

682
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,900
So, Nathan must have been pretty
young when he lost his mother.

683
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,680
He was about ten,
it's tough on him.

684
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,360
Tough on both of you.

685
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,450
And, of course,
after a few years,

686
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,970
People think you
ought to be over it,

687
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,310
Get on with your life, right?

688
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,870
What do they know?

689
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,150
I could be in line
at the post office

690
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,000
Or at the grocery store
or in church,

691
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,220
And I'd just start
bawling like a baby.

692
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,040
Felt pretty stupid sometimes.

693
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,720
Well, you couldn't help it.

694
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,980
Unless you've been through it.

695
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,100
That's right, you got
no idea what it's like.

696
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,420
Yeah, and you never get over
losing someone like that, never.

697
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,240
It feels like yesterday.

698
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,250
I know exactly what you mean.

699
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,090
Do you date at all, Jack?

700
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,860
No.

701
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:51,370
Well, I mean, I have off
and on over the years,

702
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,470
But I haven't given it
much thought lately.

703
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,800
I have.

704
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,950
Well, just a little.

705
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,410
Hey, what are you doing?

706
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,910
Toss those bags in the truck.

707
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,760
Hey dad, how long have
you had the dancing shoes?

708
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,710
I don't know, a long time.

709
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,080
How come you've never
shown them to me before?

710
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,330
Well, maybe I lost them,
or maybe I couldn't find them.

711
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,730
Could have told me about them.

712
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,900
Tucker:
What would you have done?

713
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,160
You'd drive me
nuts, that's what.

714
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,640
Hey, if you don't want
them, I'll get rid of them.

715
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,470
No, no, I want them.

716
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,910
Did mom take dancing
lessons when she was little?

717
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,120
How'd she get so good?

718
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,820
You know what kind
of dancing she does?

719
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,480
Charlie, what do you think
I am, a damn encyclopedia?

720
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,790
Dad?

721
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,090
What?

722
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:28,100
You have any idea how
good she was at dancing?

723
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,890
Charlie, why don't you
just maybe sit down

724
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,830
And do some homework
or something, okay?

725
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,580
All right, let's beat
these bums, come on.

726
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,090
Nice, nice.

727
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,760
Charlie?

728
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,700
Charlie?

729
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,820
Charlie!

730
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,310
Charlie, talk to me!

731
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,140
Nathan, what is it?

732
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,620
What's wrong with him?

733
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,230
Oh, my God.

734
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,910
What happened?

735
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,000
Go get help, hurry.

736
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,090
Call 911.

737
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,650
We've got to get him
to new England general.

738
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,460
Guys, give him some room.

739
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,610
Back up, please?

740
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,550
Hang in there, buddy.

741
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,040
Stay with me.

742
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,490
Meghan: Why did we have to bring
him all the way to Burlington?

743
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,430
What's happened to him, Nathan?

744
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,110
What's going on?

745
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,040
Good to see you again.

746
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,770
His father's on his way.

747
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,190
His 02 levels are up.

748
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,220
Right, right.

749
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,970
His aorta's enlarged,
Marfan syndrome.

750
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,680
This boy had his chest
opened when he was three.

751
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,520
They sewed in a graft but
the repair was never perfect.

752
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,940
It's gotten considerably worse.

753
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,280
Excuse me, but, what's
wrong with Charlie?

754
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,090
How does a healthy
ten-year-old boy

755
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,880
Go from playing
basketball to the ICU?

756
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,210
Charlie's not healthy.

757
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,730
He's got a cardio condition that
could have major consequences.

758
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,660
Yeah, his heart, Meghan,
it's -- it's failing.

759
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,870
Well, can you fix it?

760
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,020
I mean, can you do something?

761
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,950
We've put him on some new
medication that may sustain him.

762
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,340
It's our only hope, he's
not a transplant candidate.

763
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,750
I hope this means
you're back, doctor.

764
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,660
Hey.

765
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,190
How's Charlie?

766
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,540
I just got back
from the hospital.

767
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,190
His medication is working, he
should be home in a few days.

768
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,010
Good.

769
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,930
How are you?

770
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,070
I must be coming
down with something.

771
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,380
Maybe disappointment.

772
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,450
Look, Meghan, I didn't
mean to deceive you.

773
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,580
Then what were you doing?

774
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,180
Because you sure
could have fooled me.

775
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,710
I just didn't want
everyone in town

776
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,310
Knowing that I'd
left the hospital.

777
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,680
What do you think
everyone's thinking

778
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,620
When they see you working
at the garage, Nathan?

779
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,610
Hello?

780
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,380
I don't know --

781
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,420
Don't be dishonest with me.

782
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,660
Look --

783
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,030
I had my fill of that in
Texas, I don't want it again.

784
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,970
I am not being
dishonest with you.

785
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,040
I'm not.

786
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,160
No, you just didn't tell
me what you've spent

787
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,260
The last 12 years
of your life doing.

788
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,460
Nathan, figure out what's
holding you back in life,

789
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,110
Let it go, and move on.

790
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,780
And don't lie to me!

791
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,070
Woman's voice:
"dear Nathan,

792
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,300
How excited you must be on
your high school graduation.

793
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,210
I wish I could have been there.

794
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,720
I bet you looked so handsome
in your cap and gown.

795
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,660
Right now, you're probably
trying to figure out

796
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,570
What to do in life.

797
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,170
I did, too.

798
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,960
I loved music.

799
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,930
I was so grateful when I was
chosen to lead the youth choir

800
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,050
In the annual Christmas show.

801
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,370
What a surprise!

802
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,970
What fun!

803
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,220
If I could say anything to you,

804
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,000
I would say to do
what you love to do.

805
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,030
To be happy in your
work is a blessing.

806
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,290
All my love, mom."

807
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:43,510
Hey dad, remember those letters
mom wrote to me before she died?

808
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:44,530
I forgot that she
was thinking about

809
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,010
Being a music major in college.

810
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,790
Man, she could do anything.

811
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,570
Hey, some of that new
equipment is coming in, huh?

812
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,210
Oh hey, and here she talks about
the first time she met you.

813
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,360
I don't want to talk about it.

814
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,510
Nathan: You guys had
your picture taken together

815
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,990
At some county fair?

816
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,720
Are you listening to me?

817
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,310
Am I getting through?

818
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,400
Dad --

819
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,600
Look, every damn holiday,
every damn vacation

820
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,860
You come home from school

821
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,890
And we drag out the pictures,
drag out the letters,

822
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,040
Talk about mom, cry about mom.

823
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,490
It makes me feel
good to talk about her.

824
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:18,280
Well maybe it makes you feel
good, but then you'd leave.

825
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,330
For the next month I'm walking
around with my guts hanging out.

826
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,750
I can't live like that
year after year, I can't.

827
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,960
So, what are we supposed to do,
pretend mom never existed?

828
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,130
Is that what you want?

829
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,830
No, I need to live
like she's gone.

830
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,150
Well, I don't.

831
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,680
(sighs)

832
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,350
Why are you really here?

833
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,470
What do you mean, why?

834
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,110
I told you, I don't want
to be a doctor anymore.

835
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,880
Baloney.

836
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,650
You ate, drank,
and slept that stuff

837
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,550
And now suddenly you
change your mind?

838
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,690
I just wanted to
come home for a bit.

839
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,880
Your senior year of high school,

840
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,500
You said you couldn't wait
to get out of this house,

841
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,410
This dumpy little town.

842
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,450
Yeah, well, maybe I've grown up.

843
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:03,090
Or maybe you haven't,
maybe that's your problem.

844
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,950
Hey, dad, are we going to have
Christmas lights at our place?

845
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,070
Probably not.

846
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,880
Why not?

847
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,210
I already told you,

848
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,640
I get a bad taste in my mouth
when it comes to Christmas.

849
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:25,280
Hey, dad --

850
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,500
Charlie, look.

851
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,010
In case you haven't noticed,
we're trying to work here.

852
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,230
Hey, dad, how tall was mom?

853
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,630
Don't you have some
homework to do?

854
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,420
How many school
days did you miss?

855
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,840
This is my homework.

856
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,640
I have to write
a report about mom.

857
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,610
Now, how tall is she exactly?

858
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,420
Five foot five.

859
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,380
Brown eyes, right?

860
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:07,360
When I first met your mom,

861
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:15,100
She was a waitress at
a truck stop outside Cincinnati.

862
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:27,280
Yeah, she had the most beautiful
brown eyes I'd ever seen.

863
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:34,060
She could make me laugh,
like nobody I'd ever met.

864
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:39,330
She had big dreams,
way bigger than mine.

865
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:44,980
I figured out pretty quick that
I couldn't live without her,

866
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:54,000
So we took off,
just the two of us, got married.

867
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:58,330
Well, what kind
of dancer is she?

868
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,900
I don't remember.

869
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,910
You don't remember?

870
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,140
Didn't you ever watch her?

871
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,590
I mean, what did it look
like when she danced?

872
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,310
Did she have a costume,
or did she dance alone,

873
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,580
Or with a bunch
of other dancers?

874
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,590
Do you know the name of
the kind of dancing she did?

875
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,890
Fred something or other,
I think.

876
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,060
That's all I remember.

877
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,900
Fred?

878
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:21,790
Who's Fred?

879
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,060
The dancer guy!

880
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,280
Why don't you ask your teachers?

881
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,160
Why I pay all
the damn taxes I do.

882
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,790
Fred...Something.

883
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:04,990
%% was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay %%

884
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:17,160
%% in fields where they lay
keeping their sheep... %%

885
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,220
(doorbell rings)

886
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,700
Charlie, what are you
doing out so late?

887
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,300
My dad said it was okay.

888
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,190
All right, come in.

889
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,510
Megan: It sure is good to
see you up and about,

890
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,480
Looking so good.

891
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,150
Miss Sullivan,
I kinda had a question.

892
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,300
Okay, let me just turn this off.

893
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,080
Running is hard.

894
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,220
To do anything well is hard.

895
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,500
Come on, let's sit.

896
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,870
So, did you come here
for some math help?

897
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,020
Um, I was working on
the report about my mom,

898
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,350
And she's a dancer.

899
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,810
Ooh, a dancer.

900
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,110
What kind of dancer?

901
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,150
That's what I came
here to ask you.

902
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,790
All my dad said
was Fred something.

903
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,390
Fred Astaire?

904
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,250
You know him, this Fred guy?

905
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,850
Well, I don't know him,

906
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,550
But I know the kind of dancing
that your mom does.

907
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,110
Could you show me?

908
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,010
Um...Well...

909
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,750
Charlie:
Please?

910
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,070
Okay, I'm not very good,

911
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,150
But I've seen a lot
of the old movies.

912
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,140
It's very elegant and romantic.

913
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:37,230
The men get all dressed up,
usually in their tuxedos,

914
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:41,250
And the women, they wear these
beautiful dresses and shoes

915
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,100
And they kind of glide
across the dance floor,

916
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:50,270
Staring into one another's eyes.

917
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,910
Hey, coach, what
are you doing here?

918
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,800
Oh, I was just going
to visit your teacher.

919
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,660
Meghan's a good friend of mine.

920
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,350
My teacher sure
can dance, coach.

921
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,480
She sure can.

922
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,970
Charlie, you need a ride home?

923
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,620
Okay.

924
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,550
Thanks.

925
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:32,210
So, Charlie, you've been
sick a long time, huh?

926
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,970
As long as I can remember.

927
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,250
Been to a lot of doctors?

928
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:41,070
Yeah, my dad's taken me to
about a thousand of them.

929
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,770
You remember to
take your medicine?

930
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,650
Yeah.

931
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:44,880
You sure?

932
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,580
Because I've been thinking
of a way you can remember.

933
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,790
We could tattoo it
on your forehead,

934
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,230
Or we can get some of the girls
at your school to remind you.

935
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,460
No, coach, I promise
I remember.

936
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,220
Okay?

937
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,650
Honest.

938
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,300
All right, because it's
really important that you do.

939
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:05,340
And sorry,
but no more basketball.

940
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,270
Coach, remember how I
said my mom was a dancer?

941
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,270
Yeah.

942
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,190
Look.

943
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,270
These are her dancing shoes.

944
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,230
Where...

945
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,210
Coach, are you okay?

946
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:53,980
Yeah, I just...My mom had
a pair of shoes just like this.

947
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,210
Thanks for the ride.

948
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,320
Later.

949
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,150
Stay after those pledges.

950
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,430
Can't stop now, we have too many
moms and kids depending on us.

951
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,240
Okay, Meghan.

952
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,940
We can do this.

953
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,740
We've got three weeks
'til the benefit.

954
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,170
All right, see ya.

955
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,740
Bye.

956
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:49,750
Hey.

957
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:50,540
Hey.

958
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,390
You got a minute?

959
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,340
Can we talk?

960
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,180
Sure.

961
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,140
I know this is going to sound
nuts, but when I was a kid,

962
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,450
I bought this pair of red shoes
for my mother, on Christmas Eve,

963
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,930
The night she died, and for
years I hadn't seen them,

964
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,420
And in fact I thought
they were lost,

965
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,290
But somehow Charlie
has found them.

966
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,970
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

967
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,940
No, not really.

968
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:19,860
Well, just a little bit.

969
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,650
So, Charlie has
a pair of red shoes

970
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,850
That once belonged
to your mother.

971
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,390
What's going on, Nathan?

972
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,660
Is this about losing
a pair of shoes?

973
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,840
The day I walked
out of the hospital,

974
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,900
I lost a teenage kid
on the operating table.

975
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:43,690
When I was looking down on him,

976
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,400
This wave swept over me
and I was ten years old again,

977
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:53,290
And afraid -- afraid of losing
someone else, you know?

978
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,960
Afraid of losing my dad.

979
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,210
So --

980
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,980
So, that's why you moved
back into the house.

981
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:01,940
Yeah, so we could be together.

982
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:07,690
I can't shake that
feeling of losing him.

983
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:12,830
You're not going to lose
your dad, Nathan, okay?

984
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,610
And you're stuck with me.

985
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,170
I just think sometimes I'm
too tough on him, you know?

986
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,080
I mean, a man wants to
do right by his kids,

987
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:37,040
But...Gosh, sometimes you just
don't know what right is.

988
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,410
Yeah, I'm thinking of
selling my business.

989
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,550
My son's not going to like it.

990
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,800
How old's your boy?

991
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,630
He's late twenties.

992
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,460
He's a good kid,
he's confused maybe,

993
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,370
A little like his old man.

994
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,170
(laughing)

995
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:56,310
I don't know, maybe it's
not such a good idea.

996
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:00,470
Tucker, kind of new around here.

997
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,590
Jack, been here too long.

998
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,950
Hey, you don't mind
an opinion, do you, Jack?

999
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,020
No, go ahead.

1000
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,870
Well, your kid, he's got
a whole life ahead of him,

1001
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:22,190
And you don't.

1002
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,220
Here's to fatherhood.

1003
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,610
You don't come
here much, do you?

1004
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:35,980
What makes you say that?

1005
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,120
Well, you're one of those guys
that stares into his beer

1006
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,420
Instead of drinking it.

1007
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:44,050
It's a dead giveaway, man.

1008
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,730
My wife died 18 years ago

1009
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:52,870
And in those days I came
in all the time.

1010
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,980
But -- I started thinking
about my boy at home

1011
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:05,150
And I realized I was spending
way too much time here.

1012
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:12,130
I've been lying to
my kid for years.

1013
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:20,550
His mother left us and then
she was killed in a car crash.

1014
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,870
I started making up stories
to make it easier on him,

1015
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,780
You know, and hell, when he was
little, it worked pretty good.

1016
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,890
But he's older now;
he's asking more questions,

1017
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:37,190
And I'm running out of
stories and answers.

1018
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,630
How about the truth?

1019
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,660
No, I could never tell him.

1020
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,270
I could never tell him.

1021
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,670
Thanks.

1022
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,180
Sure.

1023
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,750
Christmas.

1024
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:21,430
Man: I'll draw up the contract

1025
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,280
And get the papers over for you
to sign as soon as possible.

1026
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,510
Looking forward to
hearing from you.

1027
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,510
You bet.

1028
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,520
Dad, hey.

1029
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,840
Hey!

1030
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,200
Place looks great, huh?

1031
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,970
Yeah, listen, I need your help.

1032
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,400
I was a little tough
on you the other night.

1033
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:07,590
No, it's fine.

1034
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,240
The bank turned me down
for the loan on the house.

1035
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,970
Well, you owe about a million
bucks in medical school loans,

1036
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:16,920
And you're not a doctor
anymore, so it's no wonder.

1037
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:22,440
Right, but they'll accept
a loan if you'll co-sign.

1038
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:25,090
Well, I can't do that.

1039
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,580
What do you mean
you can't do that?

1040
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,650
I'm selling the garage.

1041
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,730
A guy just left here,
he's in real estate,

1042
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:35,710
And he says he can turn
the place over fast, so --

1043
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:37,860
Dad, you can't sell
this place, too.

1044
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,780
What is going on?

1045
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,830
Son, you've got your whole life
in front of you, and I don't.

1046
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,130
This is a great
opportunity for me.

1047
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,310
You think this is easy?

1048
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:51,550
Selling my house, my business?

1049
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,560
Letting go
a chunk of my life?

1050
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:00,090
I have to.

1051
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:09,010
Lydia:
Jack?

1052
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,450
Are you okay?

1053
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,210
Yeah, yeah.

1054
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:17,560
I just can't believe we
finished the place is all.

1055
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,600
Yeah.

1056
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,170
A lot of hard work, wasn't it?

1057
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:21,950
Mm-hmm.

1058
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,310
It was definitely worth it.

1059
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,710
Lydia:
I think so.

1060
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,600
So what are you going to do,
after you sell the place?

1061
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,150
You know, I worked
my whole life,

1062
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:35,190
And I've never really done
anything, been anywhere,

1063
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,960
And I was thinking --

1064
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:41,090
I was thinking I was
going to get an R.V.

1065
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,400
I'm going to get an R.V.,
I'm gonna travel around,

1066
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:49,460
Maybe go fishing, go to Florida.

1067
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,380
I really appreciate
what you've done for me.

1068
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:58,590
I never could have done
any of this without you.

1069
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:11,250
So, you know, if you want to
send me a Bill, that's fine.

1070
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:15,440
Yeah, sure.

1071
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:22,280
Hey, Lydia.

1072
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,890
Thanks.

1073
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:41,520
%% don't waste your time
looking over your shoulder %%

1074
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:47,300
%% those loves from the past
ain't getting no closer %%

1075
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,390
%% when I look in my future
you're all I can see %%

1076
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:59,220
%% so honey don't go
loving on nobody but me %%

1077
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:06,650
%% nobody but me gonna love you
like you ought to be loved on %%

1078
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,710
Meghan?

1079
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:14,100
Whoa, whoa!

1080
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:24,110
%% don't go loving on
nobody but me %%

1081
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,970
Excuse me.

1082
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,260
Nathan.

1083
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,160
Tell me.

1084
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,230
Tested positive for hep b.

1085
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:55,880
The liver biopsy showed
severe hepatic cirrhosis.

1086
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,440
Viral, with irreparable damage.

1087
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,170
Could have had it for
the last six months or so,

1088
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,550
The symptoms mimic a bad flu.

1089
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:08,550
We need to get a transplant
team involved, now.

1090
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:25,740
I can't lose her,
William, I just can't.

1091
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,510
Say, Mr. Mechanic.

1092
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,660
Is there any Chance I can
get a new transmission?

1093
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:22,390
My mama always said Christmas
was the time for miracles.

1094
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,310
Sometimes it's tough
waiting for the Miracle.

1095
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:34,550
I've got some bad news.

1096
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,700
I told the front desk

1097
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:38,980
You're not allowed to have
any visitors from Texas,

1098
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,110
Particularly those big,
strong cowboy types.

1099
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,110
I don't need the competition.

1100
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,110
(laughing)

1101
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,670
Tex and I didn't
want the same things.

1102
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,890
All I wanted was commitment.

1103
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:02,640
Maybe it's old-fashioned,
but it works for me.

1104
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:08,390
It's funny how things
work, isn't it?

1105
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:14,490
If none of that happened,
I wouldn't have left Texas,

1106
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,640
And I wouldn't have met you.

1107
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:22,560
I guess I owe Tex.

1108
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,980
I've been reading
my mother's letters.

1109
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:37,130
And?

1110
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:42,840
She said, one day,
I would meet a girl

1111
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:48,360
And my heart would skip a beat
when she smiled at me.

1112
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,090
And then the day would
come when I realized

1113
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:55,720
I couldn't live without her.

1114
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:59,050
And she was right.

1115
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:05,110
Hmm.

1116
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,870
Hey, Meghan's friend, right?

1117
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:16,660
Yeah.

1118
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,480
Yeah, Nathan.

1119
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,080
You remind me of somebody.

1120
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:22,000
Oh, yeah?

1121
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:25,300
Yeah, I just can't
figure out who.

1122
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,830
I've had that happen.

1123
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:27,720
How's she doing?

1124
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,860
She's not good.

1125
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,760
Can I go see her?

1126
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:35,690
Yeah, I'm sure she'd love that.

1127
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:39,610
How are you holding up?

1128
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:45,500
She's really sick, and there's
nothing I can do about that.

1129
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,910
And now this house
that she wants to buy,

1130
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,400
The option's up
on Christmas Eve,

1131
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,580
So that's not going to happen.

1132
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:57,550
You never know
what's going to be.

1133
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,300
See you.

1134
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:36,060
Hey, how's Meghan?

1135
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:40,680
What do you care?

1136
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:44,090
Hey!

1137
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,270
Nathan, come here.

1138
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,340
I want to show you something.

1139
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,680
Come on.

1140
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:04,590
What is it?

1141
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,830
Sometimes, when you
were at school,

1142
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:09,120
And I knew I was by myself,

1143
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:12,520
I'd get a little crazy
because I missed her so much,

1144
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:19,430
And...

1145
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:22,350
Nice, huh?

1146
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:28,380
I thought about
plastering it over,

1147
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,080
But over the years when
stupid things would annoy me,

1148
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,220
I would come in here,
I would look at the hole,

1149
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:36,690
And I would realize what
was important in life.

1150
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,420
Yeah, well, if I never came home

1151
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:42,650
I wouldn't be going through
any of this right now.

1152
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,790
I would go through
everything --

1153
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,660
The pain and the loss
all over again,

1154
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:53,270
To hold your mother
one more minute.

1155
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:11,590
(crying)

1156
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,590
Hey, Charlie boy.

1157
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,800
How'd you get in here?

1158
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,300
I kinda snuck in.

1159
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,150
Thank you.

1160
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,890
Well, sneaking in is
the best way to visit.

1161
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,760
How's school?

1162
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,840
I finished my paper.

1163
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,300
It's called "mom."

1164
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:50,990
You did?

1165
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:51,730
Can I read it?

1166
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:55,480
Yeah.

1167
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:04,400
There was a fire
in your trailer?

1168
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,510
Yeah, when I was a baby.

1169
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:08,660
Sweetheart, that's terrible.

1170
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,990
Everything got burned up,

1171
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,270
Including all
the pictures of my mom.

1172
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,780
You know, my mom used to say

1173
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:29,630
That you learn the most about
God when times are tough.

1174
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,380
My dad and I have had
a lot of tough times.

1175
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,770
We must be at the top
of God's list, huh?

1176
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,610
(laughing)

1177
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:43,210
Yeah, and you are right at the
top of my list, that's for sure.

1178
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,580
An a?

1179
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:53,870
Wow!

1180
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:58,260
Well, it's one of the best
papers I've ever read.

1181
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:07,590
What's wrong with you?

1182
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:11,580
I have a bad liver.

1183
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,160
I need a new one.

1184
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:18,410
Are you going to die?

1185
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,220
Maybe.

1186
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,990
I don't want you to die.

1187
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:28,930
Charlie, look at me.

1188
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,510
Here, come here.

1189
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,740
The best thing you can do
for me right now

1190
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:39,900
Is not to worry about me.

1191
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,800
Take care of yourself, okay?

1192
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:50,020
Okay.

1193
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:13,550
Okay, here we go!

1194
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,790
Charlie, Charlie.

1195
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,560
A little Christmas cheer, buddy.

1196
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,500
Dad?

1197
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:23,140
I don't feel so good.

1198
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,900
Daddy?

1199
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,490
Hi, coach.

1200
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:51,200
Hi, Mr. Three-point jump shot.

1201
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:55,080
I guess I'm not
doing so good, am I?

1202
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,810
The medication's
not working anymore.

1203
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:05,320
So your heart can't work
the way it's supposed to.

1204
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:08,830
What's Heaven like?

1205
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,470
I don't know.

1206
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,810
But I bet it's beautiful.

1207
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:24,800
Do you think you can see
everything from Heaven?

1208
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:27,760
You don't want to
see everything.

1209
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:32,830
Garbage can, inside of a toilet.

1210
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:39,710
But I bet I'll be able to see
buddy cheating at basketball,

1211
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,890
My dad cleaning gutters.

1212
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,200
I bet you will.

1213
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:55,000
Why is God taking me?

1214
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:02,150
Charlie, God isn't taking you,
he's receiving you.

1215
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,480
I don't know why
it has to be now,

1216
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:11,690
But I believe that
God must need you.

1217
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:15,570
He must want you to be with him.

1218
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:20,530
Maybe he needs a good outside
shooter for one of his teams.

1219
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:24,080
Maybe he does.

1220
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:32,830
What does your mom look like?

1221
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:45,520
Well, she's not very tall,
and she has brown hair,

1222
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:57,340
And blue eyes, these
dimples, and a great smile.

1223
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:01,670
And she's got a great laugh,

1224
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,580
So if you see someone up there
that looks like that,

1225
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:05,720
It just might be her.

1226
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:10,990
If I see her, would you like me
to tell her something for you?

1227
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:15,150
Yeah.

1228
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:20,730
Tell her that I still miss her,

1229
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:26,660
And that I love her as much now
as I did when she was here.

1230
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,900
Okay.

1231
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,330
Coach?

1232
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,650
Could you do something for me?

1233
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,980
Sure.

1234
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:49,020
I'd like my teacher
to have these.

1235
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,790
You got it.

1236
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,310
Charlie:
Hi, dad.

1237
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,180
Hi.

1238
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:57,290
I guess I'm not going
to make it to Alaska.

1239
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:02,330
Alaska's not all it's
cracked up to be.

1240
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:08,970
It's too damn cold
up there, anyway.

1241
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:19,900
I know it's not
Christmas yet, but...

1242
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:33,920
Here, let me help you.

1243
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,140
Charlie?

1244
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:48,020
It's your mom.

1245
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,830
I just saw her, dad.

1246
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,120
I just saw her.

1247
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:59,490
I think mom is where I'm going.

1248
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:05,180
She was dancing,
dad, she was dancing.

1249
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:11,530
Look, you just rest, okay?

1250
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,020
Because I've got this
little job to do,

1251
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:18,990
And I'll be back later.

1252
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:21,830
Dad?

1253
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,970
Could you stay?

1254
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:29,090
Just this one time?

1255
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:34,840
Yeah, sure, I can stay.

1256
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:48,730
My coach says you can see
everything from Heaven.

1257
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:54,720
When you go to Alaska,
could you pick salmon for me?

1258
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:58,160
Yeah, sure.

1259
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:03,230
My teacher's real sick.

1260
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:07,350
Yeah, I know.

1261
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,490
Dad, I want you to
promise me something.

1262
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,900
Anything, son.

1263
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:20,490
Anything you want.

1264
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,230
Hey.

1265
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:15,140
Hey.

1266
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,330
So I guess you got that
transmission after all.

1267
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,220
Why did it have to be Charlie?

1268
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:27,330
I don't know,
Meghan, I don't know.

1269
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:31,110
But the important
thing is, you're alive,

1270
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,670
And Charlie was
a big part of that.

1271
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:37,650
You helped him
through, didn't you?

1272
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,780
Of course.

1273
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:44,900
And he helped me through.

1274
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:57,130
Oh, he wanted you to have these.

1275
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:02,230
They belonged to his
mother, and my mother,

1276
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,790
And now they belong to you.

1277
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:21,610
I love you so much.

1278
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,520
Nathan, thanks for coming.

1279
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:28,480
Yeah, not a problem.

1280
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:31,340
Sit.

1281
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:46,560
Listen, a long time ago,
years, I was a jerk.

1282
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:51,460
All I cared about was my work, I
spent no time with my daughter,

1283
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,690
Marriage was on the rocks --

1284
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,780
Mr. Layton,
I'm not sure I should --

1285
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:58,550
And on Christmas Eve
I met a little boy

1286
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,860
At Wilson's department store

1287
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:05,930
Who was trying to buy
a pair of shoes for his mom.

1288
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:18,260
Thanks, mister.

1289
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:24,080
My God.

1290
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:28,810
That night changed my life.

1291
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,340
If it hadn't been for you,

1292
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:34,020
I never would have been able
to buy my mom that present.

1293
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,490
I guess we were both
meant to be there.

1294
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:49,410
Tell Meghan not to worry
about the kids' house.

1295
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:51,890
Who'd have thought
a pair of shoes

1296
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:55,340
Can change people's lives?

1297
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:01,570
Thank you.

1298
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:07,250
Nathan.

1299
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:09,460
You're doing great.

1300
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,920
Your mom would be proud.

1301
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:33,640
(phone dialing)

1302
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:36,430
(phone ringing)

1303
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,250
Lydia:
<i>Hello?</i>

1304
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:38,850
Hi, it's Jack.

1305
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,860
<i>Oh, hi Jack.</i>

1306
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:44,230
Listen, there's a fundraiser
tonight in the town square

1307
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,810
With some sort of surprise guest
or surprise something,

1308
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:50,900
And I was wondering,
if you're not busy,

1309
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,750
That maybe you
could meet me there.

1310
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:17,250
%% I remember
our first Christmas %%

1311
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:23,000
%% we were young and so in love %%

1312
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:29,620
%% nothing to give
but we had each other %%

1313
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:37,110
%% somehow it was
more than enough %%

1314
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:43,470
%% I remember how I held you %%

1315
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:49,460
%% and said I'd
never let you go %%

1316
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:56,920
%% now here we are another year
another Christmas %%

1317
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:02,740
%% and there's something
you should know %%

1318
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,260
%% this is my Christmas
present... %%

1319
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:06,990
You cold?

1320
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:12,950
A little.

1321
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:17,180
Thanks, Jack.

1322
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:21,100
Hey, you ever been to Florida?

1323
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,650
No, but I'd like to.

1324
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:34,100
Joe, thanks for making
the call to Nashville.

1325
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,800
I feel so thankful.

1326
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:37,840
Yeah, me too.

1327
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:42,950
Hey, I'm going to go back
into the hospital -- pediatrics.

1328
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,760
Nathan!

1329
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:48,870
And, there's something else.

1330
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:52,990
A little early
Christmas present.

1331
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,500
The house.

1332
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,800
Robert bought the kids' house.

1333
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,110
%% ... God will see us through %%

1334
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,800
%% and you'll have me %%

1335
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:09,880
%% and I'll have you %%

1336
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:12,370
%% and you'll have me %%

1337
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:17,680
%% and I'll have you %%

1338
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:29,090
(applause)

1339
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:32,930
Thank you.

1340
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,500
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1341
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,220
We have a surprise
guest tonight here,

1342
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,960
All the way from
Nashville, Tennessee.

1343
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:42,970
Would you make
welcome Blake Shelton.

1344
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:47,470
Merry Christmas,
Blake, we love you!

1345
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:51,220
Thank you, thank you.

1346
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:52,470
A new song, everybody.

1347
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,930
Let's hear it for them.

1348
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:58,170
I also want to send out a
special thanks to Robert Layton,

1349
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,310
Who put all this
together for us tonight.

1350
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,780
Thank you, Robert.

1351
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:05,660
You know, there's one person
who probably understands

1352
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:08,790
More why we're here tonight
more than anyone else.

1353
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:09,810
Meghan?

1354
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,720
Is Meghan out there?

1355
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:12,840
Meghan?

1356
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:15,190
She's right here.

1357
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,210
(applause)

1358
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:22,070
Thank you, thank you
so much for coming.

1359
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:27,750
Tonight is about raising
money for the kids' house.

1360
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:32,760
I would like to rename the
kids' house "Charlie's House,"

1361
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:36,810
In honor of a very
special little boy.

1362
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:42,420
Charlie wasn't in this town for
very long, but he touched lives.

1363
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,840
I know he touched mine.

1364
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:48,560
He gave me my life back.

1365
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:53,190
Charlie, I love you.

1366
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,470
Blake?

1367
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:59,480
(applause)

1368
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:12,080
