1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:02,406
(calm music)

2
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,650
(wind blowing)

3
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,001
(dramatic music)

4
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,319
- Well, hello.

5
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:50,120
- Hey.

6
00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:58,161
- Thank you for accepting my offer.

7
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:00,697
I appreciate it.

8
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:03,733
Please, come in.

9
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,007
I just want you to relax, okay?

10
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:14,177
I'm just going to put some
drops in one of your eyes.

11
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:16,880
So if you just want to sit
down and tip your head back.

12
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,684
- You sure you wouldn't
want to rather screw, Doc?

13
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:23,587
'Cause I mean, like, my rates
are the same no matter what.

14
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:27,390
- (laughs) No, that's quite all right.

15
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,193
I really just want the
use of one of your eyes.

16
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:31,061
Okay.

17
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,229
Now you're going to feel a little warmth

18
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,296
when I put some of the drops in,

19
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:35,365
so if you want to just take a seat?

20
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:40,937
Just lean back a little bit for me.

21
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:42,239
Excellent.

22
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,573
Now don't move.

23
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,407
Okay.

24
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:54,150
Excellent.

25
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,019
Okay, now in a few moments,

26
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,154
when the solution starts to take effect,

27
00:01:58,154 --> 00:02:00,857
I'm going to ask you to
look in this device, okay?

28
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:01,691
And then I want you

29
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:06,096
to very simply just
describe to me what you see.

30
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:06,930
Relax.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,133
This is just an experiment in perception.

32
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,135
- Yeah, yeah, right.

33
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:14,104
- Through the use of these
chemicals and this device,

34
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:17,040
you may very well be the
first person in human history

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,809
to actually perceive the eighth dimension.

36
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,444
- The eighth dimension?
(thumping)

37
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:23,747
- Yes, the eighth dimension.

38
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:31,788
Oh, don't worry about
that, that's just my wife.

39
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:34,324
Now in a few moments,

40
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:37,027
the eye drops should start to take effect.

41
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:41,798
You're going to feel a kind
of warm tingling in your eye.

42
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,511
You listening to me?

43
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:58,315
- I have a warm tingling in my thighs.

44
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:01,818
Gotcha.

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,190
- Right in the middle of
something, sweetheart.

46
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:09,426
- He's cute.

47
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:12,329
I hope you don't blind
him like the last one.

48
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:13,697
- That was just a little, a little joke.

49
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:15,699
Will you excuse me for a second?

50
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,700
Just tip your head back

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,069
and tell me when it starts to tingle.

52
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:24,240
I told you, Rita, don't speak like that

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,809
in front of the subjects.

54
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,877
Besides, I promised you that
would never happen again.

55
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:28,845
- Yeah, well, it better not.

56
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:30,513
You know, I'm tired of paying
for this hospital shit.

57
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:32,515
Every time somebody gets
hurt, I have to pay.

58
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,117
Your experiments, I have to pay.

59
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,986
The assistant down the hall, my money.

60
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:37,821
I feel like I'm supporting
a third world country here.

61
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:38,788
- Yeah, well, it's an investment.

62
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:39,656
Besides, I told you,

63
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:41,658
it's all going to be worth it in the end.

64
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:44,327
(ominous music)

65
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:48,231
- Yeah, you were supposed to
be rich and famous by now,

66
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,566
you know, at least have that grant money

67
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,301
to pay me back for some of this shit?

68
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:52,769
- You know, first I
actually have to graduate

69
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,005
from med school, then I
have to win the grant.

70
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:58,441
- Doc?

71
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,645
Think I'm ready.

72
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:06,216
Let's look through this
lens thing over here.

73
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,786
- Well, Jesus, I'm close to
a major breakthrough, Rita.

74
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:11,354
I mean, what else do you want from me?

75
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:12,188
- What else do I want?

76
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:13,690
How about sex?

77
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,725
- We had sex last Thursday.

78
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:19,029
- Jordan, I told you when we
got married, I need attention.

79
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,865
- Rita, I'm under a severe
amount of pressure right now.

80
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:33,109
(thunder crashes)

81
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:35,111
(gasps)

82
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:56,399
- You know,

83
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,002
I don't think I've ever even
truly experienced an orgasm.

84
00:04:59,002 --> 00:04:59,836
- Now?

85
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:01,671
I mean, you want to talk

86
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,107
about you and your orgasms right now?

87
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,342
- Well, we can't talk about
it in the bedroom, now can we?

88
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:07,177
- Look, Rita.

89
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,747
I'm working with a test subject right now.

90
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,888
(groaning)

91
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:39,375
- You know, all I know is is
you have a pretty hot wife

92
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,678
who pretty much pays your way.

93
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:45,115
All she asks in return
is a little attention.

94
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,294
- Listen, why don't
you go for a walk, huh?

95
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:00,764
Go and visit the neighbors.

96
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:02,499
That always seems to cool you down.

97
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,473
(energy crackling)

98
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:49,879
God, his eye.

99
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,334
(dramatic music)

100
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:13,990
- [Man] Dude, I bought this off this guy

101
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,192
with this killer van down by this beach.

102
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,195
- Man, that shit looks like Bufferin, man.

103
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,863
- No way, it's like crystal meth,

104
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,198
crystal meth if you like mixed it

105
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:24,033
with Flintstones chewable vitamins.

106
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,234
- Yeah?

107
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:26,069
That man is pretty cool, man.

108
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,437
He's a dope motherfucker, man.

109
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:31,274
- Anyways, let's you see
things no one else can see,

110
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:32,709
do things no one else can do.

111
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:42,118
- So how long's this shit last, man?

112
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:43,386
- All night.

113
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,561
(thumps)

114
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:52,729
Did that hurt?

115
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:54,797
- Yeah, it did.

116
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:59,869
But just, just the right
side, just the right side.

117
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:00,970
- It's working.

118
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:04,240
- Is that the door?

119
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,577
Or did I just hit myself again, man?

120
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,679
- Joe baby, Tom baby.

121
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,448
How are my two favorite
bachelors this evening?

122
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:15,151
- Bad, we're as stoned as stoned can be.

123
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:16,686
- Oh, business as usual.

124
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:18,855
- Hey, baby.

125
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,759
How about a little appetizer?

126
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,161
- Well, I'll just skip to the main course.

127
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,230
- Hello, Mrs. Grady.

128
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,998
Are you trying to seduce us?

129
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:32,602
- Well, I have a very special
favor to ask you guys.

130
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:34,937
- Another special favor.

131
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,908
- We did two special
favors for you last week.

132
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:42,278
- Well, I'm high maintenance.

133
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:43,579
- You sure your husband's okay with this?

134
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,748
I mean, the three of us?

135
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:48,151
- Well, he did say he
wants me to be happy.

136
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:50,253
So make me happy.

137
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,357
(ominous music)

138
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:01,130
(bed creaking)

139
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,569
- They're at it again.

140
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,738
- Yeah, but tonight we
don't have to hear it.

141
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:09,906
- So this is real.

142
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,641
We're really going to go out.

143
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:14,477
- A promise is a promise.

144
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:16,245
- Even if it is a month late.

145
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:17,947
- Look, I've been trying to get away

146
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,549
but you know Grady.

147
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,516
- Unfortunately.

148
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,052
- He helps pay the bills.

149
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,355
- His wife pays the bills,

150
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,691
but that doesn't make you his slave.

151
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:29,525
- Jane.

152
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:34,497
- Just remember who
you're married to, okay?

153
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:35,331
- It's not that bad.

154
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:36,499
You make it sound

155
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,367
like I'm at his beck
and call 24 hours a day.

156
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:42,004
- I need your assistance
up in the lab immediately.

157
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,606
- Dr. Grady.

158
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:45,374
Jane and I were just on our way out.

159
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:46,642
- Can it wait?

160
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,478
This is gonna take a couple of minutes.

161
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,416
- I'll be right back, I promise.

162
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,419
(kisses)

163
00:11:58,221 --> 00:12:00,356
- Oh, Jane, have you
seen my wife anywhere?

164
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:02,658
- No, no.

165
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:13,102
- [Jordan] See, I just need
a couple pairs of hands

166
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:14,570
to help lift this, okay?

167
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:16,572
- What is that?

168
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:17,440
- [Jordan] What?

169
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,641
- That, the dead body.

170
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:22,145
- That's just a cadaver I
borrowed from the hospital.

171
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:23,846
- A clothed cadaver?

172
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:24,680
- Yes.

173
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:26,749
I mean, no.

174
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,151
I put the old work clothes on it

175
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:28,985
because I didn't want to embarrass Rita

176
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:30,953
by bringing a naked dead cadaver home.

177
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:32,622
You understand?

178
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:35,191
- Yeah, sure, it happens all the time.

179
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:37,293
What happened to his eye?

180
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:38,794
- How do I know what happened to his eye?

181
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:41,097
The guy came like that, didn't he?

182
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:43,266
Probably lost it in a
knife fight with Boxcar Bob

183
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:44,133
over a pack of cheese snacks

184
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,035
or whatever these street kids do nowadays.

185
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,639
- No, see, this is a recent wound.

186
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,074
Like the ocular cavity got burst outwards.

187
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:55,545
It's as if the eye got,
I dunno, pushed out.

188
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:58,981
- All right, well, thanks,
Morton, for the autopsy report.

189
00:12:58,981 --> 00:12:59,815
But if you don't mind,

190
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,450
I'm going to pretend like this is my lab

191
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,986
and this is my cadaver and,
yes, you're my employee.

192
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:05,922
So let's just take it from there, okay?

193
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:07,757
- Sorry.

194
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:08,758
- Fine.

195
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,826
Just grab his feet and let's
hoist him into the crate.

196
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:11,661
Come on.

197
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:13,996
Okay.

198
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:16,232
(grunts)

199
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:18,901
No, okay, lift your end up a little bit.

200
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:19,902
There we go.

201
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:23,639
(slow music)

202
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:59,709
(energy crackling)

203
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,202
- Man, I need some rest,
I'm totally tapped.

204
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,138
- That's it?

205
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:11,407
- [Man] Me too.

206
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:15,010
- Amateurs.

207
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:24,487
- So how is the experiment
coming anyway, Doc?

208
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:25,421
Working pretty late tonight.

209
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:26,255
- No, well,

210
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:29,525
I probably shouldn't say
anything right now but...

211
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:33,195
- You had a breakthrough
with the apparatus?

212
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:34,797
- The tests are not conclusive

213
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:38,701
so, well, not yet anyway, but yeah, yeah.

214
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:40,669
- Wow.

215
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,171
Well, that's great.

216
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,706
Now you can get that five-year grant.

217
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:44,907
- At least, at least.

218
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:47,777
- Well, what did the subject see?

219
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:50,479
Did you open up a visual
path to the eighth dimension?

220
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:53,582
- I didn't get a chance
to ask him that yet.

221
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,486
- Well, how's the subject
doing health wise?

222
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:58,754
- I think he's doing great.

223
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:02,691
- Oh, shit!

224
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:03,526
- Oh, come on.

225
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:05,094
I mean, it's not like
I just said to myself,

226
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:05,928
hey, what am I going to do?

227
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,930
I might as well just kill
this guy for the hell of it.

228
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,199
Accidents happen and
you know that, Morton.

229
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,467
- What happened to his eye?

230
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:14,069
- I don't know what happened to his eye.

231
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,137
And maybe that's the tricky part.

232
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:16,839
Maybe the chemicals and the...

233
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,074
Maybe they dissolved it?

234
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:20,176
- Oh, and that's your big breakthrough?

235
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:21,677
- No, that's not my big breakthrough.

236
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:24,547
Look, Morton, something
happened in that lab, okay?

237
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:25,414
I mean, I had to step out for a while,

238
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:28,017
so I wasn't able to see what happened

239
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:30,286
but the scope showed that
there was a definite flux

240
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:31,120
in that dimensional wall

241
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,721
when the kid looked through the eyepiece.

242
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:33,956
I mean, a big flux.

243
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:34,957
- Wow!

244
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:36,425
- Jesus Christ.

245
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:37,593
- Scare you?

246
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:38,661
- Yeah, you did scare me.

247
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,995
You know, it's funny how when
you just walk up to an attic,

248
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:40,830
you don't sort of expect

249
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,231
to find someone there waiting for you.

250
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,600
- Oh, geez, I'm real
sorry about that one, Doc.

251
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,168
Just up here in my thinking place.

252
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:47,903
I hear voices, here I come.

253
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:50,339
- What were you thinking about?

254
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,340
- Please, don't ask him that.

255
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,843
- Death and life and
elective brain surgery

256
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:57,146
and how maybe, just maybe,
they all kind of fit together

257
00:17:57,146 --> 00:18:00,082
like a jigsaw puzzle.

258
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:03,118
Hey, not the religious
type, just makes you think.

259
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:06,889
- (laughs) That's a doozy.

260
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,624
But if you don't mind,

261
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:09,825
Morton and I were just up
here delivering the crate,

262
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:11,160
so if you'd excuse us, please.

263
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,994
- Oh, yeah.

264
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:15,231
Let me give you just a
little something to chew on

265
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:16,499
on that, huh?

266
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:17,333
Get rid of it.

267
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,901
Throw the whole shebang in the trash,

268
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,136
let municipal waste take care of it.

269
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,404
Life's too short, you
know what I'm saying?

270
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:23,239
- Yeah, you know what, Bill,

271
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,540
is there not a wall you
could be staring at?

272
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,875
- Sure, sure.

273
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,476
- Yeah, we better be
getting back to the lab.

274
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,444
- See you around, fellas.

275
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:30,513
Should find that wall.

276
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:35,217
(dramatic music)

277
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:39,588
(energy crackling)

278
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,590
(screams)

279
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,226
- The hell are you screaming about?

280
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:09,364
What was it, a bug?

281
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:14,036
You know, you really need to
cut down on the drug intake.

282
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,073
- Tom?

283
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:21,443
Dude, you're wasted.

284
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:25,013
I'm seeing shit.

285
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,890
- Look, Doc, I appreciate
you making me your assistant

286
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,592
and all, you know that,
but I don't think it's fair

287
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,093
for you to make me an
accessory after the fact to a-

288
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:41,663
- One of the greatest discoveries
in the history of science.

289
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:44,066
You do understand that's what
we're talking about, right?

290
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,968
- All that mumbo-jumbo
about the eighth dimension?

291
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:46,802
Yeah, sure.

292
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:48,237
But meanwhile, you get a
dead kid's body stashed

293
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:49,905
up in the attic with Creepy Bill

294
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:51,974
and you don't even know if he
saw anything before he died.

295
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:54,143
- He did see something.

296
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:54,977
- Huh?

297
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:59,047
- Look, between 8:15 and 8:23,
I was out of the room, okay?

298
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,683
But at 8:18, so according to the scopes,

299
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:03,218
that kid felt the tingling in his eye

300
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,587
and he came and looked
through this device.

301
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:06,688
- How do you know that?

302
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:07,523
- How do I know that?

303
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:08,724
I'll tell you exactly how I know that.

304
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:10,726
Because at 8:18, the dimensional space

305
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:13,595
around this apparatus was
no longer perfectly curved.

306
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:14,563
There was a whole hole in it for,

307
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:16,198
I don't know, maybe five seconds.

308
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,934
- So you're telling me that
that kid punched a hole

309
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:20,502
through our reality with his eye?

310
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:23,705
- Yeah, and the chemicals
and the radiation.

311
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:25,741
I mean, you can't forget that, Morton.

312
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:26,575
But you know what?

313
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:27,876
That is not the sexy part.

314
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,646
You want to know the sexy part?

315
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:31,780
Something came through.

316
00:23:33,782 --> 00:23:35,317
- Oh, shit.

317
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,151
- Absolutely.

318
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:38,654
And whatever it was triggered

319
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:40,689
those bioelectric scintillators
there on the table

320
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:43,292
and they act like sort of Geiger counters,

321
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:45,327
that track audible biofeedback.

322
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:47,329
Now, if that is the case, we can use them

323
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,665
to go and track down
our new little visitor.

324
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:51,767
And you and I, Morton, can
have empirical evidence

325
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,536
that the eighth dimension actually exists.

326
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,471
Now it went somewhere
through the vent, okay,

327
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:57,573
and if that is the case,

328
00:23:57,573 --> 00:23:59,441
it's going to be anywhere
in this building.

329
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:02,010
Okay, so I want you to go
and check all the apartments

330
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,345
and I'm just going to stay here

331
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:04,980
and I'm going to start
processing the data we've got

332
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,582
since the dimensional wall was open.

333
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:08,750
- Whoa, just hold on a minute here, Doc.

334
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,419
This thing comes out of God knows where

335
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:11,787
and it probably ate the kid's eyeball.

336
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,021
- We don't know that.

337
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:16,258
- In any event, we're out of
our league here, Doc, way out.

338
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:17,593
- Look, whatever came through,

339
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:19,461
came through that eyepiece there.

340
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:22,231
It could not be bigger than a marble.

341
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:23,065
Okay?

342
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:25,033
How dangerous could that be?

343
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,703
(ominous music)

344
00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:33,976
- Back in a minute?

345
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:37,613
(sighs) I'm gonna kill him!

346
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,695
(energy crackling)

347
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:26,328
(slow music)

348
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,602
(energy crackling)

349
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:18,880
- So I made a mistake.

350
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,782
I was looking for a couple of boys

351
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,618
when I should've been
looking for a couple of men.

352
00:26:23,618 --> 00:26:25,620
- Yeah, Tom's really out of it this time.

353
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,222
What did you do to him?

354
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:28,890
- What did I do to him?

355
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,392
What about all that shit
you guys are always taking?

356
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:32,427
I mean, it's a wonder
you both aren't dead.

357
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:35,364
- No, see, I really truly saw something.

358
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:38,066
- You know, you guys are
always seeing something.

359
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,501
- Hi, everyone.

360
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:40,936
Sorry to barge in like this.

361
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:44,873
Didn't expect to find you here,

362
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,342
especially with all your
clothes on like that.

363
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:48,176
- Funny, Morton.

364
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:50,712
What's going on?

365
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,081
- I'm looking for something.

366
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:57,352
Hey, Joe, Tom, how's it going?

367
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:59,621
- Man, I think Tom's
braindead or something.

368
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:00,989
- Hey, that's great.

369
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:02,624
Two more satisfied customers.

370
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:05,761
- You know, you used to be fun, remember?

371
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:07,562
I mean, before Ms. Morton showed up?

372
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,632
- It's that pesky monogamy thing.

373
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,634
- It's just a ring and a license.

374
00:27:12,634 --> 00:27:14,870
Nothing two people
can't work out somewhere

375
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,271
in a nice dark room.

376
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:19,141
- I'm working.

377
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:22,444
- Don't forget who writes
the checks, sweetie.

378
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:24,613
- Dude, she wants it.

379
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,649
- You just don't let up, do you?

380
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,751
- It's just part of my charm.

381
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:32,120
- As hard as this might
be for you to believe,

382
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,655
I actually love my wife, okay?

383
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:34,489
- Yeah?

384
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,024
So where's Janie now?

385
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:42,330
(slow music)
(energy crackling)

386
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,772
(Jane gasps)

387
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:30,212
- What do you know about
biofeedback radiation?

388
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:32,948
- About as much as I know
about going stag to the prom.

389
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,418
- Anyway, that's what me and
Dr. Grady are looking for.

390
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:37,853
Remember him?

391
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:39,421
- Barely.

392
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:41,022
- Well, I'll make you a deal.

393
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:43,859
You climb off my back and maybe
I'll forget I saw you here

394
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,826
with the doobie brothers.

395
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:45,660
- Hey.

396
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:49,531
Oh, I think I'm getting your
machine there all excited.

397
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:52,100
I think it likes me.

398
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:58,106
(slow music)
(energy crackling)

399
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,847
Why don't we ditch this toy
and we can play like grownups?

400
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:25,020
- What is that, a dope detector?

401
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,820
- Is he okay?

402
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,856
I'm picking up some
really strange readings.

403
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:30,025
(screams)

404
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,612
- Wow, was that weird.

405
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:52,213
I felt like something just tried

406
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:54,082
to suck the life right out of me.

407
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:55,450
- What?

408
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,951
- Something's probably broken.

409
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:01,122
I'm gonna go see if the doc can fix it.

410
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:02,757
- See you around, tiger.

411
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:21,276
- God, this is gonna complicate matters.

412
00:32:23,144 --> 00:32:24,546
Fancy meeting you here, Bill,

413
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,314
just lurking around my apartment.

414
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:27,415
You know how much I'd
love to just sit down

415
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,483
and chew the fat with you,

416
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:30,418
but I'm afraid I just don't
have the time right now.

417
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:31,686
- We should talk, Doc.

418
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:33,321
- You know, maybe one day
we might just do that,

419
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:34,556
but just not today, okay?

420
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:39,094
- It's about that crate or, got
it, what's inside the crate.

421
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:42,397
- You looked in the crate?

422
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:45,200
- I'd say I had a little bit of a peek.

423
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:49,671
- Okay, let's talk.
- All right.

424
00:33:01,282 --> 00:33:04,219
(energy crackling)

425
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,956
(slow music)

426
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:11,393
- A few minutes, you said?

427
00:33:11,393 --> 00:33:13,261
Congratulations.

428
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:14,896
Another night shot to hell.

429
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:35,884
- Well, boys, the night's still young.

430
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:38,953
- Oh, baby, I'm really out of it.

431
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,055
- So?

432
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:43,358
It'll be like every other
time we get together.

433
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,128
- Don't think a little romance
is going to cheer me up.

434
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:49,664
I'm still mad at you.

435
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:54,769
(energy crackling)

436
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:07,615
Awfully sure of yourself.

437
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,284
It's not going to be that easy.

438
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:22,530
- Hey, what if that thing comes back?

439
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,032
- What thing?

440
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:25,467
- That thing that was
under the sheets with you.

441
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:26,935
I saw it.

442
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:28,770
- There was no thing, Joe.

443
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:31,506
- Forget it.

444
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:34,242
You're not going to touch this body

445
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:38,713
until I hear some begging and pleading.

446
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:56,998
God, you know just where to touch me.

447
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,070
(energy crackling)

448
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,335
Okay, you're forgiven.

449
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:38,640
- Look, honey, I know I
said I'd be right back

450
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,908
but you won't believe...

451
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:43,177
- What the hell?

452
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:44,379
What's behind me?

453
00:35:44,379 --> 00:35:46,047
- Don't turn around.

454
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:48,049
(gasps)

455
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,287
(energy crackling)

456
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,691
- Dude, you're so fried.

457
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,360
- So are you, man.

458
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,462
(laughs)

459
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:04,899
- You know what?

460
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,401
Forget it.

461
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:07,936
You guys are hopeless.

462
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:09,037
Color me (indistinct).

463
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:19,147
(dramatic music)
(energy crackling)

464
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:35,116
(lamp crashes)

465
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,551
- What exactly are we saying here, Bill?

466
00:38:38,386 --> 00:38:41,522
- Hey, Doc, I'm just saying,

467
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,524
finding a dead body in the attic,

468
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,327
that's some wacky shit, you know?

469
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:48,863
- So they say.

470
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:53,434
- And I was thinking that you

471
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:56,738
and Morton probably took it
up there in that big old crate

472
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,040
and maybe you had a reason.

473
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:04,011
- What have we got here, Bill,
a little bit of blackmail?

474
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:08,950
- Nope, no blackmail.

475
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:12,787
- What do you mean no blackmail?

476
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:16,691
- I'm just trying to clear things up, Doc.

477
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,426
You know, keep it copacetic.

478
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,162
- So you're just going
to go tell everyone?

479
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,331
- No!

480
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:24,665
Because when you tell on others,

481
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,868
you're really just
telling on yourself, Doc.

482
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,273
- How did I get here?

483
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:34,709
- Damned if I know.

484
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:39,147
The last thing I remember is...

485
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:41,883
Grady.

486
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,966
- We got to get one
thing clear then, okay?

487
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:01,502
We do not tell anyone.

488
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:04,639
- Anyone.

489
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,240
- Not just anyone.

490
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,110
Bill, we don't tell nobody.

491
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,944
- Nobody.

492
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,413
- And your lips are sealed?

493
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:13,581
- Lips are sealed, Doc.

494
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,519
- (laughs) You're okay with that?

495
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,687
- I'm as right as rain.

496
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:24,358
(energy crackling)

497
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:55,323
- Hey, where's that street
kid you brought home?

498
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:56,457
- Oh, he's up in the attic.

499
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:57,291
- Oh, thanks, Creepy Bill.

500
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,960
- Sure thing.

501
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,595
- What the hell did you tell her that for?

502
00:41:00,595 --> 00:41:01,796
- Geez, Doc.

503
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:03,698
Thought she already knew.

504
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:04,899
- No, she does not know.

505
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:10,171
- Hello?

506
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:11,072
My name's Rita.

507
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:14,408
I'm the Doc's wife?

508
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:15,243
Remember me?

509
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:25,453
(gasps) Shit, God, you
scared me half to death.

510
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:26,387
Don't do that.

511
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,322
Are you okay?

512
00:41:29,257 --> 00:41:31,792
What did my sicko husband
try to do this time?

513
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:34,862
God, you're cold as ice.

514
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:38,966
But you're kind of cute though.

515
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:41,736
- I.

516
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,538
I.

517
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:45,473
I.

518
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:46,707
- Oh, you're shy?

519
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:49,310
That's okay, I like shy.

520
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,678
- I stranger.

521
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:52,713
Stranger.

522
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:53,881
- Well, that's okay.

523
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:55,116
I like strangers too.

524
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:57,785
You know, you get to know somebody

525
00:41:57,785 --> 00:41:59,420
and you just get disappointed.

526
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:01,889
I like this.

527
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,592
Two people meet, they don't say a word.

528
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:06,427
- I.

529
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:10,431
I stranger world.

530
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,467
Need to make more.

531
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:16,070
Force to make more.

532
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,973
- (shushes) Just come to mama.

533
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,644
I like a man that gets right to the point.

534
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:33,087
You like that?

535
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,823
(dramatic music)

536
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:43,731
- My god.

537
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,333
- Well, he's alive.

538
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:47,201
- [Jordan] Well, maybe
he was pumped up on drugs

539
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,302
or something like that.

540
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:50,137
- That's good, drugs, that's good.

541
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:51,339
- But he could have been,

542
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:53,040
it's like angel dust
or something like that.

543
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,976
- Angel dust, every time.

544
00:42:54,976 --> 00:42:56,644
- He can pump him up with angel dust

545
00:42:56,644 --> 00:42:57,478
and you'd get someone who-

546
00:42:57,478 --> 00:43:00,548
- Oh, oh, hey, Doc, isn't
that the guy you killed

547
00:43:00,548 --> 00:43:02,550
and stuffed in the crate?

548
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,353
- [Jordan] This is nothing
like that, believe me.

549
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:07,421
- Hey, Doc,

550
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,256
what about the big son of a
bitch floating eyeball thing?

551
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:10,091
- What?

552
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:19,133
Rita.

553
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,471
Get away from my wife!

554
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:26,407
(energy crackling)

555
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:29,543
- Don't look into its eye.

556
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:30,911
- [Bill] Hey, it's all eye!

557
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:32,480
- Don't look at it.

558
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,288
- Does somebody have something to say?

559
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,390
Somebody who, oh, I don't know,

560
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,258
might have been doing
some eye experiments?

561
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,960
- You just wait a second, okay?

562
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,696
A few scarred retinas, some blindness.

563
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:50,664
Now that's the sort of stuff
I'm used to dealing with.

564
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:53,267
This whole giant eyeball
is a new one on me.

565
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:54,435
- Right, you're done.

566
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:55,903
- Hold on there one moment.

567
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:58,105
I think somebody needs a bit of time out.

568
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:00,041
- You know, I really thought
the Frankenstein was cute

569
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:03,444
when we got married, but frankly,
it's getting on my nerves.

570
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:04,378
- Morton, how did you find out

571
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:05,846
this thing was scared off by light?

572
00:44:05,846 --> 00:44:08,416
- By accident after it
tried feeling up my wife.

573
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:10,017
- Well, that sure is horny, huh?

574
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:11,085
I mean, for an eyeball, sorry.

575
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:13,554
- I don't get it, Doc, what
the hell is that thing?

576
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:15,656
- It's a creature from the
eighth dimension, Morton.

577
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:17,191
- Oh, please come off it.

578
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:19,760
- Hey, look, I wish I was kidding, okay?

579
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,929
But I must've opened up a
dimensional wall in reverse,

580
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:24,498
allowing something to come
through into our world.

581
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:27,501
And the first place it went to
was into that kid's eyeball.

582
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,070
- Oh, a possessed eyeball, of course.

583
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,505
Well, hey, makes perfect sense to me, Doc.

584
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,507
- Good, swell.

585
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:34,942
Any idea what we do now?

586
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:36,710
- I'm all for getting the
hell out of here, kids.

587
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,545
- Amen.

588
00:44:37,545 --> 00:44:39,080
- I agree, I think we
should call the police

589
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,614
or NASA or whoever.

590
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,249
We don't know what this creature is.

591
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:43,717
We do know one thing, it's not friendly.

592
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,353
- No, there's absolutely
no way we're going.

593
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,122
This is my experiment,
this is my discovery,

594
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,424
and I'm not letting some
greedy government glory hound

595
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:52,660
come in here and take it away.

596
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,028
- You know, it's been
nice knowing you, honey.

597
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:55,729
- Yeah, and you're not
going anywhere else either.

598
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:57,364
- [Rita] Yeah, just keep
telling yourself that.

599
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:58,232
- Oh, that would be a shame.

600
00:44:58,232 --> 00:44:59,934
You'll leave poor old
Dr. Grady here on his own

601
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:00,901
when the cops show up,

602
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:03,003
oh, and they find the street kid's body.

603
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:04,238
God, that would be a shame, wouldn't it?

604
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:06,774
Because yes, if you stop to
think about it for a second,

605
00:45:06,774 --> 00:45:08,442
you are in fact an accessory.

606
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:09,443
Of course.

607
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:10,845
It was all your inheritance money

608
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:12,012
that went towards financing

609
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:14,982
those so-called twisted
experiments and all.

610
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,450
Oh, damn.

611
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:20,254
Oh, and Morton, yes, it was
you who helped me lug the body

612
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:21,088
up into the attic.

613
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:24,625
And Bill, if I'm not mistaken, yes,

614
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,228
you were the one who tried to
blackmail me about the body.

615
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:28,395
So whether you like it or not,

616
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,997
we are all implicated in this.

617
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:32,299
And if the cops show up, we all go down.

618
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:33,467
- What do you want from us?

619
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:35,803
- No one leaves here
until I get my specimen.

620
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,975
Listen, it gets worse.

621
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:44,145
I did some tests on the ectoplasm
that I found by the vent

622
00:45:44,145 --> 00:45:45,212
and I believe this thing

623
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:47,915
in its full form is a hermaphrodite.

624
00:45:49,884 --> 00:45:51,452
That is to say that it
can reproduce asexually.

625
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:52,453
It's like an amoeba.

626
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,856
- So why is it attracted to the women?

627
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,658
- Maybe it's confused.

628
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:58,492
- Maybe it's just trying

629
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,127
to make little bitty, tiny eyeballs.

630
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,896
- Not if it's a hermaphrodite.

631
00:46:01,896 --> 00:46:02,730
It could just split a piece of itself off

632
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,532
or be born pregnant,

633
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:06,100
which is all the more reason
we should stay away from it.

634
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,369
I mean, who knows what this
thing is going to do next?

635
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:10,371
- True, it is a hermaphrodite.

636
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,040
But maybe only a small
part of it came through.

637
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,542
Maybe that was the male part.

638
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:17,311
And if that is the case,

639
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,713
it's most likely to be looking for females

640
00:46:19,713 --> 00:46:20,614
to reproduce with.

641
00:46:22,016 --> 00:46:23,417
All the more reason why
we've got to find it,

642
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,219
we've got to put it in a controlled space.

643
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,788
- You know, Jordan, maybe
you should just marry it.

644
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,224
- That reminds me, where's Jane?

645
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:31,058
- Oh, she's safe.

646
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:33,160
She's asleep back at my place.

647
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,528
I don't think she really
remembers what happened

648
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:36,163
and I'd like to keep it that way.

649
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:39,900
(ominous music)

650
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,386
- What about the light?

651
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:01,455
- Well, that actually is the good news.

652
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:02,723
By possessing a human eye,

653
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:04,959
it's confined to the
limitations of an eye.

654
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,128
Now, as we all know, looking
into bright lights is painful

655
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,631
but it's exactly the same thing for it.

656
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:11,732
Looking into bright lights,

657
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:14,635
or rather the heat
generated by bright lights,

658
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:16,103
it can dry an eye out.

659
00:47:16,103 --> 00:47:18,606
Now an eye needs to be
moist in order to function.

660
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:22,009
And it gets its energy
from living brain cells.

661
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:25,179
So what I'm thinking is prolonged periods

662
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,448
without active brain matter to nourish it

663
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:31,518
coupled with bright lights
and heat, it could just-

664
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:32,886
- Kill it.

665
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:34,722
- Possibly, yes.

666
00:47:34,722 --> 00:47:36,056
- Oh hell, it's been floating around here

667
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:36,924
and fucking for hours.

668
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:38,859
It's gotta be getting tired.

669
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,262
(slow music)

670
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:47,935
- This movie's brilliantly directed.

671
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,304
- This is a movie?

672
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:53,073
Man, I thought it was real.

673
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,910
- Dude, you're so fried.

674
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,979
- Let me tell you something, man.

675
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:03,417
If I saw a monster coming
at me, I'd kick his ass.

676
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:04,351
- Damn right.

677
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,452
I'd shoot him.

678
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:08,889
- [Tom] You don't have a gun.

679
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,024
- I'd still shoot it.

680
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:13,560
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

681
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,395
- Then go.

682
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:19,767
Not here, in the bathroom,
go in the bathroom.

683
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:30,611
- Well, what about when it
was in the street kid's head?

684
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:32,413
I mean, didn't that like recharge it?

685
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:34,581
- No, no, the kid was already dead.

686
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,884
There was no active brain cells.

687
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:40,054
It needs active brain cells
in order to energize it.

688
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:41,588
- And how does it pull that off?

689
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:52,166
- Hey, Tom, this movie's
getting really good.

690
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:54,935
(dramatic music)

691
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:21,729
Hi.

692
00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:23,464
Want some drugs, man?

693
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:28,001
(energy crackling)

694
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,912
(water running)

695
00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:41,582
(ominous music)

696
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:55,629
- What'd I miss?

697
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:59,099
- Need female.

698
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,101
Need more.

699
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:02,903
- Yeah, right.

700
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:06,240
- Where's females?

701
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:09,476
- There's one on the tube.

702
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:25,192
Man, you are beyond fried, bro.

703
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,371
- Not real girl.

704
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:39,907
- If you want the real thing, man,

705
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:41,542
why don't you go find Rita?

706
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:42,443
- Where?

707
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,280
- Think she went upstairs, man.

708
00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:52,252
Oh, man.

709
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:53,253
Hey, just make sure

710
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:55,556
you don't bring her back down here, okay?

711
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:56,890
Trying to watch this movie.

712
00:50:57,858 --> 00:50:58,959
- [Joe] Okay.

713
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:10,437
- [Morton] How are we
going to catch this eye?

714
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:11,638
- Well, we're going to get Joe and Tom,

715
00:51:11,638 --> 00:51:13,540
and then the six of us are
going to search this building

716
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,374
from top to bottom.

717
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:16,510
- All right, good, good, good, all right.

718
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,578
Do we get guns?

719
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:19,580
- No, I'm going to give
each of you a light.

720
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,414
- And then what?

721
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:23,217
- And then we either
trap it or we kill it.

722
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:25,285
- Well, why don't we just send
it back to its own dimension?

723
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:26,820
I mean, having something
that powerful hanging around

724
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,555
in our world might be dangerous.

725
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:31,859
- Nothing worth going after,
Morton, is easy or safe.

726
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,160
- Thanks for the fortune cookie, Grady,

727
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,662
but we don't know what this thing can do.

728
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:37,698
- Joe, what great timing.

729
00:51:37,698 --> 00:51:39,967
We thought you could
help us on a little hunt.

730
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:43,637
We're looking for something,
actually a big something.

731
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:45,038
- No, wait, I got a better idea.

732
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:47,140
I think someone should be
with my wife just in case.

733
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,041
- Hey, I'll do it.

734
00:51:49,076 --> 00:51:50,644
- Joe, I want you to go downstairs

735
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:52,045
and keep Jane company, okay?

736
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,949
Remember Jane, my wife,
the woman I live with?

737
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:58,685
Okay, good.

738
00:51:58,685 --> 00:52:00,454
Here's the keys, go down to my apartment,

739
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,356
lock the door behind you,
and don't let anything in

740
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,992
until we come and tell
you it's safe, okay?

741
00:52:04,992 --> 00:52:06,260
- Okay.

742
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,528
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

743
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:11,098
(ominous music)

744
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,367
- Who's that?

745
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:51,471
Joe?

746
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,677
Where's my husband?

747
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:58,478
- Upstairs.

748
00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:02,082
- Did he say when he'd be back?

749
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:09,556
That's awfully sweet, Joe.

750
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:13,427
I think I'm all right now.

751
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:17,364
It's like I had some
kind of weird bad dream.

752
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:24,137
Do you think that you can get
me a glass of water, please?

753
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,308
(ominous music)

754
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:07,581
- Well, there is one
good thing about this.

755
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:09,049
- Yeah, what's that?

756
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:09,950
- Can't bite us.

757
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:12,719
- I guess that's true.

758
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,221
- Yeah.

759
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:16,857
Oh, can't shoot us either.

760
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:20,193
- Also true.

761
00:54:20,193 --> 00:54:21,695
- Good, good, all right.

762
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,966
So therefore, I was thinking
that, you know, maybe we live

763
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:29,803
and let live and let the slimy
little creature do his thing,

764
00:54:29,803 --> 00:54:32,673
we do our thing, ne'er
the twain shall meet.

765
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,642
- [Morton] Yeah, that's
a swell idea, Bill.

766
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:39,312
- [Bill] Maybe he's missed it.

767
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,481
- [Morton] I doubt it.

768
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:45,585
- Maybe he's hiding in
the best place of 'em all.

769
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:48,922
- Where's that?

770
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:50,924
- Right under our noses.

771
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:54,961
- It's not up here.

772
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:58,899
Let's split.

773
00:54:58,899 --> 00:55:00,400
- All right, good.

774
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:09,843
- Hey, hey, quit that!

775
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:11,912
- See anything peculiar around here?

776
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:14,281
- Yeah.

777
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:16,450
- Right, dumb question.

778
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:20,620
- [Tom] What are you looking for anyway?

779
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,589
- [Rita] The killer eye.

780
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:23,990
- [Tom] The killer what?

781
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,125
- Killer eye.

782
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:28,161
It's this big eyeball floating
around, diddling everybody.

783
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:29,796
(laughs)

784
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:31,498
- I don't know anything
about a killer eye,

785
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,700
but right now I got a killer buzz.

786
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:36,803
- You're pathetic.

787
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:39,039
- Hey, you can't just come in here,

788
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,707
call me names like that.

789
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:42,109
I'm telling Joe.

790
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,844
Where is he anyway?

791
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:45,846
- He's next door keeping an eye on Jane.

792
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,417
(footsteps thumping)

793
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,086
(ominous music)

794
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:04,765
- Thank you.

795
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:10,003
What are you doing?

796
00:56:10,003 --> 00:56:11,338
- [Joe] Massage.

797
00:56:13,807 --> 00:56:16,243
- Something awfully familiar about this.

798
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:20,046
Morton would wring your
neck if he caught you.

799
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:21,848
Mine too.

800
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,785
- [Joe] Roll over.

801
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,855
- Listen, Joe, you're a really nice guy

802
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:33,360
but I love my husband, understand?

803
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,495
(screams)

804
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:38,865
Somebody help me!

805
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:39,699
Somebody!

806
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:46,139
- You killed my best
friend, you stupid bitch!

807
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:48,175
- It doesn't seem to be
growing very weak to me.

808
00:56:48,175 --> 00:56:49,609
- Jane.

809
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:50,443
- I'm okay.

810
00:56:51,678 --> 00:56:52,512
- But it's not any weaker

811
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,648
'cause he's got a recharge
on Joe's brain matter.

812
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:57,284
- [Tom] What's that mean?

813
00:56:57,284 --> 00:57:00,520
- It means your friend's
brain has been sucked dry.

814
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,354
- Is he going to be okay?

815
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:03,023
- He's dead, you moron.

816
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:04,057
- This is serious.

817
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:05,992
It's killing people,
it's attacking the women.

818
00:57:05,992 --> 00:57:07,861
We can't afford to play around
with this thing anymore, Doc,

819
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:10,831
we gotta call somebody, dead
body in the attic or not.

820
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:13,066
- What the hell is going on around here?

821
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:14,768
- Okay, okay, look.

822
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:16,169
Let's just head out
for the front entrance.

823
00:57:16,169 --> 00:57:17,003
- I don't think we're going to make it

824
00:57:17,003 --> 00:57:17,838
to the front entrance.

825
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:19,105
I mean, this eye could be
waiting for us anywhere.

826
00:57:19,105 --> 00:57:20,640
- No, no, no, look, look.

827
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,842
We all stick together,
we keep the lights on,

828
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,877
and we definitely have the advantage here.

829
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:26,513
Oh God, what the hell is that?

830
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:28,648
- So much for the advantage.

831
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:29,583
- Oh my God.

832
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,984
- Very diabolical.

833
00:57:30,984 --> 00:57:32,652
- No, wait, just relax.

834
00:57:32,652 --> 00:57:34,754
Wait, I have a backup
power supply for the lab

835
00:57:34,754 --> 00:57:36,489
and it's on its own separate line.

836
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:37,457
The breaker box is in the attic.

837
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:40,126
Okay, look, everyone, just
get, get back to the lab, okay?

838
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:41,561
- What about you?

839
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:42,395
- This is my mess.

840
00:57:42,395 --> 00:57:44,164
I'm going to go and hit the breaker.

841
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:45,332
- Jordan.
- What?

842
00:57:45,332 --> 00:57:46,399
- Take care, huh?

843
00:57:58,178 --> 00:57:59,746
- I've got an idea.

844
00:58:05,452 --> 00:58:08,088
- Thank heaven for small miracles.

845
00:58:08,088 --> 00:58:13,093
(dramatic music)
(energy crackling)

846
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:49,262
- What the hell is this thing?

847
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:50,597
How did this all happen?

848
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:52,499
- It was a fluke.

849
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:56,036
The original experimental design
was to simply allow the eye

850
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:57,904
of the test subject to
see through the barrier

851
00:58:57,904 --> 00:59:00,573
of our reality into the eighth dimension.

852
00:59:00,573 --> 00:59:01,408
- Eighth dimension?
- Eighth dimension?

853
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:04,344
- It's a hypothetical plane of reality.

854
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:06,613
Alternate universe.

855
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:07,981
- [Bill] Like New Jersey.

856
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:10,350
- Anyway, Doc Grady
was working on eyedrops

857
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,519
that would allow us to see the other side.

858
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:15,322
But I guess somehow it all got reversed

859
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:18,091
and something broke into our
world from the other side.

860
00:59:19,259 --> 00:59:20,927
- Sure likes our Earth women.

861
00:59:22,462 --> 00:59:24,898
- Yeah, they killed my buddy Joe.

862
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:27,901
Why couldn't they have
just taken me instead?

863
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:28,935
- Are we just going to sit around here

864
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:30,437
until the lights go out again?

865
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:34,741
- No, I'm sure Doc Grady will
have a plan when he gets back.

866
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:38,745
But if he doesn't, then
I say we set a trap.

867
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:39,579
- A trap?

868
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:41,748
- Like a mouse trap.

869
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:43,450
- Like a light trap.

870
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,485
If we could somehow surround
it with a series of lights

871
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:47,554
all set at the right spectrum

872
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:49,489
and then keep it in that one
particular spot long enough

873
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:50,957
for it to dry out and destroy it.

874
00:59:50,957 --> 00:59:53,259
- How are we going to keep it in one spot?

875
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:54,828
- I haven't figured that out yet.

876
00:59:56,196 --> 00:59:57,030
- Hey, lookie there.

877
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,299
Hey, Doc, we're just
sitting around talking

878
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:01,301
about setting a trap for the eye.

879
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:03,103
- Oh, you don't say?

880
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:05,305
Just so happens I had
exactly the same idea.

881
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:08,108
And I have a little backup.

882
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:09,509
Cross dimensional time bomb.

883
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:11,544
- Come again?

884
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:14,247
- I didn't want to mention anything before

885
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:15,682
'cause it's a little bit
of a drastic measure.

886
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:19,819
But I believe if I can coerce
the eye into a small space,

887
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:22,088
set off the bomb, I can
destroy the creature.

888
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:24,290
Probably about five or
six city blocks as well.

889
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,725
- Yeah, but the thing we
couldn't figure out is

890
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:28,228
what are we going to use for bait?

891
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:29,129
- You.

892
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:30,597
- [Rita] What?

893
01:00:30,597 --> 01:00:32,866
- We find somewhere dark like the attic

894
01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:35,435
where we know the eye is sure to show up.

895
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:37,604
We know it's obviously attracted to you.

896
01:00:37,604 --> 01:00:39,572
- Yeah, I'm real flattered but...

897
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:43,510
- When it does show up,
we exit, trap the eye,

898
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,845
lock the door, set up the bomb.

899
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:47,814
- [Morton] And run like hell, I hope.

900
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:50,016
- We'll have about five minutes
before the bomb goes off

901
01:00:50,016 --> 01:00:50,850
and that should give us enough time

902
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,019
to be outside of the bomb blast radius.

903
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:54,287
- And what if it isn't?

904
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,122
- Quite frankly, the
explosion would be so huge,

905
01:00:56,122 --> 01:00:57,891
you wouldn't even feel or see a thing.

906
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:02,095
So Rita and I are going
to go up to the attic.

907
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:03,897
I want the rest of you to stay right here

908
01:01:03,897 --> 01:01:06,966
and don't move until we
have trapped the eye.

909
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:07,934
You got that?

910
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:10,070
- What if I got to take a pee?

911
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:11,838
- You hold it.

912
01:01:13,873 --> 01:01:16,543
(ominous music)

913
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:23,583
- Jordan, I'm scared.

914
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,653
- Don't be afraid, I wouldn't
let anything happen to you.

915
01:01:26,653 --> 01:01:29,389
- You know, I have a confession to make.

916
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:32,225
I mean, since we might be
getting blown to bits and all.

917
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:34,794
I haven't been the most
faithful wife in the world.

918
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:35,628
- I know.

919
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:39,232
- And you know, you haven't
been the most loving husband.

920
01:01:39,232 --> 01:01:41,468
- I know that too.

921
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:44,003
- And I was thinking maybe
we should get a divorce.

922
01:01:46,106 --> 01:01:48,174
(kisses)

923
01:01:50,577 --> 01:01:51,678
Wow.

924
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:52,712
- That good for you?

925
01:01:52,712 --> 01:01:53,713
- Real good.

926
01:02:00,153 --> 01:02:02,155
(moans)

927
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:03,890
It's never been like this.

928
01:02:18,938 --> 01:02:19,906
(gasps)

929
01:02:19,906 --> 01:02:21,708
- Don't be afraid, Rita.

930
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:22,876
It's not an evil being.

931
01:02:23,877 --> 01:02:25,678
It let me look into its mind.

932
01:02:25,678 --> 01:02:27,080
- What did it just do to me?

933
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,650
- It has certain needs and
it asked me to help it.

934
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,886
And in exchange, it's going to help me.

935
01:02:32,886 --> 01:02:34,587
And so I did it.

936
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:36,089
I did it, Rita.

937
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,358
It's going to show me how
to open up a real portal

938
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:39,559
to the eighth dimension.

939
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,562
I mean, isn't this great?

940
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,931
A whole world full of these
little guys everywhere you look?

941
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:46,733
- What are you talking about?

942
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:48,268
- This eye.

943
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:49,502
It's not here by accident.

944
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:52,572
I mean, he's here as an advance scout

945
01:02:52,572 --> 01:02:54,374
from the invasion fleet.

946
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:56,176
These guys want to move in.

947
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:57,277
- Oh yeah?

948
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:58,878
You better tell your new
buddy the eyeball here,

949
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:00,480
it's gonna be awfully hard
for him to take over the world

950
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,415
with one of my three inch
spike heels sticking out

951
01:03:02,415 --> 01:03:03,883
of his yucky fucking face!

952
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:09,589
(slurps)

953
01:03:11,824 --> 01:03:13,927
(groans)

954
01:03:17,497 --> 01:03:19,365
- Oh, yeah, there.

955
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:21,634
Hey, this looks like

956
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:24,971
that intergalactic bomb thing the Doc had.

957
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:29,042
- Not quite though, it's a stopwatch.

958
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:31,477
- Oh, well, like I said,

959
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:33,880
it looks like the bomb thing the Doc had.

960
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:36,950
- Oh my God.

961
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:39,018
- The whole thing was bullshit.

962
01:03:39,018 --> 01:03:40,653
The Doc was lying to us.

963
01:03:40,653 --> 01:03:43,523
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

964
01:03:43,523 --> 01:03:45,925
What are we going to do?

965
01:03:45,925 --> 01:03:47,860
- Morton, what is going on around here?

966
01:03:48,861 --> 01:03:51,831
- I don't know, but I got
a really horrible feeling.

967
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:53,233
We'd better find Rita quick.

968
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:56,269
- Don't fight it, Rita.

969
01:03:59,872 --> 01:04:03,409
I promise I'm going to be
the world's greatest husband.

970
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:08,381
- Oh god, I want the world's
greatest divorce lawyer.

971
01:04:08,915 --> 01:04:09,749
- Curses!

972
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:13,353
- This is for my buddy, you bitch!

973
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:16,256
(energy crackling)

974
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:24,163
- Your lights, hit it with your lights!

975
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:29,502
Don't let it get away.

976
01:04:30,937 --> 01:04:34,274
- Wait, you're going to ruin everything!

977
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:39,612
(energy crackling)

978
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:56,262
- Bet you're wishing
for some Ray-Bans now.

979
01:04:56,262 --> 01:04:57,764
- That's right.

980
01:04:57,764 --> 01:04:59,165
You're gonna die.

981
01:04:59,165 --> 01:05:00,867
There's no escape.

982
01:05:00,867 --> 01:05:01,934
You only have one other choice

983
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:04,070
and that's to go back
to your own dimension.

984
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,205
Go back and stay back!

985
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:09,108
(energy crackling)

986
01:05:14,347 --> 01:05:15,181
- Wait!

987
01:05:16,115 --> 01:05:17,016
Take me with you.

988
01:05:18,184 --> 01:05:20,920
(dramatic music)

989
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:29,529
(energy crackling)

990
01:05:52,218 --> 01:05:54,654
- What happened to Jordan?

991
01:05:54,654 --> 01:05:57,457
- I guess he's boldly gone
where no man has gone before.

992
01:05:58,558 --> 01:06:00,059
- Do you think that he's okay?

993
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:02,295
- If he's into giant eyeballs,

994
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:04,063
I'd say he'll make out like a bandit.

995
01:06:05,398 --> 01:06:06,666
- At least it's all over.

996
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,205
(ominous music)

997
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:15,375
(growling)

998
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:24,717
(energy crackling)

999
01:06:26,786 --> 01:06:29,455
(ominous music)

1000
01:12:19,205 --> 01:12:21,607
(calm music)
