Mom came home early
and busted us.

180
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,896
And after she sent Bill home,
she came up to my room

181
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:13,034
with this really serious
look on her face.

182
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:15,758
I was pretty scared.

183
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,206
And she said, "David...

184
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:21,000
I always knew you were gonna
be the loser in this family.

185
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,172
I don't think she meant it.

186
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,413
Oh yeah, she did.

187
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,793
[clattering]

188
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:27,724
And that wasn't the last time

189
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:30,655
I heard that from her either.

190
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:31,724
And after that,
and I don't know,

191
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:33,551
I just started getting
in trouble a lot.

192
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,172
Nothing seemed to
matter anymore.

193
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:38,551
But hey, getting
outta that house

194
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,586
was the best thing I ever did.

195
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,482
Now that I got a
job and everything,

196
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:44,655
I'm gonna get my own place.

197
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:46,275
That's what you
said last time.

198
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:48,034
This time I'm serious.

199
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:49,137
Besides, Stuart said

200
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:50,137
I can only stay in
the back of the shop

201
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,827
till the end of the month.

202
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,965
Guess I'm running out
of friends to hit up.

203
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:59,896
Or you can always
come back home.

204
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:01,344
Yeah. Right
that'll be the day.

205
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:04,482
Yeah. I guess this is
not a very good idea.

206
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,689
Real bad idea.

207
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:09,793
[sighs]

208
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,827
[door closes]

209
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:17,655
-[Michelle] Where have you been?
-Out

210
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:19,758
Out where? You're grounded?

211
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,241
You saw David, didn't you?

212
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,379
Ah-- He's my brother, I'm
allowed to see him, aren't I?

213
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,896
How are you planning
to get into college

214
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,310
without finishing
high school first?

215
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:28,689
I plan on finishing
high school.

216
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,172
Not with F's and
all your classes.

217
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:30,896
I'm not getting F's
in all my classes.

218
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,068
Don't lie to me!

219
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:33,931
What the hell has
gotten into you?

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,206
Do you wanna end up
like your brother?

221
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,689
Do you wanna throw
your life away?

222
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:38,000
He hasn't thrown
his life away.

223
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:39,448
He's got a good job now.

224
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,413
Right, washing dishes?

225
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:42,586
You're such a snob.

226
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,137
Listen to me.
Is that what you want?

227
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,931
Because that is exactly
how you're gonna end up

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,206
if you don't get into
a decent college.

229
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,586
Maybe I won't go
to college next fall.

230
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,517
Maybe I won't go
to college at all.

231
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:51,689
[Michelle sighs]

232
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:53,241
You don't even know
what you're saying.

233
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,241
Go to bed.

234
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,000
We'll talk about
this in the morning.

235
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,068
[sighs hard]

236
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:02,862
[Counselor] Has she been moody,
secretive, depressed lately,

237
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:04,862
hanging out with
different friends?

238
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,172
Yes. All of those things.

239
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:08,758
Just to say, we're
very concerned.

240
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:12,275
Well, I know that we
discussed this option

241
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:13,344
when you were having
problems with David

242
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:14,862
and I understood
your reluctance then

243
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:16,862
but a residential
treatment facility,

244
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:20,068
such as Meadowbrook has
been having terrific success

245
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,241
in dealing with these types
of behavior disorders.

246
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,758
You might want to reconsider

247
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:26,827
getting some professional
help this time.

248
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,655
I have to tell you, I feel
very uncomfortable about this.

249
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:30,896
I still like to
think that we could

250
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,793
handle any problems ourselves.

251
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:36,206
I understand, but I do
have to be honest with you.

252
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:39,862
I've seen these types of
sudden behavior changes in kids

253
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,896
and oftentimes it's
a cry for help.

254
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,103
If that cry goes unheard,

255
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:47,413
it could lead to self
destructive behavior.

256
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:50,379
Nowadays with teen suicides
at epidemic proportions,

257
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,827
I just think we all
have to look closer

258
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,620
at these types of warning signs.

259
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,241
[dramatic music]

260
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:30,448
Robert come up here now!

261
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,310
Where'd you find those?

262
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,655
In her desk.

263
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,724
Well what were you
doing in her desk?

264
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,827
Looking for something,
drugs, anything answers.

265
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,137
-Well it's only a poem...
-[Michelle] Read it.

266
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,482
[reading] Feeling so small,

267
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,068
but I know it'd be
better for everyone.

268
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:04,000
If I just wasn't here at all.

269
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:07,862
Just a poem huh?

270
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:09,103
[Michelle sighs heavy]

271
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:12,448
Well, she couldn't really
be talking about suicide.

272
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:13,724
[door closes]

273
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,241
I'm going to talk to her.

274
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:26,103
[footsteps approaching]

275
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,310
Hi.

276
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,482
How was school?

277
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:29,379
Fine.

278
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,689
Can we talk for a minute?

279
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:34,862
Sure.

280
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,586
I know we've had
our problems lately

281
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:46,448
but I want you to know
that you can always come

282
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:49,068
and talk to me about anything.

283
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:51,724
No matter how bad it is.

284
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:52,827
Yeah. I know that.

285
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:01,896
I know breaking up with
Danny was tough on you

286
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:07,241
and sometimes it's good
to talk about that stuff.

287
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,689
Eh-- If you feel like talking
about it and you can.

288
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:10,931
[smiles nervously]

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,275
I would like it if you did.

290
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,103
I remember when I broke up

291
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:19,000
with this guy in high
school, Dev Warner.

292
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,758
I thought I was gonna die.

293
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,517
I'm fine. I really don't
need to talk about it.

294
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,068
Are you sure?

295
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,724
Yeah.

296
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,310
Well...

297
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,034
I just wanted
you to know that

298
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,413
I'm always here for you.

299
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,310
I'm not gonna do my homework.

300
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm grounded, remember?

301
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,655
Michelle, look at this.

302
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:00,965
What is it?

303
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:05,827
It says here that
Laura never took the SAT's?

304
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,137
What?

305
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,620
No, this is a mistake.

306
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,206
I'll call the school.

307
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,000
[Michelle sighs heavy]

308
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,379
Mom, what are you doing?

309
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,517
When were you planning
to tell us about the SATs?

310
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,000
Eh-- I was gonna tell you--

311
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,793
No.

312
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,689
no more excuses,

313
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,655
no more explanations.

314
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:48,793
I don't wanna see you now,

315
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:50,275
I don't wanna hear your voice.

316
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:56,758
Okay. I'm just gonna go--

317
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,448
I don't care
where you're going.

318
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:01,517
I don't know if I can
ever forgive you for this.

[Laura] I can't believe
how stupid I am.

324
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,724
I've never seen her like that.

325
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:49,689
Uh-huh.

326
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,517
I can't go home.

327
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,310
My roommate is not coming
home until Thursday

328
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,517
so you can stay here.

329
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:57,931
It's late.

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,068
Let's go to bed.

331
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:04,448
Well, why don't I
sleep on the couch.

332
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:06,482
What's wrong?

[chuckles]

334
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:09,965
I just told you
that I can't go home.

Uh-huh.

336
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:14,413
And my life is
totally messed up.

337
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:15,896
Look, I just need
a friend right now.

338
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,620
Hey, I am your friend.

339
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:20,931
I'm the best friend
that you've got.

340
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:24,931
Look, I said no,
just leave me alone.

341
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,448
This is the
perfect opportunity.

342
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,137
We got the whole
place to ourselves.

343
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:29,896
I can't believe that's
all you're interested in.

[sighs heavy]

345
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:32,793
You never cared about me.

346
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,689
Oh don't be so selfish.

347
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:35,896
What I'm doing here.

348
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,000

00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,413
Dad, I told you I'm fine.

359
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:46,620
Yeah, the officer said

360
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:49,103
that your blood alcohol
level was very high.

361
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,413
You probably know that
we've made a decision.

362
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:52,793
We're gonna get you some help.

363
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:54,793
We're sending you to a
place called Meadowbrook.

364
00:18:54,862 --> 00:19:01,413
[dramatic music]

365
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,068
[Dr. Winslow] Self esteem,

366
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:21,275
life management
skills, leadership qualities.

367
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,655
These are the goals
of Meadowbrook.

368
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:27,482
Now we don't know yet,
the extent of Laura's problem.

369
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:32,034
The behavior you have seen
may be the tip of the iceberg,

370
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,275
or it may just be growing pains.

371
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:37,620
But I assure you, our success
rate here is impressive.

372
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,689
Often the two week evaluation
period is more than enough

373
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,068
to take care of the problem.

374
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,896
At Meadowbrook we really
do turn lives around.

375
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:45,896
[knocks]

376
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,034
[Dr. Winslow] Yes.

377
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,620
Thank you.

378
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:58,965
Very good.

379
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:02,172
Your insurance is
more than adequate.

380
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:04,517
[sighs heavily]

381
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,655
[Robert]
I love you, sweetheart.

382
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:08,793
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

383
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,965
I hope you understand we want
what's best for you sweetie.

384
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,620
Don't even try mom.

385
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,310
[steps walking away]

386
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:23,413
[sad music]

387
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:37,655
[sighs heavily]

388
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:40,586
They admitted here
without even talking to her.

389
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:41,931
What?

390
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,172
They admitted her without
seeing her, without a diagnosis.

391
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,931
How could they do that?

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,517
Well, what did they say to
the insurance companies?

393
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:49,586
It will be all right?

394
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,241
It's just two weeks.

395
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,793
The important thing is
she's getting help.

396
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:12,034
Dr Winslow, I don't know
what my parents told you,

397
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,137
but I really don't belong here.

398
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:18,965
You know Laura, I think it best
that the time that you are here

399
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:21,241
that you try to
make the most of it.

400
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,000
Consider it a break
for you and your parents.

401
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:26,275
Time to sort things out.

402
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:27,896
-Okay.
-[Dr. Winslow] Okay.

403
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:31,206
This is Ms. Collins.
She'll help you settle in.

404
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:32,379
-All right?
-Okay.

405
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:33,931
All right.

406
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,413
[door-lock opens]

407
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:47,034
[door closes loudly]

408
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,275
[Nurse] Sit here.

409
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:14,448
What's that for?

410
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:16,586
It's procedure,
everybody gets it.

411
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:19,034
[Ms. Collins]
It's just something
to relax you.

412
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:20,586
What are you doing
with my clothes?

413
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:21,586
They're inappropriate.

414
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:22,758
We have a dress code here.

415
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,172
No dresses and skirts,

416
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:26,758
nothing provocative, no shorts,
no makeup, no jewelry.

417
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:28,068
Only long pants and shirts

418
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:29,793
with the appropriate
sleeve lengths are allowed.

419
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,000
Now, why don't you get undressed

420
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:32,827
and we'll finish
getting you settled in.

421
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,000
What do you mean
get undressed?

422
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:38,172
I mean, take your clothes off.

423
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:40,000
Excuse me?

424
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,275
Strip search, it's routine.

425
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,827
Nothing to worry about, honest.

426
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,310
Here. Put this off.

427
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,965
We have five status levels
here at Meadowbrook.

428
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,862
With each level you
get more privileges.

429
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,206
You're at level one.

430
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,344
Earn a hundred points and
you move to the next level.

431
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:59,448
You just earned 10 points
for cooperating back there.

432
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:01,068
See how easy it is?

433
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:02,551
If you behave, you
get privileges.

434
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,310
Phone calls privileges,
maybe even off grounds.

435
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:06,793
Talking with other patients

436
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:08,793
will be confined with social
hour, from three to four daily.

437
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:09,896
That's all.

438
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:11,275
While you're here,
there'll be no TV,

439
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:13,827
no radio, no mail, no visitors.

440
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:17,689
I think we better
get a grip on napping

441
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:19,172
in the middle of the day.

442
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:22,137
Thank You, Ms. Collins.
I will modify my behavior.

443
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:23,689
Your dresser.

444
00:23:23,758 --> 00:23:25,344
Your bed.

445
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,551
Now, if you follow the rules,

446
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,827
you and I will get
along just fine, okay?

447
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,241
Group in 15 minutes.

448
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:36,379
Hey.

449
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:43,758
Look, I can't
talk to you. Okay?

450
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:44,793
Why not?

451
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,379
Cause I don't wanna
lose any points.

452
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:49,551
I'm almost on level four
then I get my own room.

453
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,000
Fine, we don't have to talk.

454
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,758
Did you get
anything past them?

455
00:23:56,827 --> 00:23:57,896
Like what?

456
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:00,172
You know, cigarettes,
pot, anything ?

457
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,275
[chuckles]

458
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,034
You mean if I
wanted to believe me,

459
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,034
they looked everywhere.

460
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:09,103
There's ways around
that you'll see.

461
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:12,620
[chuckles]

462
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:16,000
At least you gotta little
buzz going there, right?

463
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,965
Yeah. I feel like I've
been run over by a truck.

464
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:21,827
You're doing the
"thighs-in shuffle", that's all.

465
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:24,103
Just enough to mellow you out.

466
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:27,517
If you didn't have a
drug problem coming in,

467
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,689
don't worry you are going out.

468
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:36,103
[CJ] And we had totally
different taste in music

469
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:39,344
which was like this big
issue with my old man.

470
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:42,310
I mean, he thought I was
worshiping devil or something.

471
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,344
He was into all this...

472
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:46,551
folk music, peace and love crap.

473
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,275
With all of his friends
that wore sandals

474
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:51,482
and sit far out all the time.

475
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:53,689
I just couldn't take it anymore.

476
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,241
So one day I took all
of his records out

477
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,758
and busted them up with
a hammer in the garage.

478
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:04,379
And how did that
make you feel?

479
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:07,310
Felt great.

480
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:08,448
[chuckles]

481
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,448
[Marty] Oh.

482
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:17,241
[Counselor] Yes Marty. You have
something you'd like to share?

483
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,344
Well, I have a
complaint to register.

484
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:23,103
Fine. What is it?

485
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:24,310
Well, you know that
that blue water stuff

486
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:25,620
they have in the toilets here?

487
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:27,620
The commercial says it's
supposed to last 2000 flushes.

488
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:29,206
Right? Well, I've been counting.

489
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:32,034
With one night it can
only last 879 flushes.

490
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:35,137
That's a difference
of like 1,121 flushes.

491
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:36,793
That's false advertising.

492
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:38,068
I mean, I say there
ought to be a law---

493
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,793
[Counselor] Thank you Marty.

494
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:41,206
Keep it up.

495
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,931
You're gonna be at level two
for the rest of your life.

496
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:48,379
Does anyone else have
words of wisdom to offer?

497
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,344
All right, we have a
new member of our group

498
00:25:53,413 --> 00:25:54,517
joining us today.

499
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,724
Stand up.

500
00:25:56,793 --> 00:26:00,000
You can introduce yourself to
everyone by stating your name

501
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:02,896
and admitting that
you're an alcoholic.

502
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,965
Alcoholic, what are
you talking about?

503
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,827
You got into a run-in with
the police the other night.

504
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,068
Crashed your car,

505
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,758
it says right here that
you'd been drinking.

506
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:13,275
That's a mistake.

507
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:14,827
[chuckles]
I don't have a drinking problem.

508
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:17,172
I don't even like
the taste of alcohol.

509
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,586
Group?

510
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:21,310
Denial.

511
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,689
Denial

512
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:24,965
Denial.

513
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,137
Denial.

514
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:28,551
[CJ]
You either face up or shut up.

515
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,413
Those are the only two
choices you've got.

516
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:32,137
[Counselor] CJ's right.

517
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,103
The sooner you admit
that you have a problem,

518
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:35,896
the sooner we can get
at some of the feelings

519
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:36,724
that are at the source.

520
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:38,275
Eh-- I'm not gonna stand here

521
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:41,172
and say that I'm an
alcoholic when I'm not.

522
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:43,896
Fine, your choice.

523
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:46,310
Maybe you'd like to take a
couple of hours and time out,

524
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,000
to think about it.

525
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:50,172
You had 20 points toward
a level two Laura.

526
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,931
This is going to cost you 10.

527
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,068
-Wait--
-[Nurse] Come on, let's go.

528
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:54,482
No, this is all a big mistake.

529
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:57,827
Hey, just don't go
away mad, just go away.

530
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:00,206
I-- I don't even belong here.

531
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,655
[Laura] Get your hands off me.

532
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:04,310
[CJ] If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that one.

533
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:15,758
[Marty] You okay?

534
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:17,931
They are just trying to put
crap on your head, that's all.

535
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,103
They will let you out by dinner.

536
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:35,103
[chattering]

537
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:39,689
[Marty] Same Meadowbrook.

538
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,482
The food is bad
but there's plenty of it.

539
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:47,000
[Marty] That's just Naomi.
She's weird.

540
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,758
Yeah, I can see that.

541
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,000
[Marty]
It's her nightly routine.

542
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,275
What's wrong with her?

543
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:53,413
[Marty] I don't know.

544
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:55,000
She snapped.

545
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:57,172
Stopped talking
a couple of weeks ago.

546
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,103
They got all upset
about it after meds.

547
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,896
They can't handle it
when you act nuts.

548
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:04,206
They think she's faking
it to get attention.

549
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:05,172
[crashing]

550
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:10,965
[Nurse] Let go of her.

551
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:11,965
Leave her alone.

552
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:13,034
I said let her go!

553
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:17,620
[Nurse] You've got to modify
your behavior.

554
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:37,310
Are we getting a grip on
not giving our food away?

555
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:38,827
I told you I didn't
give my food away.

556
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:43,103
I said, are we getting a grip
on not giving our food away?

557
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:44,931
Yes. Ms. Collins.

558
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,793
I will modify my behavior?

559
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,275
I will modify my behavior.

560
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:51,758
Good.

561
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:54,172
When you've finished this one,
you can go back to your room.

562
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:07,620
[girls moaning]

563
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,172
These places are all the same.

564
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:11,275
I've been in and out
of them since I was 13.

565
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:14,241
What for?

566
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,068
The usual.

567
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,689
fought with my mom a lot.

568
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,655
I wasn't crazy or anything,

569
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,586
although I'm not
so sure anymore.

570
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:24,206
But I'm out of this place.

571
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,551
I've been working on
it for a few weeks now.

572
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,586
There's this ventilation crate
in the main room,

573
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:32,344
leads out of the building.

574
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:35,310
Every time I get a chance,
I loosen one of the screws.

575
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,689
Couple of more days
and I'm mystery.

576
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:41,413
[Nurse] Up. Face the wall.

577
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,793
What, you think you're special?

578
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:45,896
Come on, face the wall.

579
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:50,448
[Rachel]
And after that, I don't know.

580
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:53,172
I just started throwing
up after every meal

581
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:54,724
Your mom's cooking must
have been pretty bad, huh?

582
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,551
I just don't want
to get fat that's all.

583
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,206
Marty, that's not level
two behavior now is it?

584
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:04,103
Huh? Let's try to get a grip
on not making jokes in group.

585
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:07,034
I'm sorry. I'll get a
grip on not making jokes.

586
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,379
Marty.

587
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:10,344
Thank you. I'll
modify my behavior.

588
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:12,482
[Counselor]
Alright, Rachel. Thank you.

589
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,344
How about you, Laura?

590
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:19,275
Do you feel like
participating today?

591
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:23,275
Do I have to?

592
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:24,896
Well, if you wanna get
some of those points back,

593
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:26,758
you're gonna have to
start participating.

594
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,448
[CJ] Maybe she thinks
she's too good for us.

595
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:31,620
[Counselor]
Is that true, Laura?

596
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:32,724
No.

597
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:34,896
Look at her. You can tell.

598
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:36,000
I knew girls
like you in school.

599
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,689
Stuck up rich kids.

600
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:39,620
Maybe she just hasn't
got anything to say.

601
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:42,413
Give her a couple of
drinks, she'll loosen up.

602
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:43,896
Laura. Let me
ask you something.

603
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,931
Why do you think you're in here?

604
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,310
I don't know.

605
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,206
Well, I'll tell you why, because
your parents put you here.

606
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:51,862
Because you're making
their lives miserable,

607
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:54,517
because your own life
has become unmanageable.

608
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,551
You're an embarrassment to
your friends, your family,

609
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,103
everybody around you.

610
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:01,275
They may not say that to you,
but believe me, it's true.

611
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:02,724
I mean, it's bad
enough for your parents

612
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:03,586
that your brother was a loser.

613
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,482
Now you?

614
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:07,310
I don't have to
take this crap.

615
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,241
[Security] Where do you
think you're going?

616
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,620
I'm going to see Dr Winslow.

617
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,068
Nobody sees Dr. Winslow.

618
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,413
Believe me, if he
has to come in here,

619
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:14,620
you're in a lot of trouble.

620
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:16,482
You can't keep me here,
its against the law.

621
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:17,793
Not if you're under 18,

622
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:19,655
but hey, if you want
to call a lawyer.

623
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:20,931
Then take me to a phone.

624
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,793
Sorry, only level two and up
can use the phone.

625
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:32,137
[Laura yelling]
No! Let me go!

626
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:35,103
No!

627
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:37,482
Get off me.

628
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:38,758
No...

629
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:40,413
If you settle down, I
won't have to sedate you,

630
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,137
now its your choice.

631
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:43,275
Go to hell!

632
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:45,379
Get off me.
No...

633
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:48,482
[whimpering]

634
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:50,517
[faintly] No...

635
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:52,655
[whimpers fade]

636
00:31:58,068 --> 00:32:01,620
[defiant music]

637
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,827
[chatter]

638
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:36,241
[whispering]
I wanna escape with you.

639
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,034
Why would I let you do that?

640
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:41,793
Because with the two
of us loosening screws,

641
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:44,206
it'll come off faster.

642
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:45,931
All right, but you
gotta be careful.

643
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,172
They've got these security
cameras everywhere.

644
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:51,344
What the hell are
you looking at?

645
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:55,620
You gotta figure out a way

646
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:57,517
to get yourself into the main
room when nobody's there.

647
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:58,758
Best way is to get
yourself in trouble

648
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:00,379
so you get put on deep clean.

649
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:04,620
How do I get
myself in trouble?

650
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:06,586
[chuckles]

651
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:21,206
[door opens]

652
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:26,206
You better get a grip on
not sleeping in the hall.

653
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:31,931
Are you gonna answer me, huh?

654
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Or are you gonna play
your usual games?

655
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:36,965
[whimpering and laughing]

656
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:39,206
Answer me.

657
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:40,068
Hey, leave her alone.

658
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:41,517
She's not gonna hurt anybody.

659
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,517
You just got yourself
two days in deep clean.

660
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,517
[whimpering and laughing]

661
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:48,655
Are you gonna answer me?

662
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:52,413
[whimpering]

663
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,827
Get up.

664
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:58,655
-[Naomi whimpers]
-[Nurse shushing]

665
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:00,896
Come on.

666
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:02,275
[Naomi whimpers louder]

667
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,068
[Nurse] Show's over.

668
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,551
Everybody get back to your room.

669
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,448
Come on.

670
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:12,517
[Naomi whimpers]

671
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:26,724
I want you to clean
the entire floor.

672
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:42,103
[dramatic music]

673
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:24,413
[Security man] Make sure it's
done right or you doing it over.

674
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:37,034
[kung-fu screams]

675
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh man...

676
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:42,103
I love to give that cheesy weesy
a kung-fu action.

677
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,000
[chuckles]

678
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:48,758
So...

679
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:53,172
you keeping it
together alright?

680
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,413
Barely.

681
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:58,931
You'll get the hang
of it. Don't worry.

682
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:05,000
-[Laura] What'd you do?
-[Marty shushing]

683
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:11,172
What's the big deal about
talking in this place?

684
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:15,310
They don't want you
to make friends.

685
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:17,275
They want you to
rat on each other.

686
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,241
That's how you get points.

687
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,586
So that's total sex
paranoid in this place.

688
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:23,758
Like if you're
talking with someone,

689
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:25,896
they think you're having sex.

690
00:36:25,965 --> 00:36:27,896
Yeah right, that
should be so lucky.

691
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,000
[chuckles]

692
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,758
What did you do
to get deep clean?

693
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:41,896
Eh...

694
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:42,896
I don't know.

695
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,724
I found some stupid white out

696
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:46,689
in one of the four
counselors desks.

697
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:49,793
What, were you
like sniffing it?

698
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:53,413
Sniffing it?

699
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:55,517
No, I was, eh--

700
00:36:55,586 --> 00:36:58,931
I was gonna use it to paint
this little house I built.

701
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,551
What little house?

702
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,862
This house is made
up of an old meal box,

703
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,448
I stole it from the kitchen.

704
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,896
It's for Phoebe here.

705
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:16,172
[smiles]

706
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:17,206
Hey.

707
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:19,034
Hi.

708
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,862
Oh look, she's so cute.

709
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,586
I named her after Holden
Caulfield sister,

710
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,068
you know,
from catcher in the rye?

711
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:25,137
Oh.

712
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,586
You're really pretty.

713
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:32,965
You're the prettiest girl here.

714
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:38,172
It's not lying or anything.

715
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:39,413
[Laura smiles

716
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:42,862
I guess it is but I didn't
mean anything by it.

717
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,034
But I meant it not really.

718
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:46,137
Well, thanks.

719
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:58,965
[Marty]
Do you wanna be friends?

720
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:06,310
'Cause, except for Phoebe here,
I really don't have one, and...

721
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:07,724
it could be our secret.

722
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:09,689
We wouldn't have to
talk or anything.

723
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:12,275
We just know that we were there.

724
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:14,344
You know like...

725
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,137
friends do...

726
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:17,965
and like eh...

727
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:19,724
pen-pals or something,

728
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:21,827
separated by thousands of miles.

729
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:26,103
What'd you say?

730
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:28,068
Yeah. I'd like
to be your friend.

731
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:32,137
[soft music]

732
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:49,172
Wow.

733
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:50,413
Hardly recognize a meal

734
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:52,137
that doesn't come out of
a Styrofoam container.

735
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:53,689
I guess it has been a while
since we showed

736
00:38:53,758 --> 00:38:54,827
at the dinner table together.

737
00:38:57,689 --> 00:39:01,000
It's so hard for me to get
out of the office before seven,

738
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:02,206
This looks delicious.

739
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:11,206
Is it me, or does it
seem too quiet in here?

740
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:12,724
[both smile backwardly]

741
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:18,034
Maybe we should turn on some
heavy metal music upstairs

742
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:20,000
and I guess feel more at home.

743
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,482
I miss the kids.

744
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:26,344
Well... I mean.

745
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:33,793
I tried to call Laura today.

746
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:37,862
Robert, you shouldn't
have done that.

747
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:38,931
You know what they said?

748
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,068
She needs to be
separated from us.

749
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:41,620
I know, I couldn't help it.

750
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:42,896
They said she was fine

751
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,137
but they wouldn't let her
come to the phone, so--

752
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:49,000
I just hope she's really okay.

753
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,965
Don't do this to
yourself Robert.

754
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:57,103
We need to give this a chance.

755
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:59,896
We have no other choice.

756
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,000
It's only 11 more days.

757
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,586
Yeah...

758
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:07,448
But who's counting, huh?

759
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:17,000
[radio chatter]

760
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:20,896
[Laura] What happened to her?

761
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:22,137
[Rachel] Tried to up herself.

762
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:24,172
just probably cheeking her meds.

763
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,896
You know, taking the pills
back against her cheek.

764
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:30,275
When the attendant leaves,
she spits them out.

765
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,931
Then she saves them up and
takes them all at once.

766
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,275
They'll pump her stomach.

767
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:37,000
She'll be back here in two days.

768
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:45,000
[ping-pong game on]

769
00:40:50,724 --> 00:40:53,793
That guy's always
looking at me.

770
00:40:53,862 --> 00:40:55,586
[Marty] Who, CJ?

771
00:40:55,655 --> 00:40:58,344
Maybe he likes you.

772
00:40:58,413 --> 00:41:01,344
I don't think so, it's
different than that.

773
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:02,551
I wouldn't trust him.

774
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,172
As far as I could drop,
kick a range Rover.

775
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:08,206
Who is he?

776
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:11,586
Some jerk. Got
here a few weeks ago.

777
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:12,931
Spent the whole
first week in the SR

778
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,241
for mouthing off too much
and fight with the attendant.

779
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,448
Got him so strung out.

780
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,241
I don't think he knew
what planet he was on.

781
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,724
But now all of a
sudden it's yesterday.

782
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,965
"Anything you say, sir,"
Winslow's poster boy.

783
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:29,034
So what about you?

784
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:31,482
What about me?

785
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:33,068
Why are you in here?

786
00:41:49,103 --> 00:41:50,586
Why'd you do that?

787
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,310
I don't know.

788
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,310
[chuckles nervously]

789
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:00,620
Some days, I--

790
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:05,896
Well, some days I get all
wired and I feel great.

791
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:08,448
I feel like I could
jump out of an airplane

792
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:12,517
without a parachute and just
fly for days, you know?

793
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:15,103
And other days...
[laughs nervously]

794
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:22,137
They call it bipolar.

795
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,103
It's a...

796
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,275
manic depressive, you know.

797
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,793
But I'm much, much
better now really.

798
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:31,965
I mean, they make me take the
meds here and they help a lot.

799
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:33,034
So...

800
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,965
Ha... I don't think I could
ever do that to myself.

801
00:42:40,896 --> 00:42:42,241
What about you?
Why are you in here?

802
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,241
For being stupid.

803
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,344
[Rachel] Come on, let's go.

804
00:43:03,379 --> 00:43:04,931
[Laura pants]

805
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:07,724
Go, go.

806
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:15,000
[suspenseful music]

807
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:22,620
Go.

808
00:43:22,689 --> 00:43:23,758
[chair moves]

809
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:38,896
[Rachel whispering]
You go first.

810
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:40,137
[Laura] How come you are not?

811
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:41,620
-[Rachel] You.
-[Laura] Okay.

812
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:57,827
Rachel, it's a dead end.

813
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:58,965
[Rachel] There she is.

814
00:43:59,034 --> 00:44:00,896
I followed her out here.

815
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:02,862
She tried to escape.

816
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,620
[panting]

817
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,379
[Rachel] She tried to escape!

818
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,000
[Security man]
We're not gonna hurt you.

819
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:10,172
[Security woman]
Come on, stay right there.

820
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:11,827
[Security man] Calm down,
we're not gonna hurt you.

821
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:13,413
Calm down!
We won't hurt you!

822
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:14,793
[Laura] Stay back!

823
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:18,551
[Security man] Calm down!

824
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,310
You go back to your room.

825
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:24,517
[Laura panting]

826
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,241
[panting]

827
00:44:58,413 --> 00:44:59,758
[Laura] No! Wait...

828
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:01,172
[CJ shushing]
I'm on your side.

829
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,862
[Laura] What are you doing?

830
00:45:07,448 --> 00:45:08,620
[Laura panting]

831
00:45:08,689 --> 00:45:09,793
Shut up and listen.

832
00:45:09,862 --> 00:45:10,896
When you get out
to the parking lot,

833
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:11,896
head for the trees
on your right,

834
00:45:11,965 --> 00:45:13,379
don't stop till
you hit the road.

835
00:45:13,448 --> 00:45:15,758
Call a woman named Nora Fields.
You get the Teen Law Office.

836
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:16,758
Tell her what you've
seen in here. Everything.

837
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:17,793
You got that?

838
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:20,448
Yeah, yeah.
Nora Fields, right.

839
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,620
[CJ] Come on.

840
00:45:23,827 --> 00:45:25,034
[Laura] Wait, wait,
what about the doors?

841
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:26,620
Just leave that to me.

842
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:31,448
[Emergency bell rings]

843
00:45:31,517 --> 00:45:32,827
[CJ] Go, Go!

844
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:39,793
[grunts]

845
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:50,206
David, hi, its me.

846
00:45:50,275 --> 00:45:51,793
Now I know it's early.
I'm sorry.

847
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:54,137
But I need
you to come pick me up.

848
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:55,586
Eh-- It's a long story.

849
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:56,965
I'll tell you when you get here.

850
00:46:09,344 --> 00:46:10,862
You sure you wanna do this?

851
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:12,379
You can always stay
with me you know.

852
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:13,965
No, everybody's
looking for me.

853
00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:15,758
I just want it all to be over.

854
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:22,448
Hey, I'll call you later.

855
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:25,137
Bye.

856
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:27,000
Mum? Dad?

857
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,241
[Michelle] Baby.

858
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,482
You wouldn't believe
the terrible things--

859
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:32,655
[Robert] Laura?

860
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:35,517
They strapped us
in chairs and they...

861
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:38,172
put straight jackets on
us and they drugged us.

862
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:41,448
What's wrong.

863
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,896
[Dr. Winslow] She won't
participate in group sessions.

864
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:55,896
She disobeys all the rules.

865
00:46:55,965 --> 00:46:58,000
She takes no interest
in her own recovery.

866
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:01,965
I can't believe that's Laura.

867
00:47:03,758 --> 00:47:05,068
Needless to say,

868
00:47:05,137 --> 00:47:08,344
the two week evaluation
period was a bit optimistic.

869
00:47:08,413 --> 00:47:11,275
We suggest that her stay be
extended by at least a month.

870
00:47:11,344 --> 00:47:12,965
A month?

871
00:47:13,034 --> 00:47:15,448
I-- I don't know.

872
00:47:15,517 --> 00:47:18,482
Mr. Mills, your daughter's
behavior has become volatile.

873
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:19,827
She's a danger to herself.

874
00:47:19,896 --> 00:47:21,310
She's a danger to others.

875
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:24,000
She requires
24-hour supervision.

876
00:47:24,068 --> 00:47:26,068
Are you prepared to watch
her for that long?

877
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:27,862
Unless you say to me that you
know what is best

878
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:28,896
for your daughter, then I'll--

879
00:47:28,965 --> 00:47:30,482
No.

880
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:32,517
She'll be safer there.

881
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,034
How do we get her
to understand...

882
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:41,655
that she needs this help?

883
00:47:43,206 --> 00:47:44,241
Let me talk to her.

884
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:47,758
[steps walking away]

885
00:47:53,068 --> 00:47:54,758
[Laura] You're not taking
me back there.

886
00:47:56,551 --> 00:48:00,344
Laura, the way I see
it you have two choices.

887
00:48:00,413 --> 00:48:02,206
You either come
back to Meadowbrook,

888
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:05,137
without making a scene...

889
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:07,206
or I call child services

890
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:10,586
and you go straight to a
juvenile detention center.

891
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:14,000
And if you were uncomfortable
at Meadowbrook, believe me...

892
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,793
this is it, choice is yours.

893
00:48:20,586 --> 00:48:23,034
[door opens]

894
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:24,965
I don't understand why
you're doing this to me.

895
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:27,034
Everything I told you was true.

896
00:48:33,758 --> 00:48:34,931
Hey.

897
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,413
Call a woman named
Nora, the Teen Law Office,

898
00:48:36,482 --> 00:48:38,137
she'll tell you everything.

899
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:45,379
You're making
the right decision.

900
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:46,655
Yeah.

901
00:48:50,034 --> 00:48:51,172
[engine revs]

902
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:52,241
[van door closes]

903
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:00,379
[sad music]

904
00:49:08,137 --> 00:49:09,206
I'm going to work.

905
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,896
[defiant music]

906
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:35,827
Wait a second, you're
not putting me in those.

907
00:49:35,896 --> 00:49:37,896
You ran away, you're
going to be strapped.

908
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:40,068
No, let go of me!

909
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,000
No! No!

910
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:44,344
No!

911
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:47,000
You can't do this, let me out.

912
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,827
You better regulate
your moods Laura.

913
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:50,379
No! Get that away from me.

914
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:52,068
You'll feel better
in a few minutes.

915
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:57,103
[panting]

916
00:49:57,172 --> 00:49:59,000
[sighs hard]

917
00:50:21,862 --> 00:50:24,000
You all right?

918
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:26,310
I couldn't sleep.

919
00:50:26,379 --> 00:50:27,379
I feel like Judas.

920
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:32,724
Don't think like that,
we did what we had to.

921
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:36,103
What if she's
telling the truth

922
00:50:36,172 --> 00:50:38,241
about what goes on in there.

923
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,551
You really think
kids are being drugged

924
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,724
and strapped to chairs?

925
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:44,482
What if it isn't helping,
what if it's making her worse.

926
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:46,275
It has to work.

927
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:48,793
It has to. Otherwise
we have lost everything

928
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:51,034
that we've ever planned
for her, her whole future.

929
00:50:51,103 --> 00:50:52,689
All of her dreams gone.

930
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:56,517
When did we ever ask
her what her dreams were?

931
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,413
[Dr. Winslow] Laura?

932
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:06,724
Laura?

933
00:51:06,793 --> 00:51:08,655
Hello Laura.

934
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:10,241
How are we doing?

935
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,206
I'm strapped to my bed,
how do you think I'm doing?

936
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:16,413
Please, Laura, it doesn't
have to be this difficult.

937
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:18,655
You don't have to fight.

938
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:21,862
Then let me out and I won't.

939
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:23,241
It doesn't work that way.

940
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,517
You first have to acknowledge
that you have problems

941
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:27,344
and that you need our help.

942
00:51:27,413 --> 00:51:29,413
I don't need your help.

943
00:51:29,482 --> 00:51:30,620
[panting]

944
00:51:30,689 --> 00:51:31,931
Just let me out!

945
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,068
You give us no choice

946
00:51:33,137 --> 00:51:35,000
but to continue this
course of treatment

947
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:40,448
Dr. Winslow, this patient
has had over 30 milligrams

948
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,758
of Cyclizine in
the last 24 hours.

949
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:46,758
All right. Let her rest.

950
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:54,448
[grunting]

951
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:57,482
[rapid door knocks]

952
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,206
Hi.

953
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:11,068
Listen. I know I'm not
supposed to be here, but...

954
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:13,034
I just came by to see
how Laura was doing.

955
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:14,620
Alright?

956
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:16,206
She's not here.

957
00:52:16,275 --> 00:52:17,655
Oh yeah. Where'd she go?

958
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:22,034
You sent her back
there, didn't you?

959
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,689
I can't believe you, how
could you do that to her?

960
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:28,862
We were afraid she
was gonna kill herself.

961
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:30,896
We had no other choice.

962
00:52:30,965 --> 00:52:32,931
What are you babbling about?

963
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,724
Laura would never kill herself.

964
00:52:35,793 --> 00:52:37,758
What are you
doing here, David?

965
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:39,517
I told you not to set
foot in this house

966
00:52:39,586 --> 00:52:40,896
until you'd paid back--

967
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:42,034
Don't worry, you don't have
to lock up the silverware,

968
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:43,862
I'm leaving.

969
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:45,620
I just came by to see my sister.

970
00:52:47,517 --> 00:52:48,827
Leave Laura alone.

971
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:50,517
I don't want you around her.

972
00:52:50,586 --> 00:52:51,689
You've done enough.

973
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:53,344
Ooh, really?

974
00:52:53,413 --> 00:52:55,379
Hey, I hear the mom of
the year award is coming up.

975
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:58,068
Maybe Laura and
I will nominate you.

976
00:52:58,137 --> 00:52:59,689
Don't look at him.

977
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:01,241
He never gets his hands dirty.
He's the man of stone--

978
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,310
All right David.

979
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,172
[David] Aren't you pops.

980
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:05,482
You can leave now.

981
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:07,206
If you think Laura's just
going to waltz back in here

982
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:08,413
and forgive you for
what you've done,

983
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:09,793
you're both insane.

984
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:11,931
And you wonder why you're
not welcome in this house.

985
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,413
Oh you make sure to remind
me every chance you get.

986
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,068
[bangs door]

987
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:27,103
Hi.

988
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,931
Eh--

989
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,793
I was just nowhere
near your neighborhood.

990
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:37,482
And thought I stop in
for a cup of coffee.

991
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:38,551
[laughs backwardly]

992
00:53:43,689 --> 00:53:44,724
Are you okay?

993
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,206
[Marty shushing]

994
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:53,586
Come on, don't cry.

995
00:53:53,655 --> 00:53:56,241
[Marty] Hey, do you believe
in reincarnation?

996
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,448
'Cause I do.

997
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:00,275
I believe I'm gonna
come back after I die.

998
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:03,034
And I'm coming back
as rock star,

999
00:54:03,103 --> 00:54:06,482
Michael Jordan, something.

1000
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:09,310
Next time, it's gonna be better.

1001
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,724
So when it gets real bad,

1002
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:12,137
you know?
you think about that.

1003
00:54:12,206 --> 00:54:14,172
Think about next time,

1004
00:54:14,241 --> 00:54:15,551
another chance.

1005
00:54:23,068 --> 00:54:25,068
Get a grip.

1006
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,689
You belong in your own wing.

1007
00:54:26,758 --> 00:54:28,275
You know the rules.

1008
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:30,827
Thank you, Dr. Winslow.
I'll modify my behavior.

1009
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:50,931
Laura...

1010
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,310
your moods have
become unmanageable.

1011
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:57,724
You need therapeutic
intervention.

1012
00:54:57,793 --> 00:54:59,000
You can't handle
this on your own.

1013
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:01,000
You know that now, don't you?

1014
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:06,896
I think you're ready
to start cooperating.

1015
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:08,000
It's time to let go.

1016
00:55:12,172 --> 00:55:15,827
You've gotten a grip on
your anger, haven't you?

1017
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,758
[whispering] Yes.

1018
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:20,000
I'm proud of you.

1019
00:55:22,724 --> 00:55:24,965
You're gonna be just fine.

1020
00:56:12,758 --> 00:56:16,000
[chattering]

1021
00:56:20,862 --> 00:56:23,034
Hey, they let you out.

1022
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:24,413
Yeah.

1023
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:26,034
Yeah, I don't want
any more trouble.

1024
00:56:26,103 --> 00:56:29,241
I'm just gonna do my time.

1025
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,413
Tell them everything
they wanna hear.

1026
00:56:31,482 --> 00:56:33,241
Good. That's good.

1027
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,689
It's easier that way.

1028
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:38,724
Yeah. They made me a level
two for promising to cooperate.

1029
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:39,896
[Marty chuckles]

1030
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:42,379
Took me out of Cyclizine.

1031
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:45,931
So then, you'll be
okay in here without me.

1032
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:49,896
What do you mean?

1033
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:53,344
I'm getting out today?

1034
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:54,103
What happened?

1035
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:55,137
I don't know.

1036
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:56,827
They just told me
to go pack my stuff.

1037
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:57,931
[chuckles]

1038
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,137
That's great.

1039
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:00,551
Yeah. Yeah, my dad is
going to come pick me up.

1040
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,551
We're gonna go to our house
was going to be a big party.

1041
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,000
Everyone's going to be there.

1042
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:06,793
You know.
I'll give you my number.

1043
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:08,137
Now that you're in level two.

1044
00:57:08,206 --> 00:57:09,310
You call me, right?

1045
00:57:09,379 --> 00:57:11,310
Yeah, I will, I promise.

1046
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:15,896
You gonna be okay
out there, aren't you?

1047
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,724
Me? Yes, of course.

1048
00:57:18,793 --> 00:57:20,344
I told you I'm all better.

1049
00:57:21,827 --> 00:57:23,068
Really.

1050
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:25,137
Okay.

1051
00:57:25,206 --> 00:57:26,689
Don't forget
to take your meds.

1052
00:57:26,758 --> 00:57:28,862
Yes, I will. I promise.

1053
00:57:31,379 --> 00:57:32,827
I-- I'm going to miss you.

1054
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:35,896
[sighs]

1055
00:57:35,965 --> 00:57:38,655
You're the only
friend I have in here.

1056
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:41,896
We'll still be friends.

1057
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:44,000
We'll always be friends.

1058
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:03,551
[sighs]

1059
00:58:09,896 --> 00:58:11,172
-[Robert] Hi.
-[Woman] Yeah?

1060
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:13,758
-[Nora] What do you want?
-[Robert] Are you Nora Fields?

1061
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:15,275
Last time I looked.

1062
00:58:15,344 --> 00:58:17,620
I-- I talked to your
secretary earlier.

1063
00:58:17,689 --> 00:58:19,000
My name is Robert Mills.

1064
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:20,034
I got your name
from my daughter.

1065
00:58:20,103 --> 00:58:21,413
She's a...

1066
00:58:21,482 --> 00:58:22,965
patient...

1067
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:24,034
at Meadowbrook,

1068
00:58:24,103 --> 00:58:25,586
which is an adolescent
treatment center.

1069
00:58:25,655 --> 00:58:28,758
I know what it is. Sit down.

1070
00:58:28,827 --> 00:58:30,793
How'd your daughter get my name.

1071
00:58:30,862 --> 00:58:32,103
I don't know.

1072
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:34,413
But she told me that you
knew all about these places.

1073
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:35,793
Is that true?

1074
00:58:35,862 --> 00:58:37,793
I advocate for kids who
have been wrongly placed

1075
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:39,551
in institutions
like Meadowbrook,

1076
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,689
which you might
if you're like most of them.

1077
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:45,896
That's not to say there
aren't some good ones.

1078
00:58:45,965 --> 00:58:49,551
There are, but I'm here
for the ones that aren't.

1079
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,620
I'm with this little...

1080
00:58:51,689 --> 00:58:53,793
David and Goliath thing here,
you know.

1081
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:55,724
Just glad it's me
and my secretary.

1082
00:58:57,586 --> 00:59:00,241
for the whole operation,
so, I'm clearly insane.

1083
00:59:01,758 --> 00:59:02,620
Herbal... disgusting.

1084
00:59:05,344 --> 00:59:08,620
So, what can I do
for you Mr. Mills?

1085
00:59:10,206 --> 00:59:11,103
Eh--

1086
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,103
My daughter, Laura

1087
00:59:13,172 --> 00:59:15,310
tried to tell us that there are
some pretty awful things

1088
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:16,758
that go on in these places.

1089
00:59:16,827 --> 00:59:18,931
And...

1090
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,758
to be honest with you,
I don't know what to believe.

1091
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:26,103
Well, if half of what you
said was true, is that enough?

1092
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:30,551
Yeah, I guess it would be.

1093
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,172
I guess you got your answer.

1094
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:33,103
Well...

1095
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:34,206
let's hope for her sake

1096
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,586
that you got a lousy
insurance policy.

1097
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:39,103
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1098
00:59:39,172 --> 00:59:40,827
Now you see the length
of stay in these place,

1099
00:59:40,896 --> 00:59:43,758
seems to depend on how much
the insurance will cover.

1100
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:47,275
Insurance runs out, presto
change-o, Johnny's cured.

1101
00:59:47,344 --> 00:59:49,103
Well, how can they do that?
That's not right.

1102
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:50,655
[scoffs]

1103
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:52,137
Mr. Mills,

1104
00:59:52,206 --> 00:59:53,965
would you buy a car
without checking it out first?

1105
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:56,862
I mean, at least
kicking the tires.

1106
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:58,241
No, of course not.

1107
01:00:00,068 --> 01:00:03,413
I hate to tell you this,
but you just bought a lemon.

1108
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:04,655
What do you mean?

1109
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:08,931
Did they give you a
tour of Meadowbrook?

1110
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,965
[Robert shuffles on his seat]

1111
01:00:19,034 --> 01:00:22,517
All right Mr. Mills, I'm
gonna tell you a little bit

1112
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,620
about these private
treatment facilities.

1113
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:52,275
[sad music]

1114
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:00,827
[smile]

1115
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:05,482
[sobbing]

1116
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:09,517
[sighs]

1117
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,724
[CJ] Hey, they don't like
you to stay in here

1118
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:25,275
after the social hour.

1119
01:01:26,758 --> 01:01:29,827
Thanks.

1120
01:01:29,896 --> 01:01:32,379
So, did you get in
trouble after the fire alarm?

1121
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:35,379
That? No, a couple of
days in SR, no big deal.

1122
01:01:37,965 --> 01:01:39,241
Sorry.

1123
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,896
Forget it. You would've done
the same for me, right?

1124
01:01:44,379 --> 01:01:45,931
Listen, you have to stop
getting the injections

1125
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,758
once they got you hooked
on the big T you're theirs.

1126
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:50,482
I'm not getting
injections anymore.

1127
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:52,310
They're just giving
me a couple pills.

1128
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:55,344
Good. You have to
start cheeking them.

1129
01:01:55,413 --> 01:01:58,517
Why do you care
what happens to me?

1130
01:01:58,586 --> 01:02:00,103
I just do that sometimes.

1131
01:02:01,965 --> 01:02:03,137
Come on.

1132
01:02:17,103 --> 01:02:19,413
I went to see someone today,

1133
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:22,000
a woman from the
Teen Law Office.

1134
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:27,034
I think Laura was
telling the truth

1135
01:02:27,103 --> 01:02:29,965
about the things that
go on in that place.

1136
01:02:30,034 --> 01:02:32,482
Why are you doing this?

1137
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:35,068
She needs to be there to
be watched 24 hours a day.

1138
01:02:35,137 --> 01:02:37,655
These places like
Meadowbrook are dumping grounds

1139
01:02:37,724 --> 01:02:39,758
for parents looking
for easy answers.

1140
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:41,034
Easy answers?

1141
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:42,482
There's a lot of kids that
don't even belong there.

1142
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:45,862
Th-- This woman, she was telling
me that these hospitals,

1143
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:48,068
they overcharge and
double building insurance

1144
01:02:48,137 --> 01:02:49,275
until they bleed them dry.

1145
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:51,103
And then they stamp
cured on the kid's file

1146
01:02:51,172 --> 01:02:52,172
and turn them loose.

1147
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:53,103
That's not happening
at Meadowbrook.

1148
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:54,310
We were there.

1149
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:55,827
Honey, I think we gotta
get her out of there

1150
01:02:55,896 --> 01:02:58,103
and into some kind
of family counseling.

1151
01:02:58,172 --> 01:02:59,620
[Michelle sighs heavily]

1152
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:01,448
You always do this to me.

1153
01:03:01,517 --> 01:03:03,827
We take a stand together
and then you fold

1154
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:05,896
and I'm left picking
up the pieces.

1155
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:06,931
If it weren't for me,

1156
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,172
nothing would get
done in this family.

1157
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:10,172
Hey, I work my off every day.

1158
01:03:10,241 --> 01:03:11,655
-[Michelle] And I don't?
-[Robert] I didn't say that.

1159
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:13,034
You know, if you had been there,

1160
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:14,896
if you had been available
for your children,

1161
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:17,551
if you would've been willing
to take a stand just once,

1162
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,482
we wouldn't be in this mess.

1163
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,655
I have a responsibility
to my child.

1164
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:23,172
She needs me to
be strong for her

1165
01:03:23,241 --> 01:03:24,827
and I'm going to be strong.

1166
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:25,724
Where are you going?

1167
01:03:25,793 --> 01:03:26,896
Out.

1168
01:03:59,137 --> 01:04:00,724
[door knocks]

1169
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,551
-[Robert]
-Hi.

1170
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,551
I was wondering
if we could talk.

1171
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:28,793
Yeah. It's late.

1172
01:04:28,862 --> 01:04:32,103
I know. I thought maybe
we could get a beer.

1173
01:04:36,724 --> 01:04:38,137
Sure.

1174
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:39,448
As long as
it's non-alcoholic.

1175
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:59,034
I heard Stewart's
dad gave you a job.

1176
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,896
Yeah, they got a big
contract with the city.

1177
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:04,206
Need an extra hand.

1178
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,379
It's nothing much,

1179
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:06,827
it's just got me doing
some groundwork for now.

1180
01:05:06,896 --> 01:05:09,034
Mostly sub-metering, three-phase
wiring, stuff like that.

1181
01:05:09,103 --> 01:05:10,827
Oh, that's great.

1182
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:17,379
Look...

1183
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:19,241
I know you didn't bring me
here to talk about my job.

1184
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:24,724
I know you brought
Laura home the other day.

1185
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:26,758
But David, I need to know
did she say anything

1186
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:28,517
about what goes
on in that place?

1187
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:33,034
Yeah, she did.

1188
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:34,620
Sound like a concentration
camp in there.

1189
01:05:34,689 --> 01:05:36,448
And you believe her?

1190
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:37,586
She wouldn't lie to me.

1191
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:40,965
[sighs hard]

1192
01:05:41,034 --> 01:05:42,758
We really trying to do
what we thought was best.

1193
01:05:42,827 --> 01:05:45,310
She thought it was best?

1194
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:46,689
Wait til she gets
out of that place.

1195
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:47,896
And she has to go back to school

1196
01:05:47,965 --> 01:05:51,310
where everyone knows
she was in a nuthouse.

1197
01:05:51,379 --> 01:05:52,413
It's getting late....

1198
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:53,413
No. Wait, wait, Please.

1199
01:06:00,241 --> 01:06:03,620
Look, I didn't kind of
just talk about Laura. I--

1200
01:06:03,689 --> 01:06:05,620
I came because I
needed to talk to you.

1201
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:11,379
Look, David. I know how
hard this has been for you.

1202
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:14,482
It hasn't been
any easier for me.

1203
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:16,586
Your mother and I, we
haven't said two civil words

1204
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:17,724
to each other since you left.

1205
01:06:17,793 --> 01:06:18,896
So it's my fault then?

1206
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:20,896
No, no, no.

1207
01:06:20,965 --> 01:06:24,034
I have no one to
blame, but myself,

1208
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:27,137
I know I haven't been
the perfect husband

1209
01:06:27,206 --> 01:06:28,068
or the perfect father.

1210
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,517
But I'd still like to
think that you and I could...

1211
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:38,827
[chuckles]

1212
01:06:38,896 --> 01:06:40,482
It's a little late for
you to try and be my dad.

1213
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:42,931
Don't you think?

1214
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,068
I mean, it's not like
we're going to go

1215
01:06:44,137 --> 01:06:45,724
in the backyard and chuck
the old football around.

1216
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,517
Yeah, you're right.

1217
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:04,724
But I'm still your father

1218
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:06,344
and I love you.

1219
01:07:06,413 --> 01:07:07,758
[sighs]

1220
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:09,551
Look, do you want me to
let you off the hook?

1221
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,379
Fine. You're off the hook.

1222
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,068
I screwed up, I know that.

1223
01:07:13,137 --> 01:07:15,758
Living with me was no picnic
either,

1224
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,413
but I'm okay now.

1225
01:07:17,482 --> 01:07:18,586
I'm not carrying any grudges.

1226
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,103
Things just turned out
the way they turned out.

1227
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:22,620
You know, end of story.

1228
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:25,310
So you can just stop feeling
sorry for yourself, okay?

1229
01:07:29,689 --> 01:07:31,172
Thanks for the soda.

1230
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:56,275
Hey, come on.

1231
01:07:56,344 --> 01:07:57,827
Let's go back to your room.

1232
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:02,103
[Laura] Come on.

1233
01:08:02,172 --> 01:08:04,000
everything's gonna be okay.

1234
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:10,310
You all right?

1235
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:13,379
Come on,
let's just lie down.

1236
01:08:13,448 --> 01:08:15,000
Come on.

1237
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:22,137
[door creaking]

1238
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,000
What are you doing here?

1239
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,275
Maybe I should ask
you the same thing.

1240
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:30,758
Listen, don't let
no one come in please.

1241
01:08:30,827 --> 01:08:33,862
Fine, tell me what
you're doing in there.

1242
01:08:33,931 --> 01:08:35,551
Why don't we just
go back to our rooms

1243
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,689
and forget about
everything, okay?

1244
01:08:37,758 --> 01:08:40,413
Come on. The attendee
comes by 40 seconds.

1245
01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:41,517
Fine.

1246
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:45,344
Thanks.

1247
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:46,482
Now we're even.

1248
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:04,172
Open.

1249
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:05,310
Tongue?

1250
01:09:07,137 --> 01:09:08,620
I'm proud of the way
you've been taking

1251
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:10,275
your medication lately.

1252
01:09:10,344 --> 01:09:13,034
You've just earned
yourself another 10 points.

1253
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:25,586
[Counselor] It's nice to have
you joining us again Laura.

1254
01:09:25,655 --> 01:09:28,551
I don't suppose you're ready
to start participating.

1255
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,862
My name's Laura

1256
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:38,862
and I'm an alcoholic.

1257
01:09:38,931 --> 01:09:40,482
No, listen.

1258
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,551
I've told you a hundred
times, I cannot do it anymore.

1259
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,172
That's it.

1260
01:09:46,827 --> 01:09:49,310
I know, I know, I
know, I'm sorry.

1261
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:51,758
Look, it's my fault.

1262
01:09:51,827 --> 01:09:54,827
I guess I have to
get it together.

1263
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:56,344
I have a family.

1264
01:09:56,413 --> 01:09:58,862
I gotta start being
there for my kids.

1265
01:09:58,931 --> 01:10:00,793
You know?

1266
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:02,827
No, I'm sorry.

1267
01:10:02,896 --> 01:10:04,172
It's over.

1268
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,275
That's it.

1269
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:12,724
Oh.

1270
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:15,103
Mr. Mills.

1271
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:16,655
What can I do for you?

1272
01:10:16,724 --> 01:10:19,620
Well, I've come to get Laura.

1273
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:20,724
Yes. Is there a problem?

1274
01:10:20,793 --> 01:10:22,103
No, no, no, no.
There is no problem.

1275
01:10:22,172 --> 01:10:23,310
We just want her at home.

1276
01:10:23,379 --> 01:10:25,137
We, is your wife here?

1277
01:10:25,206 --> 01:10:26,310
No, she couldn't come.

1278
01:10:26,379 --> 01:10:29,137
I see, have a seat.

1279
01:10:29,206 --> 01:10:30,275
[Robert clears throat]
No, that's all right.

1280
01:10:30,344 --> 01:10:32,689
I think I'll stand.

1281
01:10:32,758 --> 01:10:34,724
Mr. Mills, it is not advisable

1282
01:10:34,793 --> 01:10:35,965
for you to take
Laura out of here

1283
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:37,620
before her treatment
is complete.

1284
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:39,103
Just show me where to sign.

1285
01:10:39,172 --> 01:10:41,103
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

1286
01:10:41,172 --> 01:10:43,310
We have been authorized
by you, her legal guardian

1287
01:10:43,379 --> 01:10:46,758
and your insurance company
to perform a service.

1288
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:50,241
We have diagnosed her as
being severely depressed.

1289
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:54,448
That's enough to mandate a
stay here for up to six months.

1290
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:56,620
Six months?

1291
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:58,241
What are you talking about?

1292
01:11:00,586 --> 01:11:04,206
Let me try to explain
this as simply as I can.

1293
01:11:04,275 --> 01:11:07,517
If you take Laura out of
here against medical advice

1294
01:11:07,586 --> 01:11:10,965
and she harms herself, you
could be liable for negligence.

1295
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:13,000
You could lose custody
of your daughter.

1296
01:11:14,655 --> 01:11:16,103
Look, I-- I'll take my chance.

1297
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:18,000
Please go get my daughter.

1298
01:11:22,241 --> 01:11:23,793
I don't know what to tell you.

1299
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,275
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Mills.

1300
01:11:26,344 --> 01:11:28,068
I'm afraid I can't
let you take her

1301
01:11:28,137 --> 01:11:29,379
without your wife's consent.

1302
01:11:29,448 --> 01:11:31,000
Wh-- What are you talking about?

1303
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:35,379
There were two signatures
here on the admissions form.

1304
01:11:35,448 --> 01:11:38,517
Under state law, you
to have joint custody.

1305
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,034
We'll need her signature.

1306
01:11:40,103 --> 01:11:41,620
That's the law.

1307
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:43,103
My hands are tied.

1308
01:11:44,655 --> 01:11:45,689
[sighs]

1309
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,896
Phone privilege allows
you three calls per week.

1310
01:11:49,965 --> 01:11:52,655
All calls must be kept
to under five minutes,

1311
01:11:52,724 --> 01:11:54,482
your conversation
will be monitored.

1312
01:12:03,172 --> 01:12:04,310
[David's answering machine]
Hi, this is Dave

1313
01:12:04,379 --> 01:12:06,241
and I'm not here to take
your call, so please...

1314
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:07,241
I got the machine.

1315
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,068
Can I make another call?

1316
01:12:09,137 --> 01:12:10,137
Okay.

1317
01:12:18,827 --> 01:12:19,758
[Woman] Hello?

1318
01:12:19,827 --> 01:12:21,068
Hi is Marty there?

1319
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,586
[Woman] Who is this?

1320
01:12:23,655 --> 01:12:25,586
I'm a friend of
his from Meadowbrook.

1321
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:27,655
Can I speak to him?

1322
01:12:29,655 --> 01:12:30,793
Hello?

1323
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,413
What?

1324
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:40,931
[sad music]

1325
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:54,275
[chattering]

1326
01:12:57,103 --> 01:12:59,310
Marty's dead.

1327
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:00,862
He killed himself.

1328
01:13:02,965 --> 01:13:04,931
Huh-- yeah.

1329
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:11,241
He told me that his father
was gonna pick him up.

1330
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:15,068
Whole family was gonna
have a big party for him.

1331
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:16,517
Marty didn't have a dad.

1332
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,034
He lived alone with his
grandmother at the trailer park.

1333
01:13:23,586 --> 01:13:26,758
[sobbing]

1334
01:13:26,827 --> 01:13:29,068
He told me that everything
was gonna be okay.

1335
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:33,862
He wasn't ready to go.

1336
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:36,620
Listen, whatever
problems he had,

1337
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:39,379
they only got worse in here.

1338
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:42,137
As far as they're concerned,
the only thing he suffered from

1339
01:13:42,206 --> 01:13:44,620
was insurance
deficiency syndrome.

1340
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:50,241
They shouldn't
have let him out.

1341
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,586
It happens all
the time.

1342
01:13:53,655 --> 01:13:54,965
I'm sorry.

1343
01:14:00,517 --> 01:14:01,551
[crying]

1344
01:14:07,137 --> 01:14:09,517
Michelle. We have
to go get Laura.

1345
01:14:09,586 --> 01:14:12,551
They won't release her
without your signature.

1346
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,931
I'm busy right now.

1347
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,379
We can just come
back some other time.

1348
01:14:15,448 --> 01:14:17,517
It's all right, he's leaving.

1349
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:21,241
I have people here,
this is my work.

1350
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,655
What is more important?

1351
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,689
You work or our daughter?

1352
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:27,137
Will you excuse me.

1353
01:14:27,206 --> 01:14:28,482
Michelle.

1354
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:30,551
This is not the time to
talk about Laura's problems.

1355
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:32,517
Well maybe the problem
isn't with Laura.

1356
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:35,482
Oh, it's me, huh? I'm
too demanding a profe--

1357
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:36,793
Maybe you are. Maybe--

1358
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:38,068
I work too much
for my children.

1359
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:39,724
Somebody has to want
something from them.

1360
01:14:39,793 --> 01:14:41,103
What do you think I'm doing.

1361
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:42,551
I raised those kids.

1362
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,379
I made their life
out of nothing,
where the hell were you?

1363
01:14:44,448 --> 01:14:45,551
Fine, why don't you
admit you're married a man

1364
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,137
who couldn't live up
to your expectations.

1365
01:14:48,206 --> 01:14:50,241
I guess your girlfriends
probably have lower
expectations,

1366
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:53,000
Right? But I deserve a better.

1367
01:14:55,448 --> 01:14:57,517
We're just gonna
leave our card.

1368
01:14:57,586 --> 01:15:00,620
No, I'm sorry.

1369
01:15:00,689 --> 01:15:02,965
[Michelle] Please. I-- I--

1370
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:06,034
[sighs]

1371
01:15:08,827 --> 01:15:11,137
Man, Look, the attendant
is going to be by in a minute,

1372
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,241
Just go back to your room.

1373
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,379
No, I wanna go on with you.

1374
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:15,965
Unless you want me to
go get the attendant.

1375
01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:19,896
We can both explain to him
why we're standing out here.

1376
01:15:19,965 --> 01:15:21,206
[sighs heavily]

1377
01:15:27,379 --> 01:15:29,965
Help me with this.

1378
01:15:30,034 --> 01:15:33,724
[door creaks]

1379
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:34,965
Here, don't lose it.

1380
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:36,413
It's the key to this room.

1381
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:42,620
Alright, come on.

1382
01:15:42,689 --> 01:15:45,206
[CJ] We're gonna look to all
these files over here.

1383
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:47,206
When you start to take out
those files right up there.

1384
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:48,517
What are we looking for?

1385
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:52,586
Anything with a dollar
amount, the billing records,

1386
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:54,655
stuff like this here.

1387
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:55,793
See this amount here?

1388
01:15:55,862 --> 01:15:58,620
$860 is their actual
cost of medication

1389
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:01,896
for one patient from the
weeks 8-6 six to 8-19.

1390
01:16:01,965 --> 01:16:04,517
This is what they billed
the insurance company.

1391
01:16:04,586 --> 01:16:06,000
$20,600?

1392
01:16:06,068 --> 01:16:07,931
Insurance fraud.

1393
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,137
Grab those files right there.

1394
01:16:10,206 --> 01:16:11,482
Why aren't you trying
to bust them

1395
01:16:11,551 --> 01:16:13,310
for all the other stuff
that goes on in here?

1396
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:14,620
The way they torture kids.

1397
01:16:14,689 --> 01:16:16,620
Those complaints have to
be filed as malpractice suits

1398
01:16:16,689 --> 01:16:18,000
and you're impossible to win.

1399
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:20,517
The way to beat them is
to expose the fraud.

1400
01:16:20,586 --> 01:16:22,137
When the insurance
company stopped paying,

1401
01:16:22,206 --> 01:16:24,793
this place goes out of business.

1402
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:25,896
This is crazy.

1403
01:16:33,482 --> 01:16:37,068
[suspenseful music]

1404
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:54,310
Who are they?

1405
01:16:54,379 --> 01:16:55,896
These are names of
people I collected

1406
01:16:55,965 --> 01:16:57,344
taking kickback
money for referrals,

1407
01:16:57,413 --> 01:16:59,310
school administrators,
counselors, teachers,

1408
01:16:59,379 --> 01:17:00,793
they are on the tape.

1409
01:17:02,275 --> 01:17:05,448
Dale Carlson is my
guidance counselor.

1410
01:17:05,517 --> 01:17:08,103
Not bad, he's nine grand
richer than he was a year ago.

1411
01:17:08,172 --> 01:17:09,310
I get this into the right hands,

1412
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,275
this place goes out of business.

1413
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,172
Who are you, really.

1414
01:17:18,482 --> 01:17:19,689
My real name is Jason.

1415
01:17:19,758 --> 01:17:21,103
I'm not really 17.

1416
01:17:21,172 --> 01:17:23,000
I work for Nora Fields.
She is the one who got me

1417
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:24,034
in here to try to get
enough evidence--

1418
01:17:24,103 --> 01:17:25,310
[rattle]

1419
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:26,413
[CJ] Come on.

1420
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:36,172
CJ...

1421
01:17:37,965 --> 01:17:40,413
looks like you'll
have some explaining to do.

1422
01:17:40,482 --> 01:17:42,655
Why don't you wait outside?

1423
01:17:44,655 --> 01:17:45,827
Hmm?

1424
01:17:45,896 --> 01:17:47,206
[door creaks and closes]

1425
01:17:47,275 --> 01:17:49,172
Well, do you wanna tell me
what you were looking for?

1426
01:17:51,206 --> 01:17:54,689
Just looking around
and the door was open.

1427
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:56,344
[suspenseful music]

1428
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:07,586
Peterson...

1429
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:10,241
Colin James, nickname's, CJ.

1430
01:18:14,344 --> 01:18:16,551
[CJ]
What are you gonna do with me?

1431
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,689
[Dr. Winslow] I don't know.

1432
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:20,034
We'll go to restraint
while I decide it.

1433
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,827
It's clear that you've
become a danger,

1434
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:25,896
and not only to
yourself, but to others.

1435
01:18:25,965 --> 01:18:28,034
After all,

1436
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:31,000
starting a fire in the records
office is a serious crime.

1437
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,482
It's a good thing I
caught it in time.

1438
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,206
[phone dialing]

1439
01:18:55,758 --> 01:18:57,275
-[Man] Hello.
-[Laura] Hi, it's me.

1440
01:18:57,344 --> 01:18:59,206
-[Man] It's late.
-[Laura] I know, I know.

1441
01:18:59,275 --> 01:19:01,482
But I need you to do
something for me.

1442
01:19:13,862 --> 01:19:15,655
You're leaving?

1443
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:19,896
I was saving this for Laura.

1444
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:26,413
I wanted our beautiful baby
girl to wear this at her wedding

1445
01:19:29,896 --> 01:19:33,379
[sobbing]
Oh Robert, what happened?

1446
01:19:33,448 --> 01:19:36,034
[crying]

1447
01:19:36,103 --> 01:19:40,310
How did I push everybody
away, was I so terrible?

1448
01:19:40,379 --> 01:19:41,793
It wasn't just you.

1449
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:44,034
I-- I wanted to be perfect.

1450
01:19:44,103 --> 01:19:47,275
Some of us can't be
perfect, I'm sorry.

1451
01:19:49,724 --> 01:19:53,689
I am sorry-- I am sorry
for a lot of things, but...

1452
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:00,620
But it's too late.

1453
01:20:03,586 --> 01:20:04,827
I don't know.

1454
01:20:07,413 --> 01:20:09,206
I don't know.

1455
01:20:09,275 --> 01:20:13,758
But we can't let our problems
destroy our kids any longer.

1456
01:20:13,827 --> 01:20:16,655
We've got to save our family.

1457
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:19,344
I don't know how to do that.

1458
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:24,310
We've got to start by getting
Laura out of that place.

1459
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:28,241
Alright?

1460
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:30,862
Okay.

1461
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:36,068
[hopeful music]

1462
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:07,689
[phone rings]

1463
01:21:07,758 --> 01:21:08,965
What do we have here?

1464
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:10,413
Yeah.

1465
01:21:10,482 --> 01:21:13,034
Nora, Hi, its me Laura.

1466
01:21:13,103 --> 01:21:14,793
Sorry, Laura?

1467
01:21:14,862 --> 01:21:16,413
I'm still stuck
here in Meadowbrook.

1468
01:21:16,482 --> 01:21:17,896
Can't wait to get
out of this place.

1469
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:22,448
Laura, right, how are you?

1470
01:21:22,517 --> 01:21:24,620
Okay. I guess.

1471
01:21:24,689 --> 01:21:26,931
It seems
like ages since we've talked.

1472
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,586
Yeah. Ages.

1473
01:21:28,655 --> 01:21:30,310
Hey, it's Jason there.

1474
01:21:30,379 --> 01:21:33,206
Jason. No.

1475
01:21:33,275 --> 01:21:35,517
Jason stepped out.

1476
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:37,517
He's not in
trouble again is he?

1477
01:21:37,586 --> 01:21:38,758
No, not trouble.

1478
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,172
It's just he went out.

1479
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,275
He'll be back in a little while.

1480
01:21:41,344 --> 01:21:43,413
I'll tell him that you called.

1481
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,551
Great.
Your birthday's coming up.

1482
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,586
I haven't forgotten.

1483
01:21:46,655 --> 01:21:48,275
I have something for you.

1484
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:50,034
Jason helped me pick it out.

1485
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:51,862
But I guess he won't be
able to get it to you

1486
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:53,034
until I get out.

1487
01:21:53,103 --> 01:21:55,172
Eh--

1488
01:21:55,241 --> 01:21:57,896
Listen to my time's up.
I have to go.

1489
01:21:57,965 --> 01:22:00,965
No, Laura, just
wait a minute. Okay?

1490
01:22:01,034 --> 01:22:02,827
No, I really should go.

1491
01:22:02,896 --> 01:22:03,862
I'll call you again.

1492
01:22:03,931 --> 01:22:04,758
Laura.

1493
01:22:04,827 --> 01:22:05,931
Okay.

1494
01:22:08,241 --> 01:22:11,068
Gladys, call the
district attorney's office.

1495
01:22:11,137 --> 01:22:12,413
I'm getting the police.

1496
01:22:12,482 --> 01:22:14,724
How can all of last month's
billing records be gone?

1497
01:22:14,793 --> 01:22:16,344
I don't understand this.

1498
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,862
I told you, I don't
know where they are.

1499
01:22:26,689 --> 01:22:28,965
You're lying.

1500
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:30,413
You've hidden them somewhere.

1501
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:33,448
Even if I did know why.

1502
01:22:33,517 --> 01:22:34,931
Why would I tell you now that
I know real scam that goes on

1503
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,172
in this place.

1504
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:37,965
Scam?

1505
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:39,103
We provide a service here.

1506
01:22:39,172 --> 01:22:40,551
We save lives.

1507
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:43,758
So you need to justify
ripping off insurance companies?

1508
01:22:43,827 --> 01:22:44,931
If that's what
it takes to stop.

1509
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,517
One more kid from
slitting his wrists.

1510
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:48,689
Yes. That's how I justify it.

1511
01:22:48,758 --> 01:22:50,206
All right, that's a winner.

1512
01:22:50,275 --> 01:22:52,793
I'd love to be there to see you
explain that one to the D.A.

1513
01:22:57,379 --> 01:22:59,793
Listen to me you little punk.

1514
01:22:59,862 --> 01:23:02,275
I don't know who
you think you are

1515
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:06,413
but one phone call from me and
there is no more CJ Peterson.

1516
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:10,413
You will spend the rest of
your life in a padded room.

1517
01:23:10,482 --> 01:23:12,517
You gonna spend the
rest of yours in jail so.

1518
01:23:12,586 --> 01:23:14,482
You're gonna tell
me where files are.

1519
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,620
Kiss my--

1520
01:23:18,689 --> 01:23:21,137
[CJ grunts]

1521
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:22,965
[panting]

1522
01:23:30,655 --> 01:23:31,689
[Alright]

1523
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:39,689
Dr. Winslow, your
telephone's has been waiting

1524
01:23:39,758 --> 01:23:41,448
for over half an hour.

1525
01:23:43,448 --> 01:23:45,758
I want everyone to
confined to their rooms.

1526
01:23:54,275 --> 01:23:56,724
Dr Winslow, Hi I'm Mr.Sanders,

1527
01:23:56,793 --> 01:23:58,482
I spoke to you on the
telephone yesterday.

1528
01:23:58,551 --> 01:24:00,172
Yes Mr. Sanders, sorry
I kept you waiting. I--

1529
01:24:00,241 --> 01:24:02,344
Dr. Winslow, we've
come for Laura.

1530
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:04,413
We want her out of here with
or without your signatures.

1531
01:24:04,482 --> 01:24:06,000
Now you lied to me. I checked.

1532
01:24:06,068 --> 01:24:08,000
I did not,
it's hospital policy--

1533
01:24:08,068 --> 01:24:09,689
Fine, whatever. Where is she?

1534
01:24:11,448 --> 01:24:12,517
Forgive me.

1535
01:24:12,586 --> 01:24:13,896
Something has come
up, please excuse me.

1536
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:16,413
I'll be back in a few minutes
to start the paperwork.

1537
01:24:16,482 --> 01:24:17,620
Hey, don't walk away from me.

1538
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:19,068
We are not gonna
wait any longer.

1539
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,241
Mr. Mills. I will
tell Ms. Collins

1540
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,034
to start the release forms.

1541
01:24:36,413 --> 01:24:38,241
There's nothing in here.

1542
01:24:44,068 --> 01:24:45,862
[Security man]
I don't understand.

1543
01:24:49,655 --> 01:24:51,724
I heard you talking
to Dr. Winslow.

1544
01:24:51,793 --> 01:24:53,482
Is there some kind of
problem with this place

1545
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:56,172
that I should know about?

1546
01:24:56,241 --> 01:24:58,344
[Repair man]
I don't get it either.

1547
01:24:58,413 --> 01:25:00,758
All I know is we got a signal
down at the switching station

1548
01:25:00,827 --> 01:25:03,137
that said the problem was
coming from your cafeteria.

1549
01:25:03,206 --> 01:25:04,241
[Nurse] Oh yeah?

1550
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:09,655
It's just ridiculous.

1551
01:25:09,724 --> 01:25:12,000
I'm not gonna wait for them.

1552
01:25:15,275 --> 01:25:18,241
I want you to go get Laura,
we haven't got all day.

1553
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,965
I don't know if I can do that.

1554
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,620
Oh, I think you can.

1555
01:25:46,103 --> 01:25:48,758
[Ms. Collins] Dr. Winslow...

1556
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:50,586
her parents
won't wait any longer.

1557
01:25:50,655 --> 01:25:52,000
All right. Take her out.
I won't be long.

1558
01:26:06,103 --> 01:26:08,689
[Nurse]
Dr. Winslow, the ward is clear.

1559
01:26:16,965 --> 01:26:19,482
Dr. Winslow.

1560
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:21,172
You dropped this.

1561
01:26:29,965 --> 01:26:32,689
[dramatic music]

1562
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:50,172
Ms. Collins!

1563
01:26:50,241 --> 01:26:51,896
[grunts]

1564
01:26:51,965 --> 01:26:53,241
[Ms. Collins] Come on! Get her!

1565
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,724
-[Robert] Come on--
-[Laura] Dad!

1566
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,137
Dad! Get off me!

1567
01:26:56,206 --> 01:26:57,275
[Robert] Laura!

1568
01:26:58,655 --> 01:27:00,000
[Dr. Winslow] Calm down.

1569
01:27:00,068 --> 01:27:00,965
[Laura] Let me go!

1570
01:27:01,034 --> 01:27:02,172
[Dr. Winslow] Calm down.

1571
01:27:02,241 --> 01:27:03,275
Let me go.

1572
01:27:03,344 --> 01:27:05,448
Laura, don't make a scene.

1573
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:06,517
She doesn't have it!

1574
01:27:06,586 --> 01:27:07,965
Let her go or
I'll call the police.

1575
01:27:08,034 --> 01:27:09,344
[Dr. Winslow] We have reason to
believe that your daughter

1576
01:27:09,413 --> 01:27:11,172
is hiding drugs in her room.

1577
01:27:11,241 --> 01:27:13,103
He's lying I don't know
what he's talking about.

1578
01:27:13,172 --> 01:27:14,551
We're taking our
daughter over here.

1579
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:17,413
Now this patient has a
borderline personality disorder.

1580
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,241
She is a danger to herself
and to everyone around her.

1581
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,724
Dr. Winslow, I want to see CJ.

1582
01:27:21,793 --> 01:27:23,620
If you take her out of here now
you're going to be liable--

1583
01:27:23,689 --> 01:27:25,275
Dr. Winslow!

1584
01:27:25,344 --> 01:27:27,655
We have a warrant to
search these premises.

1585
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,379
What the hell was that
all about anyway?

1586
01:27:31,448 --> 01:27:33,448
It's a long story,
I'll tell you later.

1587
01:27:39,413 --> 01:27:42,379
I don't know what to
say, these things happen.

1588
01:27:42,448 --> 01:27:43,517
Thank you.

1589
01:27:43,586 --> 01:27:44,896
Thanks.

1590
01:27:47,689 --> 01:27:49,000
Yes!

1591
01:28:46,931 --> 01:28:48,344
You're about ready?

1592
01:28:48,413 --> 01:28:50,172
Yeah, almost.

1593
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:51,724
You might wanna leave
some of this stuff.

1594
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:52,724
My place ain't that big.

1595
01:28:52,793 --> 01:28:55,000
[Laura chuckles]

1596
01:28:55,068 --> 01:28:56,965
[David sighs]

1597
01:28:58,965 --> 01:29:01,931
Folks getting along any better?

1598
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,379
They're trying.

1599
01:29:06,172 --> 01:29:08,413
So what's the verdict
on the college thing?

1600
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:12,103
I just told 'em

1601
01:29:12,172 --> 01:29:13,896
that I needed some time
to sort things out.

1602
01:29:13,965 --> 01:29:15,241
Maybe I'll go next year.

1603
01:29:18,068 --> 01:29:19,413
[grunts]

1604
01:29:19,482 --> 01:29:20,689
All right. Let's do it.

1605
01:29:31,655 --> 01:29:33,206
[Michelle] You have everything?

1606
01:29:33,275 --> 01:29:34,344
Yeah.

1607
01:29:34,413 --> 01:29:35,655
Did you want to take your TV?

1608
01:29:35,724 --> 01:29:38,655
No need still got the
one I stole from you guys.

1609
01:29:38,724 --> 01:29:40,448
Right.

1610
01:29:40,517 --> 01:29:41,827
[Robert sighs]

1611
01:29:45,241 --> 01:29:49,344
So Laura, just wanna make
sure that you know that...

1612
01:29:49,413 --> 01:29:50,931
your father and I
don't want you to go.

1613
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,482
Mom, leave it alone,
it's her decision.

1614
01:29:52,551 --> 01:29:53,482
I'm telling her how I feel.

1615
01:29:53,551 --> 01:29:54,517
[David]
Mom, it's her decision--

1616
01:29:54,586 --> 01:29:55,655
[Michelle]
I'm telling her how--

1617
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:56,793
Every time is going to
be like that?

1618
01:29:56,862 --> 01:29:58,517
Will you guys please
just stop fighting?

1619
01:29:58,586 --> 01:29:59,724
[sighs heavily]

1620
01:30:02,103 --> 01:30:03,068
[sighs]
Let's get out of here.

1621
01:30:03,137 --> 01:30:04,310
[Robert]
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1622
01:30:06,655 --> 01:30:08,827
This is ridiculous.

1623
01:30:08,896 --> 01:30:10,931
You're right.

1624
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,586
I don't want to fight anymore.

1625
01:30:12,655 --> 01:30:14,448
We've all made
a lot of mistakes.

1626
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,827
We love you.

1627
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,413
Um...

1628
01:30:26,103 --> 01:30:28,310
Maybe you can come by
for dinner this weekend.

1629
01:30:31,931 --> 01:30:33,310
Both of you.

1630
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:38,413
Mom's cooking.

1631
01:30:38,482 --> 01:30:39,517
[chuckles]

1632
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:47,310
Could be dangerous.

1633
01:30:52,896 --> 01:30:54,551
I think we'd like that.

1634
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,793
[smiles]

1635
01:30:58,862 --> 01:30:59,896
Bye.
