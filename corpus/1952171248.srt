<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@FadeOut Sync:FRM@Uranus</font>

3
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,051
Another runner.
Did you get a plate?

4
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,511
Are you kidding me?

5
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,971
Total disrespect.

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,597
Don't these idiots get it?

7
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,474
If you're going to roll,
you pay the toll.

8
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,269
Well, if we don't catch them,
the camera will.

9
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,703
WOMAN IN CAR:
Stop, you're hurting me.

10
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,245
(engine roars)

11
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,705
What about your change?

12
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,756
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,883
What is it?

14
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,890
I'm calling the police.

15
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,487
(indistinct police
radio transmission)

16
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,911
Tollbooth witness
couldn't see the driver.

17
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,996
Said the car was charcoal gray.

18
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,581
What about the passenger?

19
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,957
Nothing,
except she was female.

20
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,001
Female,
no hard ID.

21
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,378
Our mystery girl
did leave us this.

22
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,173
Looks like blood.

23
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,301
CAINE:
"He's going to kill me!"

24
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,719
Think it's a prank?

25
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,888
No such luck, Frank.

26
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,978
* Yeah! *

27
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,584
* We don't get fooled again *

28
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,755
* Don't get fooled again *

29
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,006
* No, no! *

30
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,332
??What did Hemotrace say?

31
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,458
Blood's human.

32
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,210
Dispatch says you wanted
the AV equipment.

33
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,337
Let's check the cameras
in these booths.

34
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,713
They may have something.

35
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,465
If I find something,
where you going to be?

36
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,718
We just found a body,
right down this road.

37
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,332
Powdery substance on her leg.

38
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,167
Could be soil.

39
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,211
Doesn't look like
it's from around here.

40
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,463
Who found the body?

41
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,258
Jet skier.
Taking a break.

42
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:03,053
Horatio, she was
definitely restrained.

43
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,222
Marks are parallel.

44
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,974
Looks like something rigid.

45
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,852
Maybe from handcuffs.
What about those nails, Alexx?

46
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,062
Broken, worn down.

47
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,522
Could be acrylic.

48
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,191
Wherever she was,
she tried to claw her way out.

49
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,112
(screams)

50
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,867
CAINE:
I.D.

51
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,577
Miss Leslie Anderson.

52
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,873
Pretty girl.

53
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,083
Think she's the one
from the tollbooth?

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,543
Could be.

55
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,383
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

56
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,140
WOLFE:
Hi.

57
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,641
This the surveillance video?

58
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,768
Yeah, it was downloaded
from the tollbooth.

59
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,770
Okay, here's
where the car comes in.

60
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,356
WOLFE:
The passenger compartment's
no good at this angle.

61
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,691
You get a plate?

62
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,986
It doesn't make any sense.

63
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,572
The numbers are distorted,
but the car is in focus.

64
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,449
They got a PhotoShield;
people use them to beat

65
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,159
overhead cameras
at traffic lights.

66
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,119
But I can't make out anything.

67
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,623
Well, it's transparent;
it uses a thin diffusion lens.

68
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,167
 <i>Light at an oblique angle</i></i>

69
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:19,004
 <i>causes the cover</i>
 <i>to reflect and refract.</i></i>

70
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,549
It makes it
impossibleo read

71
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,092
unless you're
directly behind it.

72
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,971
DUQUESNE:
So somebody really wanted
this car to be anonymous.

73
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,765
This missing girl's
in a lot of trouble, huh?

74
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,475
Yeah.

75
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,726
You got
another angle?

76
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,187
It's hard to see
the driver

77
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,147
because there's sunlight
reflected off the windshield.

78
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,359
There's something
under the wiper blade.

79
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,486
WOLFE:
It's a valet stub.

80
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,113
Those numbers or that logo could
help us find the neighborhood.

81
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:45,989
You know what?

82
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,076
Let's see if we can take
a better look at the passenger.

83
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,077
All right, so this is where

84
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,621
she hands the bloody bill
to the witness.

85
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,499
Wait a minute.

86
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,418
Check out her arm.
It's ligature marks.

87
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,962
Oh, yeah, look
at the bruising.

88
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,964
Horatio said
that the victim at the jetty

89
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,424
had the same thing.

90
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,763
(elevator bell dings)

91
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,724
Horatio.

92
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,895
I finished the post
from our vic on the rocks,
Leslie Anderson.

93
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,147
She had a broken frenulum.

94
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,443
So she was suffocated.

95
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,445
I also did
a photo comparison

96
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,239
with the girl from the car
and our vic.

97
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,867
Ligature marks are ckssistent.

98
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,159
The bottom line, Alexx:

99
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,120
they were attacked
by the same predator.

100
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,914
Leslie Anderson was dead
at least two days

101
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,374
before she was discovered.

102
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,585
And our missing girl
is still out there.

103
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,629
Thank you, Alexx.

104
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,432
Hey.
Hi.

105
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,143
It's the trace
from Leslie Anderson's pants.

106
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,648
Yep. Silicon dioxide
and aluminum oxide.

107
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,441
It's clay dust.

108
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,484
No, I get that,
but what's the gray stuff?

109
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,444
It's mortar.

110
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,321
Like from
a clay tile?
Mm-hmm.

111
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,657
75 years ago, mortar was used
without additional fasteners.

112
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,659
Now it's wired
or nailed secured.

113
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,413
So this could be like
from an historical building?

114
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,290
Yeah. Well, this
amount of trace,

115
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,459
the vic had to be around
a lot of clay dust.

116
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,629
Sorry to interrupt, you guys.
Uh, valet stub.

117
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,089
I ID'd the company logo.
Yeah.

118
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,049
You got an address?

119
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,718
Yeah, it's a neighborhood
restaurant in the Gables.

120
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,762
You know who eats there.

121
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,889
People who live
in the neighborhood.

122
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,098
(chuckles)

123
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,188
This restaurant puts us
a block away from a building

124
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,315
that's over 100 years old.

125
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,957
According to the bank records,
this place is in foreclosure.

126
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,084
So what, our suspe
is squatting here?

127
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,294
No rent,
no questions asked.

128
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,171
Looks abandoned to me.

129
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,675
Clay tile.

130
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,718
A trace from our victim.

131
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,522
Frank.

132
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,608
No.

133
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:28,861
Stop it!

134
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,362
(screaming)

135
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,198
Our murder vic was
definitely here.

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,700
(footsteps approach)

137
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,369
Freeze! Don't move!
Hands, mister.

138
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,037
I'll shoot you
where you stand.

139
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,005
You e owner?

140
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,967
Tommy Boyer.

141
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,429
Hook him up.

142
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,022
I'll call Horatio.

143
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,779
I don't know Leslie Anderson.

144
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,992
She was suffocated two days ago
d evidence leads us to you.

145
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,166
My-my fiance, Jill Girrard,

146
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,459
we're supposed
to be married in a week.

147
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,128
She went off with some friends,
never came back.

148
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,923
That still doesn't explain
why you were in the building.

149
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:31,965
I got desperate.

150
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,968
Jill and I are on the TeleAid
account for the Mercedes.

151
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,428
They gave me the address.

152
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,096
I figured she
got cold feet.

153
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,265
Ran off with
some rich guy.

154
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,934
Didn't have the guts to tell me.

155
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,229
I went inside to take a look.

156
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,333
 <i>Her car was there.She wasn't.</i></i>

157
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,086
That's when you
guys found me.

158
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,129
I-I don't know Leslie Anderson.

159
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,131
I certainly didn't
suffocate her.

160
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,217
Do you have
a photograph of Jill?

161
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,885
Yeah, I do.

162
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,472
I'm also going to need
a personaltem,

163
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,516
like a hairbrush.

164
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,601
Please, help me find her,
Lieutenant.

165
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,229
I'll do that.

166
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,484
TRIPP:
That's one solid safe.

167
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,752
You know, my uncle
was a safecracker.

168
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,880
He taught me
when I was 11.

169
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,423
That's pretty cool.

170
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,925
Hope there's not a body inside.

171
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:02,973
(clicks)

172
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,899
They're not bodies.

173
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,444
I think they're something worse.

174
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,030
They're trophies.

175
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,824
TRIPP:
Necklace, underwear, glasses?

176
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,161
WOLFE:
This is a picture
of Leslie Anderson.

177
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,787
Let's get this
stuff out of here.

178
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,707
And, Frank, put on some gloves.

179
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,293
These are our only link
to the killer.

180
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,763
Did you process
the fiance's Meedes?

181
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,348
Yeah, nothing.

182
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,767
The onlyhing that we have
to go on for the passenger

183
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,477
in the tollbooth is
the five-dollar bill.

184
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,853
Yeah, well,
the blood on the bill

185
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,230
didn't match
Leslie Anderson

186
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,440
or the DNA from
Jill Girrard's hairbrush.

187
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,901
So there's a chance our mystery
girl could be one of these.

188
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:56,944
Yeah.

189
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,408
I think these pictures were
taken by somebody they trusted.

190
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,994
Yeah, you're right.

191
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:06,954
They don't look afraid.

192
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,206
It's like he got them to go
with him willingly somehow.

193
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,457
Hey.

194
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,583
These the photos
from the safe?

195
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,585
Yeah, Ryan found them.

196
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,087
We're processing
the blood from DNA.

197
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,882
We're going to see
if one of these girls kicks out.

198
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,217
Oh, my God.
What?

199
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,010
That-That's Anya.
Who's Anya?

200
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,178
(cell phone beeps)

201
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,304
(spe dialing)

202
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:26,181
BOA VISTA:
Voicemail.

203
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,933
Anya, it's me,
um, I'm...

204
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,811
I'm worried, so call me.

205
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,690
Will you just keep
hitting "redial"?

206
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,192
I'm gonna go
check something out.

207
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,989
Who's Anya?

208
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,833
Are those the samples
for the DNA bill?

209
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,543
Yeah. They're almost
ready for the 310.

210
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,545
I've got one more
sample for you.

211
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,172
You worked in here, Natalia.

212
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,381
You know
the evidence submissions

213
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,841
are processed in order.

214
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,634
So you can wait
for the next run.

215
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:06,180
Valera, one of those pictures
is of my sister.

216
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,264
That rates a jump.

217
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,227
Please compare this
against these other samples.

218
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,145
I'm sorry. I...

219
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,938
Just do it now, okay?

220
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,992
* *

221
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,312
(printer running)

222
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,945
Miss Boa Vista?

223
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,780
What's going on?

224
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:09,159
The girl
in the tollbooth car

225
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,954
is my sister.

226
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,330
We have to find her,
Lieutenant.

227
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,375
We will.

228
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,182
SIKES:
Lieutenant Caine,

229
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,517
who are the women
in these photographs?

230
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,602
As you can see,
some of the women behind me

231
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,062
have yet to be identified.

232
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,063
Where did these photographs
come from?

233
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,190
We recovered the photographs
from a locked safe

234
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,317
during the execution
of a search warrant.

235
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,527
Is that person a suspect?

236
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,153
Is there anyone
in custody?

237
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,655
Lieutenant,

238
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,323
who are these girls?

239
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,909
While I'm not at liberty
to discuss the details

240
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,578
of an ongoing investigation,

241
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,788
I can say that any help
that the public gives us

242
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,374
in identifying these women
will be deeply,

243
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,585
and I mean deeply, appreciated.

244
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:00,544
Thank you.

245
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,296
(reporters clamoring)

246
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,800
Thank you.

247
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,427
Lieutenant, thank you
for not mentioning my sister.

248
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:09,720
No problem.

249
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,431
How do you think her photograph
ended up in this gallery?

250
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:13,974
Ever since
she was a little girl,

251
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,142
she always wanted to be a star.

252
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,144
She loved having
her picture taken.

253
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,813
Okay, when was the last time
you talked to her?

254
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,356
A few days.
Okay.

255
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,067
Take a uniform,
go to her apartment,

256
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,861
and go through it
with a fine-tooth comb.

257
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:26,820
What am I
looking for?

258
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,323
Anything related
to her last 24 hours.

259
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,876
You're gonna have to
get your soundbites
somewhere else.

260
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,794
Actually, I wanted
to ask you a favor

261
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,840
The answer is "no."

262
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,758
Come on, I heard
you were letting

263
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,093
a documentary film guy
follow you around.

264
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,929
No comment.

265
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,597
I got to get
back to work.

266
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,516
Boa Vista's missing sister?

267
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,436
You're not fooling
me this time.

268
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,147
I've already got it in deep
background that it's her sister.

269
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,815
Ex-husband says she has two.

270
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,276
Is it Christine
or Anya?

271
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,695
You're literally
the worst.

272
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,989
You know that, right?

273
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,157
You can't release that.

274
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,325
You could get
the girl killed.

275
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,077
What do you want to bet
in under 20 minutes,

276
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,411
I'll know which girl?

277
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,549
SASHA:
Natalia?

278
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,716
Is everything okay?

279
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,678
She lives here.

280
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,055
I just got back
from a tryout

281
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,265
for a reality show--

282
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,100
 <i>South Beach Babes.</i></i>

283
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,269
I think I really have
a chance this time.

284
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:41,854
Where's Anya?

285
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,730
Um, that's why I'm here.

286
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,274
Anya's missing.

287
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,651
When was the last time
you saw her?

288
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,028
Um, yeah, I talked
to her two days ago.

289
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,781
She got a callback
for a modeling shoot.

290
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:53,615
She's so lucky.

291
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,075
The guy promised
her a cover.

292
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,660
Do you know anything
about this guy?

293
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:59,580
He was, like,
really old, like 35.

294
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,623
But, I mean, he sounded
nice on the machine.

295
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,083
Okay.

296
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,960
Do you mind
if I take it with me?

297
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,254
Yeah, sure, I give out my
cell number for callbacks.

298
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,716
I'm sure she's fine.
She's very careful.

299
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,050
Okay, look, Sasha,
do me a favor, please.

300
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,136
Don't go on any callbacks
until this is over.

301
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:15,804
Please.

302
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,723
Okay.

303
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,308
But she's fine.

304
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,454
There's nothing.

305
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,164
Whoever these belong
to was very careful.

306
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,167
Horatio seems to think
the guy's a photographer.

307
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,293
That makes sense.

308
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,961
You think that these
are color copies?

309
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,547
No, take a look.

310
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,758
Oh, yeah, that's pretty grainy.

311
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,259
Rules out digital.

312
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,053
Film is black and white.

313
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,097
(camera clicking)

314
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,536
Why would a photographer
prefer a low-resolution image?

315
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,329
Going for a distinct look.

316
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,331
There's not a lot of places that
develop black and white film.

317
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,332
I'll go make some calls.

318
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,834
To photo shops in Miami,

319
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,710
the model shoot capital
of the world?

320
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,087
(chuckles)

321
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:33,215
I think you're gonna be making
a lot of phone calls.

322
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,593
Have fun.

323
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:36,677
(camera shutter clicking)

324
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,470
MAN:
That's it, baby.

325
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,555
Give me sexy.

326
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,889
Perfect.

327
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,726
Hold that look.

328
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,937
All right, I want sexy,
not slutty.

329
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,605
Come on. Give me sexy.

330
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,863
DUQUESNE:
Did you get a name for the black
and white specialist?

331
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,030
Well, Homicide
pointed me towards

332
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,991
this photo developing
place downtown.

333
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,909
All the high-end
photographers use it.

334
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:01,910
It's owned by
this German guy,

335
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,122
and he says that our man's
name is John Stockman.

336
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,792
Calleigh Duquesne,
ueRyan Wolfe, MDPD.

337
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,627
These girls are all of age.

338
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,087
I've checked every one
of them out, personally.

339
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,339
What about the photographers?
Do you check them out, as well?

340
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,925
Look, what is this?

341
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,343
We're looking for John Stockman.

342
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,138
Shoots in black and white;
thinks he's Ansel Adams.

343
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,560
Thank you.

344
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,439
Give me sensual.

345
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:30,856
(camera clicking)

346
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,358
All these girls,
they have the wrong dreams.

347
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,277
I don't know
that their dreams are bad,

348
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,238
just the people who promise
to make them come true.

349
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,948
John Stockman?

350
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah, what
do you need?

351
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,493
Your DNA.

352
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,455
Excuse me?

353
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,924
I don't understand
what I'm doing here.

354
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,219
Oh, no,
I think you do.

355
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,264
You took all the photos
of these girls.

356
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,933
I take a lot of photos.

357
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,101
Yeah, but your camera's
a single lens reflex.

358
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,353
That's right.

359
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,606
And you use dual-edge
black and white film.

360
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,108
It gives my work detail.

361
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,443
Hmm.

362
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:21,031
And the fact that you keep these
in a safe with murder trophies

363
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,825
in an abandoned
building--

364
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,743
is that just a coincidence?

365
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,829
You want to pin that on me?

366
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,248
I hope you have proof.

367
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,833
(cell phone ringing)

368
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,382
This is Wolfe.

369
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:40,425
Yep.

370
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,682
Your DNA matches
the semen we found

371
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,560
in Leslie Anderson's underwear.

372
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,603
You feeling pinned?

373
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,314
That proves I had sex with her.

374
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,609
It's a photographer's perk.

375
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,862
Where'd this
little hookup occur?

376
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,282
In her dressing room,
after the shoot.

377
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,367
* *

378
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,291
It was sex.

379
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,585
Nothing criminal.

380
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,461
Anyone could've stolen my photos

381
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,130
and put them in that safe.

382
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:21,300
Well, then I'm gonna need
a list of those "anyones."

383
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,345
Erica Sikes reporting.

384
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,139
Sources say there's
a personal connection

385
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,600
at the Miami-Dade Crime Lab
to the current murder case.

386
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,476
MDPD Criminalist

387
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,188
Natalia Boa Vista,
this morning identified her own

388
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,064
sister's picture
from among the photos

389
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,274
of the missing girls.

390
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,567
That's right.
ghtalia.

391
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,110
One of the missing
and perhaps dead...

392
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,195
There's something
you should know about.

393
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,155
(cell phone rings)
What?

394
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,198
Oh, my God.
It's my sister.

395
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,491
Anya?
ANYA (on phone):
Natalia.

396
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,575
Where are you?

397
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,076
I only have a second.
I'm in a house.

398
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,661
I think it's near the water.
I don't know...

399
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,662
An...

400
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,505
They're going to kill her, Ryan.

401
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,923
Listen, no, listen.

402
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:03,133
If she called, it means
she's still alive, right?

403
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,885
So focus. What'd you get

404
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:05,969
from the answering
machine?

405
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,472
Um... nothing.
I got nothing.

406
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,225
I have listened to this
a thousand times.

407
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,144
There's no ambient
sound. Listen.

408
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,521
MALE VOICE (on recorder):
Anya, it's me.

409
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,272
Your pics are ready.

410
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:18,440
These are the ones, baby.

411
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,441
Call me.

412
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,984
You've got the number.
See?

413
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,277
There's no accent.

414
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,113
I mean, this could be
any guy out there.
Not really.

415
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,116
I think I know that voice.

416
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,451
From where?

417
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,788
The model shoot.

418
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,918
Mr. Laporte,
you placed a call

419
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,838
to Anya Boa Vista.

420
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,257
I did?

421
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,633
You did.
(plays tape)

422
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,260
LAPORTE (on tape):
Anya, it's me.

423
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,011
Your pics are ready.

424
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:48,971
These are the ones, baby.

425
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,806
Call me. You've got the number.

426
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,725
(laughs):
Right.

427
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,478
Yeah, her. I called her to let
her know her proofs were ready.

428
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,688
Go on.

429
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,023
You should really be
talking to Stockman.

430
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,900
All right, he's the one
doing all the models.

431
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:03,527
You have quite a history, too,

432
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,445
which includes
a rape charge, doesn't it?

433
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:07,990
I was acquitted.
Yes,

434
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,992
but that doesn't mean
you're innocent.

435
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,577
Does it?

436
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,581
I'm just a guy
who processed her proofs.

437
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,293
But I can help you, Lieutenant.

438
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:20,878
I know what goes on

439
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,546
between model and photographer.

440
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,965
Describe it  me.

441
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,258
All about fame.

442
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,552
Hey, and these girls,
they all want it so bad.

443
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,345
So you point a camera at them,

444
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,597
you get them to do
whatever you want.

445
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,931
They'll take their shirts off.

446
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,058
They'll hop into bed
with you. Anything.

447
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,228
That's what you did,
Mr. Laporte. Isn't it?

448
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,316
You prove that, let me know.

449
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,151
I guarantee it.

450
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,541
No, no. That's too much
backlight there.

451
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,210
To the right.

452
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,796
To the right.

453
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,173
Hey. News chick.

454
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,716
Do you realize

455
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,301
that you signed
my sister's death warrant?

456
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,220
I know you're angry, but I'm
just reporting the facts.

457
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,388
You tied her to law enforcement.

458
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,723
That makes her
a primary target.

459
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,391
DUQUESNE:
Nat.
Do you deny that?

460
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,894
This is exactly what she wants.
Don't give it to her, okay?

461
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,355
I'll meet you inside.

462
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,489
You do understand where I'm
coming from, don't you?

463
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,115
I do. I understand
you have a job to do

464
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,659
just like the rest of us.
Thank you.

465
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,494
I also understand
that your need for attention

466
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,412
may have put these girls'
lives in even more danger.

467
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,374
 <i>My</i> need for attention?
Mm-hmm.</i>

468
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,043
You didn't just report the news;
you chose a salacious angle.

469
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,378
That's more
attention for you.

470
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,546
I'm a journalist.

471
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,381
I want my attention
on my stories.

472
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,424
If that were true, sweet pea,

473
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,843
you'd be writing
for a newspaper

474
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,554
not planting your face
on the evening news.

475
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,305
Have a nice day.

476
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,062
(elevator bell dings)

477
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,314
Lieutenant Caine.

478
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,358
Mr. Boyer.

479
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,318
I just got home
and found this in the mail.

480
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,529
It's a letter from Jill.

481
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,489
What does it say?

482
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,159
It says that we're through.
The wedding's off,

483
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,077
that I shouldn't even
bother trying to find her.

484
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,455
Man, this doesn't
sound like her.

485
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,291
After your press conference,
I know something's wrong.

486
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:26,795
Mr. Boyer, I need you to
leave that letter with me.

487
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,631
You think it'll help?

488
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,757
I know it's gonna help.

489
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,973
So Horatio told me
you're processing the paper.

490
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,474
Why aren't you in QD?

491
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:40,893
'Cause I got what
I needed in there.

492
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,644
Which was what?

493
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:43,937
This paper's store-bought.

494
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,064
It's, um... it's untraceable.

495
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,358
But this logo's gonna help us.

496
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,653
See that? It's embossed.

497
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,572
So someone modified
the paper themselves?

498
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,449
The paper passes through
and each time, uh...

499
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,159
the sheet gets pressed.

500
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:03,916
All right.

501
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,209
Well, again, why
are we in here?

502
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,211
Embossing machines
have many uses.

503
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,587
I noticed there was
a little bit of trace

504
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,506
on the outer edge
of the imprint.

505
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,466
A little trace from
whatever was being embossed

506
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,051
before the paper.

507
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,650
"Trivalent chromium sulfate."

508
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,778
That's used
in the pparation of leather.

509
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,863
That's right; the higher
the concentration
of the tannins,

510
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:35,989
the higher the quality.

511
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:36,824
So whatever this business is,

512
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:39,201
it deals in high-quality
leathers.

513
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,286
I'll call Calleigh.

514
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,051
Good afternoon, officers.
Bill Starr.

515
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,553
Bill Starr's Custom Upholstery.

516
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,680
No snappy catchphrase?

517
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,348
Look around.
I don't need one.

518
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,767
Maybe you can explain to us
why a missing girl

519
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,727
would write a "Dear Jo"
on your letterhead.

520
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,981
I don't know. Busy place.

521
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:10,524
Hand those out like candy.

522
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,404
What?

523
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,906
We have our own theories.

524
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,289
Can you read
that plate for me?

525
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,918
It's blocked like the car
at the tollbooth.

526
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,272
I got Anya's blood.

527
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:53,108
She cut herself on purpose
so we could ID her.

528
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:09,416
MAN:
Pay the toll, bitch.

529
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,341
Who owns that car?

530
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,842
I don't know. Uh, I forget.

531
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:20,260
The guy dropped it off

532
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,470
for reupholstery.

533
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,388
He didn't leave his name,
only an address.

534
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:25,682
I t the info inside.

535
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,267
Oh, great. You can give
me the address.

536
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,685
You can give him the car.

537
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,330
Miami-Dade Police.

538
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:09,101
Who is ever behind that door,
I want you to open it slowly

539
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:11,144
by the count of three
or I'going

540
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,188
to kick it down. One...

541
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,733
Two... three.

542
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,194
Jill?
Yes.

543
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,988
Jill Girrard.

544
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,781
You're okay now.

545
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,117
Let me help you up.

546
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,078
Jill, we know this is
incredibly difficult,

547
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,746
but is there anything
that you can tell us

548
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:31,123
about what happened?

549
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,335
I answered an ad
to get my portrait taken.

550
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,753
It was supposed to be

551
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,839
an engagement gift
for my fiance.

552
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,424
Your fiance, Tommy.

553
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,760
The guy left a message
on my answering machine.

554
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,179
Okay, did he leave a name?

555
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,015
No, he just told me to meet him
at his place in the Gables.

556
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,186
Hello?

557
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,981
Hello?

558
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,191
(gasps)

559
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,358
Do you by any chance

560
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,235
have the answering
machine message or...?

561
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,237
I erased it.

562
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,947
Did his voice
sound familiar?

563
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,824
Just a guy.

564
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,285
All I remember
is being put in a car.

565
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,579
He had something over my head.

566
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,664
So you couldn't identify him.

567
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:14,541
What about when you
were in the car,

568
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,543
did you hear noise?

569
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,711
Could you notice
anything?

570
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:19,922
There was another girl.

571
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,089
Was it Anya?

572
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:22,966
I don't know
what her name was.

573
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,010
She couldn't stop crying;
we drove around

574
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,679
for a bit, made a stop
and then suddenly she was gone.

575
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,433
I figured I was next.

576
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:34,019
Did he hurt you in any way?

577
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,359
Ma'am. We're gonna get you
to the hospital.

578
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,197
Hang in there.

579
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,282
(indistinct radio dispatch)

580
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,921
WOLFE:
Remember: eyes, no hands.

581
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,865
What is it?
Do you see something?

582
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:29,449
Yeah, this door

583
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,034
locks on both sides.

584
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:33,912
If you want to keep
someone in a room,

585
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,747
why would you have it
keyed fromhe inside?

586
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,417
Unless you want to be locked
in here with them.

587
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,796
Sorry. I, uh, I didn't
mean to imply...

588
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,090
No, no, um...

589
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,135
we need to know
what we're dealing with.

590
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,848
(clears throat)

591
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,527
Oh, my God.

592
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:08,238
Natalia, don't touch that.
Oh. Okay,
but that's Anya's.

593
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:09,281
I got that for her
last Christmas.

594
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:11,200
Okay, but you can't collect
evidence in this case.

595
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:16,663
She was here.

596
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,082
And we just missed her.

597
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,338
Calleigh, honey, Horatio
asked me to check in

598
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,673
on your victim Jill Girrard
at the hospital.

599
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,258
Yeah, how's she doing?

600
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,927
Well, I spoke
to the SART nurse,

601
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:32,429
and she found
several contusions on Jill

602
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,723
that were consistent
with her account of the attack.

603
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,267
What about the
sexual assault exam?

604
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:38,560
Get this.

605
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:41,021
There were no
physical findings.

606
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,565
Really?
In fact,

607
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,983
based on the exam,

608
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:48,111
she's never even had
sexual intercourse.

609
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:48,779
That doesn't make sense.

610
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,489
Why would somebody lie
about being raped?

611
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,368
Take a look at this.

612
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,790
She swallowed a key.

613
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,708
HORATIO:
Miami-Dade Police

614
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,849
(coughs)

615
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,439
What about this one?

616
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,358
Anya Boa Vista.

617
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:29,486
I've never seen her.

618
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:32,072
You weren't being held captive,
were you?

619
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,615
What are you talking about?

620
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,659
An abdominal x-ray shows
that you swallowed a key,

621
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,245
and my bet is that that key
opens the lock on the boat.

622
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,419
He told me I was special.

623
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:48,505
Please.

624
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:50,257
Don't.

625
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,968
I've never done it before.

626
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,144
That I was different
than the rest.

627
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,146
Tell me what happened.

628
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,775
He made me watch.

629
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:14,031
Please! No!

630
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:20,245
(grunting)

631
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,164
He called me
his girlfriend.

632
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,208
He made me write
that letter to Tommy.

633
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,335
So Tommy wouldn't try
and find you.

634
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,045
I was so scared.

635
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:30,547
Told me to go to the boat.
Pick up a necklace.

636
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,633
He let you go to the boat alone?
No.

637
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,302
I was never alone.

638
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:38,764
He was testing me.

639
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,351
When the cops showed up at
the boat, I had to do something.

640
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:43,810
I couldn't screw it up.

641
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,063
So you protected him.

642
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:51,193
He said bad girls
always die the slowest.

643
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:55,030
What's his name?

644
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,617
I...

645
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,703
I can't. I'm sorry.

646
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,417
Why me?

647
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,338
Why did he spare me?

648
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,132
Just be gratefull that he did.

649
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:21,390
So, uh, the runaway bride,

650
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,141
Jill, went Stockholm on us.

651
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:26,478
That poor girl, man,
she's so messed up.

652
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,814
She won't be so poor
after she signs a book deal.

653
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:30,691
You think she's faking?

654
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,278
I think she's getting her wish.

655
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:35,737
To be famous?

656
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,489
She'll be living off
of this for years.

657
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,158
You know,
she's really traumatized.

658
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,201
That kind of hell
she went through,

659
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,286
it's not easy to deal with.

660
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,371
Yeah, well,
ask Natalia about that.

661
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,166
All I know, is this girl could
be saving Anya's life

662
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,292
and she's not talking.

663
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:48,750
Well, you know what?

664
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,085
She's not going to tell us,

665
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,796
maybe this car will.

666
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:08,520
I got something.

667
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,942
Some kind of rock or mineral.

668
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,569
You mean clay?

669
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,071
No, it's coarse.
Looks like granite.

670
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,492
 Killers have a comfort zone
for body dumps.

671
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,368
If that's granite...

672
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:25,954
There's only
one place: jetty.

673
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,039
It's government cut.

674
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,714
Officers, she's going
to be somewhere

675
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,841
underneath these rocks.

676
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,473
The tide's rising.
Let's pick up our pace.

677
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:50,687
This quadrant's clear.

678
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,189
Moving to the next section.

679
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:53,148
Eric, we're running

680
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,650
out of time;
this tide is rising.

681
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,280
H, move to your right.

682
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,156
She's two rocks over.

683
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:03,283
Two rocks ahead
of you right there.

684
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,411
Yeah, right there.

685
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,038
She's right there.

686
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,459
Ma'am, hang on.
Gentlemen, hurry please.

687
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:13,794
Ma'am, we're going to get you
out of there right now.

688
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,420
Who did this to you?

689
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,548
Gavin. He's got another girl.

690
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:19,675
It's got to be Anya.
Where are they?

691
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,093
They're at the studio.

692
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,428
(police siren blaring)

693
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:32,855
(tires screeching)

694
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,269
What you crying for?

695
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,897
This is it. This
is what you want.

696
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,690
This is your dream, baby.

697
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,026
You're making
it all happen.

698
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:23,697
Anya.

699
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,073
Get on your knees.

700
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,162
I'll make you a star.

701
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,209
Gavin Laporte.

702
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,753
Miami-Dade Police.
Let her go.

703
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,505
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

704
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:40,756
Come on. Let's go.

705
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:41,882
Move it.

706
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,970
Help! Please

707
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,848
I'm here, Anya.
Here I come.

708
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,896
Let's go.

709
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:17,751
That's far enough, Gavin.

710
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:18,836
Now,

711
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,254
put the gun
on the ground

712
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,839
or I blow your brains out.

713
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,799
Do it.

714
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:31,348
OFFICER:
