00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:19,702
- Look at this,
look at this, honey.

4
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:20,534
Grab the camera.

5
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:22,034
Our little Roger's
playing basketball.

6
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:22,951
You know what I think?

7
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,826
He grows up, he's
gonna be a champion.

8
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:29,118
Roger, do you know what
my father used to say?

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,118
If you believe in yourself,

10
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:32,951
nothing is impossible.

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,200
Hey, Roger, do you
believe in yourself?

12
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:41,200
Roger, I asked you a question.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,450
Do you believe?

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,283
Ah, come here.

15
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:47,076

Hey, come shoot some
hoops with your old man.

I have homework.

74
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,751
I should get home.

75
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,459

76
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,042
Come on, play.

Look, midgets
playing basketball.

79

- [Both] Dwarves, not midgets.

80
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,042
- Why do you even
bother coming here?

81
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,459
- Whale watching,
what do you think?

82
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,709
- What, you think just because
we're dwarves, we can't play?

83
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,393
- Uh huh.

84
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,709

85

three point line.

Hi Levy.

114
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,792

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,709
- Anything interesting
in the mail?

117
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,000
- Yeah, I just got a letter
from my mom from Paris.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,500
Did I ever tell
you I'm from Paris?

119
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,417
Not from Paris, France.

120
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,292
From Paris, Texas.

121
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,292
- I thought I picked up a
hint of a French accent.

122
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,292
(laughing)

123
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:16,792
- It's not a French accent,
it's a Texan accent, Benny.

124
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,342
- Chevy, like the truck.

125
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,083
- Mercy, would you look at
what's coming to greet me.

126
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,250
Tyrone, we're gonna be late
for the basketball game.

127
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,626
- I play basketball, too.

128
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,667
- I'm sure you do.

129
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:32,623
But he plays real basketball.

130
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,394

163

you come in my room?

164
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:27,250
- I thought I'd see about us

165
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,918
going to see Dennis
Rodman on Saturday.

166
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,125
Your principal told me about it.

- No thanks, I've got
better things to do.

168
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:36,584

169

seeing an NBA legend,

170
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:40,083
because you love
basketball so much.

171

You're gonna show 'em
in college, Chris.

172
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,375

basketball scholarship.

173

you didn't get it?

174
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,591
- No, look.

175
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:51,083
What are your plans
for me now, Roger?

176
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,876
You can't even afford
to send me to college.

177
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:56,834
I'm stuck here.

to do about Chris.

182
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,751
I don't know what to say.

183
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:15,999
- He's a teenager.

184
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,459
Remember what we were
like at that age?

185
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,959
You know he loves you.

186
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,834
- He calls me Roger.

187
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:26,167
He doesn't even call me dad.

188
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:39,167
(upbeat dance music)

189
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:59,999
(intense rock music)

190
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:03,999
(light electronic music)

191
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,125
Chevy.

192
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,375
Am I good father?

193
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,375
- Of course you are.

194
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,834
Why do you ask that?

195
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,999
- I don't know.
(phone ringing)

196
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,959
Chris didn't get
the scholarship.

197
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,959
- That's too bad, Rog.

198
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,209
(paper rustling)

199
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,751
- He doesn't look up to me.

200
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,834
- Dude, you have to be on a
ladder for him to do that.

201
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,792
- I think I'm an
embarrassment to him.

202
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,999
(steady instrumental music)

203
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,209
- Rog, do you think
I'm attractive?

204
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,918
- Chevy, I've been
wanting to tell you,

205
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:36,209
I've been in love with
you since kindergarten.

206
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:37,918
- Stop it, I'm serious.

207
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:40,125
Tall girls call me
cute and baby doll.

208
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,292
I don't think they
really like me.

209
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,834
But if I have that operation,

210
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,000
I could be taller.
- No, not that again.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,792
- But I'll be able to
play basketball better,

212
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,626
and she has a thing
for basketball players.

213
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:50,667
- Who's she?

214
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,667
- She's so beautiful
and she's tall.

215
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,000
- Why do you only
date tall women?

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,834
- Because there are more
tall ones than little ones.

217
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,125
- Yeah, but it never
works out for you.

218
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,834
I mean, what's wrong
with dating a dwarf?

219
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:00,918
- 50,000 dollars?

220
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,999
That's a lot of money.

221
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:05,334
- That could be
my son's tuition.

222
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:06,459
- What are you talking about?

223
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,792
- You wanted a chance
to prove yourself.

224
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,083
Well here it is.

225
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,042
- What are you talking about?

226
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:11,667
- All we need is
three more players.

227
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,855
- And where are we gonna
find three tall guys

228
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,213
to play with us?

229
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,083
- We're not.

230
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,709
- What do you mean?

231
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,959
You're not seriously thinking.

232
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:24,792
Whoa.

233
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,999
(spitting)
(upbeat hip hop music)

234
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,667
- You can't be serious.

235
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,709
- I thought you wanted
to take a stand.

236
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,209
- We don't stand a chance.

237
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,959
(metal creaking)

238
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,709
- I think you guys are scared.

239
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,667
- Yeah, of getting
stomped like bugs.

240
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,292
Those guys in Venice play
real basketball, man.

241
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,125
- Real basketball?

242
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,125
And what do we
play, video games?

243
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,584
Who says we can't take them?

244
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:55,792
- I don't know what to say.

245
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,751
- My dad always
told me to believe.

246
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,709
If we believe in ourselves,

247
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,459
nothing's impossible.

248
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:04,950
- Let's play for fun,
like in the old days.

249
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,209
- You know, you realize
the last time we played,

250
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,278
Charles Barkley had hair?

251
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:11,417
(laughing)

252
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,417
- Come on.

253
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,250
Together we can do anything.

254
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,161
At least let's give it a shot.

255
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,876
- Why not?

256
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:20,334
I got nothing else to do.

257
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:23,059
- Okay, I'm in.

258
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,584
- Alright, yeah.
(upbeat music)

259
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:29,083
Oh.

260
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,626
Need some help
down there, player?

261
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,292

that wasn't so bad.

282
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,792
- Are you pulling my leg?

283
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,667
- I think I pulled a muscle.

284
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,083
- So we're not in
championship form.

285
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,250
We just need to practice.
(gentle music)

286
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,209
- Come on, Roger.

287
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,125
We can't do this on our own.

288
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,876
- We need help.

289
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:42,167
- And if we really wanna play,

290
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,417
we need a fifth player.

291
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:46,125
- We need to stand up
and believe in ourselves.

292
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,918
- What we need is a giant.

293
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,375
Someone who knows how to play.

294
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,999
- Why don't you
just call the NBA?

295
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,643
Hello, NBA?

296
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,500
Yeah, this is Roger.

297
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,209
Can you send us a fifth player?

298
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:59,250
(laughing)

299
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,292
(upbeat hip hop music)

300
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:04,167
- Hm, what about a giant
who used to be in the NBA?

301
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,667
- Who?

302
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,751
- You can't be serious.

303
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,834
- And how are we gonna get him?

304
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:11,525
- Money.

305
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:15,792
If you ain't got
money, you got nothing.

306
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,083
No women, no cars.

307
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,042
No good lawyers
when you need one.

308
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,375
(microphone screeching)

309
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:36,209
It's not important
if you win or lose.

(microphone screeching)
(woman whispering)

311
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,375
- Because if you do your best,

312
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,542
you'll always be a winner.

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,999
(microphone screeching)
(woman whispering)

314
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:55,250
- Just follow your
dreams, whatever they are.

315
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,940
(shushing)
(farting)

316
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,799
- Thank you.

317
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:02,500
Thank you again, Mr. Rodman.
(clapping)

318
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,918
Thank you, thank you so much.

319
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,500
- [Dennis] Check please.

320
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,626
- Oh.

321
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:10,959
I almost forgot.

322
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:17,435
Well, it's been a pleasure.

323
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,459
- Now's our chance, let's go.
(upbeat hip hop music)

324
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:26,314
- D.

325
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:27,334
D. Rod.

326
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,755
D. Rod.

327
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:33,541
Yo, D, yo.
- Mr. Rodman.

328
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,667
Mr. Rodman, could we
talk to you for a second?

329
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,626
- Not now.

330
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:39,584
- We just need a minute.

331
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:40,751
- Yeah, we're fans, man.

332
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:41,834
- Big ones?

333
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:42,918
- Yeah, like you said in there,

334
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:43,999
we're trying to
follow our dream.

335
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:46,167
- And what would that be?

336
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,834
- We're gonna form
a basketball team.

337
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:49,918
- What?

338
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,209
Are you serious?

339
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,918
- Yes, we're training every day

340
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:56,334
at the park down the street.

341
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:57,542
- Yeah, we wanna play
in the Venice Beach

342
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:58,500
basketball tournament.

343
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,459
It starts in eight weeks.

344
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,751
- You can help us win
by playing with us.

345
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,228
- Or you could be our coach.

346
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,960
- Am I being Punk'd right now?

347
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,588
Look, time is money.

348
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:06,695
I don't have the time,

349
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,250
and you guys don't look
like you have the money.

350
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,459
So you know what, bye.

351
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:12,189
- Can you at least think
about it, Mr. Rodman?

352
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,167
- Hey, at least we tried.
(gentle music)

353
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,876
I'll see y'all later.

354
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:18,959
- Where are you going?

355
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,542
- Yeah, I'd stay, but
I gotta head home.

356
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:24,000
I got real work to do.

357
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,417
- We're still gonna do
the tournament, right?

358
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:29,250
I'll see you at
practice tomorrow.

359
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,584
Who needs Rodman, anyway?

360
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:49,685
(upbeat hip hop music)

361
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,500
- Chevy?

362
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,334
Why the long face?

363
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:55,918
Something wrong?

364
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,375
- What are you, my shrink?

365
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,167
- Hey, you don't have
to bite my head off.

366
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,626
I was just trying to help.

367
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:03,792
- Sorry, Lorraine.

368
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,250
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

369
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,042
I'm just a little depressed.

370
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,834
- Could've fooled me.

371
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:11,705
Come on, what's the matter?

372
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,209
Talk to Dr. Lorraine.

373
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,083
- I wanna be a
basketball player.

374
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,616
- Are you gonna stop being funny

375
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,209
and tell me what the problem is?

376
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,167
- I wanna play
basketball with Roger,

377
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,250
and my old friend
Nick, and George.

378
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,459
I wanna compete in the Venice
Beach basketball tournament.

379
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:30,667
- That's great.

380
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,626
If that's what you wanna
do, then go for it.

381
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,584
I'm behind you all the way.

382
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,125
- But there's a little problem.

383
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,209
Look at us.

384
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:39,745
- Yeah?

385
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:41,834
- We're dwarves.

386
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,234
- No.

387
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:44,918
Come on.

388
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,334
I've known you for years.

389
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:49,417
And what we are has
never stopped you before.

390
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,834
Look at me.

391
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,959
This is the hottest
diner in Venice Beach.

392
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,959
Do you know how many tall,

393
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,959
boob-alicious blondes
tried out for this job?

394
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,375
And guess who got it.

395
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,959
Me, with my fabulous
personality.

396
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,959
- [Customer] Hey,
what about my fries?

397
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,417
- What about 'em?

398
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,709
- But this is different.

399
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,667
- How?

400
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,292
- Because this is impossible.

401
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,999
- So, what do you want?

402
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,921
- I want people to respect me,

403
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,459
I want people to
like me for who I am,

404
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:19,959
and I wanna win the
basketball tournament.

405
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,218
And I want,

406
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,417
and I want a steady girlfriend.

407
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:25,267
- No.

408
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,667
What do you wanna eat?

409
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,584
- Oh, the usual.

410
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,042
- Coming right up.

411
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:43,334
(upbeat rock music)

412
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,417
- I don't know what
you can do anymore.

413
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,584
You've done it all.

414
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:52,999
You showed up in a wedding
dress at Rockefeller Center.

415
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,792
You go-go danced in a cage.

416
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,876
You dyed your hair
every possible color.

417
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,417
You did way too
many reality shows.

418
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:01,560
You think you can
change your image

419
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:03,292
by making public
appearances at high schools?

420
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,334
Who are you trying to fool?

421
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:06,751
- What are you saying?

422
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:07,959
- You're a freak.

423
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,918
I made you a freak.

424
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:11,083
And you know why?

425
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,999
For the money.

426
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,417
You make money, I make money.

427
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,375
But now there's
no money anymore.

428
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,209
We need to find a gimmick.

429
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,693
- Funny, yesterday a
bunch of dwarves came

430
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:22,709
and asked me to play basketball.

431
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,959
Something, some tournament,
something like that.

432
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,999
You know, they're talking
about following their dreams.

433
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,125
They even asked me to coach 'em.

434
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,459
- We have sunk to a new low.

435
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,876
Wait a minute.

436
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,792
Hold it right there.

437
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:42,083
Do you see the
possibilities, the publicity?

438
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,500
This could be a goldmine.

439
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,167
It's never been done before.

440
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,876
You know what we
can do with this?

441
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:47,834
Think about it.

442
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,466
The great Dennis Rodman,

443
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,747
next to these tiny little,

444
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:53,876
what are they called?
Who cares?

445
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,751
They're just teeny weeny, mini.

446
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:58,247
That's it.

447
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,518
The Minis.

448
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,417
(laughing)

449
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,292
The Minis, it's perfect.

450
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,417
I gotta start making
some phone calls.

451
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,626
Where are they?

452
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:08,584
- Who?

453
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,751
- The Minis.

454
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:10,652
- I don't know.

455
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,083
They said they practice
down in Venice Beach.

456
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,167
- Well then go find them.

457
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,667
You're still here.

458
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,167
Time is money.

459
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,224
Get me my Minis.

460
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:36,959
(upbeat pop music)

461
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,626
- Hey, thanks for
giving me a lift.

462
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:46,709
- I don't mind being
your chauffeur,

463
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:48,792
but when are you gonna
get your own car?

464
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:49,918
- When I'm ready.

465
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:50,876
But if I had that operation,

466
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,000
I wouldn't need the
pedal extension.

467
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,999
- Even with that operation,

468
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,542
you still won't be able
to reach the pedals.

469
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,542
Get over it.

470
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,500
Maybe we should find
three more players.

471
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,209
I think Nick and
George bailed out.

472
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,876
- That's what you think.

473
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,500
- Nick.
- Hey.

474
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,167
- All right.

475
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,709
Looks like we only
need two more players.

476
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:14,643
- Hey, what about me?

477
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,433
- George.
- Hey, George.

478
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,042
- The old team is
back in action.

479
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,209
- [All] Yeah.
(clapping)

480
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:23,792
- Yeah, the old
dinosaurs are back.

481
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:24,626
- Yeah.

482
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,626
You know it.

483
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:28,959
- Hey, what's with the limo?

484
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,042
- Hey Minis.

485
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,626
Are you still looking
for a fifth player?

486
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,000
- Minis?

487
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,999
- Catchy, huh?

488
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,584
Our agent's idea.

489
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,542
- Agent?

490
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,999
- What agent?

491
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:46,083
- I want that proposal on
my desk tomorrow, you hear?

492
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,375
(gentle music)
(phone beeping)

493
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,125
Bob, you're fired.

494
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,974
Yeah?

495
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,209
What does he want?

496
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,417
What, is he nuts?

497
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,375
You tell him to call me.

498
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,542
I'll cut him down to size.

499
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,073
Minis.

500
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,250
Get in here.

501
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,250
Have a seat.

502
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,000
Can I get you anything?

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,334
- Well, actually.

504
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,459
- Okay so you're fine, good.

505
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,667
Now, let's get down to business.

506
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:17,869
Whose idea was it
to put a midget

507
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:19,083
basketball team together?

508
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,209
- [All] Yours.

509
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:21,542
- Not midgets.

510
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:22,908
- Yeah yeah yeah.

511
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,167
Dwarves, midgets, whatever.

512
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:25,323
From now on,

513
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,667
you're the Minis.

514
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,709
Get it?

515
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,209
The Minis.

516
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,751
Sleepy, Dopey, Grumpy, Sneezy.

517
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,500
You might be little, but
I'm gonna make you big.

518
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,125
Big big big big big.

519
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,250
- Well, we're ready
for the challenge,

520
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,959
and we're gonna give you 110%.

521
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,500
- 110%?

522
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,459
That's not enough.

523
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:48,959
From now on, I want 200%.

524
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,530
I want 500%.

525
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,638
I want every inch of you.

526
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,500
Hey, I think I
just made a funny.

527
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,626
(chuckling)

528
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,459
This is the big league.

529
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:03,667
We are here to make
money, lots of money.

530
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,125
- But money isn't
everything, you know.

531
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,083
- Would you shut up?

532
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,834
Let's listen to the man.

533
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,999
(chuckling)

534
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:10,999
(sniffing)

535
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:12,125
- Do you smell that?

536
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,375
(sniffing)

537
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:17,918
- Don't look at me.

538
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,667
- I smell endorsements.

539
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,042
I smell commercials.

540
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:25,463
I smell your own comedy special.

541
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,250
I smell a miniseries.

542
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,643
A Mini miniseries.

543
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,334
- So what about a short film?

544
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:35,584
- There you go.

545
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:37,643
- Who are you?

546
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,602
- Who am I?

547
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,459
I'm your agent.

548
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,167
Okay, time is wasting.

549
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,292
And Dennis?

550
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,459
- And time is money.

551
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,000
- That's what I wanna hear.

552
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,250
I gotta set up photo shoots,

553
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,157
interviews, costumes.

554
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,758
- What about basketball?

555
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:54,125
- What about it?

556
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,334
- Don't we need to practice?

557
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,626
- No problem.

558
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:58,042
Got that covered.

559
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:01,876
- Minis.

610
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:17,999
Chris?

611
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,371
- How many times do
I have to tell you

612
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,125
to knock before you come in?

613
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,209
- I'm sorry, champ.

614
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,250
Hey, I didn't wanna say anything

615
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,542
'cause I didn't wanna jinx it,

616
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,959
but Jack told me today he
has some big things planned.

617
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:33,250
So you know what that means.

618
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,125
We'll have the money
to send you to college.

619
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,999
- Mom already told me.

620
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,834
- That's great, isn't it?

621
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:43,709
- Yeah, I guess all my
dreams have come true now.

622
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,292
- What?

623
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:47,918
What did I say wrong now?

624
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:57,918
(gentle music)

625
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:00,209
- Need a hand?

626
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:01,667
- Oh, I'm fine.

627
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:02,999
Thanks, Chimney.

628
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:07,083
Here, this is for you.

629
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,292
- What's with the
stuffed animal?

630
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,626
- You haven't seen my
place before, have you?

631
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,418
Come on in.

632
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,250
Make yourself at home.

633
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,731
I'm just gonna put these
bags in the kitchen.

634
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:23,213
(cow mooing)

635
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:27,792
Well, what do you
think of the decor?

636
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,753
That's French for decoration.

637
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,417
- So I take it you like cows.

638
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:38,125
So this is what mad
cow disease looks like.

639
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,209
- I was Miss Bovine
a few years ago.

640
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,609
And then, I was runner-up

641
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,550
in the North American
Miss Hosting.

642
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,584
Oh.
(cow mooing)

643
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,209
I could go on and on and on.

644
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:54,310
But, anyway.

645
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:56,292
What did you do today?

646
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,334
- Well, I hung around
with Dennis Rodman.

647
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,667
(cow mooing)

648
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,999
- You were hanging out
with Dennis Rodman?

649
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:05,209
- And we've been
practicing every day.

650
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:08,042
- You put together
a basketball team.

651
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,596
- Yes, and we're gonna play

652
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,096
in the Venice Beach
basketball tournament.

653
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,042
- You and Dennis Rodman?
(cow mooing)

654
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:18,250
- Yeah, we even
have the same agent.

655
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,125
- You and Dennis Rodman
have the same agent?

656
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:25,711
- Yes, and Jack said we're
gonna be big big big.

657
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,284
- Really?

658
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:36,167
Can I get you
something to drink?

659
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,351
- Wow, thanks.

660
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,375
Anything but milk.

661
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,459
(laughing)

662
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:45,107
- You are so funny.

663
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:46,255
You know what?

664
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,042
Why don't I make you a nice,

665
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:53,476
home-style Texan meal?

666
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,976
- Mm.

667
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,000
(upbeat rock music)

668
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:12,334
(siren wailing)

669
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,834
(gentle rock music)

670
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:15,876
- Hey guys.

671
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:17,125
The usual?

672
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,626
- Sounds good.

673
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,918
- Not me.

674
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:22,334
Today, I want my
eggs well scrambled.

675
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:23,999
With some home fries.

676
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,959
No, I want a grilled
chicken salad.

677
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,500
Gotta keep in shape, you know?

678
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,751
- Woo, you're in a good mood.

679
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,417
It's been a while.

680
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,999
How's it going?

681
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:35,626
- We've been practicing 24-7,

682
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,999
and we're getting
better every day.

683
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,334
- Well, that's not why
I'm in a good mood.

684
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:39,500
Do you remember that sexy blonde

685
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,584
that lives in my
apartment building?

686
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:42,709
- She's from Paris.

687
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,542
- Texas, that is.

688
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,584
Well, she almost had
a cow when she heard

689
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,292
I'm playing basketball,
and I'm gonna be a star.

690
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,542
I think she's warming up to me.

691
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,000
- Chevy, does this
Miss Texas like you,

692
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,626
or your newfound fame?

693
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:56,626
- What do I care?

694
00:29:56,626 --> 00:30:00,999
As long as I get the girl.
(cell phone ringing)

695
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:02,422
- Hello?

696
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:03,834
Yeah.

697
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,843
Alright.

698
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:09,417
Sure, we're on our way.

699
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,417
That was Dennis.

700
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,000
Sounds important.

701
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,083
I hope everything's okay.

702
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:21,375
- That gold digger's gonna
crunch your heart like a crouton.

703
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,751
Probably got legs
taller than I am.

704
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:25,667
I hate her.

705
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,626
What?

706
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,999
What are you looking at?

707
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,584
- Hi, I'm Megumi Hosogai,

708
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,266
and we're down here today

709
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,334
at the Venice Beach courts

710
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,042
meeting some very, very
special basketball players.

711
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,125
The Minis.

712
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,584
Well little man, tell
me about your team.

713
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:43,500
- Well there's really
not much to say.

714
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,751
It's just me, Roger,
Nick, and George,

715
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:48,000
and of course, Dennis Rodman.

716
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:50,163
- He wasn't joking.

717
00:30:50,188 --> 00:30:51,999
He's really doing it.

718
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,959
- Let's try to get a
few words from Dennis.

719
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:57,912
Dennis, I know this tournament
is open to everyone,

720
00:30:57,937 --> 00:31:00,023
but don't you find
it a little unfair

721
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:03,292
having an NBA star
playing against amateurs?

722
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,209
- That's not what
this is all about.

723
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,667
This is about showing people,

724
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,584
no matter who you
are, big or small,

725
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:11,351
when you play as a team,
you can do anything,

726
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:14,437
and remember, it's not
important if you win or lose.

727
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,038
If you do your best,

728
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:17,542
you'll always be a winner.

729
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,834
- You're such an
inspiration, Dennis.

730
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,683
- Stop it, will you?

731
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,208
I have a headache.

732
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:26,545
- Get ready, California,

733
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,499
because you're gonna
be hearing a lot more

734
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:29,834
about The Minis.

(laughing)

767
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:15,167
- Roger.

768
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,357
Roger.
- Susan.

769
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,402
- You guys are adorable.

770
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,551
Did you know that The Minis

771
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:24,042
have their own online store?

772
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:26,417
- Must have been
one of Jack's ideas.

773
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,292
- Get over here, come here.

774
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:29,083
You have to take a look.

775
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,626
It's unbelievable.

776
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:32,918
I bought all The
Minis merchandise

777
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,834
that I could get
my little hands on.

778
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,417
- Oh no.
- Oh yes.

779
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,375
Look, T shirts,
(beeping)

780
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,834
backpacks,
basketballs, of course,

781
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:43,372
Mini hoops, action figures.
- Action figures.

782
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:44,751
- Uh huh.
- Life-size?

783
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,417
- No.

784
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,417
But when you put them in water,

785
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,334
they increase in size by 600%.

786
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:50,542
- Not bad.

787
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,542
Do you think it
would work on me?

788
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,542
- Oh silly.

789
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:55,380
There's even gonna
be a video game.

790
00:34:55,404 --> 00:34:56,918
- You know, I could've gotten
all this stuff for free.

791
00:34:56,918 --> 00:34:58,779
- I know, I know.

792
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:00,497
But with all the money
that's coming in.

793
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:01,591
- Speaking of which,

794
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:03,334
Jack just gave me
another check today.

795
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,584
- Oh, what are we gonna
do with all this money?

796
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:07,709
- I'm sure you'll figure it out.

797
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:08,974
- Oh you're darn-tootin'.

798
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:11,161
You just concentrate on winning

799
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:12,417
that tournament in two weeks.

800
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:15,083
- Yeah, but, where's Chris?

801
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,999
- He's doing his
thing at the hospital.

802
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,125
- He's got a thing?

803
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,975
- Mm hmm, volunteering.

804
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,292
- I didn't know that.

805
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,999
- Well how could you, darling?

806
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,709
You're never here anymore.

807
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:31,184
- Susan, I'm doing
this for Chris, for us.

808
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:35,292
- Honey, you can't buy
your son with money.

809
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:38,143
You are a great father.

810
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:40,226
Even before the team
and all of this,

811
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,835
you gave Chris everything
that he wanted.

812
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,482
He's just,

813
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:45,876
growing up.

814
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,500
Our baby isn't a baby anymore.

815
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,334
- Oh.

816
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:56,999
(birds chirping)

817
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,626
- Well.

818
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:08,083
Look who it is.

819
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,576
A celebrity.

820
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,185
Oh, he's ignoring us.

821
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:14,751
Now that his dad knows Rodman,

822
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:17,209
he thinks he's better than us.

823
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,417
Did you hear me?

824
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:23,167
Oh, now Chris is being a snob.

825
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,000
His little father's famous.

826
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,292
Been on all the talk shows.

827
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,959
But he'll always be a loser.

828
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:34,018
Like father, like son.

829
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,125
- Jimmy.

830
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,792
You really get off by making
fun of others, don't you?

831
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:42,542
Does it make you feel like a
man when you insult people?

832
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:45,042
Ooh, Jimmy's so cool.

833
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:49,417
You act so hardcore in front
of all of your friends,

834
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:54,292
but I wanna know what you're
like all alone, one-on-one.

835
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:57,083
Because let me
tell you something.

836
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,500
My father is not a loser.

837
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,167
He wins every single day

838
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:04,417
by putting up with
low-lifes like you.

839
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,876
And so what if he's a dwarf?

840
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:09,513
My father is bigger
than you will ever be.

841

867
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:26,918
And now since I
have a lot of money,

868
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:28,500
I could finally
get that operation.

869
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,334
- What operation?

870
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,167
- To make me taller.

871
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,083
- Say what?

872
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,751
- Let me explain.

873
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:35,375
It's a limb-lengthening process.

874
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:38,106
It's where they pull
apart your bones about

875
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,209
one millimeter per day.

876
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,959
- Well that sounds
pretty serious.

877
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,914
- Everything has a risk.

878
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:44,980
I can't walk for
about four months,

879
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:46,083
maybe some muscle loss.

880
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,500
Could be some nerve damage.

881
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,834
Might be could
make me paralyzed.

882
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:49,876
But that's a small chance.

883
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:50,918
But this is my big chance.

884
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:52,167
After about 10 operations,

885
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,542
I could be this much taller.

886
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,876
- All this for what?

887
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:56,959
A few inches?

888
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,375
- Man, I'll sell my soul
to be as tall as you.

889
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:02,584
I'm sick of people looking
down on me like I'm a freak.

890
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,459
- Look at me.

891
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:06,876
To my eyes, we all freaks.

892
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:08,000
- I know.

893
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,125
When people look
at me, it hurts.

894
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,584
It hurts so much more than
that operation ever could.

895
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,042
- No, you don't
need the operation.

896
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:15,751
You know, you stand taller

Who the hell are you?

926
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:27,812
This is my husband.

927
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:29,190
- We're just dancing.

928
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:30,500
- No, no. No.
- Just a dance.

929
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,956
- No, no.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

930
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,917
- You better get going.

931
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:35,042
Bye.
- Hey.

932
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:36,125
Come on, let's go get a drink.

933
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,375
I need a drink.

934
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:44,584
- You're not having the
greatest time, are you?

935
00:40:44,584 --> 00:40:45,959
- It's not that.

936
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:48,792
- What is it?

937
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,459
You've been so distant.

938
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:51,542
You've been like
this for a while.

939
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,209
Is it the scholarship?

940
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:54,042
I mean, don't worry.

941
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,584
We have more than enough money.

942
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:57,542
- I don't care about that.

943
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,500
- Okay, what do you say tomorrow

944
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
after the tournament,

945
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
we take a trip down
to Northern Heights,

946
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,584
check it out.

947
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:03,667
If you don't like it,

948
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,792
there's plenty of other schools

949
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:05,999
with great basketball teams.
- Basketball,

950
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,709
basketball, basketball.

951
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,876
I don't care about basketball.

952
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:10,999
- Take it easy.

953
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,738
- I don't wanna play basketball.

954
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:13,595
- What do you mean?

955
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,626
That's what you've
always wanted.

956
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:17,083
- No, that is what you
have always wanted.

957
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:18,751
I played basketball because

958
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,334
you wanted me to
play basketball.

959
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:23,584
You never asked me
what I wanted to do.

960
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,334
- Okay, what do you want to do?

961
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,209
- Nevermind.

962
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,209
- Oh come on, Chris.

963
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:35,334
Talk to me, I'm your dad.

964
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:46,859
- I just want to
make people laugh.

965
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:48,918
- That's fine.

966
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:51,114
If you wanna make people
laugh, become a dwarf.

967
00:41:51,138 --> 00:41:52,846
Look at me, I'm tiny.

968
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:55,584
- That's not funny.

969
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:57,284
- Well, come on.

970
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,667
- I've been volunteering
for a while now

971
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,542
at the community center.

972
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:05,209
- Yeah, your mom
told me about that.

973
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:07,125
- And at the hospital.

974
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,375
- That's great.

975
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:12,497
- And I want to be a clown.

976
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:14,459
- Huh?

977
00:42:15,812 --> 00:42:17,729
- I want to be a clown.

978
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:19,459
- Are you serious?

979
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:20,876
- Yes.

980
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,459
- A clown?

981
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:24,167
- And I want to go
to clown school.

982
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,999
- Clown school?

983
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:27,209
- In Paris.

984
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,253
- Oh.

985
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,959
Paris, Texas?

986
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,375
- No, Paris, France.

987
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,751
- Oh, I can't believe this.

988
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:37,918
Did Chevy put you up to this?

989
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:40,643
- No, I'm serious.

990
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,083
- Chris, we have the money.

991
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,876
You can do whatever you want.

992
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:46,042
- Then you weren't
listening to me.

993
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:49,918
Because I just said
I want to be a clown.

994
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:52,334
- Chris, why didn't you
tell me this before?

995
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:54,792
- Because you never asked me.

996
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,834
(upbeat dance music)

997
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,292
- This has been such
an interesting evening.

998
00:43:02,292 --> 00:43:04,417
I met so many people.

999
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:07,334
- After the party at
my place or your place?

1000
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,667
- It's late, you know.

1001
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,751
I have an audition
tomorrow morning.

1002
00:43:10,751 --> 00:43:11,834
And you know what?

1003
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,918
I have a piercing headache.

1004
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:16,375

00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:45,959
Goo goo gaga.

a hemorrhoid commercial.

1038
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:01,834
- But, hemorrhoid.

1039
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:03,626
- Butt, exactly.

1040
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:05,292
You said you wanted
to be noticed.

1041
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:06,985
- By playing basketball.

1042
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:09,417
By showing people we could
do anything if we believe.

1043
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:12,375
Not by being spokespeople
for a diaper commercial.

1044
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,542
- Don't bite the
hand that feeds you.

1045
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:16,626
You're nobody without me.

1046
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:21,834
My father always told
me I'd be nobody.

1047
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,935
But look at me now.

1048
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,626
I got money.

1049

I got power.

1050
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,212
I got fame.

1051
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,975
I got The Minis.

1052
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:35,083
Where'd everybody go?

1053
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,083
- Don't worry, Jack.

1054
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,626
I'll talk to them.

1055
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:41,584
- At least there's one midget

1056
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:42,876
who knows how to play ball.

1057
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:43,667
- Dwarf.

1058
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:44,584
- Whatever.

1059
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:51,542
(people chattering)

1060
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,292
- What are you doing?

1061
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,417
- Are you kidding?

1062
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:01,709
Diapers?

1063
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,584
He's turned us into freaks.

1064
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:04,584
- What's wrong with that?

1065
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:05,584
He's just doing his job.

1066
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:06,626
He made us famous.

1067
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:08,375
Without Jack, we
didn't even exist.

1068
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,542
- Exist?

1069
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:11,125
Are you listening to yourself?

1070
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,999
I can't believe
you're on his side.

1071
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:14,334
- Yeah, you would say that.

1072
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:16,918
You have a family that
loves you, a normal life.

1073
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:17,918
I need this.

1074
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:19,999
Sometimes you need to give
a little to get a little.

1075
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:21,380
Roger.

1076
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:23,834
- I'm through with
all this, Chevy.

1077
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:24,834
Better get back in there.

1078
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:27,417
Organ grinder needs his monkey.

1079
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,167
- I like money just
like everyone else.

1080
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,334
You're going over the
edge Jack, even for you.

1081
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:35,334
- If it wasn't for me,

1082
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,042
these Smurfs
wouldn't be anywhere.

1083
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:39,167
- Do you know that before
the five NBA championship,

1084
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:40,500
I used to work at 7-11?

1085
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,834
And I used to work at
the airport as a janitor?

1086
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:44,358
- So?
- So?

1087
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:45,500
That was the time I
used to play basketball

1088
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,459
for the love of the game.

1089
00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:51,375
I lost it 'til I met Roger,
Nick, George, and Chevy.

1090
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,303
You know, thanks to those guys,

1091
00:46:53,328 --> 00:46:55,023
I understand that
life is more important

1092
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:56,714
than money and fame.

1093
00:46:57,584 --> 00:46:58,584
- Who are you,

1094
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:00,542
and what did you do
with my Dennis Rodman?

1095
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:02,292
- You don't own me.

1096
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:03,667
- You're under contract to me.

1097
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,876
You're all under contract to me.

1098
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:08,834
You're nothing without me.

1099
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:11,125
- You're nothing without us.

1100
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:15,375
(ticking)

1101
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,834
(shaver vibrating)

1102
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:26,834
(upbeat instrumental music)

1103
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:29,417
- Those guys just don't get it.

1104
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,999
I mean, how can anybody
say no to all that money?

1105
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:35,584
You have to milk it
for all its worth.

1106
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:39,792
At least you're still
gonna do it, aren't you?

1107
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,250
- We're not The Minis anymore.

1108
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,999
- Well.
(cow mooing)

1109
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:46,292
What are we gonna do now?

1110
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,125
- What are we gonna do?

1111
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,626
- Of course, silly.

1112
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:53,241
I mean, if you're not a Mini,

1113
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,209
how could things work out
between the two of us?

1114
00:47:57,209 --> 00:48:04,393
(gentle music)

1115
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:07,292
(knocking on door)

1116
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:10,334
- Chevy?

1117
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,209
What are you doing here?

1118
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:13,584
It's late.

1119
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:14,626
Come on in.

1120
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:17,000
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

1121
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:24,250
Saw the billboards.

1122
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,375
You guys are all over the place.

1123
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,125
You must be thrilled.

1124
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,083
Something's wrong.

1125
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:35,482
What happened?

1126
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:44,959
- I got fame.

1127
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:47,584
I got money.

1128
00:48:47,584 --> 00:48:49,459
I got the girl I always wanted.

1129
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,959
But--

1130
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:52,334
- But?

1131
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,626
- But I'm not happy.

1132
00:48:54,626 --> 00:48:58,083
I think she was just
using me for my money.

1133
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,292
- I'm not gonna tell
you I told you so.

1134
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:02,417
But I told you so.

1135
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,404
Don't you understand
that you need someone

1136
00:49:04,428 --> 00:49:06,626
who loves you for who you are?

1137
00:49:06,626 --> 00:49:09,626
And not for what you have.

1138
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:12,792
Oh Chevy, what am I
gonna do with you?

1139
00:49:15,584 --> 00:49:18,542
- I didn't just lose
the girl of my dreams.

1140
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,334
I also lost the team.

1141
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:22,876
I lost my friend, best friend.

1142
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:25,834
I need Roger.

1143
00:49:25,834 --> 00:49:28,667
- Then you know
what you gotta do.

1144
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,018
After leaving a tip.

1145
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,849
- Maybe I was a little hasty?

1146
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:51,000
Did I do the right thing?

1147
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
- Of course you did.

1148
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
- Diapers.

1149
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
We'll give him diapers.

1150
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,250
Make him cry for his ba-ba.

1151
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,292
- We put this team together

1152
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:00,167
to prove that we
could do anything.

1153
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,125
- Yeah, but now what
are we gonna do?

1154
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,584
- You do what you set out to do.

1155
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,584
You play basketball.

1156
00:50:05,584 --> 00:50:08,042
You don't need Jack for that.

1157
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,167
(doorbell ringing)

1158
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,167
I'll get it.

1159
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,167
- But we don't have
a team anymore.

1160
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:25,375
- Roger.

1161
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,918
- Chevy.

1162
00:50:27,918 --> 00:50:30,417
- I know what's important now.

1163
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:32,709
- Apology accepted.

1164
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:33,380
- What?

1165
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,405
I never said I was sorry.

1166
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,555
- Oh come on, man.

1167
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:37,876
- It's cool.

1168
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:39,000
- Thanks, Rog.

1169
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,834
- I feel a hug coming on.

1170
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:42,125
- Come on, guys.

1171
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,125
- [Both] Hug, hug, hug, hug,

1172
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,351
hug, hug, hug.

1173
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,999
(clapping)

1174
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:50,125
- I think I'm gonna cry.

1175
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,417
(doorbell ringing)

1176
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:54,292
That's gotta be the pizza.

1177
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:56,125
- So what are you gonna
do about the game?

1178
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,499
- It's too late in the game

1179
00:50:57,523 --> 00:50:59,440
to find another player.

1180
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:04,959
- What are you doing here?

1181
00:51:04,959 --> 00:51:06,542
- Well let me guess.

1182
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:07,959
You came here to
convince us to come back?

1183
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:09,042
Well we're not coming back.

1184
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,667
- Enough's enough.

1185
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,709
A man's gotta stand up
for what he believes in.

1186
00:51:12,709 --> 00:51:13,959
- Hey, I'm on your side.

1187
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:15,709
- We don't care what
you have to say.

1188
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:16,751
What?

1189
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:18,999
What do you mean?

1190
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:20,083
- I'm on your side.

1191
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,292
We're a team, aren't we?

1192
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,042
I told Jack to hit the road.

1193
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,834
You know what, let's
just roll with it.

1194
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,042
- Can we do it?
(light majestic music)

1195
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,334
- Together, we can do anything.

1196
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:31,209
- You think we can win?

1197
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,876
- I don't know if
this team can win,

1198
00:51:32,876 --> 00:51:33,999
but you know what guys?

1199
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:35,918
You already won me over.

1200
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:37,751
(laughing)

1201
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:41,393
- Yeah, yeah.

1202
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:44,226
- Minis, Minis.

1203
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,959
(cheering and clapping)

1204
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:48,332
- Minis.

1205
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:56,351
(intense electronic music)

1206
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,626
(people cheering)

1207
00:51:57,626 --> 00:51:59,675
- Welcome to the first annual

1208
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,083
Venice Beach
Basketball Tournament.

1209
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:04,206
Today, eight teams will be
competing against each other,

1210
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,964
but only two of
them will qualify

1211
00:52:05,988 --> 00:52:07,292
for tomorrow's final game,

1212
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:10,459
and the chance to
win 50,000 dollars.

1213
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:13,459
Everybody's attention
is focused on The Minis.

1214
00:52:13,459 --> 00:52:15,584
The team made up of
four little people,

1215
00:52:15,584 --> 00:52:18,542
and ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman.

1216
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:19,375

won the first game,

00:53:25,817 --> 00:53:27,984
and thanks to the
incredible Dennis Rodman,

1251
00:53:27,984 --> 00:53:30,234
they now qualify
for the semifinals.

1252
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:32,732
Unfortunately, we saw
a little too little

1253
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:34,756
from our little players.

1254
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:40,067
- I can't believe it.

1255
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,959
- I told you we
can do it, right?

1256
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,417
You gotta believe in the man.

1257
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,417
Have faith.

1258
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:45,918
- But one man did all the work.

1259
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,626
- Wouldn't have won without
Dennis, and you know that.

1260
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:49,667
- So where's the victory?

1261
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:50,959
Dennis played the whole time,

1262
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:52,292
we just stood there and watched.

1263
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:53,542
I mean, I wanna play basketball.

1264
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:55,042
- Relax, Rog.

1265
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:56,876
Don't forget, we're all a team.

1266
00:53:56,876 --> 00:53:57,918
- Nick's right.

1267
00:53:57,918 --> 00:54:00,184
Five fingers make a fist, man.

1268
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,090
- Maybe we need to think small.

Tomorrow, final game,

1295
00:55:35,118 --> 00:55:37,409
The Minis versus
The Venice Vipers.

1296
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:39,325
Reporting live from
Venice Beach courts,

1297
00:55:39,325 --> 00:55:40,909
I'm Megumi Hosogai.

(locker slamming)

1299
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:44,959
- So, how was your flight?

1300
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:45,959
- You're just jealous.

1301
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:46,918
- I'm the one that threw him.

1302
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:47,959
- What?

1303
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:49,334
What are you talking about?

1304
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,021
- I won't take credit
for that basket.

1305
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:53,990
- Ooh, Minis.
- Congratulation.

1306
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,015
- Hey Les.

1307
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:56,500
- Hey honey, are you ready?

1308
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,959
- Gentlemen, it's
been a pleasure.

1309
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,626
- Is my winner ready?

1310
00:56:00,626 --> 00:56:02,326
- Yeah baby.
- Come on.

1311
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,000
- You coming, Nick?

1312
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,876
- Yeah sure, let's go.

1313
00:56:06,876 --> 00:56:08,999
- Have a good one, fellas.

1314
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:13,497
- Tonight, I feel like the
tallest man in the world.

1315
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,500
Who needs that operation?

1316
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,209
- I'm clubbing in
Hollywood tonight.

1317
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,417
I need a wing man.

1318
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:23,064
- Love to, man, but I'm beat.

1319
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,464
- Rest up, baby.

1320
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:26,927
Yeah.

1321
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:28,500
- Hey Dennis.

1322
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:31,542
Chev.

1323
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:32,542
- What are you doing here?

1324
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:34,459
- I wanna go party.

1325
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:36,542
- I don't feel like it.

1326
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:38,459
But I wanna spend time with you.

1327
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:41,959
- There's this really
great party in Hollywood.

1328
00:56:41,959 --> 00:56:44,709
- It's okay, you should go.

1329
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:47,292
- But I need a Mini to get in.

1330
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:48,125
- Oh.

1331
00:56:49,709 --> 00:56:51,042
You should go with Dennis.

1332
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:52,341

1334
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,626

1339
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:10,417

1340
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:11,751
Are you okay?

1341
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:12,667
- I am now.
