[woman screaming]

2
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,718
Get it open!

3
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,015
Please!

4
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:08,216
Please!

5
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:10,520
No!

6
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:11,559
Close it!

7
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:12,753
Aah!

8
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,499
Aah!

9
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:20,035
No!

10
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,968
Come back!

11
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:22,970
Aah!

12
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:26,304
Aah!

13
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:32,574
You're going to dislocate your shoulder.

14
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:34,582
Screw you!

15
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:45,656
You religious or something?

16
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,487
I try.

17
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:00,908
Smoke?

18
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,766
You got a name?

19
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,838
Annie.

20
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,234
Is that a street name?

21
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:34,833
You been in before?

22
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:38,576
Once or twice.

23
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:39,649
For what?

24
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:45,121
Oh, this time, for blocking the federal building,

25
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:46,917
protesting the hydrogen bomb.

26
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:48,456
M-making...

28
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,259
Oh, God.

[vomits]

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,794
Oh, I made a mess of your shoes.

31
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,495
They're as old as I am.

32
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:10,443
I once was lost

33
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:12,378
but now

34
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:13,972
I'm found

35
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:18,520
I was blind

36
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:23,389
but now

37
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:25,393
I see

38
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,191
Who are you?

39
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:35,761
(singing) Amazing

41
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:40,842
how sweet

42
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:43,105
the sound

43
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:47,248
that saved

44
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,444
a wretch

45
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:53,852

00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,119

[workers marching song heard softly]

48
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:09,362
March, march...

49
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:11,303
swing you along

50
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,103

and hope is waking

86
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,868
(women) We won't settle without a fight!

87
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,767
Women's dignity, women's rights!

88
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,840
We won't settle without a fight!

89
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,909
Women's dignity, women's rights!

90
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:22,239
(Officer) All right, that's it. Run them in.

91
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:24,609
Women's dignity, women's rights!

92
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:26,807
Bolshevik bitch!

93
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,178
Uhh!

94
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,216
Women's rights!

95
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,718
We won't settle without a fight!

96
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,878
Hey!

97
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:34,081
Let me give you a hand there.

98
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,589
I'll give you my vote. You come back--

99
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,659
you bastard!

100
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,752
Say, kid, what's your name?

101
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:41,057
Dorothy Day.

102
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,256
everyone calls me Maggie.

103
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,525
Nice to meet you. Stop!

104
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,430
You're under arrest. Ohh!

105
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:47,525
What happened? Can't handle them?

106
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:50,697
Hey, you son of a bitch, get off her!

107
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:51,967
(Maggie) hey!

108
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,975
We're going to get arrested!

109
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,713
Give 'em hell, Maggie!

110
00:05:57,814 --> 00:05:59,111
Aah!

111
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,243
I can't believe it. Do you know
what that means, Maggie?

112
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:04,820
It's so important for women.

113
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:05,945
A breakthrough--

114
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,285
a great breakthrough.

115
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,790
(Boy) Buy the call.

116
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:10,917
Whoo!

117
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:11,925
Thank you, ma'am.

118
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:13,256
It's all here.

119
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,728
Ira, I'm published.

120
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:16,958
Oh, congratulations, Dorothy.

121
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:19,159
I can't believe it- the front page.

122
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:21,362
I think my name looks very nice in print.

123
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,631
Great.

124
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:23,637
Bridey!

125
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,707
Oh, Dorothy.

126
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:27,140
Good morning, gentlemen.

127
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,234
Good article on the front page.

128
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:32,981
Good morning, general. How's it going?

129
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:34,447
Good, thank you.

130
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:39,553
Pull up your skirt, Maggie!

131
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,506
Mike!

132
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:58,505
You published it?

133
00:06:58,608 --> 00:06:59,438
It was a good story.

134
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,203
Oh, Mike! Oh, I love you!

135
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,608
I love you.

136
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:03,872
I love this man.

137
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,538
I'm going to want more than a kiss.

138
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:06,672
Well, you could pay me.

139
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:08,375
Hmm.

140
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:11,352
''Wilson's goons trample women--

141
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:14,389
''suffragettes suffer at the hands of male tyranny,

142
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:16,618
by Dorothy Day.''

143
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,754
I broke my damn shoe.

144
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,397
This is it?

145
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,762
Mike Gold, Floyd Dell--

146
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,699
Maggie Bowen, my new cell mate.

147
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:28,566
She's staying with me now.

148
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,070
So when do I start?

149
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:32,004
One story does not a writer make.

150
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:33,268
You don't even work here?

151
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,809
$2.50 a week,

152
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,402
and your friend Maggie here
has dinner with me tonight.

153
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:40,415
$2.50? Come on, Maggie.
The Match will pay me twice that.

154
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,348
All right, $5 bucks.

155
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:43,612
Great.

156
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,187
Let's get started.

157
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:47,119
The city's condemned an entire tenement block

158
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:48,622
over on the east side.

159
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,192
They're planning on putting up
a new department store,

160
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:51,726
and anyone who's living there

161
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:54,058
is going to get turned out into the street.

162
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:55,721
How about that dinner,

163
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,094
then I'll show you my apartment?

164
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,690
Floyd.

165
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:01,133
Not our kind of story.

166
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:03,205
Why not?

167
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,298
We cover politics, Dorothy.

168
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,535
The reason we have politics

169
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,612
is to rid the world of social injustices.

170
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,009
You busy for dinner?

171
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:12,604
We work together now.

172
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:15,583
Then you're fired.

173
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:18,677
You know where I'll be- celebrating.

174
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:20,915
(singing) Frankie and Johnny
were sweethearts

175
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,652
that's how the old story goes

176
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,819
Frankie done everything for Johnny

177
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:29,023
from his head down to his toes

178
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:31,327
he was her man

179
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,527
but he done her wrong

180
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:35,160
another round.

181
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:38,069
Frankie and Johnny were lovers

182
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,699
oh, lordy, how they could love

183
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,540
swore to be true to each other

184
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:46,672
just as true as the stars above

185
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:48,341
he was her man

186
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,316
na, na, na, na

187
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,880
but he done her wrong

188
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:56,151
(man) Eugene O'Neill--

189
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,090
America's most infamous playwright.

190
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,058
Bohemians,

191
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,322
socialists,

192
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,898
writers, painters, and poets--

193
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,694
all pilgrims

194
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,361
journeying we know not where

195
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,200
in search of we don't know what,

196
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,797
yet all of us seeking to unscrew

197
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:14,877
the inscrutable

198
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:18,175
and to unravel the great mystery of life.

199
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,340
To our newest paragraphist.

200
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,008
(Man) Mm-hmm.

201
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,278
(Man) Hear, hear.

202
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:25,251
(Man) To Greenwich Village,

203
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,949
where middle-class kids like Mike here

204
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,888
come to wear dirty shirts,

205
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:31,187
spit on the floor,

206
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:33,888
to declare their solidarity for the proletariat.

207
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:36,625
The masses are free here--

208
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,634
free from the tyranny of capitalism.

209
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:40,760
Ah, give the...

210
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,270
The masses need food, not manifestos.

211
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:46,536
Any government that puts
meat on the table gets my vote.

212
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:47,541
And if you ask me--

213
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:48,804
who asked you?

214
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:50,344
The world would be a hell of a better place

215
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:51,606
if it were run by women.

216
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:53,147
(Man) Oh, please.

217
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,716
(Woman) Hear, hear.

218
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:56,751
Not another suffragette speech.

219
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:59,185
Give them the damn vote, so they'll shut up.

220
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,186
(Man) Hear, hear.

221
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:01,415
Bravo.

222
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:02,821
Bravo.

223
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,325
Master O'Neill, drunk again, I see.

224
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:09,159
Ah, Moise, the great panderer himself,
in the flesh.

225
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,428
Hmm.

226
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:14,162
Hey.

227
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,567
(Man) Shut up, Floyd.

228
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,196
(Woman) Hey, hey.

229
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:21,474
Where the hell have you been, you bastard?

230
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:23,272
(Man) Guess.

231
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,347
You know what the problem with this country is?

232
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,608
I bet you'll tell us.

233
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:29,207
The problem with this country is all of you.

234
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:30,250
(Man) Oh, here we go.

235
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:32,321
Mike here is a revolutionary,

236
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,582
a believer in free thought,

237
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,351
so he joins the communist party

238
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,016
and they tell him what to think.

239
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,651
James here fancies himself a Bohemian,

240
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:41,753
so he goes and gets married.

241
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,099
And O'Neill,

242
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,499
our tortured artist,

243
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,833
can't write a word until he's stinking drunk.

244
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:52,005
And?

245
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,803
Me?

246
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,310
I'll never give myself to any person,

247
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:57,674
institution,

248
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,407
or school of thought.

249
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:04,476
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lionel Moise--

250
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:06,680
man without purpose,

251
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:08,256
life without meaning.

252
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:10,018
A toast to nothingness.

253
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:13,584
And how does this anchorless soul stay afloat?

254
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:15,493
Not by brain, that much is obvious,

255
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:18,362
nor brawn, which is...

256
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:19,457
Sizable...

257
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:25,031
Although I've never seen him do a lick of work.

258
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:26,768
No, our Lionel here

259
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:29,208
uses that fine jaw,

260
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:30,574
those white teeth,

261
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,908
and those dark eyes

262
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:34,073
to charm the ladies.

263
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:36,151
They fall hopelessly in love with him

264
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:39,153
and slip him money from their pay envelopes.

265
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:40,449
Hey. Hey, let's go.

266
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:42,820
Your siren song sings.

267
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,731
I missed you, too.

268
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:58,304
Good night, ladies.

269
00:11:58,407 --> 00:11:59,237
Cheers.

270
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,503
Who the hell was that?

271
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:03,078
I know Moise.

272
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,612
He's an editor for Hearst.

273
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:07,114
One of the world's great bastards.

274
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,150
One of the world's great rewrite men.

275
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:11,243
I bet that's not all he's great at, hmm?

276
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:12,946
Maggie.

277
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,951
(Dorothy) I'm restless, Gene!

278
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:20,786
I have something to give,

279
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,592
but I don't know what it is...

280
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:23,687
[laughs]

281
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,826
or who I'm supposed to give it to.

282
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:29,769
I know that I want to live fully.

283
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:34,204
I want to do things that no one...

284
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,800
Has ever done before.

285
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:40,874
The transcendent hunger,

286
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,280
the aching void,

287
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:43,818
the itch for the infinite--

288
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,944
forget it.

289
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,646
There's no satisfying it.

290
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:48,815
Eat, drink, make love--

291
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:51,155
that's what it's all about.

292
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,353
I want more.

293
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:55,327
I'll throw in some free poetry.

294
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:56,955
Oh.

295
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,158
Much more.

296
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:06,634
''Life's a tale told by an idiot,
signifying nothing.''

297
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,142
that's not enough for me, Gene.

298
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:10,712
Come on, it's raining!

299
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,373
That's not nearly enough.

300
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:21,615
[Aria playing]

301
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:27,228
[singing along in Italian]

302
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:40,141
Huh. You weren't that good.

303
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:44,078
[sings along in Italian]

304
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:51,210
What's he saying?

305
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:55,282
Her heart is breaking.

306
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:01,791
Someday,

307
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:03,889
you'll learn to love again...

308
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:06,467
Innocent,

309
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:07,831
pure,

310
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:09,165
and worthy.

311
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:10,204
Hmm.

312
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:17,739
Verdi's words, not mine.

313
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:24,680
You remind me of my father--

314
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:27,221
the way you smoke a cigarette...

315
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:30,723
The way you type with 2 fingers.

316
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,954
No commitments- that's what we said.

317
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:35,655
Come on, you're wrinkling my pants.

318
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:36,891
Are you going to punch up my story

319
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,432
on the plight of the immigrant?

320
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:39,432
No.

321
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:40,832
You said you would.
No, I didn't.

322
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:43,701
Yes you did- No, I didn't.
Yes you did- No, I didn't.

323
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:46,775
It must have been before we slept together.

324
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:48,976
During.

325
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:53,505
There's a lot of homeless children

326
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:56,084
all over the lower east side.

327
00:14:57,453 --> 00:15:00,217
If I say yes now, it won't count.

328
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:04,559
Please?

329
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,490
[Aria playing]

330
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:10,963
What's she saying?

331
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,969
I'm reviving.

332
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,936
I feel...

333
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,267
I'm reborn.

334
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:21,132
Once more...

335
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:25,073
I feel my health returning.

336
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:33,012
Say yes.

337
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:39,425
Yes.

338
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:41,291
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

339
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:47,433
(Man) Lionel Moise is a bastard.

340
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:48,696
(Dorothy) I'll tame him.

341
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:49,998
You know that car he drives?

342
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,074
Elizabeth Barton gave it to him,

343
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:53,732
the railroad heiress.

344
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:56,835
two years ago, she stabbed him in it,
out on the island.

345
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:58,709
I've heard these stories before.

346
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:01,749
Moise took the knife away from her,

347
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,944
broke her jaw,

348
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,715
then drove back to the city
with her in the trunk.

349
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:08,255
Would you slow down?

350
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:10,416
Listen, I'll bring him around. Come on.

351
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,084
Where the hell are we going?

352
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:13,525
Oh, no. No. No, Dorothy.

353
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:15,028
Mike.

354
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,598
Mike.

355
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:17,825
Your evictees?

356
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,366
Aren't these the masses you want to help?

357
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,696
Your beloved proletariat?

358
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:23,771
They won't print it.

359
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:25,363
It's a great story.

360
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:30,441
Listen, we could go to jail.

361
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:31,410
Come on.

362
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,348
(Dorothy) A place to sleep! Enough to eat!

363
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,179
A place to sleep! Enough to eat!

364
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:37,183
A place to sleep--

365
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:38,548
Dorothy!

366
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:40,246
Mike!

367
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:41,380
(Crowd) Enough to eat!

368
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,287
A place to sleep! Enough to eat!

369
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:44,825
A place to sleep! Enough to eat!

370
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:47,418
A place to sleep! Enough to eat!

371
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,963
(Child) Mama!

372
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:50,259
I can't get down!

373
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:51,355
Why won't they put it out?

374
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,934
Because they started it.

375
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,593
That way they don't have to evict.

376
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:55,863
Yeah, but they can't do that.

377
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,461
They already have.

378
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:01,406
[explosion]

379
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,738
[explosion]

380
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,972
Oh, God.

381
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:14,211
He didn't print it.

382
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,214
No, he didn't.

383
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:24,498
Three children died in that fire.

384
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:31,937
I didn't make matters better
for those people, I made it worse.

385
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:34,801
You okay?

386
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:43,011
I'm pregnant.

387
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,948
Lionel.

388
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:58,289
What are you going to do?

389
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:03,572
I won't beg the son of a bitch.

390
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:06,832
I won't.

391
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:18,751
(Man) We've got to stand with them and
all the rest of the workers in the world.

392
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:20,219
Eugene Debs?

393
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,354
(Man) We're starting a new world order.

394
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,927
''from each according to his abilities,

395
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:27,586
to each according to his needs.''

396
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,357
(Man) You know nothing of
the lessons of history.

397
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,729
I mean, for you to speak of revolution,
it's absurd.

398
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:34,029
I know the status quo for most
of the world is intolerable.

399
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:35,865
It has to be changed,
by revolution if necessary...

400
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:36,960
Can I talk to you?

401
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,130
And Russia is just the beginning.

402
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,764
What do you know about
the working man, Gold?

403
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,433
You never had a callus in your life.

404
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:43,239
You don't have to be poor
to care about the poor.

405
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:45,040
Yeah, and I'll bet the comrades
will expect you

406
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,478
to forgo your weekly manicures.

407
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,140
No, no, it's written in the manifesto

408
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,741
you're allowed two manicures per month.

409
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:51,751
Forster Batterham.

410
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:52,752
Dorothy Day.

411
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,948
Careful, little brother.

412
00:18:55,057 --> 00:18:57,150
Dorothy's a dangerous woman.

413
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,157
She's a red...

414
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,093
And a radical suffragette.

415
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:03,165
This is a celebration.
Where's the next round?

416
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,425
Celebrating? What for?

417
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,660
The windy city will close the railroad station

418
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:08,464
soon as they get word you're on your way.

419
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:10,436
Someone's going to Chi-Chicago?

420
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,838
Where are the damn drinks?

421
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,172
Who's going?

422
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,772
Lionel's going.

423
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,217
Why?

424
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:26,216
Because Lionel feels like it.

425
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:28,688
You--you can't go to Chicago.

426
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,224
The whiskey is cheap,
the women are easy--

427
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,350
you'll do just fine.

428
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,620
Shut up, Floyd.

429
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,093
You can't go.

430
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:37,563
The company's gotten downright surly.

431
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,100
I think I'll try another drink.

432
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,901
(singing in background)
Got to be true to each other...

433
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,700
Lionel!

434
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:49,778
Lionel!

435
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:54,612
I'm pregnant.

436
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:57,345
We can live as we are,

437
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,421
just please don't leave.

438
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:03,356
Get rid of it.

439
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:15,566
You--you won't leave me?

440
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:19,773
Promise me you'll never leave me.

441
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:41,756
56.

442
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,568
I don't like this.

443
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:53,733
Wait, Dorothy.

444
00:20:53,842 --> 00:20:55,639
No, no.

445
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,143
It'll be fine.

446
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:00,910
Come on.

447
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:01,948
Come on.

448
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:42,584
I'll wait downstairs.

449
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,138
Ohh.

450
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:23,391
(Child) Got you.

451
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:25,831
Ow! Hey!

452
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:26,901
Come on!

453
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:32,941
[child laughs]

454
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,508
(Child) Run over there.

455
00:22:48,957 --> 00:22:50,720
(Dorothy) Aah!

456
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:52,088
Aah!

457
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:53,889
Aah!

458
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:56,294
Oh, God!

459
00:22:57,566 --> 00:22:59,431
Damn you!

460
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:00,763
Damn you!

461
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,633
Aah!

462
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:07,440
Aah!

463
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:25,525
Oh, Dorothy.

464
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:35,100
I can't believe how stupid I was.

465
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:31,424
Hello.

466
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:33,552
It's Forster.

467
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,023
Forster Batterham.

468
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:40,499
We met in Greenwich Village
a couple years ago.

469
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:48,232
My sister Lilly told me you were
living out here, too.

470
00:24:48,343 --> 00:24:50,868
I hoped we might run into each other.

471
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:52,970
Do you like to fish?

472
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:56,779
No.

473
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,944
I do--

474
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:01,253
Cod...

475
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:02,618
Halibut...

476
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:03,622
Clams.

477
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:05,454
I like clams.

478
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,761
I'll bring some next time.

479
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:18,099
[gasp]

480
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:56,901
Batterham!

481
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:02,909
Batterham!

482
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:11,246
Catch any supper?

483
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:13,218
Hey, sure, yeah.

484
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,679
Here, hold this.

485
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,458
Ohh.

486
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:21,392
Ooh, I felt something.

487
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:24,090
Well, flip the drag lever and reelit in.

488
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,166
Whoa!

489
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:28,768
Here, give it to me.

490
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,565
I've got it.

491
00:27:30,672 --> 00:27:31,570
Here.

492
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:32,571
I'm all right.

493
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:33,698
Here, ohh.

494
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:35,299
Oh, God.

495
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:40,513
it's not funny.

496
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:43,106
Yes, it is funny.

497
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:45,652
Whoa, whoa!

498
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:52,556
Come on, you mermaid.

499
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:57,765
Oh, you're such a liar.

500
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:00,027
[laughing]

501
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:01,602
Oh, now, it's true.

502
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:02,601
Uh-huh.

503
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,137
You are a good cook.

504
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,900
Uh-huh, yeah.

505
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:08,271
And you've done wonders with this place.

506
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,742
It's sort of lower depths revival or something.

507
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:11,744
Shut up.

508
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:13,007
[laughs]

509
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:14,446
Ooh...

510
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:19,084
Come here, you missed your mouth.

511
00:28:33,935 --> 00:28:35,562
Excuse me.

512
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:51,817
I'm not ready.

513
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:58,655
I don't know if I ever will be.

514
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:06,163
I don't need anything from you.

515
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:11,566
But whatever we'll have, we'll have.

516
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,673
You be you...

517
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:17,540
And I'll be me.

518
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,137
No pressure.

519
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:23,308
No expectations.

520
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:25,511
Just us.

521
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:29,619
The way we want to be.

522
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:50,071
Whoo-hoo. I'm gonna get you.

523
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,171
No way.

524
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:01,616
Whoa.

525
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:03,088
Feels good.

526
00:30:10,198 --> 00:30:13,099
Ooh...ooh.

527
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,566
Ooh!

528
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:22,709
(lyrics from song playing):
If I'm bold and hold your hand

529
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:25,609
you mustn't scold, please understand

530
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,944
it isn't my fault

531
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:31,348
blame it on the moon

532
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:35,287
if I am gay and steal a kiss

533
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,518
then I'll just say I'm sorry, miss

534
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:40,356
it isn't my fault

535
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:44,057
blame it on the moon

536
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:47,692
if I start talking about a ring

537
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:50,999
or if I mention a plan

538
00:30:51,106 --> 00:30:53,574
don't be frightened or anything

539
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:55,108
'cause I'm just...

540
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,178
[horn honks]

541
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,339
but if you see my point of view

542
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:03,349
then you for me and me for you...

543
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:06,215
(Dorothy) You can't do that.
It's against the rules.

544
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:07,185
(lyrics) well, blame it on the moon

545
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:08,756
(Forster) What rules?

546
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:10,017
Ooh.

547
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:13,424
Ha ha.

548
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:15,086
Whoa, whoa.

549
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:16,163
Watch it!

550
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,331
Sorry.

551
00:31:20,435 --> 00:31:21,834
Are you all right?

552
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:22,961
I'm fine.

553
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:24,538
Come on.

554
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:26,038
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:28,974
Hurry up. Don't let him win.

556
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:31,707
Ta-ta.

557
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:39,518
(Man) And, uh, put them around back.

558
00:31:42,924 --> 00:31:44,653
(Man #2) here?

559
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,421
Hello?

560
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:29,768
Is anybody here?

561
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:33,563
Boo.

562
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:41,438
Oh. Did you win?

563
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:44,575
The bicycle race-did you beat him?

564
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:46,677
Oh, that. I'm sorry.

565
00:32:46,788 --> 00:32:49,120
Oh, no. Don't apologize.

566
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:51,488
Oh, it looked like fun.

567
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:52,992
I should have been watching
where I was going.

568
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:56,291
Mass is every day at 7:00.
It's twice on Sundays.

569
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:58,366
But I'm not Catholic.

570
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:59,728
So? Come anyway.

571
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:04,066
Oh, there was an old man who...
Came in here.

572
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:06,367
Um, beard, long hair?

573
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:09,272
Ah, Lou. Yes, brings us clams.

574
00:33:09,377 --> 00:33:10,810
He lives on the beach.

575
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
Would you like to meet him?

576
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:17,316
(Nun) Lou?

577
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:18,613
This is...

578
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,985
Dorothy. Dorothy Day.

579
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,285
She tells me that you two are neighbors.

580
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:29,955
I'm sorry about the other day.
You startled me.

581
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:47,042
You think this will be enough potatoes?

582
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:48,445
We have a community pot here.

583
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,780
Everybody throws in what they can.

584
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,045
Me, I'm potatoes.

585
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:54,678
Would you like to stay for dinner?

586
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:57,485
No, no, I have to be getting home.

587
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:06,525
You're always welcome.

588
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:23,977
Thank you.

589
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:44,728
How are you able to do all this?

590
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,670
All what?

591
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:50,210
All this. Do you get something for it?

592
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:51,744
Rough hands.

593
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:55,782
Not the oysters. The people.

594
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:58,409
Do you get something from helping them?

595
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,216
Well, they're my friends.

596
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:03,552
I like them very much.

597
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:06,821
Well, you give them so much.

598
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:08,793
We feed some.

599
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,764
Let some sleep down by the boiler
when it gets cold.

600
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:12,764
It's not much.

601
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:14,300
It's more than most.

602
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:16,768
Less than others. I still haven't
seen you in church.

603
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:19,135
Opiate of the masses.

604
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,438
Oh, oh, you are no Marxist.

605
00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:25,513
You belong here.

606
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:29,709
Oh, in church? The shoe doesn't fit.

607
00:35:29,817 --> 00:35:32,843
Your ego's too big.

608
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:34,285
Look who's talking.

609
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:37,256
[laughs]

610
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:38,222
Oh, well...

611
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:45,162
Catch anything?

612
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:47,894
How are you doing? I got it.

613
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:49,697
Good, I'm starving.

614
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,499
Hey, what happened to all the chowder?

615
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:52,937
There's a lot of fish in the ocean.

616
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:53,973
That church?

617
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,216
Gandhi was right. All the world
would be Christian,

618
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:09,449
but Christians are so little like your Christ.

619
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:13,049
Hypocrisy. Morbid escapism.

620
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:15,061
Cowardice in the struggle for justice.

621
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:17,961
That's your church.

622
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:20,466
The poor people in this country--

623
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:22,365
the ones you say you love so much?

624
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,494
They seem to like it.

625
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:25,300
They don't know any better.

626
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:29,240
Look, I heard what Jesus said,
and I say that's great.

627
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:32,142
I see what the church does
and I say no, thanks.

628
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:34,579
Where is Jesus in your church?

629
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:36,650
Right smack in the middle of it.

630
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,981
In the people. In the working class,

631
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:40,714
the immigrants, the poor.

632
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:46,657
God with a human face,
grabbing a hold of us.

633
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:49,252
Ready to fill our emptiness.

634
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:52,763
If my friends found out
I was going to church,

635
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,300
you know what they'd say?

636
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:55,334
What?

637
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,233
Talk about being nailed to a cross.

638
00:36:57,338 --> 00:36:59,101
What am I supposed to do with these?

639
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:03,371
You're a smart woman.
Make up your own mind.

640
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,914
Block after block of fancy town houses-
amid acres and acres of slums.

641
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:14,978
Them that has, gets.
Them that doesn't, gets screwed.

642
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,252
Don't forget the big department stores

643
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,257
and the fancy restaurants.

644
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,851
Yeah, and churches.

645
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:24,727
All kinds of churches.

646
00:37:24,832 --> 00:37:28,324
Protestant churches.

647
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:30,097
Catholic churches.

648
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:34,573
All part of the same rotten system.

649
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:39,340
So, Batterham, you're not, uh,
enamored of religion?

650
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:40,573
[laughter]

651
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:42,513
Hell, no.

652
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:45,108
It sucks all the joy right out of life.

653
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:49,451
So, uh, what do you think of our
Dorothy's growing fascination

654
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:51,991
with the, uh, the mysteries of faith?

655
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:56,154
Forster's an anarchist, an atheist.

656
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:57,424
I've never been religious,

657
00:37:57,532 --> 00:38:00,365
but I feel empty all the same.

658
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:01,901
Needless to say,

659
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:04,904
Forster doesn't approve of
my interest in the church.

660
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:07,372
I believe in what I can see...

661
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:10,444
And in what I can feel... And touch.

662
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:15,780
You can do whatever you want.

663
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:18,647
I have no hold on you.

664
00:38:18,753 --> 00:38:20,721
So...

665
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:24,986
When are you going to make an
honest woman out of our Dorothy here?

666
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:27,653
Who says I'm not honest?

667
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:30,663
What say you, Forster?

668
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:32,756
Ready to take the plunge?

669
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,835
Shut up, Floyd.

670
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:37,302
Take it from someone who knows.

671
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:40,841
But the tyranny of love and all of that.

672
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:42,637
Shut up, Floyd.

673
00:38:42,744 --> 00:38:44,177
Shut up, Floyd.

674
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:47,247
(song lyrics)
when the shadows roll by

675
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:55,319
Forster?

676
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:06,364
Forster!

677
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,298
You leaving?

678
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:10,769
I was trying not to wake you.

679
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:12,840
Where you going?

680
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,101
Into the city.

681
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:18,609
I'm going to miss the ferry.

682
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:21,341
I'll miss you.

683
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:24,714
I'll be back on Friday.

684
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:26,719
You work on your article.

685
00:40:00,788 --> 00:40:03,188
[people calling a greeting]

686
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:24,233
Want some more?

687
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:42,419
You finish your chapter?

688
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,724
I'm working on it.

689
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:50,202
Oh, how beautiful.

690
00:40:50,304 --> 00:40:52,465
It looks like you got company.

691
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,040
Just some friends.

692
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:56,666
I thought you were coming back last night.

693
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:58,244
Nah, I got held up.

694
00:40:58,346 --> 00:41:01,372
Ah, it's good to be back.

695
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:04,516
What?

696
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:10,217
Dorothy?

697
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:17,994
I'm pregnant.

698
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:25,132
I thought God would never
give me another chance.

699
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,173
God?

700
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,368
I want this baby.

701
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:32,571
So who's stopping you?

702
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:40,520
Oh, I love you.

703
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,510
This is silly.

704
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:41,244
You really sneak up on a person,
don't you?

705
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:53,682
(Forster) why are you always
dragging God into everything?

706
00:42:53,794 --> 00:42:54,954
It's that nun, right?

707
00:42:55,062 --> 00:42:56,120
What do you mean?

708
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:00,257
You're just confusing God with biology.

709
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:02,427
It's motherhood you're feeling, honey,

710
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:05,027
not that religious mumbo-jumbo.

711
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:06,834
Forster, all my life I've been drifting.

712
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:09,535
I don't want my baby to drift the way I have.

713
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:12,579
I want her to have something to hang onto,

714
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,205
something that gives her meaning in life.

715
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:17,682
Well, we have a good life. The three of us.

716
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:20,253
Why isn't that enough?

717
00:43:20,354 --> 00:43:23,289
I want to have Tamar baptized.

718
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,052
We owe it to her.

719
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:28,356
Oh, we? Now you sound
just like my mother.

720
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:30,020
Do it for me.

721
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,599
Don't do it for me.

722
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,362
I already violated my instincts
once for a man.

723
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:37,164
I'm not going to do it again.

724
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:40,035
Well, I'm not going to let you
turn me into a hypocrite

725
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:42,632
and a liar.

726
00:43:42,743 --> 00:43:44,506
Forster!

727
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,314
I want you there!

728
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,437
[baby crying]

729
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:22,308
I want to come back.

730
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:27,448
Good. I want you back.

731
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:31,925
We can't be like before.
Things are different now.

732
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,926
You know, I haven't been with anyone else.

733
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:42,059
What more do you want?

734
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:43,727
I want to get married.

735
00:44:45,406 --> 00:44:47,601
That's not me. You know that.

736
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,802
Why does the thought of
responsibility panic you?

737
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:53,106
We had an understanding.

738
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:54,772
I need a commitment.

739
00:44:54,882 --> 00:44:56,110
We need a commitment.

740
00:45:00,321 --> 00:45:04,519
Look, I won't be caged.
Do you hear me?

741
00:45:21,709 --> 00:45:23,836
[speaking Latin]

742
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:29,313
Amen.

743
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,576
[baby crying]

744
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:33,244
Oh, no, no, no, no.

745
00:45:35,156 --> 00:45:36,123
Amen.

746
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,958
Dorothy...

747
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:49,729
[speaking Latin]

748
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:55,569
Amen.

749
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:07,311
[speaking Latin]

750
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:39,585
Come on, mommy.

751
00:46:42,957 --> 00:46:43,787
Tamar!

752
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:46,751
[honk]

753
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:48,590
Tamar!

754
00:46:49,697 --> 00:46:50,925
Tamar!

755
00:47:01,742 --> 00:47:02,936
You can't stay.

756
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:05,102
I got a legal notice of eviction,

757
00:47:05,212 --> 00:47:06,645
and that means that you're out,

758
00:47:06,747 --> 00:47:07,941
and you're out right now.

759
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:09,982
Move along there.

760
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:11,381
You've got to stay close.

761
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:12,543
Why is she crying?

762
00:47:12,653 --> 00:47:13,915
They've been evicted, sweetheart.

763
00:47:14,021 --> 00:47:15,181
They don't have an Uncle John
and Aunt Tesse

764
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:16,449
to stay with like we do.

765
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:18,047
What are you people looking at?
Move along!

766
00:47:22,363 --> 00:47:26,322
Irish, Italian, Polish, Russian,

767
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,060
Jew, Catholic.

768
00:47:29,603 --> 00:47:31,264
No money...

769
00:47:31,372 --> 00:47:33,431
And no food.

770
00:47:35,476 --> 00:47:36,943
No jobs.

771
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:41,037
[speaking German]

772
00:47:45,386 --> 00:47:46,910
Dysentery...

773
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:49,785
Starvation...

774
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,986
Now the flu epidemic.

775
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:58,827
What little city housing there was is full,

776
00:47:58,933 --> 00:47:59,922
so...

777
00:48:00,034 --> 00:48:01,433
They come here.

778
00:48:05,706 --> 00:48:08,937
They are dying here every hour.

779
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:11,637
The public hospitals are jammed.

780
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:14,771
Most are afraid to go, anyway.

781
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:17,316
Few ever come back alive.

782
00:48:25,893 --> 00:48:30,523
Tuberculosis, cholera, syphilis...

783
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:34,192
We don't have enough medicine...

784
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:37,429
And the city doesn't seem to care.

785
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:42,040
[sobbing]

786
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:51,111
Hello.

787
00:48:51,218 --> 00:48:53,243
[speaking Spanish]

788
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:57,250
what did she say?

789
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:58,791
He is dead.

790
00:48:59,893 --> 00:49:01,417
Muerto.

791
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:06,132
Maybe your story will help.

792
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:14,000
Kid died?

793
00:49:14,108 --> 00:49:17,305
Parents didn't have any money...

794
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:20,312
And the hospital wouldn't take them.

795
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:23,042
Came back to try and
make a difference, Mike.

796
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,118
Do something.

797
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:27,517
But now I don't know what.

798
00:49:28,622 --> 00:49:30,852
Don't know what to do.

799
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,620
There's misery, poverty...

800
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:35,661
Where do you start?

801
00:49:35,763 --> 00:49:40,325
I'm going to have to
owe you a dollar, okay?

802
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:41,662
The good Lord provides.

803
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:43,828
The good Lord could care less.

804
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,232
Lord...

805
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:50,742
You got to tell me what you want...

806
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:54,446
What I'm supposed to do.

807
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:59,309
I write, but...

808
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,047
That's not enough.

809
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:04,190
I've got to do.

810
00:50:08,095 --> 00:50:09,187
But what?

811
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:13,832
I don't know.

812
00:50:18,272 --> 00:50:19,864
Please show me how.

813
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:24,371
Please.

814
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:29,709
Hello, mommy.

815
00:50:29,817 --> 00:50:30,681
Hello.

816
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:31,978
Oh, uhh.

817
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:33,110
How was work?

818
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,812
It was busy.

819
00:50:34,922 --> 00:50:36,048
I brought you something.

820
00:50:36,156 --> 00:50:39,592
A book. Thank you.

821
00:50:39,693 --> 00:50:40,717
What's wrong?

822
00:50:40,828 --> 00:50:41,658
Nothing.

823
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:45,696
There's a man--Mr. Maurin.

824
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:47,266
He's come to see you.

825
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:56,667
Hello.

826
00:50:58,479 --> 00:51:00,970
[French accent] You know what is
wrong with the world?

827
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:03,709
The people who act don't think,

828
00:51:03,817 --> 00:51:08,083
and the people who think don't act.

829
00:51:08,188 --> 00:51:10,656
An editor from that magazine Commonwealth

830
00:51:10,757 --> 00:51:12,054
sent him over,

831
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,854
and I invited him to stay for dinner.

832
00:51:13,961 --> 00:51:16,088
And I accept with pleasure.

833
00:51:16,196 --> 00:51:19,063
I am Peter Maurin.
So pleased to meet you.

834
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,997
Let's eat.

835
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:22,591
Ha ha ha...

836
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,578
Ah, merci, madam.

837
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:41,853
[speaking French] ha ha ha...

838
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:45,792
Thank you.

839
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:18,185
We should be announcers,
not denouncers,

840
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:21,591
each one taking less so that
others can have more,

841
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:24,528
each one being a servant of all.

842
00:52:28,302 --> 00:52:29,326
You're welcome.

843
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:31,734
Merci, madam. Merci beaucoup.

844
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:35,597
There is no sin in being rich.

845
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:37,176
There is no sin in being poor.

846
00:52:37,277 --> 00:52:41,509
But there is a great sin in
having more than you need

847
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:44,243
and not sharing with those
who have less than they need.

848
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:46,444
We should not ask the poorer man

849
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:49,454
to do what we can do so
much better ourselves.

850
00:52:49,556 --> 00:52:51,956
The rich have a great deal to give the poor--

851
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:55,495
food, clothing, a warm place to sleep...

852
00:52:55,596 --> 00:52:57,257
Can we eat now, mommy?

853
00:52:57,364 --> 00:52:58,695
Shh. Just a minute.

854
00:52:58,799 --> 00:53:02,565
But the poor also have a
great deal to give the rich.

855
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:05,433
The feeling of needing us,
the secret of joy,

856
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:07,404
the experience of God.

857
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:10,476
Rich and poor need each other.

858
00:53:10,577 --> 00:53:14,013
Getting them together is
the way to build real community.

859
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:15,046
Sound good?

860
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:17,378
We can do it, you and me, no?

861
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:19,850
Uh, Mr. Maurin, we're very hungry.

862
00:53:19,953 --> 00:53:21,648
So perhaps we could start

863
00:53:21,755 --> 00:53:23,052
building community after dinner.

864
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:25,147
But of course. Eat first.

865
00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:27,318
Eat. Then we start.

866
00:53:27,427 --> 00:53:28,587
Ha ha ha ha ha!

867
00:53:28,695 --> 00:53:30,526
I want to leave you with this.

868
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:34,192
We must accept the cup as offered,

869
00:53:34,301 --> 00:53:36,235
not altered.

870
00:53:43,477 --> 00:53:45,035
Dori...

871
00:53:45,145 --> 00:53:46,305
Bedtime.

872
00:53:46,413 --> 00:53:49,211
...the very powerful prayer of Saint Francis...

873
00:53:49,316 --> 00:53:50,305
Mr. Maurin--

874
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,749
which teaches how we must live...

875
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:54,718
That's great. Time for you to go.

876
00:53:54,821 --> 00:53:55,879
Listen...

877
00:53:55,989 --> 00:53:59,186
''Lord, make us instruments of your peace.

878
00:53:59,293 --> 00:54:01,420
Where there is a breath...''

879
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:02,517
great. Okay.

880
00:54:02,629 --> 00:54:04,722
''Where there is injury, pardon...''

881
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:05,763
Thank you for coming.

882
00:54:05,866 --> 00:54:06,764
''Where there is doubt...''

883
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:08,300
it was nice to meet you.

884
00:54:08,402 --> 00:54:10,131
You have a good night. Be safe.

885
00:54:21,982 --> 00:54:23,381
Bonjour.

886
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:25,849
As Saint Francis was praying...

887
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:27,146
''O divine master,

888
00:54:27,254 --> 00:54:29,449
grant that we may not...''

889
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:31,114
[reading]

890
00:54:31,224 --> 00:54:32,384
Mr. Maurin,

891
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:34,187
I would really like to stay and listen to you,

892
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:35,852
but I have to go. I have to get to work.

893
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:37,793
Wait, wait. Here. Dorothy...

894
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:39,456
You can read for yourself.

895
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:41,033
Thank you. Thank you.

896
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:42,123
Oui, madam.

897
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:43,668
I wait.

898
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,738
And embrace poverty,

899
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,704
but seek out poverty.

900
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:53,246
Today, question is how to keep
blessed poverty

901
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:55,178
uppermost in their lives.

902
00:54:55,282 --> 00:54:58,740
The poor man is not him
who has not been loved.

903
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:03,255
The poor man is him who has
loved others more than himself.

904
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:06,121
This is the teaching of Jesus.

905
00:55:06,226 --> 00:55:08,091
Blessed are the poor...

906
00:55:08,195 --> 00:55:10,129
And true poverty.

907
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:14,758
Just ask the church how
we unite the will of the spirit

908
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:16,836
with the work of the flesh.

909
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,632
N'est-ce pas?

910
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:21,105
The monsignor, he is very angry.

911
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,368
I say to you,

912
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:26,310
everyone in this parish is going to die.

913
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:28,643
What is so funny, you laughing?

914
00:55:28,749 --> 00:55:32,310
And the man says, ''Ha. Monsignor,
I am very sorry,

915
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:34,649
but I am not from this parish.''

916
00:55:34,755 --> 00:55:35,722
[laughter]

917
00:55:51,104 --> 00:55:54,267
We don't need to go to Jerusalem
or Rome to find God.

918
00:55:54,374 --> 00:55:58,367
We can always find Him wherever we are.

919
00:55:58,478 --> 00:56:01,879
God is as close as the closest human being...

920
00:56:01,982 --> 00:56:03,973
Especially the poor.

921
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:07,979
Where are you going?

922
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:10,488
You know Jesus had nothing?

923
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,683
The son of a village carpenter.

924
00:56:12,793 --> 00:56:14,590
A poor man...

925
00:56:14,694 --> 00:56:17,595
And he was followed by poor men.

926
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:19,324
Good night.

927
00:56:33,947 --> 00:56:35,312
Did he leave?

928
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:41,847
Um...Dorothy?

929
00:56:41,955 --> 00:56:42,853
Could--

930
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:44,253
could we talk to you?

931
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:45,381
Is there something wrong?

932
00:56:45,492 --> 00:56:47,357
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

933
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:49,929
Um...

934
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:51,759
The baby's due soon,

935
00:56:51,865 --> 00:56:53,423
and, um...

936
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:55,091
With Tamar and you...

937
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:57,568
I--I mean, you're both welcome.

938
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:59,536
In fact, I mean, we're...

939
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:01,539
We're glad to have you.

940
00:57:01,641 --> 00:57:04,474
But, uh...

941
00:57:04,578 --> 00:57:07,604
It's just that Peter, he...

942
00:57:07,714 --> 00:57:09,614
He's here all the time, and...

943
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:15,653
He was a French peasant.

944
00:57:15,755 --> 00:57:17,245
Did you know that?

945
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,393
Christian brother,

946
00:57:21,495 --> 00:57:23,053
teacher...

947
00:57:23,163 --> 00:57:24,790
A homesteader in Canada.

948
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,199
He owns nothing but
the clothes on his back,

949
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:30,735
and he'll eat anything

950
00:57:30,837 --> 00:57:33,635
that you put in front of him.

951
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,574
He doesn't drink and doesn't smoke...

952
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:39,804
And last night, he slept in the park.

953
00:57:39,913 --> 00:57:41,437
Dorothy...

954
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:42,845
Dorothy...

955
00:57:42,949 --> 00:57:45,315
We just don't have enough room.

956
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:48,046
He lives with the poor,

957
00:57:48,154 --> 00:57:49,587
hears their voices.

958
00:57:49,689 --> 00:57:52,658
He knows the things I need to know.

959
00:57:55,095 --> 00:57:57,859
I'm a doer, and Peter's a seer,

960
00:57:57,964 --> 00:58:00,694
and if I'm to do, I need to see.

961
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,791
Peter can help me with that.

962
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:07,235
Now, I know I'm imposing,
and I don't want--

963
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,671
oh, no. No.

964
00:58:11,912 --> 00:58:14,073
My mother used to say...

965
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,184
Be careful, you never know

966
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:22,255
when you may be entertaining an angel.

967
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:26,725
Tesse...thank you.

968
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,961
Can you at least get him
to take a bath?

969
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:35,534
I'll work on that.

970
00:58:38,405 --> 00:58:39,667
Hello, Mrs. Jamison.

971
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:41,741
[speaking foreign language]

972
00:58:41,841 --> 00:58:42,808
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

973
00:58:49,783 --> 00:58:51,250
What's going on?

974
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:52,181
Peter.

975
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:55,787
Peter...

976
00:58:55,889 --> 00:58:58,153
Who are all these people?

977
00:58:58,258 --> 00:58:59,987
They are hungry, they need to eat.

978
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:01,253
All of them?

979
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:02,419
But of course.

980
00:59:02,529 --> 00:59:05,965
It is time for a program of action.

981
00:59:06,066 --> 00:59:08,296
We must organize roundtable discussions

982
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:11,700
for the clarification and
stimulation of thought.

983
00:59:11,805 --> 00:59:14,330
We must create houses of hospitality

984
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:16,602
to feed the hungry, clothe the naked,

985
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,177
and house the homeless.

986
00:59:18,278 --> 00:59:19,836
Well, that's very impressive, Peter,

987
00:59:19,946 --> 00:59:21,743
but how do you plan on
accomplishing all that?

988
00:59:21,848 --> 00:59:24,373
I'm not going to. You are.

989
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:25,576
[music starts]

990
00:59:27,754 --> 00:59:30,279
(singer) my baby don't care for shelter

991
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,756
my baby don't care for clothes

992
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:34,258
my baby just cares

993
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:35,919
for me...

994
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:36,927
where's Peter?

995
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,395
I don't know.

996
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:42,467
Have you eaten yet, sweetheart?

997
00:59:50,677 --> 00:59:52,577
We're going to run out.

998
00:59:56,249 --> 00:59:58,149
Is that going to be enough for you?

999
00:59:58,251 --> 00:59:59,081
Plenty.

1000
00:59:59,185 --> 01:00:00,584
That's my girl.

1001
01:00:04,357 --> 01:00:05,984
Enjoy it.

1002
01:00:32,085 --> 01:00:34,053
From the coast grocery down on Sixth Avenue.

1003
01:00:34,154 --> 01:00:35,985
Looks like cucumber soup tonight.

1004
01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:37,784
It's all they could give me.

1005
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:40,291
There are six people living in a rusting car

1006
01:00:40,393 --> 01:00:41,792
down on 1 2th Avenue.

1007
01:00:41,895 --> 01:00:44,125
It's as if Christ is being crucified all over again.

1008
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:45,288
The poor need a voice.

1009
01:00:45,398 --> 01:00:46,387
Where have you been?

1010
01:00:46,499 --> 01:00:48,364
You should start a newspaper.

1011
01:00:48,468 --> 01:00:50,663
Ha ha! With what?

1012
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,465
When you are doing God's work,

1013
01:00:52,572 --> 01:00:54,836
money is not a prerequisite.

1014
01:00:54,941 --> 01:00:56,636
You just begin to do it.

1015
01:00:56,743 --> 01:00:58,233
Joseph can help you.

1016
01:00:58,344 --> 01:00:59,675
Ever work in a paper, Joe?

1017
01:00:59,779 --> 01:01:00,746
No.

1018
01:01:00,847 --> 01:01:02,246
Well, at least you picked an idea

1019
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:03,508
I know something about.

1020
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:04,947
You can do it.

1021
01:01:08,354 --> 01:01:09,412
For $22 bucks,

1022
01:01:09,522 --> 01:01:12,116
we can get 2,500 copies.

1023
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:15,160
Great! We- we're in business.

1024
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:16,694
Everybody else wanted over $50.

1025
01:01:16,796 --> 01:01:18,320
All right, well, we have $9,

1026
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:21,264
we got $6 from Bob McSorley...

1027
01:01:22,535 --> 01:01:25,129
And $3 from Irvin Nayherne.

1028
01:01:25,238 --> 01:01:28,173
You wouldn't happen to have any money,
would you, Peter?

1029
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:29,400
[chuckles]

1030
01:01:29,509 --> 01:01:32,034
Of course not.

1031
01:01:32,145 --> 01:01:34,136
Well, we're still $1 3 short.

1032
01:01:45,024 --> 01:01:47,652
The rent money?

1033
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:48,989
And the gas...

1034
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,198
And the electric...

1035
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:54,789
Our heavenly Father takes care of
the lilies of the field

1036
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:57,165
and the birds of the air.
He will take care of us.

1037
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,431
And what if the Lord's busy this month?

1038
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:01,734
Are we fools?

1039
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:05,174
Of course. Fools for Christ.

1040
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:07,178
[marchers singing Internationale]

1041
01:02:14,387 --> 01:02:16,787
Read the Catholic Worker. Only a penny.

1042
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,448
They're exploiting child labor.

1043
01:02:18,558 --> 01:02:20,924
Read the Catholic Worker, sir.

1044
01:02:21,027 --> 01:02:22,187
It's all about you.

1045
01:02:22,295 --> 01:02:23,785
Try it!

1046
01:02:29,602 --> 01:02:31,661
Here you go. Thank you very much.

1047
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:33,796
Read the Catholic Worker.
Thank you very much.

1048
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:39,609
Read the Catholic Worker.
It's all about you.

1049
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:41,111
Read the Catholic Worker.

1050
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:42,647
We are here to let you know

1051
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:44,808
that there are men and women

1052
01:02:44,918 --> 01:02:46,283
who are working for you.

1053
01:02:46,386 --> 01:02:48,718
Tell the Cardinal to sell his mansion.

1054
01:02:48,822 --> 01:02:50,380
I'm not just working for your spiritual welfare,

1055
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,048
but for your material welfare as well.

1056
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:55,093
Read the Catholic Worker. We care!

1057
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:56,321
Catholic Worker.

1058
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:57,987
Only one penny.

1059
01:02:58,097 --> 01:03:00,429
Justice, freedom...

1060
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:02,000
Jobs for the poor.

1061
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:07,601
Especially that-- that monster that came up to me.

1062
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:09,538
[stuttering] He must've been 7 feet tall,

1063
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:11,371
and he says, ''wh-who are you?''

1064
01:03:11,477 --> 01:03:15,538
and--and Dorothy looks him right
in the eye and says,

1065
01:03:15,648 --> 01:03:18,515
''I'm a C-Catholic Worker. Wh-who are you?''

1066
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,184
[high voice] ''My name is Bartholomew,''

1067
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:25,120
he says in his high, squeaky voice,

1068
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:27,193
and lumbers off with his tail between his legs.

1069
01:03:27,293 --> 01:03:28,191
[laughter]

1070
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:29,727
Every time you tell that story,

1071
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:30,989
Bartholomew gets a little taller,

1072
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:33,190
and his voice gets a little bit squeakier.

1073
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:34,857
Dorothy, a minute.

1074
01:03:34,968 --> 01:03:37,095
What happened to the rest of my articles?
There is only one here.

1075
01:03:37,203 --> 01:03:39,137
Well, what do you think,
it was all about you?

1076
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:40,399
It would be better.

1077
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:41,666
You think?
Why not, I think!

1078
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:42,934
[knock on door]

1079
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,634
That's probably the landlord.

1080
01:03:44,744 --> 01:03:46,803
Listen, what about this name
the Catholic Worker?

1081
01:03:46,913 --> 01:03:48,881
It makes us sound like we are communists.

1082
01:03:48,982 --> 01:03:50,415
How much money?

1083
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:51,414
92 cents.

1084
01:03:51,517 --> 01:03:52,950
I could hock my typewriter.

1085
01:03:53,052 --> 01:03:53,916
Mommy.

1086
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:58,185
Are you the... Catholic Worker people?

1087
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:00,122
Yes.

1088
01:04:05,265 --> 01:04:06,197
Here's a dollar.

1089
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,544
Could I maybe come back sometime,

1090
01:04:19,646 --> 01:04:21,546
help out in some way?

1091
01:04:22,682 --> 01:04:25,207
I'd, uh, try to stay out of the way.

1092
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:28,185
Sure.

1093
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:30,756
Swell.

1094
01:04:30,857 --> 01:04:31,949
Tomorrow, then.

1095
01:04:36,029 --> 01:04:37,656
Au revoir. Tomorrow.

1096
01:05:48,568 --> 01:05:49,500
Here...

1097
01:05:49,602 --> 01:05:50,796
For you.

1098
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:58,473
What are you going to do for shoes?

1099
01:06:11,657 --> 01:06:15,388
Are you the people where we can stay?

1100
01:06:15,495 --> 01:06:17,656
I'm sorry, we're all filled tonight.

1101
01:06:28,808 --> 01:06:30,332
If you come back tomorrow,

1102
01:06:30,443 --> 01:06:33,139
I'll try to arrange something...

1103
01:06:36,182 --> 01:06:37,376
I'm sorry.

1104
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:43,246
Listen to this one. ''my word,

1105
01:06:44,023 --> 01:06:45,354

down in Scottsboro?''

1108
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:50,185
Well, we're printing
50,000 copies next week.

1109
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:51,729
We must be doing something right.

1110
01:06:51,831 --> 01:06:52,855
Anybody have a smoke?

1111
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:54,523
A priest, no less.

1115
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:00,336
Mm-hmm.

1116
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,464
Socialist psychotics?

1117
01:07:01,574 --> 01:07:03,132
You think he means you or me, Dorothy?

1118
01:07:03,242 --> 01:07:04,140
You, Dan.

1119
01:07:04,243 --> 01:07:05,938
Come on, read a nice one.

1120
01:07:06,045 --> 01:07:08,343
Okay. All right. Uh...

1121
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:11,542
[exaggerated accent] ''go back to
Russia where you belong.''

1122
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:13,141
[laughter]

1123
01:07:14,987 --> 01:07:17,319
Oh, here's one for you, Dorothy.
Okay to read it?

1124
01:07:17,423 --> 01:07:18,822
You will anyway.

1125
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:20,517
''My dearest Dorothy...''

1126
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:21,923
ooh.

1127
01:07:22,028 --> 01:07:23,359
''All my life,

1128
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:26,193
I've dreamt of finding a woman like you.''

1129
01:07:26,299 --> 01:07:28,790
(Woman) Dreamy, ooh...

1130
01:07:28,901 --> 01:07:30,869
''what you write makes so much sense to me.

1131
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,370
''I just don't know whether
to believe it or not.

1132
01:07:33,473 --> 01:07:36,203
''Are you real? Could it be true?

1133
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:37,640
''Could you please write

1134
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:40,507
and let me know the color of your eyes?''

1135
01:07:40,613 --> 01:07:41,511
Ooh!

1136
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:42,740
''brown, I hope.

1137
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:44,544
It's so much easier to trust brown...''

1138
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,981
does anybody have a cigarette?

1139
01:07:46,085 --> 01:07:47,211
Could I see--

1140
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,015
sit down, Mr. Breen.

1141
01:07:49,122 --> 01:07:50,555
Does anyone have a cigarette?

1142
01:07:50,656 --> 01:07:52,123
Here's one, miss.

1143
01:07:52,225 --> 01:07:53,658
Oh. Thank you.

1144
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:55,283
How are you doing today?

1145
01:07:55,394 --> 01:07:56,452
Oh, not so good.

1146
01:07:56,562 --> 01:07:57,927
I'm sorry to hear it.

1147
01:08:02,034 --> 01:08:03,865
Thank you.

1148
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:05,437
I'm glad you came back.

1149
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:06,800
Where's your friend,

1150
01:08:06,906 --> 01:08:09,340
the one that was with you the other night?

1151
01:08:11,644 --> 01:08:13,475
I'm sorry, what?

1152
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:14,477
She's dead.

1153
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:17,105
She's dead? How?

1154
01:08:17,216 --> 01:08:19,946
She froze to death.

1155
01:08:20,052 --> 01:08:21,451
Cold, I guess.

1156
01:08:26,425 --> 01:08:27,323
(Dan) Ha ha ha!

1157
01:08:27,426 --> 01:08:30,054
I don't believe this.

1158
01:08:30,163 --> 01:08:32,654
Scented paper. Who do you think it is?

1159
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:33,993
I don't know.

1160
01:08:35,368 --> 01:08:37,598
That's all we have. How are
we gonna print the paper?

1161
01:08:37,703 --> 01:08:40,069
I know what I'm doing, and I don't have
time to talk about it.

1162
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:42,403
You wouldn't be doing this if
your brother was here.

1163
01:08:42,508 --> 01:08:43,941
Well, he's not here.

1164
01:08:44,043 --> 01:08:46,273
[German accent] Five rooms.

1165
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:48,142
There is no electricity.

1166
01:08:52,051 --> 01:08:53,177
No heat.

1167
01:08:55,755 --> 01:08:58,087
You use the coal stove

1168
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:00,785
and the kerosene lantern.

1169
01:09:00,893 --> 01:09:01,985
Does the roof leak?

1170
01:09:12,872 --> 01:09:14,840
I'll take it.

1171
01:09:14,941 --> 01:09:16,932
$1 8 a month.

1172
01:09:18,844 --> 01:09:21,005
I have $1 2.

1173
01:09:29,722 --> 01:09:32,657
All right! All right!

1174
01:09:32,758 --> 01:09:33,986
Take it.

1175
01:09:39,265 --> 01:09:41,233
$1 2?

1176
01:09:41,334 --> 01:09:42,926
The Lord will provide.

1177
01:09:54,714 --> 01:09:56,705
Good day.

1178
01:09:56,816 --> 01:09:58,283
Good day.

1179
01:10:04,023 --> 01:10:05,684
Dorothy.

1180
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:07,486
Peter, wh-what are you doing?

1181
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:09,584
You don't have to stand in line.

1182
01:10:09,695 --> 01:10:10,719
No, no, no. I wait.

1183
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,263
Have you seen Tamar?

1184
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:14,765
But of course.
She is with the Italian.

1185
01:10:14,867 --> 01:10:16,198
Thank you.

1186
01:10:18,137 --> 01:10:20,196
God bless you.

1187
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:21,466
You're a saint, ma'am.

1188
01:10:21,574 --> 01:10:22,905
Thank you, Miss Day.

1189
01:10:23,009 --> 01:10:24,340
Thank you.

1190
01:10:39,091 --> 01:10:40,183
[knock on door]

1191
01:10:43,162 --> 01:10:44,561
Hi. Is she here, Angela?

1192
01:10:44,664 --> 01:10:46,063
In the bedroom.

1193
01:10:53,706 --> 01:10:55,401
Hello, Lucia.

1194
01:10:55,508 --> 01:10:57,135
Tamar.

1195
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:02,075
It's a beautiful dollhouse.

1196
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,944
It's time for dinner.

1197
01:11:07,386 --> 01:11:09,286
They steal my things.

1198
01:11:09,388 --> 01:11:11,288
I know, sweetheart, uh,

1199
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:12,755
and they shouldn't,

1200
01:11:12,858 --> 01:11:15,486
but they need so much,
it's hard to get mad at them.

1201
01:11:15,594 --> 01:11:17,494
Can I stay for supper, mama?

1202
01:11:17,596 --> 01:11:19,427
Mrs. Matarazzo said I could.

1203
01:11:19,532 --> 01:11:20,931
Tamar, I don't want you imposing.

1204
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:21,931
[speaking Italian]

1205
01:11:22,034 --> 01:11:23,001
There is plenty.

1206
01:11:27,606 --> 01:11:30,131
Thank you, Angela. You're very kind.

1207
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:36,078
I'll be back around 8:00.

1208
01:11:42,388 --> 01:11:43,650
[kids laughing]

1209
01:11:47,126 --> 01:11:49,526
So we're privileged to have with us tonight

1210
01:11:49,628 --> 01:11:51,721
a woman who's brought us
a new understanding

1211
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:54,061
of what Jesus expects from us,

1212
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,532
challenging the opinions of the laity,

1213
01:11:56,635 --> 01:11:58,296
the Priests, the Bishops,

1214
01:11:58,404 --> 01:11:59,530
even the Cardinals.

1215
01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:01,196
[audience laughs]

1216
01:12:01,307 --> 01:12:03,275
A woman who's put us on notice

1217
01:12:03,376 --> 01:12:06,311
that Christianity is not just bake sales,

1218
01:12:06,412 --> 01:12:07,310
Sunday mass,

1219
01:12:07,413 --> 01:12:08,812
and Friday fish.

1220
01:12:08,914 --> 01:12:10,006
[laughter]

1221
01:12:10,116 --> 01:12:11,879
Living proof that the Holy Ghost

1222
01:12:11,984 --> 01:12:13,281
is still alive

1223
01:12:13,386 --> 01:12:14,978
and blowing up a storm in the church.

1224
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:17,021
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

1225
01:12:17,123 --> 01:12:18,385
Dorothy day!

1226
01:12:45,718 --> 01:12:47,208
Comstock...

1227
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:49,844
Is near paradise.

1228
01:12:49,955 --> 01:12:52,446
That's where I'm staying.

1229
01:12:52,558 --> 01:12:53,957
That's where Jesus lives.

1230
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:54,957
Dorothy.

1231
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,992
Frankie?

1232
01:12:56,095 --> 01:12:58,154
The Cardinal's here.

1233
01:12:58,264 --> 01:12:59,253
The Cardinal?

1234
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:01,356
You want me to tell him you're out?

1235
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,298
No, no, no. I'll be right there.

1236
01:13:03,402 --> 01:13:04,801
Um, Eleanor,

1237
01:13:04,904 --> 01:13:07,600
we're going to finish this
conversation later, okay?

1238
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:25,017
Your Eminence.

1239
01:13:27,126 --> 01:13:28,093
I'm sorry.

1240
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:29,752
I didn't know you were coming.

1241
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:31,887
Well, it's quite a place you have here.

1242
01:13:31,997 --> 01:13:33,692
Well, it could use a bit of paint.

1243
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:35,198
Come on, let me show you.

1244
01:13:35,301 --> 01:13:36,461
Well, maybe later.

1245
01:13:36,569 --> 01:13:38,002
Well then, some coffee.

1246
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:39,001
Frankie, coffee?

1247
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:40,002
(Cardinal) please.

1248
01:13:40,105 --> 01:13:41,538
We're determined.

1249
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,631
We'll just have to deal with it,

1250
01:13:43,742 --> 01:13:46,233
bunch of scruffy Catholic radicals like us.

1251
01:13:46,345 --> 01:13:50,406
I, uh, brought all of your mail...

1252
01:13:50,516 --> 01:13:53,041
And most of it's negative.

1253
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:56,212
There's your attack on Franco...

1254
01:13:56,322 --> 01:13:58,415
Your support of the seaman's union...

1255
01:13:58,524 --> 01:14:00,617
Your feeding the strikers' families...

1256
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:02,318
Well, their living conditions are unbelievable.

1257
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:03,588
Their families are starving.

1258
01:14:03,696 --> 01:14:06,324
Their union is run by communists.

1259
01:14:06,432 --> 01:14:09,333
Just because the communists are for it

1260
01:14:09,435 --> 01:14:11,801
doesn't mean we have to be against it.

1261
01:14:11,904 --> 01:14:14,839
Jesus never gave a loyalty test
to the people he fed.

1262
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,202
But in Spain,

1263
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:18,173
the communists are killing nuns and priests.

1264
01:14:18,277 --> 01:14:19,403
They're burning down churches.

1265
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:21,139
Thanks, Frankie.

1266
01:14:26,652 --> 01:14:27,983
Love your enemy.

1267
01:14:28,087 --> 01:14:30,851
Isn't that what Jesus says?

1268
01:14:30,956 --> 01:14:33,015
Do good to those that hurt you,

1269
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:35,025
pray for those who persecute you.

1270
01:14:35,127 --> 01:14:38,528
I know what Jesus said.

1271
01:14:38,631 --> 01:14:40,326
Well, we believe

1272
01:14:40,432 --> 01:14:43,731
that the sermon on the mount
means what it says.

1273
01:14:43,836 --> 01:14:46,737
Violence is not going to solve any problems.

1274
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:48,397
Justice and peace go together.

1275
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:50,372
You can't have one without the other.

1276
01:14:50,476 --> 01:14:53,070
You know, there are people who--

1277
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:55,408
who think that you're a communist infiltrator,

1278
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:59,143
that you've come to destroy the church.

1279
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:01,219
If you feed the poor,

1280
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,753
you're a saint,

1281
01:15:02,855 --> 01:15:05,016
and if you ask why they're poor,

1282
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:06,716
you're a communist.

1283
01:15:08,494 --> 01:15:10,018
Well, we do both here,

1284
01:15:10,129 --> 01:15:12,927
but we're neither saints nor communists.

1285
01:15:13,032 --> 01:15:14,897
But you embarrass the church.

1286
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,195
I'm sorry to hear that.

1287
01:15:17,303 --> 01:15:19,396
I thought we were being church.

1288
01:15:19,505 --> 01:15:21,996
You threaten people.

1289
01:15:22,107 --> 01:15:24,905
See, by your whole way of living.

1290
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,807
Your devotion to the poor

1291
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:29,142
and your insistence on being poor yourself,

1292
01:15:29,248 --> 01:15:31,614
that asks a very...

1293
01:15:31,717 --> 01:15:33,708
Uncomfortable question.

1294
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:35,343
It is not my job

1295
01:15:35,454 --> 01:15:38,355
to tell people how to live their lives.

1296
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:40,425
I'm here to help the people down here

1297
01:15:40,526 --> 01:15:41,493
feel loved by God.

1298
01:15:43,796 --> 01:15:46,321
Now, what would you say to those that think

1299
01:15:46,432 --> 01:15:49,196
that...this is all about ego,

1300
01:15:49,301 --> 01:15:52,862
that you play the great Mother Savior

1301
01:15:52,972 --> 01:15:55,338
the poor have to come to for help.

1302
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:56,874
I would have to say

1303
01:15:56,976 --> 01:15:59,001
that I hope they're wrong.

1304
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:00,578
[clears throat]

1305
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:02,340
All right.

1306
01:16:02,448 --> 01:16:03,608
Now,

1307
01:16:03,716 --> 01:16:05,013
what do you think

1308
01:16:05,117 --> 01:16:07,347
about changing the name of your organization?

1309
01:16:07,453 --> 01:16:09,011
Just take out the word ''Catholic,''

1310
01:16:09,121 --> 01:16:10,554
then I don't have to be blamed

1311
01:16:10,656 --> 01:16:12,055
for what you're doing.

1312
01:16:14,793 --> 01:16:17,159
I'm sorry.

1313
01:16:17,262 --> 01:16:18,889
We are Catholic.

1314
01:16:18,998 --> 01:16:21,330
Well, I'm sorry, but I insist.

1315
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,136
Well, your Eminence, you are...

1316
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:27,671
The head of the archdiocese,

1317
01:16:27,773 --> 01:16:30,264
and we are loyal sons and
daughters of the church.

1318
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:31,308
Good.

1319
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,469
Then just do as I say.

1320
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:36,878
But we are not going to change the name.

1321
01:16:36,982 --> 01:16:38,313
What we will do

1322
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:41,147
is move across the bridge to Brooklyn.

1323
01:16:41,253 --> 01:16:42,686
I'm sure that...

1324
01:16:42,788 --> 01:16:44,483
Bishop Mallory has plenty of people

1325
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:46,285
that he would like to have fed.

1326
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:47,859
You wouldn't.

1327
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,450
I would.

1328
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:00,602
[clears throat]

1329
01:17:00,706 --> 01:17:03,072
they didn't tell us about people like you

1330
01:17:03,175 --> 01:17:04,665
in the seminary.

1331
01:17:09,415 --> 01:17:11,212
Well, you've--ahem,

1332
01:17:11,316 --> 01:17:15,013
you've set a very tough path for yourself.

1333
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,079
Telling us things we don't want to hear.

1334
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:21,591
Loving people who are hardly lovable,

1335
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:22,592
giving...

1336
01:17:22,695 --> 01:17:25,596
And you get nothing back.

1337
01:17:25,698 --> 01:17:27,188
I couldn't do it.

1338
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:30,667
And I just wonder

1339
01:17:30,769 --> 01:17:33,795
how long you'll be able to.

1340
01:17:33,906 --> 01:17:35,806
So...well...

1341
01:17:40,412 --> 01:17:41,344
[shouting]

1342
01:17:43,415 --> 01:17:45,349
Take Homer. I'll take Breen.
Mr. Breen! Mr. Breen!

1343
01:17:46,985 --> 01:17:48,418
First, was the Dagos, then it's the Kikes,

1344
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,112
and now you're letting in the Chinks?

1345
01:17:50,222 --> 01:17:52,281
Mr. Breen, put the cane down!

1346
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:53,688
Aah, damn it!

1347
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:56,556
Mr. Breen, we are here to do as Jesus told us,

1348
01:17:56,662 --> 01:17:58,823
which is to feed the hungry,
clothe the naked,

1349
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:00,922
shelter the homeless and
listen to the lonely.

1350
01:18:01,033 --> 01:18:02,227
And next thing you know,

1351
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:03,892
you'll be letting in the Niggers.

1352
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:06,197
And bury the dead. And if you don't
stop tapping me with that cane,

1353
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:07,363
you're likely to become one of them.

1354
01:18:07,473 --> 01:18:09,839
Now, give me the cane.

1355
01:18:09,942 --> 01:18:11,534
Now!!

1356
01:18:12,644 --> 01:18:13,474
[retching]

1357
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:17,339
Damn it.

1358
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:18,643
Come on, Homer, sit up.

1359
01:18:18,751 --> 01:18:19,775
It's okay. Come on.

1360
01:18:19,885 --> 01:18:21,147
Let go. Come on. Let go.

1361
01:18:21,253 --> 01:18:23,278
Homer, let go! Oh! Oh, my...

1362
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:24,320
[retching]

1363
01:18:26,892 --> 01:18:28,359
Are you all right?

1364
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,620
Yeah.

1365
01:18:29,728 --> 01:18:30,820
Health inspector was here again, but I--I--

1366
01:18:30,929 --> 01:18:32,521
35 violations. I talked him down to 20,

1367
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:34,360
but I think he's really serious this time.

1368
01:18:34,466 --> 01:18:36,263
If we don't do something to
address these problems,

1369
01:18:36,368 --> 01:18:37,562
he's going to evict us.

1370
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:39,330
And he's coming back again on Wednesday.

1371
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:40,871
We'll have to fix what needs to be fixed.

1372
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:43,339
Where do we get the money?

1373
01:18:43,442 --> 01:18:45,307
I don't know. Somewhere.
Maybe we can hock the typewriters.

1374
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,809
And not print the newspaper,

1375
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:48,379
the one valuable thing that
we do around here?

1376
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,378
Dorothy...

1377
01:18:49,481 --> 01:18:50,778
We'll find a way!

1378
01:18:50,883 --> 01:18:52,316
Well, not my typewriter, you won't.

1379
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:53,315
Dorothy!

1380
01:18:53,418 --> 01:18:54,316
Eleanor, please!

1381
01:18:54,419 --> 01:18:56,819
We are trying to talk.

1382
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,218
Eleanor. Eleanor!

1383
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:03,521
I'm sorry!

1384
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:05,392
Eleanor, come back!

1385
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:09,134
Oh! We're all these people have,

1386
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:10,667
but Jesus never said it was going to be easy.

1387
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:12,737
I'm not sure everyone around here
feels that way, Dorothy.

1388
01:19:12,838 --> 01:19:14,396
Well, if you'll excuse me, Frankie,

1389
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:16,371
I have an editorial to finish.

1390
01:19:16,475 --> 01:19:18,466
Hello, Dorothy.

1391
01:19:22,514 --> 01:19:25,449
I read about you in the New York Times.

1392
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:27,280
Made me very proud.

1393
01:19:29,621 --> 01:19:31,486
They tend to exaggerate.

1394
01:19:38,597 --> 01:19:40,258
Here to see Tamar?

1395
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:43,926
And you.

1396
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:47,863
She's at school.

1397
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:51,934
You look good.

1398
01:19:53,612 --> 01:19:55,603
Thanks for lying.

1399
01:19:57,549 --> 01:20:00,484
Never a day goes by that I don't...

1400
01:20:00,586 --> 01:20:02,178
Think about her.

1401
01:20:02,287 --> 01:20:05,188
And you.

1402
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:06,552
You know,

1403
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:09,855
I got me a little place on
the beach in Rockaway.

1404
01:20:09,962 --> 01:20:11,520
It kind of reminds me a bit

1405
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:13,495
of your cottage on Staten Island.

1406
01:20:17,469 --> 01:20:20,131
It's only an hour by train from here.

1407
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:25,936
I didn't think this would be so hard.

1408
01:20:28,113 --> 01:20:29,603
I miss you.

1409
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:39,353
This is...

1410
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:40,652
My phone number

1411
01:20:40,759 --> 01:20:42,317
and some money for the train.

1412
01:20:42,427 --> 01:20:43,325
No, no--

1413
01:20:43,428 --> 01:20:45,896
no, just--just for the weekend.

1414
01:20:45,998 --> 01:20:48,398
Go catch us some supper

1415
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,559
and see how it goes.

1416
01:20:50,669 --> 01:20:52,159
You can bring Tamar.

1417
01:20:52,271 --> 01:20:53,169
[door opens]

1418
01:20:53,272 --> 01:20:54,671
Sister Agnes said it was good.

1419
01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:55,967
I got a star.

1420
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:58,872
She liked the part about
the bear and the robin.

1421
01:21:00,379 --> 01:21:01,311
Oh, um...

1422
01:21:01,413 --> 01:21:03,108
Tamar...

1423
01:21:03,215 --> 01:21:05,410
This is your father.

1424
01:21:05,517 --> 01:21:07,007
Forster.

1425
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:10,486
Say hello.

1426
01:21:10,589 --> 01:21:12,614
[softly] Hello.

1427
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:14,851
Hello.

1428
01:21:18,797 --> 01:21:19,786
Oh.

1429
01:21:19,898 --> 01:21:23,334
A gold star...

1430
01:21:23,435 --> 01:21:26,768
Oh, that's wonderful.

1431
01:21:26,872 --> 01:21:29,272
I never got many of those.

1432
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:33,668
I've asked you and your mom

1433
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:36,407
to come and visit me on Long Island.

1434
01:21:36,515 --> 01:21:37,880
Does that sound good?

1435
01:21:43,522 --> 01:21:44,887
Okay.

1436
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:48,154
Great.

1437
01:21:53,265 --> 01:21:55,859
Why did you wait so long to come?

1438
01:22:12,017 --> 01:22:13,609
I've got to get going.

1439
01:22:26,865 --> 01:22:29,527
Oh, I...

1440
01:22:29,634 --> 01:22:31,192
I brought you this.

1441
01:22:31,303 --> 01:22:32,270
Oh.

1442
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:48,045
So, I'll see you both soon, huh?

1443
01:22:48,153 --> 01:22:49,142
Mm-hmm.

1444
01:22:49,254 --> 01:22:50,346
(Forster) Okay.

1445
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:54,281
Bye.

1446
01:22:57,529 --> 01:22:58,689
Good-bye.

1447
01:23:08,407 --> 01:23:11,570
(Woman) Hey! Hey!

1448
01:23:11,676 --> 01:23:13,735
Hey, let me in!

1449
01:23:13,845 --> 01:23:16,211
I've been trying to tell her we have no beds,

1450
01:23:16,314 --> 01:23:20,683
but she keeps knocking and
yelling your name.

1451
01:23:20,786 --> 01:23:22,083
Why is the door locked?

1452
01:23:22,187 --> 01:23:25,384
We took a vote to lock them at night

1453
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:27,287
after all the beds are filled,

1454
01:23:27,392 --> 01:23:29,383
so we don't get overcrowded.

1455
01:23:29,494 --> 01:23:32,258
Unlock the door, Joe.

1456
01:23:32,364 --> 01:23:33,626
(Woman) Hey!

1457
01:23:33,732 --> 01:23:35,757
Unlock the door!

1458
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,197
Oh!

1459
01:23:42,307 --> 01:23:45,208
Watch that first step. It's a whopper!

1460
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,870
Oh, Maggie.

1461
01:23:47,979 --> 01:23:49,674
Drunk as a skunk.

1462
01:23:54,553 --> 01:23:56,544
(Dorothy) Shh.

1463
01:24:02,427 --> 01:24:03,689
[whispering] I'll be downstairs.

1464
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:04,887
Thanks, Joe.

1465
01:24:12,037 --> 01:24:13,026
Mommy?

1466
01:24:13,138 --> 01:24:14,264
Hmm?

1467
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:27,746
[sighs]

1468
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:29,718
Looks like it's you and me again, kid.

1469
01:24:29,821 --> 01:24:32,153
Are we going to go visit daddy?

1470
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:33,485
I don't know.

1471
01:24:35,393 --> 01:24:36,883
I love you, Tamar.

1472
01:24:45,337 --> 01:24:47,396
You love a lot of people, mama.

1473
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,345
(Dorothy) I love you, Tamar.

1474
01:24:59,718 --> 01:25:01,549
There are many people here that I love,

1475
01:25:01,653 --> 01:25:03,484
and I love you the most,

1476
01:25:03,588 --> 01:25:05,215
and you know that, don't you?

1477
01:25:12,864 --> 01:25:18,063
I know I haven't always given you what you deserve...

1478
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:20,730
But I love you more than all the rest combined.

1479
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:25,204
A million times more.

1480
01:25:27,646 --> 01:25:30,046
Really? A million times more?

1481
01:25:30,148 --> 01:25:32,810
A million, million times more.

1482
01:25:34,052 --> 01:25:35,542
Love you, too, mama.

1483
01:25:37,989 --> 01:25:39,616
[people speaking Italian]

1484
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:15,557
(boy) Hurry up! Mama wants you!

1485
01:26:17,229 --> 01:26:19,288
How are you feeling?

1486
01:26:19,397 --> 01:26:20,489
Awful.

1487
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,561
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

1488
01:26:26,471 --> 01:26:28,564
We thought we would make it all so good,

1489
01:26:28,673 --> 01:26:31,574
and it all turned out to be so bad.

1490
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:34,611
You're going to be okay, Maggie.

1491
01:26:34,713 --> 01:26:38,410
You're going to be okay. Yes, you are.

1492
01:26:38,516 --> 01:26:40,882
You're going to be just fine.

1493
01:26:40,986 --> 01:26:42,044
Okay?

1494
01:26:42,153 --> 01:26:44,781
Wow, what a wonderful day for a picture!

1495
01:26:44,889 --> 01:26:46,720
Everybody stand up, get together.

1496
01:26:46,825 --> 01:26:48,622
Maggie, get in there.

1497
01:26:48,727 --> 01:26:50,422
Oh, Mr. Milias, come on!

1498
01:26:50,528 --> 01:26:51,552
Tony, get in the picture.

1499
01:26:51,663 --> 01:26:52,857
Where's Peter?

1500
01:26:52,964 --> 01:26:53,953
(Joe) Where's Peter?

1501
01:26:54,065 --> 01:26:55,532
Okay, get a little closer together.

1502
01:26:55,634 --> 01:26:56,794
Get your arms around the center.

1503
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:57,799
Come on, Peter!

1504
01:26:57,902 --> 01:26:58,869
Okay, that's it.

1505
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,301
Come on, Peter. There's a picture.

1506
01:27:00,405 --> 01:27:02,202
Come on. Come on. We gotta go.

1507
01:27:02,307 --> 01:27:03,740
Hurry! They want you in it.

1508
01:27:03,842 --> 01:27:05,571
Come on, Peter.

1509
01:27:05,677 --> 01:27:08,942
[applause]

1510
01:27:09,047 --> 01:27:09,945
Yay!

1511
01:27:10,048 --> 01:27:11,208
Yeah!

1512
01:27:11,316 --> 01:27:12,783
That's great.

1513
01:27:12,884 --> 01:27:14,442
Very good. Very good.

1514
01:27:14,552 --> 01:27:16,611
Okay, closer.

1515
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:18,052
Closer!

1516
01:27:18,156 --> 01:27:19,145
Come on. Okay.

1517
01:27:19,257 --> 01:27:21,122
All right, 1 , 2, 3...happy!

1518
01:27:21,226 --> 01:27:22,921
[click]

1519
01:27:23,028 --> 01:27:24,188
Okay, I want to get another one.

1520
01:27:24,296 --> 01:27:25,695
Okay.

1521
01:27:25,797 --> 01:27:27,765
Happy!

1522
01:27:27,866 --> 01:27:29,458
sad!

1523
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:30,465

1524
01:27:30,568 --> 01:27:32,900
Okay!

[applause]

1526
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:38,635
Remember how to do it?

1527
01:27:38,743 --> 01:27:40,870
Remember how to cut a rug?

1528
01:27:40,979 --> 01:27:42,139
Come on.

1529
01:27:42,247 --> 01:27:43,874
I think you still have it in you.

1530
01:27:52,857 --> 01:27:54,950
Try to smile. Just a smile.

1531
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,925
(Frankie) Dorothy!

1532
01:27:57,028 --> 01:27:58,552
Dorothy!

1533
01:27:58,663 --> 01:28:00,722
Dorothy!

1534
01:28:00,832 --> 01:28:02,891
Dorothy! Come on, quick!

1535
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:05,765
What?
It's Eleanor!

1536
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:07,462
What happened?

1537
01:28:07,572 --> 01:28:09,506
[babbling]

1538
01:28:09,607 --> 01:28:12,405
(Homer) I would have helped you.

1539
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:14,410
[sobbing]

1540
01:28:17,782 --> 01:28:20,683
(Frankie) Homer found her!

1541
01:28:20,785 --> 01:28:22,616
She used a straight razor.

1542
01:28:22,721 --> 01:28:23,949
Her wrists.

1543
01:28:25,357 --> 01:28:26,654
Where's Peter?

1544
01:28:26,758 --> 01:28:28,350
I don't know.

1545
01:28:30,662 --> 01:28:31,890
Call the police.

1546
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:45,940
[softly] Holy Mary, mother of God,

1547
01:28:46,044 --> 01:28:48,444
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death, amen.

1548
01:28:48,546 --> 01:28:50,207
Hail, Mary, full of grace,

1549
01:28:50,315 --> 01:28:52,078
the Lord is with thee...

1550
01:28:53,985 --> 01:28:55,213
Dorothy?

1551
01:28:58,089 --> 01:28:59,147
Have the police gone?

1552
01:28:59,257 --> 01:29:00,224
Yes.

1553
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:07,063
I'm going to find Peter.

1554
01:29:07,165 --> 01:29:09,531
Dorothy, you know he hasn't
been the same since the stroke.

1555
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:10,828
I don't care. I need him.

1556
01:29:14,372 --> 01:29:15,464
Peter?

1557
01:29:17,008 --> 01:29:17,940
Peter?

1558
01:29:20,912 --> 01:29:22,140
Peter!

1559
01:29:25,517 --> 01:29:26,484
Peter?

1560
01:29:33,725 --> 01:29:34,817
Peter.

1561
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:37,419
Peter?

1562
01:29:38,696 --> 01:29:42,655
Eleanor's dead. She killed herself.

1563
01:29:42,767 --> 01:29:44,564
I should have done something, but I didn't.

1564
01:29:44,669 --> 01:29:47,137
I--I couldn't. I didn't know what to do.

1565
01:29:49,407 --> 01:29:50,396
Peter?

1566
01:29:52,877 --> 01:29:55,345
Forgive me, I...

1567
01:29:55,447 --> 01:29:58,678
I'm--I'm lost.

1568
01:30:01,753 --> 01:30:04,620
Please forgive me, I am...

1569
01:30:04,722 --> 01:30:07,691
I am--I am so lost.

1570
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:13,696
Oh, Peter...

1571
01:30:13,798 --> 01:30:16,358
What am I going to do now?

1572
01:30:23,741 --> 01:30:25,333
Come on.
Hmm?

1573
01:30:25,443 --> 01:30:26,603
Let me get you home.

1574
01:30:26,711 --> 01:30:28,702
Come on.

1575
01:30:28,813 --> 01:30:29,871
Come on.

1576
01:30:40,191 --> 01:30:41,419
That's right. That's right.

1577
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,463
Come on. Come on.

1578
01:30:55,473 --> 01:30:56,371
(Frankie) Dorothy?

1579
01:30:56,474 --> 01:30:58,135
Yes?

1580
01:30:58,243 --> 01:31:00,711
We're having a meeting,
and we'd like you to come.

1581
01:31:06,518 --> 01:31:07,542
Where's Peter? He should be here.

1582
01:31:07,652 --> 01:31:08,641
(Dan) we already took a vote.

1583
01:31:08,753 --> 01:31:10,550
He wouldn't make a difference anyway.

1584
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:17,150
What did we vote for?

1585
01:31:24,168 --> 01:31:26,898
A woman died here tonight.

1586
01:31:27,005 --> 01:31:28,836
There were three fights last week.

1587
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:30,100
That mental patient--

1588
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,539
we joined the Catholic Worker

1589
01:31:31,643 --> 01:31:34,771
because we wanted to change the world.

1590
01:31:34,879 --> 01:31:38,076
And what are we doing?
We're running a flophouse.

1591
01:31:38,182 --> 01:31:40,946
It's that just we're not equipped
to handle all this, Dorothy.

1592
01:31:41,052 --> 01:31:43,179
And there's never enough money
for the paper.

1593
01:31:43,288 --> 01:31:45,518
It goes to-- to fix toilets or for the heat

1594
01:31:45,623 --> 01:31:47,818
or for some derelict's medical bill

1595
01:31:47,926 --> 01:31:51,384
or for a hundred pounds of potatoes
for the soup line.

1596
01:31:51,496 --> 01:31:55,592
Dorothy, we now have 1 50,000 subscribers.

1597
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,895
We could have a realimpact, change things

1598
01:31:58,002 --> 01:31:59,629
if we could do it right.

1599
01:31:59,737 --> 01:32:05,198
The Catholic Worker is about
people caring for people.

1600
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:07,278
How am I to tell others to love the poor

1601
01:32:07,378 --> 01:32:09,471
if I am not willing to do it myself?

1602
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:11,606
''I... I... mine''!

1603
01:32:13,384 --> 01:32:14,817
We are the Catholic Worker!

1604
01:32:14,919 --> 01:32:16,216
The people in this room!

1605
01:32:16,321 --> 01:32:18,016
We are what makes it work, not just you!

1606
01:32:18,122 --> 01:32:23,424
We're tired of your dictates,
your arrogance, your ego!

1607
01:32:23,528 --> 01:32:25,928
My God, your own daughter
doesn't even have a bed to sleep in--

1608
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:26,928
you leave Tamar out of this!

1609
01:32:27,031 --> 01:32:28,362
No! It's enough!

1610
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:35,698
We're not going to do it anymore.

1611
01:32:35,807 --> 01:32:37,399
We're not.

1612
01:32:37,508 --> 01:32:39,703
No more drunks...

1613
01:32:39,811 --> 01:32:40,971
No more bedbugs...

1614
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:43,343
No more fistfights...

1615
01:32:43,448 --> 01:32:45,006
No more prostitutes...

1616
01:32:45,116 --> 01:32:49,075
And no more mental patients.

1617
01:32:49,187 --> 01:32:50,552
We're not going to do it anymore.

1618
01:32:57,662 --> 01:33:00,028
Is that how you all feel?

1619
01:33:02,634 --> 01:33:05,296
It was unanimous.

1620
01:33:05,403 --> 01:33:08,031
Frankie?

1621
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,674
And you, Joe?

1622
01:33:28,092 --> 01:33:30,083

1624
01:33:33,665 --> 01:33:35,155
Where are you?

1625
01:33:39,337 --> 01:33:41,498
Why don't you answer me?

1626
01:33:46,878 --> 01:33:48,505
I need you!

1627
01:33:53,685 --> 01:33:56,984
These brothers and sisters of yours,

1628
01:33:57,088 --> 01:34:01,081
the ones you want me to love...

1629
01:34:01,192 --> 01:34:04,923
Let me tell you something...

1630
01:34:05,029 --> 01:34:07,497
They smell...

1631
01:34:07,598 --> 01:34:12,228
They have lice and tuberculosis.

1632

[thunder]

1633
01:34:15,373 --> 01:34:17,773
Am I to find you in them?

1634
01:34:21,412 --> 01:34:25,405
Well, you're ugly...

1635
01:34:25,516 --> 01:34:26,949
You drink...

1636
01:34:27,051 --> 01:34:30,077
And you wet your pants...

1637
01:34:30,188 --> 01:34:31,815
And you vomit.

1638
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:39,091
How could anyone ever love you?

1639
01:34:49,974 --> 01:34:52,101
I need you...

1640
01:34:55,747 --> 01:34:57,408
But you're not here.

1641
01:35:01,285 --> 01:35:03,947
You've deserted me, too...

1642
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:07,621
Haven't you?

1644
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:27,908
I'm not who you thought I was.

1645
01:35:31,082 --> 01:35:32,413
I'm sorry.

1647
01:36:12,957 --> 01:36:15,050
Dorothy...

1648
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:17,423
You look awful.

1649
01:36:22,166 --> 01:36:26,102
I wanted to change the world, Mike.

1650
01:36:26,204 --> 01:36:29,230
I haven't changed a thing.

1651
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,107
All those young idealistic people
who came to help...

1652
01:36:34,212 --> 01:36:40,208
Full of hope and promise...

1653
01:36:40,318 --> 01:36:44,550
I've made them hard...

1654
01:36:44,655 --> 01:36:46,145
Cynical.

1655
01:36:48,192 --> 01:36:49,784
A young girl killed herself today

1656
01:36:49,894 --> 01:36:51,759
in the bathroom at Mott Street.

1657
01:36:54,632 --> 01:36:56,099
We weren't equipped.

1658
01:37:03,274 --> 01:37:05,037
We can't do it, Mike.

1659
01:37:09,881 --> 01:37:11,280
I'm empty.

1660
01:37:12,817 --> 01:37:14,546
I'm given out.

1661
01:37:16,854 --> 01:37:19,152
I have nothing left to give.

1662
01:37:23,594 --> 01:37:26,654
We communists talk about helping the poor,

1663
01:37:26,764 --> 01:37:29,392
but you've done it.

1664
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,960
How many do you feed
now every day, 3,000?

1665
01:37:34,071 --> 01:37:37,097
How many do you sleep?

1666
01:37:37,208 --> 01:37:39,699
You may not have changed the world,

1667
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:43,678
but you made it a little more bearable

1668
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:47,512
for those that hurt the most.

1669
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:50,746
Not bad...

1670
01:37:50,855 --> 01:37:52,083
For a Catholic.

1671
01:37:59,964 --> 01:38:03,832
I don't want to spend the rest of
my life cleaning toilets, Mike.

1672
01:38:07,338 --> 01:38:08,828
I can't.

1673
01:38:13,844 --> 01:38:15,709
My daughter needs a father.

1674
01:38:18,849 --> 01:38:20,441
I need a job.

1675
01:38:26,424 --> 01:38:29,086
Do you know anyone who needs a reporter?

1676
01:38:39,437 --> 01:38:41,428
[thunder]

1677
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:22,076
Is anyone here?

1678
01:39:31,856 --> 01:39:32,788
Who's there?

1679
01:39:35,693 --> 01:39:36,717
Unh!

1680
01:39:36,827 --> 01:39:37,725
Maggie!

1681
01:39:37,828 --> 01:39:38,954
Maggie, stop!

1682
01:39:39,063 --> 01:39:40,360
Maggie, why are you doing this?

1683
01:39:40,464 --> 01:39:42,432
Why do you think I'm doing this?
I need a drink!

1684
01:39:42,533 --> 01:39:43,693
Aah!

1685
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:45,792
A drink isn't going to give you
what you want!

1686
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:46,927
Get out of my way!

1687
01:39:47,038 --> 01:39:48,437
Give me the money, Maggie.

1688
01:39:48,539 --> 01:39:49,563
No. I need it.

1689
01:39:49,673 --> 01:39:50,640
I said, give it to me!

1690
01:39:52,676 --> 01:39:54,541
The great Dorothy Day

1691
01:39:54,645 --> 01:39:55,543
with her picture in the paper,

1692
01:39:55,646 --> 01:39:57,511
and we're all so horrible!

1693
01:39:57,615 --> 01:39:59,242
Drunks! Addicts! Whores!

1694
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:01,716
That's right, isn't it?

1695
01:40:01,819 --> 01:40:02,808
Give me the money.

1696
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,512
I hate you!

1697
01:40:04,622 --> 01:40:06,715
Let me out of here! I hate you!

1698
01:40:06,824 --> 01:40:08,883
Aah!

1699
01:40:08,993 --> 01:40:11,427
I hate you! I hate you!

1700
01:40:12,797 --> 01:40:14,890
Aah!

1701
01:40:14,999 --> 01:40:16,762
Aah!

1702
01:40:17,902 --> 01:40:20,894
Go ahead! Go on! Hit me!

1703
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:24,702
I'm a slut, I'm a drunk, I'm a thief.

1704
01:40:24,809 --> 01:40:27,778
Go on! Go ahead! Hit me!

1705
01:40:27,878 --> 01:40:29,709
Hit me! Hit me!

1706
01:40:31,749 --> 01:40:32,977
Go on!

1707
01:40:35,019 --> 01:40:37,146
I can see the light in you.

1708
01:40:37,254 --> 01:40:38,619
You can't!

1709
01:40:41,058 --> 01:40:43,151
The courage and the love.

1710
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,696
Stop saying that.

1711
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:48,389
You're very beautiful.

1712
01:40:48,499 --> 01:40:50,626
I'm not!

1713
01:40:52,837 --> 01:40:53,769
Dorothy?

1714
01:40:57,174 --> 01:40:58,072
I love you.

1715
01:40:58,175 --> 01:41:00,666
You can't.

1716
01:41:00,778 --> 01:41:02,109
I stole from you.

1717
01:41:03,647 --> 01:41:07,014
The only person who ever really
cared about me.

1718
01:41:09,086 --> 01:41:11,816
Shh...

1719
01:41:11,922 --> 01:41:13,651
(Dorothy) We all love you, Maggie.

1720
01:41:15,493 --> 01:41:16,517
We do.

1721
01:41:16,627 --> 01:41:18,026
(Maggie) You can't!

1722
01:41:18,129 --> 01:41:20,256
(Dorothy) Shh.

1723
01:41:20,364 --> 01:41:22,229
It's okay. We all love you.

1724
01:41:25,336 --> 01:41:27,770
Come on, let me get you upstairs.

1725
01:41:33,277 --> 01:41:36,246
Get you cleaned up, something to eat.

1726
01:41:52,463 --> 01:41:53,623
I've been doing a lot of thinking

1727
01:41:53,731 --> 01:41:55,756
about what you said earlier tonight.

1728
01:41:57,668 --> 01:42:00,364
And you're right.

1729
01:42:00,471 --> 01:42:02,837
I've been arrogant...

1730
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:05,738
And self-righteous.

1731
01:42:05,843 --> 01:42:08,573
I was intent on doing everything myself

1732
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:12,445
instead of letting God work through me...

1733
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:15,417
Through us...

1734
01:42:15,519 --> 01:42:17,146
And I'm sorry for all that.

1735
01:42:21,058 --> 01:42:23,151
I've also been doing a lot of thinking

1736
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:26,627
about what it is that God wants me to do.

1737
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:34,270
It's been a very lonely life, and...

1738
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:36,635
I've been looking to fill the emptiness.

1739
01:42:39,777 --> 01:42:45,841
Now I see it begins with these people.

1740
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:49,716
The ones that nobody else wants.

1741
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:54,450
The ones that hurt and are angry

1742
01:42:54,558 --> 01:42:56,685
and have nothing left to give.

1743
01:42:59,997 --> 01:43:02,431
They are my meeting place with God.

1744
01:43:05,302 --> 01:43:06,826
And if I would just give them a chance,

1745
01:43:06,937 --> 01:43:10,668
I know God will fill me with love.

1746
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:12,366
Fill me through these people.

1747
01:43:15,379 --> 01:43:19,406
Now, I-- I hope I don't have to
do it alone.

1748
01:43:21,986 --> 01:43:24,011
I hope some of you can stay.

1749
01:43:26,323 --> 01:43:28,416
But if you choose to leave,

1750
01:43:28,525 --> 01:43:32,086
I can...

1751
01:43:32,196 --> 01:43:33,959
I will understand.

1752
01:43:38,168 --> 01:43:40,102
Dan...

1753
01:43:40,204 --> 01:43:42,866
The paper is never going to be

1754
01:43:42,973 --> 01:43:47,467
what you or I want it to be.

1755
01:43:47,578 --> 01:43:52,106
But I don't think that God will judge us

1756
01:43:52,216 --> 01:43:55,151
on how successful we are at
changing the world.

1757
01:43:57,221 --> 01:43:59,849
I do think he will judge us

1758
01:43:59,957 --> 01:44:04,155
on how faithful we are
in serving His poor.

1759
01:44:06,196 --> 01:44:09,165
I have a few dollars here from a friend of mine.

1760
01:44:11,769 --> 01:44:14,033
You can use that for the next issue.

1761
01:44:17,574 --> 01:44:20,907
Now, I will not think less of anyone who chooses to
go.

1762
01:44:23,614 --> 01:44:26,640
I am very, very grateful

1763
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:32,655
for everything that you have done...

1764
01:44:32,756 --> 01:44:34,348
And I love you.

1765
01:44:37,895 --> 01:44:39,886
May the Lord be with you.

1766
01:44:48,906 --> 01:44:50,237
Come on, Mama.

1767
01:44:57,748 --> 01:44:59,443
[opera playing]

1768
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:15,496
How many are left, Peter?

1769
01:45:15,599 --> 01:45:17,999
A single one?

1770
01:45:18,102 --> 01:45:20,036
Or are we left to preparing breakfast

1771
01:45:20,137 --> 01:45:22,298
for ourselves like in the beginning?

1772
01:45:24,908 --> 01:45:26,899
That would be fun again, wouldn't it?

1773
01:45:35,386 --> 01:45:36,353
Come on.

1774
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:51,061
(Woman) Morning, Miss Day.

1775
01:45:55,939 --> 01:45:57,133
(Sister) Morning, Dorothy.

1776
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:00,875
Morning to you, Miss Day.

1777
01:46:11,855 --> 01:46:13,254
Morning, Miss Day.

1778
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:22,130
Hi.

1779
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,198
We need your column, Dorothy.

1780
01:46:31,308 --> 01:46:33,868
It's already a day late.

1781
01:46:47,825 --> 01:46:49,315
Thank you.

1782
01:47:11,748 --> 01:47:17,846
(singing) Amazing grace

1783
01:47:17,955 --> 01:47:24,190
how sweet the sound

1784
01:47:24,294 --> 01:47:30,130
that saved a wretch

1785
01:47:30,234 --> 01:47:34,466
like me

1786
01:47:34,571 --> 01:47:36,471
[humming]

1787
01:47:59,162 --> 01:48:03,826
amazing grace

1788
01:48:03,934 --> 01:48:09,372
how sweet the sound

1789
01:48:09,473 --> 01:48:13,705
that saved a wretch

1790
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:17,644
like me

1791
01:48:17,748 --> 01:48:22,617
I once was lost

1792
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:27,656
but now am found

1793
01:48:27,758 --> 01:48:29,589
was blind

1794
01:48:29,693 --> 01:48:35,188
but now I see
