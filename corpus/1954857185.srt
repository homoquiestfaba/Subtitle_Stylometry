1
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,779
<i>Here we are in the 12th
and final round.</i>

2
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,781
<i>It's been a brutal fight
between xao</i>

3
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:41,534
<i>and the world champion
chance o'brien.</i>

4
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,121
<i>They're having a chance to fight</i>

5
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:47,372
<i>with one another
that has escalated</i>

6
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>this battle into a war.</i>

7
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,585
<i>Xao has cyber enhancements</i>

8
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:54,005
<i>that seem to give him the
strength to stay with o'brien,</i>

9
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:58,383
<i>who is one of the few 100%
human fighters still competing.</i>

10
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:01,512
<i>O'brien has the speed,
power and skill</i>

11
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:03,889
<i>well beyond any current fighter
of any grade,</i>

12
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,934
<i>cyber-enhanced or human.</i>

13
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:28,164
<i>Down! Down! This could be it!</i>

14
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,958
<i>The electronic timer
counts away the seconds!</i>

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,836
<i>Eight, nine, 10!</i>

16
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:36,881
<i>Chance o'brien
has reclaimed his championship</i>

17
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:39,008
<i>with a stunning
twelfth-round knockout</i>

18
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,427
<i>of previously unbeaten xao.</i>

19
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,847
<i>O'brien's unorthodox manager,</i>

20
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:48,475
<i>Jo, has leaped into the ring
to congratulate her fighter.</i>

21
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,103
<i>What will the rematch be like?</i>

22
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:15,617
<i>It is a crucial time
for our company.</i>

23
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,995
<i>Competition
with other corporations</i>

24
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:20,248
<i>is disrupting our market share.</i>

25
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:28,380
<i>We have gone from 53% to 39%
in two years.</i>

26
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:32,259
<i>The zikan corporation alone</i>

27
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,679
<i>has penetrated 10%
into our coverage</i>

28
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,057
<i>in the last eight months.</i>

29
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:42,270
And the public knows it.

30
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,357
You gentlemen

31
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,359
<i>have allowed it to happen.</i>

32
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,197
Mr. tung, as head
of the marketing division,

33
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,240
what do you propose?

34
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,201
We need to demonstrate

35
00:06:57,202 --> 00:07:00,245
the superiority
of our bioengineered implants

36
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,873
in a vivid, spectacular fashion,

37
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:07,002
which means we need to pit
our cyber enhancements

38
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:10,422
<i>against all the others
in direct competition</i>

39
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:12,967
<i>on a world stage for all to see.</i>

40
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:17,722
It would be the media event
of all time.

41
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:22,434
All very noble, Mr. tung,

42
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:27,439
but how is such a goal attained?

43
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,983
We sponsor a fighting tournament

44
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,945
where all the greatest fighters
in the world are invited.

45
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:37,491
<i>Each corporation will bioenhance
a combatant of their choice.</i>

46
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,910
The best cyber technology wins.

47
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,953
Simple!

48
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:46,333
It would be the super bowl,
world cup, and Olympics

49
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:51,088
<i>rolled up in
one multimedia mega-event.</i>

50
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:54,884
<i>Think of the marketing bonanza.</i>

51
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:59,263
This is a crazy dream.

52
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:03,850
No corporation
is going to sponsor an event

53
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,519
where people could be killed.

54
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,314
Just last week
a football player was paralyzed,

55
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:10,608
and in a speed car race

56
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,526
two drivers
were burned to death.

57
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:15,904
<i>It's part of the public lure.</i>

58
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,364
The public doesn't hold
the sponsor responsible,

59
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:19,408
unless of course

60
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,286
the entertainment
is of poor quality.

61
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:25,539
It's ridiculous.

62
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,586
Each journey
begins with a single step.

63
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,296
The tournament
may be that step higher,

64
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,423
but it is crucial

65
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:37,551
that the step
be in the right direction.

66
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,511
You're confident
you do have a man who can

67
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:42,306
<i>win this tournament?</i>

68
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:44,516
As a matter of fact, I do.

69
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:49,314
Gentlemen, this is xao.

70
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,317
<i>He has agreed
to be our representative</i>

71
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,068
<i>in the tournament.</i>

72
00:08:55,069 --> 00:09:00,240
The one who lost the bout
to a pure human, an American.

73
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,952
That was before
some changes were made.

74
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,996
Two current
full-contact champions.

75
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:08,290
<i>Each man gets
10 million euro-credits</i>

76
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,001
<i>if they can defeat our champion.</i>

77
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,229
Oh, my God!

78
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,479
As you can see,
he's not the same fighter or man

79
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,773
<i>he was six months ago.</i>

80
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:18,068
I don't think the word "man"
even applies.

81
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,362
<i>Isn't there a rule
that fighters must be at least</i>

82
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,657
90% human?

83
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:26,243
<i>This is our tournament
on our private island</i>

84
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,495
<i>outside the jurisdiction
of any country.</i>

85
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:32,957
We'll increase the allowance
of cyber implants to 50%.

86
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,459
<i>After all,
the reason for the tournament</i>

87
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,086
is to demonstrate
the superiority

88
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:38,630
of biomechanical systems
over human tissue, right?

89
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:39,839
Right.

90
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,802
Now what if a pure human
wants to compete?

91
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:47,180
The tournament is
completely open to all,

92
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:50,267
- even pure humans.
- Even the American.

93
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:54,688
Chance o'brien is considered
the greatest champion ever.

94
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,398
It is our intention

95
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,275
to have him compete
in the tournament.

96
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:00,319
But can xao beat him?

97
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,115
We'll make sure he does.

98
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:17,544
We will let you take this step,
Mr. tung.

99
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:24,217
But remember,
xao's fate and yours

100
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,720
are one and the same.

101
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,782
<i>Oh, my!
We've got another great fight.</i>

102
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,075
<i>The world's number-one
ranked challenger</i>

103
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,034
<i>is giving the champion,</i>

104
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,162
<i>chance o'brien,
all he can handle.</i>

105
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:54,247
<i>Raul comes to this fight
with an impressive</i>

106
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,082
<i>29 and 1 record,</i>

107
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,668
<i>the lone loss coming early
in his career</i>

108
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,044
<i>before he had
his cyber implants.</i>

109
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:02,213
<i>O'brien has seemed
sluggish so far.</i>

110
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:04,257
<i>His mind doesn't seem
focused on the fight.</i>

111
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,844
<i>His showboating and sluggish
performance thus far</i>

112
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:09,137
<i>has not pleased his manager, Jo.</i>

113
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:11,181
<i>Raul could build up
enough points</i>

114
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:12,766
<i>in the computer scoring
that could endanger</i>

115
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,143
<i>o'brien's hold on
the world title</i>

116
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,436
<i>he has held for three years.</i>

117
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,524
<i>Oh, boy! There's a little
of o'brien's power.</i>

118
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:31,035
Stop fooling around!

119
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:34,539
<i>But Raul comes right back!</i>

120
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:46,050
<i>And there's the bell
ending the round.</i>

121
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,720
What the hell
are you doing out there?

122
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,555
That ought to have a tag
on his toe by now.

123
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:55,517
- Hey, you want to give it a try?
- Knock it off!

124
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:56,434
You're defending your title.

125
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:57,937
Now get out there
and fight like it.

126
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,441
- Will you marry me?
- What?

127
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,445
Will you marry me?

128
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:09,073
You're asking me now?

129
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,451
Yeah. I mean, we can stay here.

130
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,829
I tell you what, champ.

131
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,498
I'll marry
whoever wins this bout.

132
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,583
<i>There seems to be a heated</i>

133
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:21,877
<i>discussion
in the champion's corner.</i>

134
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,545
<i>Jo has got to have told o'brien</i>

135
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:26,089
<i>that he is on the verge
of losing his title.</i>

136
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,549
<i>Let's see if it's had any effect</i>

137
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,594
<i>on o'brien's coming out strong.</i>

138
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,688
<i>He's going
right to a flying kick!</i>

139
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:42,940
<i>Raul's going down!</i>

140
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,610
<i>The real champ o'brien
seems to have shown up.</i>

141
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:51,323
Yeah!

142
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:04,586
Hey, Raul,

143
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:05,629
you know who Jo is, don't you?

144
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,838
Yeah, your trainer?

145
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,172
Yeah, she's right over there.

146
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,925
- Why don't you take a look?
- What?

147
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:11,635
Go ahead, take a look.
I'm not going to hit you.

148
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:13,804
<i>Wait, o'brien
and Raul seem to be</i>

149
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:15,179
<i>having some kind of discussion</i>

150
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,432
<i>out in the middle of the ring.</i>

151
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,601
What in the hell?

152
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:20,644
Sweet girl.

153
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:23,396
Well, she said she'll marry
whoever wins this.

154
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,273
Really?

155
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,984
Maybe I'd better go rent a tux.

156
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,443
<i>The conversation seems directed</i>

157
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:31,738
<i>- at o'brien's manager, Jo.</i>
- What's going on?

158
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,490
<i>I can't quite hear
what they're saying.</i>

159
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:34,574
<i>But here we go.</i>

160
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,368
<i>The fighters seem
ready to fight again.</i>

161
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:43,333
Honeymoon in Hawaii?

162
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:45,794
Yeah, how about a cold
day in hell?

163
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:48,547
Really?

164
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:55,805
Okay, come on!

165
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,309
Come on, chance!

166
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:05,648
Yeah! There you go, baby!

167
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,325
<i>Oh, golly! What a kick!</i>

168
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,703
<i>That's lights out for Raul.</i>

169
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,788
<i>Chance o'brien successfully</i>

170
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:24,916
<i>defends his championship
for the eleventh time.</i>

171
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,626
<i>He has staked his claim</i>

172
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,338
<i>as the greatest fighter
in the world today.</i>

173
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,092
All right, baby!

174
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:35,928
Chance! Chance!

175
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:54,529
Who do you fight next?

176
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,866
Actually, my next
fight is with my trainer

177
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,536
here about where we're
going on our honeymoon.

178
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,793
A fight against
the heavyweight champion

179
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,088
astasio would be fantastic.

180
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:13,716
Not for astasio.

181
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,054
What about the tournament

182
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:20,890
held by the sianon corporation?

183
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,850
What about it?

184
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,268
Well, as the greatest

185
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:28,438
human fighter in the world,

186
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,314
do you intend to
test your fighting skills

187
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:31,733
against the world's
foremost cyborgs?

188
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,192
Mr. o'brien is not interested

189
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,862
in proving himself
to a bunch of robots

190
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:37,739
<i>and used car parts.</i>

191
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,951
Xao will be competing.
You owe him a rematch.

192
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:46,748
Or are you afraid that your win

193
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:48,918
was just human luck?

194
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:52,379
I'll tell you what, Mr...

195
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:57,383
You know my name. Tung.

196
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,302
Tung.

197
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:02,555
If you give me the 60 million

198
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,683
you're offering in platinum,

199
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:06,643
I'll show you some luck.

200
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:09,395
It's yours, if you earn it.

201
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,647
We're not interested.

202
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:14,151
Chance o'brien is
a legitimate world champion.

203
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,027
He doesn't have to fight
in your bloodfest.

204
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:18,905
So Mr. o'brien is afraid of xao.

205
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:20,074
<i>Not afraid.</i>

206
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,909
He'd rip his implants off

207
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,495
and shove them up
his synthetic ass.

208
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:28,081
Like she says,
we're not interested.

209
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:30,500
It's getting late,
and if anyone doesn't have

210
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:33,586
an intelligent question,
we'll call it a night.

211
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,839
Thanks a lot, everyone.

212
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,883
Sorry if these clowns
ruined it for you.

213
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,847
I expect you all to be there.

214
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:58,361
So now that you're not in
such a weakened state,

215
00:17:58,362 --> 00:17:59,821
still want to marry me?

216
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,614
Honey, when you're around,

217
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,074
I'm always in a weakened state.

218
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:06,245
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

219
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:09,831
Well, if you put it that way,

220
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:10,874
how can I say no?

221
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,375
Well, you could try.

222
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:13,502
But I'm tougher than you are.

223
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:19,090
Come on, Mrs. o'brien,
I'll buy you some breakfast.

224
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:20,384
Sounds great.

225
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:30,393
Ah, I love Rome.
It's so romantic.

226
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,979
It's like an old
movie or something.

227
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,899
Let's get married
here in the spring.

228
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:37,901
It would be great to do it

229
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:40,945
with 60 mill in platinum.

230
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,240
We don't need the money.

231
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,910
You know he's jacked up more.

232
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,205
It's past the limit, but I
bet I could still beat him.

233
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:51,915
I'm not going to let you go.

234
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,042
Why?

235
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:56,753
Jo, if I win this, I never
have to fight again.

236
00:18:56,754 --> 00:19:00,131
If you lose, I'll never have

237
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:01,759
a chance to say I do.

238
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:06,512
You think I can't win.

239
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,431
No.

240
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:09,807
It's not about winning, chance.

241
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:12,476
It's not even about competition.

242
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:16,981
It's sales and
market shares and profits.

243
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:18,650
It's not you or me.

244
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:23,781
What?

245
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,576
I love you.

246
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,829
<i>- You have no idea.</i>
- No.

247
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:34,292
I'm going to prove it to you.

248
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:48,347
With this ring, I thee wed.

249
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:06,324
And with this whistle,
I thee wed.

250
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,981
Hey!

251
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:57,416
You're so good.

252
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:05,048
<i>Looks like my clowns spoiled</i>

253
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,133
your fun again, huh?

254
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,678
Come on.

255
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:16,475
You should have
accepted our invitation.

256
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,812
The publicity would have been
great for both of us.

257
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:23,817
Well, since you
won't do it for money,

258
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,322
<i>maybe you'll do it for love.</i>

259
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:33,285
<i>See you at the fights,
Mr. o'brienski.</i>

260
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,251
Mr. o'brien, the world champion.

261
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:06,420
We've been expecting you.

262
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:12,550
I'm a big fan of yours myself.

263
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,135
Where is this tournament
being held?

264
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:16,429
Iridoken island,
and you're scheduled

265
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,807
- to register tomorrow.
- Thanks.

266
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:39,203
We're going to break
this boy down.

267
00:23:57,095 --> 00:23:59,263
You shouldn't be here
by yourself.

268
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:00,474
Lots of bad people here.

269
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:15,084
Hey, look, I need
to take these shoes.

270
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:17,169
I promise I'll come back
and I'll pay you later.

271
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,630
I promise. I promise.

272
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:37,022
Anybody knows
where the docks are?

273
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:38,900
The docks.

274
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:52,080
Hey, does anyone know
where the docks are?

275
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,333
Does anybody know
where the boats come in?

276
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:57,461
Huh?

277
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,337
Hey! Hey!

278
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:01,505
Do you guys know
where the docks are?

279
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:05,468
- The docks.
- Docks?

280
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:08,011
The docks! The docks,
where the boats come in.

281
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:08,930
Ah, docks.

282
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:11,641
Yeah.

283
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:13,267
- Over there.
- That way.

284
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:16,480
<i>- That way.</i>
- No, no. That way.

285
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,985
Whoa!

286
00:28:25,823 --> 00:28:27,616
Hey! What the hell
is wrong with you?

287
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:08,615
Hey, wait up!

288
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:10,659
Hey, wait!

289
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:14,037
Hey! Hey!

Chance o'brien.

292
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:41,104
No, that's okay.

293
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:42,356
I don't want to know somebody

294
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:43,400
I might have to kill.

00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:09,132

Put your hand over there.

298
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:18,852
Step over there.

299
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:22,145

Hey, sorry about the car.

Forget it.

You always go
jogging in the nude?

328
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:50,192

356
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:11,356
<i>sianon guarantees
to give you the body</i>

357
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:14,359
<i>and face you've always wanted,</i>

358
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,819
<i>rebuilt with cyber-enhanced</i>

359
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,988
<i>implants into
a more powerful you.</i>

360
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:20,824
<i>So do you really
want to look like this</i>

361
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:23,368
<i>when in three days
you could look like this?</i>

362
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:26,246
<i>A safer, better-looking
cyber future</i>

363
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,041
<i>from the sianon corporation.</i>

364
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:31,419
You know where xao is staying?

365
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:35,172
That's top secret.

366
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:36,840
All the corporations
have taken a lot

367
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:39,051
of security to protect
their products

368
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:41,971
- from any tampering.
- Oh, yeah?

369
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:45,141
Well, where is
all your security?

370
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:46,809
You're looking at
the chairman of the board.

371
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,227
I can do what I want.

372
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,147
For all the money we were
going to spend on a fighter,

373
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:52,815
I just figured I'd do it myself.

374
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:55,567
Yeah, well, you may find
the ring a little tougher

375
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:56,694
than the boardroom.

376
00:33:57,988 --> 00:33:59,947
I was pro before
I went corporate.

377
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:01,573
I can handle it.

378
00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:03,075
Don't tell me your family--

379
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,327
Yeah, dear old dad.

380
00:34:05,328 --> 00:34:06,955
Well, at least you had a choice.

381
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:10,373
Is someone forcing
you to be here?

382
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:11,960
Sianon.

383
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:46,160
Now, Ms. Tobin,
if you promise to be good,

384
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,078
<i>I'll have your chip deactivated.</i>

385
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,247
<i>Okay?</i>

386
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:53,834
There.

387
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:55,128
Fuck you, asshole!

388
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,551
<i>Bad, bad girl!</i>

389
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,845
Boy, you have
a lot of fight in you.

390
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:06,347
It's too bad you're not a man.

391
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,019
<i>Now, one more time, be good,</i>

392
00:35:12,103 --> 00:35:14,980
and the chip is deactivated.

393
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:17,400
Okay? Simple, there.

394
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:22,030
You're not being good.

395
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:26,367
All right.

396
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:29,537
All right?

397
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:34,875
You went through
a lot of trouble,

398
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:39,755
didn't you, to get chance to
enter this two-bit tournament?

399
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:41,798
Well, it turns out
that the majority

400
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:43,133
of the public didn't consider it

401
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,718
a true world championship

402
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,720
without the participation
of a real champion,

403
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:50,140
so we convinced every champion

404
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:54,228
of every style to,
shall we say, enlist.

405
00:35:54,229 --> 00:35:56,521
That's a lot of kidnapping.

406
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:59,066
<i>Fortunately, they were not</i>

407
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:01,318
<i>immune to cash inducements.</i>

408
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:04,905
<i>Only one champion
resisted all our efforts.</i>

409
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:07,283
Integrity is a drag.

410
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:10,577
Believe me, this was not the way

411
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:11,704
we wanted to do it.

412
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,959
So what happens now, hmm?

413
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:18,668
<i>What, are you going to kill me?</i>

414
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:19,753
<i>Is that it?</i>

415
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:22,423
Oh, unless chance
does his fight with xao?

416
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:26,177
We don't believe
Mr. o'brien has a...

417
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:29,596
How do you Americans say it?

418
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:32,100
A snowball's chance in hell?

419
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:36,104
What do you want with me?

420
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:43,277
We want you to train xao.

421
00:36:43,278 --> 00:36:45,821
Why would I do
something like that?

422
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:47,156
Because if you don't,

423
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:48,782
Mr. o'brien's survival chances

424
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:50,368
<i>won't be very promising.</i>

425
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,704
<i>We'll reward you handsomely.</i>

426
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:57,000
- Fuck you and your money!
- Ouch!

427
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:00,210
Before you
finalize the decision,

428
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:02,796
and in effect doom
Mr. o'brien's life,

429
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:04,715
please allow me
to show you something.

430
00:37:21,482 --> 00:37:22,565
He doesn't need a trainer,

431
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:23,942
he needs a goddamn leash.

432
00:37:23,943 --> 00:37:25,568
He's impressive, isn't he?

433
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:28,613
Yeah, but he has no heart.

434
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,614
He never has.

435
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:30,740
That's why chance beat him.

436
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:32,868
Yeah, unfortunately
you're right.

437
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:34,452
But we're hoping
that your training

438
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,664
will give him what his
poor upbringing took away.

439
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,001
I won't train him.

440
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:43,586
Actually, we would like you

441
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,631
to show him a certain
amount of...

442
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:52,179
Yes, love, if you will.

443
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,181
What the hell are
you talking about?

444
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:59,228
Your attention will give him

445
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:03,816
the confidence
he needs to... to win.

446
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:07,277
Look what it did for o'brien.

447
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:09,696
You want me to fuck
him, don't you?

448
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:10,698
No.

449
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:12,950
No.

450
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:16,078
Don't you get it?

451
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,789
He needs love! Love!

452
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:30,718
I want you to love him.

453
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:34,305
That's what he needs.

454
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:41,811
<i>This place is a little small.</i>

455
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,813
This is nothing.

456
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:45,232
I've got someone here
who can help you

457
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:46,775
<i>find out where
is xao is staying.</i>

458
00:38:46,776 --> 00:38:47,650
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

459
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:48,818
<i>This tournament,</i>

460
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:51,280
<i>the sianon corporation's
own representative, xao.</i>

461
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,782
<i>I'll do what I can to help.</i>

462
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:56,118
But you come up against me

463
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,828
in this tournament
and I'll crush you.

464
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:00,709
You help me find xao
and the tournament's yours.

465
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:06,128
Nice toys you have here.

466
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:07,754
You can't be too prepared.

467
00:39:07,755 --> 00:39:10,548
<i>Liu, we need to help
Mr. o'brien find out</i>

468
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,885
<i>where xao's training camp is.</i>

469
00:39:13,886 --> 00:39:14,928
Most of the corporate sites

470
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:16,638
are using electronic cloaking.

471
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,099
It's not going to be easy.

472
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,144
I thought you might
as well relax a while.

473
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:23,480
It's going to take some time.

474
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,621
What are you doing here?

475
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:44,835
Just thought I'd come
and give you some pointers.

476
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,753
I have coaches, you know.

477
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:52,300
I know.

478
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:07,356
You know, you should

479
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:08,816
switch your balance to the left.

480
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:12,861
Why don't you go back

481
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:14,447
to chance o'brien
where you belong?

482
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,825
It's over between us.

483
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:23,205
That's not what it
looked like the last time

484
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:24,415
I saw the two of you together.

485
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,418
Things change.

486
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:29,587
Bullshit!

487
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,964
You know, I could
have left here.

488
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:35,218
Oh? So what are you
doing here, then?

489
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:43,476
I'm here for you.

490
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:02,202
<i>Welcome to day one
of the tournament.</i>

491
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:04,079
<i>56 cyber corporations</i>

492
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,914
<i>are represented
here by the greatest</i>

493
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:07,790
<i>fighters of all time.</i>

494
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,460
<i>Every one of them
is a current or former</i>

495
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:12,921
<i>world champion,
and some, like xao</i>

496
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:14,964
<i>of the sianon corporation,</i>

497
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:17,008
<i>are undeclared weapons.</i>

498
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:18,594
<i>This tournament isn't just about</i>

499
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:21,388
<i>who the best fighter is,
but also about</i>

500
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:24,057
<i>who has the best cyber
implant system.</i>

501
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:25,767
<i>It's an exciting challenge</i>

502
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:27,810
<i>for the world's
cyber corporations.</i>

503
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:30,146
<i>For the first time,
fighters will be</i>

504
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:32,815
<i>allowed to be cybered up to 50%</i>

505
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:34,443
<i>of their total mass.</i>

506
00:41:34,444 --> 00:41:36,069
<i>The opening of the tournament</i>

507
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,406
<i>will be handled by tung,
the head of marketing</i>

508
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:42,576
<i>for the sponsoring
sianon corporation.</i>

509
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:44,245
Welcome to
the sianon tournament.

510
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:46,872
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

511
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,091
<i>Here we go with
the first round of action.</i>

512
00:41:58,092 --> 00:41:59,217
Fighters!

513
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:01,219
<i>The first fighter is bodo,</i>

514
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,140
<i>representing the du canne
cyber corporation of France.</i>

515
00:42:05,141 --> 00:42:06,516
<i>His opponent is ikila,</i>

516
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:08,518
<i>representing the siwa cybertron</i>

517
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:11,062
<i>corporation of Bombay.</i>

518
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:14,483
<i>Bodo fights in the world
cybertronic association.</i>

519
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:16,526
<i>His style is a mutant version</i>

520
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:18,528
<i>of outlaw shootfighting.</i>

521
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:20,363
<i>He is the current world champion</i>

522
00:42:20,364 --> 00:42:23,533
<i>in his weight and

523
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:26,911
<i>His record is 67 wins,
no losses,</i>

524
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:28,497
<i>and he has sent four men</i>

525
00:42:28,498 --> 00:42:30,248
<i>to their deaths in the ring.</i>

526
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:33,669
<i>Ikila is a generation
one cyber fighter.</i>

527
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,339
<i>Siwa is a new corporation
trying to get started.</i>

528
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,133
<i>They're hoping, with an
impressive showing here,</i>

529
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:41,551
<i>their stock prices will rise,</i>

530
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:43,886
<i>giving them the capital
they need to play</i>

531
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:45,555
<i>with the larger corporations</i>

<i>such as sianon and du canne.</i>

533
00:42:48,142 --> 00:42:50,435
<i>Well, it's an
apparent right off,</i>

534
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:52,437
<i>bodo's superior cyber implants</i>

535
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:53,896
<i>are going to win out.</i>

536
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:55,565
<i>He's beginning to dominate here</i>

537
00:42:55,566 --> 00:42:59,027
<i>with his super-charged
speed and strength.</i>

538
00:42:59,028 --> 00:43:01,279
<i>Bodo's just toying
with ikila now.</i>

539
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,989
<i>A quick look at the stock market</i>

540
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,241
<i>shows ikila's corporation</i>

541
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,203
<i>is starting to lose stock value.</i>

542
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:18,380
<i>And that's the end.</i>

543
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:21,174
<i>Bodo wins with a time of 3:16.</i>

544
00:43:21,175 --> 00:43:23,926
<i>Bodo is one of the favorites
to reach the finals.</i>

545
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:26,304
<i>Bodo's sponsor, du canne,</i>

546
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:28,890
<i>has seen their stock prices
rise dramatically...</i>

547
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:31,643
<i>Representing
the nubicon corporation</i>

548
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:34,688
<i>of khartoum is tal Aziz.</i>

549
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:36,939
<i>The ferocious nubian
has a record</i>

550
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,651
<i>of 81 wins and no losses.</i>

551
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:41,570
<i>Tal Aziz has actually come out</i>

552
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:43,405
<i>of retirement for this fight.</i>

553
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:46,449
<i>Jolly, tal Aziz's
opponent, represents</i>

554
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:49,327
<i>the tokao corporation
of Singapore.</i>

555
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:51,580
<i>Their fighter is a journeyman</i>

556
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:54,249
<i>in the world cyber circuit
and comes here</i>

557
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,753
<i>with a 47 win,
three loss record.</i>

558
00:43:57,754 --> 00:44:02,257
<i>Jolly uses the tiger style,
but tal Aziz is clearly</i>

559
00:44:02,258 --> 00:44:04,133
<i>the superior fighter here.</i>

560
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:06,720
<i>His implants appear to
give him a huge advantage.</i>

561
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:09,305
<i>Jolly has proven
first generation</i>

562
00:44:09,306 --> 00:44:12,975
<i>cyber technology just
isn't up to this competition.</i>

563
00:44:12,976 --> 00:44:15,478
<i>Oh, my! The
nubicon corporation stock</i>

564
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:17,980
<i>has risen by 16 points!</i>

565
00:44:17,981 --> 00:44:19,857
<i>The tokao corporation stock,</i>

566
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:22,402
<i>by contrast, has just collapsed.</i>

567
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:25,988
<i>The next challenger is
the highly regarded sante.</i>

568
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:29,701
<i>Sante is a fluid
monkey chi stylist.</i>

569
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:32,245
<i>Chung is the current world cyber</i>

570
00:44:32,246 --> 00:44:36,124
<i>all-around champion.
His sponsor, kalbag,</i>

571
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:39,168
<i>is the second largest cyber
corporation in the world,</i>

572
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:40,420
<i>and their market share</i>

573
00:44:40,421 --> 00:44:42,088
<i>has risen to the point
where they now</i>

574
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:46,051
<i>challenge sianon's
number one position.</i>

575
00:45:14,246 --> 00:45:16,914
<i>Oh, my! Chung
delivers a kill blow!</i>

576
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,502
<i>That makes it 29
kills for chung!</i>

577
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:32,473
I've located xao's whereabouts.

578
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:35,643
Well, let's go.

579
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:47,403
You're still leading
with your left

580
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:49,365
and you're leaving
your right side open.

581
00:45:53,577 --> 00:45:54,994
<i>He's not showing
much improvement.</i>

582
00:45:54,995 --> 00:45:56,954
I'm doing the best I can.

583
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:59,291
All right, I think it is time
we had another little talk.

584
00:46:06,507 --> 00:46:07,799
What do you want?

585
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,175
Haven't I done
a good enough job?

586
00:46:09,176 --> 00:46:11,428
I just want a little
cooperation, that's all.

587
00:47:29,423 --> 00:47:31,466
Okay, xao is definitely in here.

588
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:33,259
<i>So is tung.</i>

589
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,470
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

590
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:38,139
<i>Look, are you
sure about this? Huh?</i>

591
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,599
<i>They catch you,
this is their island,</i>

592
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,978
<i>their laws, and they can make
you disappear forever.</i>

593
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:43,895
<i>They asked me to fight,</i>

594
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:46,355
<i>and I'm fighting, all right?
I got to get in there.</i>

595
00:47:46,356 --> 00:47:49,484
Wait! Wait!

596
00:47:49,485 --> 00:47:50,402
A gift from liu.

597
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:53,405
Good luck.

598
00:50:12,711 --> 00:50:14,587
Mr. o'brien, we are
within our rights

599
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:16,173
to execute you for trespassing.

600
00:50:29,311 --> 00:50:31,187
<i>You know,</i>

601
00:50:31,188 --> 00:50:32,563
since you did
enter the tournament,

602
00:50:32,564 --> 00:50:35,524
we of course
offered to set Jo free,

603
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:37,568
<i>but imagine our surprise
when she refused to go.</i>

604
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:39,821
<i>Life.</i>

605
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:44,076
Life is truly a series of
unexpected turns.

606
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,539
What have you done with her?

607
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,584
Nothing... yet.

608
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:58,024
Looks like you're
going to make it.

609
00:51:58,025 --> 00:51:59,650
What the hell happened?

610
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,278
My people found
you on the street.

611
00:52:06,992 --> 00:52:09,451
Looks like I got a little more
than I bargained for.

612
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:13,289
Yeah, well, I hope
it was worth the effort.

613
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,041
You're supposed
to fight this morning.

614
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,458
I don't think you're
going to make it.

615
00:52:16,459 --> 00:52:18,879
That's just what
tung is expecting.

616
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:22,798
Whatever you say, champ.

617
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,134
It's your funeral.

618
00:52:34,728 --> 00:52:36,146
How's it feel?

619
00:52:40,025 --> 00:52:41,944
O'brien, you're up.

620
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:51,452
Good luck.

621
00:52:51,453 --> 00:52:53,579
<i>It's a surprise to see</i>

622
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,915
<i>chance o'brien here
in this tournament.</i>

623
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:59,085
<i>His disdain for cyber-enhanced
fighters is well known,</i>

624
00:52:59,086 --> 00:53:01,003
<i>and he has continually
told the press</i>

625
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:03,798
<i>that he would not compete
here in this tournament.</i>

626
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:05,674
<i>Well, something
must have changed.</i>

627
00:53:05,675 --> 00:53:07,551
<i>Mr. o'brien's mind.</i>

628
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:09,971
<i>Could it be the
60 million first prize?</i>

629
00:53:09,972 --> 00:53:11,722
<i>O'brien, of course,
is considered</i>

630
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:13,808
<i>the greatest fighter
in the world today.</i>

631
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:15,268
<i>He has never been defeated</i>

632
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:17,645
<i>and has continued to
prove his dominance</i>

633
00:53:17,646 --> 00:53:20,940
<i>against all fighters
from all weight categories</i>

634
00:53:20,941 --> 00:53:22,650
<i>from all styles.</i>

635
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:24,152
<i>One thing that could
have caused his</i>

636
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:27,238
<i>change of heart is
the loss of his manager,</i>

637
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:30,616
<i>Jo, who is in xao's
sianon training camp.</i>

638
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:32,785
<i>Perhaps he's here
for a little revenge.</i>

639
00:53:32,786 --> 00:53:35,037
<i>But skill or no skill,</i>

640
00:53:35,038 --> 00:53:37,623
<i>o'brien has got a tough
road ahead of him.</i>

641
00:53:37,624 --> 00:53:39,917
<i>He'll be facing
the most jacked-up</i>

642
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:43,212
<i>and powerful fighters
he has ever faced.</i>

643
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:45,923
<i>O'brien's opponent is Arturo.</i>

644
00:53:45,924 --> 00:53:48,717
<i>Arturo represents
a mid-sized corporation,</i>

645
00:53:48,718 --> 00:53:50,803
<i>which operates
out of Mexico city.</i>

646
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:52,930
<i>Arturo's record is an impressive</i>

647
00:53:52,931 --> 00:53:54,932
<i>54 wins and no losses.</i>

648
00:53:54,933 --> 00:53:57,186
<i>Arturo fights in nirvana style.</i>

649
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:14,743
<i>O'brien seems driven here.</i>

650
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:16,829
<i>I don't think I've ever
seen him so pumped up.</i>

651
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,041
<i>He seems to be punishing
his opponent.</i>

652
00:54:29,676 --> 00:54:31,802
<i>Well, there it is.</i>

653
00:54:31,803 --> 00:54:34,596
<i>O'brien advances, but you have</i>

654
00:54:34,597 --> 00:54:36,598
<i>to wonder if the loss
of his trainer</i>

655
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,894
<i>won't hamper his
chances down the road.</i>

656
00:54:41,855 --> 00:54:44,106
<i>This is an interesting match-up.</i>

657
00:54:44,107 --> 00:54:46,942
<i>Earl is a grappling
stylist from Ghana.</i>

658
00:54:46,943 --> 00:54:50,238
<i>He represents the hassa
corporation of Liberia</i>

659
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:53,366
<i>with a record of
38 wins and one loss.</i>

660
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:55,617
<i>He has killed 13
men in the ring.</i>

661
00:54:55,618 --> 00:54:59,372
<i>His opponent, bokandu,
is a Kali stylist</i>

662
00:54:59,373 --> 00:55:02,708
<i>from the tokay corporation
based in Jakarta.</i>

663
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:05,127
<i>Bokandu is an outlaw fighter</i>

664
00:55:05,128 --> 00:55:07,755
<i>who has recently been
in prison for murder.</i>

665
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:09,673
<i>The tokay corporation
got him out</i>

666
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:10,926
<i>just for this event.</i>

667
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,616
<i>Bokandu is confused by
Earl's grappling action.</i>

668
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:37,201
<i>It seems only a matter of time</i>

669
00:55:37,202 --> 00:55:39,161
<i>before Earl can put his infamous</i>

670
00:55:39,162 --> 00:55:41,123
<i>neck-breaker on bokandu.</i>

671
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:03,270
<i>There it is, the neck-breaker!</i>

672
00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:06,688
<i>And it's over.</i>

673
00:56:06,689 --> 00:56:10,068
<i>Earl wins, bokandu has expired.</i>

674
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:24,832
<i>Mario represents</i>

675
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:27,835
<i>the zikan corporation of Brazil.</i>

676
00:56:27,836 --> 00:56:30,879
<i>His style is that
of a kendo-crane mix</i>

677
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,382
<i>with the strength
of the cyber-speed implants</i>

678
00:56:33,383 --> 00:56:35,843
<i>developed by
the zikan corporation.</i>

679
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:37,470
<i>His opponent is lito.</i>

680
00:56:37,471 --> 00:56:40,139
<i>Lito is a rising star
in the Asian circuit</i>

681
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,142
<i>and he was recruited by
the genpact corporation</i>

682
00:56:43,143 --> 00:56:46,396
<i>to be the recipient of their
new alto technology.</i>

683
00:57:09,252 --> 00:57:11,253
<i>Well, it's back
to the drawing board</i>

684
00:57:11,254 --> 00:57:12,880
<i>for the genpact corporation.</i>

685
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:15,217
<i>Mario wins and advances.</i>

686
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:24,017
Chance! Chance!

687
00:57:40,576 --> 00:57:42,493
If I don't win this tournament,

688
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:43,869
the company is finished.

689
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:47,957
Isn't there some way
you can turn it around?

690
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:52,086
I made some bad
deals along the way,

691
00:57:52,087 --> 00:57:53,338
some of them illegal.

692
00:57:55,298 --> 00:57:56,758
My dad took the fall for me.

693
00:57:58,009 --> 00:57:59,968
I can't turn that around.

694
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:01,221
Come on, let's finish our run.

695
00:58:06,226 --> 00:58:07,269
Fight!

696
00:58:27,497 --> 00:58:28,665
Yeah!

697
00:58:38,383 --> 00:58:40,551
<i>Final bout
of the quarter-finals.</i>

698
00:58:40,552 --> 00:58:43,387
<i>It's bodo of the
du canne corporation</i>

699
00:58:43,388 --> 00:58:45,222
<i>versus chance o'brien,</i>

700
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:48,976
<i>the only 100% human
fighter in the tournament.</i>

701
00:58:48,977 --> 00:58:52,104
<i>O'brien has a formidable
opponent in front of him</i>

702
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:53,230
<i>as bodo has killed his</i>

703
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:55,442
<i>last three
challengers in the ring.</i>

704
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:01,113
<i>Both stylists have
speed and power.</i>

705
00:59:01,114 --> 00:59:04,909
<i>The edge has to go bodo
with all his cyber implants.</i>

706
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:09,580
<i>Rumors abound
that bodo has secretly</i>

707
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:12,625
<i>jacked up closer
to the 60% level</i>

708
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:15,503
<i>by disguising his
microbiotic implants</i>

709
00:59:15,504 --> 00:59:17,547
<i>in live human tissue.</i>

710
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,088
<i>Implants or not,
bodo doesn't seem to be</i>

711
01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:02,216
<i>able to stop o'brien's attacks.</i>

712
01:00:02,217 --> 01:00:04,593
<i>Everything bodo
tries is swept aside</i>

713
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:07,597
<i>and answered by
o'brien's relentless assault.</i>

714
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:36,542
<i>What a kick from o'brien!</i>

715
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:38,711
<i>Bodo's neck, which
is listed as human,</i>

716
01:00:38,712 --> 01:00:41,088
<i>reveals cybergenic implants.</i>

717
01:00:41,089 --> 01:00:43,924
<i>Bodo cheated, but to no avail.</i>

718
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:46,135
<i>O'brien advances.</i>

719
01:00:55,895 --> 01:00:58,398
Of course, for me, there is
no serious competition here.

720
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:02,651
I definitely cannot
foresee any competition,

721
01:01:02,652 --> 01:01:04,612
and as for chance o'brien,

722
01:01:04,613 --> 01:01:06,405
the last time was purely luck.

723
01:01:06,406 --> 01:01:08,115
I'm in the greatest
shape of my life

724
01:01:08,116 --> 01:01:09,576
thanks to my new trainer.

725
01:01:12,161 --> 01:01:15,081
Hey! Hey! Hey!

726
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,042
<i>Are you training xao now?</i>

727
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:20,711
<i>What happened to
you and chance o'brien?</i>

728
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:23,297
She decided to back a winner.

729
01:01:23,298 --> 01:01:25,507
What are you doing,
Jo, huh? What are you doing?

730
01:01:25,508 --> 01:01:27,259
Save it for the ring, o'brien.

731
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,302
You're going to need it.

732
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:30,304
What I'm going to need is
a broom to sweep up

733
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:33,014
after what's left of you
and your fucking tin man.

734
01:01:33,015 --> 01:01:34,433
If that's the best he can do,

735
01:01:34,434 --> 01:01:35,476
we have nothing to worry about.

736
01:01:35,477 --> 01:01:37,102
Jo!

737
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:38,104
Jo!

738
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:57,332
Ha! Looks like you've got
a weak spot after all.

739
01:01:58,374 --> 01:02:01,961
Ow! Stop.

740
01:02:05,465 --> 01:02:07,342
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

741
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:14,265
Not yet. Are you ready?

742
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,768
You mean when you're ready.

743
01:02:26,528 --> 01:02:29,196
<i>Bradford is well known
as the fighting chairman</i>

01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:43,669
<i>not willing to go down

750
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,213
<i>Bradford has been retired
the last three years</i>

751

Whoo!

01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:10,692
Hey, man. Good luck.

770
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:22,203
I know. I know I deserve it.

771
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:24,413
Xao is up.

Xao<i> enters the ring</i>

01:05:51,273 --> 01:05:53,650
<i>with his new
state-of-the-art implants.</i>

780
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:56,028
<i>Obviously sianon

01:05:56,029 --> 01:05:57,863
<i>to make an impressive
impact here</i>

782
01:05:57,864 --> 01:05:59,280

783
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:01,575
<i>Xao has coasted
through the other rounds</i>

784
01:06:01,576 --> 01:06:03,702
<i>as opponents have defaulted</i>

785
01:06:03,703 --> 01:06:05,454
<i>or have been

786
01:06:12,378 --> 01:06:15,422
<i>Xao's opponent here is tal Aziz,</i>

787
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,550
<i>the nubian from
the nubicon corporation.</i>

788
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:20,468
<i>Both companies' market shares</i>

789
01:06:20,469 --> 01:06:23,764

790
01:06:23,765 --> 01:06:24,723
<i>Fight!</i>

791
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:26,808
<i>And here we go.</i>

792
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:29,644
<i>What a battle this
should be with xao,</i>

793
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:31,855
<i>a disciple of
the wing chun school,</i>

794
01:06:31,856 --> 01:06:34,901
<i>and tal Aziz, a nuba stylist.</i>

795
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:17,109
<i>Oh, my! Xao is incredible.</i>

796
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,526
<i>His speed and power
are going to be</i>

797
01:07:18,527 --> 01:07:19,945
<i>too much for the nubian.</i>

798
01:07:19,946 --> 01:07:24,408
Christ, he makes me think twice
about fighting him.

799
01:07:33,835 --> 01:07:36,628
<i>I think tal Aziz knows
he's in trouble here.</i>

800
01:07:36,629 --> 01:07:38,379
<i>What a horrifying glimpse</i>

801
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,632
<i>into the future of
cyber-fighting.</i>

802
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:44,052
<i>Xao is a virtual
superhuman killing machine.</i>

803
01:07:44,053 --> 01:07:52,053
<i>Nothing in this tournament
is likely to stop him.</i>

804
01:08:07,785 --> 01:08:09,036
<i>For the three corporations</i>

805
01:08:09,037 --> 01:08:10,537
<i>remaining in the tournament,</i>

806
01:08:10,538 --> 01:08:12,873
<i>trillions of dollars
are on the line.</i>

807
01:08:12,874 --> 01:08:14,374
<i>With so much at stake,</i>

808
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,168
<i>tomorrow's bouts promise to be</i>

809
01:08:16,169 --> 01:08:18,503
<i>the greatest
battles of all time.</i>

810
01:08:18,504 --> 01:08:19,963
<i>Be there.</i>

811
01:08:19,964 --> 01:08:21,965
I want a guarantee that
chance won't get hurt.

812
01:08:21,966 --> 01:08:23,466
How can I do that, Jo?

813
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:24,886
I've only agreed
not to kill him.

814
01:08:26,512 --> 01:08:27,721
What control do I have if he

815
01:08:27,722 --> 01:08:29,764
continues fighting
in the tournament?

816
01:08:29,765 --> 01:08:31,516
Disqualify him or something.

817
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:33,768
It's your tournament.
It's your island.

818
01:08:33,769 --> 01:08:35,145
I'm sure you can
figure out a way.

819
01:08:35,146 --> 01:08:37,647
That would arouse suspicion, Jo.

820
01:08:37,648 --> 01:08:38,481
And I agree with you,

821
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:40,608
it's a surprise Mr. o'brien

822
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:41,735
has made it to the semi-finals,

823
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:43,695
but now if something
were to happen,

824
01:08:43,696 --> 01:08:45,155
the outcome would be
devastating to the tournament.

825
01:08:45,156 --> 01:08:47,741
Please. I've done all you asked.

826
01:08:47,742 --> 01:08:49,659
And more.

827
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,703
I don't want chance
to fight xao.

828
01:08:51,704 --> 01:08:52,704
Xao will kill him.

829
01:08:52,705 --> 01:08:54,706
Oh, put your mind at ease, Jo.

830
01:08:54,707 --> 01:08:56,541
I think it's very
unlikely Mr. o'brien

831
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:58,252
will reach a bout with xao.

832
01:08:58,253 --> 01:09:01,422
His opponent tomorrow
is formidable.

833
01:09:02,673 --> 01:09:06,634
Yeah, Mr. o'brien's
heroic march will end.

834
01:09:06,635 --> 01:09:09,055
- I'm sure of it.
- Thank you.

835
01:09:11,015 --> 01:09:12,391
Thank you? For what?

836
01:09:16,896 --> 01:09:18,730
Hey! Hey!

837
01:09:18,731 --> 01:09:20,899
Mr. tung would like to see you.

838
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,817
Just take a minute.

839
01:09:25,947 --> 01:09:26,947
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

840
01:09:26,948 --> 01:09:28,740
<i>Just relax! Relax.</i>

841
01:09:28,741 --> 01:09:30,076
<i>Hey, listen.</i>

842
01:09:31,953 --> 01:09:33,329
There you go, sir.

843
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:38,792
What the fuck is going on?

844
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:41,211
We are not to be seen together.

845
01:09:41,212 --> 01:09:43,713
I watched you today, Bradford.

846
01:09:43,714 --> 01:09:46,217
I don't know, you were
quite helpful to o'brien.

847
01:09:48,844 --> 01:09:51,972
I can't just do nothing.

848
01:09:51,973 --> 01:09:53,056
You told me to befriend him--

849
01:09:53,057 --> 01:09:54,934
But I didn't say
make him a winner.

850
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:01,231
Xao is a bit nervous
about o'brien, you see.

851
01:10:01,232 --> 01:10:02,608
They have this history.

852
01:10:06,237 --> 01:10:10,573
Look, chance is good,

853
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:11,908
but he's not all together.

854
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:13,952
You've seen to that.

855
01:10:13,953 --> 01:10:15,745
And he won't get any
cyber enhancements

856
01:10:15,746 --> 01:10:16,998
to overcome his injuries.

857
01:10:18,707 --> 01:10:20,416
I don't think xao should worry.

858
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:23,503
My thoughts exactly,
but xao would like

859
01:10:23,504 --> 01:10:25,880
to see him further handicapped,

860
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:29,009
and I'm inclined to agree
since there's no sense

861
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:31,262
of risking any
possibility of defeat.

862
01:10:36,058 --> 01:10:37,851
What do you have in mind?

863
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:41,271
During your match tomorrow,
injure him seriously.

864
01:10:41,272 --> 01:10:42,981
Easier said than done.

865
01:10:42,982 --> 01:10:44,525
Figure out a way, Bradford.

866
01:10:49,905 --> 01:10:51,072
I'm still supposed
to lose to him--

867
01:10:51,073 --> 01:10:53,825
Yes. Yes.

868
01:10:53,826 --> 01:10:55,994
A match between xao and o'brien

869
01:10:55,995 --> 01:10:58,330
is what we've
worked for, is it not?

870
01:10:58,331 --> 01:11:00,041
That's what you've worked for.

871
01:11:01,876 --> 01:11:06,921
Me, I expect you to
buy me out of my stocks.

872
01:11:06,922 --> 01:11:08,048
Loan the toma corporation

873
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:11,343
the two trillion dollars
you promised

874
01:11:11,344 --> 01:11:12,844
and get my father out of prison.

875
01:11:12,845 --> 01:11:14,304
The moment you injure o'brien

876
01:11:14,305 --> 01:11:16,557
and lose to him,
the deal is closed.

877
01:11:18,267 --> 01:11:19,726
If you screw me in any way--

878
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:21,812
You'll do what, Bradford?

879
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:26,942
You'll do what?

880
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:31,696
<i>I don't think your father</i>

881
01:11:31,697 --> 01:11:34,074
<i>would appreciate
any foolish acts.</i>

882
01:11:34,075 --> 01:11:36,327
Jail can be a dangerous place.

883
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:41,207
Things can happen.

884
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:46,462
He's looking good, isn't he?

885
01:11:52,093 --> 01:11:55,011
<i>Now we're down to our
last four competitors,</i>

886
01:11:55,012 --> 01:11:57,097
<i>and what a group they are.</i>

887
01:11:57,098 --> 01:11:59,682
<i>The greatest fighters
in the world today.</i>

888
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:01,935
<i>Xao has brutally destroyed</i>

889
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:04,438
<i>every opponent
he has faced so far.</i>

890
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:05,897
<i>All three have been killed,</i>

891
01:12:05,898 --> 01:12:07,565
<i>and with frightening ease.</i>

892
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:09,067
<i>Sianon has certainly done</i>

893
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:11,819
<i>a remarkable job with
xao's cyber implants.</i>

894
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,406
<i>They seem to be
far ahead of all the others.</i>

895
01:12:14,407 --> 01:12:17,075
<i>Xao's opponent, chung, has also</i>

896
01:12:17,076 --> 01:12:18,534
<i>cruised through his matches.</i>

897
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:20,787
<i>He is three for three in kills,</i>

898
01:12:20,788 --> 01:12:23,581
<i>but there are big questions
for chung in this match.</i>

899
01:12:23,582 --> 01:12:25,792
<i>Can his ruthless killer instinct</i>

900
01:12:25,793 --> 01:12:29,254
<i>and speed offset xao's
extraordinary power</i>

901
01:12:29,255 --> 01:12:31,132
<i>and relentless attack?</i>

902
01:12:34,093 --> 01:12:36,053
You're just a fucking tin man!

903
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:03,621
<i>I think he knows he's in
for the fight of his life.</i>

904
01:13:03,622 --> 01:13:06,542
<i>Xao's attack
appears unstoppable.</i>

905
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,398
<i>Chung can't seem
to find the answer.</i>

906
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:31,774
<i>Oh, my!</i>

907
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:33,901
<i>I've never seen anyone
do this to chung!</i>

908
01:13:33,902 --> 01:13:36,696
<i>Xao is handling him
with such ease,</i>

909
01:13:36,697 --> 01:13:38,072
<i>it's mind-boggling.</i>

910
01:13:38,073 --> 01:13:40,074
<i>Xao is toying with chung,</i>

911
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:41,202
<i>punishing him.</i>

912
01:14:40,386 --> 01:14:42,136
<i>He's literally tearing</i>

913
01:14:42,137 --> 01:14:44,347
<i>the flesh off
chung's cybergenics.</i>

914
01:14:44,348 --> 01:14:45,557
<i>That's it!</i>

915
01:14:45,558 --> 01:14:47,892
<i>Another impressive kill for xao.</i>

916
01:14:47,893 --> 01:14:50,061
<i>He moves into the
championship tomorrow,</i>

917
01:14:50,062 --> 01:14:52,188
<i>and as I check the sianon stock,</i>

918
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:54,232
<i>it is going through the roof.</i>

919
01:14:54,233 --> 01:14:56,859
<i>Success in the
market and the fact</i>

920
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,112
<i>that this tournament
has become the most</i>

921
01:14:59,113 --> 01:15:01,615
<i>widely watched event in history</i>

922
01:15:01,616 --> 01:15:05,286
<i>has to have the sianon
people ecstatic.</i>

923
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,611
<i>Stepping into the ring,</i>

924
01:15:39,612 --> 01:15:42,113
<i>world champion chance o'brien.</i>

925
01:15:42,114 --> 01:15:44,073
<i>And here comes his opponent,</i>

926
01:15:44,074 --> 01:15:48,161
<i>Bradford wharton of
the zanik toma corporation.</i>

927
01:15:48,162 --> 01:15:50,997
<i>The winner of this fight
advances into tomorrow's</i>

928
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:54,083
<i>championship bout
against xao of sianon.</i>

929
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:55,960
<i>We've observed
o'brien and wharton</i>

930
01:15:55,961 --> 01:15:57,878
<i>training together all week,</i>

931
01:15:57,879 --> 01:15:59,589
<i>and I'm sure all bets
and friendships</i>

932
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,509
<i>here are off in this
semi-final bout.</i>

933
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:05,219
<i>Both men have a tremendous
amount at stake.</i>

934
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:08,640
<i>O'brien, using a kickboxing
tae Kwon do style</i>

935
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:10,891
<i>punched up to
power shootfighting,</i>

936
01:16:10,892 --> 01:16:12,935
<i>while wharton favors a smoother,</i>

937
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:16,022
<i>softer aikido tamata style.</i>

938
01:16:16,023 --> 01:16:19,275
<i>Wharton is the matador,
o'brien the bull.</i>

939
01:16:19,276 --> 01:16:21,277
<i>Wharton the flashy showman,</i>

940
01:16:21,278 --> 01:16:23,614
<i>o'brien the blue collar warrior.</i>

941
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,999
<i>Oh, my! O'brien's hurt.</i>

942
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,460
<i>He's down! This could be over.</i>

943
01:16:37,461 --> 01:16:38,794
<i>All wharton needs to do</i>

944
01:16:38,795 --> 01:16:40,964
<i>is move in and finish o'brien.</i>

945
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:44,759
<i>But wharton seems to be
more preoccupied</i>

946
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,469
<i>with playing to the crowd.</i>

947
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,054
<i>This could be a giant mistake</i>

948
01:16:48,055 --> 01:16:49,973
<i>that wharton may regret.</i>

949
01:16:57,439 --> 01:16:59,982
<i>O'brien is up. Wharton has
missed a chance</i>

950
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:01,943
<i>for a quick end to this fight.</i>

951
01:17:18,669 --> 01:17:22,381
<i>O'brien is coming on strong.
He seems fully recovered.</i>

952
01:17:27,052 --> 01:17:31,138
<i>Oh, my! Wharton goes down
and he's out.</i>

953
01:17:31,139 --> 01:17:34,684
<i>O'brien wins! O'brien wins!</i>

954
01:17:34,685 --> 01:17:37,478
<i>Who would have thought a 100%</i>

955
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:39,606
<i>human could come this far?</i>

956
01:17:39,607 --> 01:17:41,567
Chance! Chance!

957
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:46,195
Now the world will see
who the real champion is.

958
01:17:46,196 --> 01:17:49,616
<i>So o'brien advances in a shocker</i>

959
01:17:49,617 --> 01:17:52,994
<i>to the championship
match against xao.</i>

960
01:18:23,191 --> 01:18:25,192
Next time you won't be so lucky.

961
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:27,487
You had a shot.
Why didn't you take it?

962
01:18:27,488 --> 01:18:28,613
Ah, you beat me fair and square.

963
01:18:28,614 --> 01:18:29,740
That's all there is to it.

964
01:18:33,327 --> 01:18:34,953
Someone put acid in my gloves.

965
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:43,210
You son of a bitch!

966
01:18:43,211 --> 01:18:45,588
You promised me chance
wouldn't fight xao.

967
01:18:45,589 --> 01:18:47,841
No, I said it was
highly unlikely--

968
01:18:47,842 --> 01:18:49,258
Well, forget it.
The deal is off.

969
01:18:49,259 --> 01:18:50,886
I'm telling xao what's going on.

970
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:04,398
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, come here.

971
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:06,442
I've looked for Jo everywhere.

972
01:19:06,443 --> 01:19:07,735
Have you seen her?

973
01:19:07,736 --> 01:19:09,112
As a matter of fact, I have.

974
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,159
<i>Look.</i>

975
01:19:20,499 --> 01:19:23,043
Hurt me and Jo dies.

976
01:19:25,713 --> 01:19:29,340
You get to kill
chance o'brien tomorrow.

977
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:31,051
That's not such
a bad thing, is it?

978
01:19:42,354 --> 01:19:45,314
Don't say anything.

979
01:19:45,315 --> 01:19:46,316
I have to.

980
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:52,446
Leave him.

981
01:19:52,447 --> 01:19:53,656
You have an
important fight tomorrow.

982
01:19:53,657 --> 01:19:54,657
Just concentrate on that.

983
01:20:08,088 --> 01:20:10,339
Looks like I fucked up again.

984
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:14,343
What the hell? What's going on?

985
01:20:14,344 --> 01:20:16,221
It's tung.

986
01:20:18,682 --> 01:20:20,641
He threatened to kill my father

987
01:20:20,642 --> 01:20:22,227
if I didn't help him.

988
01:20:25,606 --> 01:20:30,569
Tung promised xao
he could have Jo...

989
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:35,073
He could have Jo if he beat you.

990
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,812
- I want to see Jo.
- She's safe for now.

991
01:21:05,813 --> 01:21:08,564
You lose to xao today,
you get her back.

992
01:21:08,565 --> 01:21:10,608
<i>Put up a good fight,</i>

993
01:21:10,609 --> 01:21:13,904
the best you've
ever done, but lose.

994
01:21:15,697 --> 01:21:20,911
And if I don't think much
of the fight you put up...

995
01:21:23,538 --> 01:21:25,165
Jo dies.

996
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,877
Do we understand each other?

997
01:22:01,869 --> 01:22:04,745
So what is it now, Mr. tung?

998
01:22:04,746 --> 01:22:08,374
Gentlemen, tomorrow

999
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:10,793
the sianon corporation
will be crowned the greatest

1000
01:22:10,794 --> 01:22:13,338
bioengineering company
in the world.

1001
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:16,215
But how can you
guarantee success?

1002
01:22:16,216 --> 01:22:18,759
How can you be sure xao will not

1003
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,928
lose heart and match?

1004
01:22:20,929 --> 01:22:24,264
Well, it's true there
are many variables

1005
01:22:24,265 --> 01:22:26,017
in the sporting match.

1006
01:22:26,018 --> 01:22:27,852
Even with all his perfection,

1007
01:22:27,853 --> 01:22:30,354
<i>there are weaknesses.</i>

1008
01:22:30,355 --> 01:22:32,857
And how do you overcome that?

1009
01:22:32,858 --> 01:22:36,737
The only true advantage
the American has over us...

1010
01:22:38,864 --> 01:22:41,657
Is his emotional commitment.

1011
01:22:41,658 --> 01:22:44,244
We will give xao his own.

1012
01:22:47,831 --> 01:22:52,459
Mr. tung, if you fuck this up,

1013
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:55,004
I will have you gutted.

1014
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:56,131
Do you understand my meaning?

1015
01:23:01,636 --> 01:23:04,304
<i>What a match-up
for the championship.</i>

1016
01:23:04,305 --> 01:23:05,514
<i>Sianon couldn't have hoped</i>

1017
01:23:05,515 --> 01:23:08,768
<i>for a better ending to
this incredible tournament.</i>

1018
01:23:08,769 --> 01:23:10,853
<i>Xao, the sianon representative,</i>

1019
01:23:10,854 --> 01:23:12,521
<i>has clearly established</i>

1020
01:23:12,522 --> 01:23:15,733
<i>the superiority of
the sianon product line.</i>

1021
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:18,778
<i>Here comes xao.</i>

1022
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:20,738
<i>He is accompanied
by the head of marketing</i>

1023
01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:24,283
<i>for sianon, tung.
Also in xao's party,</i>

1024
01:23:24,284 --> 01:23:26,869
<i>o'brien's ex-manager, Jo Tobin.</i>

1025
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:29,496
<i>And now this is a surprise, liu,</i>

1026
01:23:29,497 --> 01:23:31,331
<i>Bradford wharton's assistant.</i>

1027
01:23:31,332 --> 01:23:33,417
<i>It seems everyone is
shifting over</i>

1028
01:23:33,418 --> 01:23:36,420
<i>to what is appearing
to be the winning team.</i>

1029
01:23:36,421 --> 01:23:38,923
<i>Xao's transformation
from a good fighter</i>

1030
01:23:38,924 --> 01:23:40,758
<i>to a competitor of this caliber</i>

1031
01:23:40,759 --> 01:23:42,843
<i>is truly extraordinary.</i>

1032
01:23:42,844 --> 01:23:44,470
<i>And for it all to come down</i>

1033
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:46,973
<i>to beating chance o'brien,</i>

1034
01:23:46,974 --> 01:23:49,016
<i>the reigning world champion,</i>

1035
01:23:49,017 --> 01:23:50,517
<i>the fighter considered</i>

1036
01:23:50,518 --> 01:23:52,145
<i>one of the greatest of all time</i>

1037
01:23:52,146 --> 01:23:55,815
<i>and the only 100% pure
human in the tournament.</i>

1038
01:23:55,816 --> 01:23:58,067
<i>What a story this has become.</i>

1039
01:23:58,068 --> 01:24:00,028
Chance! Chance!

1040
01:24:01,989 --> 01:24:03,906
<i>The last time these two men met</i>

1041
01:24:03,907 --> 01:24:06,408
<i>has no bearing on this
because xao</i>

1042
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:09,079
<i>just isn't the same fighter
he was back then.</i>

1043
01:24:10,538 --> 01:24:13,041
Don't make me use
the remote, Mr. o'brien.

1044
01:24:17,838 --> 01:24:19,047
Don't forget.

1045
01:24:22,634 --> 01:24:25,678
<i>It seems some words
are being exchanged,</i>

1046
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,764
<i>but the fighters move out
to the center of the ring.</i>

1047
01:24:28,765 --> 01:24:31,391
<i>There is no love lost
between these two,</i>

1048
01:24:31,392 --> 01:24:32,852
<i>certainly not for the defection</i>

1049
01:24:32,853 --> 01:24:36,522
<i>of o'brien's manager
to xao's camp.</i>

1050
01:24:36,523 --> 01:24:39,608
<i>This shapes up as
a fight with many aspects.</i>

1051
01:24:39,609 --> 01:24:41,735
<i>It's cyber versus human,</i>

1052
01:24:41,736 --> 01:24:45,239
<i>traditional kung fu against
high-tech shootfighting,</i>

1053
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,908
<i>and the past versus the future.</i>

1054
01:24:47,909 --> 01:24:54,832
<i>And we're just about
ready to get underway.</i>

1055
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:56,334
Fight!

1056
01:25:06,178 --> 01:25:09,513
<i>Here we go.
There's no holding back.</i>

1057
01:25:09,514 --> 01:25:11,891
<i>Both fighters are unloading
right from the top.</i>

1058
01:25:11,892 --> 01:25:13,684
<i>Can they keep this up?</i>

1059
01:25:13,685 --> 01:25:15,769
<i>Both men are
attacking relentlessly,</i>

1060
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:18,481
<i>trying to destroy one another
as quickly as possible.</i>

1061
01:25:21,693 --> 01:25:23,194
<i>There seems to be
something going on</i>

1062
01:25:23,195 --> 01:25:24,988
<i>between o'brien and tung.</i>

1063
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:14,411
<i>Oh, my! O'brien is
destroying xao.</i>

1064
01:26:14,412 --> 01:26:16,496
<i>He is using his
famous sudden strike</i>

1065
01:26:16,497 --> 01:26:19,000
<i>to rip xao's cybergenics apart.</i>

1066
01:26:21,002 --> 01:26:24,171
<i>Damn, liu has pulled a gun!</i>

1067
01:26:24,172 --> 01:26:25,715
<i>I don't know what this means!</i>

1068
01:26:44,109 --> 01:26:46,860
<i>Oh, my! Xao is down.</i>

1069
01:26:46,861 --> 01:26:48,112
<i>Incredible!</i>

1070
01:26:48,113 --> 01:26:49,947
<i>We'll have to see
how xao deals with this.</i>

1071
01:26:49,948 --> 01:26:53,075
<i>Sianon has to be concerned here.</i>

1072
01:26:53,076 --> 01:26:57,788
<i>It seems impossible,
but xao is down again.</i>

1073
01:26:57,789 --> 01:27:00,082
<i>Tung is stepping
out into the ring.</i>

1074
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:01,626
<i>He's got his gun on o'brien!</i>

1075
01:27:03,962 --> 01:27:05,587
<i>Here comes xao.</i>

1076
01:27:05,588 --> 01:27:09,926
<i>O'brien is on tung
and knocks out tung.</i>

1077
01:27:13,221 --> 01:27:15,764
<i>Christ! Xao has been shot!</i>

1078
01:27:15,765 --> 01:27:17,266
<i>Jo is struggling with liu.</i>

1079
01:27:17,267 --> 01:27:20,144
<i>Oh, my! What is going on?</i>

1080
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:23,273
<i>This is turning out to be
a disaster for sianon.</i>

1081
01:27:47,922 --> 01:27:51,926
Chance! Chance!
