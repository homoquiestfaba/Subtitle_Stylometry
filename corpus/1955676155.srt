1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,999
Settle. You said, "settle." Settle
for anything, and you're doomed.

2
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:07,998
My biggest fear is being mediocre.

3
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:11,998
We can't settle for anything,
especially for less than we deserve.

4
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:13,997
We watch other people live their dreams...

5
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:16,997
...instead of investing in our own.

6
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:18,996
We should strive for greatness.
Life is short.

7
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:20,996
We must make it extraordinary.

8
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:23,995
Never settle for anything
less than extraordinary...

9
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:25,995
...or else life will suck.

10
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:30,994
It might suck anyway, but it's better
to suck with integrity, right?

11
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:32,993
Trent?

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,993
Are you listening to me?

13
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:39,992
May we have the check, please?

14
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:51,978
I know, Mom. I know.

15
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,977
Never trust a man who doesn't
have eyes like Sinatra.

16
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,958
You know, it's all fun and games
until somebody loses an eye.

17
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,958
"There is no chance at all.

18
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,957
We are all trapped
by a singular fate.

19
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:37,957
No one ever finds the one."

20
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,956
- Oscar Wilde?
- Charles Bukowski.

21
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,955
Can't we ever start
the day with a positive vibe?

22
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:49,954
My dear cousin, what is the point
of getting our hopes up?

23
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,954
God forbid..

24
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:52,954
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:56,953
- Can't I have him for a while longer?
- I'm sorry, B.J.

26
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:59,952
Someone's gotta open the cafe, 
and it ain't gonna be me.

27
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:01,952
I can already hear your father downstairs.

28
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:03,952
I'm on my way.

29
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:17,949
Has anybody been in about the job?

30
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,948
With Frankie leaving in a few days,
we have to hire someone soon.

31
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:24,948
Somebody come in yesterday.
EntrevisteI interview him. You know what?

32
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:29,947
He ask me, "You gotta play
this garbage music all day?"

33
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:31,946
I say, "Yes."

34
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:33,946
He say, "Goodbye."
I say, "Va fangool".

35
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:38,945
So nobody comes. So what?
Got you, got me. Father, son.

36
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,944
We run the joint, right?

37
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:44,944
Someday you get yourself a nice wife.

38
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:45,943
I retire.

39
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:48,943
You need a good wife.
You know that, right?

40
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,942
- I'm too young to get married.
- What do you mean, "too young"?

41
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,942
I was half your age
when I marry your mama.

42
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:57,941
I was your age 
when your mama left me.

43
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,941
Maybe you're right.

44
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,940
No, I don't think you're right.
I think you need a girl.

45
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,939
When you gonna get yourself a girl?

46
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,939
I...

47
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,938
-  Well...
- Come on, Roberto.

48
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,937
I'm your papa. You can't 
talk to me, who you talk to?

49
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:16,937
All right.

50
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:18,937
I...

51
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:22,936
I have a girlfriend, Pop.

52
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:25,935
I wanted to keep it to myself,
but you got it out of me.

53
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:28,935
That's wonderful, 
wonderful, wonderful!

54
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,934
Who is she?

55
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:32,934
It's...

56
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,933
It's...

57
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:39,933
It's Allison, but don't say
anything because she's shy.

58
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,932
Okay, so just... Look, what do you
see? See, she's here to see me.

59
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:46,931
I just can't keep her away from me.

60
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,929
God, you're looking sexier
than ever, you know?

61
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:00,929
I've missed you, sweetcakes.

62
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:02,928
-  Are you all right?
-  Bear with me.

63
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:05,928
No, I'm never all right
without you, baby.

64
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:07,927
Okay.

65
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:15,926
Well... So has Miss Personality
emerged yet this morning?

66
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:17,925
She's still upstairs, honey.

67
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:28,923
Come here.

68
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:31,922
Oh, God.

69
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:35,922
Enter.

70
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,921
-  Hello, baby.
- Oh, hi. It's you.

71
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,920
Who were you expecting,
Jean-Claude Van Damme?

72
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
I'll be ready in a sec.

73
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,919
Baby, what is wrong
with Rob today?

74
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,918
He is acting semi-strange.

75
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:54,918
I know he's different,
but we love him just the same.

76
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,917
So how did it go last night?

77
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,917
Alli, I refuse to speak to you...

78
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:03,916
...unless you talk
in your God-given voice.

79
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,915
All right. I said, 
how did it go last night?

80
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:09,915
How did what go?

81
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:13,914
The date. The straight brother.
Play or pass?

82
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:15,914
Oh, that. Pass.

83
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:17,913
I can't believe you 
thought I'd like that guy.

84
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:20,913
He's so not my type.
Here, play with me.

85
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:23,912
- No, hate the game.
- Play!!

86
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:26,911
All right. What do you mean,
he's not your type?

87
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:29,911
He's smart. He's attractive.

88
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:32,910
He's a successful lawyer,
and he likes you.

89
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,910
What is your type?
Poor, ugly and stupid?

90
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,909
My type is indescribable,
but not him is a good start.

91
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,908
Frankie, you haven't had
a second date in over a year.

92
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:46,908
I think you should maybe
give this guy a chance.

93
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,907
Please, I'm not that desperate.  

94
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,907
He's sleazy, and he's arrogant.

95
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:53,906
And most importantly,
he has brown eyes.

96
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,906
Nobody told me
he had brown eyes.

97
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:59,905
- Prepare to be alone.
- What do I always say?

98
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:03,904
"Anything less than extraordinary
is a waste of my time."

99
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:06,904
If you know this, 
why do you set me up, ex-frat guys...

100
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,903
...with these six-figure,

101
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:10,903
..who could never know what I'm about?

102
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:15,902
You know what, honey? I just want you
to have a little fun. Is that a crime?

103
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:20,901
Fun is fleeting. It's pain that endures
and gives life its meaning.

104
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:22,900
All right. Very good.

105
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Come on, Gretzky. Audition.

106
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
- I'm dreading this.
- Really?

107
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,899
It's strange that you'd 
be dreading something.

108
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,897
- You sleep well?
- Of course not.

109
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:47,895
- I have an audition this morning..
- That's good.

110
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,895
And I have some errands that I have to run...

111
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,894
..so I'll be back around 3.

112
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:56,894
You take your time, bambina.

113
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:58,893
Don't take too much time, bambina...

114
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,893
...because I have plans
tonight, okay?

115
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,892
Okay, wish us luck
on our auditions

116
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:06,892
Okay, you break you legs,bambina.

117
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,891
I don't know why we're going
on this audition. The script sucks.

118
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,890
What on earth else are you gonna do?

119
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,890
Just try, please, and make
a good impression, okay?

120
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,889
You know, smile, look happy.

121
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,888
You just lost your button.

122
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:25,888
And be nice. There's the pretty.

123
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:27,888
Sweetheart, let me walk you out.

124
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,887
- Juice, see you later.
- Hey, Juice.

125
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:32,887
I'll be here.

126
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:36,886
- Okay, what is wrong with you?
- I need your help.

127
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:39,885
I kind of told my father
that we were... We were...

128
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:42,885
...well, seeing each other.

129
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:44,884
You what?

130
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,884
Isn't it getting a little stuffy
in that closet?

131
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:50,883
I'm not ready.
Please, can you go along with me?

132
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,882
He was questioning me.
He put me on the spot.

133
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,882
Are you crazy? No, I cannot lie.

134
00:09:55,882 --> 00:10:01,881
No. You say that it got too serious
and that we broke up.

135
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,880
Come on, this is not funny.

136
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
- I'm begging.
- It is funny.

137
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
You're gonna leave in a week.

138
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,879
Just think of this
as an acting exercise. Please.

139
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,879
For me.

140
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,878
Well, it would be a challenge
to see if I can pull it off, yeah?

141
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:19,877
I will be your slave for life.

142
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:23,876
Is it just me or are we having
a Brady Bunch moment here?

143
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,876
- All right.
- It might be you.

144
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,875
Thank you.

145
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:56,870
- Hi, what can I get for you?
- Actually, I'm here about the job.

146
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,869
- Is that still available?
- No, we...

147
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,869
I'm kidding. One second.

148
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:06,868
Hey, Papa. Papa,
someone's here about the job.

149
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,867
My father will talk to you.
He runs the place.

150
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,867
- Sir. Can I help you?
- Yes, sir. I hope so.

151
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:17,866
I'm just new here in town,
and I'm looking for a job.

152
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:22,865
- What do you know about coffee?
- Well, I know how to make coffee.

153
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,864
- I mean, to be honest with you...
- How many years are you?

154
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,864
- 24. I just graduated....
- Are you Italian?

155
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,863
No. Is that required?

156
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,861
Grazie</i>, Angelica. It's about time.

157
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,860
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

158
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,859
It's me and my sister.
We have a conversation.

159
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:53,859
- What did you say your name was?
- Sir, David Shrader, sir.

160
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,858
Tell you what I'm gonna do,
Sir David Shrader.

161
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,857
I'll give you the job, 
but don't let me down.

162
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:00,857
No, sir.

163
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:04,856
All right. Listen, why don't I
show you around today?

164
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,856
We'll get you acquainted
with everything.

165
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,856
And you can start tomorrow.

166
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:09,855
Yeah, that'd be great.

167
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,855
- I'm Rob.
- David.

168
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:12,855
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

169
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:19,853
- So where'd you say you were from?
- Michigan.

170
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:21,853
What brings you to San Francisco?

171
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:23,853
Writing, hopefully.

172
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:25,852
Lots of writers seem to like it here.

173
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:29,851
All right, here I go.

174
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,851
Well?

175
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,851
Not bad for your first one.

176
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,850
At least I'll finally get a day off now.

177
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,850
So you pretty much run
this place yourself?

178
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:40,849
Yeah, pretty much.
It's...

179
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:44,848
My cousin, Frankie, works here too,
when it's convenient for her.

180
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,848
She's an actress and she's moving
to L.A. next week.

181
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,847
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's her.

182
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,847
And that's her too,
when she was a kid.

183
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:55,846
Oh, okay.

184
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:57,846
- This...
- What?

185
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,846
Are you guys related to Sinatra
or something?

186
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,845
No, Frankie's father was a musician...

187
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,844
...and they played together
for a long time, so...

188
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:11,843
Top of the day to you, my darling.

189
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:12,843
- Hi.
- Hi.

190
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:13,843
I'm Allison.

191
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:15,842
I'm the love of Rob's life.

192
00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:18,842
- How am I doing so far?
- Great, but Leo left.

193
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:22,841
This is David. We just hired him
so don't scare him away.

194
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:27,840
She's pretending to be my girlfriend.
My father doesn't know I'm gay, so....

195
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,839
Oh. Well, that's...
I mean, bravo.

196
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,839
I didn't know you were gay.

197
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,838
See? Now who's scaring him away?

198
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:37,838
Nobody's scaring me away.

199
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:39,838
Hi, Allison. Are you from Ireland?

200
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:43,837
No. Pacific Heights actually,
but thank you very much.

201
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,836
- Another actress, this one.
- Okay.

202
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,836
You don't have to hang out.
Come back tomorrow at 10...

203
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,835
...and we'll start you up.
- Yeah, okay. That works.

204
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:55,834
Actually, I don't know
many people here yet.

205
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,834
I appreciate the job.

206
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,834
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.

207
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,833
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

208
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,832
Oh, he seems nice.
Don't you think?

209
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:11,831
I'm certainly not gonna mind
looking at him every day.

210
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,828
Cookie moment.

211
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:29,828
Thank you.

212
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:42,825
You're relatively talented. The
audition couldn't have gone that bad.

213
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:45,825
Forget the audition.
The audition was fine.

214
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:46,824
But?

215
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:49,824
But they wanted more copies
of my resume.

216
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:53,823
Do you know what that means?
Twenty-four hour copy shop from hell.

217
00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:56,822
Know how disgruntled workers
shoot people in the post office?

218
00:14:57,822 --> 00:14:59,822
This place is next.
It's out of control.

219
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,821
The lines are three miles long.

220
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:05,821
The manager doesn't know what a
laser printer is. Broken machines!

221
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,820
"Oh, I'm sorry. We're out
of recycled paper, ma'am.

222
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Can you pick it up tomorrow?
Bathroom?

223
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,819
The bathroom's broken, but there's
a 7-Eleven down the street.

224
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,819
And haven't I seen you
somewhere before?"

225
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:18,818
"No, never."
"I'm sure I have."

226
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,817
"Trust me. You haven't. Your eyes are
green, and you smell like Jovan musk!"

227
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:25,817
Caffeine is a drug!

228
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:29,816
I got one word for you:
NyQuil. Maybe?

229
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,815
I just remembered something.

230
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,815
Last night I had this dream
that we were on our way to L.A

231
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:37,814
I was tired and wanted to sleep.
You wouldn't let me...

232
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,814
...so you put toothpicks in my eyes
to keep them open.

233
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,813
You know, like Bugs Bunny.

234
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:45,813
My eyes were all watery
and bloodshot when I woke up.

235
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,812
Scared of that.

236
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:51,811
I dreamt last night that Friedrich
Nietzsche was whispering in my ear.

237
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:54,811
He kept saying, "All men
are inherently evil.

238
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:57,810
- All men are inherently evil."
- Oh, you are so dark.

239
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,810
- What do you mean you dreamed that?
- I'm not dark. I'm realistic.

240
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,809
How do you dream
if you don't sleep?

241
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,809
Well, I was napping then, okay?

242
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,808
I'm not sleep-deprived.
I'm just sleep-deficient.

243
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,808
You are not realistic. You are cynical.

244
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:12,807
I have high standards.

245
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,807
VYou're a realistic idealist.

246
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,806
No, but dreams happen in REM.
REM is deep sleep.

247
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,806
You don't sleep long enough
to reach that stage.

248
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:22,805
You must hallucinate.

249
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:26,805
See, your problem is, you will
not compromise what you want.

250
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:29,804
What I want...
It doesn't exist.

251
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:34,803
I read that sleep deprivation causes
hallucinations. I read that.

252
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,803
Acid causes hallucination.

253
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:40,802
Oh, my God. I'm not on acid,
and I'm not hallucinating.

254
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:41,802
I am not sleep-deprived.

255
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:45,801
Insomnia is not a total lack of sleep.
It's poor sleep.

256
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,800
You're not even looking
for Mr. Right.

257
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
You won't give any poor guy
a chance.

258
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,799
Well, a watched pot never boils.

259
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,799
You've got to at least turn
the stove on.

260
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,798
Then you get burned.

261
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,798
Dreams, as we know them,
they don't exist for you, Frankie.

262
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:05,797
- And you care because...?
- Because I'm writing a book, maybe?

263
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:08,796
Does anyone wanna know how
my audition went today? Anyone?

264
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,796
I've got ice-cream headache.

265
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,796
Coffee, anyone?

266
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:14,795
I'll take some if you're getting up.

267
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:17,794
It was fine. It was really great.
I did really well.

268
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:21,794
- I might have a career.
- Where are you going?

269
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:24,793
- My mother needs the car.
- Wait until Leo gets back...

270
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,793
...because I want him to see
us leave together.

271
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:28,792
You're kidding.

272
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:31,792
- How about a kiss?
- Yeah, with tongue.

273
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:32,791
Do it.

274
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,791
You know, you're sickos, all of you.
You're all just...

275
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,790
- Is everyone deserting me?
- Everyone but me.

276
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,789
Oh, thank God.

277
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,789
Rob, what time do I have
to work tomorrow?

278
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:48,788
10. I forgot to tell you.
We hired a new guy today.

279
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:50,788
Leo wants you to break him in.

280
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:54,787
Why do I have to break in the rookie?

281
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,786
He's harmless. I told him you guys
would get along great.

282
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,786
Don't hold your breath.

283
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:01,786
There, see? Cynical.

284
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:03,785
What?

285
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,785
What is he like? Is he cute?

286
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,784
Yeah. Probably not your type.

287
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:13,783
Great. And I'm stuck with him all day.

288
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:15,783
I already showed him how
to do everything.

289
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:18,782
He just moved here
and doesn't know anybody.

290
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:20,782
So would you try to just
be nice, okay?

291
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:23,781
Why is everyone always telling me
to be nice?

292
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:26,781
Why? Let's see...

293
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,759
This better be useful
and pertinent to my life.

294
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:20,758
Always.

295
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:24,757
"In order to win, you must expect
to win." Dan Fouts.

296
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,757
Francesca, is that idealism I hear?

297
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:29,756
Of course not.

298
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:32,756
Dan Fouts was a good quarterback
who never won a Super Bowl.

299
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:34,755
Point being?

300
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:39,754
Point being, a positive attitude does
not always guarantee success.

301
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,754
Just when I thought you were
beginning to lighten up.

302
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:46,753
Cheerio! Speaking of lightening up,
Francesca...

303
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:48,753
...did I mention I was having
my rib removed?

304
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:52,752
I'll be at supermodel status before
you can even think about it.

305
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:57,751
Step aside, Cindy, because there is
a new sheriff in town.

306
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,750
He goes by the name of B.J.

307
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,750
All right. All right.
I'll see you guys later.

308
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,747
Juice, you scared me.

309
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:16,747
Where's the new dude?

310
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:20,746
He's got 10 minutes to get here,
or he's out of a job.

311
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,745
Scared of that. I'll point him out
when he gets here.

312
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:26,745
Your cappuccinos.

313
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:02,738
Frankie, right?

314
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:07,737
Hi. David Shrader.

315
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:12,736
Sir David Shrader? The rookie?

316
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:16,735
That's what you call me
behind my back?

317
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:20,734
How did you know who I was?

318
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,734
I recognized you from your picture.

319
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:28,733
You don't look quite as ethnic
as this place implies.

320
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:32,732
Oh, well, my father wasn't even Italian.

321
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:35,731
Sinatra just kind of went to his head.

322
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:39,731
I know. Rob told me
all about you yesterday.

323
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,730
Don't believe anything he said.

324
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,730
No, don't worry.
He's a fan, you know?

325
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,729
He said you were a little
on the dark side...

326
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,729
...but that you always aim at the good.

327
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:53,728
"Every action and pursuit is thought
to aim at some good...

328
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:56,727
The good has rightly been declared
to be...

329
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:59,727
...that at which all things aim."

330
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:03,726
Not so easy to quote Aristotle off
the top of your head. I'm impressed.

331
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,725
It's not so easy to recognize Aristotle
off the top of your head.

332
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:12,724
"Knowledge comes,
but wisdom lingers."

333
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,724
Tennyson.

334
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:16,723
Have I met my match?

335
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:19,723
No one's been able to stump me yet.

336
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:20,723
Well, me neither.

337
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:21,722
Is that a challenge?

338
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:24,722
For you.

339
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:30,721
"I am now a central part
of your mind's landscape...

340
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:34,720
...whether you care or do not."

341
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,719
Morrissey, Steven.

342
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,718
"I am troubled immeasurably
by your eyes.

343
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:44,718
I am struck by the feather
of your soft reply.

344
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:48,717
The sound of glass speaks
quick disdain...

345
00:23:49,717 --> 00:23:51,716
...and conceals what your eyes
fight to explain."

346
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:56,715
Morrison, Jim.

347
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:05,714
"The lady will have the linguini
with clam sauce and a Coke, no ice.

348
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:09,713
Remember, wherever you are,
that's the place to be.

349
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:12,712
Isn't this great?"

350
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:17,711
Damone, Fast times.

351
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:22,710
"I'll be taking these Huggies and
whatever cash you got in the register."

352
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,710
Raising Arizona. 

353
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,709
Hey, Frankie!

354
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:30,709
That's him. That's the new guy.

355
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,708
Thanks, Juice.
Way to be on the ball there.

356
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,707
He's the resident slacker of the cafe.

357
00:24:38,707 --> 00:24:41,706
He never pays for anything,
just so you know.

358
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:43,706
Juice, say hi to David.

359
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:44,706
Hey, David.

360
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:46,705
Did she tell you not to charge me?

361
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:49,705
Yes, I told him.

362
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,704
It's because I'm a unique
and talented individual.

363
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:56,704
- He's a musician.
- An artist!

364
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:58,703
How do you like it here so far?

365
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:01,703
I'm immensely entertained.

366
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:07,701
Good, because we like everybody
to feel like part of the family.

367
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:08,701
- Welcome to Cafe Blue Eyes.
- Thank you.

368
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:14,700
Frankie, are we still playing
Scrabble tonight?

369
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,699
Yeah, Rob's place. 11:30.

370
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:21,699
Is he a relative too?

371
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:24,698
No. You know how Italians are.

372
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:28,697
Anyone whose last name ends
in a vowel is indirectly related.

373
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,697
That's a great line!
That's really...

374
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:34,696
Can I borrow that? I'd start
a chapter with it or something.

375
00:25:34,696 --> 00:25:35,696
Are you a writer?

376
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:39,695
I'm working on it.
You're an actress, I hear.

377
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:42,694
Yeah, I'm working on that.

378
00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:44,694
- I'd love to read some of your stuff.
- Really?

379
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:46,694
Yeah, if you have some.

380
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:51,693
Yeah. Sure.

381
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:54,692
Great.

382
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:56,692
Hey, do you play Scrabble?

383
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:59,691
Do I play...?

384
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,690
C-A-Z-l-Q-U-E. Cazique. That's the
highest-scoring word known to man.

385
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,689
Good, because Rob's having
a game later.

386
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:10,689
He lives next door,
if you wanna come.

387
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:13,688
And bring some of your work
for me to read.

388
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:17,687
Yeah. Okay, yeah, that sounds
great actually.

389
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,687
Great.

390
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:21,687
Great.

391
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:26,686
You have to allow an artist to express
themselves as they choose to.

392
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,685
As long as the honesty is there,
and they both do that.

393
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:32,684
Well, that's where I tend
to disagree with you.

394
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:36,684
Well, that's where your reasoning
ability is broken down.

395
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:38,683
- Would somebody back me up here?
- I will.

396
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:40,683
She's right, Juice.

397
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:44,682
Eddie Vedder is very much
like Bono was a decade ago.

398
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:45,682
It's the passion.

399
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:48,681
But Eddie Vedder will never
turn into the spectacle...

400
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:50,681
...that Bono has become.

401
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:52,681
Who's Eddie Vetter?

402
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:55,680
Vedder. D, sweetheart. Two of them.

403
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,679
All right. Easy, Crusher.

404
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,679
Please don't talk like that about Bono.

405
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,678
You wanna talk voice of a generation,
let's talk Michael Stipe.

406
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:06,678
They all belong in the same category.

407
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:08,677
It's a hierarchy.

408
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:11,677
What do you mean by "hierarchy"?

409
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:16,676
It's like a trinity. If Bono is God,
then Eddie would be Jesus.

410
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,675
But why is Bono God?
Why can't Eddie be God?

411
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:20,675
Bono's older.

412
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:22,675
Right. God came first.

413
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,674
Right.

414
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:30,673
Well, so if it's the trinity,
then who's the Holy Spirit?

415
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,672
The man, Sinatra. Who else?

416
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:36,672
Scared of that.

417
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:37,672
Excuse me.

418
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:39,671
Yes B.J.?

419
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:43,670
I'm sorry, but that just
does not work for me.

420
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,670
Well, Benny, in this family
Sinatra is God, so...

421
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,669
I don't know why you stick up
for that...

422
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,669
...whiskey-drinking old geezer
all the time.

423
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:58,667
Because he happens to have
the eyes of an angel.

424
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,667
And he gave my father a job,
when no one else would.

425
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,666
David, you better hide your letters.
I tend to glance.

426
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,666
I think we're getting
off the point. Frankie.

427
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,665
What is the point?

428
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:13,664
The point is, if A and B,
then C.

429
00:28:13,664 --> 00:28:16,664
Bono's lost his integrity.
Vedder hasn't and won't.

430
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:20,663
Thus, Vedder is God. Period.

431
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:23,663
"Worship the music, not
the musicians." Vedder said that.

432
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:25,662
- I read that interview.
- You did?

433
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,662
- It was really good.
- It was great.

434
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:32,661
Oh, God, I am so, so over
this conversation.

435
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:38,660
I have lost the will to spell, and I have
no idea what just transpired.

436
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,659
- I'm quitting.
- I gotta go too.

437
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:43,659
Oh, here.

438
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:47,658
- I know, I'm so sick of Chinese food.
- Lf you get a chance. Enjoy.

439
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:50,657
Hold it. Who's gonna
take home that dip?

440
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:25,650
Fuck!

441
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:50,645
One coffee for you.

442
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:55,644
- Can I get one of those?
- Yeah.

443
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:59,643
With the PowerBar,
we're looking at $2.99.

444
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,642
You said Frankie was working.

445
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:11,641
She is. She's still upstairs,
taking her time, no doubt.

446
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,641
She'll be here pretty much
all day then?

447
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:17,640
I imagine you'll be seeing quite a bit
of her before she leaves.

448
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,639
- When does she leave again?
- In three fun-filled days.

449
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:24,639
Sorry I'm late.

450
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:28,638
Hey, stinko.

451
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:32,637
Hi.

452
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:33,637
Hi.

453
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:35,636
Hi.

454
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:36,636
Hi.

455
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:37,636
Hi.

456
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,635
You slept in today. Are you sick
or something?

457
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,635
Sick? Do I look sick?

458
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:49,634
No, I'm... I'm not sick.
I'm... What's the word?

459
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,633
- Horny?
- Roberto!

460
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,633
You watch your tongue.

461
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:58,632
What kind of language is that?

462
00:30:58,632 --> 00:30:59,632
Yeah.

463
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:02,631
I hope you no talk like that
around your girlfriend.

464
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:04,631
- Yeah.
- I no teach you that.

465
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:07,630
Trust me, I'm as polite as they come.

466
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,630
Are you ready to go?

467
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:14,629
Francesca.

468
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:17,628
Sir David.

469
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:20,627
You take care, okay?
We'll be gone a couple hours.

470
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:22,627
What is this? Father-and-son day?

471
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,627
Miniature golf.

472
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:26,626
Oh, how cute.

473
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:29,626

474
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,625
Roberto!

475
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:36,624
First, I'm gonna wash your mouth out
good this time. Get over here!

476
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:42,623
Good morning.

477
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:50,622
Well, well, well. Aren't we
the little Renaissance man?

478
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:51,621
Pardon me?

479
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:53,621
I read your stuff. It's very brilliant.

480
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,620
All of it? You read all of this last night?

481
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Yeah. I don't sleep much.

482
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,619
I kind of have insomnia.
It gave me something to do.

483
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:10,618
Well, thanks.

484
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:12,617
What?

485
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:13,617
- Nothing.
- What?

486
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:17,616
- Nothing.
- No, tell me. What?

487
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:21,615
It's... It's just, that's it.

488
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:24,615
- What's it?
- That.

489
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:26,614
It.

490
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:31,613
The stuff you read. That's old.
I haven't finished anything in a year.

491
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:35,613
And I'm starting to think
that I have nothing left.

492
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:42,611
And she's amused
by my lack of inspiration.

493
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,611
- Mr. Shrader.
- Yes?

494
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:49,610
"Inspiration is a treasure chest buried
at the bottom of the sea of your soul."

495
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:54,609
Well, I must have lost my map.

496
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:58,608
And you're a man, so God forbid
you stop and ask for directions.

497
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:00,608
Never.

498
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:02,607
Well, it's a good thing
you met me then.

499
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,607
Oh, it is?

500
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:08,606
This town is filled with precious jewels
of inspiration.

501
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,606
You have to know where to look.

502
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:13,605
And what are you? My compass?

503
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:14,605
Is that so unreasonable?

504
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:19,604
"The reasonable man adapts himself
to the world.

505
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:22,603
The unreasonable man persists
in trying to adapt the world to himself.

506
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:27,602
Therefore, all progress depends
on the unreasonable man."

507
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:31,602
- You think you got me on that one.
- Yes, I do.

508
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:36,601
For an intelligent guy, it's very foolish
to quote a great writer...

509
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:39,600
...being that you're
a great writer yourself.

510
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,599
- Who is George Bernard Shaw.
- Oh, she's so smart.

511
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,599
- I study the Trivial Pursuit cards.
- And so clever.

512
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,598
I lie awake at night thinking
of clever things to say.

513
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:52,597
And always has to have
the last word.

514
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,597
Thank God for caffeine.

515
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:58,596
You really don't sleep much, do you?

516
00:33:59,596 --> 00:34:01,596
No, I really don't.

517
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:05,595
You're serious? Is it...?
Is it, like, a chronic thing?

518
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:07,594
Kind of.

519
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:10,594
I doze off for short periods
of time during the night...

520
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:16,593
...but I haven't slept a full eight hours
since I was 6 years old.

521
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:17,592
Why 6?

522
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:21,592
Because that's when my parents died.

523
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:23,591
I'm sorry.

524
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:28,590
They were killed in a car accident.
Leo and I were there too.

525
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,590
And what? You still have nightmares?

526
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,589
No, not really.

527
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:42,587
When I was little, my parents used to
put me to sleep singing lullabies.

528
00:34:43,587 --> 00:34:46,587
You know, Sinatra songs, of course.

529
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:49,586
They used to just sit at the edge
of my bed...

530
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:52,585
...and sing till their heart's content.

531
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:58,584
I remember them looking down at me
for what seemed like forever.

532
00:34:58,584 --> 00:35:04,583
They would smile at each other, then
back at me, then at each other.

533
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,582
There was just a lot of love
in the room, you know?

534
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:11,582
And after they died,
I used to dream that scene.

535
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:15,581
That they were singing me to sleep,
that they were alive.

536
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:22,580
And I'd wake up, and I'd remember
that they were gone.

537
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,579
And it was so hard for me
to lose them again...

538
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:28,578
...that I trained myself to stay awake.

539
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:31,578
And I haven't had
a good night's sleep since.

540
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:37,577
After all this time...

541
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:42,576
...do you ever think that maybe
it's in your head, the insomnia?

542
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:47,575
Well, isn't your writer's block
all in your head?

543
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,574
Indirectly, I guess.

544
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:54,573
Of course it is. You can't
force either one of them.

545
00:35:54,573 --> 00:35:58,572
Inevitably you try, but it's like
a surfer waiting for a wave.

546
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:00,572
You just have
to let it come to you.

547
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:05,571
Well, since you're
the self-proclaimed map...

548
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:09,570
...to my destination,
I guess I have to be yours.

549
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,570
You think you can
put me to sleep?

550
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,569
You think you could
inspire me to write?

551
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:17,569
I know I can.

552
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,568
Okay, then.

553
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:25,567
Starting now,
we're both on a quest.

554
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:31,566
- You're gonna do that for me?
- That's what friends are for, right?

555
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:36,565
I haven't made a friend since Juice
stole Alli's lunch box in 4th grade.

556
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:40,564
- To friends.
- To friends. And I'll take that. Thanks.

557
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,564
- Excuse me?
- I'm cutting off the supply.

558
00:36:42,564 --> 00:36:45,563
All you drink is coffee.
You got a gang of coffee over there.

559
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:49,562
You drink an awful lot of coffee.
You put coffee in your coffee.

560
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:52,562
- So?
- So coffee has caffeine.

561
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:56,561
Has it ever occurred to you
that might be part of your problem?

562
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,561
I didn't drink coffee when I was 6.

563
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Okay, okay.
Bear with me here.

564
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
We're gonna detox you.

565
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:07,559
I want you to have a glass
of warm milk before you go to bed.

566
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,558
No, no. That's a fallacy.
I've tried that.

567
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:14,557
- Humor me, okay?
- Okay.

568
00:37:14,557 --> 00:37:18,557
I don't wanna hear complaining
when I keep you out till dawn.

569
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:20,556
This is 50-50, remember?

570
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:23,556
- Of course.
- Of course.

571
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:30,554
Okay, I'm ready.

572
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,553
- Hop in.
- Okay.

573
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:59,548
You're not gonna make me drink any
more warm, white liquids, are you?

574
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:02,548
No.

575
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,547
You tired?

576
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:06,547
No.

577
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:13,546
David, do you have
any brothers or sisters?

578
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:15,545
Yeah. One sister.

579
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:17,545
- Older or younger?
- Older.

580
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,544
- Are you close to her?
- Yeah, we're pretty close.

581
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:24,543
What are your parents like?

582
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,542
They're just your basic
generic mom and dad.

583
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,542
Are you close to them?

584
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,541
Probably not as close
as I should be.

585
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,541
Did you have a dog
when you were growing up?

586
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,540
- A sandbox?
- No sandbox. I had a basketball hoop.

587
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,539
Were you on the Little League?

588
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:50,538
Is this The Barbara Walters Special?

589
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,538
I just want to know...

590
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:56,537
where you came from.

591
00:38:57,537 --> 00:39:00,536
Your parents must be
really proud of you.

592
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:02,536
You think so?

593
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:04,536
Yeah, I think so.

594
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:07,535
You think too much.
That's why you can't sleep.

595
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,535
Stop thinking.

596
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:11,534
Okay.

597
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:19,533
- Now what?
- Now lay back.

598
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:21,532
Shut your eyes.

599
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,531
Everywhere
Creatures are falling asleep...

600
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,530
The collapsible frink
Just collapsed in a heap

601
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,529
And by adding the frink
To the others before

602
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:38,529
I am able to give you
The who's-asleep score

603
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:42,528
Right now, 40, 40 4
Creatures are happily

604
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:43,528
Deeply in slumber.

605
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:45,527
I think you'll agree
That's a whopping fine number...

606
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:47,527
Go to sleep!

607
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:50,526
Come on. Help me out.

608
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:55,525
Counting up sleepers
Just how do we do it? 

609
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:58,525
It's really quite simple
There's nothing much to it

610
00:39:58,525 --> 00:40:00,524
By an audio...

611
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,524
Telio Tallyho count.

612
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:05,523
On a mountain halfway
Between Reno and Rome

613
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,523
We have a machine
In a Plexiglas dome...

614
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:11,522
Which listens and looks
Into everyone's home

615
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:13,522
And whenever it sees
A new sleeper go flop...

616
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:17,521
It jiggles and lets
A new biggle-ball drop

617
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:21,520
Our chap counts these balls
As they plop in a cup

618
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,519
And that's how we know
Who is down and who's up.

619
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:11,510
Good morning, sunshine.

620
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,510
Morning.

621
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,509
Morning.
Shit! I gotta go.

622
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:21,508
What's the matter?
Do you have a date?

623
00:41:21,508 --> 00:41:24,508
No. We'll talk tomorrow.
I'm working, remember?

624
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:27,507
Well, what about me?
I'm wide awake.

625
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:29,507
I know. I'm sorry.

626
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:32,506
I fell asleep.
The book put me out.

627
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:34,506
All right. Go home
and get some rest.

628
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:37,505
I will. Okay,
I'll see you tomorrow.

629
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:39,505
David, wait!

630
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:43,504
It is tomorrow.

631
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:47,503
Well, then, I'll see you later.

632
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:53,502
Good. That makes it seem sooner.

633
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,500
- Penny for your thoughts, Francesca?
- Is that all they're worth?

634
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,499
With all the money he charges me
on bagels, I know he can afford more.

635
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:12,498
- Did you pay for those, ass?
- Tab.

636
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,498
- I feel like he's holding out on me.
- Who, David?

637
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:18,497
Who else?

638
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:22,496
You've known each other
a couple days. You want a ring?

639
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:25,496
He probably doesn't
want to get too attached.

640
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:29,495
- I mean, you are leaving.
- Thank you, Scarlett.

641
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:32,494
But he could be a writer anywhere.
He could come with me.

642
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:35,494
What? And then just sort of
pack up and move again?

643
00:42:35,494 --> 00:42:38,493
People have done
crazier things for love.

644
00:42:38,493 --> 00:42:41,493
- Honey, you are such a romantic.
- Right.

645
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:46,492
- Maybe he's gay.
- He's not gay, Juice.

646
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:48,491
My, my,
I do not think he's gay.

647
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:50,491
No. All I'm saying is,
maybe he's gay.

648
00:42:51,491 --> 00:42:54,490
- He's not gay!
- I really don't think he's gay.

649
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,490
Rob will know.

650
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,489
Rob, do you think
David could be gay?

651
00:43:07,487 --> 00:43:11,487
- No, he is not gay.
- How do you know?

652
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,486
Because he wears running shoes
with jeans. And I asked him.

653
00:43:15,486 --> 00:43:18,485
What? What did you do?

654
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:21,485
- You just asked him?
- Scared of that.

655
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:23,484
What did you say?

656
00:43:23,484 --> 00:43:25,484
I said, "Do you play polo?"

657
00:43:25,484 --> 00:43:28,483
What do you think I said?
I said, "Are you a gay?"

658
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:31,483
I mean, what?
He's a cute guy, I guess.

659
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:35,482
- You are such a little flirt.
- What did he say?

660
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:38,481
He said,
"Straight as an arrow."

661
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:42,480
He said that?
He is so witty.

662
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,480
- Don't worry. He likes you.
- Wait! How do you know?

663
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,479
Because he talks about you
all the time...

664
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:53,478
...brings you up in conversation,
asks questions, from day one.

665
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:56,478
Well, then, what's the problem?

666
00:43:56,478 --> 00:43:59,477
Honey, maybe he's shy.
You don't know.

667
00:43:59,477 --> 00:44:01,477
Maybe he's nervous.

668
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:05,476
- Maybe he's impotent.
- Maybe he's a Republican.

669
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,476
Maybe he's an escaped convict.

670
00:44:07,476 --> 00:44:10,475
Maybe we should stop,
because here he comes.

671
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:12,475
Oh, my, my, my.

672
00:44:13,474 --> 00:44:15,474
Hi, David!

673
00:44:15,474 --> 00:44:17,474
Hi, gang. Hi.

674
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:19,473
Hi.

675
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:21,473
Hi.

676
00:44:21,473 --> 00:44:26,472
- So how'd you sleep last night?
- Pretty well. I didn't get... Sorry.

677
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:29,471
- I didn't, really.
- No?

678
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,471
Try this.
That'll help, hopefully.

679
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:35,470
- You working today?
- Eventually.

680
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:35,458
Molly!

681
00:45:39,457 --> 00:45:43,457
Hi. I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

682
00:45:43,457 --> 00:45:45,456
You forgot your keys.

683
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:48,456
No. Come on in.

684
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:53,455
Guys.

685
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:56,454
This...

686
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,454
This is my girlfriend.

687
00:46:02,453 --> 00:46:05,452
Hi. Molly Munday.
Nice to meet you.

688
00:46:08,452 --> 00:46:11,451
Molly, this is...

689
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:14,450
Juice and Allison, Rob...

690
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,450
...and this is Frankie.

691
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:22,449
I've heard a lot about all of you.

692
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:25,448
I wish we could
say the same about you.

693
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:30,447
So, Molly, darling,
what an interesting name.

694
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:31,447
Where are you from?

695
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,446
Oakland, actually.

696
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:37,446
Yeah, I'm a local girl.

697
00:46:40,445 --> 00:46:42,445
I went to school in Michigan.

698
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:46,444
That's where David and I met.

699
00:46:48,444 --> 00:46:52,443
Molly's in law school here in town.

700
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:56,442
Really? Well, great.
That's just great.

701
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:00,441
Yeah, how about that? A lawyer
and a writer in one house.

702
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:04,440
That's very, very
impressive, isn't it?

703
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,440
Anyone?

704
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,440
Anyone?

705
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:13,439
Bueller?

706
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:16,438
You have a very talented
boyfriend, Molly.

707
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:21,437
Don't tell him that.
He'll never get a real job.

708
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:31,435
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt.

709
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:34,435
- I just came by to drop these off.
- Thanks, I'm...

710
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:38,434
I'll be in the library all night.
I've got an exam tomorrow...

711
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:41,433
...so don't be alarmed
if you don't see me till then.

712
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:45,432
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thanks. I love you. Bye.

713
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,430
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go pack.

714
00:48:10,427 --> 00:48:12,427
So...

715
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:15,426
...how about those Niners, huh?

716
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:18,426
- How about those Niners?
- Delivery.

717
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:23,425
- I'm gonna go see how she is.
- Me too.

718
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:40,421
Do you mind?

719
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:44,421
We just wanted to see
if you're okay.

720
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,420
I'm fine.
I just want to be alone.

721
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,419
Who do you think you are,
Greta Garbo?

722
00:48:50,419 --> 00:48:51,419
I mean it!

723
00:48:52,419 --> 00:48:55,418
It's no big deal, okay?
Now go!

724
00:48:56,418 --> 00:48:59,418
Frankie, there's other fish
in the sea.

725
00:48:59,418 --> 00:49:03,417
Alli, I don't want any other fish.
I want that fish.

726
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:06,416
The little blue-eyed,
angel-faced fish.

727
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:09,416
The David Shrader fish.

728
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,415
Fucking bastard!

729
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:16,414
What? What are you looking at?
This is all your fault.

730
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:19,414
First you leave me alone
like a dog for 17 years...

731
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:22,413
...and then you tease me
with this?

732
00:49:22,413 --> 00:49:26,412
You two have each other.
What do I have?

733
00:49:26,412 --> 00:49:28,412
Nothing. Nothing!

734
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:32,411
Hey, everything happens
for a reason.

735
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:35,411
Really, Einstein? Well,
explain the Holocaust to me then...


736
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,410
...because I've been trying
to figure that out for a while.

737
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,409
Frankie, come on,
he's just trying to help.

738
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:46,408
I know, and I appreciate it,
but would you guys just excuse me?

739
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:51,407
What a dickhead.

740
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:56,406
- Come on, he's not a dickhead.
- Not him. Me.

741
00:49:57,406 --> 00:50:00,406
Okay. You wanna go shopping?

742
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:06,404
Listen, I gotta get back downstairs.
I'll let you know when David leaves.

743
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:09,404
Rob, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

744
00:50:11,403 --> 00:50:14,403
Hey, we've all had
broken hearts before.

745
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:19,402
I'll never break your heart.
Promise.

746
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:29,400
- Alli, would you stay a little while?
- Sure.

747
00:50:31,399 --> 00:50:34,399
Oh, come here.
There you go.

748
00:50:38,398 --> 00:50:41,398
I saw no chemistry.
Did you see chemistry?

749
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:44,397
No. I saw no chemistry.
I saw... I saw physics.

750
00:50:44,397 --> 00:50:48,396
I saw a negative and I saw a positive.
I saw opposites attract, is what I saw.

751
00:50:48,396 --> 00:50:52,395
I saw incest. I mean,
they looked like brother and sister.

752
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:55,395
- Didn't they?
- Yes. They look like brother and sister.

753
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:58,394
And you know who got
the looks in that family.

754
00:50:58,394 --> 00:51:00,394
Honey, you're gonna find
somebody else.

755
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:03,393
Alli, I don't want to be
60 years old some day...

756
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:08,392
...seemingly happily married to some
man I know is my second choice...

757
00:51:08,392 --> 00:51:14,391
...and wondering whatever happened
to David Shrader, that beautiful angel...

758
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:17,390
...who came in and out of my life
and who never gave me a chance.

759
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,390
I don't want to have to settle for that.

760
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,389
Looks aren't everything,
but I don't get it.

761
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:27,388
I know. I mean, you know, she's not
ugly, but he could do better.

762
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:30,388
- Like, how much better?
- Like, way better.

763
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:34,387
- Like, "me" better?
- With the talk, "way better." Of course!

764
00:51:34,387 --> 00:51:36,387
- You know what else?
- What?

765
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:40,386
A name is directly related to
someone's sexual attractiveness.

766
00:51:40,386 --> 00:51:43,385
No, it's true.
It's a big medical breakthrough.

767
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:45,385
Scientists all over the world
discovered this.

768
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:48,384
I read it in the New England Journal.

769
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:51,384
- So, what are you saying?
- What I'm saying is...

770
00:51:51,384 --> 00:51:56,383
...with a name like Molly Munday,
a Little House on the Prairie name...

771
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:59,382
...you can bet that he's been dying
to shoot a good load.

772
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,382
- Frankie, with the talk! What's this...?
- What?

773
00:52:02,381 --> 00:52:06,381
Would you do it with someone whose
last name's the worst day of the week?

774
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:10,380
With the name "Molly"? That's not even
the cute blind one from Little House.

775
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,379
- That's Nellie Oleson.
- Nellie was the mean one.

776
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:17,378
- So?
- So I don't think she's mean.

777
00:52:17,378 --> 00:52:21,378
I think she's just, you know,
she's just ordinary.

778
00:52:21,378 --> 00:52:22,378
All right.

779
00:52:22,378 --> 00:52:24,377
Laura Ingalls.

780
00:52:24,377 --> 00:52:26,377
Definitely Laura.

781
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:30,376
You know, bella... 

782
00:52:31,376 --> 00:52:35,375
...not a day's gone by in 17 years
that we haven't been together.

783
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:40,374
And now I look at you,
such a beautiful young woman.

784
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:45,373
Just like your mama, Angelica.
She was beautiful too, you know.

785
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:50,372
I know. I'll never forget the day
se told me her name meant "angel."

786
00:52:50,372 --> 00:52:54,371
I thought she said she was an angel.

787
00:52:54,371 --> 00:53:00,370
- Until today l... I still believed it.
- Come on. Sit.

788
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,369
Please, sit down.

789
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:07,369
Uncle Leo sees something wrong
and I know what it is.

790
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:10,368
Sometimes things happen
are not so good.

791
00:53:10,368 --> 00:53:13,367
But you find good in them, capisci?

792
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:20,366
Maybe not today.
Maybe not next week.

793
00:53:20,366 --> 00:53:26,365
But one day things will all work out.
You trust me?

794
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:28,364
I know you.

795
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:31,364
Just remember what you got to have:
perseverance.

796
00:53:33,363 --> 00:53:35,363
Hi.

797
00:53:35,363 --> 00:53:37,363
Hi.

798
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:41,362
- What are you doing here?
- Don't we have plans tonight?

799
00:53:41,362 --> 00:53:43,361
Not until 10, if you still wanna go.

800
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:48,360
I'd like to talk to you, though.

801
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,360
Maybe we could take a walk
or something?

802
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,359
I really can't leave right now.

803
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:58,358
Hey, Francesca, what am l,
an invalid?

804
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:03,357
- Go on, get out of here.
- Okay. All right. I'll see you later.

805
00:54:11,356 --> 00:54:14,355
So, what do you want to talk about?

806
00:54:16,355 --> 00:54:18,355
Nothing, I guess.

807
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:22,354
Even nothing is something.

808
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:26,353
I think I wanted to say I'm sorry.

809
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:30,352
- There's nothing to be sorry about.
- I was gonna tell you.

810
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:35,351
I mean, it's not your fault. I assumed
you were single. I assumed wrong.

811
00:54:35,351 --> 00:54:37,351
You know what they say:
Never assume.

812
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:40,350
It'll only make an ass
out of you and me.

813
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:45,349
- Thank you, Felix Unger.
- I quote the truth wherever I find it.

814
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,349
What? She's at a loss for words?

815
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:51,348
Come on, cheer up.
It's not the end of the world.

816
00:54:51,348 --> 00:54:53,348
I know, I know. It's...

817
00:54:54,347 --> 00:54:56,347
It's just bad timing.

818
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:00,346
"Life can only be understood
backwards."

819
00:55:01,346 --> 00:55:03,346
Kierkegaard.

820
00:55:04,345 --> 00:55:07,345
Oh! "I wish I was like you,
easily amused."

821
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,344
Ouch. Kurt Cobain.

822
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:16,343
You know, before I even met you,
the day I was hired at the cafe...

823
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:19,342
...I saw your picture
and I couldn't stop staring at it.

824
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:23,342
It was... It was like I knew you
or something.

825
00:55:23,342 --> 00:55:25,341
I mean, the funny thing is, I was right.

826
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:29,340
You're exactly the way
I imagined you'd be.

827
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,340
And how's that?

828
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
Honest...

829
00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:38,339
...vibrant, different. I don't know.

830
00:55:39,338 --> 00:55:42,338
People who've know me for years
can't see in me...

831
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,337
...what you saw out of that picture.

832
00:55:44,337 --> 00:55:48,337
- Don't you think it means something?
- Frankie, I have a commitment.

833
00:55:48,337 --> 00:55:52,336
- I don't see a ring on this finger.
- You know what I mean.

834
00:55:54,336 --> 00:55:57,335
Do you love her?

835
00:55:58,335 --> 00:55:59,335
We've been together for so long.

836
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:03,334
You... You don't just throw away
three years on a chance.

837
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:06,333
- Are you gonna answer me?
- About what?

838
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,333
Love, David, love! Do you love her?

839
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:13,332
I mean, does the thought of her,
the smell of her, the touch of her...

840
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:17,331
...make you quiver? When she's away
from you, do you think about her...

841
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:20,330
...and wish she were in your arms
making love to you?

842
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:24,330
When you see her
after not seeing her for a whole day...

843
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,329
...does she make everything okay?

844
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:33,328
It's getting late. Leo's waiting.
We should go.

845
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:38,327
Okay, I get it. I get it. Just...

846
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:40,326
Just remember one thing:

847
00:56:41,326 --> 00:56:46,325
"Anything less than mad, passionate,
extraordinary love is a waste of time.

848
00:56:46,325 --> 00:56:49,325
There are too many mediocre things
in life to deal with...

849
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:52,324
...and love shouldn't be one of them."

850
00:56:55,323 --> 00:56:57,323
You live in a dream world.

851
00:56:57,323 --> 00:57:00,322
Don't I wish.

852
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:12,320
Roberto. You don't look so sad.
Your Allison, she leave you tomorrow.

853
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,319
Oh, I mean, I'm...
You know, I'm gonna miss her.

854
00:57:15,319 --> 00:57:18,319
I mean, she's my girlfriend, right?
But you know...

855
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,318
...when you've been single
as long as I have...

856
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:24,318
- Bello, come here. Sit down.
- Sit down?

857
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,317
Sit down, bello.
I want to ask you something.

858
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:32,316
You love this girl?

859
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:37,315
- Well...
- What, I pressure you too much?

860
00:57:37,315 --> 00:57:39,315
Let me tell you something!

861
00:57:39,315 --> 00:57:43,314
- If you love this girl and let her go...
- Papa, I...

862
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:46,313
I think that this separation
might do us some good.

863
00:57:47,313 --> 00:57:51,312
You know, strengthen
our bond a little. Yes.

864
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:03,310
What? He has writer's block.
I'm helping unplug him.

865
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:06,309
That's great, but my shift was over
hours ago...

866
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:10,309
No, no, no, no, no!
Tonight's a very important night.

867
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:13,308
- Please, cover for me!
- Don't worry. He'll be deleted.

868
00:58:13,308 --> 00:58:16,307
- "Delighted."
- Thank you. Thank you. I adore you.

869
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:20,307
Did I ever tell you
you're my favorite cousin?

870
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:22,306
I'm your only cousin.

871
00:58:22,306 --> 00:58:25,306
You know what John Lennon said.
"One is all you need."

872
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:28,305
No, he said "love."
"Love is all you need."

873
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,305
He was right.

874
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:50,301
- Smile. God loves you.
- Yeah, right. At least you're leaving.

875
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,300
- What's not eating you?
- Nothing.

876
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,299
The last thing I want to discuss
right now is my lack of character.

877
00:58:59,299 --> 00:59:03,298
Come on. You only have me
for one more day. Talk.

878
00:59:05,298 --> 00:59:08,297
It's something I have to work out
for myself, you know?

879
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:12,296
Did something happen
between you and B.J.?

880
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:17,295
No. It's... It's me. It's me.

881
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:22,294
Can I tell you something?
You don't steal. You don't murder.

882
00:59:22,294 --> 00:59:26,294
You don't deal drugs and
your father loves you very much.

883
00:59:26,294 --> 00:59:31,293
I promise you, as soon as you
realize this, your life will change.

884
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:36,292
Hi.

885
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:44,290
What is it with you hoser family, eh?
Manic depression?

886
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:48,289
Really, we cheer up occasionally,
but we get over it.

887
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:54,288
Love. What's it all about? Bout.
Bout.

888
00:59:54,288 --> 00:59:58,287
Alli, you're never going
to have to play a Canadian.

889
00:59:58,287 --> 01:00:03,286
Vancouver and Toronto happen to be
the biggest film communities going.

890
01:00:03,286 --> 01:00:06,286
So are we still waiting
for Mr. Shrader?

891
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:09,285
- Haven't quite given up?
- I never give up.

892
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:12,284
I either get what I want,
or I change my mind.

893
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:14,284
See, I know you.

894
01:00:15,284 --> 01:00:19,283
I have until sunrise to make him
fall in love with me.

895
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:24,282
- How do I look?
- Natural beauty. It works for you.

896
01:00:24,282 --> 01:00:26,282
Thanks, I think.

897
01:00:26,282 --> 01:00:30,281
Stealing a man from a live-in, that
ain't easy. Unless he's married.

898
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:32,280
Knock on wood.

899
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,279
God, I think that's Leo. Let me...
Allison, can l...? We'll do one of these.

900
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:40,279
- All right.
- This is getting so tired, Roberto.

901
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:43,278
- Does somebody need a nap?
- Yeah. You, Groucho.

902
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:46,278
- What the hell did I do?
- Nothing. Nothing.

903
01:00:46,278 --> 01:00:49,277
I'm just sick of people hiding the truth.
You're gay. Big fucking deal!

904
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:52,276
- Stop being such a pussy!
- Why do you say that word?

905
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:56,276
- You know that I hate that word.
- Not nearly as much as I do.

906
01:00:57,276 --> 01:00:59,275
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.
We're all pussies.

907
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:02,275
It's what we have to overcome
in our life, our pussiness.

908
01:01:03,274 --> 01:01:06,274
It's gonna be so nice and quiet
around here when you're gone.

909
01:01:06,274 --> 01:01:09,273
Can't you just say "vagina,"
if you have to say anything?

910
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:11,273
Please, just not the P word.

911
01:01:11,273 --> 01:01:13,272
Who will you hide behind
when we're gone?

912
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:16,272
Fuck you, Frankie!
You got no idea what this is like.

913
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:22,271
My grandmother used to call it
a "fee-fee." Isn't that nice? A "fee-fee"?

914
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:28,269
- See? There. Make love, not war.
- You crazy people.

915
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:32,269
- B.J. calls it a "ravioli."
- Hey, B.J. has a ravioli?

916
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:34,268
- Oh, God, no.
- Wouldn't have known.

917
01:01:34,268 --> 01:01:36,268
Where are you going?

918
01:01:37,268 --> 01:01:41,267
- I've got some nuts to crack.
- Sorry. It's been a long day, cugino.

919
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:45,266
I know. What am I doing?
I'm gonna miss the hell out of you.

920
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:48,265
I didn't mean what I said.
It's none of my business.

921
01:01:48,265 --> 01:01:51,265
Of course it isn't, but you know what?
I think you're right.

922
01:01:51,265 --> 01:01:56,264
- So I will see you pussies later.
- You know what? Get out.

923
01:01:57,264 --> 01:02:00,263
- I'm not related to him.
- Oh, but you are.

924
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:04,262
So, honey, you haven't
told me your plan to woo Mr. Shrader.

925
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,262
- Care to share?
- I don't think you're ready for it.

926
01:02:07,262 --> 01:02:09,261
I am never ready. Go.

927
01:02:10,261 --> 01:02:14,260
I'm going to circumnavigate his soul
until he's anchored on all sides...

928
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,260
...by my love.

929
01:02:18,259 --> 01:02:20,259
- There's a good omen.
- Hi.

930
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:23,258
- Hi.
- Hi.

931
01:02:27,258 --> 01:02:29,257
Okay, bye.

932
01:02:29,257 --> 01:02:32,257
Okay, honey. I'll be back
in the morning and we will load up.

933
01:02:33,256 --> 01:02:36,256
- And then we are out of here.
- Otay, Panky.

934
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:39,255
Otay. We're really gonna do this,
aren't we?

935
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,255
We're gonna do it.

936
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:58,252
- Okay, bye.
- Bye, Allison.

937
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:07,250
- The night is young. Shall we?
- Yes.

938
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,249
- We're not gonna rob banks, are we?
- No.

939
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:12,249
I don't think so.

940
01:04:21,235 --> 01:04:24,235
Here, so you don't forget
where you came from.

941
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:38,232
Are you inspired yet?

942
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:03,227
- Now what?
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

943
01:05:04,227 --> 01:05:07,226
- Here. Open this.
- Excuse me?

944
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:11,225
Look at the bright side.
This is better than warm milk.

945
01:05:11,225 --> 01:05:14,225
- Let's live a little.
- I...

946
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:20,223
What? You said you wanted
to leave your mark. Look, "Juice."

947
01:05:20,223 --> 01:05:22,223
You're not gonna spray paint
this wall, are you?

948
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,222
"Spray paint"?
No, we're gonna decorate the wall.

949
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,222
This is an industrial art form.

950
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,221
- Do you do this often?
- I've never done it before.

951
01:05:31,221 --> 01:05:34,221
But Juice does it all the time.
How hard can it be?

952
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,220
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know, do anything. Be creative.

953
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,219
Most graffiti artists have a tag.

954
01:05:42,219 --> 01:05:44,219
Watch.

955
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:01,215
All right, your turn.

956
01:06:04,215 --> 01:06:06,214
All right.

957
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:27,210
That's beautiful, but this isn't
the Sistine Chapel.

958
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:30,210
You might want to speed it up
a little bit.

959
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:34,209
I'm only gonna do this once in my life.
I want to do it right.

960
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:36,208
I think I'm gonna add a little color...

961
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:44,207
Wow. I've never been in jail before.
Have you?

962
01:06:45,207 --> 01:06:48,206
No, Frankie, as a matter of fact,
I haven't.

963
01:06:48,206 --> 01:06:52,205
- Is Molly gonna be upset?
- Frankie, we gotta talk.

964
01:06:52,205 --> 01:06:55,205
- Good. Me first.
- No, no, no. This is serious.

965
01:06:56,204 --> 01:06:58,204
So is this.

966
01:07:00,204 --> 01:07:02,203
I'm moving to L.A.,
and I want you to come with me.

967
01:07:03,203 --> 01:07:05,203
- What?
- I'm in love with you.

968
01:07:05,203 --> 01:07:11,201
What? Frankie, things aren't the same
in real life as they are in your dreams.

969
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:14,201
- They could be if you let them.
- I don't agree. It's not that simple.

970
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:18,200
Then you've never been in love before.

971
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:29,198
- You don't know what you're missing.
- Maybe later.

972
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:35,197
- Go ahead. Call me stupid.
- Stupid?

973
01:07:36,196 --> 01:07:38,196
I would never call you stupid, David.

974
01:07:38,196 --> 01:07:41,195
A stupid man wouldn't succeed
in fooling himself as you do.

975
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:45,195
Molly's a good person, really.

976
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:50,194
She's smart, she's kind,
she knows all my bad habits.

977
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:54,193
- I'm happy with her.
- You're safe with her.

978
01:07:55,193 --> 01:07:57,192
I love her. I do.

979
01:07:58,192 --> 01:08:04,191
Well, I love a good cappuccino, but I
wouldn't drink it if I didn't get it for free.

980
01:08:04,191 --> 01:08:06,191
What is that supposed to mean?

981
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:10,190
I don't know.
Something to do with passion.

982
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:14,189
You seem to think I have a lot
of choices here. I don't see it that way.

983
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:18,188
Choices are like connecting highways.

984
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:22,187
They all take you to the same place.
Some just take longer to get there.

985
01:08:22,187 --> 01:08:25,187
Frank Poncherello. I don't know.
Who said that?

986
01:08:25,187 --> 01:08:27,186
I just made it up.

987
01:08:28,186 --> 01:08:31,186
- It was good.
- See?

988
01:08:31,186 --> 01:08:35,185
We can be best friends but we'd still
have lust in our eyes.

989
01:08:36,185 --> 01:08:39,184
You need to learn the difference
between dreams and reality.

990
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:41,184
It's night and day.

991
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:43,183
I know more than you give me
credit for.

992
01:08:43,183 --> 01:08:46,183
What is it that you know
that I don't know?

993
01:08:47,182 --> 01:08:52,181
I know life can be taken away from you
at any random moment, David.

994
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:56,181
I know if you don't make an effort
to be happy, you won't be happy.

995
01:08:56,181 --> 01:09:02,179
And I know there's a point when your
"maybe later" becomes too late.

996
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:07,178
If you only dream when you're asleep,
when you wake up, nothing's there.

997
01:09:12,177 --> 01:09:14,177
I'm really gonna miss you.

998
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:22,175
I guess that means
you're not coming with me.

999
01:09:27,174 --> 01:09:30,174
- You tired?
- No.

1000
01:09:30,174 --> 01:09:33,173
Should probably try and get some rest.

1001
01:09:43,171 --> 01:09:45,171
Okay, you two. You're out of here.

1002
01:10:00,168 --> 01:10:03,167
Here, you keep this.

1003
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:08,166
So you remember
where I left my heart.

1004
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:41,148
- Bye.
- Bye.

1005
01:11:41,148 --> 01:11:43,148
Bye, Uncle Leo.

1006
01:12:07,143 --> 01:12:09,142
Roberto.

1007
01:12:10,142 --> 01:12:14,141
You're a good boy. We're gonna
be fine, you and me. Don't worry.

1008
01:12:14,141 --> 01:12:19,140
- I have to talk to you. This is important.
- You hear what I said?

1009
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,140
Well, you might hold off on this
pride stuff until you hear what I say.

1010
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:27,139
What? What it is?

1011
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:30,138
Promise to hear me out before
you make any judgments.

1012
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:32,138
- All right?
- No, no, Roberto.

1013
01:12:32,138 --> 01:12:36,137
You know me. I don't make
no promises. I don't know why.

1014
01:12:36,137 --> 01:12:39,136
Tell me why, and maybe I make
the promise.

1015
01:12:41,136 --> 01:12:43,136
All right.

1016
01:12:45,135 --> 01:12:49,134
- You see, this isn't easy for me.
- Roberto, I teach you to be a man.

1017
01:12:49,134 --> 01:12:55,133
- Tell me. Talk to me. Be a man.
- Papa, l... I'm a...

1018
01:12:59,133 --> 01:13:03,132
Roberto, I got a tee time soon,
you know? Talk. What?

1019
01:13:04,132 --> 01:13:06,131
All right.

1020
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:09,131
Papa, I am...

1021
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:15,129
Come on, Frankie. You know what?
I cannot take five hours of this. I can't.

1022
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:20,128
- I put the top down. It's freezing!
- I need the air.

1023
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:23,128
Oh, great. Five hours,
me and Norma Desmond.

1024
01:13:24,128 --> 01:13:26,127
Great. Just great, great, great, great.

1025
01:13:26,127 --> 01:13:29,127
I so worried I think
you're gonna tell me:

1026
01:13:29,127 --> 01:13:33,126
"Papa, I murdered someone."

1027
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:36,125
But no, instead you
tell me something...

1028
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,125
...l've already known
for a long, long time now.

1029
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:44,124
- What? You knew?
- Come on. Francesca, you know.

1030
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:48,123
I love her. She's a woman.
She's wonderful. She says:

1031
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:53,122
She told you? What about that stuff,
the girlfriends and the wives? What?

1032
01:13:54,122 --> 01:14:00,120
I figure I'll wait until you're ready.
So I wait. I wait, I wait and I wait.

1033
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,120
Finally, I think maybe I give him
a push and he spill the peas.

1034
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,119
I'm right.

1035
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:09,119
You're not ashamed of me
or anything?

1036
01:14:12,118 --> 01:14:17,117
Roberto, I love you. You're my son.

1037
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:20,116
We're the same blood.

1038
01:14:24,116 --> 01:14:28,115
I love you so much,
I just want you to be happy.

1039
01:14:28,115 --> 01:14:31,114
Whatever makes you happy,
me happy.

1040
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:34,114
I just don't want to know the details,
capisci?

1041
01:14:56,109 --> 01:14:58,109
Hello, gorgeous.

1042
01:14:59,109 --> 01:15:01,108
Looks like we're running out of room?
Here you go.

1043
01:15:02,108 --> 01:15:04,108
- We got another one.
- Hello?

1044
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:07,107
Couldn't you pretend you're excited
to see me?

1045
01:15:07,107 --> 01:15:09,107
I've got the self-esteem of a cover girl.

1046
01:15:09,107 --> 01:15:12,106
- Coffee, two sugars.
- Sure.

1047
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:15,106
Can I have a cup? Wow.

1048
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:23,104
- You gotta love him, though, David.
- Yeah.

1049
01:15:30,103 --> 01:15:33,102
- Hi.
- Hi. What's up?

1050
01:15:33,102 --> 01:15:36,101
You forgot your keys.
I didn't want you to be locked out.

1051
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:38,101
Thank you.

1052
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,100
I'm off in 10 minutes.
Wanna stick around?

1053
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,100
We'll go out for sushi or something?

1054
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:48,099
Sushi? Since when did you eat sushi?

1055
01:15:50,099 --> 01:15:53,098
Since I decided to go
out on a limb for my art.

1056
01:15:54,098 --> 01:15:56,097
I don't eat anything with a heartbeat.

1057
01:15:56,097 --> 01:15:58,097
- That's right.
- Besides, I can't. I don't have time.

1058
01:15:59,097 --> 01:16:02,096
- I got too much work to do.
- Well, what about later?

1059
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:04,096
You'll need a break.
We could catch a late movie.

1060
01:16:05,096 --> 01:16:08,095
David, please.

1061
01:16:09,095 --> 01:16:11,094
We can't live off our love alone.

1062
01:16:13,094 --> 01:16:14,094
- I have to go.
- All right.

1063
01:16:15,094 --> 01:16:17,093
- Bye.
- Bye.

1064
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:30,091
Molly!

1065
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:33,090
Molly.

1066
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:35,090
David.

1067
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,089
What's the matter?

1068
01:16:45,088 --> 01:16:49,087
"Anything less than mad, passionate,
extraordinary love...

1069
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:53,086
...is a waste of your time."
- What?

1070
01:16:54,086 --> 01:16:56,086
- She's pregnant. I swear.
- I can see what she's saying.

1071
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:59,085
- No!
- She can't be pregnant, please.

1072
01:16:59,085 --> 01:17:02,084
- No, honey, please.
- She's not happy.

1073
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:05,084
- Oh, no!
- Freak-out. Look at her!

1074
01:17:05,084 --> 01:17:06,084
Throw it back.

1075
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:09,083
- Honey, she's going at it.
- That's cold.

1076
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,083
No, this isn't funny.

1077
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:15,082
- No, no, no.
- Oh, she's off.

1078
01:17:15,082 --> 01:17:17,081
- She's bolting.
- She's whaling on him.

1079
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:19,081
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

1080
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:31,079
Sorry about the short notice.
Don't worry about my paycheck.

1081
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:35,078
- What? What the hell are you doing?
- I quit.

1082
01:17:36,078 --> 01:17:37,077
You...

1083
01:17:38,077 --> 01:17:41,077
Is it me, or are they
dropping like flies?

1084
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:44,076
Don't even think about it.
That's your man.

1085
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:54,074
Hello. Hi. How are you?

1086
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:57,073
And you said my accents
would never come in handy.

1087
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,073
- Well, I did it.
- Did what?

1088
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:03,072
The commercial! I got the commercial.
I shoot tomorrow.

1089
01:18:03,072 --> 01:18:06,072
It's two months' rent in one day.

1090
01:18:08,071 --> 01:18:09,071
I didn't get it?

1091
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:12,071
You cannot demand proof
that the product works...

1092
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:16,070
...and expect to get hired.
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1093
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,069
I have a tortured soul.

1094
01:18:22,069 --> 01:18:27,068
Okay, I have a feeling this has nothing
to do with the commercial, young lady.

1095
01:18:27,068 --> 01:18:32,067
Not one word. You think he'd at least
call or write or something.

1096
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:36,066
I mean, for all he knows,
I could be in a gutter somewhere.

1097
01:18:37,066 --> 01:18:40,065
He doesn't care.

1098
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:43,064
Frankie, he's got a girlfriend.

1099
01:18:43,064 --> 01:18:46,064
You wouldn't want him calling
a girl if he was going out with you.

1100
01:18:46,064 --> 01:18:50,063
Come on, you understand that.
You've really got to get over him.

1101
01:18:51,063 --> 01:18:53,062
You've got to move on.

1102
01:18:55,062 --> 01:18:58,061
- Think I should call him?
- Yeah, let's call him at work.

1103
01:19:00,061 --> 01:19:03,060
- No, wait! I'm scared.
- Too late.

1104
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,060
I'll just be honest.
I'll tell him how much I miss him...

1105
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:10,059
...and that I can't live...
- David! Hi.

1106
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:12,059
Frankie wants to talk to you.

1107
01:19:13,058 --> 01:19:14,058
Hi.

1108
01:19:15,058 --> 01:19:18,057
Uncle Leo.

1109
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:21,057
Fine. Yeah.

1110
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:24,056
No, Alli got it.

1111
01:19:25,056 --> 01:19:27,056
How are you?

1112
01:19:27,056 --> 01:19:29,055
You miss me?

1113
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:31,055
Does anyone else miss me?

1114
01:19:32,055 --> 01:19:34,054
Does David miss me?

1115
01:19:35,054 --> 01:19:40,053
Is he there?
Because I need to talk to him.

1116
01:19:41,053 --> 01:19:44,052
Well, when will he be back?

1117
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:48,051
He what?

1118
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,051
Did he leave a number?

1119
01:19:52,051 --> 01:19:54,050
Anything?

1120
01:19:57,050 --> 01:20:00,049
No, I'm okay. I'm...

1121
01:20:00,049 --> 01:20:03,049
I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

1122
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:07,048
- What, what, what?
- He quit about an hour ago.

1123
01:20:07,048 --> 01:20:10,047
Apparently, he just ran off.
No word, no nothing.

1124
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:13,047
Alli, he's gone.
I don't have his number.

1125
01:20:13,047 --> 01:20:16,046
I don't even know where he lives.

1126
01:20:20,045 --> 01:20:21,045
I'm doomed.

1127
01:20:23,045 --> 01:20:26,044
No, I'm doomed.
I'm doomed.

1128
01:20:28,044 --> 01:20:30,043
Hello, I am Deepa.

1129
01:20:30,043 --> 01:20:32,043
With Sheik condom,
you can go...

1130
01:20:33,043 --> 01:20:35,042
- Sorry. Am I in your way?
- Yes.

1131
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:38,042
- More.
- Okay. With Sheik...

1132
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:41,041
The belly. Show the belly.
Right. Good.

1133
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:42,041
Oh, God.

1134
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:45,040
- Dolly. Watch the dolly.
- Ready? Okay.

1135
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,040
Hello, I am Deepa.

1136
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,039
And with Sheik condom,
they are thinner...

1137
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:53,039
...they are...

1138
01:20:54,038 --> 01:20:56,038
I'm sorry. What's the line?
I forgot the line.

1139
01:20:56,038 --> 01:20:58,038
- Stronger.
- Okay, thank you. Sorry.

1140
01:20:58,038 --> 01:21:03,037
I knew this one. Okay.
Hello, I am Deepa.

1141
01:21:03,037 --> 01:21:07,036
And with Sheik condom,
they are stronger, they are thinner...

1142
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:12,035
...and you can go deeper
with Sheik.

1143
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:14,034
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1144
01:21:14,034 --> 01:21:17,034
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
I just did that.

1145
01:21:17,034 --> 01:21:19,033
Oh, dear. Okay.

1146
01:21:19,033 --> 01:21:22,033
So cut, I guess?

1147
01:21:22,033 --> 01:21:24,032
Is this Michigan information?

1148
01:21:25,032 --> 01:21:28,032
Do you have a number
for a Shrader residence?

1149
01:21:28,032 --> 01:21:32,031
S-H-R-A-D-E-R.

1150
01:21:32,031 --> 01:21:35,030
I don't know the first name.

1151
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:38,030
I don't have an address.

1152
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:40,029
How many do you have?

1153
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,029
Can I have all of them, please?

1154
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:46,028
Is this the Shrader residence?

1155
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:49,028
Do you know a David Shrader?

1156
01:21:50,027 --> 01:21:52,027
Are you related to a David Shrader?

1157
01:21:53,027 --> 01:21:56,026
Have you ever met a David Shrader?

1158
01:21:56,026 --> 01:21:59,026
Have you ever heard
of a David Shrader?

1159
01:21:59,026 --> 01:22:04,025
No? No Shrader?
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

1160
01:22:06,024 --> 01:22:07,024
Who is it?

1161
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,023
All right. I'm coming.

1162
01:22:16,022 --> 01:22:18,022
David!

1163
01:22:33,019 --> 01:22:35,018
This is your room, right?

1164
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:40,017
What about Molly?

01:22:40,017 --> 01:22:42,017
"There are too many mediocre
things in life to deal with...

1166
01:22:42,017 --> 01:22:44,017
...and love shouldn't be
one of them."

1167
01:22:45,016 --> 01:22:48,016
Have I ever told you
how beautiful you are?

1168
01:22:48,016 --> 01:22:51,015
No. Go ahead.

1169
01:22:51,015 --> 01:22:55,014
You are so beautiful,
I can't even describe how beautiful.

1170
01:22:55,014 --> 01:22:57,014
That makes you beautiful squared.

1171
01:22:58,014 --> 01:22:59,014
That makes you beautiful infinity.

1172
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:02,013
That makes you beautiful
infinity times infinity.

1173
01:23:03,013 --> 01:23:06,012
You always have to
one-up me, don't you?

1174
01:23:06,012 --> 01:23:08,012
I have an idea.

1175
01:23:08,012 --> 01:23:10,011
Let's take turns
one-upping each other.

1176
01:23:11,011 --> 01:23:13,011
- I love you, Frankie.
- You do?

1177
01:23:13,011 --> 01:23:15,010
Yeah, I do.

1178
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:18,010
- I loved you first.
- Well, I love you more.

1179
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:21,009
Only because you're bigger.

1180
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:010,000
Sweet dreams.

1181
01:24:010,000 --> 01:24:030,000
