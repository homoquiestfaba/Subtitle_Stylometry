1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,460
<i>Before war...</i>

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,530
<i>New York...</i>

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,690
<i>Before I was born.</i>

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,960
<i>The place I've only seen pictures of.</i>

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>I know you...</i>

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,990
<i>but we've never meet.</i>

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,720
<i>I'm with you...</i>

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,550
<i>but I don't know your name.</i>

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,690
<i>I know I'm dreaming...</i>

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,520
<i>but it feels like more than that.</i>

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,060
<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,170
<i>How can that be?</i>

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,200
<i>March 14, 2077.</i>

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,800
<i>Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,600
<i>And I'm still haunted by these dreams.</i>

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,560
<i>Victoria and I were assigned together.</i>

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,180
<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be
finished, and we'll join the others.</i>

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>But the questions I ask,
she doesn't.</i>

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,520
<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,850
<i>It's been half a century
since the scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,200
<i>Forced to leave their own dying planet,</i>

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,600
<i>they came to take ours.</i>

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>Without the moon,
the Earth was thrown into chaos.</i>

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,100
<i>Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.</i>

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,960
<i>Tsunamis wiped out what we make.</i>

26
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,610
<i>Then came the invasion.</i>

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,250
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

28
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,240
<i>We used the nukes.</i>

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,690
<i>We won the war, but lost the planet.</i>

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,750
<i>Left it contaminated.</i>

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,160
<i>Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,300
<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the earth.</i>

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,390
<i>We built the Tet, our mission control.</i>

34
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,880
<i>The Temporary Space Station
before the migration to Titan.</i>

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,970
<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,330
<i>Everyone's there now.</i>

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,900
<i>Well... almost every one.</i>

38
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,900
Thank you for the coffee.

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,290
<i>Remainants of the scavengers army
continue to disrupt the operation.</i>

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,480
<i>They attack our drones at night.</i>

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,110
<i>They try to kill me during the day.</i>

42
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,990
<i>They're still fighting them, but I don't know why.</i>

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,500
<i>Mission says we have done well.</i>

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,110
<i>And we are an effective team.</i>

45
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,340
<i>Vica's my communication officer.</i>

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,340
<i>She keeps an eye on me.</i>

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,730
<i>And I handle drone maintenance.</i>

48
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,630
<i>The drones watch everything.</i>

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,000
<i>Vica can't wait to go.</i>

50
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,130
<i>Me? I'm not so sure.</i>

51
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,370
<i>I can't shake the feeling that Earth,</i>

52
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,510
<i>in spite of all that's happened,
Earth is still my home.</i>

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,130
Jack Harper, Tech 49

54
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,750
Morning, Bob!

55
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,930
<i>Tower, call check!</i>

56
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>Drone maintenance technician 49,
Hydro Rig support.</i>

57
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,080
All Bobby ship system are green.

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,260
I'm good to go.

59
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,830
Copy Tech-49, you're clear,
be careful out there.

60
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,940
- Always am.
- No, you're not.

61
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,520
You're right.

62
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,580
I gotta work on that.

63
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,500
Alright, Tet's coming online in 30 seconds.

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,370
Relay Hydro Rig coordinates now.
Contact visual.

65
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,900
I got them.
Hydro Rigs are sucking sea water.

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,830
You got them, Bob?

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,680
Drone 185 looks good.

68
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,600
Jack, we've got two drones down.

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,110
Shit!

70
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,430
Stand by! Mission coming online.

71
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,880
<i>Okay, Tet contact.</i>

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,730
Morning, boss.

73
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,460
Tower 49, this is mission control.

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,620
How are you feeling this lovely morning?

75
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,480
Another day in paradise, Sally.

76
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,070
Uploading data now.

77
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,570
49 mission log, day 1642,
Hydro Rig support.

78
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,600
- I have two...
- Two drones offline,

79
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,640
perimeter's compromised.

80
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,950
Copy that. Relaying to Tet, stand by.

81
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,880
Jack. 166 is down in grid 37.

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,790
Linking to beacon now.

83
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,400
You go there first.

84
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,500
Got it. On my way.

85
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,430
Tech 49 is on route to grid 37 now.

86
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,400
Can you plug that hole with drone 109?

87
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,640
Negative. 109 is in the dock.

88
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,410
Still waiting for parts.

89
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,840
Jack's better find those drones and get them flying.

90
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,950
Those rigs can't be exposed overnight.

91
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,130
Copy that.

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,080
Tower, did he fixed 166 recently?

93
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,030
Jack has fixed all the drones recently.

94
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,893
And if we had the parts
that we'd been asking for,

95
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:42,550
we wouldn't be running
a skeleton grid down here.

96
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,130
Understood. We're doing the best we can.

97
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,550
- Are you an effective team?
- We are an effective team.

98
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,290
Your directive today is to
rehabilitate 166 and find 172.

99
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,414
Get them flying by Sunday,

100
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:02,310
and I'll buy you two rounds of
drinks when you get up to the Tet.

101
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,690
You'd better be ready, Sally.
Two weeks now.

102
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,910
Well I'm keeping track.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,190
Well, glad to be here, buddy.

104
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,010
Tech-49.

105
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,010
Tech-49.

106
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,990
Jack?

107
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Copy Tower.

108
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,800
What happened? I lost you for a second.

109
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,930
Really?

110
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,040
Coming up on location.

111
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,200
There it is.

112
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,590
We have multiple scav kills.

113
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,390
Drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.

114
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,470
Got any movement?

115
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
No sign of scavenger activity.

116
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,950
I've got a limited visibility here, Jack.
You should handle this mission.

117
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,950
<i>Copy that.</i>

118
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,320
I am coming in now.

119
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,040
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.

120
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,930
Always do.

121
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,990
You know, I've read about this game.

122
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,010
It was played right here.

123
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,340
The last Super Bowl.

124
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,680
- Please don't tell me it was a classic.
- Classic game.

125
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,840
Ahead by 4.

126
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,370
<i>The ball...</i>

127
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,070
It was on the 50 yard line.

128
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,990
Seconds left on the clock.

129
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,260
Ball was snapped.

130
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,480
QB fumbles.

131
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,280
Disaster.

132
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,180
Looks like the game is over.

133
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,145
I'm reading the whole
central core off alignment,

134
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:44,740
you don't have the necessary
tools down there.

135
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,580
<i>A new fuel cell's not gonna fix that.</i>

136
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,130
- But this QB runs back-
- Jack.

137
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,390
- <i>picks up his own fumble.</i>
- Hold on, what did you just do?

138
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,130
<i>A wall of linebackers closing in on him.</i>

139
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,630
<i>So he throws a long ball,</i>

140
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,850
<i>with no idea who is at the other end.</i>

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
Hail Mary.

142
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,700
80,000 people on their feet,
watching this ball sail through the air!

143
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,170
And down field...

144
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,980
would be wild receiver, first strike,

145
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,090
just leaps out of the back...

146
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,590
Touch Down!

147
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,430
Contact! West contact!

148
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,430
Jack?

149
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,670
It's okay, Vica.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,120
It's just a dog.

151
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,190
Now go away!
Get out of here!

152
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,020
Go on! Get out of here!
Go!

153
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,030
Tech 49 Jack Harper.

154
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,870
You're welcome.

155
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,280
166 back online.

156
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,700
<i>Two drones shot down today.</i>

157
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,300
10 fuel cell stolen in just over a month,

158
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,460
these scavs are getting bolder.

159
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,190
<i>Well, Hydro Rigs are taking all the bullshit.</i>

160
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,670
Once we're gone, they'll have
nothing but dust and radiation.

161
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,600
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

162
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,040
We won the war.
And we have to leave.

163
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,680
Two more weeks, Jack.

164
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,050
And we'll be on our way to Titan.

165
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,380
Yeah.

166
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,140
That drone is out there somewhere.

167
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,850
We just have to find him.

168
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,120
Without a beacon, it's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

169
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,160
For it we go our ground game.

170
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,450
Tower.

171
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,460
Located 172...

172
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,800
in a sinkhole.

173
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,160
No visual but I can hear it.

174
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,920
Tet so far off angle, I can barely see you.
How does it look?

175
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,810
It's good! It's good! There's no sign
of scav activity on top.

176
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,595
<i>Tet's offline in 15 minutes.</i>

177
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,020
<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

178
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,470
<i>Mission, this is Tower 49.</i>

179
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,010
<i>Jack has located drone 172.</i>

180
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>Engage recovery now.</i>

181
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,860
Requesting backup to his location ASAP.

182
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,110
I've got a visual on drone 172.

183
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,110
Jack?

184
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,990
What the hell?

185
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,990
Shit!

186
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:53,807
Jack!

187
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,380
Tech 49 Jack Harper.

188
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,960
Jack Harper Tech 49.

189
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,390
Oh, come on!

190
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,830
Not my goddamn bike!

191
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,820
"And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,

192
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,570
For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his Gods?"

193
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,570
Jack.

194
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,300
Yeah!
I'll be right there.

195
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,700
<i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>

196
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,840
How does 109 look?

197
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,770
- Can it fly?
- Barely.

198
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,450
But without armor she's a sitting duck.

199
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,070
Well I'll talk to Sally about that
shielding in the morning.

200
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,760
Again.

201
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,480
What, Jack Harper?

202
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,680
Where did you get this?

203
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,850
It was growing, and...

204
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,060
Come on Jack, you know the regulations,

205
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,114
we don't need a mistake, we have
no idea what kind of toxins

206
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:55,010
could be on something like that.

207
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,960
- It's a flower, Vica....
- Yeah, that's not the point.

208
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,203
It's that we are so close to the end,

209
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:04,690
and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk.

210
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
Okay.

211
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,660
Every day you have to go down there.

212
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,910
And see what was lost.

213
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,720
But we've done our job, Jack.

214
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,370
It's time to go.

215
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,410
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.

216
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,280
The Scavs.

217
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,310
They were trying to catch me.

218
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,530
I can't have you.

219
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,750
Come on.

220
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,480
You should come with me some time.
Before we leave.

221
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,810
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.

222
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,160
I'll show you something.

223
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,150
Oh, my God...

224
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,570
It was a six stage melt-down
from inside the Hydro Rigs core.

225
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,540
It's offline permanently.

226
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,280
Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.

227
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,480
I need to know exactly what happened.

228
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,763
Jack claims the scavs weaponised
one of the stolen fuel cells

229
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:50,090
and got it into the suction.

230
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,500
Tower, hold!

231
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,500
Tower?

232
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,180
I've got a rogue signal in grid 370.
You seeing this?

233
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
Yes!

234
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,500
It's gotta be scav.

235
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,670
It's not one of ours.

236
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,670
Jack.

237
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,220
The signal's being directed off planet.

238
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,570
On my way.

239
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,090
Tower, our logs show, you are missing
an additional 9 fuel cells. Can you confirm?

240
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,740
Negative mission, that number is 10.

241
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,350
Drone 172 was lost last night.

242
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,150
109 is combat ready since you get that shield ring.

243
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,550
We can cover the remaining rigs with drones
in the field. I've run the numbers.

244
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,330
We're using the numbers in the field, Tower.

245
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,590
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.

246
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,490
Copy.

247
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,700
Our job is to run those rigs,
your directive is to maintain them.

248
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,120
We cannot afford to lose another.

249
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,700
Do you copy?

250
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Copy.

251
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
Are you and Jack an effective team?

252
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,380
Damn right, we are!

253
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
Jack?

254
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,920
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?

255
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Jack?

256
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,390
Yeah, I got it.

257
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,690
It's some kind of repeater.

258
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,850
The scavs are using a
building as an antenna.

259
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,320
Can you decrypt?

260
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,030
It's a sort of coordinates.

261
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,170
Grid 17.

262
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,980
It's a goddamn holy beacon.

263
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,740
Grid 17.

264
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,030
What the hell is out there?

265
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,400
Nothing!
It's in the middle of nowhere!

266
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,410
What is going on?

267
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,370
Why would the scavs
send a signal off planet, Jack?

268
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm shutting it down.

269
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,210
Tech-49, check your course.
You're headed right for the border.

270
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,460
That radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it.

271
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,990
It's okay Vica, I see it.

272
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,350
I'm gonna do a perimeter check...

273
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,340
before I head home.

274
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,960
I may go off comm.

275
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,800
Jack, we should keep in contact.
Just let me know where you are.

276
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,620
Do you copy?

277
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,470
Jack, do you copy?

278
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,180
That's right, Bob.

279
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,180
You know where we're going!

280
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,000
You're gonna miss me?

281
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,580
I'm gonna miss this place.

282
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,410
It would've been great.

283
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,100
Vica! Vica, did you get that?

284
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,640
Jack, where have you been?

285
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,000
An object came down in 17.

286
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,540
That's the beacon coordinates.

287
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,420
- Exactly.
- I saw it...

288
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,632
It's some sort of vessel.

289
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:49,040
- Jack, Mission's almost offline.
- I'm under it now.

290
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,890
Mission, we have an unidentified
object impact in 17,

291
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,700
it came down to coordinates sent by
a scav beacon. My tech's on route now.

292
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,370
Tower, we're going offline soon,

293
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,840
but drones are already mobile and executing.

294
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,390
Have your tech stand down.

295
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Copy.

296
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,490
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.

297
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,640
That's a negative, Tower!

298
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,690
With Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.

299
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,230
I want to know this site is secure!

300
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,050
Sally, my Tech is concerned
about the security of the site.

301
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,310
Tower, you have lost enough assets for today.

302
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,620
- Keep your tech out of it. Do you copy..?
- Copy. Command, I...

303
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,620
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this!

304
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,220
I'm on site.

305
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,370
Jack, the drones have eyes on you.

306
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,230
Command's offline.

307
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,560
I think it's one of ours.

308
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,360
This thing is ancient, it looks...

309
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,760
pre-war!

310
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,250
This is scavs, they brought this thing down, Jack!

311
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,860
There's no sign of scavs.

312
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,620
Technician, this is your control.
I order you to pull out

313
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,920
and return to the Tower immediately.

314
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,980
Touching down!

315
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,880
They are human!

316
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,020
Tower, we've got survivors.

317
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,740
There are four, check it, five survivors.

318
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,740
They are human!

319
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,100
Stand down!

320
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,570
- Vica, the drones are firing at survivors.
- Jack, the Tet's offline, I....

321
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,230
I don't have control!

322
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Stand down!

323
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,940
Jack Harper, Tech-49

324
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,980
Back off, you son of a bitch!

325
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Back off!

326
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,010
Open the door!

327
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,990
Vica!

328
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,240
Get the med case.

329
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,330
Get the med case!

330
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,310
This has to be reported.

331
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,790
Then you should report that the drones
killed the crew from one of our own ships.

332
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,740
See what Command makes of that.

333
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,260
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.

334
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,150
Jack...

335
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,590
Here. You're still dehydrated.

336
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,620
Where are we?

337
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,770
I'm Victoria.

338
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,970
This is Jack.

339
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,090
What's your name?

340
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,210
Julia.

341
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,800
Julia...

342
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,810
I'm sorry for what I have to tell you...

343
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,200
But you were on a crash.

344
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,000
Your ship came down.

345
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,090
Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.

346
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,740
But none of your crew survived.

347
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,640
What do you mean?

348
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,110
You're the only one that made it.

349
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,850
I'm sorry.

350
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,850
You've been in delta sleep for a long time.

351
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,750
Some disorientation is normal.

352
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,020
How long?

353
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,530
60 years.

354
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,020
At least.

355
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,890
I have to get back to the ship.

356
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,420
It's too dangerous down there,
you need to rest.

357
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
Vica...

358
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,750
Don't touch me!

359
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,210
Your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon.

360
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,510
From the surface.

361
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,670
You know anything about that?

362
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,210
What was your mission?

363
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,260
It's classified.

364
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,800
But we have no record of an Odyssey's...

365
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,210
I can't tell you anything until I get
the flight recorder from my ship.

366
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,330
Julia,

367
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,480
a lot's changed in 60 years.

368
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,440
When you were in delta sleep,

369
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,110
Earth was attacked.

370
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,060
We call them scavs.

371
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,040
They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

372
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
Then they invaded.

373
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,480
We won the war.

374
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,690
But Earth was ruined.

375
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,820
Everyone's on Titan now.
That's the moon of Saturn, we're on the...

376
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:07,230
space station getting ready to go.

377
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,080
We're here for the security
and drone maintenance.

378
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,970
We're the mop-up crew.

379
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,030
You lost people. Everything.

380
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,490
If you want to be alone, we understand.

381
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,140
The drones killed her entire crew.

382
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,340
- If I hadn't gotten there...
- I want her gone first thing.

383
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,340
Vica...

384
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:16,930
Do you have any memories before the mission?

385
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,700
Before the security wipe?

386
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,450
Our job is not to remember.

387
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,150
Remember?

388
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,450
Do you remember her?

389
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,450
Jack...

390
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,860
That was a scav beacon that brought her down.

391
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,470
We don't know who she is.

392
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,510
Or what she is.

393
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,840
Let's just get trough the night.

394
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,070
Okay?

395
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,480
You fly that thing?

396
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,320
Yes.

397
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:44,480
What happens now?

398
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,960
Tet will be online soon...

399
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,070
Victoria will report your rescue.

400
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,840
And they'll send someone down for you.

401
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,380
From the Tet?

402
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,380
Yes.

403
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,040
I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.

404
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,680
The scavs, they move at night.

405
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,730
- They could be all over...
- I need to know what happened.

406
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:18,360
You need to know what happened.

407
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,610
Please!

408
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,970
Jack. What are you doing?

409
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,790
Vica, she is a flight officer.

410
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,640
She wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder.

411
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,980
- Now you'd want the same thing.
- <i>Jack...</i>

412
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,580
I can't protect you.

413
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Yeah, I understand.

414
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,310
This one's on me.

415
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,300
I couldn't save them.

416
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,800
Jack. Jack!

417
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,990
Jack, can you hear me?

418
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,220
Alright, it's time to go.

419
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,420
Jack!

420
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,420
I found it.

421
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,610
Jack!

422
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:15,200
Tower 49, how are you all this lovely morning?

423
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,640
Another day in paradise.

424
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,800
Sally...

425
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
Jack...

426
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,660
took a pre-doom patrol,

427
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,880
and...

428
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,070
went off comm.

429
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,870
Near the canyons in 17.

430
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:38,010
Now, I know we're low on drones.

431
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,180
But, um...

432
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,930
Requesting one to sweep the area.

433
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,180
Just a quick scout!

434
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,940
Copy 49, tasking 185 to grid 22.

435
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,940
And how can a man die better
Than facing fearful odds,

436
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,940
For the ashes of his fathers,

437
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,940
And the temples of his gods?

438
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,040
I've been watching you, Jack.

439
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,590
You're curious.

440
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:03,470
What are you looking for in those books?

441
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,700
Maybe it will bring back old memories?

442
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,150
You won't get anything from me.

443
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,880
My memory's been wiped to protect...

444
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,380
Security of your mission? Yes.

445
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:20,920
You can't have your precious memory
falling into the wrong hands, now can you?

446
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,440
Tell me.

447
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,570
Have you ever met a...

448
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:28,070
Scav up-close?

449
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,480
Of course not.

450
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,220
You just repair drones.

451
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,660
Don't go in to the radiation zone.

452
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,500
Don't ask too many question.

453
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:45,150
A part of the job description.

454
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,460
Lights!

455
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,270
We are not aliens, Jack.

456
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,240
We are human.

457
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,540
Of course for us, being human is a problem.

458
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,840
Old steel fighter tech.

459
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,260
Shielder from your scanners.

460
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,520
Focus scrambler.

461
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:35,260
Keeps your drones confused.

462
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,400
Well...

463
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,540
Most of the time.

464
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,340
- The drones are programmed...
- To kill humans, Jack!

465
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,650
You saw what they did to those sleep box.

466
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,620
You almost got yourself

467
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,620
blown to bits protecting that woman.

468
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,200
Why did you do that?

469
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,080
Anyone would have.

470
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,930
Anyone?

471
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,050
- Interesting...
- We're wasting our time.

472
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,090
The drone will track him here.

473
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,170
Sergeant Sykes.

474
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,980
He thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.

475
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,940
I hope you'll prove him wrong.

476
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,936
Mission, I'm picking up a biotrack
somewhere near the west canyons,

477
00:55:34,937 --> 00:55:36,170
can you confirm the sequence?

478
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,970
Stand by.

479
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,880
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.

480
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,630
Vica, you're okay?

481
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,200
Everything good between you two?

482
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,600
Of course!

483
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,460
You're still an effective team?

484
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,380
We're great!

485
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,070
Never better.

486
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,820
We were running a ground
game and losing.

487
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,760
So we decided, what the hell.

488
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,480
We gotta throw the long ball.

489
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,160
It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.

490
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,890
That's how you brought down the Odyssey.

491
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,180
Why?

492
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,700
The Odyssey's compact reactor.

493
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:23,120
Courtesy of NASA, very hard to come by.

494
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,070
You liked the show last night?

495
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:33,310
And it was just one fuel cell.

496
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,390
Imagine what 10 of them will do.

497
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:40,360
With the core of weapon's grade plutonium.

498
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,840
We have a nuke.

499
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,080
We have a drone to carry it.

500
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,460
But we can't access it.

501
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,250
It doesn't know who we are.

502
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,660
But it knows you, Jack.

503
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,930
We need you to program the drone

504
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,760
that will carry our nuke to the Tet.

505
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,150
End this war.

506
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:21,240
There are people up there.

507
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,420
Sergeant...

508
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,040
Program the drone to return to the Tet.

509
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,810
It needs to go right to the center.

510
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,410
Screw you!

511
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,300
We haven't got time for this.

512
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:18,010
No!

513
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,920
- Let's go!
- Get him out.

514
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:37,890
- 185 just went off grid.
- Copy Tower, we're seeing the same thing.

515
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,030
Permission to task two additional drones?

516
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:45,170
If one drone is here, more will come.

517
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,700
They won't stop till they find me.

518
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,020
They'll turn this place to dust.

519
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,930
But if you let us go, I'll call them off.

520
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,500
It's your only chance.

521
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,450
I've been to your radiation zone.

522
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,920
If you're looking for the truth...

523
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:27,170
that's where you're gonna find it.

524
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,300
You risk all our lives.

525
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,020
Everything.

526
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,650
Why do you think he is different?

527
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,600
She does!

528
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,880
Mission,

529
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,890
I found my tech over 37.

530
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,390
You can call off the search.

531
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,920
Copy that Tower, glad Jack's safe.

532
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,590
Tasking the unit drones, back to rig support.

533
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,740
Where're we going?

534
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,500
Who are you?

535
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,650
What aren't you telling me?

536
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:36,740
- Jack...
- What were you doing on the Odyssey?

537
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,810
What was your mission?

538
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,410
It's was a research flight to Titan.

539
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,870
My first.

540
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,620
That's what it was supposed to be!

541
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,950
Six weeks to launch, deep space scanners
picked up an alien object.

542
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,370
We were re-assigned to investigate.

543
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,700
They put us all in delta. They must have...

544
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:08,110
woken you and Victoria first.

545
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,550
What?

546
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,830
That object...

547
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:15,220
was the Tet, Jack.

548
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,670
The Tet was our mission.

549
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,560
That's impossible!

550
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:26,530
That's impossible!

551
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,330
Who are you?

552
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:36,460
I'm your wife...

553
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,290
I don't know what happened!

554
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:45,820
But you're not who you think you are.

555
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:55,690
Jack, we were here.

556
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:58,190
You asked me to meet you.

557
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,850
You brought me up on top of the world.

558
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,020
I could tell you were nervous that day.

559
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,520
It was right here, Jack.

560
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,710
You said...

561
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,320
Look through here...

562
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,000
And I'll show you the future.

563
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,810
And I hold up a ring.

564
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,900
- And you said...
- Yes!

565
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,860
There you are.

566
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,930
There you are.

567
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,460
Vica, I'm coming in!

568
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,050
Do not report to Mission
till I get back, do you copy?

569
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,000
Do you copy?

570
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,020
Vica, open the door.

571
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,210
Stay away from me.

572
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,570
I don't want to hear.

573
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,380
It not safe here, and we need to leave now.

574
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,950
It was always her.

575
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,270
Wasn't it?

576
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,100
Vica...

577
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:38,300
She's my wife.

578
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:55,010
Mission, this is Tower 49.

579
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,630
Go ahead, 49.

580
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,100
- No...
- I'm having a problem with my technician.

581
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,050
- You don't know what are you doing!
- He found a survivor on the crash site.

582
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,900
- Vica, listen to me!
- She's impeding his abilities.

583
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:10,720
And he's unfit for service.

584
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,820
I'm sorry to hear that, Vica.

585
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:17,630
Are you still an effective team?

586
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,170
Vica...

587
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,650
Open the door, Vica!

588
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,490
No.

589
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,270
We are not an effective team.

590
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,570
Vica, please.

591
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,760
You know we have to go now.

592
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,820
No, I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack!

593
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,570
There's a place I know...

594
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,190
We'll be safe.

595
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,060
I'm going to Titan.

596
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,050
There is no Titan.

597
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,450
They were lying to us.

598
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,450
Just stay away from me!

599
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,490
Vica, please.

600
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:16,500
There are things...
Things you need to know.

601
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,730
I don't want to know.

602
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,600
Jack.

603
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,770
Hi, Jack.

604
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:08,440
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

605
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,420
What have you done?

606
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,950
You can't blame yourself for this.

607
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,600
Drones are unreliable.

608
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,060
Sometimes things go wrong.

609
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,170
Go wrong?

610
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:23,210
You killed her.

611
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,720
I know.

612
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,160
It's tragic.

613
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,410
She was a wonderful person.

614
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:31,830
Jack, we want to bring you here.

615
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,560
I've been authorized to tell you,
we're going to asign you a new mission.

616
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,690
You and the survivor.

617
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,710
There's a lot of interest up here.

618
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:48,850
Bring her up.

619
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,200
We can debrief and anything's possible!

620
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,740
It's time to go home, Jack.

621
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,300
Jack?

622
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,100
Jack...

623
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,250
Jack.

624
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,250
I'm sorry.

625
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,190
Hang on!

626
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,740
Lightning.

627
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,930
That's the plan.

628
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,820
We need cover!

629
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,820
There!

630
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,790
Are you okay?

631
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,190
No!

632
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,970
Don't worry, here we're staying out of there.

633
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:45,730
- Are we gonna die?
- No!

634
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,930
Maybe.

635
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,630
Jack!

636
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,880
Son of a bitch!

637
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,290
Wait here!

638
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,390
Who is he?

639
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:04,550
Hey!

640
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,390
Wait!

641
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:08,290
Wait!

642
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,050
Drop your weapon!

643
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:44,940
Easy.

644
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,620
It's okay!

645
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,780
Don't move!

646
01:17:56,110 --> 01:18:00,390
You have to shut that drone down.

647
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,090
Stop moving!

648
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:03,090
Jack!

649
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,500
It's okay!

650
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,750
Julia!

651
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,750
Julia!

652
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,380
Don't touch me.

653
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,700
Hold on!

654
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,700
Just hold on!

655
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:43,970
Jack Harper.

656
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,320
Tech-52.

657
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,800
There you are.

658
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:04,770
What's happening?
Are you okay?

659
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,880
I thought when you came across
the border that I lost you.

660
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,190
False alarm.

661
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,717
I should get back out there to...

662
01:22:18,718 --> 01:22:21,860
You come all the way home
and I don't get a kiss?

663
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,860
What's going on up there?

664
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,500
I was thinking...

665
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,700
Why don't you come down with me?

666
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:43,330
To the surface.

667
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,120
We can go right now.

668
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,000
Now?

669
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:49,990
Yeah.

670
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,200
Are you serious?

671
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:56,910
You won't believe what's down there.

672
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,540
Jack...

673
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,500
You know the regulations.

674
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,500
Yes.

675
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:12,080
Can we not do this again,
I'm done talking about it.

676
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,080
Okay.

677
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:05,960
This is gonna hurt.

678
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,940
Hell of a day, huh, Bob?

679
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,420
You always loved this song.

680
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,510
I'm not him.

681
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,950
I know I'm not...

682
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,610
But I've loved you...

683
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:08,440
For as long as I can remember.

684
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,820
I don't know how else to say it.

685
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,420
You know what you said to me once?

686
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:25,400
You said, when it was all over,
you'd build me a house on the lake.

687
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:29,850
We'd grow old and

688
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:32,440
fat together.

689
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,070
Then we would fight.

690
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,520
Maybe drink too much.

691
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,720
Real romantic.

692
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:48,110
And then we would die.

693
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:52,740
And be buried in the meadow by the lake.

694
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:58,320
And the world would forget about us.

695
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:04,660
But we would always have each other.

696
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,810
I remember.

697
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,970
Those memories are yours, Jack.

698
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,940
They are ours.

699
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,060
They are you.

700
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:22,970
Good morning.

701
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:32,610
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.

702
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:35,360
You still can.

703
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,230
I have to go.

704
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,220
Those people need my help.

705
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:53,390
We'll come back when it's over.

706
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:56,210
Promise me.

707
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,210
We'll come back when it's over.

708
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,990
You had me worried for a second.

709
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:43,680
I thought you weren't coming back.

710
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:48,170
Well, I had to prove him wrong.

711
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:52,260
You look like shit.

712
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,840
You should see the other guy.

713
01:29:56,010 --> 01:30:00,920
If I told you, what you'd find out there,
you'd have thought I was crazy.

714
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:03,030
I still do.

715
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:07,960
- Malcolm Beech.
- Julia Harper.

716
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,010
Come on...

717
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,970
Mission, I'm picking up a biotrack
somewhere near the west canyons,

718
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,780
can you confirm the sequence?

719
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:28,900
Stand by.

720
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,090
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.

721
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:36,640
Mission, 185 just went off grid.

722
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,530
Copy Tower, we're seeing the same thing.

723
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:54,160
I'd been in the army less than a year
when that unholy thing arrived.

724
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:57,350
Saw the moon get taken up.

725
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:59,660
Right up here in the night sky.

726
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,670
Couldn't believe it.

727
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:07,990
After that, nature took over.

728
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:14,550
There's bed rocks around Chicago, so we were
spared the worst of the waves... quakes.

729
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:18,730
Most people just starved.

730
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,510
And the Tet set crew ships down.

731
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:25,240
The door is opened...

732
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,490
And out you came.

733
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:32,180
Astronaut Jack Harper.

734
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:37,160
Thousands of you.

735
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:40,360
Memory wiped.

736
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,000
Programmed to kill.

737
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:47,470
They had taken one of our best...

738
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:50,890
turned him against us.

739
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,790
No soul.

740
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,970
No humanity.

741
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:04,130
The Tet...

742
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:07,990
what a brilliant machine.

743
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:13,170
Feeding off one planet after another for energy.

744
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,390
Phase two.

745
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:19,220
was drones repairmen.

746
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:27,210
50 years of watching those
Hydro Rigs suck our planet dry.

747
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,880
Then one day,

748
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,800
I saw you sat down.

749
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,200
another the drone to fix.

750
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,730
But in the rubble that day

751
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:42,900
was a book.

752
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,500
You picked it up.

753
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,160
You studied it.

754
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:50,770
And I...

755
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:54,450
thought I saw a way.

756
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:59,730
When you stepped in front of that
drone and saved here...

757
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,400
I knew.

758
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:06,190
You were in there, somewhere.

759
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:11,790
I just had to find a way to bring you back.

760
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,880
Watch it.

761
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:38,660
Give it some space.

762
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,360
Come on, you're making it nervous.

763
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,190
That is one pissed off weapon.

764
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,240
No, it's just a machine.

765
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,650
Oh, I would love to be there
to see that thing's face when this goes off.

766
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:18,610
That would be a one way trip.

767
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:19,610
Yeah...

768
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:22,710
But it'd be worth it.

769
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:44,180
Welcome back, commander.

770
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,920
Open the door!

771
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,870
- Shit!
- Spread out!

772
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,370
I'm okay.

773
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,570
The drone.

774
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,570
Send the drone.

775
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:20,080
It's going in.

776
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:24,620
I though we had it.

777
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:27,640
I really did.

778
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:32,120
I can take the bomb myself.

779
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,350
You know it will swat you like a fly.

780
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,570
Not if I go.

781
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:41,990
No.

782
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:46,450
She asked you to bring me up.

783
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:49,990
So bring me up.

784
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,710
We'll go together.

785
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:12,930
It reminds me of home.

786
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,140
Ready?

787
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,990
Jack.

788
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:09,460
Dream of us.

789
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:17,290
Flight recorder, play back for the Odyssey mission.

790
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,840
3-8, 2017.

791
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:21,730
Okay, Bob.

792
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:24,550
Ready for space.

793
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:39,180
Good morning, Odyssey,
from your friends here in mission control.

794
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:41,760
Morning, Mission!
This is commander Jack Harper.

795
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:43,800
Thank you for that fantastic wake up call.

796
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,610
Pre rendez-vous checks complete,

797
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:48,690
electrical guidance and nav systems are all good.

798
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:52,290
Range behind object 250 clicks.

799
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:55,950
Twelve below V bar closer rate 200 kilometers per hour.

800
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:57,260
Copy that.

801
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:59,070
It's good to see you, Jack.

802
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:02,970
After the very last days of sleep,
sounds like you're ready to go.

803
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:04,820
Oh, I'm ready to go.

804
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:07,350
Your next battle will bring you
up level and to speed

805
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:10,380
at 50 kilometer range where you'll hold.

806
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,670
Copy, we go 50 clicks from object
for sensor scanned evaluation.

807
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,890
Targets look good.

808
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:21,570
Initiating burn in 3...
2... 1... Ignition.

809
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,280
I see a good burn.

810
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:29,590
Are you reading any output from the object?

811
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:33,610
Negative, zero heat. No MR.

812
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:34,900
There's no sign of life.

813
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:36,730
How is the rest of the crew doing?

814
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:39,380
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen should join me shortly.

815
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,800
Rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.

816
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,520
Copy that.

817
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,920
You missed a hell of a game last night.

818
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:49,930
Well I tell you guys no spoilers
about last nights game.

819
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,430
I'm looking forward to watch it when i get back.

820
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:54,530
You're not talking about football already, are you?

821
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:57,230
- Good morning, Vica.
- Good morning, Sally.

822
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:59,380
How are you doing this lovely morning?

823
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:01,540
Another day in paradise.

824
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:10,930
For the history.

825
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:25,100
Tech-49.

826
01:45:25,210 --> 01:45:27,510
I have you on approach.

827
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:28,910
Hello, Sally.

828
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,620
It's a busy morning, huh?

829
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:37,050
I'm picking up a second passenger, Jack.

830
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,700
It's Julia Rosakova.

831
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:45,580
Female survivor from the crashed module.

832
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,290
Stay your intention.

833
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:50,660
Deliver the survivor

834
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:52,290
as requested.

835
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:54,160
We are

836
01:45:56,290 --> 01:45:58,290
more effective team.

837
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,760
Proceed entering.

838
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:09,430
Mission, we got a situation.

839
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:13,740
The last burn was spot on to give us
a 50 click hold from object.

840
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:16,430
But radar range still decreasing.

841
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,930
We are accelerating toward the object.

842
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,680
We're gonna need full house burn to pull away.
Initiate now.

843
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:24,120
Enter target.

844
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:26,640
- Set.
- Target's good.

845
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:28,670
- All forward engines.
- Engines on.

846
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:30,450
Ready? Let's go!

847
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:43,270
Mission, we're on full house burn,
trying to back out.

848
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:45,760
There's a lot of vibration.

849
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:47,870
We're not getting away
from this thing.

850
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,390
Odyssey, telemetry shows structural over-stress.

851
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:52,120
Shut off the burn.
Do you copy?

852
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,750
Getting off burn.

853
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Mission?

854
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:01,880
Sally?

855
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,920
Increased acceleration toward the object.

856
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,730
Estimating contact within two minutes.

857
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:15,280
I'm going to eject the sleep module.

858
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:17,550
It's programmed for insertion
into Earth orbital.

859
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:20,580
Now flight command module oughta
vibrate free.

860
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,730
- I want you back there now.
- Absolutely not.

861
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,210
- That's an order.
- Jack, no, we're team!

862
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:50,430
We gotta go, Jack!
30 seconds!

863
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,110
Dream of us.

864
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:37,130
Jack...

865
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,970
Tech-49, enter at headway speed.

866
01:48:57,790 --> 01:48:59,770
Entering at headway.

867
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:18,390
Welcome back.

868
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:21,460
Don't go all shaky on me.

869
01:49:55,310 --> 01:50:00,250
Jack, I can't help notice your respiration
and heart rate have increased.

870
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:04,150
I'm just exited to finally meat you, Sally.

871
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:09,200
There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.

872
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,700
Yeah.

873
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:14,140
I feel bad about that.

874
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:19,370
Your voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.

875
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:23,090
Tell me why you're here.
You have 5 seconds.

876
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:33,710
I want Julia to live.

877
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:37,290
And our species to survive.

878
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:40,540
This is the only way.

879
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:49,700
Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.

880
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:50,630
Welcome home, Jack.

881
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:08,650
Jack, you're doing the right thing.

882
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:10,880
I don't know what you are

883
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,630
or where you're from, but...

884
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:17,000
How about I tell about something I've read.

885
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:19,680
A story.

886
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,050
From Rome.

887
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:24,380
A city you destroyed.

888
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,640
It's a classic.

889
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,380
There was a guy...

890
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:31,730
Horatius.

891
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:34,950
He held the bridge alone against a whole army.

892
01:52:35,210 --> 01:52:37,740
And what Horatius said was:

893
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,190
"How can a man die better..."

894
01:52:40,330 --> 01:52:42,190
You don't have to die, Jack.

895
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:44,700
She doesn't have to die.

896
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:46,810
Everybody dies, Sally.

897
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:49,230
The thing is to die well.

898
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:02,580
Jack, that's not the survivor you've promised me.

899
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:05,070
No, it's not!

900
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,780
And what

901
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:31,370
Horatius said was:

902
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,640
"How can a man die better

903
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,830
Than facing fearful odds,

904
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:43,290
Drone! Get inside!
Get inside!

905
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:46,360
For the ashes of his fathers,

906
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:51,300
And the temples of his Gods?"

907
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:08,220
Fuck you, Sally!

908
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:00,760
<i>Earth</i>

909
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,150

911
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:12,840
<i>I wonder if I come to you at night in dreams.</i>

912
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:14,800
<i>And the day</i>

913

918
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,230

<i>they're made of the love we share.</i>

<i>Because I know him.</i>

926
01:56:39,890 --> 01:56:41,730
<i>I am him.</i>

927
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,710
