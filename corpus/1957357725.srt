1
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:10,801
(classical violin music)

2
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,953
- Ooh.

3
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,110
Oh hello.

4
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,102
I'm Fredrick Michaels,

5
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:39,430
and welcome to Found Footage Theater.

6
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,253
- [Director] Um, it's
Tales of Found Footage.

7
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,210
- I know, I was trying to add some class

8
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,963
to this unrefined little film.

9
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,773
May I continue, please?

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,843
Thank you.

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,890
As I was saying, I'm Fredrick Michaels,

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,550
an accomplished thespian,

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,590
trained in the classic
Shakespearean theater style,

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,790
and you may remember me
from my many performances

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,313
on Broadway or at the Royal
Opera House in London.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,450
And now I'm hosting

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,063
Tales of Found Footage.

18
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,573
Fuck my life.

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,390
Did you know, I've been nominated

20
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,750
for multiple Tony and
Laurence Olivier awards

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,030
for my performances, fantastic productions

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,280
guided by excellent directors,

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,693
not like this fucking
tosser behind the camera.

24
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,935
Oh, you're making yet another
Found Footage horror movie.

25
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:41,460
Oh, I'm original.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,610
And what's with you young
people and your fascination

27
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,050
for found footage?

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,890
Found footage?

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,753
I call it low-budget rubbish!

30
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:52,950
But I digress.

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,870
And since I'm being disgustingly underpaid

32
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,620
to host this crap, I'll
give you what you want.

33
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,620
So please, send the kids off to bed,

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,838
sit back, relax and turn off the lights.

35
00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:10,255
(classical violin music)

36
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,817
I said turn off the bloody lights!

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,520
And prepare yourself as I regale you

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,450
with three stories of terror

39
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,700
presented to you in found footage style.

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,161
Go, turn it off, change your
channel to something better.

41
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,411
- Do it quickly.
- Fredrick!

42
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,970
- Our first story tonight
comes from something

43
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,490
you young people are also fascinated with,

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,210
an online challenge.

45
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,550
Hashtag this challenge,
hashtag that challenge.

46
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,393
It's a bloody pound sign!

47
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:50,250
And in this tale, two teenage girls

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,870
take it upon themselves
to attempt a challenge

49
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,283
that nobody has been able
to complete thus far.

50
00:02:57,755 --> 00:03:00,307
For good reason.

51
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,724
(classical violin music)

52
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,690
I thought you were gonna fade out.

53
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,480
- [Director] Um, the title?

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,970
- Oh bloody hell, wretched bastards,

55
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,273
I present to you, Hashtag the Challenge.

56
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,420
- Hi, I'm Delaney.

57
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,830
And I'm Sarah.

58
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,680
- And we are going to be doing

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,740
the Hotel Alexandria Challenge.

60
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,430
- It's this super cool
challenge that all the kids

61
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,600
at our school are doing.

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,980
- But none of them have completed it.

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,650
Not a single one.

64
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,590
And, um.

65
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,556
- Do you know anyone who've done it?

66
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,860
- Yes, yes, Ryan did it.

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,693
It's just--

68
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,169
- Ryan did it?

69
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,930
- Yes, that's the thing, that's the thing.

70
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,400
He tried it, and, um,

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,300
so he (laughs), he gets there,

72
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,150
and he rides his bike the whole way there.

73
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,710
He sees a shadow in the
window and just leaves.

74
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,940
- Oh my gosh.

75
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,060
- Like, what?

76
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,530
- That's Ryan for you,
right, all big and macho.

77
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,680
- Literally, wait here, let me show you.

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,150
Like, it's all in the way he walks.

79
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,280
Like, how he's like big and like (grunts).

80
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,600
I play football and I'm so cool,

81
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,690
and you would think that
he's not afraid of anything.

82
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,840
And he just chickened out
at the first sign of like,

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,833
what was that?

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,770
He's a big baby.

85
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,250
- [Delaney] Well you only say
that because you like him.

86
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,330
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

87
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,890
- No, I don't, Delaney, that's not fair.

88
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,783
You can't just.

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,283
Can you just not tell anyone?

90
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,120
- [Delaney] I won't tell anyone.

91
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,119
- And can we please delete
that outta the final cut?

92
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,270
(laughing)

93
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,931
- [Delaney] Yeah, yeah of course.

94
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,890
(laughing)

95
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,090
- Okay, okay, can we just get back to it?

96
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,923
- [Delaney] Yeah, yeah yeah.

97
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:56,756
- Let me, hold it.

98
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,972
All right, the Hotel Alexandria.

99
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:01,805
- Woooo.

100
00:05:02,874 --> 00:05:04,160
- The challenge is you have to make it

101
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,860
all the way up to the fourth floor,

102
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,910
and then all the way down,

103
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,090
and you have to record
the whole thing for proof.

104
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,210
- And it's all like
abandoned, and like haunted.

105
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,470
- Yes, yes, and, do we say anything

106
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,940
about the ghost lady, or is that like?

107
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,390
- Eh, I mean there's like this ghost lady

108
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,160
who supposedly like roams the halls.

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,918
- And she died in the hotel.

110
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,021
- Woooooooo.

111
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:27,447
(laughing)

112
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,460
- But who knows if we'll
run into her or not?

113
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,890
We're recording the whole thing, so

114
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,220
you guys'll find out if you stay tuned.

115
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,400
- Yep.

116
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,233
Is that it?

117
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,198
- Yeah, wish us luck.

118
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:39,865
- Wooooo, bye.
- Bye.

119
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,501
(laughing)

120
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,793
- [Sarah] It's this one right here.

121
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,870
- Holy shit.

122
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,120
- [Sarah] Oh my God.

123
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,440
- [Delaney] Are you sure
this is the right one?

124
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,540
- [Delaney] This is the place.

125
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,373
Oh my God.

126
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,350
- [Sarah] Delaney, I don't
know if I wanna do this.

127
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,240
- Are you seriously chickening out?

128
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,920
- [Sarah] It's just,
it's late, and I'm like.

129
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,043
- We walked like 15 minutes
to get here, like in the rain.

130
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,630
Are you serious?

131
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,658
- [Sarah] I just like, it's, I don't know,

132
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,488
I'm scared and I feel stupid.

133
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:21,800
- What about Ryan?

134
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,740
If like he couldn't do it and you do it,

135
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,936
he'll think you're like really cool.

136
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,210
(phone ringing)

137
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,400
- [Sarah] Who's that?

138
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,360
- It's my mom.

139
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,470
- [Sarah] What are you gonna tell her.

140
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,740
- I don't, I'm sleeping
over at your house.

141
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,903
- [Sarah] Wait, no no no no no.

142
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:35,890
- I'm sleeping over at your house.

143
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,390
I'm sleeping over.

144
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,860
Hey, Mom, hey.

145
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,313
Um, I'm sleeping over
Sarah's tonight, okay?

146
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,793
What are you--

147
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,527
No, I--

148
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,280
Mom, we've talked about this, seriously.

149
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,683
Pick me up, or I'll walk.

150
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,903
Ten.

151
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:55,948
Okay.

152
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,300
- [Sarah] Man.

153
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,750
- We're gonna do this,
okay, we're gonna be fine.

154
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:06,203
- Here we go.
- Are you ready?

155
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:08,680
- Yeah, okay.
- I guess.

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,220
- [Delaney] Let's go, let's go, let's go.

157
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,823
- [Sarah] All right, first floor.

158
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:15,660
Jesus, it's cold.

159
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,400
It's absolutely freezing.

160
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,203
It's like worse than outside.

161
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,850
(footsteps)

162
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,773
This place looks like it's
from the 18 freaking hundreds.

163
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,703
Everything's just old and weird.

164
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,553
- [Delaney] Take a look at that baby.

165
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,700
- [Sarah] Ugh, where are its eyes?

166
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,313
I hate this, I absolutely
freaking hate this.

167
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:46,980
- [Delaney] Dammit.

168
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,813
- [Sarah] What?

169
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,410
- There's no cellphone service.

170
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,540
- [Sarah] Are you kidding me?

171
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,800
Delaney, we have to go home

172
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,130
if there's no cellphone service.

173
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,070
- We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

174
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,970
Don't be a baby.

175
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,599
- [Sarah] What do you mean,
what if something happens?

176
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,080
- Stop being a chicken.

177
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,880
We're fine, we're gonna
get through this, okay?

178
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,850
Just, just calm down.

179
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,103
- [Sarah] God, okay.

180
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,320
The clock's stopped.

181
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,020
I don't know why I would
think it would be going, but.

182
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,953
Hey look.

183
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,663
- Yo.

184
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,383
I think this is a phono-graph.

185
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,020
So I think what you do
is you turn the crank

186
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,130
and it plays music on the discs.

187
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,700
- Yeah, like, I've seen them in movies,

188
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,280
just never in real life.

189
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,730
- [Delaney] Well, here it is.

190
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:47,655
- Kinda cool.

191
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,670
- [Delaney] Hey, try and see if some

192
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,917
of the doors are locked.

193
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,352
- Locked.

194
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,030
That's really stupid,
when you think about it.

195
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,480
Like, think of how easy
it was to get in here.

196
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,870
I mean, the door was practically open.

197
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,573
But then, all of these
doors have to be locked.

198
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,650
I don't know, it's just my opinion, but.

199
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,500
- [Delaney] Yeah.

200
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,590
- Look at the little, I don't know,

201
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,660
it's like the talky holes
at church, in confession.

202
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,180
- [Delaney] Yeah, I get it.

203
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,922
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

204
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:30,470
(laughing)

205
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,803
I don't know, this whole place is weird.

206
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,850
- [Delaney] Stand a little
closer to the portrait.

207
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,133
She looks exactly like you.

208
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,563
Like, spot on.

209
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,300
- I don't like this.

210
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,000
That's, I don't.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,830
I don't like that kinda
stuff, can we just keep going?

212
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,960
I think we should keep going.

213
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,100
- [Delaney] Yeah, I'm sorry.

214
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,253
- No, it's fine and I'm
just being stupid, it's.

215
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,460
I just really don't like things like that.

216
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,300
- [Delaney] No, I get it.

217
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,023
- [Sarah] Okay, thank you.

218
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,173
All right.

219
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,563
So far so good.

220
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,280
- [Delaney] Hey, try that door.

221
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,230
See if it's locked.

222
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,633
- Locked.

223
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,500
- [Delaney] Down here then?

224
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,680
- [Sarah] Sure.

225
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,530
- [Delaney] Okay.

226
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,590
- [Sarah] It's so cold.

227
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,480
- [Delaney] It's worse
than the other floor.

228
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,390
How's that even possible?

229
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,293
- [Sarah] Look at this.

230
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:45,883
That's so weird.

231
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:48,333
- [Delaney] That's strange.

232
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,348
(door slamming)

233
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,246
Oh my God.

234
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,579
(panicking)

235
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,940
Oh thank God.

236
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,840
- [Delaney] Sarah?

237
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,799
(hard breathing)

238
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,860
- [Sarah] My God.

239
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,740
- [Delaney] Sarah, what are you doing?

240
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,787
- [Sarah] Oh my God.

241
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,110
- [Delaney] Why are you?

242
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,160
- [Sarah] I don't know, I just wanna see.

243
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:10,384
What the hell?

244
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,070
- [Delaney] Screw this,
Sarah, we're going home.

245
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,903
- What?

246
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:16,540
- [Delaney] We're going home.

247
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,125
- We, we.

248
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,958
But.

249
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,618
What the f--

250
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:25,856
- [Delaney] What's happening?

251
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:26,902
Sarah, we're going home.

252
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:29,703
- No, no, now you have
think about this rationally.

253
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:32,677
This is an old abandoned hotel.

254
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:35,330
The wiring's probably all weird.

255
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,370
It's, the draft from
the door made it swing.

256
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,460
You can't just like, it's, there's

257
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,023
no reason to panic over this.

258
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,090
God, we came all the way here.

259
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,670
We can't just give up now.

260
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,430
We broke into this freaking hotel.

261
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,290
We made it to the second floor.

262
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,407
We, we--

263
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,750
Come on, can we just finish this?

264
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,883
This is stupid just to
freak out over a chandelier.

265
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,003
Please.

266
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,030
- [Delaney] Okay.

267
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,303
We're gonna be okay.

268
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,763
- Yeah.

269
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,520
We're fine, let's just go.

270
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,273
- [Delaney] Let's do this, okay, come on.

271
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,813
Perfect.

272
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,020
- What?

273
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,210
- [Delaney] My phone glitched.

274
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,260
It's been doing that.

275
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,440
- [Sarah] Oh, mine's fine.

276
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,690
- [Delaney] I haven't updated in a while.

277
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,093
That might be what it is.

278
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,463
- Ugh, no more slamming doors.

279
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,550
Yeah, I don't know, that's weird, but

280
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,655
really it's probably just a
bug that you haven't figured.

281
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,090
Oh that is weird.

282
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,940
- [Delaney] Yeah.

283
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
- [Sarah] All right.

284
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,793
This is the

285
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,813
third floor.

286
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,313
Second to last.

287
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,143
Okay.

288
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,823
- [Delaney] Each floor is
definitely colder than the last.

289
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,340
- [Sarah] For real.

290
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,700
(hard breathing)

291
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:29,567
Ugh.

292
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,235
- [Delaney] Sarah, can
we please turn around?

293
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:34,623
- [Sarah] Oh, yeah, totally.

294
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,560
- [Delaney] Oh, I'm sorry, that was me.

295
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,783
- It's okay.

296
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,859
- [Delaney] After we're
done the fourth floor,

297
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,520
I just wanna go straight down.

298
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,453
- [Sarah] Definitely.

299
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,823
- [Delaney] Just go home.

300
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:09,561
(floor creaking)

301
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:15,252
- [Sarah] It's like everything
has a layer of dust over it.

302
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:20,252
- [Delaney] No kidding.

303
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,803
- You know what?

304
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,320
I have an idea.

305
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,313
Um, okay.

306
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,560
Hey, guys, so we're on
the third floor right now.

307
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,130
- One more floor to go.

308
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,720
- Yeah, and it's creepy as shit, but, um,

309
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,093
we're doing pretty good.

310
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,230
- That door's cracked.

311
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,033
- And we'll, uh, show
you guys what's inside.

312
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,453
Yeah, um.

313
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,913
Okay, okay.

314
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,530
It's really just like a normal room.

315
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,363
- [Sarah] What's in it?

316
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,693
- I don't know, like a bed,

317
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,233
a dresser and a bathroom.

318
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,610
Lamp, chair,

319
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,773
ugly wallpaper.

320
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,150
- What does the wallpaper have on it?

321
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,950
- It's all birds and flowers.

322
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,970
It really looks like a room

323
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,620
in someone's grandmother's house.

324
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,070
I don't know why I thought it
would be scary or something.

325
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,880
Sorry to disappoint.

326
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,420
Um.

327
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,463
Yeah.

328
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,680
(door closing)

329
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,878
- Okay.

330
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,033
- Um, looks creepy, totally harmless.

331
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,220
Um, we're going up to
the fourth floor now,

332
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,400
so keep watching and you'll see it all.

333
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,693
- Bye.
- Bye.

334
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,020
- [Sarah] Last one.

335
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,753
- [Delaney] Let's just get this over with.

336
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:51,530
- [Sarah] What the hell?

337
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,430
- [Delaney] What's that?

338
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,263
Look.

339
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,180
Nobody mentioned a fifth floor.

340
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,030
- If it's not in the
challenge we're not doing it.

341
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,283
Let's just go and let's just finish this.

342
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
- [Delaney] I just wanna go home.

343
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,753
- Me too.

344
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:17,254
Almost there, though.

345
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,520
Next hallway, come on.

346
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,890
We film this last one for proof,

347
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,573
and then we are out of here.

348
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,033
- [Delaney] You're right.

349
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,637
- [Sarah] Then we did
it, and then we go home.

350
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,603
- [Delaney] Sarah, I,
I think that's enough.

351
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,513
Let's go.

352
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:50,500
(door slamming)

353
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,413
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

354
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,873
- [Sarah] What the hell?

355
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:54,706
- [Delaney] Oh my God.

356
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,470
- [Sarah] Was that always like that?

357
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,620
- [Delaney] Sarah, that was not there?

358
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,140
- [Sarah] Well are you sure?

359
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,590
- [Delaney] Don't go near it!

360
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,753
Are you sure it wasn't there?

361
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,023
- [Sarah] Delaney?

362
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,363
Delaney?

363
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,003
Delaney?

364
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:28,471
(gasping)

365
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:32,380
- [Deep Voice] It's okay, Sarah.

366
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,737
Everything's fine now.

367
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:37,331
- Delaney!

368
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,822
(footsteps)

369
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:43,177
Delaney?

370
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,427
(thumping)

371
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,712
(moaning)

372
00:17:57,334 --> 00:18:00,180
(screaming)

373
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,582
(footsteps)

374
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,915
(panicking)

375
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:11,176
(door slamming)

376
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:13,855
(hard breathing)

377
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,628
(crying)

378
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,773
(door pounding)

379
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:19,358
No, don't, please please stop!

380
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:20,775
Go away, go away!

381
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,036
(weeping)

382
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,820
Okay, um.

383
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,320
I haven't heard anything in a while,

384
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,850
and I'm gonna try and go down there

385
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,713
and I'm gonna try and find Delaney.

386
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,433
I don't know.

387
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,060
I just thought I'd make this

388
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,410
just to say that this whole thing

389
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,943
was just such a big mistake.

390
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,630
And we were just so stupid and

391
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,043
we didn't know what we were doing.

392
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:16,228
(crying)

393
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:21,570
But I have to go down there
and I have to find her because

394
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:26,710
I don't know, we promised
we wouldn't leave

395
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,673
without her, she's like my sister, I.

396
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:32,643
I have to.

397
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,583
I just wish we never came here.

398
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:46,679
And I just wanna go home.

399
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,762
(crying)

400
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:53,005
(sniffling)

401
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,700
Just God, please let her be okay,

402
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,777
and just let this visit be
okay, and just let us leave.

403
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:04,589
(crying)

404
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:12,172
(deep breathing)

405
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:16,436
Okay.

406
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:21,613
I'm gonna go now.

407
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:32,866
(deep breathing)

408
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:44,210
(door closing)

409
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,043
Shit.

410
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:03,506
(deep breathing)

411
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,113
Delaney?

412
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,113
(phone ringing)

413
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:14,203
Oh my God.

414
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:16,962
(footsteps)

415
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:19,629
(phone ringing)

416
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:23,612
Delaney?

417
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:26,996
(thumping)

418
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,100
(hard breathing)

419
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,667
I don't know.

420
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:39,376
(hard breathing)

421
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:48,477

423
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:20,694
Delaney?

424
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,417
(phone ringing)

425
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:29,515
(phone ringing)

426
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,906

427
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:41,574
Delaney, is that you?

428
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:45,510
(door creaking)

429
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,760

(footsteps)

433
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,715
- [Delaney] Sarah?

434
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:19,410
- [Sarah] Delaney?

435
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,243
- [Delaney] Sarah, help me please.

- All right, three, two, one.

473
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,670
It's been over a month
since Delaney Torrance

474
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,630
and Sarah Grady went missing.

475
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,890
Now unfortunately for the Torrance family,

476
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,850
Delaney has yet to be found.

477
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,500
Now after Sarah was discovered
wandering the streets

478
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,030
just days after the
incident, she was little help

479
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,700
to police and didn't have
any details of the events

480
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,970
or even the whereabouts
of her best friend.

481
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,740
But we're gonna get to the bottom of this

482
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,690
and answer those questions for you.

483
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,400
So join me, Whitney
Stone, for an exclusive

484
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,820
first on-camera interview with Sarah Grady

485
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,540
and her family to talk
about the details of that

486
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,740
fateful evening that
the girls went missing.

487
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:38,434
(door knocking)

488
00:26:38,434 --> 00:26:41,017

489
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,603
(door knocking)

490
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:52,120
I mean, there's cars in the driveway.

491
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,270
They know we're coming.

492
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:57,867
All right, let me knock again.

493
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,624
(door knocking)

494
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:03,190
(bird calling)

495
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,453
Let's just try to go
in, see what's going on.

496
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:09,140
(door creaking)

497
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,373
Hello, is anybody home?

498
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,040
Sarah?

499
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,930
It's Whitney, is anybody home?

500
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,622
Hello?

501
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,153
Oh my God!

502
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:22,203
Oh my God, what the fuck,
we have to get outta here!

503
00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:23,984
(screaming)

504
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:26,234
(grunting)

505
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:32,038
(thudding)

506
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:47,383
- Are you serious?

507
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:49,720
Is this what I'm hosting?

508
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,460
Teenage girls getting possessed

509
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,070
and hacking up their parents?

510
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:56,060
How deplorable!

511
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,263
What kind of sick individual
thinks up this shit?

512
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,493
Well, honestly.

513
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,301
And what's wrong with
you people for watching?

514
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:07,863
Is this how you get your
jollies, your rocks off?

515
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,520
Oh, look at me, I'm a horror fan!

516
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,130
I love gore and violence.

517
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,520
Ha.

518
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,107
I'm befuddled.

519
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,230
Don't you want some
refinement in your cinema?

520
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,600
No?

521
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,433
I see.

522
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,803
Well this will make you
happy, you sick fucks.

523
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:30,562
Our next tale is about an
unlucky-in-love American male

524
00:28:30,562 --> 00:28:34,270
who decides to go the
unconventional route.

525
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,170
Probably because he's
a sick fucking pervert

526
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,020
like the rest of you.

527
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,030
To find the woman of his
dreams from the internet.

528
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,623
I now present you Mail Order Bride.

529
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,860
- [Matt] Hooch, tonight's the big night.

530
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,403
Are you just like so excited?

531
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:57,130
Tell us what's going on.

532
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,251
- Tonight's the night, tonight
I pick up my new bride.

533
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:02,957
- [Matt] That's right.

534
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,550
- Ah, I can't wait, it's been months.

535
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,383
It's been, it's here.

536
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:08,760
- Well, of course, I bet
you're very happy about it.

537
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,673
- Yes, I am, see.

538
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:11,534
- [Matt] Of course he's happy,
look at him, he's glowing.

539
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:12,367
- And you, you're happy too, right?

540
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,730
- [Matt] Smiling from ear to ear.

541
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,360
- Of course, it was all your idea?

542
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,340
- [Matt] Well, it was
my idea, but you know.

543
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,910
Listen, it wasn't easy
convincing him, but.

544
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,650
- Do you understand what you got him into?

545
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,220
- [Matt] I absolutely
understand what I got him into.

546
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,221
- I don't think you do.

547
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:28,250
- [Matt] What are you talking about?

548
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,381
I got him, how gorgeous is this woman?

549
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,890
- Oh very, very.

550
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,330
- This is human trafficking.

551
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,920
- [Matt] Oh come on, human trafficking?

552
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,440
- Seriously, where is she from?

553
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,718
- Romania?

554
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:42,398
- Romania?
- Romania.

555
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:43,967
- Yes, what's wrong with that?

556
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,680
- Are you guys serious, Romania?

557
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,870
Have you heard those stories?

558
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,290
Have you seen those documentaries?

559
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,580
My friend, Romanian girl,
pretty much experienced

560
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,020
that through her, firsthand,
they sell those women.

561
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,700
They get your money, they rip you off

562
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,570
and then they treat them very very poorly.

563
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,290
- [Matt] Well quick
disclaimer, I don't watch

564
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,904
any documentary unless
it's on a porn site.

565
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,382
- Oh, God.

566
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:08,215
Jesus.

567
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:10,307
(laughing)

568
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,123
This is a very shady business.

569
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:14,960
There are so many women out there.

570
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,060
You can go out and meet them.

571
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,290
You don't have to spend your money.

572
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,440
- [Matt] He's tried that,
he's been dating for years,

573
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,073
he's done the bar scene, the
dating apps, the dating sites.

574
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,101
Speed dating, remember the
time you did speed dating?

575
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:27,940
- We all have been.

576
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,400
- [Matt] He's tried that stuff for years,

577
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,460
nothing's worked, he's
not getting any younger.

578
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,630
I mean, come on, how much
longer is he supposed to wait?

579
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,630
- He has time, all right.

580
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,463
- [Matt] He doesn't have that much time.

581
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:39,710
- Just because it was your
idea, you got him into this

582
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,890
and now somebody's telling you it's

583
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,387
a bad, bad, bad idea, you're
trying to defend yourself.

584
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,270
- [Matt] I'm not trying to defend myself.

585
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,792
I legitimately think it's a good idea.

586
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,566
- You're a very chauvinistic
person, did you know that?

587
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:51,780
How about if I told you that?

588
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,613
- [Matt] Listen, I, listen.

589
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:55,290
- You treat women as meat.

590
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,440
Body, face.

591
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,460
- [Matt] See this is
where I'm calling fraud.

592
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,340
Because women treat men as meat,

593
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,390
and women have treated him as meat,

594
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,970
because how many times at a bar,

595
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,180
tell me, how many times
at a bar has a girl

596
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,390
like been flirting with
you, gotten a free drink

597
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,700
outta you and then walked
away with some other dude?

598
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,629
- Oh, it's like almost all the time.

599
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:14,665
- Look, guys, it happens on both sides.

600
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,410
- [Matt] I'm telling you, women
take advantage of men too.

601
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,390
- Well, okay, I'm not arguing with that.

602
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,223
- [Matt] Okay, thank you.

603
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:20,860
- It sometimes happens,

604
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,760
but it doesn't mean he should stop trying.

605
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,300
- [Matt] It just happens a lot to him.

606
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,306
That's why we're going down this path.

607
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,139
- No, I don't think so.

608
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:28,833
Yeah, you know what happens to him also?

609
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,500
He gets persuaded by people like you

610
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,610
to get into this very shady affair.

611
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,480
- [Matt] Is it my fault
I have a better haircut

612
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,700
and he listens to me more?

613
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,860
- Oh, God, goodness gracious.

614
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,860
You know how serious bad guys are behind

615
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:48,600
that type of businesses?

616
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,050
They sell those women.

617
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,170
You're gonna get ripped off.

618
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,450
- [Matt] He hasn't been sold.

619
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,450
He's been video chatting
with her for months.

620
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,983
Hooch, in all the times
you video chatted with her,

621
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:01,750
has she seemed under duress,
under slavery at all?

622
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,780
- No, it's all her own doing, all right.

623
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,916
It's a mutual thing.

624
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,450
- You know what, I'm
pretty sure she's gonna,

625
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,660
she's not gonna be there.

626
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,890
And when you go to meet her,

627
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,630
it's gonna be somebody else.

628
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,510
- [Matt] What are you
saying, a guy showing up?

629
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,950
- Well maybe, I don't know.

630
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,783
I don't know, maybe nobody will show up.

631
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:16,960
- [Matt] Well it's a good
thing I'm going with you then.

632
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,510
- That's right, we can just drive away.

633
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,900
- Yeah, oh, of course you can protect him,

634
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,410
if you know, if some shady
people, I don't know.

635
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,234
- [Matt] Listen, this is a gorgeous girl.

636
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,340
I personally looked at the pictures.

637
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,620
I won't tell you how many times.

638
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,382
But this is a gorgeous girl,
and I'm going with him,

639
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,326
I'm going with him to the airport.

640
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,979
- Good girl, good looking.

641
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,197
- [Matt] Listen, there's no more risk.

642
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:39,900
- It's very a light, light chance,

643
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,810
slight chance that this girl's gonna be

644
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,550
really good person as she appears to be.

645
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,860
- [Matt] Hooch, I'll check her for weapons

646
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,165
when she gets off the plane.

647
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,134
(laughing)

648
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:50,967
If you know what I mean.

649
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,150
- Very funny, guys,
you know where I stand.

650
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,860
I don't like the idea.

651
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,340
I think you shouldn't have done that.

652
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,600
You shouldn't have, you
know, gotten him into it.

653
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,200
- [Matt] I'm just saying you
take just as much a chance

654
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,940
meeting a girl at a bar
or a dating service,

655
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,962
or, or whatever, it's
just as much a chance.

656
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:10,355
- No, and why does he
need to spend his money?

657
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,531
- [Matt] This way, there's a nice little,

658
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,530
he said himself, it's a
nice little mutual situation

659
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,830
where she gets something out of it.

660
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,520
She probably just wants citizenship.

661
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,173
You get something out of
it, you finally get laid.

662
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,390
- Yeah, what about glove?

663
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,461
What about heart and soul, why are we?

664
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,120
(laughing)

665
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,953
- [Matt] What are we, in kindergarten?

666
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:29,259
Love? Love doesn't, come on.

667
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,620
How much longer is he supposed to wait?

668
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,250
I mean, no offense, he's not
a spring chicken anymore.

669
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,610
- Wow, heart and soul.

670
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,810
- [Matt] How much longer
is he supposed to wait?

671
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,283
It's not a matter of love.

672
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,240
Look, I mean, listen, God willing,

673
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,950
you too fall in love and
live happily ever after.

674
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,905
- Oh yeah, of course, do you believe that?

675
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:47,870
- [Matt] But let's face the reality.

676
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,671
She's really hot, let's face the reality.

677
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:52,100
- No, that's a bad idea.

678
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,921
I don't like that.

679
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:55,740
- [Matt] No, but this might
be his last chance at kids.

680
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,380
- Bail out, unless, you
know, until it's too late.

681
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,880
Please bail out, I beg of you.

682
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,773
- My mind's made up,
it's happening tonight.

683
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:04,780
- [Matt] He's a big boy, see, no no no,

684
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,340
you can't blame me on
this, it was just my idea.

685
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,977
He's a big boy, this took
months of convincing.

686
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:11,010
You're a big boy, this was your idea?

687
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,843
- Yes, it was.

688
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:12,810
- [Matt] Are you good to go?

689
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,643
- Yes.

690
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:14,476
- [Matt] He's good to go.

691
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:15,950
- We both know it was your idea.

692
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,940
- [Matt] Yes, I agree to that.

693
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,190
I can't argue.

694
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,823
Yeah, and you convinced
him and now he's sold.

695
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,960
Sweetie, I want you to be happy.

696
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,873
But, this is not the right way to go.

697
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:34,027
- [Matt] I say getting
laid'll keep you happy

698
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:34,866
on a regular basis.

699
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:37,806
(laughing)

700
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:38,639
- Ahh.

701
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,330
- [Matt] Hooch, we are
like 10 minutes away

702
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,473
from actually picking her up.

703
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,943
How pumped are you now?

704
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,920
I mean, this is it, dude,
this is like the finish line.

705
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,440
- Yeah, I'm very pumped.

706
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,210
I mean, it's like it's finally here.

707
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,320
It's like the last few
days have been just--

708
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,500
Because it was getting so
close, and I'm just like,

709
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,118
okay, it's here, it's here,
all right, all right and now.

710
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:14,170
- [Matt] Are you nervous, are you nervous,

711
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,178
are you nervous?

712
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:16,796
- A little bit, of course, sure, you know,

713
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:19,670
because it's easy when you're
video chatting and stuff.

714
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,460
You know, but once now you're
actually seeing face to face,

715
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,894
it's real, that makes it real.

716
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:25,440
- [Matt] And flesh to flesh.

717
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,730
- Exactly, it's a lot different than being

718
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,863
on a video chat when she's
like 7,000 miles away.

719
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,743
- [Matt] Not anymore.

720
00:35:32,743 --> 00:35:33,910
- You know, now she's gonna be literally

721
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,020
standing like right next to me.

722
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,270
- [Matt] Now she's like
seven minutes away.

723
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,483
- Yup, about that.

724
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,810
So, yup, yup, pumped, man, excited.

725
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,340
It's happening.

726
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,703
It's happening!

727
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,710
You know, I shoulda listened
to you a long time ago.

728
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,060
You always said, mail order bride, dude.

729
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,620
What is your, I mean.

730
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,700
- [Matt] Dude, do you realize,
I just wanna say something

731
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,350
because like this was like,

732
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,110
this was like a long
time coming, this idea.

733
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,730
So if you'd listened to me,
do you know how much time

734
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,890
and money you would have
saved by just listening?

735
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,030
Listen, this should be a lesson to you

736
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,130
for the rest of your life.

737
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,770
When I say something, just save yourself

738
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,700
the time and trouble.

739
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,681
- Yeah, but you know,
it's so, but hold on,

740
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:17,514
it's so much, it's--

741
00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:18,347
- [Matt] And listen to me.

742
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:20,020
- I get it, but it's easy

743
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,761
and a way for you to say it because--

744
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:23,195
- [Matt] And when this
pays off the way I think

745
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:24,028
it will, you're gonna be--

746
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:25,000
- Listen, and you know what?

747
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,010
I'll be saying, oh yeah,
shoulda done it sooner and all.

748
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,650
But you know what, though, it's easier,

749
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,230
it's easier said than
done because, you know,

750
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,180
I'm used to doing things a certain way.

751
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,310
You know, you're always in,

752
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,890
people naturally like have a comfort zone,

753
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,760
and it's not even the, it's just being

754
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,930
in a different environment
and trying something new.

755
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,660
But you're right, you're
right, I mean, yeah.

756
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,200
I mean, yeah you're right.

757
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,170
Of course, you always been nagging me

758
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,003
about it for how long now?

759
00:36:50,003 --> 00:36:51,840
- [Matt] I pulled you
outta your comfort zone

760
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,040
and it's gonna pay off royally.

761
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,460
- I mean, I tried everything else.

762
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,350
I tried, the bar scene is terrible.

763
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,460
Dating apps suck.

764
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,971
It's the same people that
are on there for ages.

765
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,270
The speed dating thing was ridiculous.

766
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,560
I'm like, what the,
what was that all about?

767
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,770
- [Matt] That's what's
great, and now, here it is.

768
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,380
Payoff time.

769
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,463
- Oh, by the way.

770
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,910
Might as well get this outta the way now.

771
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,560
- [Matt] You're taking Viagra?

772
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,393
- No.

773
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:19,226
- [Matt] Cialis?

774
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:22,653
- No, when I introduced myself,

775
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,830
I didn't introduce myself to her,

776
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,950
she doesn't know me as Hooch.

777
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,453
She knows me as Rich.

778
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:31,713
- [Matt] What?

779
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,160
You haven't been Rich in 30 years.

780
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,410
- Well I'm Rich now.

781
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,010
Tonight, I'm, hey.

782
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,070
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, pump the brakes.

783
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,060
Hold on a minute, I gotta get this right.

784
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,320
Bullshit.

785
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,342
Wait, so this girl's like
laying down the law already?

786
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:48,763
- No no no no no no no no.

787
00:37:48,763 --> 00:37:52,180
- [Matt] I want you by your proper name.

788
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,740
- No no no, nope, nope, nope nope nope.

789
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,457
Nothing to do with her.

790
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:58,500
- [Matt] Did she threaten you like Drago?

791
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,470
- No no, no no no, this was all me.

792
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,880
I did it because I felt, I was thinking,

793
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,870
oh my God, I'm gonna
say Hooch to this girl?

794
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,890
Like, she might, be like, Hooch?

795
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,723
- [Matt] Wait, wait wait.

796
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:10,080
So she's never heard the name Hooch?

797
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,750
In all the months you've been chatting,

798
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,100
she's never heard the name Hooch.

799
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,531
- Never came up, never came up.

800
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:15,897
Nope.

801
00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:17,010
- [Matt] Get the fuck outta here.

802
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,270
- Nope, never came up.

803
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,820
- [Matt] Oh, dude, you
know I'm ratting you out?

804
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,900
- Oh, that's fine.

805
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,510
Listen, hold on, when she gets here,

806
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,520
I felt it's obviously gonna come up.

807
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,430
It's a big part of me.

808
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,567
- [Matt] Of course it's gonna come up.

809
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:32,310
- But I figured tell her my
real name, who I really am,

810
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,550
and then somebody, one of my friends, you,

811
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,563
or somebody else.

812
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,770
- [Matt] It's on your license
plate, for God's sakes?

813
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,577
- Well, I didn't think of that one.

814
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:43,790
But oh well, oops.

815
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,913
Uh, yeah, all right, so.

816
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,890
Listen, I just felt like by using Rich

817
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,610
it was more, I felt proper, it was all me.

818
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,320
I just felt maybe it was like
being nervous at the time,

819
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,263
maybe I just was overthinking
things a little bit.

820
00:38:58,263 --> 00:38:59,920
- [Matt] Oh, you're
definitely overthinking.

821
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,933
Dude, she's tightening you up.

822
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:05,931
- No she's not, it's
nothing to do with her.

823
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,270
Nothing at all.

824
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,599
It was about me.

825
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,868
- [Matt] She's bringing about changes,

826
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:13,210
and I don't like it.

827
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,840
- Listen, it was about me.

828
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,970
I figured once she's here,
I'll tell her I'm Hooch.

829
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,680
- [Matt] Dude, I am
never calling you Rich.

830
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,890
- That's fine, I'm not asking you to.

831
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,778
But, you know, and then
once she's here, she can--

832
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,611
- [Matt] Dude, at your wedding day,

833
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:26,370
when the priest says, do you, Rich?

834
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,810
I'm gonna be like, it's Hooch.

835
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,493
- Oh and by the way, nice hair.

836
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:34,122
(laughing)

837
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:34,955
- [Matt] What the hell does that?

838
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,220
Listen, listen, listen.

839
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,990
Okay, all right, I see what you did there.

840
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,640
A little diversion tactic, that's fine.

841
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,360
- No, nice hair, really, seriously.

842
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,030
- [Matt] Of course it's nice hair, dammit.

843
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,940
Listen, I know this is your girl,

844
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,820
I know this is your
thing, but there's no way

845
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,910
I wasn't gonna, I was gonna go with you

846
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,440
to meet like a hot Euro
and not do my hair.

847
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,848
Listen, I still need to look good.

848
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:57,486
- Oh no, that, that's, I mean.

849
00:39:57,486 --> 00:39:58,850
- [Matt] I have a fragile ego.

850
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,730
- I mean, listen, I'll let
you have the hair thing,

851
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,450
being I didn't use the Hooch.

852
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,283
- [Matt] Okay.

853
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:05,247
- So you can have the hair thing.

854
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:06,920
If you need to rat me out
on the Hooch, you can.

855
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,950
- [Matt] Oh I am.

856
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,270
- I don't care, it's whatever,

857
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,323
but listen, this is finally
happening, we're minutes away.

858
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:15,720
7,000 miles away is now like, literally--

859
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,570
- [Matt] Seven blocks.

860
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,810
- Yeah, seven, eight blocks

861
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,050
down the street, and that's it.

862
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,850
- [Matt] But wait, wait wait, wait.

863
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,780
I do wanna clear up one
other thing, though.

864
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,913
We still have our arrangement, yes?

865
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:27,746
- Ohhhh.

866
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,237
Oh, what arrangement now?

867
00:40:31,237 --> 00:40:33,150
Oh, this should be good.

868
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,201
Come on, what's the arrangement

869
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:37,188
you claim that I'm down with?

870
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:40,470
- [Matt] The one while
you're having sex with her

871
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,650
I get to watch from your closet.

872
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,143
- Excuse me?

873
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:45,460
(laughing)

874
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,520
Oh sure, right, okay.

875
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,340
- [Matt] Listen, listen,
just, while you're doing it,

876
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,244
just if you hear a
rattling in your closet,

877
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,713
just tell her to ignore it.

878
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,160
- I'll just tell her that's my friend Matt

879
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,050
getting his hard-on.

880
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,760
- [Matt] Just tell her to ignore it,

881
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,927
and I promise I will
clean up any mess I make.

882
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:07,380
- What's that big bang in your closet?

883
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,573
Um, nothing, something fell
off the shelf, I don't know.

884
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,950
Oh come on, man, you know what?

885
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,250
That's all I need, right, she's there,

886
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,650
we're getting it on
intimately, passionately,

887
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,540
in private, so she thinks.

888
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,670
- [Matt] And I pop out naked.

889
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,444
- Oh my God, dude, she's
going right back to Romania.

890
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:26,460
That's what gonna happen.

891
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,650
- [Matt] I'll rent that
big teddy bear costume,

892
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,483
and I'll pop out like that.

893
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:31,537
- All that money and all those video chats

894
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:33,323
are all gonna be flushed down the toilet

895
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:35,360
for your two minutes of
gratification, right.

896
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,840
Seriously, right?

897
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,790
- [Matt] Wait, what makes you think

898
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,180
I can last two minutes?

899
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:42,991
You tell me she's supposed
to meet you out front?

900
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:45,843
- [Hooch] Yeah, right over here somewhere.

901
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,013
In front of the terminal.

902
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:51,009
- [Matt] Is that her?

903
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,316
- [Hooch] Yeah, who's that, what?

904
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:55,730
- [Matt] Is it her, are you sure?

905
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,563
- [Hooch] Yeah, that's her.

906
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:57,630
- [Matt] Dude, she brought a friend.

907
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,170
- [Hooch] Whoa.

908
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,003
- [Matt] Dude, she's hot.

909
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:01,410
- [Hooch] Oh no.

910
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,223
- [Matt] Oh my God, dude, I'm so in.

911
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:04,640
I am so in.

912
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,520
Look at, oh my God, look at that.

913
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,740
Dude, I'm so in.

914
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,159
Quick, let's get out,
quick, hurry up, hurry up.

915
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,659
(car beeping)

916
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,716
I can't get out quick enough.

917
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:21,966
(laughing)

918
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,442
- Hello.
- Hello.

919
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:32,305
- How are you, finally?

920
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:33,321
- I know.

921
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:34,793
- Finally, you're here, wow.

922
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:36,570
- I know, wow.

923
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,570
- And you brought a friend?

924
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,950
- Yes, yes.

925
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,270
- [Matt] Like, is anybody
gonna introduce me,

926
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,836
or am I just like chopped liver?

927
00:42:42,836 --> 00:42:45,677
- I'm Nicoletta, and this is Mihaela.

928
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:46,510
- [Matt] Matt.

929
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,343
- Oh.

930
00:42:47,343 --> 00:42:48,433
- [Matt] Matt, sorry, say that again?

931
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,457
- Mihaela.

932
00:42:49,457 --> 00:42:51,320
- [Matt] Mihaela, oh my God, oh.

933
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,652
Wow, very good to meet
you too, oh my goodness.

934
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:57,187
- No, she doesn't speak English.

935
00:42:57,187 --> 00:42:58,240
- [Matt] Oh, no English?

936
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,795
- No.
- All right, even better.

937
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:01,860
(laughing)

938
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,630
- [Matt] Good, I don't have
to be clever all night.

939
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,962
Oh my God, you guys gotta
be tired and hungry.

940
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:08,450
- Yes, yes.

941
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,680
- [Matt] Dude, hey, let's
take them to the pub.

942
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,923
Get some dinner and drinks,
absolutely, here it is.

943
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,160
- [Matt] All right, guys, bring it in

944
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,676
to Hooch and Nicoletta.

945
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:26,821
(glasses clinking)

946
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:29,771
To a long happy relationship,
it's been a long time coming.

947
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:33,426
- Ahhhh.

948
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:39,281
- [Matt] I don't know if
she can hold her liquor.

949
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:40,339
- Yes I can.

950
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:41,916
- [Matt] She looks like she
was choking on that one.

951
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:42,757
- Stop.

952
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:44,260
(laughing)

953
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,070
- [Matt] So you guys are
finally, finally together,

954
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,800
after like months of anticipation.

955
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,953
Hooch, what are your thoughts, man?

956
00:43:51,953 --> 00:43:54,267
- Oh man, it's amazing, she's here.

957
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,433
- I'm here.
- She's right here.

958
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,310
- [Matt] Look at this.

959
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,360
So now, like, he said that he told you

960
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,320
that his real name is Richard.

961
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,500
- It is.

962
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,680
- [Matt] I know it is,
but at the same time,

963
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,770
his nickname is Hooch, so
now are you gonna start

964
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,120
trying to make me like
call him like Richard now?

965
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,490
Because I don't know if I
can make that adjustment.

966
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,490
- Whatever he wants.

967
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,070
- Look at that, huh, ah, nice.

968
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:21,423
- [Matt] I believe they
call that a jackpot.

969
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,430
- Cha-ching, yes.

970
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:27,255
(balls breaking)

971
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:30,530
- [Matt] Oh, okay, I guess
that's how they shoot in Romania.

972
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,950
So, is it Mi-ha-ella?

973
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,850
Am I saying that right?

974
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,410
Oh, okay, okay cool, I got it right.

975
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,610
Mi-ha-ella, Mi-ha-ella.

976
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,080
If I say it too fast, I screw it up.

977
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,260
Mi-ha-ella, there it goes.

978
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,543
It's like a tongue twister, I can't do it.

979
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,471
Oh my God, so what do you think?

980
00:44:48,471 --> 00:44:51,370
What do you think, do you like it here?

981
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:53,023
USA, do you like it here?

982
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,443
USA, yes?

983
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,740
Okay, cool, cool, all right.

984
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,313
You like it here, clearly.

985
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,110
How long was your flight?

986
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,363
It was from Romania, how long was that?

987
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,700
Okay, but you're from
Romania, yes, Romania?

988
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,910
Yes, yes, Romania.

989
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,490
Okay, yeah, we're making
a little progress.

990
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,513
Uh, uh.

991
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,440
Ah shit, I don't know what to say.

992
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,900
Oh, what do you think of Rich, Richard?

993
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,043
Do you like Richard?

994
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,643
Richard?

995
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,163
Nicoletta fiance?

996
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,880
Nicoletta, I got you to nod to Nicoletta.

997
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,023
We have word recognition.

998
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,753
Okay, you know what?

999
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,300
I am gonna go get you another drink,

1000
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,650
so you just sit there and keep
nodding and smiling, I guess.

1001
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,607
All right, I'll see you.

1002
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,573
Wow, that went well.

1003
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,240
Hooch, don't think too much about it,

1004
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,033
just find a shot and go for it.

1005
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:06,580
It's not like you're
gonna embarrass yourself

1006
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,330
in front of your new, oh, wait a minute.

1007
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,163
Maybe you will.

1008
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,660
Oh boy, look at this.

1009
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,673
The happy couple.

1010
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:19,170
Hooch is in heaven right now.

1011
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,683
He is so happy.

1012
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,000
Oh my God, it's like he struck gold.

1013
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,718
He just, he couldn't be much happier.

1014
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,443
He is in good.

1015
00:46:30,443 --> 00:46:32,113
This is awesome, look at this.

1016
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:35,505
All he has do is--

1017
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,840
She's like completely locked
in on him, it's great.

1018
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:42,421
He's like so happy.

1019
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:45,336
You know what?

1020
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,793
Good for him, good for my boy.

1021
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:50,622
Oh my God, unbelievable.

1022
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:54,393
Oh, he is so getting laid.

1023
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,450
All right, Hooch, your bride-to-be,

1024
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,000
let's see if she can get a shot in,

1025
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,150
anything at this point.

1026
00:47:05,308 --> 00:47:07,600
(laughing)

1027
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,130
All right, Hooch, you give it a shot.

1028
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,913
Can somebody get a ball
in, any ball at all.

1029
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,633
At this point, I'll take the eight-ball.

1030
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,790
Hooch, Hooch, Hooch, come
with me for a second.

1031
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,150
I'll bring him right back, I promise.

1032
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,143
I'll bring him right back.

1033
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:27,380
Stop stop stop, stop stop.

1034
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,630
Dude, what do you think?

1035
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,483
- Oh my God.

1036
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,070
Incredible.

1037
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,540
More beautiful than even in the photos.

1038
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,820
Dude, I'm like wow.

1039
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,653
- [Matt] Dude, she's awesome.

1040
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:38,486
She's like perfect.

1041
00:47:38,486 --> 00:47:41,616
- Holy man, it is something, just wow.

1042
00:47:41,616 --> 00:47:45,050
I just can't believe it took
me so long, man, to just--

1043
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:48,130
I shoulda done this a long time ago.

1044
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,713
- [Matt] Dude, what are you
gonna do to that perfect body?

1045
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:56,223
- Oh, that's freaking messed up (laughs).

1046
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:58,550
I mean, I'll keep it in good form, but.

1047
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,120
- [Matt] Dude, and the
other one's like hot,

1048
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,260
but it's like pulling
teeth talking to her.

1049
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,010
- Yeah, she's quiet, yeah.

1050
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,090
- [Matt] She doesn't
speak a lick of English.

1051
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,700
- She understood something
like, when you mentioned me,

1052
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,105
and USA, that's it, nothing else.

1053
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:09,938
- [Matt] That's all I'm getting.

1054
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:11,410
- Yeah, sorry, man.

1055
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,820
- [Matt] But I will be getting more later,

1056
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,300
I promise you that.

1057
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,900
But like, dude, she's
like, dude, I got an idea.

1058
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,220
So it's like, you'll have your girl,

1059
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,480
we'll go back to your apartment,

1060
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,170
I'll hook up with the other one.

1061
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,623
And dude, so like halfway
through, we'll switch.

1062
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,543
And that way I get to have both.

1063
00:48:27,543 --> 00:48:28,823
- We'll what, excuse me?

1064
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:31,143
Hello, um, um, no.

1065
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,040
I think one's taken already.

1066
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,347
- [Matt] But you see, you see,

1067
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:37,480
you shoulda done this a long time ago.

1068
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,380
- Oh no, absolutely.

1069
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,550
I mean, I'm like, but I'm stubborn,

1070
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,530
and you kept trying to push me and push me

1071
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,370
till finally I'm just like, just do it.

1072
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,040
Just, just, and I think
it's the best thing

1073
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,330
I've ever done in my whole life.

1074
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,469
I don't know, I'm just like.

1075
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,140
- [Matt] I'm happy for
you, I'm happy for you.

1076
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,640
- Absolutely, man, this is it.

1077
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,230
It's a new beginning for me.

1078
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,930
Finally, what I been
looking for my whole life.

1079
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,103
- Good, good for you.

1080
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,040
All right, guys, ready?

1081
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,940
One,

1082
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,540
two, three.

1083
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,853
- [All] Romania!

1084
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,820
- [Matt] Hooch, you got the keys, right?

1085
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,410
- [Hooch] Yes, I do, right here.

1086
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,730
- [Matt] Good, that would be bad.

1087
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,480
- [Hooch] Ready to roll, of course.

1088
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,503
You cannot forget the keys.

1089
00:49:21,646 --> 00:49:23,979
(whistling)

1090
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:26,265
Over here.

1091
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,693
All righty, come on in.

1092
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,550
Watch your step right here.

1093
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,829
Be careful right there, watch yourself.

1094
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:39,412
- [Matt] Thank you.

1095
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:43,069
- All righty, right this way.

1096
00:49:47,314 --> 00:49:48,481
Down this way.

1097
00:49:54,015 --> 00:49:54,932
All righty.

1098
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,223
Make yourselves comfortable right here.

1099
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,393
Right here will do.

1100
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,207
All righty.

1101
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:05,984
Ohhhhh.

1102
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,920
- [Matt] Sorry, ladies.

1103
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,169
Hooch, let me borrow you
for one sec, one sec.

1104
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:12,002
- All righty.

1105
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:12,835
- [Matt] Sorry.

1106
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:13,668
- I shall return.

1107
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:14,770
- [Matt] We'll be right back, I promise.

1108
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,338
- [Hooch] All righty, be right back.

1109
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:19,671
(footsteps)

1110
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:23,936
- [Matt] Dude, come here,
come here, come here.

1111
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:27,220
Dude, dude, dude, you
gotta take the camera

1112
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,850
for a little bit.

1113
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,058
- Huh, why?

1114
00:50:30,058 --> 00:50:32,530
- [Matt] Dude, I wanna hook
up with his Mihaela chick.

1115
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,370
- Oh come on, really now?

1116
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,250
- [Matt] Dude, I've been
filming all night, man.

1117
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,120
Just for a little while.

1118
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,230
Plus, plus, plus, dude,
you get to like film her.

1119
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,399
You get to film her.

1120
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:43,232
- All right, all right.

1121
00:50:43,232 --> 00:50:44,540
- You get to keep the camera on her.

1122
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,280
- All right, you sold me.

1123
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,090
- [Matt] Good, good.

1124
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,760
- [Hooch] You happy now?

1125
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,653
- Uh, yes I am.

1126
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,550
- [Hooch] So now what do you wanna do?

1127
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,883
- Show me your bedroom.

1128
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,610
- [Hooch] Hold on, let me just check.

1129
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,103
Oh, he's fine.

1130
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,433
- I have a surprise for you.

1131
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,353
I'll be right back.

1132
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,720
(door knocking)

1133
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,620
- [Hooch] Come in.

1134
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,800
Wow!

1135
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,410
- You like what you see?

1136
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,090
- [Hooch] Yes, very much.

1137
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,012
- I choose it for you.

1138
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:59,440
- [Hooch] I don't even
know what to say, but wow!

1139
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,090
- You don't have to say anything.

1140
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,130
You know, ever since you choose me,

1141
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,780
I've been waiting for this night.

1142
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,743
I'm going to make you so happy.

1143
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,403
Give you everything you
want, everything you desire.

1144
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,883
I'm going to make all of
your dreams come true,

1145
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,050
make you never want another
woman again, I guarantee it.

1146
00:52:26,086 --> 00:52:28,790
I'm going to do very bad things to you.

1147
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,533
I'm going to make you feel
things you never feel before.

1148
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,853
You have no idea how
hard it's been to wait.

1149
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:44,094
I want to taste you.

1150
00:52:58,325 --> 00:52:59,937
Mmmmm.

1151
00:52:59,937 --> 00:53:02,104
(panting)

1152
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,236
Mmmm.

1153
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:08,069
Mmmm, oh.

1154
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,436
Haaaa.

1155
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:15,822
Haaa.

1156
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:17,195
(slurping)

1157
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,028
Haaaa.

1158
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,184
- [Hooch] Ow, ow!

1159
00:53:25,427 --> 00:53:26,740
What the fuck?

1160
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,436
Did you just fucking bite me?

1161
00:53:29,436 --> 00:53:31,930
(laughing)

1162
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,307
What the fuck?

1163
00:53:34,307 --> 00:53:37,008
(laughing)

1164
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:38,210
You did bite me.

1165
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,517
- Of course, I'm from Romania (giggles).

1166
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,970
- [Hooch] I'm fucking bleeding!

1167
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,720
- Actually, Transylvania.

1168
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,000
- [Hooch] What?

1169
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,030
- Remember when we chatted, I
told you I liked heavy guys?

1170
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,117
There's more of you to feed on (laughs).

1171
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:56,473
- [Hooch] You crazy bitch!

1172
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,270
Matt?

1173
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,103
Matt?

1174
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,593
Matt?

1175
00:54:12,593 --> 00:54:13,426
(hissing)

1176
00:54:13,426 --> 00:54:14,581
What?

1177
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,530
(laughing)

1178
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,773
- Leaving so soon.

1179
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,393
- [Hooch] Let me out!

1180
00:54:22,368 --> 00:54:24,535
(gasping)

1181
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:27,768
(choking)

1182
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:33,382
- What's the matter, Richard,
you don't want me anymore?

1183
00:54:33,382 --> 00:54:35,549
(choking)

1184
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:40,251
(hard breathing)

1185
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,330
- How did he taste?

1186
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,130
- I finally shut him up,
and he taste like shit.

1187
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,600
What about him?

1188
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,670
- Not bad, you wanna try him?

1189
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,520
- After I drain this one.

1190
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,203
Be right back.

1191
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,688
- [Hooch] No, please, no.

1192
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:01,521
No.

1193
00:55:01,521 --> 00:55:05,540
- Oh, Richard, you Americans
are such easy prey.

1194
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,200
You're all the same.

1195
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,220
I show you beautiful woman
in provocative outfit

1196
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:15,220
and you are, how do you
say, putty in my hands.

1197
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,040
- [Hooch] No, please, no.

1198
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,900
- Oh you thought you found
the perfect little Euro bride.

1199
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,000
- [Hooch] Please, no, no, please no.

1200
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,760
- Shut up already.

1201
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,284
At least your friend died silently.

1202
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:30,463
- Shh, no, Miha.

1203
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:34,053
It's okay, Richard, this will hurt.

1204
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:35,883
You can scream.

1205
00:55:39,813 --> 00:55:41,896
(biting)

1206
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:46,619
(slurping)

1207
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:49,369
(hard breathing)

1208
00:55:50,335 --> 00:55:52,502
(panting)

1209
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,530
- I must confess.

1210
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,833
I was hoping I was wrong about you people.

1211
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:07,940
But the fact that you're still here

1212
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,180
only confirms my suspicions
that you truly are

1213
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,320
sick, perverted deviants.

1214
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,670
Directors like this twisted
individual hand-feed you

1215
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,640
sex and violence, mix it together,

1216
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,010
and pass it off as horror.

1217
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,920
And you people gorge yourselves on it

1218
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,920
as if it's some delectable
buffet at a Sunday brunch.

1219
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,703
I truly am disappointed.

1220
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,110
What? What does it say?

1221
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:38,880
Make a joke, make a joke about what?

1222
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,570
About this short we just watched?

1223
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,360
It'll make me feel better.

1224
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,620
Surely you jest.

1225
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,070
And there's certainly nothing funny

1226
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,840
in this utter filth being
presented here tonight.

1227
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,890
Your entire film offends
me and my sensibilities.

1228
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,140
I believe I will take my leave of you now.

1229
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:55,973
Good day, sir.

1230
00:56:55,973 --> 00:56:57,670
- [Director] Um, there's one more story.

1231
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,143
- I said, good day, sir.

1232
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,950
What, who are you?

1233
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,060
Let me pass.

1234
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,070
I said step aside, my good man.

1235
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,670
Do not test me, dear boy.

1236
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:13,350
I may be a gentleman,
but I'm quite formidable.

1237
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,741
What, what are you doing?

1238
00:57:15,741 --> 00:57:16,908
No, ahhhhhhhh.

1239
00:57:17,828 --> 00:57:19,241
(banging)

1240
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:20,863
Unhand me, you brute.

1241
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:23,280
(soft music)

1242
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:28,330
As I was saying, I'm absolutely delighted,

1243
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,230
I'm overjoyed to have the privilege

1244
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,410
of introducing the next tale in this utter

1245
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,967
masterpiece of a film, send help.

1246
00:57:36,451 --> 00:57:39,580
Our final story tonight has
us following the exploits

1247
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,000
of three teenage girls as they dabble

1248
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,852
in the art of witchcraft in
order to obtain magical powers.

1249
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:48,485
Call the police, call INTERPOL.

1250
00:57:48,485 --> 00:57:51,687
So without further ado,
I introduce to you,

1251
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:53,543
The Coven, help me?

1252
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,900
- Are you nervous.

1253
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,180
- [Kyla] Yeah, a little bit.

1254
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,030
- Don't be, it's gonna be fun.

1255
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,983
It's a good day.

1256
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,780
We have everything we can do.

1257
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,073
You know, I've been practicing at home.

1258
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:12,000
Have you?

1259
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,833
I told you to.

1260
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:14,510
- [Kyla] Yeah, a little bit, little bit.

1261
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:15,860
- A little?

1262
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,102
Come on, oh my gosh, we talked about this

1263
00:58:18,102 --> 00:58:19,410
that you, honestly if it's not gonna work,

1264
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,590
then it's gonna be on
you because I've been

1265
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,270
working really hard (giggles).

1266
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,140
So, if something does not go as planned,

1267
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,323
you're to blame, sorry, not sorry.

1268
00:58:28,473 --> 00:58:29,330
But no, we should be good.

1269
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,990
I feel confident, you know.

1270
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,197
- [Kyla] Yeah, I think
everything will go good.

1271
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:34,314
- I hope so.

1272
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:35,370
Are you gonna go, sir?

1273
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,730
Yes, cool, awesome.

1274
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,490
Honestly, I just feel good.

1275
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,940
I don't know about you,
I woke up this morning,

1276
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,846
I was excited, I just
wanna get it over with so

1277
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:46,250
I can see the outcome
right away, you know?

1278
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,083
- [Kyla] Uh-huh.

1279
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:49,040
- I've been reading,
I've been researching and

1280
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,480
a lotta people who really care and put

1281
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,820
a lot of effort into it
seem to be successful.

1282
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,460
So I think I have, so

1283
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,300
hopefully, we'll have the same outcome.

1284
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,100
- [Kyla] Yeah, I think we have a good shot

1285
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,580
of making this happen.

1286
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,000
- Me too, I can't wait.

1287
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,585
- [Natalie] Look at her.

1288
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,663
- Yeah, what's up, bitches?

1289
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:24,840
- Hey.
- Hey.

1290
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,910
- Guess what I just found out.

1291
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,743
- [Kyla] What?

1292
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:28,420
- My parents aren't gonna
be home next weekend.

1293
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,870
- Mine aren't either, that's so weird.

1294
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,210
- [Elise] Ooh, we should have a party.

1295
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,470
- We could have it at your
house, because you know,

1296
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,280
my dad has like those
weird security cameras.

1297
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,770
- Oh yeah, damn.

1298
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,300
- [Natalie] Oh yeah,
he'd see like one person

1299
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,494
and he'd like fly right home.

1300
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:44,230
- [Kyla] Oh yeah, we can't do that.

1301
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,063
- [Elise] Well whatever.

1302
00:59:45,063 --> 00:59:45,910
Fuck that, we'll have it at mine.

1303
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,743
- Are you sure?

1304
00:59:46,743 --> 00:59:47,960
- Yeah, I just found out
they're gonna be gone

1305
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,210
the whole weekend, so we're good.

1306
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,473
- There's no way they'd come
early or anything like that?

1307
00:59:51,473 --> 00:59:53,060
- [Elise] No, they have a hotel,

1308
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,560
they have everything, they're set.

1309
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,393
- [Kyla] Really.

1310
00:59:55,393 --> 00:59:56,310
- [Elise] Mm-hmm, they're not coming back.

1311
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,363
- Shit, okay.

1312
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,700
I will give you money for alcohol,

1313
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,810
and I'll help you plan and shit.

1314
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,298
- Awesome, yeah, we can all throw down.

1315
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,800
- Cool.

1316
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,110
All right, well, what about today?

1317
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:05,970
Do you guys feel ready?

1318
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,880
- [Elise] I'm super ready,
I've been so excited.

1319
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,870
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1320
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,563
- Good, me too, I couldn't
even sleep last night.

1321
01:00:11,563 --> 01:00:13,410
I was like, I know, like, I think it's

1322
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,000
a mix of nerves and like excitement.

1323
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,920
- [Elise] Yeah, totally.

1324
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,140
- I think it's mostly excitement.

1325
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,250
I just gotta, you know,
we gotta get it over with.

1326
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,083
See what happens.

1327
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,227
I just wanna see like what the outcome is.

1328
01:00:21,227 --> 01:00:23,160
- [Kyla] Yeah, but this
should be a lotta fun, though.

1329
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,780
- I know, but like, I was researching

1330
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,500
and I was looking at like
what people who tried,

1331
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,360
you know, similar stuff said before,

1332
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,430
and there's a lotta mixed stuff.

1333
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,030
So I feel like if you're
prepared, you know,

1334
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,780
feel good, like I know I do,

1335
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,880
I think we should be okay
for the most part, but.

1336
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,490
- We're ready, let's make the leap.

1337
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,793
Like no more hesitation.

1338
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:43,280
- [Kyla] I know, I just
wanna see results right away.

1339
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,410
- [Elise] You can't do it, who can, so.

1340
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,950
- [Kyla] Exactly.

1341
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,057
We've been thinking about
this for a while now, so.

1342
01:00:48,057 --> 01:00:51,483
- And, if something goes
wrong, I'm blaming it on Kyla.

1343
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,130
You can't fuck us up, okay?

1344
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,690
- [Kyla] I won't, I swear.

1345
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,250
- [Natalie] Rachel's been
like so annoying lately.

1346
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,015
- [Elise] Yeah, like, she's the worst.

1347
01:01:01,015 --> 01:01:02,740
- [Natalie] I don't think
she's really that awful.

1348
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,340
- [Elise] I know she's
been really bitchy lately.

1349
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,630
- You wouldn't think she's that awful.

1350
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,500
You guys were besties back
in your cheerleading days.

1351
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,490
- [Natalie] Yep, I knew you
were gonna bring that up.

1352
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:12,270
You're so funny.

1353
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,223
Cheerleading.

1354
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:15,916
- Yes, our little Natalie,
preppy cheerleader.

1355
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:16,749
- [Natalie] Shut up.

1356
01:01:16,749 --> 01:01:17,582
- [Kyla] Preppy cheerleader.

1357
01:01:17,582 --> 01:01:18,415
- [Natalie] Oh my God,
yeah, look at me now.

1358
01:01:19,814 --> 01:01:20,647
Look at the difference.

1359
01:01:20,647 --> 01:01:21,480
- Oh, I know you got it in you.

1360
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,313
Come on, where is it?

1361
01:01:22,313 --> 01:01:23,146
- Give me an N.
- N.

1362
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:23,983
- Give me an A.
A.

1363
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:26,928
- Come on, join in,
you're the professional.

1364
01:01:26,928 --> 01:01:27,840
- [Natalie] You're the professional bitch.

1365
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,720
- What's next week, ballerina?

1366
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,030
- [Natalie] You know I'm not coordinated

1367
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,933
enough to to that, please.

1368
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,770
I have two left feet, you're funny.

1369
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:39,740
Like I said, guys, this
is why I'm a spooky bitch,

1370
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,050
because I can't do sports, I can't do any

1371
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,660
like, you know, other physical activity,

1372
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,850
cheerleading, whatever, so

1373
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:47,813
I guess I'm goth.

1374
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:49,740
You can relate, right?

1375
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,530
- Yeah.
- Shit.

1376
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,380
- That better not be the only reason.

1377
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,200
- [Natalie] Oh my God,
yeah, I'm sure you guys

1378
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,033
weren't perfect either.

1379
01:01:57,033 --> 01:01:59,069
What'd you do, like
gymnastics or something?

1380
01:01:59,069 --> 01:02:00,620
- [Kyla] I wasn't friends
with Rachel, I know that much.

1381
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,353
- [Natalie] Oh my God.

1382
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,463
- You know who's a weirdo?
- Who?

1383
01:02:11,463 --> 01:02:12,570
- Mr. Burkley.

1384
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,045
- [Natalie] Oh my God, yes he is.

1385
01:02:14,045 --> 01:02:15,327
I really don't like him.

1386
01:02:15,327 --> 01:02:16,160
- [Elise] Such a creep.

1387
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,070
- Gives me a really bad
vibe, and you wouldn't think

1388
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:21,997
like, by now, like, I
know it's not just us.

1389
01:02:21,997 --> 01:02:23,510
I think like a buncha girls
would complain about him.

1390
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,810
I don't know how he still has a job.

1391
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,418
- [Kyla] Exactly, like the things he says,

1392
01:02:27,418 --> 01:02:29,205
like out loud in class, I don't know how

1393
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:30,038
he gets away with it.

1394
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,723
- Oh yeah, I bet he drives a white van.

1395
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:33,210
(laughing)

1396
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,604
No but don't you wonder like,

1397
01:02:34,604 --> 01:02:36,350
that's probably how Sarah
gets her extra credit.

1398
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:37,300
- Probably.
- Yep.

1399
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,280
- [Kyla] That's why she
gets such good grades.

1400
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,320
- [Elise] She has to suck something

1401
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,054
just to not suck at math.

1402
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:44,137
- Ooh, bitch.

1403
01:02:45,431 --> 01:02:46,920
You know what, maybe I should
start kissing up to him,

1404
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,023
though, because I have a
really bad grade in math.

1405
01:02:49,023 --> 01:02:50,396
- [Elise] Yeah I think that's about the

1406
01:02:50,396 --> 01:02:52,053
only thing you could do.

1407
01:02:52,053 --> 01:02:52,886
(laughter)

1408
01:02:52,886 --> 01:02:53,877
- [Kyla] Pretty much.

1409
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:55,460
I don't do any of my
homework in that class.

1410
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,053
- Well I like try, you
just like don't do it.

1411
01:03:00,763 --> 01:03:02,270
- [Kyla] I just wish he
wasn't like so perverted.

1412
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,490
- [Elise] Yeah, I don't
take my orders from a creep.

1413
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,323
No thank you.

1414
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,143
- I don't take orders from anyone.

1415
01:03:08,143 --> 01:03:10,690
- [Kyla] It's so nasty out here today.

1416
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:14,773
- [Natalie] Yep, good thing
we're all wearing black.

1417
01:03:14,773 --> 01:03:16,690
It's so unusual for us.

1418
01:03:17,733 --> 01:03:18,566
I hate summer.

1419
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:21,911
- [Elise] Exactly, all the
mosquitoes and bugs out here.

1420
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:23,533
- [Kyla] I just wish it
was fall so I could wear

1421
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:28,090
combat boots and leggings
without sweating my ass off.

1422
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,610
- [Elise] Wish all the bugs would just go

1423
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,893
in their little homes.

1424
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,950
Well, I guess it's time set up.

1425
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,600
(birds chirping)

1426
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,290
- From east to south and north to west,

1427
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:45,740
I call to you, Hecate,
to attend and bless.

1428
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:49,080
To brew my spells and honor you well.

1429
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,133
With my hand steadfast, my circle is cast.

1430
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:01,060
Hecate, we are gathered here today

1431
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:04,850
to ask that you shine some of your wisdom,

1432
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:09,270
knowledge and power
upon three young witches

1433
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,442
who will be loyal to you.

1434
01:04:11,442 --> 01:04:14,460
(birds chirping)

1435
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,640
We ask that you lend us a hand

1436
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,260
on our guide to witchcraft and help us

1437
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,430
lead a successful, powerful

1438
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,402
path down this journey.

1439
01:04:26,402 --> 01:04:29,152
(birds chirping)

1440
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:35,550
And now we're done, with harm to none.

1441
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:39,630
I inhale the power, at this magical hour.

1442
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,953
Stay if you will,

1443
01:04:41,853 --> 01:04:43,412
but go if you must.

1444
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:46,162
(birds chirping)

1445
01:05:06,864 --> 01:05:08,915
- I don't feel anything.

1446
01:05:08,915 --> 01:05:10,470
- Me either.

1447
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,770
- Give it a minute please.

1448
01:05:12,672 --> 01:05:13,505
- Okay.

1449
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:17,531
(birds chirping)

1450
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,640
- I still don't feel anything.

1451
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:26,506
- Do you wanna try reading it?

1452
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,200
- I'm good.

1453
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,033
- I don't understand,

1454
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:31,653
it's exactly what I wrote
down, word for word.

1455
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,650
Why is it not working?

1456
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,700
- Did it say how long it normally takes

1457
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,070
when you were reading up on it?

1458
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:38,903
- No.

1459
01:05:39,746 --> 01:05:40,600
Were you focusing?

1460
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,940
- Yeah, I was focused.

1461
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:42,883
- Were you?

1462
01:05:42,883 --> 01:05:43,716
- Mm-hmm.

1463
01:05:43,716 --> 01:05:44,549
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

1464
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,150
- I don't understand.

1465
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,533
Fuck.

1466
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,250
- [Elise] So, Nat, I'm just like

1467
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,400
busting with power over here.

1468
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,771
- Same.

1469
01:05:55,771 --> 01:05:58,757
- [Elise] It's coming outta
my fingers, yeah, exactly.

1470
01:05:58,757 --> 01:05:59,870
- Okay, we get it, I know.

1471
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,940
Yeah, I know, but when we try
next time, we should be fine.

1472
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,930
I don't know what we did wrong.

1473
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:05,830
I was ready.

1474
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,901
- [Elise] I was ready too.

1475
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:07,734
- So was I.

1476
01:06:07,734 --> 01:06:08,567
- Are you sure?

1477
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:09,740
Because whoever fucked
up, I know it wasn't me.

1478
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,523
- [Elise] How are you
so sure it wasn't you,

1479
01:06:11,523 --> 01:06:13,480
Miss Can't Do Anything Wrong?

1480
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,313
- That's me.

1481
01:06:14,313 --> 01:06:17,182
Well, you know, I've been
researching every night.

1482
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,130
I've been doing my morning
rituals, my bedtime rituals.

1483
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,160
I've been doing fucking everything,

1484
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,262
cleansing baths, like,
what have you been doing?

1485
01:06:23,262 --> 01:06:25,201
Partying, drinking, smoking, yeah.

1486
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:26,330
- [Elise] I've been doing stuff,
no, I've been visualizing.

1487
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,013
- Oh you've been visualizing, great.

1488
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,980
You're something else.

1489
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,770
- [Elise] I've been
doing rituals, you know.

1490
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:33,840
- Well, listen, I don't know.

1491
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,163
Maybe you just have to fail
the first time and then.

1492
01:06:37,216 --> 01:06:39,440
- [Kyla] The first time, second time.

1493
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,360
- You shut the fuck up, because
I feel like this is you.

1494
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,310
Miss Oh My God I'm Nervous,
I Don't Wanna Do it Yet, no.

1495
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,870
Kyla, my money is on you
because you just need a,

1496
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,030
oh my God, you both, you know what?

1497
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:50,210
Look at you, you're giggling,

1498
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:52,150
you're taking things not seriously.

1499
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,470
- [Elise] You gotta laugh it off.

1500
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:56,010
- Okay, yeah, but not when
you're doing, you know,

1501
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,030
a ritual or something.

1502
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:00,120
Maybe if we took this more
seriously, all three of us,

1503
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,890
shit woulda been more successful.

1504
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:05,120
So, my money's on one
of you two fucking up.

1505
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,070
You laugh at everything,
and you're nervous as fuck,

1506
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:09,210
and I'm fucking ready, so
I know that it's not me.

1507
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:10,470
- [Elise] I'm just having a good time.

1508
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,900
I was ready, I know it wasn't me.

1509
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,710
- Yeah, well, I'm getting
a little desperate here,

1510
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,370
so I'm about to sacrifice a
fucking goat or something.

1511
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:20,590
Because, yeah, I went there, exactly.

1512
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:23,060
So, I don't know, I
just, I feel like shit.

1513
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:27,039
But keep laughing at me,
just kick me while I'm down.

1514
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:27,872
(giggling)

1515
01:07:27,872 --> 01:07:29,163
Yeah, oh ho, really fun.

1516
01:07:29,163 --> 01:07:29,996
- [Elise] You gotta be
able to laugh it off,

1517
01:07:29,996 --> 01:07:31,380
kiddo, come on.

1518
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,980
- God, shut up.

1519
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,773
You're so annoying, you sound like my mom.

1520
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:36,893
(laughing)

1521
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:38,850
I don't know, maybe round two will work.

1522
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,830
I don't know, I guess we
gotta just take a breather,

1523
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:43,900
you know, do some spiritual
like cleansing baths.

1524
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:47,425
Just like relax, I don't know.

1525
01:07:47,425 --> 01:07:48,258
Hopefully it'll work out.

1526
01:07:48,258 --> 01:07:50,042
- [Elise] Yeah, maybe a bath
will give us all our power.

1527
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,451
- Baaa.

1528
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:53,921
I think you need to
fucking take a bath, bitch.

1529
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:56,502
Maybe it'll clean your
attitude up, my God.

1530
01:07:56,502 --> 01:07:58,700
- [Elise] You too, Miss
Blaming It on Everybody Else.

1531
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,160
- Well, listen, I'm, shit.

1532
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:04,310
Okay, whatever, well
I feel like I didn't--

1533
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:07,201
I don't know, I felt the best
I think out of all of us.

1534
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:08,797
- [Elise] How could you know?

1535
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,030
- How could I know, because I put like

1536
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,100
my heart and soul into it.

1537
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,460
- [Elise] And we didn't?

1538
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,160
- No, that's what I'm saying.

1539
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,340
- [Elise] Maybe your doubt in the group

1540
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,640
is what made it fail.

1541
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,200
- Okay, funny, why would
I have reason to doubt

1542
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,557
with you two fucking idiots?

1543
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:23,380
But the thing is, like, look at you.

1544
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,580
Like I'm fucking hurt, and you guys

1545
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,980
are like, oh yeah, next time.

1546
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:30,330
So maybe if you were sad
and you like cared a lot

1547
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:33,140
about it, and you just
put more effort into it,

1548
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,100
it would've worked out the first time.

1549
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,510
- [Elise] Who doesn't care
a lot about acquiring power?

1550
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,343
- [Kyla] Exactly.

1551
01:08:39,343 --> 01:08:40,690
- Well, you don't seem
to be too upset about it.

1552
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,590
- [Elise] I'm upset, I just
don't show it like you.

1553
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,236
I laugh and have a good
time when I'm upset.

1554
01:08:45,236 --> 01:08:46,560
- Okay.

1555
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,920
Well, I guess we all have our
own way of doing shit, but.

1556
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,420
- [Elise] You gotta be a bitchy witchy.

1557
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,673
- I guess so.

1558
01:08:52,673 --> 01:08:54,923
(laughing)

1559
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,153
- Natalie's taking this
really really seriously.

1560
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,023
I mean, like,

1561
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,690
it's not like we're not
gonna try this again like

1562
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:08,393
next week or something, like,

1563
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,703
we're gonna go back, so like,

1564
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,030
I just, I don't know why she's
taking this so seriously.

1565
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:19,623
Like, she's probably the one
that messed it up or something.

1566
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,410
I don't know.

1567
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:30,610
(door knocking)

1568
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:32,117
- [Mr. Boland] Hey, Honey.

1569
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:32,950
- [Natalie] Good, Mr. Boland, how are you?

1570
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:33,802
- [Mr. Boland] Good, how are you doing?

1571
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:34,635
- I'm doing good.

1572
01:09:34,635 --> 01:09:35,850
- Natalie!

1573
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,600
- Hello, how are you?

1574
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,360
- What are you guys up to?

1575
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:44,400
- Oh, we are going to the
woods, casting spells,

1576
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,610
you know, normal stuff.

1577
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,120
- Generation Z stuff.

1578
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,560
- [Kyla] Dad.

1579
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,707
- [Mr. Boland] Just teasing, you guys.

1580
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:52,280
- Are you ready to go?
- Yeah.

1581
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,040
- Can I come too?
- No.

1582
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,477
- [Mr. Boland] Listen,
not too late today, okay?

1583
01:09:56,477 --> 01:09:57,799
- All right, love you.
- No problem.

1584
01:09:57,799 --> 01:09:58,890
- [Mr. Boland] Love you too.

1585
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,780
- [Kyla] It's even worse
out here than last week.

1586
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,733
- [Natalie] Yep, life is disgusting.

1587
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:05,233
- [Kyla] Too many spinny bugs.

1588
01:10:06,232 --> 01:10:07,065
Ooh.

1589
01:10:09,082 --> 01:10:12,209
Just wish it would cool down already.

1590
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:13,760
- [Natalie] I know.

1591
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,780
- [Klya] Maybe we should
waited an extra couple weeks.

1592
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,230
- [Natalie] Yeah, I guess so.

1593
01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:20,805
(footsteps)

1594
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:23,810
- Kyla.
- Hmm?

1595
01:10:24,989 --> 01:10:27,239
(thumping)

1596
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,303
- Yo, I don't think I could do this, man.

1597
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,640
She's only 18, dude,
she's just our friend.

1598
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,280
- [Natalie] I don't wanna
have to do this, either.

1599
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,760
I love her just as much as you do,

1600
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,050
but you need to relax, okay?

1601
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,410
We are not going to get
anything done if you're gonna be

1602
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,910
so hysterical the entire time.

1603
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,470
Just believe.

1604
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:51,660
You have to trust me on
this, this is the only way

1605
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,919
that this can happen, you know that.

1606
01:10:53,919 --> 01:10:54,780
- I don't.

1607
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,780
- [Natalie] This always works, okay?

1608
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,877
- How do you know?

1609
01:10:57,877 --> 01:10:59,840
How do you know, you're
reading from a fucking book.

1610
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,033
This is not a book anymore.

1611
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:02,866
- [Natalie] Elise, you have to believe me.

1612
01:11:02,866 --> 01:11:04,900
You're only gonna freak
her out more, okay?

1613
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:07,095
Please, just relax.

1614
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,400
- I don't know if I can do this, man.

1615
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,483
- [Kyla] What's going on?

1616
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:12,980
What's happening?

1617
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,323
- She's fucking awake.

1618
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:16,784
You can't fucking do this to her, dude.

1619
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:18,407
- Shut the fuck up, you're gonna wake.

1620
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,748
Okay, just stop.

1621
01:11:19,748 --> 01:11:21,801
You're gonna freak her out, okay?

1622
01:11:21,801 --> 01:11:25,480
Here, listen, listen, you hold the camera.

1623
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,813
Hold the camera.

1624
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:29,443
Kyla?

1625
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,230
We have to tell you something.

1626
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,063
- What?

1627
01:11:35,002 --> 01:11:35,920
(crying)

1628
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,513
- We're going to sacrifice you.

1629
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:40,360
- No no no, untie me.

1630
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,730
- I'm so sorry, okay.

1631
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:43,563
Listen.

1632
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,250
Elise and I did research,
and this is the only way.

1633
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,700
We need a virgin sacrifice,

1634
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,980
and you're the only virgin that we know.

1635
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:51,813
- No, no, untie me.

1636
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:53,846
Elise, Elise, please, help me.

1637
01:11:53,846 --> 01:11:56,383
Untie me, untie me.

1638
01:11:57,435 --> 01:11:58,870
No no no, you're fucking crazy.

1639
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:01,250
- I'm not crazy, okay,
no one's gonna miss you.

1640
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,580
We're your friends.

1641
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,920
We're you're only friends.

1642
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,753
Don't you wanna help us on this?

1643
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,800
- What about my sister?

1644
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,830
What about my sister, my little sister?

1645
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,412
Help me, untie me, untie me.

1646
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,109
Untie me, untie me.

1647
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:17,270
- [Natalie] Give me that,
I can't look at her.

1648
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:18,380
- Please, please, help me.

1649
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,310
- [Natalie] This is so you don't have

1650
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,696
to see it coming, okay?

1651
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:21,646
- Untie me, untie me.

1652
01:12:21,646 --> 01:12:23,750
- And so I don't have to
look at you while I do this.

1653
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:24,885
- Untie me, untie me, untie me.

1654
01:12:24,885 --> 01:12:25,718
- [Natalie] It's gonna be okay.

1655
01:12:25,718 --> 01:12:28,135
- [Elise] Untie me, untie me.

1656
01:12:31,568 --> 01:12:33,807
Someone help me out,
please help, please help.

1657
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,390
Untie me, untie me, help, help.

1658
01:12:37,485 --> 01:12:39,255
Help me, please.

1659
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:41,431
Please please please, no no no no.

1660
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:42,626
- I'm sorry, Kyla.

1661
01:12:42,626 --> 01:12:43,942
- [Elise] No no, no no.

1662
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:44,775
- I love you.

1663
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:46,528
I love you, okay?

1664
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,076
- [Elise] No no no no.

1665
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:48,909
No no no.

1666
01:12:51,093 --> 01:12:52,613
(grunting)

1667
01:12:52,613 --> 01:12:55,290
(coughing)

1668
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,680
No, help.

1669
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,500
- Elise, I need you to
start singing, okay?

1670
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,740
People are gonna hear her screaming.

1671
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,003
You need to start singing.

1672
01:13:01,003 --> 01:13:02,420
Fucking sing now!

1673
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:05,267
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

1674
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:08,823
(knife penetrating)

1675
01:13:08,823 --> 01:13:11,740
(Elise vocalizing)

1676
01:13:21,651 --> 01:13:23,863
(coughing)

1677
01:13:23,863 --> 01:13:26,863
(knife penetrating)

1678
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,488
- [Natalie] It's almost over now.

1679
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:41,071
(engine revving)

1680
01:13:45,637 --> 01:13:48,554
(car door opening)

1681
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,543
- [Natalie] It's gonna be okay.

1682
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,283
She did a really good thing for us.

1683
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:00,803
And,

1684
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:04,323
you will start to feel it soon.

1685
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,393
I promise.

1686
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:08,913
- [Elise] If you say so.

1687
01:14:11,765 --> 01:14:14,480
(car door opening)

1688
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,480
- [Natalie] Um, bye.

1689
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:19,851
(car door closing)

1690
01:14:19,851 --> 01:14:22,184
(footsteps)

1691
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,453
- It's never, nothing's
ever gonna the same.

1692
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,323
I'm not the same.

1693
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:51,303
I don't.

1694
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:54,843
I just wish I could.

1695
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,693
I don't.

1696
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,943
Nothing, nothing to do, there's.

1697
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,303
Just have to sit here,

1698
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,243
just like I stood there,

1699
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,803
doing nothing, nothing.

1700
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:14,291
And just.

1701
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:15,124
I just.

1702
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:19,393
Just wanna go back, and I can't.

1703
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,660
I'm such an idiot.

1704
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,308
Why did I just,

1705
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:27,623
just stood there.

1706
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,113
Just let her,

1707
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,633
I just.

1708
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,373
What the fuck?

1709
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,630
I don't know who I am anymore.

1710
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:39,463
I don't.

1711
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,043
It's.

1712
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,753
I can't be me anymore, I.

1713
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,293
Just want.

1714
01:15:55,265 --> 01:15:57,348
(crying)

1715
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,823
I can't believe it's real.

1716
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,130
Nothing's the s--

1717
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,160
Nothing's worth this.

1718
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:12,993
Nothing,

1719
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,967
I didn't know, I didn't.

1720
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,080
I didn't know

1721
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,243
that was gonna be.

1722
01:16:35,413 --> 01:16:36,246
I'm just.

1723
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:40,623
Can't stop seeing it.

1724
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:47,330
And that's it, that's
all it's ever gonna be,

1725
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,990
just seeing it over and over.

1726
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:55,990
And just not moving, not doing anything.

1727
01:16:58,476 --> 01:16:59,963
I can't be me anymore.

1728
01:17:04,736 --> 01:17:07,020
I thought they were the best thing

1729
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,203
that's ever happened.

1730
01:17:10,337 --> 01:17:11,403
It's the worst.

1731
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,203
I can't, I don't, I
don't want this, I don't.

1732
01:17:17,963 --> 01:17:20,880
(doorbell ringing)

1733
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:07,358
(sighing)

1734
01:18:12,682 --> 01:18:14,213
I don't feel.

1735
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,823
Like a person.

1736
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:20,963
I don't.

1737
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,577
Nothing makes sense any--

1738
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:27,923
I just.

1739
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:31,383
I just wish I could.

1740
01:18:34,847 --> 01:18:35,717
I wish I did.

1741
01:18:36,599 --> 01:18:38,836
(door slamming)

1742
01:18:38,836 --> 01:18:43,836
Who the fuck is that?

1743
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:17,087
Fucking kids.

1744
01:19:23,519 --> 01:19:26,186
(door creaking)

1745
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:31,166
(crickets chirping)

1746
01:20:10,627 --> 01:20:13,210
(wind blowing)

1747
01:20:17,873 --> 01:20:20,873
(crickets chirping)

1748
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,964
Fucking kids broke the lock.

1749
01:20:29,964 --> 01:20:32,964
(crickets chirping)

1750
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:06,457
(door closing)

1751
01:21:06,457 --> 01:21:09,457
(crickets chirping)

1752
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:25,681
(footsteps)

1753
01:21:28,269 --> 01:21:31,269
(crickets chirping)

1754
01:21:55,422 --> 01:21:57,755
(footsteps)

1755
01:22:04,281 --> 01:22:06,425
(hard breathing)

1756
01:22:06,425 --> 01:22:07,258
The fuck?

1757
01:22:08,138 --> 01:22:09,388
- [Kyla] Elise.

1758
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:12,515
(thumping)

1759
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:18,852
(Kyla vocalizing)

1760
01:22:33,556 --> 01:22:35,639
(crying)

1761
01:22:37,988 --> 01:22:38,821
- Kyla.

1762
01:22:40,157 --> 01:22:42,153
Kyla, I'm so sorry.

1763
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,060
I didn't mean it, Kyla.

1764
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,853
Please, you know I didn't mean it.

1765
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,333
I love you so much.

1766
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,283
I knew it'd be you that'd
come back, I knew it.

1767
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,740
Kyla, please.

1768
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,553
I'm so sorry.

1769
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,270
It was a mistake.

1770
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:07,950
I knew it was a mistake.

1771
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,661
I shoulda stopped her, I'm so sorry.

1772
01:23:11,661 --> 01:23:13,890
(crying)

1773
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:17,120
You gotta believe me, I love you so much.

1774
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,553
I didn't wanna do it.

1775
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:22,120
(crying)

1776
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:27,030
It was Natalie.

1777
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:29,163
You know it was Natalie.

1778
01:23:31,078 --> 01:23:33,687
I shoulda stopped her.

1779
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,210
No, oh, oh.

1780
01:23:38,309 --> 01:23:40,309
You know it was Natalie.

1781
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:45,435
Please, no (screams).

1782
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:55,250
(deep breathing)

1783
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:59,383
- Okay, so, after collecting
all of my thoughts today,

1784
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:02,510
I really have to say that,

1785
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,630
I'm so fucking proud of myself

1786
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,010
for being able to do
something that I never

1787
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,813
thought that I could do a week ago.

1788
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:13,900
If you told me a week
ago that I was gonna do

1789
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,990
what I did today at that ritual,

1790
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,430
I would have not believed it.

1791
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,460
I really wouldn't have, because

1792
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:21,570
it's almost like all of my doubts

1793
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:24,060
and all of my worries
were just like washed away

1794
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,830
before this all happened at the ritual.

1795
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:28,870
And I feel like that was
Hecate's way of telling me,

1796
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:32,560
you know, I've got you,
everything's gonna be okay.

1797
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,200
I'm gonna help you get through this.

1798
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,200
I want you to succeed.

1799
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,620
And, oh my God, it
just, I already feel it.

1800
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:41,900
Like, I already feel this sort of power

1801
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:45,620
just in my veins, and I feel confident,

1802
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,810
I feel invincible, I
don't feel like myself,

1803
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,680
but in the best way.

1804
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,780
I feel like I could get hit
by a fucking truck right now

1805
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,163
and I'd be fine.

1806
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:57,853
Oh my God, I just,

1807
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,710
I'm proud of myself.

1808
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:01,883
I'm proud of myself.

1809
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,980
So, with that being said,
I think I'm just gonna do

1810
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:10,333
my normal goodnight ritual,
and then I'll call it a night.

1811
01:25:11,457 --> 01:25:14,040
(door closing)

1812
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:18,117
(sighing)

1813
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:21,833
Hello?

1814
01:25:55,226 --> 01:25:57,898
(sighing)

1815
01:25:57,898 --> 01:26:00,110
And it's probably just the cat.

1816
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:03,640
So, now I'm gonna do my goodnight ritual,

1817
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,653
so I will keep you all updated.

1818
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,830
Now I lay me down to rest,

1819
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:12,140
I pray that all the world be blessed.

1820
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,540
Lady Moon and Sister Star,
watch over me from afar.

1821
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,340
Mother Earth is always there

1822
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,600
and keeps me safe within her care.

1823
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,060
The Lord of Dreams will to me bring,

1824
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,660
and when I wake, to greet the day,

1825
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,483
Brother Sun will light my way.

1826
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,713
What the?

1827
01:26:35,051 --> 01:26:36,551
Who ripped out my?

1828
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:43,893
Oh my God.

1829
01:26:50,861 --> 01:26:53,611
(hard breathing)

1830
01:27:05,696 --> 01:27:07,779
(crying)

1831
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:10,857
(thumping)

1832
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:13,690
(papers rattling)

1833
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:18,319
Oh my God, oh my God, Elise.

1834
01:27:19,733 --> 01:27:20,566
Oh my God.

1835
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,023
I have to tell Elise,
I have to tell Elise.

1836
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,730
I tried to call Elise's
house so many times,

1837
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:29,260
and no one is picking up the phone.

1838
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:32,160
And, I'm starting to
get really freaked out,

1839
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,689
and I know, I know that
this isn't possible.

1840
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:36,773
- [Kyla] Natalie.

1841
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:44,117
(gasping)

1842
01:27:47,193 --> 01:27:48,776
- No, no, no no no.

1843
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:51,882
Please, please.

1844
01:27:53,367 --> 01:27:54,936
Please.

1845
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:55,965
Fuck.

1846
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:58,048
(crying)

1847
01:27:59,987 --> 01:28:00,943
No, no no.

1848
01:28:03,848 --> 01:28:04,681
Oh my God.

1849
01:28:05,884 --> 01:28:08,100
(hard breathing)

1850
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:08,950
Protection spell.

1851
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:12,240
Wait, wait, I have a
protection spell in my book.

1852
01:28:16,462 --> 01:28:17,295
What?

1853
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:19,834
What the fuck?

1854
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,979
(crying)

1855
01:28:37,856 --> 01:28:39,054
No.

1856
01:28:39,054 --> 01:28:41,221
(sobbing)

1857
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,217
Kyla?

1858
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:52,372
I'm sorry.

1859
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:00,200
(gasping)

1860
01:29:04,893 --> 01:29:07,893
(voices whispering)

1861
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:29,369
Oh my God.

1862
01:29:31,858 --> 01:29:34,191
(panicking)

1863
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:38,289
(choking)

1864
01:29:42,959 --> 01:29:45,042
(crying)

1865
01:29:46,129 --> 01:29:48,879
(voices echoing)

1866
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,060
- Well, as you can see, I
am free of my constraints.

1867
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:12,540
I have fulfilled my contractual

1868
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:15,170
obligations to be in this chair.

1869
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:18,550
So until next time, that is
if enough of you actually

1870
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:20,853
watch this piece of shit
to warrant a sequel,

1871
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:23,243
I bid you farewell.

1872
01:30:26,592 --> 01:30:28,770
I want my money, and
I want to get the fuck

1873
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:30,231
out of here, posthaste!

1874
01:30:30,231 --> 01:30:32,110
If you think I'm returning
here for a sequel,

1875
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:33,852
you are sorely mistaken!

1876
01:30:33,852 --> 01:30:35,270
I have half a mind to call my attorney

1877
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:36,520
the way I was treated.

1878
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:44,135
(door slamming)

1879
01:30:44,135 --> 01:30:47,385
(soft classical music)
