1
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- What the fuck, man?
- Good morning, asshole.

2
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Not another word.
Hands above the blanket.

3
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Get the fuck up. Hands down.

4
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You sit right there! And shut up!

5
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Police officer! Freeze!

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Shit!

7
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You OK?

8
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- ls he dead?
- Yeah.

9
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He's dead.

10
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l mean, he made a move, right?
l thought he was going for something.

11
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
There's no weapon, man.

12
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Oh, man!

13
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hold it, Dennis. What are you doing,
man? What are you doing?

14
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hey, Dennis,
what are you doing, man?

15
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's up to you.

16
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's happened to all of us, man.

17
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You're not alone.

18
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lnternal Affairs is the most
important division on the force.

19
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We're the cops' cops.
We set the tone.

20
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Therefore, every lAD officer must
avoid even the appearance of evil.

21
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lf cops are better than other people,

22
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
we have to be better than other cops.

23
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Now, Los Angeles consistently has

24
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
the cleanest force in the country.

25
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
That's because of us.
Contrary to popular opinion,

26
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
the officers in the field
don't resent us.

27
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Because we keep the force clean,
they have respect on the street.

28
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Well...

29
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
let's get you started.

30
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yes, ma'am. Was it a two-unit car?

31
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Listen up.
l want you to meet Raymond Avilla.

32
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He'll be joining us as of today.

33
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Detective Peters.

34
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Did you get his name?

35
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
This is Smith, on the phone.

36
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Detective Davies.

37
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Nice to meet you.

38
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
And Sergeant Wallace,

39
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
who'll be your partner
and training officer.

40
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Sergeant Wallace?

41
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Hi, Raymond Avilla.
- Amy Wallace, nice to meet you.

42
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We're fine.

43
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Good.

44
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Can l get you a coffee?
- No, l'm fine.

45
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You wanna run and get me one?

46
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm just kidding. That's your desk.

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You wanna get started?
l got somebody waiting down the hall.

48
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
OK.

49
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's this guy.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He was picked up in the Valley.

51
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He admits having some cocaine on him.

52
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He says the arresting officer
planted a bag in his car

53
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
and beat up on him
and his girlfriend.

54
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Van Stretch.
- Yeah. You know him?

55
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
From the Academy.

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Do you want to pass it on
to another team?

57
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No.

58
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
So, let's go.
lt's right down the hall.

59
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No, we'll drive out to the Valley.

60
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hey, Ramon! You old horse-thief!

61
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Good to see you!

62
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- And you! My old beat sergeant.
- l heard you made it to lAD.

63
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- How's your wife?
- Still busting my chops.

64
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Some things never change. Wallace.

65
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
This man is sharp.
He'll keep you dancing.

66
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We report to Lieutenant Grieb
on the rare occasions we find him in!

67
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Good to have you aboard.
Come and say hello.

68
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Wallace.

69
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
OK, tell him to get here
as soon as he can!

70
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Who you talking to?
- Nobody.

71
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l said, who was that?
- lt wasn't anybody.

72
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Don't hit me, Van.
- Did you call your boyfriend?

73
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l don't have a boyfriend.

74
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Don't have a boyfriend?

75
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Then who the fuck
are you out with all the time?

76
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Leave her alone!
- Get out, Sean!

77
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Let go!

78
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on there, pal?

79
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What's going on?
You're having a lot of fun!

80
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Get him out of here, Dennis!

81
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Let's go for a walk. Look at this.
Look what's going on out here.

82
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Get some air. l'll be right out.

83
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Are you all right?
- l've had it with him, Dennis.

84
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Man, she's on somebody else's root!

85
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l smell it on her, Dennis!

86
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l didn't know
it was gonna be like this!

87
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
That's the way it is.
That's the way it is, isn't it?

88
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How many cops do you know
that have nothing?

89
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Divorced, alcoholic,
kids won't talk to them any more,

90
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
can't get it up.

91
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They sit in their little apartments,
alone, in the dark,

92
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
playing lollipop
with a service revolver.

93
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You get yourself together.
Do you hear me?

94
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You get yourself together
or you're on your own.

95
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
When was the last time
you saw Van Stretch?

96
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Couple of years ago.

97
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hey, could you get somebody to sub
for me at the Galleria on Sunday?

98
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l gotta study
for the sergeant's exams.

99
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No problem. Hey, Fred?

100
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l need you to work Galleria Sunday.

101
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Shit. l can't, l got Raiders tickets.

102
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Trafficante,
you see your kid on Sundays?

103
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Yeah.
- Give them to him.

104
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What Oates said about your
fellow officers respecting you is,

105
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
as you know, complete crap.

106
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Most cops hate our guts,
if they credit us with having any!

107
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They think we went into lAD
for the promotions, which is true.

108
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They're polite
cos they're afraid of us.

109
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Judson, you got messages for me?
- Yeah. You got 18!

110
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l got better things to do
than be your answering service!

111
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah, it must get tense
behind that desk!

112
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Everything's a joke
with you guys, right?

113
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Raymond!

114
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'll be inside.

115
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Holy shit!

116
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hey, Raymond Avilla

117
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Dennis Peck, my partner.

118
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Hillerman case.
- Right. At the Academy.

119
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Very impressive.
- l got lucky.

120
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Hey, it's great to see you.
- Good to see you, Van.

121
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What the hell are you doing here?

122
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He's lAD.

123
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He came to see you, man.

124
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm gonna talk to you soon, OK?

125
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's OK.

126
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He says you forced him
to empty his pockets.

127
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l asked him to and he wouldn't.

128
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- He said, ''Keep your hands off.''
- Why were they on him?

129
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They weren't.

130
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Look, he wouldn't empty his pockets!

131
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What prompted you to search him?

132
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He's a fucking junkie!

133
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's obvious.
He's jumpy, fidgety, talking fast.

134
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Why did you hit him, Van?

135
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l didn't.
- Yes, you did.

136
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
OK, l did.
They made a move for my gun!

137
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They both made a move for your gun?

138
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They say you provoked.

139
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Come on,
you know that's nigger bullshit!

140
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Sorry.

141
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You've had three 181s
for excessive force.

142
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You're wearing a hole in the carpet!

143
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l just stand up to assholes.

144
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We tested the stuff in his pocket
against what you found in the car.

145
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
So? What does that mean? He had
two stashes - to use and to sell.

146
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l mean, if they were different.

147
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Off the record?

148
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lf you need counselling, Van,
the Department will provide it.

149
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lf you have a dependency,
you can deal with it on suspension.

150
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
But if you're caught using...

151
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l don't have a problem!
- Did you hear what l said?

152
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What are you talking about?
Like l said, l don't have a problem.

153
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You look like shit, man.

154
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How's Penny, Van?

155
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
She's great.

156
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Are we finished here?
- Almost.

157
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We'll see you at lAD.
You may bring an attorney.

158
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
All those friends
you have on the force?

159
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You don't have 'em any more.

160
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
May l have your attention
for a minute?

161
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'd like to welcome you
to the New Contemporary Museum.

162
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Andrea Dietrich's work is on view.

163
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hers is the first installation

164
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
in a series
of new contemporary video artists.

165
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
This was made possible by a generous
donation by Nicholas Hollander.

166
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
This is Carlos.

167
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
An erotic artist.

168
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi! How are you?

169
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Excuse me, do l know you?

170
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- You're the girl in the video.
- No, l'm not.

171
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Sorry.
- Nice tie. Your wife buy it?

172
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yes. Nice dress. Where's the rest?

173
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- You're late.
- Let's get out of here.

174
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We've got two more hours. Be good.

175
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hey, tiger! How you doing?

176
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Good.

177
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How did it go?

178
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
OK.

179
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l got a couple more questions
to answer at lAD next week.

180
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah?

181
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How was your buddy Raymond?

182
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
OK. l think they bought it.

183
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's my word against Superfly, right?

184
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l talked to Heather. She said
the guest room's OK, no problem.

185
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Thanks.

186
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Did you have a good day?

187
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l have a racist boss,
a small desk and a new partner.

188
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Do you like him? Your new partner?

189
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's a she.

190
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
ls she pretty?

191
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
She's pretty smart and a good cop.

192
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Let's go to bed.

193
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Did you have to kiss every single
person at the party tonight?

194
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's my job.

195
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's my job.

196
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hey, Heather's trying to sleep.

197
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Heather is not asleep!

198
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How's my boy?

199
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Your little girl is wonderful.
She's terrific.

200
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Did you get your messages?

201
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- No.
- No?

202
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Miriam called. And Kate called twice.
l think she needs a loan.

203
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
And a Steven Arrocas...

204
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Steven Arrocas called
to confirm his meeting with you.

205
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
And Jay called just to say hi.

206
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

207
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi, sugarpuss!

208
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi, sweetheart.

209

- So?
- So?

210
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
So, how was your date, Lolly?

211
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Date? My ex-wife has a date?

212
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- With who?
- l'm not telling you.

215
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi, Raymond.

216
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Hi, Penny.

217
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Good. You look great.
This is my partner, Amy Wallace.

218
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Sean looks terrific.
- He's great.

219
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Big.

220
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Sorry l'm late. And l have another
meeting in two minutes, so...

221
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- This won't take long.
- That looks pretty painful.

222
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What? Oh, this? Yeah.

223
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Van can be a real jerk sometimes
when he's drinking.

224
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- ls that often?
- No.

225
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You noticed any changes
in his behaviour at home?

226
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No.

227
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Having financial problems?
- No.

228
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
ls he under
an unusual amount of stress?

229
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- No, not really.
- No?

230
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No...no.

231
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l see. Using drugs?
- No.

232
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
To your knowledge he's not
using drugs at this time?

233
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No.

234
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Then what's his problem?
We can't help unless we know.

235
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You don't want to help.

236
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You want to nail him
so you can make Lieutenant!

237
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Are you having marital problems?

238
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l don't think that's your business.

239
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Seeing anybody else, Penny?
- Who told you that? Van?

240
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Listen, l have a meeting,
so if there are no more questions...

241
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Not from me.
- No. Thanks a lot.

242
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah.

243
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Very intuitive.

244
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Can l buy you lunch?
- Yeah.

245
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Look at that.

246
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
That's a nice car.

247
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Plus she had the Rolex.

248
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How you doing?

249
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Sweetmeat, don't do this.

250
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Sorry, you can't do it, man.
Can't do it. You got to let her go.

251
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- What?
- She's my snitch.

252
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l need her on the street.
- She made me an offer.

253
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Say it was entrapment,
you did it wrong. OK?

254
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
But l did do it right.

255
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Say you didn't.

256
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Come here.

257
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Dennis, what are you doing, man?

258
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You said you needed money,
l got you a job, right?

259
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You needed time to study,
l got you that. Now l need something.

260
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l can't do that, man.
- All right.

261
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Get out! Go!

262
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
OK? You all right? OK?

263
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You still love me. l know you do.

264
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
She was my snitch, man!
What can l do?

265
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We're fairly sure he beat up
on these people unprovoked.

266
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He has an obvious drug problem,
plus he was rude to me!

267
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Well, nail his ass!

268
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How long will it take?

269
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Two days.

270
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Why don't you give us three?

271
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
All right, good.

272
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Coach?

273
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- You know Dennis Peck?
- Yeah, he's a great cop.

274
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- How come he's just a P2?
- Cos he doesn't care to be a P3.

275
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- He's likes the streets.
- He likes pussy!

276
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Why? Are you curious, Wallace?

277
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l'm curious. Can you set it up?
- Sure.

278
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- How you doing?
- All right.

279
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah. l got to go back out quick.
Want to ask me about Van?

280
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Actually, it's about Van's wife.

281
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- You know Penny?
- Of course l do.

282
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l think that's what the problem is.

283
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah?

284
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm here off the record as a friend.

285
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Do you think
maybe Penny's sleeping around?

286
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You're married too, right? Just
as friends - you're married too?

287
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm married. He's married.

288
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- You're married?
- Yeah.

289
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Does your wife fuck around?

290
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt doesn't feel good, does it?

291
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Stay away from wives.
Don't talk about them.

292
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Do you?

293
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Stay away from wives?
- That's right.

294
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'll tell you about wives,

295
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
my vast, extensive experience
with wives.

296
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They're all looking for strange,
just like you or me.

297
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
My wife, his wife, your wife,
it's all the same.

298
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You're looking for strange.
You see a pretty girl, you look.

299
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Here. A very pretty girl, you look.

300
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Kee, come here a second.

301
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Kee, this is Raymond...Aviller?

302
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- ls that right?
- Close enough.

303
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- She's very pretty?
- She's beautiful.

304
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Do you want her?
- Do l want her?

305
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
ln another life, l want her.

306
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- You won't get another.
- l'm not looking for another.

307
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l'll tell you what.
- What?

308
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You want to ask me any more questions
about Van Stretch,

309
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
do it officially at lnternal Affairs.

310
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l don't need to ask
any more questions.

311
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Good.

312
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l got all my answers.
- Thank you.

313
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You can do better, Kee.

314
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Very clever, Raymond.

315
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Van moonlights 15 hours a week
doing security at the Galleria,

316
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
plus $38,000 from the department,

317
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
plus her $25,000 from the bank.
$85,000 tops.

318
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Last March they bought a house
in Granada Hills for $402,000.

319
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They've spent 300 grand
in 18 months!

320
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What do you think he's doing?

321
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- lt could be a lot of things.
- Think he's doing it alone?

322
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Not Van.

323
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Well, whatever he's doing,
the pay's good.

324
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l can't believe
he's running the show.

325
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Dennis could be.

326
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Which doesn't mean he is.

327
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- We could run a financial.
- We're not authorised.

328
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Ain't nothing
like the real thing, baby!

329
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l got another vice officer
needs work. He's a good man.

330
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l can't use him.
- Can't use him?

331
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You know how much
shoplifters take this place for?

332
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Your cops are all boneheads.

333
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They're in the toilet,
doing flute recitals.

334
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Powdering their noses. Get it!

335
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- That's why you need more.
- More like Lurch?

336
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l don't think so.

337
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You talk to the Arrocases yet?

338
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt'd be nice
if you could help them out, Dennis.

339
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You released her in front of the
station and that was your decision?

340
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yes.

341
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l messed up the initial contact.
l'd have had to perjure myself.

342
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Then, what was the fight about?
- That was a personal thing.

343
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Nothing to do with this?
- No.

344
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Who told you that?
Judson? He's full of shit!

345
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
And you're about
to take the sergeant's exam?

346
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah.

347
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- What are you interested in?
- Homicide, what else?

348
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Nothing else!

349
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- This is my wife, Liz.
- Raymond Avilla, nice to meet you.

350
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- You're gonna be late for work.
- l gotta go.

351
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm no longer here.

352
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Where do work on your second job?
- l work at the Galleria.

353
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Doesn't Van Stretch work there?
- Yeah.

354
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How did you get that?
Every cop in town's after it.

355
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Dennis knows the boss.
He recommended me.

356
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Look, l'm sorry.
This thing just came up.

357
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l don't know, Kath.
l'll be home as soon as l can.

358
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Look, l got to go.

359
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Love you, too. Bye.

360
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
This had better be good!

361
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
At five o'clock, l got a call from
the watch commander at Northridge,

362
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
a guy named Judson.

363
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He said Peck had a beef with a young
vice officer named Dorian Fletcher.

364
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Dennis Peck?

365
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Steven Arrocas?

366
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
My wife, Tova.

367
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Tova.
- How do you do?

368
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Why don't you have a seat?

369
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Would you like a drink?

370
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah. Scotch on the rocks.

371
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'll get the waitress.

372
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
So, how do you know Rudy?

373
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l've known Rudy since l...
How do you know him?

374
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We have contact!

375
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He works for Rudy Mohr, an ex-con.

376
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He got the job through
Rudy Mohr's paid consultant...

377
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Dennis Peck.
- That's very good.

378
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We need to find out how many others
are moonlighting at the Galleria.

379
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:18,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We'd have to go through every single
personnel file in the division.

380
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- So, we're going after Peck?
- Si.

381
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lf we blow this or if we're wrong...

382
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
..we're fucked.
This is your pile. This is my pile.

383
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
My pile's bigger than your pile.

384
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We have a family business.

385
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We manufacture fine floor coverings.
We cover the world.

386
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We're the largest importers
of ceramic tiles in the US.

387
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We import tile from Japan,
France, West Germany, Holland...

388
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Steven.

389
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:23,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l run the business.
l've run it for two years.

390
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
My parents control the stock,
everything.

391
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They started the company.
They came here with nothing.

392
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They were immigrants.

393
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They did many things l could never
have done and l appreciate that.

394
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
But they don't get it.

395
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They won't borrow,
they won't diversify.

396
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They have no idea
how to conduct business today.

397
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We've tried to have them
declared incompetent, but...

398
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
But they'd have to be grossly
mismanaging...and they're not.

399
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They're just not bad enough.

400
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l want you to kill
my mother and father.

401
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What?

402
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Rudy said $15,000.

403
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
$15,000. Well, l could do it
for $15,000. l could do that.

404
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l could get a couple of gang-bangers
to shoot 'em,

405
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
cut their heads off, bury them.

406
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Leave parking tickets
all over the house, names, addresses.

407
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They'd love to talk.

408
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They'll talk about you
and your lovely wife.

409
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What're you saying?

410
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Don't fuck with me! $15,000?

411
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
How much do you want?

412
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'll tell you what'll happen.

413
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You're going to go home
and think about it.

414
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l've thought about it.

415
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Shut up.

416
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
And you will call me
in a couple of days.

417
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Nice to meet you, Steven.

418
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Can l trust you?
- Of course you can trust me.

419
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm a cop.

420
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You go home to your wife.

421
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l still gotta pull some files
on Rudy Mohr.

422
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l can do that.
But just be back by 9.00.

423
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- l got a break on the case.
- Great.

424
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Will you close the door? lt's cold.

425
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lf Peck is handing out extra income
to 40°/° of the division,

426
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
in effect a single officer
can control the division

427
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
by pulling favours.

428
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- lt's bullshit!
- Why?

429
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Speculation!

430
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Then there's his association
with Rudy Mohr, a convicted felon.

431
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
ls it enough for a formal complaint?

432
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No.

433
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Then shut up!

434
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm sorry.

435
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
But he's the most
productive officer on the force!

436
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Do you want a great cop, who,
at the most, bends it a little bit,

437
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
or some straight pistol-ass
who gives diddley,

438
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
which this department is full of?

439
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's not enough
to justify an investigation.

440
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
May we get on with it?

441
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
OK, so?

442
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's clear that you're involved
in a pattern of illegal activity.

443
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Now, we know
you're not acting alone, Van.

444
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
We're prepared to change
our recommendation of termination,

445
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- if you co-operate.
- How?

446
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You've got to identify the others.

447
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You got to help us obtain
the evidence and testify.

448
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
And wear a wire, right?

449
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lf necessary.

450
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Do you want to give us a minute?

451
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Can l talk to you?

452
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You're not authorised
to make this deal!

453
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- lt's a violation!
- Just look at him.

454
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- He wants to talk.
- l am the senior partner.

455
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Your mistakes go on my file!
Retract the offer to Van or l will.

456
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l've got another idea.

457
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Why don't you and Peck pull them out

458
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
and l'll decide which one's bigger?

459
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No deal.

460
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Come on, Van.

461
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Big mistake, Van. Big mistake.

462
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Do you want some sugar?
- l would like a very little bit.

463
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- That much?
- That's perfect.

464
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Raymond offered me a deal.

465
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Uncle Van doesn't have any tea.

466
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Would you like some sugar?

467
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Would you like some tea?

468
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lf l roll over on you, l skate.

469
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You skate?

470
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He doesn't have the authority
to do that.

471
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Don't you understand?
lt's just me. l'm all alone!

472
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Look, l got nothing to lose, OK?

473
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'll put some sugar in hers.

474
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You think l'd wear a wire on you?

475
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Don't you ever threaten me.

476
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
ls that enough?
Oh, yes, l love sugar!

477
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You wanted to see me?

478
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah. Thanks for coming. l thought
we should talk about our problem.

479
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Our problem? We have a problem?

480
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah. l don't know how it happened.
We got started on the wrong foot.

481
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Sometimes l come on a little strong.

482
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No hard feelings?

483
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Got a minute?

484
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Got children?
- No. You?

485
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Eight.
- Eight?

486
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah. Three by the first marriage,
three by the second,

487
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
two by the third,
one from Heather's previous marriage

488
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
and number nine's on the way.

489
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- A lot of child support.
- l love kids.

490
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Do you like 'em?
- Yeah, l like 'em.

491
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah? Don't wait too long to start.

492
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You and your wife OK?

493
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Yeah.
- Good.

494
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Cos these new couples today,

495
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
they get so wound up in their
careers and busy with everything,

496
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
their personal life suffers,
you know?

497
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They still do it, but it's like
they have to schedule it.

498
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You don't hug,
you don't kiss, you don't...

499
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You don't do it nice,
fool around like before.

500
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
lt's such a hurry,
you don't enjoy the pussy any more,

501
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
and your wife isn't getting off
like she used to.

502
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Maybe she's... No, no, there's
nothing going on you can point to,

503
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
but you start wondering.

504
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You're talking about yourself, right?

505
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No. l'm talking about you, Raymond.

506
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Me?
- Yeah.

507
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Not because l see it in you.
l see it in your wife, in Kathleen.

508
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You see it in my wife?

509
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah. ln fact,
l saw her earlier at the museum.

510
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yeah?

511
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- She has long blonde curly hair?
- Yeah.

512
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
She has green eyes.
She had two earrings in her left ear.

513
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Pretty. A bit skinny for me, but
they say skinny ones give good head.

514
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'll tell you what. l'll fuck her
a while, teach her how to come...

515
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Get up!

516
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They said you were a good boxer.
You are.

517
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Not ba...not bad!
- Clean yourself up.

518
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Give my best to Kathleen!

519
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi.

520
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi.

521
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You know how many wives
Dennis Peck has?

522
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Four.

523
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l want to
run complete bank checks on them.

524
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Mortgages, loans, everything!

525
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What do you say?

526
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Please.

527
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
And he opens his bag
and takes out a box.

528
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Remember ''Belle de Jour''? The box?

529
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Well, he opens this box
and he takes out a paintbrush.

530
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- What? A paintbrush?
- No, a number 6 sable brush.

531
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Oh, God!

532
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l tell you,
this guy is a great painter!

533
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi, Raymond.

534
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Hi.

535
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Night-night.
- Get some sleep.

536
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l will. Good night, Raymond.

537
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
So Carlos is a good painter, is he?

538
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Were you listening
to our conversation?

539
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What did May mean by that?

540
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l think she means
that he's not like Peter,

541
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
that he takes his time
and makes her feel good...for once.

542
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Sweetheart, you're a good painter.

543
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
When you paint.

544
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l guess l should buy a sable brush.

545
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Yours is fine.

546
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You just need to dip it.

547
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Hello?
- Penny, it's me, Van.

548
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- How are you?
- l'm all right.

549
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l'm gonna talk to Raymond.

550
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l've got to get
all this stuff off my chest.

551
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
- Are you still there?
- l'm here. All what stuff?

552
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
All the stuff
we've been doing with Dennis.

553
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l mean, l'm on my own now.

554
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
They're gonna throw me off
the force!

555
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Raymond'll cut me a deal.

556
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Don't you think
we should talk about this?

557
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
Penny, can l come home?

558
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No.

559
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
No, Van not now...

560
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l...l got to get up early tomorrow.

561

So, l talked to Chief Healy.

572
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
What did he say?

573
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
The guy knows you're a good cop.

574
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
l told him you're in a programme.
He liked that.

575
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
He's a family guy, too, so...

576
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
the sooner you and Penny

577
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
You'll have to take a suspension...

578
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
But...

579
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:569
he's gonna overrule
any recommendation to terminate.
