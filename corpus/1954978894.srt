1
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:26,652
(ominous music)

2
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,804
JACK (VO):
The mission of the Vegas PD...

3
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,143
is to protect the community
through prevention,

4
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,620
partnership and professional
service.

5
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,286
The acronym "I CARE" is
the guiding principle...

6
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:40,390
for each and every Vegas PD
employee.

7
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,765
This acronym represents the
values...

8
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,304
of the Las Vegas
Police Department:

9
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:49,373
Integrity, Courage,
Accountability...

10
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,240
Respect for People.

11
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,244
The values are supported
by behaviors demonstrated by...

12
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,346
the actions of employees as they
live these values.

13
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,288
All employees are expected to
represent the values...

14
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:08,852
of the Department while in the
workplace and off-duty.

15
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,530
This is Vegas PD's oath.

16
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:23,874
I hate this. I hate my job.
I hate what I've become.

17
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,713
Who are you?

18
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,483
(dramatic music)

19
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,405
ANGELA:
Hi, Jack.

20
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,737
JACK (OS):
Angela.

21
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,401
JACK:
So where's the boss at?

22
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,447
Where do you think? In the
office.

23
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,742
Right. Thanks.

24
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,840
Hey, you coming with to
Red Herring tonight?

25
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,510
Yeah, I'll be there.

26
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,646
Nice. I'll get dressed.

27
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,722
ROY (OS): ...and just make
sure the transfer goes through...

28
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,351
ROY: first thing in the
morning. Go ahead and...

29
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,658
email that confirmation to my
cell.

30
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,197
KIM:
Ok.

31
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,593
Hey! Jack!

32
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,432
JACK (OS):
Roy. What's going on?

33
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,473
ROY (OS): Ah, just making a
killing as usual. Have a seat.

34
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,534
Hi, Jack.

35
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,906
Hey, Kim.

36
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,501
KIM (OS): Are you here
to take me on that date?

37
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,572
Ah, not tonight, darlin'.
Got business with the boss.

38
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,276
Look, we need to talk about
something... in private.

39
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,378
(gunshot)

40
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:51,896
(techno music)

41
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,603
(singing)

42
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,408
ROY: Hey, do you think
it's a good idea...

43
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,774
for you guys to be
drinking together?

44
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,313
JACK: No, but I need to see him though.

45
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,871
Hey hey hey,
my man!

46
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,349
DAMON:
Roy Ridell! Smooth as ever.

47
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,852
Lookin' sharp, man!
Have a seat.

48
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,854
What the fuck is he doing
here?

49
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,391
C'mon, Damon, look. He's only
here to-

50
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,518
- I've been waiting to talk
to you for five years.

51
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,961
Yeah? Well, you know what I've
been doing for five years?

52
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,430
DAMON (OS): Waitin' to settle a score.

53
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,431
Don't start.

54
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,432
Yeah? Don't make me.

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,298
Okay look. Knock it off. Just
be the bigger man...

56
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,997
Both of you.

57
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,263
ANGELA:
Hey stranger.

58
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,501
Angela, lookin' beautiful as
ever.

59
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,702
You too, handsome.

60
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,677
You still playin' for the right
team?

61
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,475
Care to find out?

62
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,249
I can't. It's official - I
belong to Roy now.

63
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,647
Lucky devil.

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,649
[Jack:] Hey, sweetie.

65
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,246
WAITRESS:
Hey, Jack.

66
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,416
[Jack:] Damon?

67
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,823
[Damon:] Vodka.

68
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,588
[Angela:] Cristal, please.

69
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,254
Jack and Coke.

70
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,627
[Roy:] White Russian.

71
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,704
KYUSOVICH:
Wait here.

72
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,769
KYUSOVICH (OS):
You son of a bitch!

73
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,673
Ah! Ladies and gentlemen:
the missing link.

74
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,371
You bring a whole new meaning to
the term...

75
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,708
"killing off the competition. "

76
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,577
[Roy:] What are you talking
about?

77
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,013
Wilkinson.

78
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,345
What, did you guys break up?

79
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,715
Why the fuck did you
kill Wilkinson?!

80
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,381
Whoa whoa whoa, guys, this
is not the time, nor the place.

81
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,388
And who the fuck are
you?

82
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,755
I'm the guy with the gun...
and the right to use it.

83
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,793
Are you threatening to
shoot me?

84
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,657
No, no, no. He's just
trying to remind you...

85
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,718
that all the swearing and
threatening...

86
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,561
in the world won't close a
nine-millimeter hole.

87
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,793
Is this what you wanted to
talk to me about?

88
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,665
JACK (OS): You should have
been a detective yourself.

89
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,728
Now I'll be the first
to admit...

90
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,297
Wilkinson had more enemies than
you.

91
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,309
But you're the only one
in town.

92
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,375
Alright, when was he killed?

93
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,310
KYUSOVICH (OS):
Last night.

94
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:46,912
Last night?

95
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,575
Yes.

96
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,948
Honey, where was I last
night?

97
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,887
You were on a phone call
til about 10, making slow,

98
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,892
passionate love to me til
about midnight...

99
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,588
and then experimenting with
some light S&M until 2.

100
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,790
DAMON (OS):
Ooh. That's my boy.

101
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,390
I've got the hot wax burns to
prove it.

102
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,662
Listen, Kyusovich.

103
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,636
Aren't you tired of trying to
ruin my life by now?

104
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,831
I mean now you're trying to pin
a murder rap on me?

105
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,806
How do I know you didn't do
it yourself?

106
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,444
He was a bastard, but
he was my friend.

107
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,349
And friends don't screw each
other, Roy.

108
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,614
Ooh, imagine that, Jack.

109
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,548
And who the fuck are
you?

110
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,891
I'm his brother.

111
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,993
I don't have to listen to this.
But you hear me now...

112
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,963
- That is not the White
Russian I ordered.

113
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,464
What did you say, mother fucker?

114
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,728
What did you say? (muttering in
Russian)

115
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,099
(punches)
(grunts of pain)

116
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,876
Be careful, Kyusovich...
that could have been you.

117
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,638
DAMON (OS):
Get up.

118
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,751
[Kyusovich:] Let's go.

119
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,762
[Jack:] What the hell was that?

120
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,393
[Roy:] Predicting the weather.

121
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,668
[Jack:] You know, someday Damon
and I...

122
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,536
aren't going to be here
to protect your dumb ass.

123
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,637
Mouth, muscles, and morals.

124
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,806
It's good to have the old gang
back together again.

125
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,878
JACK (VO):
That's the thing about Vegas...

126
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,182
you never really know who you
think you know.

127
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,099
(clears throat)

128
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,167
WHITE: Detective Adamson?
I'm Mason White, LAPD.

129
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,476
JACK:
See anything you like?

130
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,514
I've been assigned the
Wilkinson case.

131
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,883
Why?

132
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,922
It bears some resemblance to a
couple of cases I worked...

133
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,684
a few years ago.

134
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,691
Hm. So you think it's a
serial?

135
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,752
It's a possibility. But, let's
see what you've got first.

136
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,456
MARIA: Hey, Boss? Sorry for
interrupting, but Captain wants

137
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,265
to see you.

138
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,032
Thanks, hon.

139
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,832
Oh, and, she's down at
City Hall.

140
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:29,001
Huh, really? Hm.

141
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,476
CAPTAIN WHORLEY: Adamson, I want
you to work this case with White.

142
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,642
No.

143
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,441
CAPTAIN (OS):
No?

144
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,078
I have to recuse myself.
Conflict of interest.

145
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,816
Sorry, Jack. This is direct from
the Mayor.

146
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,916
Begging your pardon, sir,
but what business

147
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:46,960
is this of yours?

148
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,655
MAYOR GOODMAN: Oh, I understand that
Mr. Ridell is considering a run for the

149
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,164
governor's seat. If he's
involved in a murder,

150
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,927
I need to know about it.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,663
And, Detective...
The fact is, it's my business...

152
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,534
and no one else's business.

153
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,596
Mr. Mayor, I'm best friends
with the man fingers are

154
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,504
starting to point at.

155
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,978
You can handle it. And you can
do it quickly and quietly.

156
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,138
The press is gonna be all
over us.

157
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:12,049
I don't have time for this!
Just show White around town.

158
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,025
WHITE (OS): Is the
forensics report in here?

159
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,189
Yeah, 38. Nothing special
about it. Wilkinson took it in

160
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,165
the head from about
10 feet away.

161
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,965
No fingerprints. No
forced entry.

162
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,076
It says we got the call at
3:40 yesterday afternoon.

163
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,736
That's right.

164
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,835
Why so long?

165
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,940
Well, he lived alone. The maid
didn't show up til around 3:30.

166
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,746
I'm surprised none of his
neighbors heard the shot.

167
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,914
No, three heard it, but
assumed it was outside.

168
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,183
Any theories?

169
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,559
Come on... I know you have
at least one.

170
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,656
Wilkinson had someone over
for drinks.

171
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,599
Later that evening, somebody
breaks in, Wilkinson startles

172
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:06,332
him. Perp takes a shot,
goes for the loot.

173
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:22,348
(music)

174
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,664
Look, this guy had enemies.

175
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,833
Other than your friend Ridell?

176
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,842
What do you know about Roy?

177
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,901
Let's just say "cut-throat
business sensibilities" will

178
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,177
earn you a reputation.

179
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,625
KYUSOVICH: The police... Now
what the fuck is he doing here?

180
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,923
Observing.

181
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,625
He can't be involved.
He's friends with the killer.

182
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,760
No suspects have been named
yet. But Detective Adamson is

183
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,133
the best investigator in Vegas,

184
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,763
So if you want your
friend's murder solved, you'll

185
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,809
do whatever he asks you to.

186
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:21,246
Okay. Come on in, gentlemens.

187
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,324
[White:] What, exactly, was your
relationship with the deceased,

188
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,414
Mr. Kissavich?

189
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,718
It's Kyusovich.

190
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,784
Sure.

191
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,727
Look what Detective White
means is that we're more

192
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,062
concerned in solving a crime
than pronouncing

193
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,966
names correctly.

194
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,228
We've been worked
together for about six years.

195
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,069
What's your business?

196
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,073
Investments.

197
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,905
Care to elaborate?

198
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,037
No. I don't.

199
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,240
Okay.

200
00:11:55,314 --> 00:12:00,343
Then why do you think Mr.
Ridell killed Mr. Wilkinson?

201
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,085
Well, we knew Roy was
involved on his trip to Russia.

202
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,989
There were six of us on the
project.

203
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,995
Roy and his partner had
developed security system for

204
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,861
Russian M.R.I. processing
company or something.

205
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,333
And Roy had to leave
under hurried circumstances.

206
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,097
What does this have to do
with Wilkinson?

207
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,936
Let's just say... Roy wasn't
named there as a suspect either.

208
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,771
You said there were six of
you. Who were the others?

209
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,779
Chaise, Quarrie and Sukay.

210
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,077
Do you think we might be
able to contact them?

211
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,242
I'm sure Chaise and
Quarrie will want to talk to

212
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,946
you. I'll get you their numbers.

213
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,419
Why wouldn't Sukay want to talk
to us?

214
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,480
Go and ask Roy.

215
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,023
Boy, I wish everyone was as
cooperative as you are.

216
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,153
Look, last night you said
Wilkinson had more enemies than

217
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,221
Ridell. Who are they?

218
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,994
Doesn't matter. Roy did it.

219
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,067
Ok.

220
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,764
Are you done here?

221
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,034
Just one more question, Mr.
Kyusovich.

222
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,905
Yes, Detective?

223
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,378
Where were you on the night
of the murder?

224
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,278
Look if you want me to start
working with you, we've got to

225
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,182
start sharing more information.

226
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,378
Agreed.

227
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,479
Let's start with why
you're here.

228
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,223
Look, I'll tell you everything
when we have more time.

229
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,285
But this case is already 36
hours old and getting stale, so

230
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,991
let's just concentrate on that.

231
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,523
Okay. We know Roy was
working with the group.

232
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,135
They didn't get along, and he
has something to hide.

233
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,196
That presents motive.

234
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,300
Maybe. But he also has an alibi.

235
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,936
[White:] Yeah, but so does
Kyusovich.

236
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:37,143
I don't think he did it. I
think someone else is involved.

237
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,414
Well, why don't we go talk
to Roy?

238
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,150
Because Roy is flying to SoCal
on business.

239
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,886
He'll be back tomorrow.

240
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,122
Okay.

241
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,961
I'm telling you, Captain, he's
not the right guy for the case.

242
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,557
And who is?

243
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,500
I don't know.

244
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,969
CAPTAIN (OS):
Yes, you do.

245
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,902
Captain, his bias is the
opposite of mine,

246
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,303
but just as strong.

247
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:05,037
Listen... just keep an eye on
him. Help when necessary.

248
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,342
CAPTAIN (OS): Stay out of the
way when the fit hits the shan.

249
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,179
You can keep your name off the
paperwork. I don't want this in

250
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,878
the news any more than you do.

251
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,444
I'm telling you, this is a
bad idea.

252
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,047
White will bring in the
shooter. You'll just happen to

253
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,525
be along when he does.
Comprende?

254
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:55,353
[KYUSOVICH:] Who's here?
Chaise? Quarrie?

255
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,532
(in Russian)

256
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,564
(music)

257
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,477
ROY:
Ooh! Man.

258
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,609
Eh, it's office...

259
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,348
Hey, so what are you doing
here?

260
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,616
Thought you could use a lift.

261
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,124
[Roy:] Gee, thanks, but Angela's
waiting outside.

262
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,422
Nah. She had a manicure
emergency... asked if

263
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,290
I'd pick you up.

264
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,694
Oh, really. I'm surprised she
didn't ask you for a police

265
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,954
escort to the spa.

266
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,693
What makes you think
she didn't?

267
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:13,167
So what's going on?

268
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,070
Where were you last night?

269
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,971
What?

270
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,478
Roy, I'm on the clock here.
C'mon, man. Where were you?

271
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,174
I was in San Diego.

272
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,113
Do you have witnesses who
can testify to that?

273
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,549
Well, yes, of course. I was
meeting with Tactara and

274
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,210
the Isaac Org.

275
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,448
What did you do?

276
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,389
Well, we had dinner at 7:30.
We had drinks from about

277
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,051
10 til 2. Hey, I've got the bar
tabs to prove it.

278
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:38,325
No... What did you discuss?

279
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,524
Investments.

280
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,729
Alright, look. I'm gonna
need their numbers.

281
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,269
Well, come on, Jack. If you
call them, they're going to

282
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,399
think I'm involved
with something.

283
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,465
[Jack:] Are you?
[Roy:] Am I what?

284
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,602
Involved with something. You
haven't even asked

285
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,738
what's happened.

286
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,581
Ok, what's happened?

287
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,576
Kyusovich died last night.

288
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,119
Was he murdered?

289
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,280
I don't know... was he?

290
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,324
Ah. Okay, Jack, come on.

291
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,156
You basically threaten to
kill the guy, and 24 hours later

292
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,456
he ends up dead?

293
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,123
That automatically makes you
a suspect, Roy. And you haven't

294
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,361
even asked how he died.

295
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,497
How'd he die?

296
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,071
Okay, so you say it was
an accident.

297
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,443
It's within the realm of
possibility, but I really don't

298
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,046
think so.

299
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,379
Well, then someone is setting
me up.

300
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,474
And who do you think that is?

301
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,075
Damon.

302
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:33,618
DAMON:
Roy.

303
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,712
I don't know.

304
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,449
What's going on?

305
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,150
ROY (OS):
Kyusovich bought it.

306
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,456
The White Russian's dead?
Too bad... I really had fun

307
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,294
playing with that guy.

308
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,231
Look, who else would want
Wilkinson and Kyusovich dead?

309
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,167
You haven't met Chaise and
Quarrie yet, have you?

310
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,435
Chaise and Quarrie...
weren't they friends of him? I

311
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,135
mean, they wouldn't try to kill
their own friends, would they?

312
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,644
I could think of a scenario.
You see...

313
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,442
Quarrie always tried to be a
better businessman than me and

314
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,081
he always failed...

315
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,746
So maybe he's trying to be a
better thug than Kyusovich...

316
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,221
And maybe his jealousy
finally got the best of him.

317
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,450
Then why would they set you
up for it?

318
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,458
ROY (OS): See that's just
it... they wouldn't...

319
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,494
'Cause they depend on me.
Besides, if they were

320
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,462
committing murder when I'm not
even in town, then how can you

321
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,498
call that a set up?

322
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,626
Something's not right.

323
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:28,265
Oop. Excuse me for a
minute, gentlemen.

324
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,401
ROY (OS): Hey, does
Angela know I'm a suspect?

325
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,174
No. I haven't told her
anything.

326
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,771
ROY (OS): Good. I had gotten
her way too involved with

327
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,249
those guys before.

328
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,320
Understood.

329
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,281
Who was that?

330
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:46,791
DAMON (OS):
Who?

331
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,454
JACK (OS): That guy you
went back there to talk to.

332
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,290
Just had to make a call.

333
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,195
Yeah, but...

334
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:14,451
Looks like lunch is on me.

335
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,715
ANGELA:
How was your trip?

336
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,485
Oh, it was okay.

337
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,794
Baby, what's wrong?

338
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,194
Kyusovich is dead.

339
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,563
House fire.

340
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,659
Honey, you shouldn't feel bad.

341
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,671
I don't. I'm glad those
bastards are dead.

342
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,832
But I am confused.

343
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,399
I think someone's trying to
set me up.

344
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,603
Who?

345
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,637
I haven't quite figured that
out yet.

346
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,614
[Angela:] Have you given any
more thought to it?

347
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,744
To what, baby?

348
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,219
Oh. Leaving?

349
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,385
Yeah. Let's just go. Let's
move to the islands. We've made

350
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,395
enough. We can start fresh.

351
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,921
Up until this week, we've had
such a great thing going here.

352
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,863
Why would you want to walk away
from that?

353
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,804
You call paying them
$10,000 a month "a great thing?"

354
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,501
Ange, that's a small price to
pay for happiness.

355
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,273
And you and I... we're happy.

356
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,840
Which is a lot more than I
can say for most people.

357
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,515
I don't know. I just have
a bad feeling about this...

358
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,489
Baby, if someone's pulling
strings to get you, whoever it

359
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,293
is probably won't stop until
they've really gotten to you.

360
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:37,735
Don't worry about me. I'll be
fine. Come here.

361
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:49,541
(suspenseful music)

362
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,223
QUARRIE: We know you killed
Wilkinson and Kyusovich.

363
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,586
No, I didn't.

364
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,639
Roy's talking tough, but
I've seen him like this before

365
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,040
it's his way of bluffing.

366
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,406
You will let me know when you've
got something, won't you?

367
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,710
Of course, Captain.

368
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,344
Captain.

369
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,911
Yeah?

370
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,617
Thanks for putting me on this
case.

371
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,856
Don't make me regret it, Jack.

372
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,837
But I am glad you're getting
along with Jack.

373
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,901
Don't remind me of that.
Please.

374
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,809
Come on, Damon, he was just
doing his job.

375
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,407
He didn't have to do anything.
He could have "lost" some

376
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,275
of the evidence.

377
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,650
If he had "lost" some evidence,
he'd be in a cell right next to

378
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,689
you right now.

379
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,720
Yeah. He is a good cop,
isn't he?

380
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,887
He's an honest cop. And you
should be thankful that he got

381
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,055
you out early.

382
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,995
He did?

383
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:51,435
Yeah. Pulled a few strings
with the parole board. But he

384
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,903
promised them that you were done
with the life.

385
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,805
Hey, a man's gotta make a
living.

386
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,105
WHITE (OS): Is Damon
really Roy's brother?

387
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,541
Yeah. Roy's parents adopted
him when they were kids. I sent

388
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,912
him up a few years ago.

389
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,110
Shouldn't he be trying to
kill you instead of them?

390
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,911
Well, Roy and I are best
friends. Been that way for

391
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:14,449
years. As long as I stay that
way, he won't touch me.

392
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,994
What's his connection?

393
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,825
[Jack:] I don't know if there
is one.

394
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,421
[hite:] Hm.

395
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,401
But I'm hesitant to put him
into this... mix.

396
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,138
There's got to be someone else.

397
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:38,112
Hm. So, what are you
thinkin?

398
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:46,056
[Jack:] It's possible. Wouldn't
be the first time.

399
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,956
Alright, assuming a
professional is involved,

400
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,689
everyone's alibis would be
negated.

401
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,993
I mean for all we know, Roy
could have been in Borneo and

402
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,532
paid someone to do it.

403
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,398
Hm. So we check some
bank accounts.

404
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,028
Exactly.

405
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,975
KIM (OS):
Okay, here we go.

406
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,414
Great. Alright, look I need
a list of all transfers,

407
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:15,750
withdrawals and purchases over,
say... say, $5,000.

408
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,449
KIM:
Piece o' cake.

409
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,992
I really appreciate this,
Kimmy.

410
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,551
[Kim:] Remember, I never did
this for you.

411
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,689
[Jack:] Same goes double for
you. I was never here, okay?

412
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:30,759
See? You and I are on the
same wavelength. Isn't it great

413
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,895
how well we communicate?

414
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,871
[Jack:] Kimmy...

415
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,569
(phone rings)

416
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,076
Hey, Jack. What do you got?

417
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,511
JACK (VO): Alright, we've got
a monthly withdrawal marked

418
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,709
"Miscellaneous" for $10,000 a
month every month for the last

419
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,649
three years.

420
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,687
WHITE ( VO): Wow. That's
pretty significant.

421
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,483
JACK (VO): Yeah, well, what's
significant is that there are 3

422
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,148
new ones within the last month.

423
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,659
The first transfer is about
2 weeks prior to Wilkinson's

424
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,025
death. The second one's in
between Wilkinson and

425
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,963
Kyusovich.
And you ready for this?

426
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,227
The most recent was yesterday.

427
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,935
Well, I'd say that's enough
evidence to make him

428
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,234
our prime suspect.

429
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,476
Agreed. Agreed. Look, we
need to get units on Chaise and

430
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,910
Quarrie A.S.A.F.P.

431
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:18,105
Done. Chaise called and
said he had something for us.

432
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,085
I already dispatched units
on both of them - you know,

433
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,145
thought we might get lucky.
Also got a warrant to hack

434
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,123
through Ridell's firewall.

435
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,888
Ha ha. Yeah, good luck
with that.

436
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,826
You've got a better chance
of finding Bin Laden than you do

437
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,024
of hacking into Roy's system.

438
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,932
Look, I'll catch up with
you later.

439
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:43,742
Hey, Jack.

440
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,640
Damon, we need to talk.

441
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,178
Hold up. Hey, Jack, I want
you to meet, uh -

442
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,178
CHARLIE:
Charlie.

443
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,714
Hi, Charlie.

444
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:54,082
[Jack:] Outside. Now.

445
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:58,021
Alright. I'll be back.
Don't go nowhere.

446
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,719
Okay. Look, I did some
digging.

447
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,126
With whom?

448
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:08,895
There's this guy. I don't
know his name. He's a broker.

449
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,699
Ok, look. Let me explain it. The
employer finds the broker.

450
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,138
The brokers hires the
Blue Screen.

451
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,540
The employer and the Blue
Screen never ever meet.

452
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,078
Alright, what the hell's a
Blue Screen?

453
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,977
[Damon:] He's a guy that wipes
your hard drive clean,

454
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,710
so to speak.

455
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,115
They call him the
Blue Screen of Death.

456
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:30,144
That's cute. Look, what else
can you tell me about him?

457
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,190
That's it. That's all I know.

458
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,281
[Jack:] You sure?

459
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:37,159
I swear. C'mon man. Don't
look at me like that.

460
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,094
Look, I'm on your side, Jack.

461
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,895
Thanks.

462
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,675
BLONDE WOMAN:
Get off of me!

463
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,890
JACK (OS):
Get down! Get down!

464
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,725
[OMAN:] Shoot him! What are
you waiting for?

465
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,288
Shoot the motherfucker!

466
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,829
[Jack:] Get down!

467
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,901
[Woman:] What are you
waiting for?

468
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,379
(music swells)

469
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,129
Sit down.

470
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,164
[hite:] Hey.

471
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,265
Hey. You ever heard of the
Blue Screen of Death?

472
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,037
[White:] What, like when your PC
crashes?

473
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,806
Nah. Never mind.

474
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,177
[White:] Alright. I'm on my way
to Chaise's place.

475
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:06,810
Yeah, I'm going to go talk
to Quarrie. I'll meet you there.

476
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,278
SAM: I'm sorry, Mr. Quarrie.
Your membership was based upon

477
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,848
Mr. Kyusovich's sponsorship.
Since his membership has been

478
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,760
revoked, you are no longer
authorized to enter.

479
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:21,095
Sam, it's alright. I'm inviting
him in as my guest tonight.

480
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,863
QUARRIE: Why thank you,
sir. Let me buy a drink.

481
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,838
Much obliged.

482
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:32,002
It's just not fair. I'm a
respectable businessman.

483
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,272
I deserve respect.

484
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,142
I hear you, pal.

485
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,150
My family deserves to
live well. So do I.

486
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:43,450
No foolin'! I didn't know
you were a family man.

487
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:52,858
That's my brat kids...
God bless 'em.

488
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,368
Hey, man, you live very
well. Good lookin' family.

489
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,871
I suppose.

490
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:07,240
Thanks, sweetheart.

491
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,239
What is it you do again?

492
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,308
Life insurance.

493
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,057
That's funny. Someone's
trying to kill me.

494
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,026
No...

495
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,428
Yes! He wants to destroy
everything I've worked for.

496
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,729
He wants revenge.

497
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,735
Why would he want to do that?

498
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,131
You promise not to tell
anyone?

499
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:39,109
Scout's honor.

500
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,178
I've been blackmailing him.

501
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:47,915
JACK (OS): What? Isn't that illegal?
C'mon, what do you have on him?

502
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,822
He murdered someone...

503
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:59,299
No, wait, that was
someone else.

504
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,063
Can't the police protect
you?

505
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:08,368
The police. You know, if
the police were to offer me

506
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:13,540
protre... protection, I wouldn't
take it.

507
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,977
I wouldn't want to
subject my family to that.

508
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:24,823
I don't want them live in fear.
Besides, if this guy

509
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:33,130
can get to Kyusovich,
he can get to me.

510
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:41,937
C'mon, buddy. How bout I take
you home, huh?

511
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,537
Relax, Rookie. We're just gonna
hang back until Adamson

512
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,141
gets here.

513
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,146
So, what's the news, guys?

514
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,282
All's quiet.

515
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:24,982
(music)

516
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,044
JACK (OS):
Oh, c'mon!

517
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,487
(gunshot)

518
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,601
Stop! This is the police!
We'll shoot!

519
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,922
[Jack:] Come on!

520
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,152
Don't give us an excuse,
asshole.

521
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:13,164
This guy ain't giving us any
excuses at all.

522
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,162
ROOKIE: Yeah, well, I... I
wasn't... I never even shot...

523
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,102
Don't worry about it.

524
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,036
[Jack:] Look, we both saw what
happened...

525
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,506
Everything was by the book.

526
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:24,975
[White:] Just fired.

527
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:28,208
Yeah.

528
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,913
What the hell was that?

529
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,609
What was what?

530
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,412
Let's go!

531
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,385
You stay here! Call it in!

532
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,693
[Jack:] Stop the car!
Let me see your hands!

533
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,291
Hands! Let me see em!

534
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:27,100
WHITE (OS):
Hands Up! Let me see em!

535
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,172
I hate my job.

536
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,217
[White:] Sorry.

537
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,125
So this is where you come
to unwind, huh?

538
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,355
JACK (OS):
Yeah.

539
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,196
Nice.

540
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,399
You know we did volunteer
for this.

541
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,165
Yeah.

542
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,639
And we can quit at any time.

543
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,108
Yeah.

544
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:09,204
But there's no one else to
do it.

545
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,114
Yeah.

546
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,019
Look, Jack, about why I'm
here...

547
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,387
I started a file on Ridell
about four years ago.

548
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,653
Two C.E.O.'s he was
competing against met with,

549
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,424
shall we say...
"untimely deaths. "

550
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,364
So what makes you think Roy
was involved?

551
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,230
Those 2 deaths cleared the
way for Ridell's early success.

552
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,407
I can't believe he didn't
tell me about this.

553
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,109
We had to close the case
for political reasons.

554
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:45,909
Really.

555
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,815
I've been watching Ridell
and his associates, just waiting

556
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,613
for them to come back
up on the radar.

557
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,750
Why don't you email me them
case files. I'll look over 'em,

558
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,422
see what I can get out of Roy.
Roy and I owe each other our

559
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,489
lives, but that doesn't put him
above the law.

560
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,702
Wow.

561
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,675
Why are you so hell-bent on
getting Roy?

562
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,777
He's the one that got away
with it.

563
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,144
I always know when they're
guilty, and I hate to see a

564
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,513
guilty man walk free.

565
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,350
KIM (OS): Well, if fate isn't
tickling my tatas tonight!

566
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,358
So you gonna say I can't buy
you that drink now?

567
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,088
JACK (OS):
Have a seat.

568
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,595
GIRLFRIEND:
I don't eat dark Chocolate.

569
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:38,159
[White:] Why? It's rich and
goes down so easy.

570
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,676
[Jack:] Entertain the ladies
for a moment.

571
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,110
[White:] It's gonna take longer
than a moment.

572
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,607
JACK (OS): You know the rules, Saffiote.

573
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,150
SAFFIOTE:
Hey, Jack, we make the rules.

574
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,243
Yeah, well, you're not
supposed to contact me here,

575
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,685
Even if it's a matter of
life and death.

576
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:00,418
With you it's always a
matter of life and death.

577
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,655
We came by to, uh, congratulate
you on such a great job

578
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,427
you did tonight.

579
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,694
What?! A rookie cop kills an
innocent man?

580
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,757
That kid has to live with
that for the rest of his life.

581
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,894
Well it wasn't my idea...
Jack-off.

582
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,736
You son of a...

583
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,672
MARCOSI:
Whoa, Jack. Take it easy.

584
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,731
Get your hand off me.

585
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,435
I don't want to see you guys
here again.

586
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,570
Yeah? Well, do what we
tell you next time.

587
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,815
This is a bad idea.

588
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:32,849
[Jack:] It's more complicated
than it looks.

589
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,563
[Kim:] Oops.
(giggling)

590
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,370
I don't know what to say.

591
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,209
[Jack:] The first thing that
comes to mind.

592
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,509
I don't know if you're a
stalker I should be worried

593
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:04,181
about, or a devoted lover
I should admire.

594
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,783
[Jack:] I'm neither. C'mon.
Have a seat.

595
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,259
WHITE (OS): So what's the
chances these three deaths are

596
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:51,530
one big coincidence?
Okay, not a coincidence.

597
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,597
JACK (OS): Let's go over
the events of last night.

598
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,731
"Blue Screen" figures on us
putting units on these guys, so

599
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:59,607
he knows he has to get one or
both of them immediately.

600
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:16,858
SAFFIOTE (OS):
There's a what?

601
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:17,656
JACK (OS):
There's a guy killing people.

602
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,890
I'm supposed to tell you
about fuckin' killin'?

603
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,364
[Jack:] I'm asking you if
you've heard anything about it.

604
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,401
[Saffiote:] When did you ever
help me out? When?

605
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,299
Tell me one fuckin' time
you ever helped me out.

606
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,497
You know what? Get the
fuck outta here!

607
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,735
See you later!
All set. Here we go.

608
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,869
Anything I should know about?

609
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,377
No. They're not helping.

610
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,936
They've never heard of
Blue Screen?

611
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,676
(phone vibrating)

612
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,548
[Jack:] Adamson...

613
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,555
Make me happy...

614
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,552
You're the man, Jimmy. Thanks.

615
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,524
WHITE (OS):
All three match?

616
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,584
I knew you'd make a good
detective some day.

617
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,857
So you going to tell me
what you were thinking earlier?

618
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,365
JACK (VO): Maybe Chaise
deleted Wilkinson and Kyusovich.

619
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,527
That would explain why there
was no forced entry in

620
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,833
Wilkinson's apartment.
Wilkinson actually invited

621
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,703
Chaise in.

622
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,436
I certainly hope that's the
case. What we don't need is an

623
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,377
assassin running around Vegas
making a name for himself.

624
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,473
Let's say Blue Screen is real.

625
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,848
If we catch him, we could
discourage any other

626
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,944
copycat killers.

627
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,886
JACK (OS): Alright, look. Let's
keep working on the assumption that

628
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,948
there is a Blue Screen, and he
is involved.

629
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,426
So what's our next move?

630
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,329
Find the broker.

631
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,774
WANDERLEI:
(Portugese) Obriga.

632
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:16,143
DAMON:
(Portugese) Obriga.

633
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,940
So this is your infamous
buddy?

634
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:23,147
JACK (OS): Damon, this is Detective
White. White, Damon Ridell.

635
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,753
Nice to meet you, convict.

636
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,017
Take it easy, White.

637
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,492
Way I hear it, you're a
cold-blooded pusher looking for

638
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,688
a reason to get back
in the joint.

639
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,786
What have you been telling him?

640
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:33,831
Nothing!

641
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:37,665
White, take a walk! Meet me
back here in 10.

642
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,872
Look, I need you to talk to me.

643
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,146
Tell you what.

644
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,876
You get in the cage with me
for one round, I'll tell you

645
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,645
everything you need to know.

646
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,652
You're kidding

647
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,412
Time's tickin'.

648
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:50,607
JACK (OS):
Talk!

649
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,735
[Damon:] What?
Tap.

650
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,871
[Jack:] Talk!
[Damon:] Tap!

651
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,074
[Jack:] Talk!

652
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,550
Stubborn bastard.

653
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,919
Wow. Hello.

654
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,961
BRAZILIAN CUTIE:
Hi.

655
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,502
So what the Hell are you
getting yourself into?

656
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,099
Look, you have got to start
trusting me, Jack.

657
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,633
Damon, I can't trust you if
you keep me in the dark.

658
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,839
I'm doing this for Roy, ok?

659
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,076
You're gonna go back to jail
for him?

660
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:35,916
No. But I owe him big time.

661
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,013
By being a murder broker?

662
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,748
[Damon:] That's a pretty
serious accusation.

663
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:45,853
It's not an accusation. It's
just a suspicion.

664
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,831
I haven't even told my
partner yet.

665
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:53,098
(laughs) And what a pleasant
individual he is.

666
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,833
I got a line on a broker,
alright?

667
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,002
I can't confirm he's
involved in this.

668
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,808
DAMON (OS): If you want to check it
out yourself, that's your business.

669
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,975
But he goes by the alias
"El Corredor. "

670
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,281
He owns a rattlesnake
restaurant down in Tijuana.

671
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,050
You should be able to take
it from there.

672
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,589
Okay. Thanks, Damon.

673
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,685
DAMON (OS):
Good fight. Oops, sorry.

674
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,289
[Jack:] It's alright.

675
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,764
[hite:] Hey. You okay?

676
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:28,703
[Jack:] Yeah.

677
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,001
[White:] Whatchu got?

678
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,908
Feel like going to Mexico?

679
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,213
WHITE (OS):
Real classy guy.

680
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,749
[Jack:] Yeah, I bet your
sister'd like him.

681
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:53,925
You know my sister? 'Cause
she probably would like him.

682
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,060
WHITE (OS):
You ready?

683
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,297
JACK (OS):
Ready for what? Oh, come on.

684
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,736
We can't just waltz in there
and tell this guy we're

685
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,899
investigating him for a crime
in another country for which we

686
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,877
have no witnesses or no
evidence.

687
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,881
That makes sense.

688
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,618
Let's just hang back. We'll
check things out later.

689
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:35,038
EL CORREDOR: Bienvenido,
mi amigo. Como estas?

690
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:02,025
You know this guy?

691
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:21,116
Same as before. I already took
my 20%.

692
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:28,018
Look, the employer is
very happy with your work.

693
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:33,191
And you've impressed me.

694
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,009
What?

695
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,949
I think that may be our guy.

696
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,188
WHITE (OS):
Why?

697
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,885
Doesn't he look a little out
of place here?

698
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:07,228
So what are we waiting for? I
mean, why don't we go after him?

699
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,425
Nah, I got his plate when he
came in.

700
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,334
We'll put him through the
system when we get back.

701
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,100
WHITE (OS): Look, your hunches
have been pretty accurate so far.

702
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,266
[hite:] Why don't we have an
unmarked pick him up

703
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,434
at San Ysidro?

704
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,909
Then someone in the
department's gonna know we've

705
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,071
been down here beyond our
jurisdiction.

706
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:26,049
Come on, I thought you were
supposed to be a detective.

707
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,014
[Jack:] Alright, you ready?

708
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,380
Yeah, let's do this.

709
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:44,401
[Jack:] Shh. Alright.

710
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,497
WHITE (OS): You know, for a
detective renowned for playing by the

711
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,476
rules, you sure break
a lot of them.

712
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,808
[Jack:] Look, it's all about
image and perception.

713
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,079
As long as you follow the
rules while everyone's looking,

714
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,916
get the results everybody wants,
you can tweak the

715
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,979
laws here and there.

716
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:09,420
[White:] True that.

717
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,327
[White:] Plus, the best thing
is... the Federales

718
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,296
are easy to bribe.

719
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,991
[Jack:] How would you know that?

720
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,194
[White:] Hey, I could have a
dark and mysterious past.

721
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:22,535
[Jack]: (laughs) No, you
couldn't.

722
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,905
Yeah, you're right.
I couldn't.

723
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,948
[White:] Alright.

724
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:50,494
(menacing music)

725
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,200
[White:] I thought this guy was
supposed to have money.

726
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,940
That's what they say.

727
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,581
[White:] Did you bring a bug?

728
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,277
[Jack:] If we leave behind
evidence we were here, then

729
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,946
we're gonna get thrown off the
case and demoted.

730
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:15,449
WHITE (OS):
Can you crack that thing?

731
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:19,053
Not quickly enough.

732
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,426
[White:] (laughs) Jack.

733
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,602
I'm not seeing anything
else here.

734
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:37,079
WHITE (OS): Yeah. You ready
to blow this pop stand?

735
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,184
[Jack:] Wait a second.

736
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,881
WHITE (OS):
What? What's that?

737
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,049
[Jack:] Looks like a wax seal.

738
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,186
[Jack:] Let's take it with us.

739
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,059
WHITE (OS):
Alright.

740
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,906
[Jack:] Alright.

741
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,375
[hite:] You ready to get back
to the good ol' U.S. of A.?

742
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,469
[Jack:] Yeah. Let's go.

743
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,549
(phone rings)

744
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:20,919
Adamson... Thanks, Jimmy.

745
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:24,727
What?

746
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,163
Standard candle wax. You can
buy it in any arts

747
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,564
and crafts store.

748
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,261
[White:] Wasted night.

749
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,635
Yep.

750
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,363
I need you to tell me about
these guys, Roy.

751
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,494
What do you want to know?
They're dead.

752
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,471
Tell me about your
relationship with them.

753
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,098
ROY (OS): I'm not involved. So
our relationship isn't relevant.

754
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,507
No, it is. The evidence is
starting to mount against you.

755
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,409
Evidence? What evidence?

756
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:16,503
Don't get defensive.

757
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,106
ROY: Well, Jack, you're accusing
me of murder, so I'm gonna get a

758
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,150
little defensive.

759
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,515
Roy, I'm here as a friend.

760
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,554
ROY (OS):
Are you?

761
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,316
Look, just tell me: Did you
see Wilkinson the night

762
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,017
he was killed?

763
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,026
Ok, if I was there, and I
did, you know we have

764
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,392
business together.

765
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,523
I can't believe you lied to me.

766
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,727
Alright, let's take a walk.

767
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,497
ROY (OS): Okay, so what
did Kyusovich tell you?

768
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,004
Don't worry about that, Roy.
Tell me your story.

769
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:46,032
Okay. It started about four
years ago. We were working on

770
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,078
this really intricate way of

771
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,636
[Jack:] Whoa... "We?"
[Roy:] manufacturing...

772
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,410
Yeah. Sukay and me.

773
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,216
But because the market
started to downturn, I couldn't

774
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:58,722
raise the necessary capital
through legitimate channels.

775
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:02,556
And then, I met Kyusovich.
And he was able to raise the

776
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:06,563
funds through... other ways.

777
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,360
They agreed to let us keep
the domestic profits,

778
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:12,028
But they were insistent on
retaining complete rights over

779
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,229
the international revenue.

780
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,171
Ah, well, then they sent us off
to Moscow to adapt our process

781
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,607
for a Russian radiology
network.

782
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,488
Okay, go on.

783
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,650
RUSSIAN WOMAN:
(speaking in Russian)

784
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,181
ROY (VO): I managed to
escape and flee the country.

785
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,451
Why didn't you just go to
the local police?

786
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,459
Well, because during the
attack, one of them kept saying

787
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:13,759
"Kyusovich. " So with the Russian
mob there, I just figured that

788
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,358
the local cops were in their
back pocket.

789
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,300
Alright, well what happened
when you got back to the States?

790
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,804
So in order to get even with
them for killing Sukay, I

791
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,467
modified the code so that it
would only work on

792
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,203
U.S. networks.

793
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:30,213
I got rich, and Kyusovich and
company lost their investment.

794
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,407
And they just let this go?

795
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,712
Hell no.

796
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,116
Because I escaped, I was a
witness to their murder.

797
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,553
And Kyosovich threatened to
tell the Russian mob where I was

798
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,353
unless I paid him hush money.

799
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,360
So that's where the $10,000
a month comes from.

800
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:45,493
How did you know that?

801
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,361
Roy, I'm a Detective. You know
it's my job to find that out.

802
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,332
And that's exactly what you
told Damon before you

803
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,299
Mirandized him.

804
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:55,237
Whoa, take it easy. Roy, I
hate what I do. You know that.

805
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,329
Then why do you do it?

806
00:52:56,406 --> 00:53:01,276
Because I have to.
I have no choice.

807
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,176
Angela wants out.

808
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,307
Out? Out of what?

809
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,443
Everything. Sell the house,
the cars, the businesses.

810
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,147
Run off to the islands, Costa
Rica, wherever.

811
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:11,654
Are you considering it?

812
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:15,456
Yes! I don't know.

813
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:21,432
But hypothetically if we go,
would you come with us?

814
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,298
I mean, Roy, that'd be
great, but...

815
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,634
Jack, it'll be just like
old times.

816
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,234
Roy, I can't. Look, I can't
leave Vegas.

817
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:39,477
Jack. She's not coming back.

818
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:43,986
ROY (VO):
You don't have to wait...

819
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,252
I know.

820
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,523
Let me buy you lunch.

821
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:56,732
[Jack:] Hi.

822
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,433
WAITRESS:
Something to drink?

823
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:58,629
Yeah I'll just have a water.

824
00:53:58,702 --> 00:53:59,863
[Roy:] Iced tea is great.
Thank you.

825
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,905
[Waitress:] Iced Tea.
No problem.

826
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,532
So are you going to let me
take a look at your phone bills?

827
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,805
Why? What are you looking for?

828
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,403
It depends. What are you hiding?

829
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,506
I gotta hit the john.

830
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,609
JACK (OS):
Yeah, good luck.

831
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,791
(phone rings)

832
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,488
WHITE (VO): Talk to him
about Los Angeles, Jack.

833
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:30,392
[Jack:] Thank you.

834
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,870
Hey, so why don't you tell
me about L.A.

835
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,533
What do you mean?

836
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:42,279
ROY (VO): Listen, Jack, the fortunes
of some are often precipitated by

837
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:43,105
the misfortunes of others.

838
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,977
It happens all the time, and
you can't expect me to feel bad

839
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:46,815
about that.

840
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:49,251
JACK (VO): Yeah, well, you know
what? We've been friends for 25 years,

841
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,812
Roy. 25 years. I want to know
why you didn't tell me about

842
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:53,455
any of this.

843
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,449
ROY (VO): Because, Jack. You're such
a freakin honest cop, and I didn't

844
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,495
want you treating me like every
other suspect.

845
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,553
And I didn't want you digging
and finding connections that

846
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,928
weren't there. Listen -

847
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:02,731
JACK (OS):
Roy...

848
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,930
I just didn't want you
judging me, alright?

849
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:10,531
I just... just didn't want us
to lose what we had.

850
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,667
You have to admit, it's
kinda funny how people tend to

851
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:16,338
die when they disagree with you.

852
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:21,907
Thank you... for perfectly
proving my point.

853
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:27,549
Christ, Jack. Who are you?

854
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,026
Jesus.

855
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:36,762
(phone rings)

856
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,366
Yeah.

857
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,563
WHITE (VO): Hey, Jack. Just wanted
to let you know your partner and

858
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,468
the other officers are at
Roy's right now.

859
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,599
Okay. You get the warrant
and I'll bring him in.

860
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,607
Alright.

861
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,438
Leave an unmarked there.

862
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,478
WHITE (VO):
Copy.

863
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:51,738
Shit.

864
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:55,843
Roy! Look, we just raided
your house.

865
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,751
You did what?

866
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,882
Look, we found evidence. They're
getting an arrest warrant.

867
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,823
You're fucking unbelievable.

868
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:08,024
I'm sorry. But now's your
chance, okay? Don't go home.

869
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,067
Turn your cell phone off, get
out of town, and don't tell

870
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,898
anyone except Angela where
you're going.

871
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,369
Yeah, now I can see why
she left.

872
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,997
JACK (OS):
No, you...

873
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:21,906
I'll do what I can.

874
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,846
Yeah? And you'll always put
your work before your

875
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,405
friends, Jack.

876
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,851
That's not fair!

877
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,892
What are the chances your
Sicilian friends are

878
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:39,628
involved in this?

879
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,824
There isn't.

880
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,694
How can you be so sure?

881
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,633
I'm sure.

882
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,002
Anything?

883
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,132
FLATFOOT (VO): Still nothing. The
woman came by about 15 minutes ago. She

884
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,845
only went in for about 5
minutes, then drove off.

885
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,377
Well, did anybody follow her?

886
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,017
FLATFOOT (VO):
Copy.

887
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,416
So where do we look next?

888
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,519
Mr. Ridell.

889
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,962
Detective White. Nice to see
you're still carrying the old

890
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,432
torch for me.

891
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,026
And thank you, friend, for
telling me that you're working

892
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,502
with him.

893
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:20,836
Roy...

894
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,533
I don't know where you're
going with this investigation,

895
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,632
but I am not a criminal.
I'm a respectable

896
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,803
businessman, and as such I am
willing to cooperate with you

897
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,042
gentlemen in any way I can.
Tell me what evidence it is

898
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,516
that you think you have against
me, and I'll try to explain it.

899
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,712
Thank you. I appreciate
that, but you have the right to

900
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,515
remain silent.

901
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:41,490
I know, but silence won't
help me now.

902
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:47,463
We recorded a conversation
between you, Quarrie and Chaise.

903
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,694
I believe you said "Let's
say I don't kill you.

904
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,633
How much is that worth?"
And that sounds like

905
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,605
premeditation to me, which
amounts to Murder 1.

906
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,801
I simply said what I needed
to to get them out of my house.

907
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,572
And let us not forget,
Detective White, that it was

908
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,113
your boy that killed Chaise.

909
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,511
Well, can you explain the cash?

910
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,644
What cash?

911
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,548
He doesn't know about the money.

912
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,955
Angie, what are you
talking about?

913
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:18,051
I've lent Damon some money
to find his feet. I've made a

914
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,789
few withdrawals.

915
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:20,990
How much?

916
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:21,963
50 grand.

917
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,556
ROY (OS):
Oh, Goddamnit.

918
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,498
ANGELA (OS):
He's gonna pay us back.

919
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,900
I know. That's not the point.

920
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,565
I transferred ten grand to him
as well.

921
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,631
Why?

922
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,074
Legal fees.

923
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:36,670
So what, he's playing both
of us for money?

924
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,738
Why would Damon want to
set you up?

925
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,182
He wouldn't. It Judy doesn't
make any sense.

926
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,618
Roy, I don't know what Damon
has planned.

927
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,781
Alright, the safest place for
you and Angela is right here.

928
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,722
Well, you'll forgive me,
Detective Adamson, if I don't

929
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,660
feel safe staying in such a
public place.

930
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:55,699
I think it might be better if
no one knew where we were.

931
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,257
Look, you may be fooling
him, but I'm gonna get you this

932
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,766
time, motherfucker.

933
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,805
Bring it.

934
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,678
Tell me about Damon's jail time.

935
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,986
Well, not much to tell. He did
five years... model prisoner.

936
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,582
I called in a few favors.
Got him out early.

937
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,719
It was all above the table.

938
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:27,059
Did you ever see him in jail?

939
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,759
No, whenever I went there,
he refused to see me.

940
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,232
And you say he got out on
Wednesday, right?

941
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,564
Yeah. What's this about?

942
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,036
Look, I did some digging
and found some video, recorded

943
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:39,565
at Henderson Executive Airport,
on Monday.

944
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,975
Watch this.

945
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,942
Now that plane had no
markings and no flight plan with

946
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,746
the FAA. And he was the only one
who disembarked.

947
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,218
Wait, this doesn't make
any sense.

948
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:53,154
Now the prison records
indicate that he did his time

949
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,056
and was released on Wednesday,
but I checked with his

950
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,118
neighbors on his cell block, and
none of them had ever seen or

951
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:00,629
heard of him.

952
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:03,132
You telling me he didn't do
any jail time?

953
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,658
Looks that way.

954
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,670
You join the stakeout at
Roy's motel.

955
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,731
I'll find Damon... see if
he'll come in voluntarily.

956
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,270
Now you're talking.

957
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,876
WHITE (OS): Now, keep an eye
on the perimeter. Make sure that

958
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:22,851
nobody comes up behind us.
Alright? Good job, Officer.

959
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:36,697
JACK (VO):
Adamson.

960
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,701
Guess whose just pulled
into the motel.

961
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,100
JACK (VO):
Surprise me.

962
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,104
WHITE (OS):
Mr. Quarrie.

963
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,833
JACK (VO):
At the same motel?

964
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,899
Uh huh. And he just checked
into the room right next to our

965
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,605
old friend Mr. Ridell.

966
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,671
JACK (VO): Huh. You mean to tell
me that something's actually going

967
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,944
to be convenient for us?

968
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,350
I'm here to tell you.

969
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,617
JACK (VO): Okay. As soon as I'm
done with dinner, I'll head over.

970
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,989
Okay. See you soon.

971
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,121
No.

972
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,688
You have certain
obligations to us.

973
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:10,995
Don't remind me.

974
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,831
It's our job to remind you.

975
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,734
Why don't you do me a favor
for once, Saffiote?

976
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:15,772
You want me to do you a favor?

977
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,271
JACK (OS):
Yeah.

978
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,069
What is it, Jack?

979
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,733
[Jack:] Tell me about the
Russian mob.

980
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:23,337
The Russian mob? A bunch
of undisciplined drunks.

981
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,642
[Jack:] So you know them.

982
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:27,206
Yeah, I know them. We
had a few dealings with 'em.

983
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,411
Dug a few holes. Sent 'em a
message.

984
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,245
We didn't want to get
you involved.

985
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,414
You didn't want them to
encroach on your territory?

986
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,956
Whoa. You said it, not us.

987
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,258
You don't look too happy.

988
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:41,888
Should I be?

989
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,660
Look, would you hear about
it if they were trying to make

990
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,362
another move here? Maybe try to
tie up some loose ends?

991
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,372
Probably... but I don't
think I'd tell you.

992
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,971
Okay.

993
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,737
SAFFIOTE (OS):
Where you going, Jack?

994
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,071
What's it to you?

995
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,169
Well we have somebody
coming to dinner to join us.

996
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,110
Excuse me?

997
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,706
You know... Kim. We've
seen you together, Jack. You

998
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:05,313
guys make a good couple...
Why don't you give her a shot?

999
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,324
C'mon, you've been alone
too long. Look at this kid

1000
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,122
over here.

1001
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:29,878
Hey.

1002
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:30,278
How's it going?

1003
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,144
Good.

1004
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:33,740
Just brainstorming here...
let's say the Russian mob was

1005
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,751
trying to make another play for
Vegas, they'd want to make a

1006
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:36,485
name for themselves, right?

1007
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,852
Absolutely.

1008
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,014
Well what better way to do
that than to set a few examples

1009
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,785
before they come?

1010
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:43,224
Yeah, but would they kill
their own man?

1011
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,990
Who? Kyusovich? C'mon. He
wasn't the most pleasant guy we

1012
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,258
ever met.

1013
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,266
No, but wouldn't they want
him around for, like,

1014
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,928
introductions around town?

1015
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:55,130
I'm still working on that one.

1016
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:58,470
Anyways, what's going on
here? Where they at?

1017
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:03,742
Ridell is in 6. Quarrie 7.

1018
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,181
I'm gonna go talk to Roy.

1019
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,782
You want me to go with you?

1020
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,377
No, you hang back here. Keep an
eye on things.

1021
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,184
Call me if anyone comes.

1022
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,021
[hite:] You got it.

1023
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:22,957
Baby, it's not worth it. Yeah,
it was paradise when we first

1024
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,432
moved here, but we need to
move on.

1025
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,868
No, we don't need to move on.
I've put in too much time and

1026
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,532
worked too hard to build what we
have here.

1027
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,538
I just want this whole mess
to blow over, so that we can go

1028
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,506
back to the way it was.

1029
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:39,345
(knock on door)

1030
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,405
Who is it?

1031
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,452
JACK (OS):
It's Jack.

1032
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,355
[Roy:] Are you alone?

1033
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,017
JACK (OS):
White's in the car outside.

1034
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,125
It's the Russians.

1035
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:54,494
[Roy:] What?

1036
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,395
[Jack:] What haven't you
told me?

1037
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:56,523
I told you everything.

1038
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,364
[Jack:]Tell me about
the Russians!

1039
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:02,837
Alright.

1040
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,473
JACK (OS):
Start talking.

1041
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:10,911
Alright. Alright, the money
that Kyusovich and the others

1042
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,145
invested in the company was
Russian mob money.

1043
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,449
And?

1044
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,354
So Kyusovich thought he could
regain control of all the

1045
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,019
domestic profits by killing
Sukay and me.

1046
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,392
JACK (OS):
But obviously that backfired.

1047
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,091
We met this guy in Mexico
named El Corredor.

1048
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:32,033
Yeah I know him.

1049
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,266
Of course you do.

1050
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,831
Well then I heard that the
Russians were mad at Kyusovich

1051
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,070
for losing their money,
So I thought if they killed

1052
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,511
him, they could get away
with it. And then in turn, that

1053
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,948
would get me off the hook with
all the blackmail payments.

1054
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,851
So I made a call to the
Russians, gave them some

1055
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,980
convincing evidence that
Kyusovich lost their money

1056
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,389
gambling. And then, I told them
where they could find

1057
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,327
El Corredor.

1058
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:05,326
Roy... So you are -
indirectly - responsible.

1059
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,031
Jack I may have given them
the weapon, but I didn't

1060
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:09,504
pull the trigger.

1061
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:13,567
People have been convicted
for less!

1062
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:17,080
Nothing ever happened, so I
assumed that they let it go.

1063
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,546
But you did set this whole
thing in motion?

1064
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,913
Look, Jack, they tried to
screw me, so I screwed them

1065
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,349
right back. But I didn't kill
anybody.

1066
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:26,253
Okay! You're right. Pulling
the trigger is what counts.

1067
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,086
But we may still have to
charge you with Solicitation or

1068
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:31,423
even Accessory.

1069
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:36,998
Don't worry... I'm sure a good
lawyer could get you out of it.

1070
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:37,599
If it was the Russians.

1071
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,228
Right.

1072
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,498
Well, we need to warn Quarrie.

1073
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,540
That's easy. He's right
next door.

1074
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,475
You've gotta be joking.

1075
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:54,347
[Jack:] You guys stay here.

1076
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:13,268
Mr. Quarrie?

1077
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:20,039
Mr. Quarrie, it's the Police!
Open up!

1078
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:52,168
(music)

1079
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:37,554
QUARRIE (VO): Please forgive me.
They were my friends. I don't know

1080
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:45,689
why I did it. I just can't live
with it any more.

1081
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,164
What? What is it?

1082
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,396
[Jack:] The Russians aren't
coming.

1083
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,814
So Quarrie had Chaise kill his
other two friends so they could

1084
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,611
get all the blackmail money.
He felt guilty and

1085
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,815
killed himself.

1086
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,287
Yes.

1087
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:19,760
So after all this, you didn't
save any lives or

1088
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,264
bring in any collars.

1089
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:23,264
No, ma'am.

1090
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:26,496
CAPTAIN (OS):
Great. Nice work.

1091
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,128
Sorry we let you down, Captain.

1092
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,695
Good thing we're not paying
you commission.

1093
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,139
With your permission, I'd
like to keep the case open...

1094
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,609
see if there really is a
Blue Screen.

1095
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,272
But I need permission to
wiretap El Corredor's office.

1096
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:42,148
You know I can't authorize that.
Do your digging on your turf.

1097
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,153
CAPTAIN (OS):
You two can go now.

1098
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,689
Thank you, ma'am.

1099
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,186
I'll catch up with you in
a minute.

1100
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,319
Okay.

1101
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:59,428
CAPTAIN (OS):
So what's on your mind, Jack?

1102
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,232
It's Detective White, ma'am.

1103
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,101
You're going to tell me how you
hate working with a partner and

1104
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:04,731
No, no, no, he's a fine
partner.

1105
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,333
What's the problem, then?

1106
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,114
He may be the Blue Screen.

1107
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,317
That's a pretty serious
accusation.

1108
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,653
JACK (OS): Look, I know it's a
stretch, but all the pieces fit.

1109
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,522
We don't know who the hell
authorized his transfer from

1110
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:26,687
L.A., but it did all happen
before Wilkinson.

1111
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:27,629
CAPTAIN (VO):
It did?

1112
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,657
JACK (VO): It's the only way
the timing would have worked.

1113
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,298
JACK (VO): And he's the one who
proposed that a professional was

1114
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,395
involved in the first place.

1115
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:39,567
CAPTAIN (VO):
Okay. Go on.

1116
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:41,668
I didn't see him when the
others were killed.

1117
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,474
There are a million people in
the city you didn't see when the

1118
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:47,881
murders took place.
Jack, I can't have you accuse a

1119
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,749
decorated officer... with
connections... of murder based on

1120
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,347
circumstantial evidence.
See if you can find something

1121
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,619
solid, but otherwise don't
mention this to anyone.

1122
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:57,660
JACK (OS):
Okay.

1123
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,853
Don't mention this. Ever.

1124
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:02,888
JACK (OS):
I heard you.

1125
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,335
[Jack:] What are you doing?

1126
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,665
We just got a new case.

1127
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,365
No, we're keeping the
Blue Screen open.

1128
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,634
We have all these notes in
the file, Jack.

1129
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:15,644
Yeah, well that board helps
me think.

1130
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:20,706
Okay. You're still hung up
on Quarrie. I mean, what's up?

1131
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,615
It just doesn't sit well.

1132
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,746
Quarrie copped to it in his
note. It's over, Jack.

1133
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,722
What more do you want?

1134
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,191
Funny you're supposed to be
this great cop that doesn't let

1135
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,488
anyone get away.

1136
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,497
Jack, it's not the biggest
case of my life.

1137
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,466
Let me ask you something, Mason.

1138
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:42,733
How'd you find out
about Wilkinson so quickly?

1139
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:47,470
I told you, Jack. I had
Ridell and his associates put on

1140
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:50,809
a watch list. I'm down here for
Ridell. And frankly, I don't

1141
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,814
want to spend another minute on
this case unless we can

1142
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,940
tie it to Ridell.

1143
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:54,749
Don't make this a vendetta.

1144
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,241
Listen, you're the only one
who wants to prove the

1145
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,480
Blue Screen exists. If you
weren't so hell-bent on making a

1146
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,487
name for yourself...

1147
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,581
Oh, please. Not everyone's
motivated by fame and fortune,

1148
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,718
Mason.

1149
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:06,956
What do you want to do
here, Jack?

1150
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,292
I want to catch the Blue Screen!

1151
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,663
There is no Blue Screen! He
doesn't exist!

1152
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,965
Quarrie ordered it; Chaise
did it. End of story.

1153
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,302
So if that letter were true,
then why would they try to force

1154
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,707
Roy to leave town?
They'd be throwing money away.

1155
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,610
Furthermore, if he really
wanted to kill himself,

1156
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,671
why would he pack his bags and
go to a motel?

1157
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:26,647
Maybe he was confused.

1158
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:30,482
No, he was afraid of
someone, and he ran.

1159
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:31,713
What are you thinking?

1160
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,723
Why did Damon need all that
extra money from Roy and Angela?

1161
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,259
Maybe he was just trying to
scam both of them. I mean he is

1162
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,817
a convict after all.

1163
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,022
I think it's time to put the
fear of God into him.

1164
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,289
Okay, great. Alright, let's go.

1165
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:46,665
No. You stay here. Check in with
I.T. on those account numbers.

1166
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,795
I'll take care of Damon.

1167
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,831
Okay. But if we don't come
up with a Blue Screen, say, by

1168
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:58,609
the end of the week, we move on
to a new case. Agreed?

1169
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,277
Jack?

1170
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,378
(bell rings and crowd cheers)

1171
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,921
So you say you didn't know
that much about El Corredor,

1172
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,489
huh? Looks to me like you two
have been buddies for quite

1173
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:18,556
some time.

1174
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:22,332
Yeah. You're right. We
served together for two years.

1175
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:23,702
Yeah, well, why don't you
tell me about some of the other

1176
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:24,865
guys on your cell block.

1177
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,964
What?

1178
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,442
Tell me about Ramirez.
Tell me about Jones.

1179
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,843
There's nothing to tell.
Ramirez is a gang-banger.

1180
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:34,475
Three-striker. Jones was
falsely convicted. He shouldn't

1181
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,678
even be there, but he won't be
there long.

1182
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,721
There was no one on your
cell block named Ramirez or

1183
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,621
Jones, dumbass. I know you
didn't serve any time with

1184
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,682
El Corredor, 'cause you didn't
serve any time.

1185
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,352
Why don't you just cut the
shit and just tell me the truth,

1186
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:45,927
Damon?

1187
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,727
I can't. You know better than
anybody else that some things

1188
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:49,564
should never be spoken.

1189
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,864
You knew we were gonna find out
about it anyway.

1190
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,835
Only if you play by the
rules, Jack.

1191
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:57,031
Jesus Christ, can't you just see
I'm trying to do my job here?!

1192
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,802
What the hell did you do
with all the extra money from

1193
01:12:58,874 --> 01:12:59,807
Roy and Angela?

1194
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,606
Legal fees. After my legal
fees, I only had enough left

1195
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:03,873
over to get a car.

1196
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,608
You blew $60,000?

1197
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:09,083
10, Jack. Only 10.

1198
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,459
Kim!

1199
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:17,091
Kim?

1200
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,390
JACK (OS):
Kim.

1201
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:18,993
DAMON (OS):
Who's Kim?

1202
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,589
Roy's secretary. Angela
thinks she transferred you

1203
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,689
50,000. Roy thinks he
transferred you 10.

1204
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,860
You only got 10, right?

1205
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,926
Why would she do that?

1206
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,631
JACK (OS):
Maybe to protect Roy.

1207
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,504
She probably got in contact
with El Corredor

1208
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,840
through the Sicilians.

1209
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,085
[Angela:] What are we
waiting for?

1210
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,990
[Roy:] Right...

1211
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:51,992
[Angela:] Roy, you don't
think...

1212
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,997
Yeah, I do think. He's my
brother, but I wouldn't put it

1213
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:59,728
past him. He's got the money and
the motive.

1214
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:03,796
You know you're starting
to sound like Jack.

1215
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,435
[Angela:] What do you hope to
find down here, baby?

1216
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:39,168
I don't know. Answers.

1217
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,972
Why don't you just go
inside and talk to him?

1218
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,842
Okay.

1219
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:49,044
What? Wait, Roy, I wasn't
being serious.

1220
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,173
What, are y'all here to
join me for dinner?

1221
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,074
[Roy:] We gotta talk.

1222
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,772
You boys obviously have
some things to sort out.

1223
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:21,248
I'll be in the seorita's room.

1224
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,247
ROY (OS):
Why are you here?

1225
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,851
Why are you following me?

1226
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,252
What are you doing down here?
You know you're not supposed to

1227
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:30,186
be here. Jesus.

1228
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,657
ANGELA (OS):
Where's the bao?

1229
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:40,635
It's around the
corner, to your right.

1230
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,262
[Angela:] I've thoroughly
enjoyed the rattlesnake.

1231
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:49,243
Although this is probably the
last time I'm going to eat it.

1232
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:55,546
I'd like everything finished
within the next 24 hours.

1233
01:15:55,617 --> 01:16:01,081
Sure, I understand. Thank you
for your loyal patronage.

1234
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:19,700
So what did I miss?

1235
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:23,177
Hey, babe, I think you're
right. I think it's time for us

1236
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,111
to leave Vegas.

1237
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:29,743
What? Oh, baby, I'm so
glad. Let's just leave now.

1238
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:31,684
Thank you for being a pal.

1239
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:35,849
No problem.

1240
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,887
See you at the Herring.

1241
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,892
[Angela:] So what did Damon say?

1242
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:44,229
What the Hell were you
thinking?

1243
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,291
Baby, what's wrong?

1244
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:50,806
Be straight with me! For once
in your life be honest!

1245
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,637
How could you do it?

1246
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,769
Honey, I did it for you.

1247
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,211
Those guys were not gonna
stop... not while they were

1248
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,009
still alive.

1249
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,312
But they got the message.
They got the message after

1250
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:02,351
Wilkinson and after Kyusovich.

1251
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,053
But, Ange, why did you have
to kill Chaise and Quarrie?

1252
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,213
They had families!

1253
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:09,790
Let's just move past this, okay?
They're not in our lives any more.

1254
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:13,351
They can't get to you.
It's just you and me now.

1255
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:19,160
How much were they? What's a
human life go for these days?

1256
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,204
10,000 each.

1257
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:27,766
Then why was it 50, not 40?

1258
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,346
I had to pay for one more
job to get some things

1259
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:34,110
cleaned up.

1260
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,981
You're going to have him
kill Jack!?

1261
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:40,716
What? No! God! Just trust
me... you don't want to know who

1262
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:46,786
the last target is. Baby, let's
just go. Let's sell the house.

1263
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,956
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:54,095
I don't know. I feel like I
don't even know you.

1265
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:59,107
I love you, Roy. I love
you. Can't you see that?

1266
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:04,344
I am going to need some time
with all this.

1267
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:12,416
Okay. Okay, I understand.
How about two weeks?

1268
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,024
And if I'm not ready by then,
what, are you going to

1269
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,255
have me whacked?

1270
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:26,030
Come on, baby. Who's my
howling monkey?

1271
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:33,799
So. What was Damon's connection
was to this whole thing?

1272
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:40,448
He told me how to find El
Corredor. Are you satisfied now?

1273
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,822
Yeah.

1274
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:19,383
Pinche, gringo. You're
developing quite a reputation.

1275
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:27,886
Do you like the "mi
arte de la semana?"

1276
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,959
You gonna sit down? Or is this
an official work visit?

1277
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:37,369
Give me something.

1278
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:43,303
Okay.

1279
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,829
JACK (VO): The mission of the
Vegas PD is to protect the community

1280
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:06,028
through prevention, partnership
and professional service...

1281
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,503
The acronym "I CARE" is the
guiding principle for each and

1282
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:13,269
every Vegas PD employee.
This acronym represents the

1283
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:18,211
values of the Las Vegas Police
Department: Integrity, Courage,

1284
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,547
Accountability, Respect for
People, and Excellence.

1285
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,913
The values are supported by
behaviors demonstrated by the

1286
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:29,048
actions of employees as they
live these values.

1287
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,389
All employees are expected
to represent the values of the

1288
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:35,396
Department while in the
workplace and off-duty.

1289
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:40,094
This is Vegas PD's Oath.

1290
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:51,346
EL CORREDOR (OS): This is the last
job from this particular employer,

1291
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:57,320
but you only have 24 hours.
The employer is

1292
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:04,087
extremely satisfied with your
work, and there's more employers

1293
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:09,499
that are in need of your
services.

1294
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:23,942
EL CORREDOR (OS):
You know this guy?

1295
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:03,546
You know the first animal I
ever killed was a squirrel.

1296
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:06,452
I accidentally ran over it with
my parents' minivan.

1297
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:11,050
I really did try to avoid it.
When I felt it go under the

1298
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:15,587
tires, I slammed on the breaks.
I looked out the rear view

1299
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:21,093
mirror and saw him twitching and
jerking. Much like you are right

1300
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:26,335
now. I stepped out with a
gas can, ready to put it out of

1301
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:30,311
its misery.

1302
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:36,382
But as I got closer, ooh, I
was fascinated.

1303
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:40,513
This creature was trying to
keep its soul from being ripped

1304
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:46,222
from its body. There was so much
emotion going through this thing

1305
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:52,598
because it knew that it would
never live again.

1306
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:58,301
All it wanted was just one
more day, just one minute, to

1307
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:03,072
enjoy its life on this Earth.
And you know what it could

1308
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:09,142
think about? That it's one life
was about to end.

1309
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:15,422
What are you thinking about?

1310
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:28,670
Well, after that, I swore to
God that I would never kill

1311
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:31,036
anything again.

1312
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:39,109
But every day that went by,
ooh, that hunger grew...

1313
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:46,383
The hunger to see that
struggle to live.

1314
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:52,758
You see I don't like what I
have to do... but I am

1315
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:58,632
fascinated by it.

1316
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:04,696
JACK (OS): Lo siento, mi
amigo. ( I am sorry, my friend)

1317
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:10,512
(music)

1318
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,717
(blues)

1319
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,815
[Roy:] Well, well, well, Jack!

1320
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:31,553
Nice of you to join us.

1321
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,390
ROY (OS): Nice to see your
work ethic still supersedes

1322
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,485
your punctuality.

1323
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,622
Sorry I'm late.

1324
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:39,827
So, we're toasting to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of

1325
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,267
happiness.

1326
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:42,463
[Jack:] You mean "Property. "

1327
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,561
[Damon:] What?

1328
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,504
Well, the phrase in the Bill
of Rights actually reads "nor...

1329
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:49,510
shall any person be deprived of
life, liberty, or property. "

1330
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:49,843
(Roy laughs)

1331
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:50,777
JACK (OS):
What?

1332
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,440
Always by the book, Jack, huh?

1333
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:57,282
Always.

1334
01:25:57,352 --> 01:26:03,351
It's nice to see the old
gang together again.

1335
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:24,237
It's nice to see the old
gang together again.

1336
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:28,841
(suspenseful music)
