1
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:00,034
If you could be anywhere in
the world where would you be?

2
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:03,770
Anywhere in the world?

3
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,971
Yes, anywhere.

4
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:12,777
A place where you could sing

5
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,912
and I'll be your manager.

6
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:38,627
Shahnaz Yoonesi.

7
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:40,037
Present.

00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:46,376
Present.

10
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,278
Maryam Hedayat.

11
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:50,647
Present.

12
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,311
Tannaz Hemmati.

13
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:54,081
Present.

14
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,145
Shireen Arshadi.

15
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:57,554
Present.

16
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,287
Tahereh Asghari.

17
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,386
Present.

18
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,488
Fatemeh Shirazi.

19
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,589
Present.

20
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,293
Marziyeh Zarindoost.

21
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:08,392
Present.

23
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,532
Present.

24
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:18,569
Everyone dismissed except
Miss Shireen Arshadi.

25
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,046
Please stay to speak
with the headmaster.

26
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,218
- I'll come with you.
- No.

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,732
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

28
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,465
We have a biology exam today.

29
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,133
I'm her lab partner,
so I'll just wait for her.

30
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:49,869
You've been busy all month.

31
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,074
I can arrange for plenty
of free time...

32
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:56,810
At your service, ma'am.

33
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:02,516
We usually don't let people
like you into our school.

34
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:08,258
Do you know why?

35
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,956
No, ma'am.

36
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,323
Because their character
is questionable.

37
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,734
You're late again
with this semester's tuition.

38
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,968
Sorry, Madam Teacher,
it's my fault.

39
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,998
I borrowed some money
from Shireen, but...

40
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,511
Take it back.

41
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,672
Bring it to my office later.

42
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:29,409
Get to class.

43
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,560
"Your character is questionable."

44
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,453
Cello suites,

45
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,052
Bach.

46
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,063
More specific.

47
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:20,328
The cellist, the key, the movement.

48
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,564
Pablo Casals.

49
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:32,408
Minuet in D Minor.

50
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:37,007
Cello suites, Bach.

51
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,348
Mehran!

52
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,784
The student has beaten his teacher.

53
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,916
The prodigal son.

54
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:52,831
Welcome home.
Are you well?

55
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,926
Mom has made one
of her special cakes.

56
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,493
God help us.

57
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:00,097
Eat it for your mother's sake.

58
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,505
Azar!

59
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,754
How about this one?

60
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,443
Mehran.

61
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,149
Here he is,
as good as new.

62
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,236
You've gotten so thin.

63
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,672
Are you feeling better?

64
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:20,345
Mehran, I ran into Professor Jamshid

65
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,978
at the University yesterday.

66
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:28,017
There might be an opening
in the music department.

67
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,961
Music isn't for me
anymore, Father.

68
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:33,627
What are you saying?

69
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,759
I'm sorry, Father.

70
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,930
Mehran, you've worked so hard...

71
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:25,046
What, are you scared?

72
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,449
I told my uncle that I'd be home.

73
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,579
Come on, I'll make you
a respectable girl yet.

74
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,966
So, what's your name?

75
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,100
Let's see if you earn
the privilege to know my name.

76
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,298
Vanak Square.

77
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:51,742
What's your rush?

78
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,939
We're having fun.

79
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,414
Turn it up!
This song is orgasmic.

80
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,619
Who is it?

81
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:38,055
We're here for the sewing class.

82
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,931
Let me introduce you
to my friend.

83
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,769
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

84
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,640
This is my cousin, Hossein,
who's coming from America.

85
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,643
America.

86
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,407
I'm gonna go dance.

87
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:13,112
Don't worry.
Tonight, I'm your professor.

88
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:24,521
Shireen,

89
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:25,588
Ho-bag.

90
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,098
Ho-bag, Shireen.

91
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,000
Protection's in the drawer.

92
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:33,203
Ho-bag?

93
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,434
Don't worry about it.

94
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,942
I can't hear you.

95
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:40,776
Let's go somewhere we can talk.

96
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,963
Can I ask you a question?

97
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:47,165
Does it make you jealous?

98
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,074
Why would I be jealous?

99
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,101
Isn't he your boyfriend?

100
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,200
Boy, that's how it's done.

101
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:24,608
I knew you weren't such a good girl.

102
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,102
Open your mouth.

103
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,159
Hey, check this out.

104
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,532
Beautiful sparkles.

105
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:45,053
Pour moi?

106
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,718
Pour toi, madame.

107
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,083
This isn't necessary anymore.

108
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:21,284
Dad, I'm not going to fuck up again.

109
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,494
I'm sorry.

110
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,922
This is your weekly allowance.

111
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,289
I need all your receipts.

112
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:05,402
Kids, I have to get to work.

113
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:18,314
Mehran, I have to
tell you something.

114
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,251
You'll die of laughter.

115
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:24,814
Hello.

116
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:31,190
- Mehran, are you OK?
- Leave me be.

117
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,394
Why can't you understand,
I'm better.

118
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,130
I was just...

119
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,365
I know exactly what the fuck
you were trying to do.

120
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:29,744
Can you help a brother?

121
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,451
Could you help a brother?

122
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,525
Here, brother.

123
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,395
Take this food.

124
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,262
My wife made it.

125
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:50,674
If you want help, I know a place
that can help you.

126
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,839
Those addicts won't even
leave the mosque in peace.

127
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,242
The mosque is a place for everyone.

128
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,084
God is compassionate.

129
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:12,158
I'm only here
because of God's mercy.

130
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:22,437
Seeing young believers
like yourself gives one hope.

131
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,141
I'm Mohammad Mehdi.

132
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,011
Your name, sir?

133
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:35,782
Pardon me.
My name is Mehran.

134
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:40,190
So dear Mehran,
what do you do?

135
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:43,354
What's your profession?

136
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:54,268
A true Muslim needs to work
and provide for a family.

137
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:57,742
God has not willed it yet.

138
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,609
Believe in God's plan.
He will provide.

139
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:27,361
Good morning, mother.

140
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,437
Morning, son.

141
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,308
Shireen, put on some clothes.
You have a suitor.

142
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,342
Yusef, please have a seat.

143
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,925
Shireen! Bring the tea.

144
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,778
Yusef, I present
my niece, Shireen.

145
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,041
Did something happen?

146
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,842
It's nothing.

147
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,415
What a heavy surgery.

148
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,847
My back and feet are killing me.

149
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:03,432
I'm not that scary.
Tell me if something is wrong, OK?

150
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:06,164
Mehran...

151
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,469
Tomorrow, we're all
going to the seaside.

152
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,909
Be ready at 7 A.M.

153
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,639
Is that all, Dad?

154
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,271
That's all.

155
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:29,954
Seems like yesterday,
they were children.

156
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,131
Seems like yesterday,
we were young.

157
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:45,660
Little devil.

158
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,100
Dad, let's go swimming.

159
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,940
You're all sweaty.
Go in the water.

160
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:10,284
One day we can all go in
together.

161
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,689
Mommy.

162
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,885
I'm scared.

163
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:34,759
It's nothing.
You're just a bit sick.

164
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:38,592
I love you.

165
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,271
I know.

166
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,909
I want to tell you something.

167
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:56,785
You don't need to,
I already know.

168
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,480
Really?

169
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:05,923
Let's run away to Dubai.

170
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:09,456
You'll sing and
I'll be your manager.

171
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,495
You're delirious.

172
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:17,804
In Dubai,
anything is possible.

173
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,682
It's cold.

174
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,280
Scared?

175
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,958
Dad, pull over.

176
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:30,689
Are you sick?

177
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:33,894
It is time for my prayers.

178
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:36,730
You're joking.

179
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,430
No, it's not a joke.

180
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:50,703
Atafeh and Mr. Hakimi
will be here soon.

181
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:53,176
I'll bring tea.

182
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:00,794
Just wait a second...

183
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:03,357
This system is hopeless.

184
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:05,062
Wait, it will get fixed.

185
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:09,437
1, 2, 3.

186
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,965
I haven't attached the cord
and you're testing.

187
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,171
Can I help?

188
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,139
With the will of God.

189
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,889
I'm grateful.

190
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,158
How I love this song!

191
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:40,118
I know it's a bit late.

192
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:42,524
But I just wanted to say
Happy Birthday.

193
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,858
Thanks.
It was three weeks ago.

194
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,183
One day I'll win it.

195
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,525
The young can dream.

196
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:37,040
Let's go abroad.

197
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:48,219
A place we can be free.

198
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,405
We'll go to clubs.

199
00:41:06,077 --> 00:41:07,567
We'll have fun.

200
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:26,783
Sweet!

201
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:29,156
Do you feel embarrassed?

202
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:31,058
A little.

203
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:49,436
You know what this dork
wants to do here?

204
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:51,935
Tell us.

205
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:54,001
Dub "Milk" into Persian.

206
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:56,673
In the film where Sean Penn is gay?

207
00:43:56,714 --> 00:44:00,650
Milk's non-violent protests
led to a movement.

208
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:03,552
We'd be like Che.

209
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,488
Here they make Che
into a God-fearing man.

210
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,058
But they can't co-opt a gay figure.

211
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,393
Yes, they can.

212
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:15,456
They're experts.

213
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,730
They'll make Milk
lead the anti-gay movement.

214
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:19,997
Exactly.

215
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:23,006
Don't you want to
change your circumstances?

216
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:29,439
President Hossein Obama!

217
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,744
Change has come our way.

218
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:37,882
Hey, don't make fun of Obama.

219
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:40,447
Don't you see?

220
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:43,927
What they were doing to the gays
30 years ago,

221
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:46,589
they're doing to you now.

222
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:50,656
We'll rock the country with this film.

223
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,726
We'll pour into the streets.

224
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,671
We're united together,
we are gay together.

225
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:58,834
We knew you were gay.

226
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,306
Don't worry, Atie.

227
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,577
I'll take the role of Milk.

228
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,608
You play his lover,
Diego Luna.

229
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:10,313
Does that mean I can fuck you?

230
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:13,289
- Yes, please.
- Sweet!

231
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:15,315
This film is not about fucking.

232
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,452
It's about human rights.

233
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:19,520
Fucking is a human's right.

234
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:22,031
I swear it's a human's right.

235
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:24,467
Listen.

236
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,231
We dub "Milk" in the day

237
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,635
for your subversive politics.

238
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:29,639
And "Sex and the City"
for mainstream subversion.

239
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:31,971
Isn't that a porn film?

240
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:35,809
It's always the same with you, Joey.
You're really sick.

241
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:39,475
"Sex and the City"
will sell like crazy.

242
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:41,314
And we'll throw "Milk"
on the same DVD.

243
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:47,184
I want to create serious dialogue.

244
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:52,560
Sweetie, here anything illegal

245
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:55,827
becomes politically subversive.

246
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:58,835
Political acts aren't
that romantic, Atafeh.

247
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:02,100
With the parents that you had,

248
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:04,664
subversion and naughtiness
is in your blood.

249
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,198
Shut up, Joey.

250
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:08,006
I can defend myself.

251
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:11,674
What did I say?

252
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:15,113
What did I say?

253
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,878
Do you mind if I play music?

254
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,215
No, it's a nice song.

255
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,346
Very relaxing.

256
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,386
We can go somewhere relaxing.

257
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:56,723
Excuse me?

258
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,193
Don't be coy.

259
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:01,062
You're mistaken.
What do you take me for?

260
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:02,395
What do you think you are?

261
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:04,230
Sir, please stop the car.

262
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:06,395
Don't think the clothes fool me.

263
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:07,961
Stop. I want to get out.

264
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:11,338
No matter how you dress
yourself, trash is trash.

265
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:17,074
How about we go
to the police station?

266
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,173
I have some friends there.

267
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:27,047
Give me your foot.

268
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:28,814
Excuse me?

269
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,656
I just want your foot.

270
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,025
You think I'm hot?

271
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:32,514
Like it?

272
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:35,614
Feels good?

273
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:50,665
Go to hell.

274
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:34,534
Mehran!

275
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:40,347
We've missed you, man.

276
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:44,787
There is a killer afterparty.

277
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:55,496
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

278
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:58,626
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

279
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:02,069
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

280
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,404
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

281
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,172
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

282
00:51:09,813 --> 00:51:12,441
Shireen! Get down!

283
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:36,665
Oh, my God, are you okay?

284
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:39,005
Hossein, let's dub those scenes.

285
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:49,679
That was awesome.

286
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,712
Fuck the mothers of all the mullahs

287
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:54,747
who shit all over this country.
