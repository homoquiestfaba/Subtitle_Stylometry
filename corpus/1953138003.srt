00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,130
You guys aren't gonna wear that thing tonight, are you?

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,340
- Oh, yes, we are.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,120
Really?

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,910
We're representing our people, the Palestine people!

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,280
We're in Orange County.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,780
So, you think I should wear the black one, he should wear the red...

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,270
No, man, take them off your head.

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,140
They look stupid!

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,620
[ARGUING TOGETHER]

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,360
Alright, look, look, look! Let's settle it how we always settle it.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,910
[SPEAKING ARABIC]
Wrigley's, hummus, baba ghanoush.

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,120
- Take them off!
- Oh, no!

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,740
[CONTINUES ARGUING LOUDLY]

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,020
Maz Jobrani.

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,770
Ahmed Ahmed.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,300
Aron Kader.

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,520
with Dean Obeidallah.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,780
It's the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,130
Hold it!

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,390
What is your name?

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,380
Obeidallah.

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,950
"<i>Obeydala</i>?" What's that mean?

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,210
Uh, peaceful, friendly Arab?

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,940
You don't look like no Arabic. Go ahead.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,000
He's clear!

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,040
From the eastern part of Palestine...

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,030
...Dean Obeidallah.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,800
Thank you guys so much for coming out to the Axis of Evil.

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,810
Let me ask, how many people of Middle Eastern heritage are here tonight?

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,800
Wow!

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,250
It's great to see so many Middle Eastern people coming together in one place...

32
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,630
...voluntarily.

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,080
You know.

34
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,280
We want to thank everyone that's come out to support us.

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,910
There're the Iranians / Persians,

36
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,020
Arabs,

37
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,580
white people,

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,060
FBI, ATF, Homeland Security.

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,490
Homeland Security?

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,390
The cameras are for Comedy Central.

41
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,360
It's a big sting operation. Thanks for being a part of it.

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,470
Now we got ya!

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,840
So I just flew in from New York yesterday for the show. I'm so happy to be here.

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,000
It's the first time, though, I had to go through a new security screening,

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,330
we had to put all your liquid into a little plastic bag, I'm sure you've been through this now.

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,070
Because terrorists allegedly are gonna mix all fluids together on the plane to build a bomb.

47
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,990
Let me ask this.

48
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,950
Don't you think you'll get a little bit suspicious if you're sitting on a plane,

49
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,790
you look next to you, the guy has got ten bottles of different fluids on his tray table.

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,530
He's got googles on, and gloves, and a bunsen burner.

51
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,540
He keeps pouring and closing his eyes.

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,150
He looks at you and, like, "Do you have a lemon juice, or uh..."

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,520
"...turpentine, or something?"

54
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,160
Whenever you hear this plot, you know it's a Middle Eastern. It's gonna make your life more difficult.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,940
That's what I mean, I think more people would rather fly with snakes

56
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,500
on the plane than Middle Eastern people at this point.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,980
But to keep us safe, we've got to think of all the Patriot Act,

58
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,300
everyone's heard of the Patriot Act.

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,250
Remember, we have a thing called freedoms at one point?

60
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,390
Now we got the Patriot Act. You know what's amazing? I've got to say this honestly.

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,730
As someone of Middle Eastern heritage.

62
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,620
It's really important that we catch the terrorists.

63
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,000
As an American, it's also make our life obviously so much more difficult,

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,640
when someone of Middle Eastern does something.

65
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,990
But do you guys know, on the Patriot Act,

66
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,520
any book you take out of any public library,

67
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,680
the government can find out the name of that book.

68
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,850
Do you actually think guys in Al Qaeda...

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,730
...are going to public libraries and taking books out?

70
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,950
And they're going, "OK, we've been planning this for years..."

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,310
"...but we need the book."

72
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,420
"And uh..."

73
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,970
"And we're, like, $30 over budget, OK?"

74
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,600
"It's me, I have an impulse buy, OK?"

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,280
"Omar, will you go to the library and try not to look suspicious?"

76
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,110
And he walks in, "Hello miss Librarian, how are you?"

77
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,480
"I was looking for a book for me and the guys in <i>our club</i>."

78
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,150
"Do you have a book on, how do you say..."

79
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,920
"<i>Waging A Jihad Against The Infidel Dogs</i>. Is there..."

80
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,960
"Is there a Holy War section out here, someplace?"

81
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,700
I think, do you really think our books in the library titles

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,130
that would give guys in Al Qaeda away, like...

83
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,170
'<i>I'm Al Qaeda, you're Al Qaeda</i>'

84
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,510
Or '<i>Chicken Soup for the Terrorist's Soul</i>'...

85
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,060
It scares me the government wants to know what you're reading.

86
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,390
President Bush wants to know what you're reading.

87
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,480
You know why?

88
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,800
He's jealous.

89
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,010
I'm not saying he can't read.

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,340
I'm just saying he probably prefers others reading to him, okay?

91
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,090
He moved up slight, the last few months, in the approval rating.

92
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,080
But as of last week, new poll,

93
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,400
he has fallen back to a 34% approval rating,

94
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,830
statistically, to put it into perspective,

95
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,780
herpes has a higher approval rating right now...

96
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,570
...than President Bush.

97
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,010
E.Coli is gaining on the man, okay?

98
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,570
Spinach is gonna beat him any day, I'm pretty sure.

99
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,250
Now I have problems with him policy-wise, but he is funny at times as a President.

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,510
I mean, he says, I don't know how most people... Most people say Al Qeda or Al Qaeda, right?

101
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,970
Listen to President Bush, I'm not exaggerating.

102
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,270
He now says...

103
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,490
...<i>El Ky-e-duh</i>.

104
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,190
El Ky-e-duh. It has gone from a Middle Eastern terrorist group to a Mexican Restaurant.

105
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,330
It's like, uh, "I've been on the lookout for El Ky-e-duh,"

106
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,010
"their head chef Jose bin Laden..."

107
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,470
"He makes an evil chimichanga."

108
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,530
So, is it, I'm... I'm from Eastern Palestine, also known as New Jersey.

109
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,870
And, uh...

110
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,610
I'm from New Jersey.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,530
I'm a mixed heritage. My father is Palestinian, my mother is Italian.

112
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,730
And for the non-Italian, see, maybe you can relate to being an Italian,

113
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,070
have you at least been at the olive garden.

114
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,130
Did you ever wear tank top to a job interview?

115
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,260
Just my mom, fair enough.

116
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,460
My last name is Obeidallah,

117
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,170
I know many people here can relate to this.

118
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,360
For the non-Middle Eastern people, do you know what's it like...

119
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,170
...being of Arab heritage with a Muslim last name, living in America in the last few years?

120
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,750
I could use a hug.

121
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,200
It is so real, before 9/11 I'm just a white guy, living a typical white guy life...

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,010
...all my friends have names like Monica, and Chandler, and Joey, and Ross.

123
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,030
I go to bed September 10th a white, wake up September 11, I'm an Arab.

124
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,940
And it's weird to be Arab in a different world.

125
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,310
It's a place where people say things to my face about my own heritage...

126
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,960
I think one of the best ways to explain what it's like to be Arab American now

127
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,790
is to share with you some of the comments people said to me about my own heritage to my face...

128
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,090
...I've actually written down in this notebook...

129
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,740
...together with the name and address of each person who said it.

130
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,690
This is the actual, I'm not exaggerating,

131
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,790
this is the actual comments people said when I tell them I'm Arab.

132
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,290
"Oh, you're Arab. Wow, I love hummus."

133
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,190
"Oh, you're Arab. Okay..."

134
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,560
Nothing more.

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,180
"Oh, you're Arab. Ah, that's exotic!"

136
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,400
Yeah, like kiwi, you know.

137
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm sweet, tasty, and a little hairy.

138
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,660
"Oh, you're Arab. Why are your people so angry all the time?"

139
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,820
Caffeine? I don't know what to tell him.

140
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,070
"Oh, you're Arab. But you look so nice!"

141
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,480
This one makes little sense. I've heard this several times.

142
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,880
"Oh, you're Arab. What a coincidence, I love Indian food!"

143
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,680
And a friend of mine said "well, you look pretty white." I understand how I look.

144
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,060
But it's my last name, Obeidallah, that gets attention.

145
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,980
And a friend said "why don't you translate it into English translation?"

146
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,370
Maybe no one will pick up my ethnic heritage during these difficult times.

147
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,300
Let me share with you literally what 'Obeidallah' means, you tell me if it will help.

148
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,030
'Obeidallah' translates into...

149
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,230
'<i>Servant of Allah</i>.'

150
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,440
That's not helping at all, is it, folks?

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,470
Dean Servant of Allah?

152
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,610
How difficult would it be for me to make airline flight reservation for the rest of my entire life?

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
I call American Airlines, "Hi, two tickets to LA."

154
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,040
"Name?"
"Oh, Mr. Servant of Allah."

155
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,590
"OK, hang on. Let me transfer you to card department."

156
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,650
"FBI."

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,870
It's been so difficult at times, honestly, being an Arab heritage in post-9/11 world.

158
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,780
I actually wish that the drug companies in America would've come up with medication

159
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,190
like a Paxil or Zolo just for Arabs in these times.

160
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,890
You turn on TV and "Hello, are you depressed,"

161
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,150
"because no one wants to fly in the same plane as you?"

162
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,780
"Are you anxious because you resemble several people on the government's most-wanted list?"

163
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,480
"Are you angry because every time you go to the airport,"

164
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,160
"you are randomly selected for extra screening?"

165
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,070
"You get randomly selected even when you're just dropping off your friend at the airport?"

166
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,480
"Do you just want to be treated like a white person again?"

167
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,800
"Then you need <i>Arab-be-gone</i>."

168
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,740
"The first medication and especially for Arab-American in a post-9/11 world."

169
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,090
"<i>Arab-be-gone</i> goes right to work, within days your facial and body hair will stop growing."

170
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,050
"That goes for Arab men, and women."

171
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,450
"Within weeks, you no longer use words like <i>habibi</i> or my friend."

172
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,830
"Instead you start using words like pal, chief, and amigo."

173
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,790
"And <i>Arab-be-gone</i> comes in great flavors you love,"

174
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,130
"including hummus, falafel, and lamb."

175
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,700
"Side effects include loss of our identity,"

176
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,290
"pretending to be Puerto Rican, dry mouth, and diarrhea."

177
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,690
After 9/11, honestly I was nostalgic of my childhood.

178
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,580
You know, when I grew up being Arab, it was like, people are curious about you.

179
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,780
I grew up in a place called Lodi, New Jersey.

180
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,600
where there are literally two ethnic groups when I was growing up in Lodi.

181
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,580
Where you're either Italian, or you're my father.

182
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,140
That was the town.

183
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,560
And my dad has an accent, cause he was born in Middle East,

184
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,640
the kids are from Jersey, I'm sure you've seen the Sopranos, they have that accent.

185
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,940
And when they met, the fun would begin. They meet my dad and, like,

186
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,950
"Yo, Mr. Obeidallah, what's goin' on? How you doin'? What's goin' on?"

187
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,060
My dad looks at them,

188
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,790
"I don't know. What is going on?"

189
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,770
"My wife tells me nothing. Dean, what is the thing that's going down?"

190
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,480
"Please, somebody tell me what it is!"

191
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,110
And the Jersey kid looks at me,

192
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,110
"Your dad has such a freakin' weird accent. Where's he from?"

193
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,470
"What, well, he was born in Palestine." He's like,

194
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,480
"Oh, Southern Jersey."

195
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,210
I'm like "No, no, no. The Middle East." He's like,

196
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,080
"Oh, like, Ohio?"

197
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,860
"OK, sure. Why not, Ohio."

198
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,460
And my father is a Muslim, and my mom is a Christian.

199
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,440
And I was raised exposed to both religions.

200
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,800
And my dad would come to church at Christmas and Easter,

201
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,430
be a part of the family. And he took communion one time ever.

202
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,420
And he comes back, I look at him and I go

203
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,400
"What do you think of the communion?" He looks at me and goes

204
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,150
"It needs more salt."

205
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,950
I said "Dad, it's not a snack. It's the body of Christ."

206
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,020
He was "This I understand. Why it does not taste better, I do not get it, okay?"

207
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,070
"You can come with a nacho flavor, or baklava."

208
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,020
"Something fun for everybody, you know."

209
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,570
I think the problem is people are afraid of us because they don't know really who we are."

210
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,620
I mean, honestly,

211
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,710
there are basically two new stories about us.

212
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,730
There... It's no one's fault, but there are.

213
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,540
There's the bad story, where we're described as militant, gunmen, and terrorists, and then..."

214
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,970
"...the occasional positive one, where we're described as..."

215
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,390
"...alleged militant, gunmen, and terrorists."

216
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,380
I'm jealous! We don't get a whole month to celebrate our heritage...

217
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,430
...like other groups in America. Like African American.

218
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,800
Black History month. Asians? Asian Awareness month.

219
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,170
Hispanic Awareness month.

220
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,860
What do we get? Orange Alert.

221
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,460
Not what we want.

222
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,730
And I'll tell you this.

223
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,770
Even the most open-minded people have been pre-conditioned by the media

224
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,650
to be afraid of people with accent.

225
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,790
And I can show you, I can show the same thing with,

226
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,500
or without the Middle Eastern accent.

227
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,860
You can change the whole meaning.

228
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,210
Like, we go "Hey, wait till Friday night."

229
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,910
"We've been planning this for months. People will be talking about this for years!"

230
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,000
It could be a party.

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,860
What if I go, "Wait till Friday night."

232
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,290
"We've been planning this for months."

233
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,310
"People will be talking about this for years!"

234
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,910
Scary, right?

235
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,740
It's scary because sadly you're all racists, okay?

236
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,720
And so,

237
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
our world has changed.

238
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,230
And I'll tell you, I always tell people "I'm not white now anymore."

239
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,950
And they go "Well, you look white." I understand.

240
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,050
But  white to me, in America, is not skin color.

241
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,340
It's status. It's the way you're treated in society.

242
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,320
And let's put it this... My one frank...

243
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,260
And...

244
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,880
But let me put it this way. This difference between us and white peoples.

245
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,760
White people never suffer as a group

246
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,900
when a few people do something bad in their group.

247
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,910
You know, Middle Eastern people do.

248
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,140
And honestly, white people, let's be honest.

249
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,160
You've your fair share of bad things.

250
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,850
Corporate scandals,

251
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,560
presidential assassinations,

252
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,030
NASCAR.

253
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,140
Paris Hilton.

254
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,470
Country music.

255
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,580
That is audio terrorism to me, man.

256
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,820
And then people aren't satisfied enough,

257
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,760
racial profiling of Arabs and Middle Eastern people has gone up, and now...

258
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,980
...have you heard this? They want to do religious profiling...

259
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,850
...of Muslims at the airport.

260
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,060
But it's not in your passport,

261
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,870
so it's now TSA official's gonna throw in a little questions

262
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,580
here and there to figure out your religion.

263
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,780
They'll start out subtly like "Oh, did you pack your own bag?"

264
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,410
"What do you think of pork?"

265
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,070
"If I drew a cartoon of Mohammed, will you be mad?"

266
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,780
"When I say 'Mecca', do you think of a holy place or an urban clothing line?"

267
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,240
Maybe they'll get a huge ham sandwich at the checkpoint,

268
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,270
and if you don't bite it, extra screening!

269
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,870
We're so racially-profiled now,

270
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,960
and I specifically say Arab, because this is an expression.

271
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,340
And I've heard this expression on TV. People used to say now,

272
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,110
Arabs are the new black.

273
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Cause law enforcement is now focus on Arab over black.

274
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,510
I'm gonna be honest. When I heard this expression, Arabs are the new blacks,

275
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,080
I was excited.

276
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,280
I'm like, oh my God, we're cool.

277
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,480
White kids in the suburbs in the OC, and Jersey,

278
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,850
instead of acting black to be cool, start acting Arab with their friends.

279
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,430
Dress in Arab,

280
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,120
wearing, like, traditional Arab headdress,

281
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,050
tilted to the side to be cool.

282
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,380
Open shirt, gold chains, smelling like a lamb.

283
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,240
Walking up to each other, going,

284
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,950
"What up, Mustafa?"

285
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,920
"Where're my Arabs at?"

286
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,820
"Arab, please."

287
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,560
White kids pimping their cars to look like taxi cabs.

288
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,300
But you know what?

289
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,360
Arabs and the blacks make no sense whatsoever. That doesn't mean anything.

290
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,770
You what, sadly, Arab, Middle Eastern people, Muslims in America,

291
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,080
we are the new enemy.

292
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,730
We've replaced the Soviet Union.

293
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,460
And we are stuck here...

294
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,620
...til somebody replaces us.

295
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,450
That's why I'm begging all of you to help me taunt North Korea as much as possible.

296
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,740
It won't take much.

297
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,900
Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, is crazy. He wants attention.

298
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,300
He's like the middle child of this Axis of Evil, this guy.

299
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,040
Have you seen him, with the big glasses and the hair,

300
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,830
looks like a James Bond villain, you know.

301
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,660
petting cats, and stuff.

302
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,620
And I got an idea to get Bush interested.

303
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,890
We tell Bush...

304
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,710
K...im Jong Il has got tons of oil...

305
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,040
...in his hair.

306
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,920
So...

307
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,620
But before I go, I can only hope that, I mean, we all hope people understand us more.

308
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,900
I also hope, selfishly, for peace in the Middle East.

309
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,300
I have lot of uncles and cousins who live in the West Bank.

310
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,000
Um, I'm sure other people have family there, or they're tied to the region by religion.

311
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,220
And I so believe that if Ehud Olmert, the prime minster of Israel,

312
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,800
and Abu Mazen, the president of the Palestinian people, made peace,

313
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,180
one, they get the Nobel Peace prize, that's a given.

314
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,910
I also think...

315
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,300
...they would get commercial endorsements worldwide as a result.

316
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,060
Hear me out.

317
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,250
One day you turn on the TV, it's like, "Hello, I am Ehud Olmert."

318
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,460
"And I am Abu Mazen."

319
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,530
"For over 50 years, our people have fought each other tooth and nail."

320
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,050
"In fact, we hated each other very much."

321
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,340
"But through it all, we've always agreed on one thing."

322
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,360
"The great taste of <i>Miller Lite</i>."

323
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,090
"Let's drink! Taste great! Let's drink! Taste great!"

324
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,440
"Ah, now we fight only about beer."

325
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,850
You guys, thank you very much, God bless you, thank you so much for coming out.

326
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,000
Come up, sir.

327
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,540
Ooh! Wait, you're supposed to take off your jacket.

328
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,690
But I'll do a body search for you, ooh.

329
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,770
Yeah, Middle Eastern George Clooney.

330
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,180
This is uncomfortable.

331
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,350
Is this, uh, that's not necessary, is it?

332
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,490
Yes it is, honey. Go on through.

333
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,750
He's clear.

334
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,850
From the Heartland,

335
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,880
Ahmed Ahmed.

336
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,650
Hey, what's up?

337
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,920
Well, thanks for coming out to the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.

338
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,380
My name is Ahmed Ahmed.  We have Dean Obeidallah who is Palestinian.

339
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,330
Aron Kader is Palestinian.  Maz Jobrani is Iranian.

340
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,530
We're still looking for a North Korean, so if you know any, we're auditioning tomorrow afternoon.

341
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:49,380
Next year we're going to do the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour, Musical On Ice!  So look out for that!

342
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,340
I heard Dean earlier ask how many Middle Eastern people were here.  How many white people

343
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,380
are here tonight?  White people?

344
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,960
Welcome to our meeting.

345
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,460
This is going to be fun, fun, fun.

346
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,330
I got to say, its a bad time to be from the Middle East.  In fact, I read a statistic on CBS.com

347
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,650
that said right after 9-11, hate crimes against Arabs and Middle Eastern people and Muslims

348
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,330
went up over 1000 percent. Yeah.

349
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,590
Which apparently still put us in fourth place behind blacks, gays, and Jews.

350
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,330
Did you guys know this? We're still in fourth place.

351
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,250
So what do we have to do?

352
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,440
I mean, we can't even win in hatred!

353
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,450
I want to be number one in something!

354
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,230
It's such a bad time. I've gotta fly to London at the end of the month and I hate flying

355
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,170
because my name is on like nine lists.

356
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,110
I googled my name and it matches the name of a guy in the Middle East who's a terrorist.

357
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,680
I think he's in the Middle East googling me going, "There's this guy in America, man."

358
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,170
People go up to him, "Hey man, you're so funny.  Tell me a joke!"

359
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,410
"I'm not a comedian! I'm a terrorist! Want me to prove it to you?"

360
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,400
"I'll blow myself up right now, I swear!"

361
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,350
I hate flying though because I always have to go through the TSA.

362
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,420
They always stop me and go, "Mr. Ahmed, we're going to have to pat down your midsection."

363
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,420
So, I always look at them and go, "Um, promise?"

364
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,380
Whenever I get on a plane, I always know who the Air Marshall is.

365
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,330
Yeah, it's always the guy sitting there holding the People Magazine upside down, looking right at me.

366
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,380
I went to hotwire.com to order a ticket online. Anybody ever use hotwire.com?

367
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:01,210
That's a shady website - they make you purchase your ticket first, then they tell you what airline

368
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,240
you're flying out on, and what time you fly out.  So, I purchased a ticket and it turns out

369
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,690
I had to fly out at like 4:30 in the morning on like Zimbabwe Air, stop over in Bangladesh,

370
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,840
and sit next to farm animals.  And they ask you all these questions on the website

371
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,970
like, are you prepared to swim? Cause I've got...

372
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,870
Can you operate a parachute?

373
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,060
This conversation never happened.

374
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,370
I went online to order a ticket on Southwest Airlines - anybody ever go to Southwest Airlines?

375
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,030
They are cheap, man! They're so cheap when I got on the plane, the pilot asked me for gas money!

376
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,910
That's how cheap they are! All right? The only reason I fly Southwest is 'cuz they don't check

377
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,350
Middle Eastern people. Try it.

378
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,450
Every time I fly Southwest, "Mr. Ahmed, you're Arab and you're Muslim, huh?"

379
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,270
"Ah, go ahead, we'll probably crash before you do anything - go ahead."

380
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,290
I watch a lot of the news, man. I love watching the Middle Eastern people on the news talk

381
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,630
about what's going on in the Middle East,

382
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,300
'cause all Middle Eastern people always start each sentence with,

383
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:14,850
"ehhhh - ehhhh the damn United States of America, they come into our country"

384
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,380
"and they bomb our, ehhhhhh -"

385
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,110
Just finish the sentence, Mostafa!

386
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,490
I got to go to Dubai, I did comedy in Dubai

387
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,930
and that's a Muslim city and anybody ever been to Dubai?

388
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,680
Hear of Dubai? Have you?

389
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,090
How cool is that place?  It's a little decadent for me, a little opulent for me.

390
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,480
The guy, Emir, the guy who runs the whole city,

391
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,410
he has the only seven star hotel in the whole wide world - in Dubai.

392
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:53,640
When critics ask who gave it seven stars, he's like, "ehhhh, I gave it seven stars, ehhhh."

393
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,350
It's a schizophrenic place 'cuz you'll walk down to the beach and see a Muslim woman wearing

394
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,390
hijab then you'll see European men in Speedos.

395
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,930
You'll see a mosque and right across the street from the mosque - there's a night club!

396
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,570
So right around 8 o'clock every night all you hear is:

397
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:21,950
[Making sound of call to prayer and club beat]

398
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,640
"Ehhh, I don't know, I'm so confused."

399
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,420
"Should I go pray or should I go dance? Not quite sure!"

400
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,350
"Please God, help me with your Arabic accent! Please."

401
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,760
Muslims will come up to me and go, "Ahmed - ehhh, I don't like it when you joke about Islam."

402
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,730
"OK? That is haram. That is against God."

403
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:56,570
"Yeah, I'll take a Heineken. Like I was saying -"

404
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,390
Just hypocrites!

405
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,850
I asked the audience when I went to Dubai, I said, "how many Muslims are here?" They were like,

406
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,430
"Walalalalalal!"

407
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,510
I go, "how many of you are practicing?" They were like,

408
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,310
It's like you know you are a Muslim when you drink, gamble, have sex - but you won't eat pork!

409
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,530
That's the weirdest thing, you won't eat pork.

410
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,750
See, I live in Los Angeles, California. There aren't any Muslims in Los Angeles, California.

411
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,560
A lot of Jews! Any Jews here?

412
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:43,660
Shhhh!  Shhhh!  Shhhh!

413
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,340
The producers are Jews - you're gonna get me fired!

414
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,370
All my friends are like, "Hey man how do you have so many Jewish friend? What about the Jews"

415
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,350
"and the Muslims and the war and hate and all that - tell me about that, huh?"

416
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,060
I'm like, look when you think about, both Jews and Muslims have more in common than any

417
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,540
other religion ever. Both Jews and Muslims don't eat pork, we don't celebrate Christmas,

418
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,110
we both use:  [making sound of "helch"] in our pronunciation.

419
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,050
We both yell on the phone when there's no emergency.

420
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,050
The only difference between Muslims and Jews is that Jews never like to spend any money

421
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,110
and Muslims never have any money to spend. That's the only difference between the

422
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,620
Muslims and the Jews! That's what I'm trying to tell you!

423
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,120
I love living in Hollywood 'cuz I've been blessed to work with great people and I stopped

424
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,420
doing acting a long time ago and I got into comedy because in the acting world,

425
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,750
they always stereo-type you, like I was always cast to play the terrorist - imagine that!

426
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,080
I was in a movie a while back where I played a terrorist and the movie was about a bunch of

427
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,400
terrorists who hijack an airplane - imagine that!

428
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,310
My agent called me and said, "well, you should go in and read for this part."  I said, "what's the part?"

429
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,190
and she said, 'Terrorist number 4.'

430
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,410
Because number 1, 2, and 3 went to a black guy, a gay guy, and a Jew.

431
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,410
Number 4!

432
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,780
I didn't even want to go into the role, my agent said, go in and read for this part!

433
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,180
I said, all right, I'll just go in and meet the director.

434
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,680
So I go in and meet the director, the casting director,

435
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,430
I read my lines over the top because I just wanted to have fun with it.

436
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,250
The director went nuts!  He was like, "OK do it one more time."

437
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,260
"SIT DOWN! YOU WILL OBEY! OR I WILL KILL YOU IN THE NAME OF ALLAH!"

438
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,940
He sat there and was like -

439
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,430
"That's exactly what we are looking for!"

440
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,390
"I want to see you do it again,"

441
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,580
"but this time give me a little bit more of that Middle Eastern, mmerrroww!"

442
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,420
"You know how your people are, very - mmerroww!"

443
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,600
So I was like, "Angry?"

444
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,720
"Yes, exactly! Use that hidden Middle Eastern anger that your people possess!"

445
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,610
So I used my hidden Middle Eastern anger that my people possess - ha-ha!

446
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,880
And I got the part! My agent called me the next day and said, "they want to put you in this movie!"

447
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,140
I was like, "I wasn't even trying for the role! I was making fun of it!"

448
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,340
She said, "whatever you did, it worked. They want to put you in this film."

449
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,880
I said, "look, tell them I said thanks but no thanks. Every time I take part like this, it's like"

450
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,920
"feeding the beast, its like putting fuel on the flame, no way."

451
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,820
Thank you.

452
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,940
And then she said, "They want to pay you $30,000 for a week at work."

453
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,950
So I was like -

454
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,930
[Whoooo!]

455
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,270
Ehhhhhh!

456
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,000
[Walalalalalal!]

457
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,350
[Machine gun sounds]

458
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,940
Burn it all down!

459
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,850
So now we're doing the comedy - making fun of what's going on in the Middle East.

460
00:27:59,850 --> 00:27:59,870
We have to - we have to laugh at ourselves, I think, right people? We have to laugh at ourselves.
So now we're doing the comedy - making fun of what's going on in the Middle East.

461
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,980
We have to - we have to laugh at ourselves, I think, right people? We have to laugh at ourselves.

462
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm watching the news, too, and it's like kind of messed up because they're showing like all these

463
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,870
terrorist groups. OK there's like several organizations out there - Islamic Jihad,

464
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,940
people think Hezbollah, Hamas, Al Qaeda...

465
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,850
there's so many, how do you know which one is the best one to join?

466
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,700
Like if you choose to join a terrorist organization,

467
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,100
how do you know which one is the best one to join?

468
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,620
Is it like rushing a fraternity?

469
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,400
I think they have recruiters. These guys sitting outside of the mosque going up

470
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,400
to these little Muslim boys, "come here, habibi, come here. I want to talk to you, come here."

471
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,700
"Don't go to Al Qaeda, they are shit."

472
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,370
"Come to the Islamic brotherhood. Why you ask? Well, they only promise you 72 virgin."

473
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,340
"We will give you 72 virgin, one whore -"

474
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,330
"and a goat!"

475
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,410
Hey, you guys have been fun! God bless you! Thank you!

476
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,490
No, she did not tell you that!

477
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,920
Tell me she did not...

478
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,520
No, she did not tell you that! No, she did not!

479
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,430
No!

480
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,260
He's clear!

481
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,490
From Midtown, Palestine.

482
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,690
Aron Kader.

483
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,330
Thank you guys! Thank you for coming out!

484
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,060
What a beautiful crowd, beautiful crowd, beautiful, beautiful.

485
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,650
Thanks for coming. My name's Aron Kader, I'm a Palestinian, any Palestinians here?

486
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,970
[SPEAKING ARABIC]

487
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,280
Yeah, usually Arabs don't come to a comedy show.

488
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,120
I mean, it's really difficult.

489
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,860
I mean, in the past, Arabs would come to the comedy show,

490
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,150
but they'd sit in the back, in the dark, and go,

491
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,350
"Yeah, that was funny, I liked that."

492
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,320
"Very funny, very good."

493
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,200
"Hilarious, my friend."

494
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,010
"Seriously, that's almost, you can almost hear me laugh,"

495
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,520
"it's that good, it's that good."

496
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,250
"Anyone who thinks Arabs don't have a sense of humor, I will kill you and burn your flag."

497
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,360
"I will do it."

498
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,960
"We have a very good sense of humor."

499
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,570
My grandfather, when he emigrated to this country, his name was Abu Hader.

500
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,450
But then at Ellis Island, they changed his name to Kader.

501
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,510
So my last name's Kader, so if I ever have a child, if it's a boy,

502
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,200
I'll definitely name him Al.

503
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,730
Al Kader. That's a good name.

504
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,660
If I have a girl, I'll name her Darfh.

505
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,010
Darfh Kader.

506
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,350
That's a sweet name.

507
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:53,910
My dad comes from a Palestinian family, and my mom comes from a Mormon family from Utah.

508
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,850
Yeah, any Palestinian Mormons here?

509
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,950
Mormons are another group that never comes to see comedy.

510
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,010
They just feel guilty immediately if they laugh, you know, like...

511
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,160
"What am I doing?"

512
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,390
"Ah! I have to read to the kids!"

513
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,810
Yeah, I've got a cousin named Jihad. Any Jihad here?

514
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,370
It's a very popular name in the late seventies.

515
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,040
I got a cousin named Jihad.

516
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,520
He takes the bus now, everywhere.

517
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,330
Can't fly.

518
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,740
Uh...

519
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,740
He called me from a Greyhound station, seriously.

520
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,890
And he called me and he was like,

521
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,910
"This sucks! The police came and IDing me, looking at me funny,"

522
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,500
"screw this, man, I'm changing my name to Raymond!"

523
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,200
Then he changed his name to Raymond...

524
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,140
...Abdul Majid. That doesn't change anything.

525
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,790
Think!

526
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,130
Yeah, growing up Palestinian, too, people would be like,

527
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,460
"What are you, Greek, Italian, Jewish? What are you?"

528
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,450
"Palestinian."

529
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,100
"Pakistilia? What the hell is that..."

530
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,900
"Pakistilia, that sounds made up."

531
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,230
"So where is Pakistilia?"

532
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,410
I'm like, "There's no such country as Pakistilia."

533
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,630
"I guess there's no Palestine, either."

534
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,910
Uh...

535
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,860
"You've ever heard of Israel?"

536
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,990
"Oh, I see, you're Jewish."

537
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,980
"How many rocks do we have to throw, God damn!"

538
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,690
I mean, come on.

539
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,250
"I mean, we're responsible for, like, half the terrors in the last 50 years, huh?"

540
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,430
"Let's pronounce it right: Palestine! Palestine! Pales..."

541
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,890
"Jesus, sorry."

542
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,400
"Whatever, Jew, Jeezz..."

543
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,150
Come on, look at the map.

544
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,940
When I turned 19, the Mormons asked me...

545
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,980
...they pulled me aside, they don't want me to feel left out,

546
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,800
the Mormons asked me if I want to be one of those Mormon missionaries,

547
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,100
you know, the Mormon missionaries?

548
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,840
"I ride a bike, and wear a name tag,"

549
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,390
"and sleep in a bunk bed with another boy for two years."

550
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,570
"I park my hair on one side, and I read one book,"

551
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,300
"and now I get it." you know.

552
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,930
They asked me to be that guy. They're like,

553
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,890
"Have you thought about going on a mission?"

554
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,440
I went, "Yeah, look, to an Arab, a mission's a whole different field."

555
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,330
"Generally, we don't come back from those."

556
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,460
"Thanks for asking."

557
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,260
I have my own little mission, my own little personal mission,

558
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,810
which is to go back to the homeland, right,

559
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,040
go see where my grandma came from, go visit.

560
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,190
I got hundreds of cousins that I just heard about, you know, never met.

561
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,650
So, you know, over the years, I've been there a few times.

562
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,690
Most recently, I was back in the Middle East...

563
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,640
...and, anybody here ever been to the Middle East?

564
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,630
Yeah?

565
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,140
That's great. See, because we've got Middle Eastern people here,

566
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,470
but generally, if somebody said "I've been to Middle East," it's like,

567
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,890
"Marine, Army, Navy, Air Force? Which one?"

568
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,920
But, uh... you know, I went over there after 9/11, and...

569
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,000
and I was visiting a cousin in Amman, Jordan, right?

570
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,180
And I'm driving around with my cousin who's, like,

571
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,290
all bitching and moaning about America, right?

572
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,790
"You son of a bitch, America."

573
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,440
"America, think you're so strong, so powerful, so big and strong."

574
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,610
Arabs love to cuss in English.

575
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,890
They cuss their heads off in English.

576
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,690
They won't do it in Arabic, because then God could hear them, you know.

577
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,930
But in English, no problem.

578
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,630
God doesn't speak English.

579
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,100
"You know, you son of a bitch bastard, United States,"

580
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,400
"think you're so big and strong and powerful, this is bullshit!"

581
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,540
"United States, you are a paper tiger,"

582
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,380
"you will fall. You will see."

583
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,970
"You hungry? You want something to eat?"

584
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,200
"You hungry?"

585
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,610
"We got Burger King, McDonald's, Pizza Hut..."

586
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,460
"...Applebees."

587
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,030
"There's a new place called T.A.I.F. Friday's, looks good."

588
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,280
"You don't want? You look tired."

589
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,200
"You want coffee? We got Starbuckas, you like a Starbuckas?"

590
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,730
"The Starbuckas, I like that place."

591
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,440
"They got a Frappuccino, I like that, that's a good,"

592
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,320
"that's a good drink, have you had? Oh,"

593
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,210
"oh, you've had back in the United States..."

594
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,070
"...son of a bitch."

595
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,780
"United States think they own everything."

596
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,210
"Bullshit!"

597
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,320
"Which hotel are you going to?"

598
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,840
"Sheraton, Hilton, Mariott, what do you got?"

599
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,240
I had to stop my cousin in the middle of this,

600
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,110
and I was like, "Uh, listen, Fayez,"

601
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,080
"if America goes down,"

602
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,500
"we're taking Snickers and Coke and Pepsi and Twix,"

603
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,090
"you know, we're not leaving a McNugget behind, you understand?"

604
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,480
"We go down, it all goes down with us."

605
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,390
And he got mad, and,

606
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,240
stops the car. "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

607
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,090
"You leave these things."

608
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,340
"Leave the Skittle and Kit-kat and the Baby Ruth."

609
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,700
"You want to take something, take KFC, I don't like the honey wings."

610
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,760
"What the hell is a honey wing?"

611
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,980
"Like honey flies with wings, that's American propaganda,"

612
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,820
"that bullshit provocateurs!"

613
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,490
That's when I realize how America dominates, man.

614
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,550
America just dominates with products.

615
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,990
Like I climbed the top of Mount Sinai.

616
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,030
Where Moses spoke to God.

617
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,590
Who did I speak to?

618
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,200
A little Egyptian kid with an igloo cooler going,

619
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,640
"Lipton, Pepsi, Snickers, yeah. You want? Huh?"

620
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,650
How mystical and magical up here.

621
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,010
Honestly, for sure.

622
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,670
But that's how we do it.

623
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,700
We just have products, I mean,

624
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,380
you have 100 percent chance anywhere on earth of finding a Coke.

625
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,740
You'll never go without a Coke or a Pepsi or a Snickers, man,

626
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,580
you can find it 100 percent of the time, everywhere.

627
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,770
You know, you have better than a 50/50 shot of finding a McDonald's.

628
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,480
I mean, other ethnicities, they can't find that. I mean, like,

629
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,080
There's a Chinatown in every big city in North America,

630
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,560
but they don't have a candy bar that sells very well.

631
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,350
You know what I mean? They'll have... The only reason I can think of is...

632
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,850
that we don't like sesame seeds in our candy bars, right?

633
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,630
But other than that, there's a Chinatown in every big...

634
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,650
You mean, how many Chinatowns do you need to see, right?

635
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,010
Once you've seen one Chinatown, you kind of seen them all.

636
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,140
There's Green Dragons and Orange Chickens and Peanut sauce. I got it. You know?

637
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,760
But people aren't always trying to push you to Chinatown.

638
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,610
"Go to Chinatown. Go check it out. The Chinatown is pretty sweet."

639
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,140
If you've seen one Chinatown, like, you've seen it.

640
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,800
I'd like to go to China, and find, like, you know, Americaville.

641
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,370
You know? "USA town, right here!"

642
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,850
"Come on in, man. We've got burgers and fries."

643
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,840
"We've got the satellite dish on with the game,"

644
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,120
"the sheriff's park up back,"

645
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,460
"it's Shang-ri-la! It's China!"

646
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,610
"Let's do it, man! We're chopping wood and burning it."

647
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,990
But Americans don't really leave this country to go...

648
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,230
set up little American communities in other countries, do we?

649
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,000
But we do it.

650
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,640
We call 'em military bases.

651
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,930
A different way of spreading our...

652
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,730
We have military bases in 149 countries and I was like,

653
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,440
"I didn't know there were 149 countries on earth!"

654
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,410
"That's a lot of coun..."

655
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,180
I like the way we went to war, because I was like,

656
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,780
Every time Bush approaches the podium, he does one of these.

657
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,160
Always has his hands out.

658
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,810
I don't know why, but he always gets that look in his face before he talks, like...

659
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,510

"Why are you smiling?"
"Cause I'm serious."

You know, like, he'll get the question and he'll just deflect it altogether,

684
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,880

Wouldn't that be great if he just lost his cool?

695
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,910
Like, he was at an outdoor press conference,

696
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,120
lost his speech in the wind, his little earpiece falls out,

697
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,410

00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,410
"Hello? Hassan, it goes down tomorrow at midnight."

827
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,020
"Who is this?" "Oops, sorry, wrong number."

828
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,490
Even that.

829
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,300
It's funny 'cause actually, I do get those questions,

830
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,950
and I did that joke one night at a show,

831
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,780
and another friend of mine was at the show.

832
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,170
Then he e-mailed me the next day.

833
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,070
He was joking with me. He e-mailed me on my hotmail.

834
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,690
He said, "hey, Maz, had a great time last night at the show."

835
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,270
"By the way, when's the next terrorist hit going down? Ha ha."

836
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,960
So I got on my hotmail and I was like,

837
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,320
well, I'm not being flagged, I can respond, right?

838
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,490
So I was like, "hey, man, I been talking to Al Qaeda,"

839
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:28,790
"And... Um, the next terrorist hit is going down on the lower east of Iceland. Ha ha."

840
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:29,900
Send.

841
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,510
Yeah, next day, I tried to log onto hotmail, account closed, access denied.

842
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,880
I said, "Oh, my God, I got flagged! I got flagged!"

843
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,350
I was freaking out. I tried to contact hotmail, you know.

844
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,730
To tell them I'm a comic. I'm a... I put 'ha ha'!

845
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,820
I put 'ha ha'!

846
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,690
Al Qaeda doesn't put 'ha ha', right?

847
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,270
Al Qaeda doesn't send e-mails, "American pigs must die, ha ha."

848
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,440
They don't do that.

849
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,550
They don't forward e-mails, "you know, Mustafa, you're gonna love this one. LOL. Laugh Out Loud."

850
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,870
They don't do that.

851
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,790
And I tried to contact hotmail, but they don't have a phone number.

852
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,180
I go home, try and look it up, there's no phone number for hotmail.

853
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,720
I tried to find them. I found out who owned them, Microsoft Network.

854
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,560
I called them up. I said, "Hello, Microsoft,"

855
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,380
"you know, I'm having some problems. I'm a comic." And I tried to explain.

856
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,640
They go, "we can't help you out, but we'll put you through to someone who can."

857
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,000
And I swear, I think they passed me through to Iraq,

858
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,800
I think.

859
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:24,480
Because, you know, they used to be, they would send you to India for tech support, you know.

860
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,300
But I think Iraq is cheaper now, I swear to God.

861
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,660
'Cause you know, I know the accent.

862
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,670
You know, if it were India, it'd be like, "Hello, what is going on?"

863
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,210
"Having trouble with your hotmail, we'll take care of it." You know.

864
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,250
But it wasn't, it was an Arabic accent, like,

865
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,720
"What is going on?" And I think it was Iraq,

866
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,470
'cause she was in a rush to get me off the phone, like,

867
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,240
there was a war going on in the background.

868
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,740
I swear, she's like, "What, you're having trouble with your hotmail?"

869
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,510
"There's a fucking war going on here!"

870
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,680
"Just 'cause you put 'ha, ha' doesn't make it funny."

871
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,930
"All right, you're heckling me from Iraq, what's up?"

872
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,090
No, and then it took me weeks. They said, send e-mails.

873
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,710
I had to send e-mails back and forth, weeks, weeks, weeks.

874
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,130
Finally I'm on the internet. I'm so happy, I'm back.

875
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,560
But I'm freaked out on the internet.

876
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,980
You guys should be to. Don't joke on the internet, okay?

877
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,570
Like I'm on that myspace now.

878
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,950
And you can go and join my myspace, you know,

879
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,940
myspace.com/mazjobrani.

880
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,870
Yeah! Yes. Yes.

881
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,490
Add me as a friend, we can be friends,

882
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,920
but don't send me an e-mail going like,

883
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,930
"Hey, Maz, when's the next terrorist hit going down?"

884
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,350
'Cause I'll respond, "Fuck you, I'm a patriot!"

885
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,580
"You're looking for Ahmed Ahmed."

886
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,550
Oh my God.

887
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,870
But no, what I love about what we do with our show, you guys,

888
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,270
is all about putting out the positive, and, and,

889
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:41,220
expressing we can come together and laugh, you know.

890
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,520
Like, I was talking about this, you know. I'm originally a muslim,

891
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,340
but I have friends from all religions, all ethnicities.

892
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,600
I've told them, "Man, you're celebrating your religion,"

893
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,630
"let me know. I'm coming and I'm celebrating with you."

894
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,790
And I've done it. Yeah! Yes!

895
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,030
Yeah! Yeah, man.

896
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,820
I have, I have Christian friends, and Bahain friends,

897
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,790
and Jewish friends, all I've celebrated with.

898
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,440
My Jewish friend, one time, actually invited me over for Sabbath dinner one time.

899
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,310
Friday night.

900
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,600
Yes, I went, I had it, it was a great time.

901
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,800
They gave me a matzah ball, I ate it. It was delicious.

902
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,900
It was. Give me a yamaka, I put it on, it was cool.

903
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,370
Yeah. But it was weird.

904
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,620
'Cause as soon as I prop the yamaka, I started to cover up with business ideas.

905
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,810
Is that supposed to happen?

906
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,430
My IQ increased by 20 points.

907
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,630
My practical's doubled. It was strange.

908
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,080
No, actually I did come out with business ideas,

909
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,430
when I propped the yamaka, and I'm bald,

910
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,660
it started sliding. I was like, "dude, you need like a velcro yamaka."

911
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,310
And he's like, "we can't do that."

912
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:41,470
I go, "what about suction cup yamaka?"

913
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,760
That's a brilliant idea. Just lick it, and,

914
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,050
Hava nagila.

915
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,830
No, man. It is cool, though, you know.

916
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,700
And the thing that frustrates me is...

917
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,840
...when I see us on TV nowadays, who they always showed?

918
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,130
They always show the crazy dude burning American flag, going,

919
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,210
"Death to America!"
Always that guy.

920
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,090
Just once, I wish they would show us doing something good, man.

921
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,760
Right? Just once, right?

922
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,240
Yeah, man! Right?

923
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,550
Show us out! Show us doing something good.

924
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,210
Like, you know, like, baking a cookie or something, right?

925
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,200
'Cause up in Iran, we have cookies.

926
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,630
Just once, I want CNN to be like,

927
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,180
"Now we're gonna go to Mohammed in Iran."

928
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,480
They go to some guy, like, "Hello, I'm Mohammed."

929
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,220
"And I'm just baking a cookie."

930
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,570
"I swear to God. No bombs, no flag, nothing."

931
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,890
"Back to you, Bob."

932
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,710
"Do the whole news piece."

933
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,820
They're never gonna do that.

934
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,840
Even if they ever did that, they will follow it up with another news piece.

935
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,360
It will be like, "This just in. A cookie bomb just exploded."

936
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,780
"Mohammed, you sneaky Persian."

937
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,510
Always, we get the bad end.

938
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,570
Like in the World Cup. You guys watch the World Cup?

939
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,180
You saw the World Cup, right? Right?

940
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,760
The famous headbutt? You saw the headbutt, right?

941
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,700
And it was the French dude, Zinedine Zidane,

942
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,310
and the Italian dude, Materazzi,

943
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,300
and they were... It looks peaceful, it looks peaceful.

944
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,290
And they're walking back, and Materazzi grabs Zidane's jersey,

945
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,120
and Zidane turns to him, and was like,

946
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,590
"You can have it after the game."

947
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,620
You know, like, to say, like,

948
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,750
"Oh, you are gay. Let's go." You know that kind of thing?

949
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,610
Yeah, and the Italian guy was like, "Hey, I'd rather a-banging your sister."

950
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:13,460
That's what he said.

951
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,640
Yeah. And Zidane was like, "You don't talk about my sister!" Like that, you know.

952
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,870
And he went over, he headbutt him,

953
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,920
Boom! Right in the chest.

954
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,500
And the Italian guy was like, "Ow, that a-hurt!" And he went down.

955
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,250
Yeah!

956
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,040
But what I observed as a Middle Eastern,

957
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,760
and I watched the French's reaction. And before the whole thing,

958
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,560
the French loved Zidane. They were like, "We love Zinedine Zidane."

959
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,340
"Zinedine Zidane is one of ours. He's a French Champion!"

960
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,790
"We love him!"

961
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,990
"He's the best, Zinedine Zidane. We call him <i>Zizou</i>. He's the sharp!"

962
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:37,920
"We love him!"

963
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,280
After the headbutt, they're like, "This fucking guy's Algerian."

964
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,780
"He's muslim! We should have known it all along."

965
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,980
"They are crazy!"

966
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,720
We get the bad rap, man.

967
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,320
You know who's doing well in breaking stereotypes

968
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,850
in mainstream media, and I'm proud of them, are Asians.

969
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,450
Breaking stereotypes in mainstream media,

970
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,340
this is how I figured this one. I was watching,

971
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,680
there was a car commercial for Mercedes Benz.

972
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,930
And the drivers of the car in the commercial,

973
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,060
were Asians.

974
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,480
Yeah, how crazy is that?

975
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,000
Right? 'Cause it's the stereotype.

976
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,780
The stereotype is "Asians can't drive."

977
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,140
That's the stereotype, right?

978
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:18,050
But Mercedes is like, "No, they can drive."

979
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,800
"They will drive. They'll drive our cars."

980
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,100
Right, I mean, if you want to read between the lines,

981
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,730
you could say Mercedes is making a racist statement, you know.

982
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,550
You could say Mercedes's saying "Hey, we're a safe car."

983
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,370
"So safe, even Asians can drive it."

984
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,300
But, at least there's Asians in commercials breaking stereotypes, right?

985
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,260
Middle Easterners aren't breaking stereotypes,

986
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,430
not in commercials.

987
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,770
Right, you never turn on the TV,

988
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,560
and see a United Airlines commercial with a Middle Eastern pilot.

989
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,630
Right, they'll never see me saying like, "Come fly the friendly skies."

990
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,720
"I dare you."

991
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,070
And here's my thing, too.

992
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,620
People are cool, man. People are cool.

993
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,890
Politicians mess it up.

994
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,500
Politicians put us all against each other, man. I don't like any of them.

995
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,790
Ours, theirs, none of 'em.

996
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,550
And like, Bush? I can't believe he's the president.

997
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,030
Even if you voted for him, you gotta admit, you gotta admit,

998
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,850
every time he's on TV, he just doesn't look presidential.

999
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,290
He doesn't. Every time Bush is on TV, I'm watching him, like,

1000
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,860
"He's not the president."

1001
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,840
Someone's pulling our leg, someone's messing with us.

1002
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,290
Every time I see Bush on TV, I'm waiting for Ashton Kutcher,

1003
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,870
saying "You've all been punk'ed!"

1004
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,370
Right?

1005
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,860
Osama comes running out of his cave,

1006
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,760
he's like, "I was in on it, too!"

1007
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,180
Makes sense.

1008
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,020
Osama has been hiding for six years.

1009
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,060
Think about it. That's a good hider, people.

1010
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,960
That guy is great. I can't hide for more than six minutes.

1011
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,930
This guy's doing it for six years!

1012
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,970
Osama is like the Michael Jordan of hiders.

1013
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,500
Just think about it. I bet he's come out of high school,

1014
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,310
he was voted the most likely to hide.

1015
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:51,730
Right?

1016
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,900
And I bet when he was a kid, whenever he's gonna play hide-and-seek,

1017
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,620
the other kids were pissed cause they knew the game was gonna take forever.

1018
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,580
Talking, they like, "You let Osama play?"

1019
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,870
"Oh, shit!"

1020
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,760
"The game's gonna take six years, you know."

1021
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,160
"OK, fine. Go hide. I'll count, asshole!"

1022
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,850
"One, two..."

1023
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,540
"We're gonna miss our high school graduation."

1024
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,690
"Three, four,"

1025
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,510
"He's so tall. How does he do it?"

1026
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,260
"Five, six... Is he gonna hide in his cave again?"

1027
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,890
"Seven, eight... and put up a videotape?"

1028
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,560
Osama is actually heard recently,

1029
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,280
he had a magazine, he put out a magazine called, uh...

1030
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,820
<i>Jihad Magazine</i>.

1031
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,760
He did, he did. I'm like, what,

1032
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,350
"What kind of article is in that?"

1033
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,690
Like, you know where's there's "Fifty ways to lose weight."

1034
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,320
"Number one: blow yourself up."

1035
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,470
They're like,

1036
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,910
"Mustafa lost 200 pounds in one second."

1037
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,380
Iran...

1038
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,740
Politicians of Iran are talking shit to America.

1039
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,840
Why... Why would you talk shit to America?

1040
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,240
America has recently bombed your neighbors.

1041
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,420
America has bombed Iraq and Afghanistan.

1042
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,790
Iran is in the middle.

1043
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,380
It's a good time to be quiet.

1044
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,560
Right? Right? Right?

1045
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,790
It's like being in a nightclub and the bouncer has knocked out your friends,

1046
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,670
and you're still talking shit, right? Come on...

1047
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,400
I'll tell you why Iran is talking shit.

1048
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,710
There's a lot of opium usage in Iran.

1049
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,660
Yes, the politicians are high.

1050
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,180
You have to be high to talk shit to America.

1051
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,080
'Cause opium's supposed to mellow you out,

1052
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,860
but I think it also makes you delusional.

1053
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,220
I do, I think they're getting high and they're going, "Hey, you know what we should do?"

1054
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,720
"Let's call America."

1055
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,440
"Give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the phone, give..."

1056
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:39,720
"Let me talk, let me talk, I feel good, let me talk..."

1057
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,970
"Hello, America."

1058
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,230
"Fuck you!"

1059
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,210
"Bring it on, bitch!"

1060
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:56,610
"We'll kick your ass!"

1061
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,220
And then they hang up and they go, "Hey, guys, do we have a military?"

1062
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,810
"Oh, we don't?"

1063
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,810
"Oh, America, just kidding!"

1064
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,670
"I am Persian. Meow!"

1065
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,700
Bullshit!

1066
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,420
The next day, the president of Iran's like,

1067
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,550
"Did I drunk dial Bush again last night?"

1068
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,720
"I'll stop drunk orange juice."

1069
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,440
That's the beauty of this country, guys.

1070
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,210
We can have these debates, we can talk about this.

1071
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,570
We should be critical of government, of politicians.

1072
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,570
You should be and that's the beauty of this country.

1073
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,200
And that's why we have to have these open debates.

1074
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,210
It's like, I couldn't be making fun of the president of Iran in Iran.

1075
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:38,670
Right?

1076
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,670
You'd be like, "Hey, Maz, that was a good show. When's your next show?"

1077
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:42,340
I'd be like, "There are no more shows."

1078
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,730
"The ministry of No-Show showed up."

1079
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,900
"My next show will be in prison and I'll be performing like this."

1080
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,400
"You know, I think that's one joke."

1081
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:53,660
"And, uh..."

1082
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,390
"They didn't like it."

1083
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,280
I was expressing myself one night at a comedy club,

1084
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,560
talking about peace, and this one guy disagreed with me.

1085
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,730
He starts going "Booo!"

1086
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,850
And I go "You're booing peace?"

1087
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:09,750
He goes "Yeah!"

1088
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,550
I go "You're an idiot!"
He goes "You're an idiot!"

1089
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,070
I go "I'm gonna kick your ass!"
He goes "I'm gonna kick your ass!"

1090
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,290
And I started losing control, I was like, "Whoa whoa, wait a minute."

1091
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:19,310
"I started talking about peace, and I'm losing myself? What's going on?"

1092
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,130
And I have to stop and think in mind, like,

1093
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,970
Did heroes of peace ever lose it?

1094
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:25,100
Did Martin Luther King Jr. ever just lose it?

1095
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,040
Did Gandhi ever lose it, right?

1096
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,500
Did anyone ever say something to Gandhi, he was like,

1097
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,110
"All right. That's it. The loincloth is coming off!"

1098
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,150
"Let's go!"

1099
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,720
"Pull down his sandals while I kick his ass. Let's go!"

1100
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:35,700
"Premat!"

1101
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:37,120
"Oh my God, I can't fight."

1102
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,730
"You're lucky I let two grain of rice today. I'm so tired."

1103
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,520
"I'm so tired."

1104
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,520
Speaking of Indian, actually I got married to an Indian woman,

1105
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,020
uh, a year ago.

1106
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,090
Yes, yes.

1107
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,740
Beautiful Indian woman.

1108
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,360
I have to clarify this.

1109
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,080
People go, "Wow, Indians are..."
[BLABBING]

1110
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,540
then you know, and I was...

1111
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,770
I was gonna say "No, not casino Indian, computer Indian." You know what I'm saying.

1112
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,550
Yes. Yes.

1113
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:07,510
I married tech-support. That's right.

1114
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,410
That's right.

1115
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,770
Anytime I got a computer problem,

1116
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,090
"Honey, Windows XP isn't working."

1117
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,210
She's like, "I will take care of it."

1118
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,570
You know, she does. She does.

1119
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,680
No, she doesn't talk like that. She grew up here.

1120
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,810
But that's a fun accent to do. Any time you feel sad,

1121
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,960
just go "<i>How-do-do-toy.</i>" That'll cheer you up.

1122
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:25,840
I swear to God.

1123
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,260
OK, I'm gonna leave you guys with this.

1124
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,260
Real quickly. I'm gonna leave you with this.

1125
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,770
Please. I always say this. Please,

1126
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,150
Stop blaming Middle Easterners for everything, OK?

1127
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,760
And I always say it's not always us.

1128
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:35,800
Right?

1129
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,390
It is not always us, OK? I mean,

1130
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,790
Quite often, it is, but not always.

1131
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,590
We get blamed for everything.

1132
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,090
Whatever happens. Like there was a blackout in New York a few years ago.

1133
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,050
The news came on, they're like,

1134
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,050
"There's been a blackout, terrorists might have been involved."

1135
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,150
Then a week later, they're like, "Oops, sorry, just Enron," right?

1136
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,030
"There's a traffic jam on the Five, terrorists might be involved."

1137
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,870
"Oops, sorry. Just cars." You know, it's like...

1138
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,220
And it started with the anthrax.

1139
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,120
Remember, the anthrax, they tried to blame on us?

1140
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,900
I knew that wasn't a Middle Easterner.

1141
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,730
That's not now the Middle Easterners work.

1142
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,360
Right? Middle Easterner was like "What, you want me to put the anthrax in the envelope,"

1143
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,180
"put the stamp on the envelope and mail it?"

1144
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,520
"No, no, no, no, no."

1145
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,960
"That is not how I do it, no, no."

1146
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,090
"Can I wrap the anthrax around myself and run into somebody?"

1147
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,560
"That is how I do it."

1148
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,500
"You know, one, two, bang, like, that, you know what I'm saying?"

1149
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,740
"I can get two people, one, two, that's it."

1150
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,760
"Any more, I hurt my back."

1151
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,580
"One, two, ow, it hurts."

1152
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,370
"I've been in a cave for six years with Osama. I'm old."

1153
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,760
We all know who did the anthrax. It was some hillbilly dude.

1154
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:38,970
You know some redneck was like,

1155
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,640
"Right about now's a good time to send out some anthrax."

1156
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,140
"Blame the god damn A-rabs, that's what I'll do."

1157
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,610
"Blame them god damn kebab-eating, Mercedes-Benz driving,"

1158
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,260
"camel riding, 7-eleven owning, Slurpee selling, gas price raising,"

1159
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,000
"uni-brow connected, hairy-chested motherfuckers!"

1160
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,110
Right?

1161
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:55,410
Right?

1162
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,000
You know it was.

1163
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,800
And they have not caught him yet. I hope they catch that guy eventually,

1164
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,830
because that'll make everyone realize we got haters of all kinds, you guys.

1165
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,590
White, black, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin, all kinds of haters.

1166
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,330
And what we have to do as a people is counter the hate with some love, right?

1167
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,430
Yes, spread the love, man.

1168
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,800
Right? I mean, they're going around,

1169
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,370
they were putting anthrax in the mail, they were putting anthrax in the water.

1170
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,370
Hey, man, you wanna put something in my water?

1171
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,470
Put some ecstasy in my water.

1172
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,950
That's the kind of terrorist I'm looking for.

1173
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,670
Right? I drink the water, I'm like this...

1174
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,460

1175
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,880

1180
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:03,620
You guys, that's my time. That's our show.
