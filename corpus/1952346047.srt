1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,152
Are you ready?

2
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,655
- Yeah.
- You look scared.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,866
- I am.
- Why are you scared?

4
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,661
The football might hit me
in the face.

5
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:23,579
We don't have to play catch.
We could play somethin'else.

6
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:26,457
I want to play this, Grandpa.

7
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:29,168
I'm gonna throw it real light.

8
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:32,879
- Okay.
- Keep your hands out.

9
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:35,882
- Okay.
- Joshua?

10
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:39,552
- Yeah, Grandpa?
- Open your eyes.

11
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:43,556
- Okay.
- Here it comes! Get set!

12
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,558
Here it comes!

13
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:50,478
- You did it!
- I did it! I did it!

14
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:58,152
- That was a good throw.
- That was a good catch.

15
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:02,364
- We're a great team, aren't we?
- Yes, we are.

16
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:05,450
We're a great team.
That we are.

17
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,548
Joshua? Time to wake up.

18
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:30,055
Joshua?

19
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,057
Please?

20
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:35,477
You're a fiifth grader today.
You're almost a man.

21
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,359
Wow.

22
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:47,737
How much longer are
we gonna do this, huh?

23
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:50,448
This isn't gonna work anymore.

24
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,869
Here we go.

25
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:13,760
Josh?

26
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:17,055
I need you in the car, pal.
15 minutes. Let's go.

27
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:23,268
Joshua?

28
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,737
- Did you fiind it?
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks.

29
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,865
Breakfast.

30
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,036
Is the smurf ready yet?
He better not make me late.

31
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,353
My grandpa and me...

32
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:02,231
we always watched out
for each other.

33
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:06,735
I slept in his room
when I was sick...

34
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:09,946
or when I had a bad dream.

35
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,656
Last time, I had both.

36
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:35,552
Your fever's down.

37
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:37,553
I dreamt you were gone.

38
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:40,431
Couldn't fiind you.

39
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,433
I'm not goin' anywhere.

40
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,520
Promise?

41
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,648
Promise.

42
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:54,819
He lied.

43
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,243
- Dad!
- Josh, time to go.

44
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,327
come on!

45
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,627
My name is Joshua A. Beal.

46
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:16,130
I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

47
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:20,341
I go to WaldronAcademy
catholic School for Boys.

48
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,927
Don't laugh.

49
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:35,313
My dad's a great dad,
but he always ends with the same thing.

50
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,815
Do me a favor. Just...

51
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,942
try to agree with the nuns...

52
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:42,236
and not give them
any trouble in class, okay?

53
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:48,033
People think I ask too many questions.

54
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:53,246
Okay. See ya later.

55
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,626
Wave to your brother.

56
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:16,641
Those are the guys in my school.

57
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,643
Kids in uniforms
don't smile very much.

58
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:45,041
All right, gentlemen, religion class
assignments will be divided between...

59
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,627
readings from your text,
Next Stop;'Salvation...

60
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,005
and exercises in your workbook,
Jesus Is My Buddy.

61
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,799
Quizzes will be held
every two weeks...

62
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:56,510
not during holy days
and not during the play-offs.

63
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:59,513
Yes,Joshua?

64
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:02,098
In our workbook...

65
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,725
it says that you
have to be baptized...

66
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,228
to save your soul
from eternal damnation.

67
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,438
That's correct.

68
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,606
Is that your question?

69
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:15,402
No, no. My question's
about my Aunt Denise.

70
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:20,406
She's not baptized, so that means
she's going to hell, right?

71
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:23,534
- Uh, no. Actually, she's not,Joshua.
- And my dad's best friend...

72
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,911
He's not baptized, either.
And that means he's going to hell.

73
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,995
- Joshua, I think you misunderstood. Wh...
- Oh, man!

74
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:31,207
Seth Greenberg rides my bus.
He's not baptized.

75
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:34,335
- Okay, wait a second.
- Hey. My cousin's going to hell?

76
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:36,920
- No, I don't think...
- We have an Indian family living next door.

77
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,214
And the whole house
is going to hell.

78
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:41,800
- No, that's not what
it says in the book.

79
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,301
If you'll notice on page f... okay.

80
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,303
All right. Qiet.

81
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,309
No one is going to hell.

82
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:54,728
Do you mean the Bible's wrong?

83
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,900
No, the Bible's not wrong.

84
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,319
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

85
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,905
No.

86
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:13,327
Okay. Well...

87
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,622
Tomorrow, we'll begin with
an in-depth discussion on baptism.

88
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,207
Until then, please do not
inform any of your friends...

89
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,502
neighbors or relatives
of their impending doom.

90
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,089
Thank you very much, gentlemen. Go in
peace, and don't run in the hallways.

91
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:31,594
"Is it vain, sir,
to extenuate the matter?

92
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,805
Peace, peace. "

93
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,806
Don't just say the words.

94
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,100
Read them fiirst,
understand them...

95
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,728
and then make us
understand them.

96
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,897
" But there is no peace.

97
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:48,901
The war is actually begun.

98
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:52,987
The next gale
that sweeps from the north...

99
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:56,491
will bring to our ears... "

100
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:59,619
Aw! Ick!

101
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:03,622
That's heinous, man!

102
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:06,708
Sister?
May I go to the bathroom?

103
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,919
You should really
carry tissues, David.

104
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:14,006
Go ahead.

105
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,884
"The next gale that
sweeps from the north...

106
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:21,888
will bring
to our ears the clash... "

107
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:24,891
Good mucous attack.

108
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,892
I've had better.

109
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:31,105
Nine months.
I can't do it.

110
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:34,316
Know what?
The fiirst week's always bad.

111
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,694
And besides,
if there was no school...

112
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:39,696
there'd be no rules to break.

113
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:43,615
My best friend Dave
is the adventurous type...

114
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,617
a daredevil.

115
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:48,286
Boring things like school
give him headaches.

116
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:53,499
Today he's having one of his
"I hate these wussy uniform"headaches.

117
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:59,296
Shit. Brickman.

118
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:02,590
I can't deal with
Mr. Bizarre-o on the fiirst day.

119
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:05,176
- To the back stairs, Robin.
- Right, Batman.

120
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,308
- Morning.
- Hi.

121
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:26,194
Brickman is such a weirdo.

122
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:34,994
He's weirder...
than a regular weirdo.

123
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:39,206
He's lord of all weirdos.

124
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:43,585
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:46,588
Robert's having
a bad day, it seems.

126
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,978
It's funny;'
When you fiirst get an idea...

127
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:07,273
sometimes it comes
when you look at something...

128
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:10,984
you've looked at
a hundred million times.

129
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,198
You ever think about God?

130
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:20,576
We go to Catholic school.
God's, like, our homework.

131
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:24,205
- No, really.
- No. I don't think about God.

132
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:27,207
- Do you think He's real?
- Nope.

133
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:31,586
- Why not?
- Too many bad things happen to people for no reason.

134
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,296
If you believe in him, it's cool.

135
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,800
I drink chocolate milk through my nose.
What do I know?

136
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,179
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

137
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,894
We have recess!

138
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:08,076
Oh, come on.

139
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,578
I'll get it.

140
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,378
Meet Freddie Waltman.

141
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,588
Oh, I'm sorry, ball boy.

142
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:23,882
Did you want that?

143
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:27,093
Every kid my size has
to deal with a Freddie Waltman.

144
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:29,262
See that new kid?

145
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:31,264
He's even smaller than me.

146
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,765
He hasn't got a prayer.

147
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:43,691
I don't know why
they put this fence up.

148
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:48,195
Why would anyone want to go
over there anyway?

149
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:50,864
Hey,Josh.

150
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:53,658
Do you want to play
ninjas with me?

151
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:55,660
Tomorrow, Frank.

152
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,787
Really?
Tomorrow?

153
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:00,456
Yeah. Tomorrow.

154
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,875
I gotta go.
They need me.

155
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:07,795
That's Frank Bennett. He sweats a lot.

156
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,262
My parents are
really busy people.

157
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:20,182
You have to know
when to ask them something.

158
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:28,189
What?

159
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:31,275
- Hmm?
- Do you hear something?

160
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:33,485
- No.
- Oh.

161
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:37,656
Can I ask
you guys something?

162
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,867
- Joshua?
- Not the lights.

163
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,868
What's wrong?

164
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm just wondering if...

165
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:48,165
I could join the football team?

166
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:53,962
Mom, please?

167
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:57,090
Josh, we're physicians, okay?
Trust us on this.

168
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:59,049
You haven't been
in an emergency room.

169
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:02,386
You haven't seen a compound fracture
or a ruptured spleen...

170
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:06,390
- or severe facial lacerations, okay?
- Dad, I'm not going to war.

171
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,267
- The answer is no.
- Don't worry,Josh. You won't be a nerd all your life.

172
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,770
- Not the lights.
- Neena?

173
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:17,983
- I heard voices.
- come on, Mom. We wear pads and all.

174
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:22,153
- You can't get hurt.
- Listen to your mother,Josh. Please?

175
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,446
You can always become
a midget wrestler and wrestle on TV.

176
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:27,282
- They can call you "The Pygmy... "
- " From Pennsylvania. "

177
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,284
Get some new material.

178
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,870
Play football all of a sudden.
What's the big deal?

179
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:36,582
Just give me one good reason.
One.

180
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,377
Grandpa played football.

181
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:08,444
Okay, okay.
Let's go, girls.

182
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:10,654
Rows of fiive.
Shoulder length apart.

183
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,658
Legs together.
Touch your toes and don't bounce.

184
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:19,078
Ready? One, two, three, four.

185
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:21,164
Two, two, three, four.

186
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:23,166
Get down there!
Get down there!

187
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,167
Grab some dirt.
Let's go.

188
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,544
Three. I can't hear you!

189
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,880
- Four.
- Is that the way we do this drill?

190
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,548
- Five.
- You our mascot or somethin'?

191
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,842
- Six.
- No.

192
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,846
- Seven. Eight.
- I tried out, but your mom got the job fiirst.

193
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:46,353
Hey, break it up over there!

194
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,772
Hey!
What the hell's this?

195
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,273
Smurf was bustin' on my moms.

196
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:54,068
You must be in advanced English.

197
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:03,159
My grandpa was
a really great football player.

198
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,745
He ran for 200 yards in one game.

199
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:09,164
He believed in two things;'

200
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:11,750
Always keep both hands on the ball...

201
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,752
and always hold on to your faith.

202
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:16,671
- Thou art with me.
- Faith will get you through.

203
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:19,465
Thy rod and Thy staff... they comfort me.

204
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:23,259
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

205
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:25,470
Thou anointest my head with oil.

206
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:28,264
My cup runneth over.

207
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:32,434
Surely, goodness and mercy will
follow me all the days of my life...

208
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:35,145
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

209
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,150
Today, we would like
to begin communion...

210
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,360
with those members
of the congregation...

211
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:45,530
suffering illness
and physical ailments.

212
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:53,370
I didn't know Mrs. Pittman was sick.

213
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,847
The Body of christ.

214
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,937
The Body of christ.

215
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:30,445
Our Father, who art in heaven...

216
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:32,446
hallowed be Thy name.

217
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:35,449
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

218
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,951
on Earth, as it is in heaven.

219
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:40,036
Give us this day
our daily bread...

220
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:42,163
and forgive us our trespasses...

221
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:45,041
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

222
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,762
Grandpa was my mom's dad.

223
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:03,933
He was the one who told her to go
to medical school when she was a girl.

224
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,242
I miss him too.

225
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:46,929
Football isn't the answer.

226
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:49,931
It's time I told Dave
about my idea.

227
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:55,436
Dave O'Hara lives
in a really big house.

228
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:59,231
But he spends most
of his time in a closet...

229
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:02,818
three feet by fiive feet,
under the stairs.

230
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:05,945
We've been hit!
Abort mission!

231
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:09,448
Negative, Lieutenant. We have orders.
We have to go faster.

232
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:13,035
We're already at light speed!
They're gaining!

233
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,913
- We're gonna be barbecued!
- Lieutenant, sound alarm: DEFCON 1.

234
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:19,624
Fighter craft, four o'clock.

235
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,715
How come you never
talk about girls?

236
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,717
Don't know.

237
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:32,635
What do you think about her?

238
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,637
Oh, she's okay.

239
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:38,433
For someone who's so smart,
you're pretty stupid.

240
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:42,519
Likin' girls,
it's just a biological reaction.

241
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:46,023
" Biological reaction"?
What kind?

242
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:50,735
Well, I don't know.
I haven't had one yet.

243
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:58,241
- You know what, Dave?
- What?

244
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:01,244
I'm goin' on a mission.
A real mission.

245
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:03,413
What kind of mission?

246
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:05,831
The kind where you're looking
for something important.

247
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,917
What are you gonna look for?

248
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,921
God.

249
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,923
God? What for?

250
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,634
I just want to talk to Him.

251
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:22,220
- Why?
- To make sure my grandpa's okay.

252
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,727
Remember when you told me
I was stupid for staring at...

253
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,021
that bug lamp on my porch
for six hours...

254
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:34,231
hoping that purple light
would have gamma rays...

255
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:36,609
and turn me into the Incredible Hulk
so I could fiight crime?

256
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:40,236
- Yeah?
- You're mission is more stupid than that.

257
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:43,740
- Why?
- 'cause you can't look for God.

258
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:48,619
- Why not?
- Where in the world are you gonna look?

259
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,830
Action News. What you want
to know when you want to know it.

260
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:55,042
Thirty-six hours
of steady rainfall have left...

261
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,001
- many members of the metro
area in flood waters.

262
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:59,504
Power was out for three hours
because of downed...

263
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:03,007
...still burning out of control.
Firefiighters from as far away as...

264
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:06,426
- You know, Mom,you won't believe it.
- What? What won't I believe?

265
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:09,429
- Cardinal Geary is coming to our school.
- Oh, a cardinal. Well.

266
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:11,431
Grab your books.

267
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:14,433
...trying feverishly to extricate
survivors from the wreckage.

268
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:16,435
According to police, the death toll
currently stands at seven.

269
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,230
Okay, come on.
Let's go.

270
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,109
Cardinal Geary is famous.

271
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:26,736
- I mean, people say he can do miracles and things.
- Yeah?

272
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:29,613
- I'm getting out of English...
I usually don't listen...

273
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:34,410
to my sister very much,
but you know what she said?

274
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,829
Cardinal Geary? Some people even think
he can talk to God.

275
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,622
This guy's bugging the phones, huh?

276
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,917
If she wasn't my sister,
I would've hugged her.

277
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,422
So basically what we had is bottom
of the eighth of the World Series.

278
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:52,718
It was bases loaded, tie score,
Jesus up at bat.

279
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,511
Strike one, strike two.
He never strikes out.

280
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:58,598
He's kind of shocked. He looks up, and who
does He see playing on the other team?

281
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,933
Judas.
That's right,Judas.

282
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:05,103
A pitcher, a traitor about to strike out
Jesus Christ, the big man.

283
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:07,522
- That's all for today.
Your assignment for this evening.

284
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:10,817
Homework;'If you were captain of the apostles
team, who would you pick to bat cleanup?

285
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,111
Remember, don't leave
the line too soon.

286
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:16,113
You know what?
Maybe I shouldn't go.

287
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:18,115
Dude, nothing is gonna go wrong.

288
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:20,492
When I distract the sister,
just do your thing and step.

289
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:22,827
- What are you gonna do?
- What would James Bond do?

290
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,830
You're going to hit on
Sister Beatrice?

291
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,790
I'll do something.
Don't worry.

292
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:33,128
Hey,Josh,
if you can talk to God...

293
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:36,089
ask Him if we could get
a couple more days off for Christmas.

294
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:45,097
catholic school's
a lot like being in prison.

295
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:52,312
They're both very, very hard
to escape from.

296
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:58,400
- Hands at your side.
Attention, students.

297
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,695
Will the fiifth, sixth and seventh graders
please line up in the main hallway...

298
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:04,822
for afternoon mass
in a calm and orderly fashion.

299
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:36,309
Beal!

300
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:40,312
Wa-hoo!

301
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,791
Woo-hoo!

302
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:08,004
Woo!

303
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,201
I just gotta do something.

304
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:45,786
Please don't tell anyone.

305
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:54,085
Oh. Oh, yeah.
It'll sound the alarm otherwise.

306
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,589
Good thinkin'.

307
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:45,798
Are you lost?
What are you doing here?

308
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,094
What's the matter?

309
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:52,888
I think I'm having
a biological reaction.

310
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:54,889
What?

311
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:57,267
Um, m-my sister
Neena goes here.

312
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:59,185
I'm looking for Cardinal Geary.

313
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:03,689
Oh. He's visiting.
We can look for him if you want.

314
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:07,484
If anybody asks,
you're my cousin.

315
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:10,486
- What's your name?
- Hope. What's yours?

316
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,282
Joshua A. Beal.

317
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:03,783
Do girls always
freak out when someone comes to lecture?

318
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:05,869
They're just trying
to get out of class.

319
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,788
They don't know
how important this is.

320
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:38,856
I wanted to ask you about my...

321
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:05,171
The cardinal gets...
very drained after a lecture.

322
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,967
The cardinal looks diff,erent up close.

323
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:15,264
He looks like somebody's grandpa.

324
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:26,565
Josh, what happened?
What are you doing here?

325
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,861
I don't think
God talks to him.

326
00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:42,079
Know what?

327
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:44,747
This mission could take days.

328
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:04,765
Still got it.

329
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:08,060
catholic school is based on rules.

330
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,061
The nuns have their rules;'

331
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:14,065
no food on the trays,
no crumbs left on the table.

332
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:17,943
Let's bolt.
You children had enough to eat?

333
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:26,951
And we have our rules;'
never eat the tuna casserole...

334
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:29,662
and when it's your turn,
pass the trays.

335
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:41,965
The kitchen workers are the only adults
who know about our rules.

336
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:44,342
They empty the trash cans.

337
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:47,470
They don't say anything.

338
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:52,641
- I think a couple of them went to catholic school too.
- That apple has to be eaten.

339
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,570
The fiifth grade is confession
with Father Peters...

340
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:09,739
the fiirst Thursday of every month.

341
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:12,659
No one ever really confesses.

342
00:30:12,742 --> 00:30:16,162
We make up stuff, as we wait on line.

343
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:19,456
I think Father Peters knows
we're lying, though.

344
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:22,334
It's just the way
he looks at us...

345
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:25,170
kinda sad,you know?

346
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:27,838
How long has it been
since your last confession?

347
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:31,050
Can we just talk?

348
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,846
Of course.

349
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:39,432
Know what?
You and me are, like, the same.

350
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,561
- We are?
- Yeah. You're looking for God, right?

351
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:47,356
As often as I can, yes.

352
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:49,358
Well, so am I.

353
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,359
Is that right?

354
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:53,736
Father Peters?

355
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:57,740
- you're not allowed to lie to me, right?
- What do you mean?

356
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:01,034
Well, I want to ask you something.

357
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,246
And I don't want you to, like, make up
stuff'cause I'm ten or anything.

358
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:09,041
I'll give it to you straight,Joshua.
I promise.

359
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,964
Well, do you ever
feel like givin' up?

360
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:18,842
I mean, since it's been so long,
and all. You haven't met Him.

361
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:21,344
How do you even know
if He's made up or not?

362
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:27,641
Sometimes, I do feel like giving up.

363
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:30,144
But one thing I've learned
is that...

364
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:35,231
doubt's a part of
everyone's journey...

365
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:37,859
no matter what
they're looking for.

366
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:42,237
It ain't easy.

367
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:47,159
I know.

368
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:49,161
Thanks, Father.

369
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:51,662
If you fiind anything out
about where He might be...

370
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:54,123
you'll let me know, right?

371
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:59,544
You'll be the fiirst I'll tell.

372
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,546
Is it me...

373
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,633
or is it weird that the nuns are
always in here while we change?

374
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,927
I mean, we are men.

375
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:14,433
Ah,you're wiggin'.
Nuns and moms...

376
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,352
I mean, they don't count.
They're not like women.

377
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,354
Stop him! Sister Sabrina!

378
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,357
- What's going on?
- Brickman's at it again...

379
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,525
running around naked
with his underwear on his head.

380
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,029
- Oh! Robert Brickman!
- Lord of the weirdos.

381
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:31,949
Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em.
Seven, eight.

382
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:34,825
Keep your arms up!

383
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:37,036
I saw that, Kozak!

384
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,123
Thanks to Kozak,
we are starting over!

385
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,129
One, two, three.
Keep your arms up.

386
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:51,340
I heard it's gonna snow tonight.

387
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:55,344
You say that every day. Every day,
I wake up and I see the grass.

388
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:58,638
This is straight from CNN.
CNN don't lie.

389
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:02,433
- Really?
- I guarantee we won't have school tomorrow.

390
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:06,020
Hey,Josh.
Is today tomorrow?

391
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,731
- Do you wanna play now?
- No. Today's today.

392
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:12,150
Tomorrow's tomorrow.

393
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:14,736
Beal!
Keep it quiet!

394
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:18,114
Thanks to Beal,
we're starting over.

395
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:21,742
One, two...

396
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:25,036
three, four, fiive...

397
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,331
Here! Pass it, pass it!

398
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:35,921
All right.
Bring it in. Bring it in to me.

399
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:50,642
Wait.

400
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:56,732
Look out, Freddie!

401
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:15,122
Oh, man. Get back.

402
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,419
Who did it?

403
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,633
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
Sorry.

404
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,635
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit, holy shit.

405
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,929
Who did it?

406
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:37,434
Mission journal entry one.

407
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:40,229
Parents have been
real easy on me.

408
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:43,815
They hope I go back to playing
computer games like other kids.

409
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:53,532
- Mom, could I have the bread?
- Mm-hmm.

410
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:57,410
- You think it's true?
- Can't be.

411
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:00,913
You know what?
Maybe we should go on a vacation.

412
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:04,416
You know, as a family?
Spend some quality time together?

413
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,417
I have plans with my friends
this break.

414
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:08,628
Where do you want to spend
this quality time, pal?

415
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:12,006
I don't know.
Anywhere.

416
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:14,300
How about Rome, Italy?

417
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:19,012
Here.

418
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,808
Super saver flights to Rome require
three weeks in advance booking...

419
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:26,936
- and a second Saturday stay.
- Where'd you get this?

420
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:29,105
Internet.

421
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,315
Shouldn't he be
on medication or something?

422
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:34,109
Josh, why Rome?

423
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:37,612
No reason. I just hear
it's a nice city to visit.

424
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:40,823
Mm-hmm. And it has nothing
to do with the fact that...

425
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,034
that's where the Vatican is
and that's where the pope lives?

426
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:46,036
Whoa.

427
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,997
The pope lives there?
How nice.

428
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,125
Maybe I can get to talk with him...

429
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,627
or maybe we can go see him.

430
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:58,630
Joshua, the pope is not God.

431
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:02,634
I know that...

432
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:06,304
but he's His best friend.

433
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:08,806
We're not going to Rome.

434
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:49,926
Dad, come on!

435
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,721
Yeah, I got it.
Thanks.

436
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,393
Mom, I can't fiind my shirt.

437
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,023
What?
Neena, I can't hear you.

438
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:08,025
Look on the back
of the laundry room door.

439
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:11,111
I ironed it yesterday.

440
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,113
Mornin'.

441
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,615
- Did it snow?
- Yeah.

442
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:19,494
But I think the rain washed it away.

443
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,287
Breakfast,Josh.

444
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:28,502
Dave stinks.

445
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:30,587
cNN stinks too.

446
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:59,696
Let's do the "Gloria" next.

447
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:02,991
This time, I want us all to sing...

448
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:06,994
because maybe, if we all sing
together with all our hearts...

449
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:11,290
our voices will rise up
out of this chapel...

450
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,416
out of this building...

451
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,418
up into the heavens.

452
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,880
Maybe if we really sing together...

453
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,383
God will hear us.

454
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:38,407
Everything's gone!

455
00:39:40,284 --> 00:39:44,288
I know, sweetie, I know.
We had to put things away sometime.

456
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:46,374
It doesn't mean that
we're forgetting about him.

457
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:49,084
No, no. Put everything back.
I want everything back.

458
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:52,796
Joshua, listen. We have to move on.
It's not good to pretend...

459
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:55,798
- No, stop it! Stop it!
- Shh.

460
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:59,093
I want to show you something.
Okay?

461
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:12,771
You can move on slowly.
There's no rush.

462
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:21,404
Journal entry three.

463
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:23,364
I gotta lighten up.

464
00:40:23,364 --> 00:40:25,366
Like Dave.

465
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:27,368
Lately, when school
gives him a headache...

466
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:31,288
- O'Hara. O'Hara?
- he just stays home.

467
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:33,999
He's probably drinkin'
Hawaiian Punch...

468
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:37,794
and watching reruns
of Gilligan's Island right now.

469
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,801
Your parents told me
you've been a busy guy lately.

470
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:50,972
They said that you started to follow
the Muslim tradition for a while.

471
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:54,267
Every day at sunset...

472
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:56,894
you'd bow your head to the ground
and pray to the east, is that right?

473
00:40:56,977 --> 00:40:59,688
I stopped that.

474
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:03,275
Okay, well, what did you
think about when you prayed?

475
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,569
Nothing, mostly.

476
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:09,781
But sometimes, I'd wonder...

477
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:13,074
"What made that smell in the carpet?"

478
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:16,161
And what was this with Thanksgiving?

479
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:19,372
You missed a good turkey dinner
because you were fasting?

480
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:22,958
I heard about a holy guy
in India who did that.

481
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:27,588
And, well,
I don't know if it counts or what...

482
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:29,589
but I got hungry during the night.

483
00:41:29,672 --> 00:41:33,259
Do you think six hours
counts as a fast?

484
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:36,387
I think six hours counts.

485
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:40,265
Joshua, why do you feel
the need to do these things?

486
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:44,186
What is it you're trying to fiind?

487
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,354
God.

488
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,982
Why?

489
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:52,360
Am-Am I doing something wrong, or...

490
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:54,362
Oh, no. No.

491
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:58,990
In fact, a lot of people spend their lives
in search of what you're looking for.

492
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,952
Only those people usually fiinish
grammar school fiirst.

493
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:10,459
Can I ask you
about your grandfather?

494
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,590
Your mom tells me
the two of you were really close.

495
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,884
In fact, this summer,you didn't
go away to camp with your friends.

496
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:23,470
You stayed home
so you could be with him.

497
00:42:26,557 --> 00:42:28,475
Do you know what happened to him?

498
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:32,270
He died of bone marrow cancer.

499
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:34,480
That's right.

500
00:42:34,564 --> 00:42:37,858
Did you get to go to the funeral?

501
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:41,653
Well, that's okay.
That's all right.

502
00:42:41,778 --> 00:42:44,281
You know, it's just that
sometimes, people...

503
00:42:44,281 --> 00:42:46,365
need a chance to cry...

504
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:48,784
to let go,
to get things out.

505
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:51,287
Maybe you never got that chance.

506
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:55,165
Know what?
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

507
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:57,167
Can I go?

508
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,670
Sure. That's all right.
You can go.

509
00:43:00,754 --> 00:43:03,255
But, hey.
This wasn't so bad, was it?

510
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,177
What do you say we get together again,
and we can talk? How 'bout...

511
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,180
- How 'bout Tuesday after school?
- Oh, sorry. I can't.

512
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:14,849
Oh, no? Why is that?

513
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:18,478
It's Hanukkah.
Well, I bought candles.

514
00:43:19,978 --> 00:43:21,646
Oh.

515
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:28,861
I think my parents
want to have a talk with me.

516
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:33,240
They look stressed.

517
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:35,951
They keep taking me places.

518
00:43:36,076 --> 00:43:40,246
Dad, how come you've been spending
so much time with me these days?

519
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,249
What, I can't spend time
with my own son? I mean...

520
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:48,170
You're not doing this
'cause you're worried about me, are you?

521
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:52,674
No. Of course not.

522
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:56,260
And every time it seems like
they're gonna say something...

523
00:43:56,344 --> 00:43:58,471
they don't.

524
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,474
I feel bad.

525
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,353
I'm wigging my parents out.

526
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:09,064
But I can't help it.

527
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,066
I can't stop thinking.

528
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,569
Joshua?

529
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,571
What's the matter?

530
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,739
You know what?

531
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:22,367
Think I just had
a "revelization. "

532
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:26,162
Really?

533
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:30,374
Yeah. I used to think
this place was magic.

534
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:35,546
I'd see the toys...
I'd see all kinds of magical worlds.

535
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:38,047
What do you see now?

536
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:45,137
Plastic.

537
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:48,932
Plastic and paint.

538
00:44:48,932 --> 00:44:54,854
Well, there's still some magic,
but it gets less and less every year.

539
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,232
Maybe by the time
I have a son...

540
00:44:58,357 --> 00:45:01,860
I won't even remember
the magic anymore.

541
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:09,033
My mom said something weird when
she dropped me at Billy's party.

542
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:13,537
She said,
"Honey, please try to have fun. "

543
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:17,458
Why'd she say that?
I know howto have fun.

544
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:21,252
Ohm

545
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:24,756
Nothing's happening.

546
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,549
Then you ain't doin' it right.

547
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:32,262
- I think I'm getting an itch.
- Don't think about it.

548
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:35,432
It's itching in two places.

549
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:39,059
You're not concentrating.

550
00:45:39,143 --> 00:45:43,230
I think I'm getting an itch too.

551
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:45,732
You guys suck.

552
00:45:45,857 --> 00:45:48,151
It's bad,Josh.

553
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:50,945
How long are we
supposed to do this?

554
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:52,946
A long time.

555
00:45:59,536 --> 00:46:02,747
Okay, you're supposed to breathe
in a certain way.

556
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,750
But I haven't fiigured
that part out yet.

557
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,127
What's supposed to happen?

558
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:15,634
Are you having a biolog...

559
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:19,136
What's it like?

560
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:22,056
Like choking on a LifeSaver,
but worse.

561
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:24,058
You can't say anything.

562
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:27,936
- Just say what you're thinking.
- I can't.

563
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:31,648
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

564
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:33,650
Just say it.

565
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:41,740
I think you're prettier than any of the
swimsuit models in the swimsuit edition.

566
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,741
Oh.

567
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:49,622
What's goin' on?

568
00:46:49,747 --> 00:46:51,749
Someone dared Dave
to jump in the pool.

569
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:54,334
- It's freezin'out there.
- He won't do it.

570
00:46:54,418 --> 00:46:56,336
Who's that?

571
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,132
That's Dave.
Dave's my best friend.

572
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:02,716
You know what?
Dave's a daredevil.

573
00:47:02,842 --> 00:47:05,928
He's not afraid of anything.
Not anything.

574
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:09,639
When he grows up,
bet he's gonna be one of those guys...

575
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:13,226
who gets shot out of a cannon
at the circus.

576
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:20,524
Let's go.

577
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,946
Whoo!

578
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,037
God?

579
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:38,039
Yeah.

580
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:41,626
You think that's crazy, don't you?

581
00:47:42,753 --> 00:47:44,628
It's different.

582
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:48,048
- No, you think it's crazy.
- It's different, okay?

583
00:47:48,048 --> 00:47:50,342
That's all I said.

584
00:48:01,518 --> 00:48:03,812
Journal entry seven.

585
00:48:03,812 --> 00:48:06,440
Dave O'Hara can do anything.

586
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:14,030
If he says it can't be done,
it can't be done.

587
00:48:14,113 --> 00:48:17,407
What can I tell ya, G-man?
consider that chapter closed.

588
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:21,620
- What d'you mean?
- I mean she probably thinks you're a mental patient.

589
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:23,830
All right,
your parents are waiting, gentlemen.

590
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,831
No running in the parking lot.

591
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:29,835
Okay, Crimmins, Hall, Nordon, Ellard.

592
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:37,008
This whole mission business
is getting out of hand.

593
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:39,135
You're wiggin', man.

594
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:41,137
Let it slide as long as possible.

595
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:44,431
- People are talkin'.
- You don't know.

596
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:47,518
I don't?
Answer me one thing:

597
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:51,021
In all this time and all the stuff
you've been doing...

598
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:54,607
have you gotten one sign...
any sign...

599
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:57,110
to let you know there is a God?

600
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:02,614
No. So what does that say?

601
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,033
I'll tell you what it says.

602
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:07,119
Either there ain't no God...

603
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:11,330
or there is a God and He don't care
that you're lookin' for Him.

604
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:15,501
Either way, it's time to stop.

605
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:20,422
O'Hara,you're up.

606
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:29,221
See you tomorrow,Josh.

607
00:49:29,304 --> 00:49:32,516
Simms, Smith,Jones, Barker.

608
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,314
Journal entry nine.

609
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:43,525
Starting to doubt my mission.

610
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:46,820
I really need a sign to know
whether to keep going or not.

611
00:49:49,614 --> 00:49:51,532
Please.

612
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,536
I need one bad.

613
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,224
Anything happen in here?

614
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,520
Hap... What d'ya mean, happen?

615
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:28,231
Well, like... lights flickering,
or a strong wind...

616
00:50:28,231 --> 00:50:30,901
or a holy vision,
anything like that.

617
00:50:33,403 --> 00:50:35,529
I- I didn't see anything, honey.
Did...

618
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:45,830
...friend who really liked the outfiit.

619
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:49,000
I'm telling you... Hold on.
What do you want, pygmy?

620
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,920
Anything godly in nature
reveal itself to you just now?

621
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:57,716
He really liked the outfiit.
Yeah, he told me about it twice.

622
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,718
I'm serious.

623
00:51:00,802 --> 00:51:04,722
My grandpa believed in two things.

624
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:09,101
I don't think I believe
in anything at all.

625
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,318
Don't start cryin',Josh.

626
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:21,320
I don't think
I could take it.

627
00:51:21,404 --> 00:51:23,989
Okay, I won't.

628
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:27,826
- Does it hurt?
- Not this second, no.

629
00:51:27,909 --> 00:51:31,496
- Are you scared?
- No.

630
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,289
- Not even a little scared?
- Uh-uh.

631
00:51:34,415 --> 00:51:37,000
Why not?

632
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:39,920
'Cause, uh...

633
00:51:40,003 --> 00:51:43,423
I know God will take care
of me when I get to Him.

634
00:51:43,423 --> 00:51:45,383
How do you know?

635
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:47,593
A man knows.

636
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:50,887
What if you get there
and you fiind out there is no God?

637
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:53,390
Who's gonna take care of you?

638
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,019
Don't talk nonsense,Josh.

639
00:51:58,103 --> 00:52:00,813
How do you know for sure?
I mean...

640
00:52:00,813 --> 00:52:03,107
lots of things are made up.

641
00:52:03,107 --> 00:52:06,902
S- S-Superman ain't real.

642
00:52:06,986 --> 00:52:10,905
Neither is Indiana Jones.
Someone just made 'em up.

643
00:52:12,407 --> 00:52:14,284
'Cause I got proof.

644
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:18,203
- What proof?
- The snow. That's proof.

645
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:20,581
How do you think
the snow appears?

646
00:52:20,706 --> 00:52:24,001
Isn't snow frozen water vapor...

647
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:27,879
that falls to the earth
in soft, white crystalline flakes?

648
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:30,006
Where'd you learn that?

649
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:32,799
Earth Science class.

650
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,677
Well, you're right...

651
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:39,598
but there's more, much more.

652
00:52:39,598 --> 00:52:43,684
Maybe you're gonna
have to fiind your own proof.

653
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:46,812
- You know what, Grandpa?
- What,Josh?

654
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:50,690
I don't wanna talk anymore.

655
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,084
- Josh.
- Yeah?

656
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:16,088
I am a little scared.

657
00:53:16,213 --> 00:53:19,883
I'm a little scared too.

658
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:22,803
Grandpa?

659
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:25,304
Is it okay if I cry now?

660
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:29,684
Yeah.

661
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,896
Oh, man.

662
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:08,771
" Fourscore and seven years ago...

663
00:55:08,896 --> 00:55:13,359
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation. "

664
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,485
Be aware of where your hands are.

665
00:55:15,485 --> 00:55:17,987
"conceived in liberty... "

666
00:55:18,071 --> 00:55:21,574
By spring,
most everybody knew about my mission...

667
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:23,575
even Robert Brickman.

668
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:27,162
Punch the end
of each sentence,John.

669
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:31,582
"Now we are engaged
in a great civil war. "

670
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,459
Watch out, Brickman.

671
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:35,670
Okay, everybody face forward.

672
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:38,589
And you can continue,John.

673
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:43,176
"Testing whether that nation... "

674
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,554
Everyone, look forward.

675
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:51,266
He's touching the pope.

676
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,190
Mission journal entry.

677
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,984
Robert Brickman
took the pope hostage today.

678
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,489
Look, there's Robert!

679
00:56:17,456 --> 00:56:20,584
- What's he doing?
- Why is he holding the picture up like that?

680
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:25,964
Somebody please go tell Sister Josephine
that Robert's out in the rain with the pope.

681
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:28,675
The whole class
thought he was wiggin'out again.

682
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:31,176
But not me.

683
00:56:31,176 --> 00:56:35,973
I think he was trying to tell me
something about my mission.

684
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:38,851
Somethin' was gonna happen.

685
00:56:38,976 --> 00:56:42,770
Somethin'strange.

686
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,689
- Please sit down.
- No, I'm not gonna go.

687
00:56:44,689 --> 00:56:46,858
- Listen, baby, you gotta understand...
- No!

688
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:48,984
I'm not gonna go.
I can't leave.

689
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:51,486
I need you to listen to me, okay?

690
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,448
No one wants to take you out of school
in the middle of the semester.

691
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:57,074
No one.
I don't,'your parents don't.

692
00:56:57,158 --> 00:57:00,286
They want to keep you in school,
but they just can't aff,ord it.

693
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:04,665
Now I know you're gonna be a big man
and do what's best for your parents.

694
00:57:04,748 --> 00:57:07,459
Please, come sit down.

695
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:21,055
It's gonna be okay.

696
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,556
It's gonna be all right.

697
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,157
Next.

698
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:48,870
Hey,Josh.

699
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,043
- Is today tomorrow?
- Next.

700
00:57:55,168 --> 00:57:57,044
Just leave me alone, Frank.

701
00:58:00,964 --> 00:58:02,841
Next.

702
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:14,851
Did you ever notice that Freddie wears
the same pants he wore last year...

703
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:16,853
just let out a little?

704
00:58:16,853 --> 00:58:19,773
I can't say I know much
about Freddie's pants.

705
00:58:19,773 --> 00:58:23,567
And whenever we get new textbooks,
Freddie gets the used ones...

706
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:25,736
- from the class before.
- Shh, shh, shh!

707
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:29,740
This ceremony is
very special to the girls.

708
00:58:29,864 --> 00:58:34,244
It's important to them,
and it should be important to you.

709
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:37,247
Now you stand like prefect gentlemen.
Fold your hands.

710
00:58:38,372 --> 00:58:42,167
Eyes forward.
Backs straight.

711
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:45,170
And enjoy yourselves.

712
00:59:05,354 --> 00:59:07,231
Isn't that your woman?

713
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,736
That's her.

714
00:59:12,861 --> 00:59:15,363
She's hot.

715
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,365
She's beautiful.

716
00:59:56,441 --> 00:59:59,653
Have you found
what you're looking for?

717
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:04,239
You will.

718
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:20,629
Something is defiinitely happening.

719
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:26,259
Murphy,your dad's here.
- Bye.

720
01:00:30,638 --> 01:00:32,723
Waltman.

721
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:38,853
Freddie Waltman?

722
01:00:57,245 --> 01:00:59,122
You okay?

723
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,041
Are you ready?

724
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,043
Freddie Waltman has
picked on me since I was in third grade.

725
01:01:07,254 --> 01:01:09,423
He pushed me in a locker...

726
01:01:09,548 --> 01:01:12,133
put cherry Jell-O in my sneakers...

727
01:01:12,216 --> 01:01:15,845
and told everyone
when I split my pants in Social Studies.

728
01:01:18,723 --> 01:01:20,640
What is wrong with me?

729
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:23,351
Today should be the happiest day
of my life.

730
01:01:23,435 --> 01:01:25,645
I think he's leaving.

731
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:35,446
- Hey, wait, wait! Stop, please!
- Joshua!

732
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:38,031
Wait!

733
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:51,835
Bye, Freddie.

734
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,016
Bye,Josh.

735
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:48,426
Stay together, gentlemen!
Don't touch anything!

736
01:02:48,718 --> 01:02:51,346
If you break it,
you bought it!

737
01:02:51,346 --> 01:02:53,931
Stay in line. Stand up straight.
There is a buddy system.

738
01:02:54,014 --> 01:02:58,018
If you're lost,
please fiind your buddy.

739
01:02:58,143 --> 01:03:02,230
No fiighting, no kicking,
no pulling and no getting lost.

740
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:10,612
- What are you doing?
- Let's go through together.

741
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:14,241
- I can't even breathe. Get out!
- Come on. Everyone's waiting.

742
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:16,243
Oh.

743
01:03:18,412 --> 01:03:22,123
- Something caught?
- Don't push anymore. We can't fiit.

744
01:03:22,123 --> 01:03:24,125
Turn it back.

745
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:29,504
Aw, you dweeb! The turnstile doesn't
go back. Now I'm pushing forward.

746
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:31,840
- No!
- Okay, excuse me!

747
01:03:31,923 --> 01:03:33,800
Gentlemen, calm down!
Please let me through.

748
01:03:33,925 --> 01:03:35,927
Calm down!
Get in line, please!

749
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:38,929
Single fiile was what I said, right?
What's happening, boys?

750
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:40,931
- Sister, we're stuck.
- You're stuck?

751
01:03:40,931 --> 01:03:43,100
- Yes.
- Really? And how did you get stuck?

752
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,935
Billy and Newman went through together.
I thought, maybe,Josh and I...

753
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:49,731
- Do you do everything that Billy and Newman do?
- No, Sister, I don't.

754
01:03:49,731 --> 01:03:52,734
I certainly should hope not.
Are you all right,Joshua?

755
01:03:52,817 --> 01:03:55,319
Stay right here. I'll get some help.

756
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:59,406
Be quiet! Try to be calm.
Single fiile! Sir.

757
01:04:00,616 --> 01:04:03,618
I think they're stuck.

758
01:04:03,701 --> 01:04:07,622
- Joshua.
- What do you want?

759
01:04:07,622 --> 01:04:11,207
I think I'm gonna blow chunks.

760
01:04:11,207 --> 01:04:13,209
- Um, no chunk-blowing, Frank, okay?
- Yes, Sister.

761
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:16,630
If you could, I would appreciate...
That's not funny! Is that funny?

762
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,596
It took two workmen
20 minutes to pry us out.

763
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:31,100
A crowd of over 300 people
stopped by to watch.

764
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:33,102
I hate field trips.

765
01:04:35,729 --> 01:04:38,315
What a fat turd.

766
01:04:38,398 --> 01:04:41,193
He's gonna weigh like
5,000 pounds when he grows up.

767
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:46,822
I better complete my mission soon.

768
01:04:48,616 --> 01:04:50,826
I think I'm really losing it.

769
01:05:02,628 --> 01:05:04,922
You know what, Frank?

770
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:06,924
What?

771
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,718
Today is tomorrow.

772
01:05:13,805 --> 01:05:17,809
Yesterday was yesterday
and today is tomorrow. Right?

773
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:20,811
Right.

774
01:05:20,894 --> 01:05:24,398
So you wanna go make fun
of those ugly statues over there?

775
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:30,611
Hey, Frank, you're not
gonna blow chunks on me, are you?

776
01:05:33,322 --> 01:05:35,323
Come on.

777
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:31,790
Hey,Josh.

778
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,792
Josh...

779
01:06:36,502 --> 01:06:39,088
Dave said he got one of his...

780
01:06:39,213 --> 01:06:41,716
"I didn't study for my test"headaches.

781
01:06:41,716 --> 01:06:44,092
Said he couldn't see
the questions.

782
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:46,678
Everything got blurry.

783
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:50,682
He told me we had to go
on a secret agent assignment.

784
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:54,310
That's code for something
no one could ever know about.

785
01:06:54,393 --> 01:06:58,105
Something really, really dangerous.

786
01:06:58,105 --> 01:07:01,983
Something...
that could get you detention.

787
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:05,403
Okay, just eye that hallway, all right?

788
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:13,786
Here it is.

789
01:07:13,911 --> 01:07:17,206
- Huh? Did you fiind it?
- Just keep looking.

790
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:31,385
- Want me to fiix yours?
- No, no.

791
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:35,096
I did all right. And remember
I'm not involved with this at all.

792
01:07:43,395 --> 01:07:46,106
- Secret agent red light. Secret agent red light.
- Wait.

793
01:07:46,106 --> 01:07:48,108
- I'm not fiinished yet.
- Oh, it's all over.

794
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:50,777
We're gonna be arrested
and "incarcemated. "

795
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:54,405
Qick, over here.

796
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:00,785
- Here she comes.
- Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

797
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,288
Blessed art thou amongst women
and blessed is the fru...

798
01:08:36,984 --> 01:08:38,986
She took the tests.

799
01:08:43,781 --> 01:08:45,783
- Flynn.
- Here.

800
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:47,785
- Newman.
- Here.

801
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:51,079
O'Hara.

802
01:08:51,163 --> 01:08:53,373
O'Hara?

803
01:08:53,498 --> 01:08:56,084
- Pasquale.
- Here.

804
01:08:56,168 --> 01:08:58,462
- Rafalski.
- Here.

805
01:09:06,969 --> 01:09:08,970
Hey.

806
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,972
- You know what?
- Hmm?

807
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:14,684
Dave was out sick today.
Maybe we could stop by on the way home.

808
01:09:14,768 --> 01:09:16,685
Sure.

809
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:27,362
Okay.
Make it quick.

810
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:31,282
I can tell you
everything that happened that afternoon.

811
01:09:31,282 --> 01:09:35,661
- Hello?
- Mrs. O'Hara was upstairs taking a nap.

812
01:09:35,786 --> 01:09:37,871
Dave?

813
01:09:37,996 --> 01:09:41,792
Mr. O'Hara
was still working downtown.

814
01:09:41,874 --> 01:09:43,793
Dave?

815
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:46,796
And Dave was in
the galactic battleship.

816
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:50,590
You're supposed to be sick,
not having galactic battles.

817
01:10:10,775 --> 01:10:14,487
I just found out my best friend,
Dave, has epilepsy.

818
01:10:15,572 --> 01:10:18,991
Epilepsy is a sickness
you're born with.

819
01:10:19,074 --> 01:10:21,577
It can strike at any age.

820
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:26,289
When it hits,
you lose control of your body...

821
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:28,583
you shake real hard...

822
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:31,377
and then you black out.

823
01:10:31,377 --> 01:10:33,878
The warning signs of epilepsy...

824
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:37,966
are blurry vision...
and headaches.

825
01:10:38,049 --> 01:10:41,969
Mom!

826
01:11:00,277 --> 01:11:02,863
I talked to Dave's dad at the hospital.

827
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:04,865
Dave's stable.

828
01:11:04,865 --> 01:11:07,283
He's bruised up a little.

829
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:11,871
I mean, that closet
you guys play in is very small.

830
01:11:11,954 --> 01:11:14,373
And when someone has a seizure...

831
01:11:14,457 --> 01:11:17,459
their arms and their legs
move so fast...

832
01:11:17,584 --> 01:11:19,461
they need a lot of room.

833
01:11:19,586 --> 01:11:21,463
Is he hurt bad?

834
01:11:21,546 --> 01:11:24,965
Dave fractured
his arm against one of the walls.

835
01:11:24,965 --> 01:11:26,967
He's gonna be okay.

836
01:11:26,967 --> 01:11:29,762
His condition
can be treated with medicine.

837
01:11:29,762 --> 01:11:33,848
Hopefully, he'll be back
playing with you in a couple of weeks.

838
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,862
Final journal entry.

839
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:53,074
Know what?

840
01:11:53,157 --> 01:11:55,660
My grandpa was wrong.

841
01:11:57,078 --> 01:11:58,954
Someone just made God up.

842
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:06,961
On your marks, get set...

843
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:18,972
- Is that it?
- Uh-huh.

844
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,142
Come on.

845
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:29,648
The winners of our sixth grade
100-yard dash are...

846
01:12:29,773 --> 01:12:31,650
in third place, Wayne Hiller...

847
01:12:31,775 --> 01:12:34,735
second place, Mike McFarland:
fiirst place, Andrew Dow.

848
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,572
Let's have a round of applause
for our Waldron athletes.

849
01:12:49,748 --> 01:12:51,667
I'm gonna win this for my grandpa.

850
01:12:56,547 --> 01:12:59,048
On your marks, get set...

851
01:13:04,262 --> 01:13:06,847
Go,Joshua!
Go! Go!

852
01:13:22,361 --> 01:13:24,863
I don't remember much about that day.

853
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:29,367
I don't remember who won
or how long I was on the ground.

854
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:32,536
- The winner of our fourth grade...
- Sister.

855
01:13:32,661 --> 01:13:35,331
My grandson hasn't
fiinished the race.

856
01:13:41,961 --> 01:13:46,132
I do remember thinking this was the end.

857
01:13:46,257 --> 01:13:48,343
My grandpa would never
see me run again.

858
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:52,846
One of the last things
I remember about my grandpa...

859
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:56,558
was the way he stood
at the fiinish line...

860
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:58,935
waiting to say good-bye.

861
01:14:49,938 --> 01:14:52,357
- He takes the lead!
- Oh, no! My engine's overheated.

862
01:14:52,357 --> 01:14:54,859
- All right. How many laps left?
- Ten.

863
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:05,618
- It hurt?
- A little.

864
01:15:05,743 --> 01:15:08,121
You scared?

865
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:12,333
You don't gotta be
scared no more.

866
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,253
- Hey,Josh?
- Yeah?

867
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:19,423
- I don't think you should give up your mission.
- I think you were right.

868
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,842
Bad things just happen,
and people die.

869
01:15:22,842 --> 01:15:25,219
And there's no one there
to take care of them.

870
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:27,930
It's just the way things are.

871
01:15:34,227 --> 01:15:36,146
I believe now.

872
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:40,441
When I was in
the galactic battleship...

873
01:15:40,524 --> 01:15:42,443
you walked in.

874
01:15:42,526 --> 01:15:44,737
It was like a miracle.

875
01:15:48,114 --> 01:15:50,033
It was no miracle.

876
01:15:50,116 --> 01:15:53,036
Why do you think you just
popped by my house that day?

877
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:55,538
Why do you think
you just walked in then?

878
01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:57,539
Lucky.

879
01:15:57,623 --> 01:16:00,042
No. It was more.

880
01:16:04,546 --> 01:16:07,423
Just don't give it up, dork.

881
01:16:20,644 --> 01:16:22,645
Joshua?

882
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:24,730
It's 7:00.

883
01:16:35,532 --> 01:16:38,243
Honey.

884
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:40,827
Josh?

885
01:16:40,911 --> 01:16:43,330
Last day.
Let's not be late. Come on.

886
01:17:00,637 --> 01:17:03,640
"I like when Sister
Beatrice lost her whistle for a week.

887
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:09,019
I like when Offiicer Price came in
on Career Day and showed us his gun.

888
01:17:09,144 --> 01:17:13,022
I like when school was cancelled 'cause
the pipes in the basement busted. "

889
01:17:13,106 --> 01:17:15,233
Knees.

890
01:17:15,316 --> 01:17:19,404
"I like the new lemonade they served in the
cafeteria this year: the old one sucked.

891
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:23,031
I like that I turned 11
this year. The end. "

892
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:29,121
Very repetitive, Dan. Fifteen sentences
beginning with "I like. "

893
01:17:29,204 --> 01:17:31,330
My dad didn't help me, neither.

894
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:36,919
Okay,Joshua A. Beal.

895
01:17:42,716 --> 01:17:45,802
" Fifth grade was
the most rigorous year yet. "

896
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:48,804
Rigorous or toughest?
Eye contact,Joshua.

897
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:51,515
" Rigorous and toughest year yet.

898
01:17:52,933 --> 01:17:56,603
Before this year,
everything was Batman action fiigures...

899
01:17:56,728 --> 01:17:58,605
and Ninja Turtle cartoons. "

900
01:17:58,605 --> 01:18:00,815
Relax your shoulders.

901
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:05,235
" Now there's family,
friends and... girls. "

902
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:08,405
Shh! Quiet!

903
01:18:10,324 --> 01:18:12,325
" Before this year...

904
01:18:12,408 --> 01:18:15,828
bullies...
were just bullies for no reason.

905
01:18:17,496 --> 01:18:19,916
Weirdos... were just weird.

906
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,502
And daredevils...

907
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:27,005
weren't afraid of anything.

908
01:18:33,219 --> 01:18:35,513
Before this year...

909
01:18:35,596 --> 01:18:38,014
people I loved lived forever.

910
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:45,396
I spent this year
looking for something...

911
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:48,607
and wound up seeing
everything around me.

912
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:53,028
It's like I was asleep before
and fiinally woke up.

913
01:18:58,991 --> 01:19:00,993
You know what?

914
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:04,829
I'm wide awake now. "

915
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:22,929
Well, gentlemen...

916
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:25,807
on behalf of the WaldronAcademy
faculty and staff,...

917
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:27,892
thank you for
another successful year.

918
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:32,312
We hope you've enjoyed it
as much as we have.

919
01:19:32,312 --> 01:19:34,398
We all wish Sister Sophia good luck...

920
01:19:34,523 --> 01:19:37,317
as she spends the summer
fiinishing up her poetry book...

921
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,987
now entitled,
The Pope Sat On The Jungle Gym.

922
01:19:41,112 --> 01:19:43,489
Good luck, Sister.

923
01:19:43,614 --> 01:19:46,408
Sister Beatrice hopes that you
will all do your summer reading.

924
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:49,411
If you need to contact her, she will be
conducting summer school here...

925
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:53,290
with some of our
more free-spirited students.

926
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:55,499
You know who you are.

927
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,712
And for those of you students involved in
the bucket incident earlier this year...

928
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,423
you may still come forward
and apologize...

929
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:05,884
to our distinguished janitor, Mr. Kent.

930
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:09,888
You will not be punished.
I just need to know who it is.

931
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:12,389
Father Peters would like
everyone to know...

932
01:20:12,389 --> 01:20:16,185
that he will be available for
confessions throughout the summer...

933
01:20:16,185 --> 01:20:18,520
for anyone who feels the need.

934
01:20:18,604 --> 01:20:21,898
And I know many of you will.

935
01:20:21,898 --> 01:20:25,610
And fiinally, Mr. Lucas
has generously volunteered...

936
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:28,112
to devote
his entire vacation to nurse...

937
01:20:28,196 --> 01:20:31,907
89-year-old Sister constance
back to health.

938
01:20:34,117 --> 01:20:36,119
We're all expecting a full recovery.

939
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:44,793
- Yes, Frank?
- May I please go to the bathroom, Sister Terry?

940
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:47,378
Uh, no, Frank, you may not.

941
01:20:47,504 --> 01:20:51,007
Okay, gentlemen, in 20 more minutes,
you are free men.

942
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,009
Stand up straight and smile, please.

943
01:20:58,889 --> 01:21:00,891
We're missing someone.

944
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,481
I'll get him.

945
01:21:12,108 --> 01:21:15,111
Oh, no, we're okay.
We're okay,Joshua! Come on back in!

946
01:21:20,991 --> 01:21:23,494
They need you
for the class picture.

947
01:21:23,577 --> 01:21:26,080
I'm not in your class.

948
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,081
You're not?

949
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:32,502
Hey, what's your name?

950
01:21:32,502 --> 01:21:35,004
You don't know my name?

951
01:21:36,588 --> 01:21:40,300
This is the fiirst time
you're seeing me, isn't it?

952
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,302
I see you all the time.

953
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:45,179
You're always around,
always smiling.

954
01:21:47,682 --> 01:21:49,892
And always watching me.

955
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:56,106
This is the fiirst time
you're really seeing me.

956
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:00,110
I guess so.

957
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:06,574
You don't have to worry.
He's happy now.

958
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:11,786
Who? Dave?
Yeah, he'll be all right.

959
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:15,373
Not David.

960
01:22:19,793 --> 01:22:22,796
I better get back.
They're taking a picture.

961
01:22:31,095 --> 01:22:33,306
You mean Grandpa?

962
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:40,103
Oh.

963
01:22:58,995 --> 01:23:01,663
My name is Joshua A. Beal.

964
01:23:01,663 --> 01:23:05,167
I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

965
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:08,170
I believe two things;'

966
01:23:08,295 --> 01:23:12,089
Not all angels have wings.

967
01:23:12,173 --> 01:23:14,175
And...

968
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,178
sixth grade's gotta be easier than this.
